2021-04-30 18:04:09,wallstreetbets,Gonna have 4% inflation in 12 days
2021-04-30 18:17:45,wallstreetbets,I need some more inflation so stocks can go up maybe 10% more that'd be nice instead of the dollar shooting up and getting our asses gaped
2021-04-30 18:54:55,wallstreetbets,I'm going to inverse you and do puts on lean hogs
2021-04-30 19:05:53,wallstreetbets,I think I had a gut feeling when they discontinued the M2
2021-04-30 18:58:55,wallstreetbets,Base effect.
2021-04-30 18:20:44,wallstreetbets,"Mainly due to supply issues, rising fuel costs, and insane amounts of development going on. Im in construction, its tough getting materials, and prices have doubled when you do find it"
2021-04-30 18:16:44,wallstreetbets,"Lean hogs eat oats, so any increase in the price of a lean hog is probably offset by the increase in the price of oats. 

Really frustrating time to be a lean hog farmer right now."
2021-04-30 19:36:00,wallstreetbets,"Single digits inflation maybe but not seeing this getting too far out of hand:
*Lumber is up but stumpage fees are not,  we can cut more trees into lumber,  it's the trees that are the problem 
*Alot of our goods have unlimited supply at current prices, this includes all of our digital goods
*Price will increase supply very quickly 
*if you want to hold currency, they break down to those you want less than USD and those that are oversold.  All of USD is held overseas and won't compete for goods in the USA and don't see folks wanting any of the other big currencies
*Demand for many goods that are exhustable: Trees, hotel rooms, airplane seats, Restaurant seats still have lingering demand issues"

2021-04-30 18:25:36,wallstreetbets,All I read was buy Wheat.
2021-04-30 18:21:13,wallstreetbets,This is kind of obvious. Our government was going on for a while about how China was manipulating currency (devaluation) to make it more competitive on the global market. Since then our government has been spending tons of money they don't have and pushing the fed to flood the market with that monopoly money we call the U.S. Dollar. I highly doubt this was done for our benefit as it's been played off publically. Remember when currency is devalued it just means they can get people to do more for less as long as they control the means of production because wages are the last thing to go up (see our absurd minimum wage situation) . Money is just a means of control for the masses and the screws are being turned hard right now as everyone (wealthy) looks to compete for hemogony in this connected global economy.
2021-04-30 18:36:17,wallstreetbets,"So puts on growth stonks I guess. 

These cost inputs are higher, but in a lot of cases it only increases the cost to make products by a few percent. Especially food. Although for homes, all those cost input increases have been way higher. Makes sense homes are up way more. 

You know it‚Äôs interesting, the prices of everything at winco just keeps going down (or up a few pennies) and the price of everything at the Kroger brand store keeps going up. I guess it goes to show public companies only care about their profit margins in the short term. Don‚Äôt care about long term happiness of consumer. Mistake, imo."
2021-04-30 18:10:10,wallstreetbets,This isn‚Äôt surprising. Inflating the $ supply = inflation of prices of goods. They regularly remove / add things to the CPI that suits their needs.

2021-04-30 19:54:53,wallstreetbets,Hahahlololhalolhaha
2021-04-30 18:39:51,wallstreetbets,"You're right, oddly enough our minimum wage hasn't adjusted to meet inflation for decades so we aren't even worth being placated in that way by the powers that be. As the population continues to spiral out of control essential commodities and real estate are going to go through the roof making them near unobtainable for a whole generation to come. Nothing short of Thanos snapping his fingers is going to save us from this."
2021-04-30 18:43:41,wallstreetbets,"Yea the Kroger brand store is closer. But I go out of my way to hit up the Winco, prices are definitely lower there. Probs not for everything. But price of carne asada is still the same price per pound as before pandemic. Gotta love the commitment to low cost"
2021-04-30 18:19:19,wallstreetbets,If they (the government) actually acknowledges inflation it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs so high they‚Äôd lose all credibility if they denied it

2021-04-30 19:46:13,wallstreetbets,"Sneks are thought to have evolved from terrestrial¬†lizards¬†as early as the Middle Jurassic Epoch (174.1 million to 163.5 million years ago). The oldest known fossil snek, Eophis underwoodi, was a small snek that lived in southern England about 167 million years ago.Many species of sneks have¬†skulls¬†with several more joints than their¬†lizard¬†ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their¬†highly mobile jaws. Sneks can and do fart. ... In a healthy snek, farts are infrequent and unlikely to be heard and smelt. Interestingly, some species of sneks fart as a defensive mechanism to ward off predators."

He tells her he owns a 1904 ford Thunderbird. 

So she reiterates ""do you own any vehicle made after the year 2008.""

So he tells her he has a 1957 Chevy Lincoln.

This bitch that's trying to scam him starts getting pissy at him.

She says in a cunty ass tone ""made after 2008. I told you twice it has to be made after 2008."" Like shes doing him a fucking favor and he isn't understanding.

So he tells her he has a 2010 Chrysler Chevy and she hangs up.

I would add in addition to Chris, it changed during the few weeks also from

>**alternatives**

to **now**

>**partners**

&#x200B;

Chris pointed also out that it is **plural**, so that there are > 1 possible parties interested in buying at the share price level at the time of the CC, so at > $20.

Buyout was never sooner and likelier than now, Closing likely soon.

MVIS is a fine company but it should be trading for a much much lower valuation except for the capital it raised diluting shareholders. It is a meme stock largely. Momentum trading.

I know it's great to be a patriot etc, I am EU I have a half-track full of shares in Renault and a lot of my DD is watching manufacturers panic and scramble to get on the right end of this without loosing face about ""their"" in-house designs. Built-in batteries for EVs are already outdated tech and the MANUFACTURERS know it. Ask them.

NIO is IMPLANTED their tech is MATURE - I am totally serious about this and put my money on the line. Everyone make their own choice.  Let's see how \*long\* it takes, is the one question.

Tesla's are great but fucking hell, they are so expensive, nobody over here can afford them.

On top of that, I have to pay ¬£1.30 (that $1.80) for a litre of fuel. Thats right, not a gallon, **a fucking litre**.

Now, even though my 530 gets a happy 34mpg on normal driving, I like to drive like a prick and it costs me a fortune because it guzzles fuel, even for a diesel, when you put the power down.

I also have to give these government pricks ¬£400 per year in road tax, whereas elec vehicles pay 0. 

I'm sus about NIO because I'm sus about all Chinese companies as they all have potential to be bullshit Aerotyne nonsense, but if NIO can make a Tesla, for half the price, then fucking count me in."

Renault was selling it in 2008 but no one was really ready for EV so the forecourts didnt take it up, folk didnt take it up, Renault altered chassis put fixed batteries built into the modified swap cars .. but I understand they are coming back to it, they have to face the competition. If forecourts HAVE 3-min battery change, then WHO is going to wait 30 mins for a charge? Me? You? Are you CRAZY? - Are you UNEMPLOYED?"

2021-04-30 17:28:48,wallstreetbets,The 3 minute battery change is a good idea but what if the battery they give at the changing station is shite? Can you get just get a new one? And who owns the batteries anyways? Yeah i know this is a DD about investing in the company but i like what NIO and TSLA are doing and probably will buy an EV when i have the money for it. So i'm asking more as consumer.

We were at urinals and I thought it would be funny to pee on him because I was that age so I peed on his feet. There was a random spray bottle on the floor and he grabbed it, probably assuming it was water. He sprayed it at me and a couple drops hit my foot. It was near a beach so all we had on was bathing suits so it hit my bare foot. It literally instantly burned my foot. I have two raised scars from it still 30 years later. Thank the maker it didn't hit my face.

I have no idea what chemical it was but it was probably about the most powerful acid possible as the burn was instant."

2021-04-30 17:16:56,wallstreetbets,"Ammo prices skyrocketed last year with the pandemic and BLM protests. Everytime there is a fear of gun control or in this case civil unrest, there is a run on guns and ammo.

It's too easy to just blame Biden. It's a liberal agenda beyond Biden for more gun control.

IMHO in a gun nut but I don't wear a tin foil hat. The guy who shot up the FedEx was 18 and had no issues legally buying long guns.  First time buyer as well. Did everything legally.

I would love to see actual training and a background check. ""Well regulated militia"" requirement would fit here so you need training including maintenance, gun ediquette and ""know your rights"" training to better understand when to use lethal force. These laws differ from state to state.

However, Trump was not responsible for the BLM riots while I would argue that, again, Biden and his party were.

Covid came later and caused a Democrat run on ammo which made it worse but it was already bad.

2021-04-30 17:33:55,wallstreetbets,"Yup, I do. It's a potential issue for a downturn. It makes FB less safe than any of the other big guys (AAMG).

But just like Netflix and its issue of a potential subscriber wall, BABA and China politics, or Tesla and their overinflated market cap with EV competition on the rise. I am just saying I don't get personal on how I feel about the company or if I use their products. For now FB is making a ton of money and you can either take a small position and ride them up and get out when trouble brews, or just invest in other companies that you feel more comfortable with.

2021-04-30 16:57:40,wallstreetbets,"Transfer out of Robinhood!! Fidelity takes less than 24 hours, I literally just did it"
2021-04-30 18:54:42,wallstreetbets,"Say there was another squeeze. Robinhood might go in maintenance mode, the squeeze lasts for an hour, you‚Äôre finally able to sell..for $120 or less. I‚Äôm not saying this will happen but I‚Äôve seen something like this happen."
2021-04-30 14:28:42,wallstreetbets,This is the way

2021-04-30 15:52:57,wallstreetbets,I had to scroll down way to far to find this comment. Transfer TODAY out of there.
2021-04-30 18:54:39,wallstreetbets,You'd think 86k would buy some sense. Hell I transfered everything except my bit of a share that wouldn't transfer.
2021-04-30 16:05:32,wallstreetbets,Some of us (me lol) owe Fidelity money so transferring there isn't an option. What's the next best broker for people like us (me)?
2021-04-30 15:54:23,wallstreetbets,What do you guys trade with? Sorry for being a casual ü•∫

2021-04-30 18:24:47,wallstreetbets,If I transferred out of Robinhood where do you think I should transfer to?

2021-04-30 15:29:33,wallstreetbets,Selling was never restricted.
2021-04-30 14:54:56,wallstreetbets,"Say what you want. Robinhood is the only broker that has actually let me vote my gme shares. Fidelity is holding them from my account for another week after talking to a rep. Webull says my shares were loaned out even though I had the share lending program disabled and now I can't vote them.

At this point robinhood has let me vote my 150 shares, and fidelity is holding my 300 shares hostage, and webull is scum giving away my 10 shares there."
2021-04-30 16:19:22,wallstreetbets,Average volume is \~28m. You take that times the $170 and you have $4.76b. These yolos are rounding errors. Reddit barely moves the needle. It is when other billion dollar hedge funds decide to play is when it moves.
2021-04-30 17:41:42,wallstreetbets,People who don't understand how things work resort to conspiracy
2021-04-30 18:59:00,wallstreetbets,"They were clearly never going to let it go above 180 this week, because that‚Äôs the game for the weekly calls they sold. It‚Äôs all a max pain game for weeks where it doesn‚Äôt have huge news. It‚Äôll go up long term, but in the meantime, big money makes huge amounts in premiums selling weekly calls and they can control the price very easily on low volume days to guarantee profit."
2021-04-30 19:13:47,wallstreetbets,"Actually, I think it's starting to act like a real stock with regular gains.  Now that initial price discovery is mostly done people are realizing that this is a real company with a future.  Buy shares and hold.  In one year you are guaranteed 100% gain IMO.  This is the new TSLA."
2021-04-30 17:35:21,wallstreetbets,Nobody is selling? If that‚Äôs the case‚Ä¶ how are people buying?
2021-04-30 17:43:31,wallstreetbets,"Won't move with RH, you'll be on margin no matter what. You need to be on Fidelity or Vanguard."

Edit: so y‚Äôall would rather downvote me then just give me a simple answer lmao üòÇ"
2021-04-30 16:18:28,wallstreetbets,Vanguard. I would even recommend them over Fidelity because of their unusual ownership structure.
2021-04-30 16:27:51,wallstreetbets,"Vanguard, TD Ameritrade, or Schwab are the only ones that won‚Äôt fuck you if you‚Äôre holding GME. There‚Äôs been some doubt about Schwab recently though popping up in the comments"
2021-04-30 17:00:25,wallstreetbets,SoFi works well for me. Took 3 days to transfer
2021-04-30 15:56:24,wallstreetbets,Td ameritrade for me
2021-04-30 16:04:24,wallstreetbets,Fidelity
2021-04-30 16:34:01,wallstreetbets,"I just switched to Fidelity, based on what many users suggested. Interface isn‚Äôt as slick as RH, but when RH liquidated all my stocks except for GME and FCEL, and took a week to transfer the money, I knew it was a big middle finger from them...

2021-04-30 16:23:52,wallstreetbets,TD Ameritrade
2021-04-30 16:05:39,wallstreetbets,You're breathtaking
2021-04-30 14:59:18,wallstreetbets,compared to who? There are dozens of commission free brokers now
2021-04-30 16:00:27,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood is still in the doghouse, however, when day trading, commission adds up fast.  I had to pick my poison."
2021-04-30 18:28:07,wallstreetbets,Fidelity or Vangaurd. They are the two brokerages with the most capital. I‚Äôm not sure about vanguard but fidelity had their own clearing house also.
2021-04-30 15:40:26,wallstreetbets,Yes buying was because of a supposed ‚Äúliquidity issue‚Äù. Do u honestly believe they‚Äôll let people sell their shares at all time highs when they had a liquidity problem when shares reached 400+?
2021-04-30 15:41:07,wallstreetbets,I would be astonished if people were able to sell shares at 1000+ on Robinhood
2021-04-30 15:11:08,wallstreetbets,Also what does voting matter if once a squeeze is triggered u can‚Äôt even sell lol or better yet they sell for u.
2021-04-30 15:09:52,wallstreetbets,Did u vote or are they voting for you? From what I‚Äôve heard everyone that transfers over from Robinhood to fidelity shows that their shares were in margin on fidelity even if they thought they had them in cash on Robinhood. How can you vote with shares that u don‚Äôt even actually own.

2021-04-30 14:56:42,wallstreetbets,Ok I will.
2021-04-30 15:28:09,wallstreetbets,The only from RH
2021-04-30 17:16:16,wallstreetbets,"Open a brokerage account with fidelity and when it asks for the source of funding the account, select the option to transfer from another brokerage. Most the time they have an interface to every main brokerage, you just log into your robinhood account through fidelity and they take care of it"
2021-04-30 17:18:14,wallstreetbets,"you sign up on a new broker, like fidelity. you initiate a transfer. 

&#x200B;

ROBBINGHOOD HAS TOTAL CONTROL OF YOUR SHARES, YOU SIGNED THE TOS AND THEY CAN SELL YOUR SHARES WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE IT."
2021-04-30 18:26:09,wallstreetbets,"Schwab, Fidelity, or Vanguard."
2021-04-30 18:28:16,wallstreetbets,They closed buying GME and lied about the reason. The real reason was they didn‚Äôt have liquidity secondary to under capitalization. I was listening to Bloomberg the entire day that happened and they interviewed several people who basically gave the gist from RH that is was closed because of redditors manipulating markets.
2021-04-30 18:24:39,wallstreetbets,Robinhood stinky üëé
2021-04-30 16:24:48,wallstreetbets,Care to elaborate?
2021-04-30 16:31:42,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve seen some skepticism towards TDA as well recently in regards to customer service‚Äôs response towards voting questions
2021-04-30 17:44:29,wallstreetbets,What about E Trade?
2021-04-30 18:22:01,wallstreetbets,Nobody ever mentions etrade...I'm in etrade...am I in trouble? Lol
2021-04-30 19:40:53,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs this about Schwab?
2021-04-30 18:07:43,wallstreetbets,I hold onto positions so much longer there because the mobile app is so clunky.
2021-04-30 17:09:48,wallstreetbets,Fidelity is working on a new interface for the app [Fidelity Upgrade](https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/n0fvgz/meet_the_new_fidelity_mobile_beta_trading/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
2021-04-30 17:39:37,wallstreetbets,Why did RH liquidate your stocks? During transfer? Were they partial shares?
2021-04-30 19:21:24,wallstreetbets,Biden recognizes Taiwan as its own country and suddenly your stocks are gone üá®üá≥
2021-04-30 16:27:20,wallstreetbets,Your nickname is breathtaking
2021-04-30 19:07:15,wallstreetbets,Fidelity is free trades. Shit the list of who charges is probably smaller then those who don‚Äôt.
2021-04-30 18:48:25,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood is the absolute worst for day trading. They scalp from your limit orders on literally every trade. It‚Äôs not too bad if you‚Äôre just buying long on a stock. It‚Äôs really bad when the decimal amounts on your trades matter. Are there even really any retail platforms that charge a commission any more? Etrade has a .50 commission on options only but that‚Äôs really where RH screws it‚Äôs users over. Believe me, you‚Äôre paying one way or another."
2021-04-30 16:06:31,wallstreetbets,"... yes, because the issue was the deposit requirements from their clearinghouse for users buying volatile stocks.  Selling does not have those requirements, which is why they did not ever restrict it, and have no reason to.

If you are actually curious about what happened and why, there is a very clear explanation at:
https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week

Most people are not actually interested, obviously, which is why these kinds of conspiracy theories are so prevalent and anyone providing actual information gets downvoted.  So if, like most, you want to just keep being angry at Robinhood, that's fine too, that fits right in with how this sub works now."
2021-04-30 18:13:16,wallstreetbets,"I have more shares in gme in fidelity, so it literally doesnt matter what robinhood does. I'm happy to leave my shares where they are"
2021-04-30 17:38:49,wallstreetbets,I voted thru RH
2021-04-30 18:18:53,wallstreetbets,"I was told because of auto journaling I don't own my shares and I can't vote them.

Turns out robinhood was actually good to me and fidelity screwed me over.

At least now auto journaling is off, but the whole everyone transfer to fidelity thing stinks more than a cow patty"
2021-04-30 18:08:39,wallstreetbets,"Ah right, it‚Äôs some conspiracy, because you know for a fact nobody is selling.

You guys are beyond just pretending to be retarded."
2021-04-30 15:06:16,wallstreetbets,way
2021-04-30 15:49:53,wallstreetbets,Only
2021-04-30 16:42:15,wallstreetbets,I have a friend in Bulgaria. He says it's okay. Definitely better than Robinhood though.
2021-04-30 17:27:58,wallstreetbets,There are other options
2021-04-30 15:56:00,wallstreetbets,the way

2021-04-30 19:33:17,wallstreetbets,Why RH
2021-04-30 19:39:38,wallstreetbets,Complete lie...

2021-04-30 19:19:21,wallstreetbets,Have you tried using thinkorswim? It‚Äôs a TD Ameritrade app.
2021-04-30 19:45:39,wallstreetbets,I like the app. The website can go to hell. It doesn't even update in real time.
2021-04-30 17:51:10,wallstreetbets,"Had not considered that, but now that you mention, I bet most of my holdings were partial. Once again, I‚Äôm proven to be a retard. Thanks! I‚Äôve been dumping it all in GME now anyway, haha"
2021-04-30 18:55:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I learned a long time ago, when I'm poor, everything costs more :(So far, I'm buying long (2-3 months out) and sell/rebuy them. For now, making $1,000-$2,000 /week extra on top of my regular job is a big help too. I'll leave for a better platform when I build up some capital."
2021-04-30 18:53:54,wallstreetbets,Ok but what about the 2.5 annual margin rates
2021-04-30 16:32:29,wallstreetbets,I am well aware of what they restricted. Restricting buying entices more people to sell because price will inevitably go down when people can‚Äôt buy. They essentially forced people to sell in my eyes. They cannot be trusted. Especially with the amount of capital this particular ape has chosen to put into GME.
2021-04-30 16:13:30,wallstreetbets,HEY LET THE RETARDS ENJOY OUR LOGIC. LET THE CASINO üé∞ GAMES BEGIN
2021-04-30 18:32:36,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not a conspiracy theory if it‚Äôs true.

2021-04-30 17:11:11,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for this, tits are jacked even more now."
2021-04-30 19:18:50,wallstreetbets,"I also switched to TDA. I like the thinkorswim app. I might have to check out fidelity when they put out their new app, though."

2021-04-30 14:36:01,wallstreetbets,Its been priced in for a while now homie
2021-04-30 16:41:34,wallstreetbets,You will be converted accordingly. You will have the same call.
2021-04-30 16:40:50,wallstreetbets,You have a rapists wit.
2021-04-30 13:35:45,wallstreetbets,Famous last words before APHA TLRY dip.
2021-04-30 15:38:14,wallstreetbets,I needed cash this week to pay for a fence I'm having installed so I sold my crlbf and gtbif and now they're doing really well and I'm stuck with these apha bags. It burns. Can't wait to unload the apha and go all in on US companies.
2021-04-30 15:58:15,wallstreetbets,Dispensaries aren‚Äôt the only way.
2021-04-30 16:04:19,wallstreetbets,"$MSOS has been on a rampage this week, relatively speaking."
2021-04-30 14:07:19,wallstreetbets,Yes - they should convert to the appropriate ratio after closing. Look here under all stock  merger [https://pocketsense.com/happens-stock-options-one-company-bought-another-6005.html](https://pocketsense.com/happens-stock-options-one-company-bought-another-6005.html)
2021-04-30 13:47:21,wallstreetbets,"When the merger closes (likely next week and we may not know the exact day till the stocks are halted pre-market) each of your APHA shares will turn into 0.8381 shares of TLRY. So if you own 10,000 APHA you‚Äôll get 8,381 TLRY... note that there are NO fractional shares however so if you have 100 APHA = 838.1 TLRY they‚Äôll round down and you‚Äôll get 838 TLRY (always rounding down even if you get .99 something)"
2021-04-30 13:47:24,wallstreetbets,"For each APHA share you get .8381 Tilray. Should be pretty even, dollar-wise."
2021-04-30 15:11:14,wallstreetbets,"I think having an America-centric outlook on canna is going to make folks miss out. Glad the aph/til has a strong global focus and I suspect the US market will be very chopped up between growers. All due respect to places like California and Washington, but the world knows the British Columbia reputation for quality first. Sweetwater is going introduce Americans to Broken Coast, which is the company that made me invest in Aphria in the first place. Too many financial squares with no real understanding of the industry. Consumers, both medical and rec will catch on soon and demand quality. Crazy it is dropping today but I am used to the ridicousness at this point and will be patiently sitting on my shares."
2021-04-30 13:04:22,wallstreetbets,Jerry
2021-04-30 15:42:24,wallstreetbets,You want a real 420 play? Go all in on Auxly. Ticker XLY
2021-04-30 15:25:42,wallstreetbets,"Dude this shit was priced in like over a month ago.

I voted and sold my shares, and even that was at a loss, I‚Äôd be hurting even more if I didn‚Äôt get out when I did, I should have sold earlier but stuck around to vote."
2021-04-30 19:04:26,wallstreetbets,"They now have Sweetwater, it's not a dispensary but it will be a way to get there CBD infused beverages into the market"
2021-04-30 14:07:47,wallstreetbets,"Note this is APHA options, TLRY options should stay as is"
2021-04-30 15:04:44,wallstreetbets,so we can still get into aphira today? and be good for merger?
2021-04-30 15:05:51,wallstreetbets,Right now it look like you actually lose with APHA
2021-04-30 13:56:15,wallstreetbets,Jasmin
2021-04-30 15:48:58,wallstreetbets,I have enough weed plays going.
2021-04-30 15:13:21,wallstreetbets,It doesn't matter which one you get in - theres no reason to buy APHA over TLRY at this point. They're priced the exact same.
2021-04-30 15:34:16,wallstreetbets,Can you not do simple math?
2021-04-30 19:18:32,wallstreetbets,And sndl was not one of them lol
2021-04-30 15:36:07,wallstreetbets,The exact same....meaning the price TLRY is currently trading at?
2021-04-30 15:40:14,wallstreetbets,"Right now you lose 
Aphria is 15.23
Til ray is 18.23
18.23 x .83 = 15.13
You lose on APHA"
2021-04-30 19:54:04,wallstreetbets,No thank god.
2021-04-30 15:40:50,wallstreetbets,Well if you buy 100 APHA you are getting 83 TLRY and the APHA price right now equals 0.8381 TLRY so both stocks are trading at the same price. You either buy APHA and get TLRY when the merger closes or buy TLRY and keep TLRY - they‚Äôre the same stock at this point!
2021-04-30 16:05:02,wallstreetbets,believe it or not 0.83 is not equal to 0.8381
2021-04-30 16:01:03,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been watching it for a while, crazy how right on target it has stayed."
2021-04-30 17:26:04,wallstreetbets,Ok you make a few cents then
2021-04-30 16:20:28,wallstreetbets,There was a massive spread a few months ago. The reason it stays in check now is because there are massive hedge funds that trade merger Arb and keep the spread in check
2021-04-30 19:55:52,wallstreetbets,Yeah I made that play on Apha hoping it would hold
2021-04-30 12:45:14,wallstreetbets,And posted the loss porn like a man. Amen.
2021-04-30 14:13:46,wallstreetbets,Can you link the DD? I would like to test in hindsight if i would have jumped on the stock.
2021-04-30 12:46:31,wallstreetbets,you saw a wsb post and didn't inverse it?

2021-04-30 12:51:00,wallstreetbets,"Rule #1 since January. Inverse the good Dd, look for the posts that surpass the 1.2b market cap but still get taken down because mods(who I believe work for CNBC) cant front run the shares. If you want a stock to go down to present a better price, post it on Reddit."
2021-04-30 13:48:17,wallstreetbets,Was it this guy [https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:comedian213](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:comedian213)?

2021-04-30 14:48:32,wallstreetbets,"I would recommend next time to sell puts on the stock at a 30% discount to share price instead, you earn the premium which is usually pretty good after WSB posts about it, and use the free premium money to buy shares of that stock. It's a low risk way to capture potential upside while mitigating downside"

2021-04-30 13:40:41,wallstreetbets,"If there is anything i have learned all dd being made here is kinda bs. Just wait 1-2 weeks and then buy.

I got a job offer from Sunpower back in 2018 but ultimately chose to work with a car company instead. Always looked up to them when I worked in the solar industry many years ago. They're not as dominant as before but it's a good company. Low P/E and I still like them. Doubled down today but fucking shit. Industry folk call it the ""solarcoaster"" for a reason. It's the future but fair valuations... hell if I know anymore."

That's because a lot of people have figured out that there are millions of people on this sub who are easy pickings for a P&D. All you need is a semi readable DD.

Of course, if you know something is a P&D, you can always inverse the ""DD"". But chances are you'll get fucked that way too cuz it's all about timing. And if I've learnt anything on this sub, it's that most people here are absolutely shit at timing the market."

Also several insiders increased their holdings this week, most likely in anticipation of a good earnings report to be released on the 5th of May.

2021-04-30 19:03:51,wallstreetbets,">I‚Äôm sorry for my ignorant question, but you sound quite knowledgeable, what does inverse the DD mean?

Do the opposite of whatever sentiment the DD is trying to push. For example, if you read all the MVIS hype posts, and bought a weekly put for it on Monday that expired today you'd have made decent money off of it. 

The trouble with this strategy is timing the market. None of us know the future so there's every chance you could have chosen the wrong expiry date. For instance imagine you'd bought puts earlier this month that expired on the 23rd. You'd have lost so much money. Whereas a call bought at the same time with the exact same expiration would have printed.

Basically, if you see a stock getting randomly hyped here, stay away especially if you're the type to not do your own research into something before investing.

Or if you have the money to spare, and feel like gambling, you could try and inverse the DD and and hope your timing with your options works out."

2021-04-30 17:53:52,wallstreetbets,Depends what price they shorted at.  If they shorted at 392 (the peak) they're doing pretty--if they did it at 20 they've been eviscerated Assyrian-style.

2021-04-30 17:33:41,wallstreetbets,Lol you even leveraged it. It‚Äôs up more in the aftermarket then in the regular session
2021-04-30 17:35:58,wallstreetbets,So you have around 40k now?
2021-04-30 13:29:03,wallstreetbets,Is there a site that tracks these things?
2021-04-30 14:15:46,wallstreetbets,Some people consider ethylbenzene with the BTX group. I do but about 99% of people don‚Äôt know what it is
2021-04-30 16:07:33,wallstreetbets,"I enjoyed that dip ;)

Is there a DD on this one anywhere?"
2021-04-30 12:56:58,wallstreetbets,Good! My thoughts were correct. Thanks for confirm
2021-04-30 12:57:38,wallstreetbets,This is always the sentiment after a huge disappointment. Good luck holding those heavy ass bags bro. But by this comment it seems like you don't even own shares lol
2021-04-30 18:43:13,wallstreetbets,"Was expected. The tech is why folks are investing. It was never meant to be a meme stock...should check out their actual sub, pretty great DD‚Äôs for a long play."
2021-04-30 18:26:39,wallstreetbets,Nope didn't sell them yet. What is shorts?
2021-04-30 12:38:20,wallstreetbets,Haha ok not everything is a short squeeze who would have thought bout that
2021-04-30 12:38:01,wallstreetbets,So this is not shorts covering? Why the fee is so high?
2021-04-30 12:27:08,wallstreetbets,"Idk, think shorts didnt even start covering yet. No big spikes"

2021-04-30 15:57:04,wallstreetbets,"The point is Silver is a commodity currently at 1970 prices.

Base Metals hitting ATHs means producers will do anything they can to increase supply.

2021-04-30 12:28:09,wallstreetbets,"The full DD has been done primarily by u/thehappyhawaiian, but the TLDR is that the price of silver is mostly determined by futures trades on 1000 oz bars, and that market is much thinner and tighter than most people realize. The confluence of inflation, increased industrial demand, increased investment demand, and significant short positions will drive silver prices much higher this year."

What are the uses of helium that will drive up the price?"
2021-04-30 13:57:33,wallstreetbets,"The degree to which SLV is a scam is sort of nuanced, I have concluded:

Does buying SLV, at current prices, cause any real silver to be purchased? Almost certainly not. This is why people call it a scam.

Does SLV's arbitrage mechanism mean that SLV will track the spot price of silver? Yes. If even one authorized dealer uses the arbitrage mechanism to make money for themselves, SLV will track the paper price of silver. All the participants involved are strongly incentivized to do this because they make tons of money doing it.

If enough SLV is bought, will real silver prices go up because of it? This is in many ways the biggest question. Given what we saw in February, my hypothesis is that when SLV purchases outpace the amount of silver that the participants have in reserve by a lot, they do in fact go purchase some form of silver, possibly all paper. But this still drives the spot price up, as the spot price tracks the paper price. 

I'm not a silver bug or much of a believer in hyperinflation. My goal is to make a ton of money. If I think the price of silver will go up, calls on SLV are low enough IV right now that the rewards are huge if this plays out. I've taken that bet."

2021-04-30 19:07:59,wallstreetbets,"TLDR; MRI, Super conduction, Semiconductor Chip Production, Welding, Rocket Launching, Science Research, Stupid Balloons.  All uses projected to escalate faster than general economic growth.  Reserve supply bleeding out this year.  Production limited with commercial mining specifically for Helium just starting.  Known sources still cover less than 30 years projected demand.  Can‚Äôt be recycled.  

Uses:  By all known laws of physics, Helium is the only way to get temperatures under -263 Celsius on Earth.  Superconducting can be done at higher temps for some application temperatures, but extremely efficient superconducting like for the best magnets has to happen very close to absolute zero. Every MRI machines uses Helium as a result.  Modern ones are more efficient with it, but there is always a loss rate with Helium.  Given time, Helium passes through any solid, so its always bleeding off.  Initial fills of new MRI machines take a whole lot.

Like Tin, Semiconductors require Helium in production.  Its inert and flows better than other inert gases to help deal with Thermal issues.  

Spaceships require them for launch.  Those are literally skyrocketing.

Welding uses it heavily, but there are alternatives.  Those alternatives are currently more expensive than Helium.  Most other applications have no alternatives.  

Demand for everything on that list is climbing.  

Supply Issue:  Best Part of the Equation for Helium.  Most supply comes from Natural Gas production - some but far from most Natural Gas mining produces Helium in limited quantities.  Most NG has too little in the mix to capture and separate.  And NG production is projected to peak and drop by 2030 when supply is already limited.

There was a big reserve the US had from decades of NG production when Helium use was limited.  That is all but sold off.  So the number one supplier in the world for most of history just exited the market. 

Like most elemental commodities, there are a handful of places that have it.

DMEHF (Canadian company mining in Arizona) has the highest known concentration and it is coming online for production.  

RHCCF borders a field in Canada with a private company that is already producing commercially.  Lower concentration than DMEHF but probably bigger formation than DME and RHC has massive amount of acreage.  Comes online for production likely this year. 

HLOGF is in Tanzania and is on the largest known Helium formation in the world and may rival or exceed the concentration of DMEHF.  Helium formation well documented but they are still placing test wells."

2021-04-30 16:05:44,wallstreetbets,I literally despise Intuit. The company does not care about their customers. They have in large part a captive customer base and they treat them like captives. They don't do a thing to advance their software unless they are responding to a competitive threat. Not surprising their payroll system crashed. Probably still in the back running on 30 year old software that they are too lazy to update because why spend  the money when your customers won't leave you for lack off easy alternatives to switch to.

2021-04-30 16:22:23,wallstreetbets,"To tell you what kind of company Intuit is: If you store QuickBooks files on a server you have to have QB installed on that server. In the end it's not a terrible expense, but they make a ton of money from people buying a license for a copy of QB that is never used. Also, their support is horrible. I took a certification course through them, and they changed QuickBooks Online so that the course materials, book, and assignments did not match. Fuck Intuit.

2021-04-30 14:09:42,wallstreetbets,"It's not tracking the S&P specifically.  It's tracking monetary expansion; just happens that S&P, commodities, real estate, art, etc are as well.  However, if we continue to melt up and fiscal stim creates systemic inflation, equities will eventually be affected.  Look at any equity market in a county experiencing inflation spiral - incredible first couple years as denominator is debased, eventual collapse as effects finally hit the real economy and flow into supply chains and biz models are impaired.

If we go the other way and things unwind, the initial crash will provoke a flight to safety as always (usually the strongest currency aka dollars aka last March).  And then I agree, the longer term picture is less clear.  If this is the big one and things need to be rebuilt from the ground up like Dalio, Burry etc believe, you know what my bet is for the base asset.  We'll see."

2021-04-30 12:57:01,wallstreetbets,"Not sure you‚Äôre understanding this. If it were easy to just create a traditional vaccine just like Bharat‚Äôs vaccine, they would have done so. 

US competitors might be able to scale faster, but definitely at a significant cost. I think the play on this vaccine is buying for storage and reselling to other countries in need. 

I fundamentally agree with you, in that I doubt a large portion of the US population will be vaccinated by Ocugen‚Äôs vaccine, but I do see a large potential of reselling the vaccine and keeping a significant portion in storage in case we have another rainy day."

Even when they get approved there won‚Äôt been a demand for their doses until at least 2022.

The only way their doses are needed is if their vaccine is BETTER than the three already contracted for. There isn‚Äôt strong enough evidence yet that is the case. More clinical analysis needed.

That being said, them simply getting approved will likely make the market move upward even if the govt doesn‚Äôt actually buy any doses."

2021-04-30 16:54:45,wallstreetbets,There is a growing anti covid vaccine sentiment in the US. I don't think we'll get above 60% vaccinated any time soon.

2021-04-30 11:57:58,wallstreetbets,"That's because they get manufactured here in America by partnering with American companies, but are developed and created in India. If you've ever gotten a vaccine here in the US chances are it was created and developed in India."

2021-04-30 13:13:09,wallstreetbets,"1) the costs you‚Äôre talking about were not incurred by the companies. They were injected  with monies by governments. Scaling isn‚Äôt an issue when you have money from existing other products on the market and a network of manufacturers
2) how exactly does it make sense to you that OCGN will sell to the US to stockpile who will in turn sell it to other countries? Those countries can buy direct from Bharat. Unless OCGN has exclusivity to sell in other countries, the other countries have no incentive to take the US stockpile unless it‚Äôs given for free. They could deal directly with Bharat. So the theory that the US will stockpile Covaxin vaccine falls flat on its face"
2021-04-30 12:52:51,wallstreetbets,"Pfizer has enough in the pipeline and money from dick medicine to jizz all over OCGN that their profit sharing wouldn‚Äôt even dent their quarter. Whereas OCGN has 0 products in the market and 3(?) studies that haven‚Äôt even entered trials. 

Fucking amatuer, gtfo"
2021-04-30 12:08:38,wallstreetbets,"Covaxin has been proven effective against all variants in the last P3 interim report so I definitely think there's going to be a higher demand once people who got anything but covaxin get re-infected. The trials also included children below the age of 18, so this may be used for the very young population of the USA aswell."
2021-04-30 12:10:39,wallstreetbets,"Biden has come out to say he wants to stockpile vaccines and resell to countries in need.

I‚Äôm fairly confident that we overstock the flu vaccine as well and that has an abysmal rate of compliance compared to the COVID vaccine."
2021-04-30 19:34:55,wallstreetbets,Haven‚Äôt had a vaccine in over 30 years. I think I‚Äôll pass.
2021-04-30 12:14:26,wallstreetbets,The only buyer of COVID-19 vaccines in the US is currently the US Government. It would also be ridiculous for India to export vaccines to the US when these doses are still desperately needed within India and elsewhere in the world.AstraZeneca still not approved in America because it‚Äôs made in India.
2021-04-30 12:42:31,wallstreetbets,Ocugen's transformation into a COVID vaccine stock it's absurdist theatre. Don‚Äôt fall for this trap ü™§ without researching this company. It will be worth $1-2 by summer guaranteed.
2021-04-30 13:35:09,wallstreetbets,"1) I see your point, but you have to also think about cost vs benefit. Why would the government pay out of pocket for a US company to begin to start the process of copying the Ocugen vaccine. Scaling is indeed not an issue. It‚Äôs a cost benefit analysis. There‚Äôs a reason why Moderna and Pfizer are only in the vaccine game with mRNA variants. That‚Äôs what their focus is. To do a complete 180 and switch to a traditional vaccine would cost them and the government far more than buying vaccines from an already proven company.

2) The same reason why Biden bought and stockpiled AstraZeneca vaccines, which he is now sending out to India for support. Some countries don‚Äôt have the capital or the desire to pay for the large quantities of vaccines necessary to establish immunity and get our world returning to normal. The USA has both internal and external interests, wether they be financially or morally speaking, to return the world to normal. It‚Äôs evidenced in what‚Äôs occurred in the past and what‚Äôs going on right now."
2021-04-30 12:09:28,wallstreetbets,This is an entirely possible scenario.
2021-04-30 12:12:26,wallstreetbets,"This is also entirely possible for driving demand.

Also for full transparency, I have 30 of Ocugen. Not a ton but enough to ride a wave if it happens."
2021-04-30 12:35:17,wallstreetbets,"They arent exporting the vaccine lol. They are providing the recipe for the vaccine so that OCGN can manufacture it here in the US and distribute accordingly. Also COVAXIN can be manufactured at  the cost of a bottle of water. It can be stored in much more manageable temperatures which also helps cut cost for transportation / and last longer in terms of storage / shelf life. The US is under pressure to help India and other countries. Biden stock piling IMO would be a smart move too for alliances with other countries and ‚Äúprovide aid in the form of vaccines‚Äù. Biden also ended up pleding the US‚Äôs entire stockpile of 30M current doses to help India which was reported so all of that so called stock pile would be depleted hence the demand for more. This administration is going to be on full throttle pressure due to the elections and will take every step to ensure they try and stay ahead of any vaccine shortages (again IMO). This will be used politically either way you look at it (again IMO). The ‚Äúmaster file‚Äù for EUA was submitted weeks ago and they were waiting on P3 results which came out last week if I am correct (and were very very good) which was the reason for the huge jump in price. Also, there were 10M shares which were sold to institutional investor @ $10 which also gives it a good value, institutional money sees great value in OCGN (again IMO). Not financial advise but I love the upside to this stock."

2021-04-30 13:51:26,wallstreetbets,"1) at this point it‚Äôs not necessarily copying Covaxin. Because the circulated vaccines in the US are Moderna and Pfizer and now have staying power, despite mRNA, they‚Äôre more trusted than say JJ and Astra. By default if they come out and say you either need boosters or a final traditional vaccine, people here would go out and get it. Whereas Bharat has some shoddy trials in January that makes the FDA hesitant to approve it, despite the efficacy. If Bharat‚Äôs vaccine was the only one, sure, the FDA would approve. But it‚Äôs not and there are two functioning vaccines that need to be tweaked, I wouldn‚Äôt bet against the federal spending more money than it needs to, especially with big pharma‚Äôs lobby power. 
2) Astra‚Äôs vaccine has never been approved by the FDA and so the federal government is sitting on this stockpile incurring costs. Why sit on this vaccine when you can show your ‚Äúsoft power‚Äù? It‚Äôs a no brainer. Same thing if the FDA took away JJ‚Äôs approval. The federal government would get rid of its excess stock that it can‚Äôt use"

* When short interest stays high, the SP plateaus (also the case in the last half year). When a short squeeze happens this of course brakes the pattern.
* PE ratio has cratered, this is a serious thing (NVDA is over double AMD for the moment)
* Revenue is increasing at serious speeds.

2021-04-30 16:47:22,wallstreetbets,Debt growth is not necessarily bad if it is dedicated to investments or new production processes.  And even more so considering the context of low interest rates.
2021-04-30 14:01:51,wallstreetbets,Unlike Intel AMD does not own there own fab. AMD out sources The production of there silicon to TSMC. So as TSMC is running at 100% they have to allocate dedicated time for each company they supply. Unlike how they did run in 2019 where at aprox. 70% they were running multiple lines at once. But come 2020 the sand and water shortage showed up.  This limited the production capabilities greatly but now that Taiwan is in the rainy season and supply chains are becoming stronger the production will start to open up later this year.
2021-04-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$SWI - Easiest money rest of 2021 Will keep this short to hold your attention but for the extra special people, see the TLDR below.

SWI got the shit hacked out of it. This was revealed in December with the US government featured on the white couch with five massive Russians behind it. This led to a near 40% drop in the stock with 5 eye (think NSA if your brain is smooth) orders to immediately shut down all SolarWinds Orion software in the government. The hackers were so good, the virus was imbedded in the software, and customers paid major $$$ to have it installed in their networks. The malware was so sticky, SolarWinds automatically included it in all development and code updates.

So sounds like a piece of shit company that should tank right?

Wrong. Nobody gives a shit. Let's take a quick looks at some history:

* Target 2013 Holiday Season - Largest cyber attack on a retailer. 70 million customers affected. 11% drop following the announcement in December. By end of February, highest percentage stock price regain in five years.
* Home Depot - Fall 2014 - 65 million customer card accounts. Slight drop following the announcement. 21% increase in earning per share third quarter 2014.

Companies with shitty cyber security and software development practices only pay short term penalties. Long term, they're too big to fail and the customers pay the price. Market will forget they suck and everyone will be back to the pre hack narrative by the summer.

What do we do about it? Buy shares motherfuckers. Calls drive the price down and and allow the big boys to manipulate us. That being said, I bought me some calls and pushed back with equal value in shares.

To throw some other stats in here. SWI is a solid company. \~$5 Billion market cap, \~1 Billion in revenue a year, \~15.5% Profit Margin, 95% of shares held by institutions and insiders with \~10% of the float shorted. They have 300,000 customers, including nearly all Fortune 500 companies and numerous federal agencies.

**TLDR:** Short term, all your BANG-P stocks have basically peaked. They have nothing going for them short term besides the fact you'd do anything but work a real job to leave your mom house. Buy shares and equal $ positions in calls. **SWI up 25% by August** üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Positions:  
SWI 11/19 30C \~5k  
SWI Shares \~5k"

A better example would be Equifax. While Equifax isn't a cybersecurity company neither, data privacy *is* an important/critical feature of their business.

This is a big if but if it gets to that then you'll know you are somewhere near the ceiling. If the patent sale is over 1B then I think it's going to help a lot. If it's something like 2B then hold onto your shorts. To reach the 10x though the revenue is going to have to start growing significantly for institutions to start dumping money in, which will be approximately when everyone you know is talking about buying an EV that isn't a Tesla, or you see them all over the road."

For the unaware, EDR (Endeavor Holdings) just got a majority stake in the UFC yesterday. This is the first time the UFC is being publicly traded. This is a ridiculous opportunity because the UFC is still relatively new. 

MMA was the only sport that ran flawlessly throughout the pandemic, and the ufc is already selling out stadiums at full capacity as of last weekend for UFC 261. Every year they break their previous records for PPV buys, and that trend will continue as the UFC continues to expand internationally. Dana White has gone on record stating that the UFC will set up a card in Africa in 2022 to try drawing talent from that area. Imagine more Ngannous and Kamaru Usmans!!!

Oh... and Elon Musk has the midas touch, so having him on the board is sure to boost value just by his presence alone.

2021-04-30 11:13:11,wallstreetbets,"See... in the same comment where you are claiming we cant always have a new generation of popular fighters, you named a popular fighter from the newest gen.

In all sports, the next generation breaks the records of the previous generation. We will always have an up-and-coming talent. We may not always be able to guess who will become popular, but there will always be a popular fighter. We also have more weight classes and more countries involved than ever before, and the roster will only continue to grow. Im not sure how long you have followed the UFC, but we didn‚Äôt always have a fight card every Saturday.

What we see today will be dwarfed by what we will see tomorrow. Its always been that way in all sports."

We may not even see another GSP, Silva type 1m + ppv buys. Jones doesn't sell as well anymore (800-900k ppv buys down to the 600k range), Conor is losing it, Khabib is gone (he sold very well in the Middle East)."

2021-04-30 11:26:32,wallstreetbets,"Well I must respectfully disagree with you. Theres no way I can see Mcgregor being the only fighter that can generate buys. There will always be new talent.

Lets see what ppv buys look like for 2021. Also this stock went up $2.25 since we started this."
2021-04-30 11:32:38,wallstreetbets,"Disagree with what? Israel has not sold well, and has controversy. You can look up the ppv ##. Look at China. They went 0-4 the other night and their champ got ktfo. Foreign markets are streaky and need talent influx, but even sports like Judo pay better than mma let alone boxing.

Look, my main point is that this stock could be jumpy. What happens when someone dies in the cage? Or the pretty girl loses an eye on ESPN? Or Jones pisses hot? 

The UFC can absolutely make stars, and the stock could do very well. I'm not sure how much of WME is the UFC, but if it's a large chunk then the stock is not good for value. 


C'mon man, if you're an actual fan you know how streaky and volatile the UFC is. That could very well extend to the stock too."
2021-04-30 16:59:56,wallstreetbets,"I think you bring up valid points, but I think sports in general are ballooning in value. I think the UFC will follow suite but is just further behind because its been a more fringe sport. But I think that is changing.

2021-04-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MVIS is bargain of the century right now So let me get this straight. 

Royalties this year are expected to be $3.3 million for 2021 (virtually double the 2020 royalties) thanks to the $22 billion contract between Microsoft and the US army. S2upid smashed up a Hololens to prove MVIS tech was in it and MVIS confirmed it was their part in S2upids video during their meeting May 2020.

We also now have back on the table the rumoured $100million deal with Sharp who have just had a 12 month extension granted to their exclusivity deal for MVIS tech for a display/smart speaker etc.

We then have the value of 484 patents as of last year, which has no doubt increased in number since then.

We also have the disruptive best in class A sample LIDAR produced this month, which beats anything from  anyone else hands down.  A bidding war feels imminent on this, unless a deal has already been agreed privately subject to maybe one more milestone of them testing it themselves first...

And then add on the other products that they are working on. 

I‚Äôm amazed this hasn‚Äôt gone higher in share price! It definitely feels like it will be a 3 figure stock for the buy out. 

It just shows how much power the hedge funds have when they short, to drag the price down so low. I thought they might have learned a lesson from GME but clearly not!"
2021-04-30 10:07:51,wallstreetbets,Bruh the market cap is still over $2b after the drop and you are talking about $3.3m in royalties.
2021-04-30 11:50:25,wallstreetbets,"Bought around 10$ a few days ago. Sold yesterday at $18.00.

2021-04-30 10:05:39,wallstreetbets,Fancy math there. Do you think 3.3 in royalties is good? How about research cost? Operations? all the things are accounted for.

2021-04-30 10:09:09,wallstreetbets,"After reading the balance sheet Im not so sure I want to support MVIS anymore. Their revenue this quarter is only 500k dollars. I have a relative who is not that rich and his company has 4 times that revenue.

And the whole bringing forward of earnings date and releasing product info seems so scheming. Their revenue for the first quarter is 3 times lower for last Years first quarter. Usually bringing forward earnings date signifies good news but in this case, I feel its only to artificially inflate the assets portion of the balance sheet."
2021-04-30 10:15:04,wallstreetbets,I would have taken the risk if I would have known about the rally when it was way down but at 14 a share is too much for the small amount of money I have

2021-04-30 10:48:36,wallstreetbets,"79M in cash, total expenses for the quarter 6.9M. It will be a few years before they run out of money. 
It seems like the narrative needs to switch from never-ending R&D to an aggressive marketing/sales effort. Scientists tend to stay in their comfort zone. In this case, the scientists in charge of MVIS need get out of the lab and get on the street. If they are incapable of selling their product they need to find someone who can."
2021-04-30 12:19:14,wallstreetbets,I was in before the rally as a long term play but what's with the mvis hate? They are going to have a buy out. Most of this is implied value.

I think he could had given a better answer without breaking NDA.

I sold it with the assumption that there is no pipeline of customers who want to see the demo. 

I could be wrong....just went with my instincts."
2021-04-30 10:14:39,wallstreetbets,"The numbers are kinda underwhelming but I was holding months before the WSB hype, a buyout does seem imminent honestly. My PT is $63 a share, I see no reason why the company can't fetch a $10B buyout given all the verticals and everyday usage that their tech has. The MVIS sub has some excellent info!"
2021-04-30 10:26:57,wallstreetbets,"MVIS bargain? LOL. I don't know who you're trying to fool, but I wouldn't call this a bargain. Until they find a major buyer on the lidar tech, this is nothing more than a WSB meme play that got overextended like it always has. A more fair price given how far away a ""potential"" sale of their lidar is probably around $8-$10 a share. The current royalties really don't justify the current market cap."

So then I go look at the market cap and see it is $2.3 billion and I reread the first sentence and see that you are getting excited about $3.3 MILLION (yes MILLIONS!) in royalties, which is 1/697 of the market cap... Yeah, you are a special level of insane."

2021-04-30 15:56:13,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs funny to read people‚Äôs perspectives on this stock right after they make or lose money. Owning at 4 or 24 is obviously a big difference. Neither price should change your long term outlook on the company. Age old classic battle between what is a good company and what makes a good stock. A good stock makes you money. A good company should make money. Not every good public company is worth owning as a stock. Plenty of not so good public companies that are worth owning as a stock. It‚Äôs always a mad task of finding the balance. The meme investing and wsb crowd doesn‚Äôt help much with figuring it out.

2021-04-30 19:53:49,wallstreetbets,Garbage company!  If you made on the run up collect and move on!
2021-04-30 10:06:44,wallstreetbets,"I need a little help apes. I just started this week. How to I reinvest my returns on Etrade and Robinhood, without selling? üôèüèº Please and thank you"
2021-04-30 11:28:32,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs only a bargain if they happen to be the first massively used LiDAR in consumer automotive.  Otherwise it‚Äôs just another LiDAR company competing in the space.  Time will tell though.  If your cost basis is under $1, you made a trade that outperformed most the world‚Äôs best asset managers.  $1-5 cost basis, you‚Äôre doing amazing for the year, keep it up.  $5-10, got in before WSB P‚ÄôN D, I see - good luck with your decision.  $10-higher, you look for any opportunity to exit without a loss or dollar cost average down if you‚Äôre a true believer.  That‚Äôs my 2 cents - I sat this out and watched a couple friends get burnt...shoulda bought GME instead!!"
2021-04-30 10:17:38,wallstreetbets,MVIS TO $20 üöÄ
2021-04-30 11:20:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes, if you wanna average down and bounce out."
2021-04-30 11:20:08,wallstreetbets,I am close to getting back to even on this right now but also feel like as soon as I jump something is gonna happen to swing it back.
2021-04-30 14:27:22,wallstreetbets,$14.50 is the new top to sell... or buy!
2021-04-30 11:26:40,wallstreetbets,"2 month old account pushing a post peak meme stock as a gme alternative.

you should write for motely fool, just ask your boss kenneth for an internal referral? Oh and go fuck yourself!"
2021-04-30 10:14:56,wallstreetbets,LETS GET THIS SQUEEZE
2021-04-30 10:54:28,wallstreetbets,Just went 50% in on 5/21 calls
2021-04-30 12:12:01,wallstreetbets,1 year late.
2021-04-30 15:17:25,wallstreetbets,"I bought in this morning to watch the gap fill, then will pull out. I will reenter sub $10 for long hold. Good tech, but years away from big moves and likely to be shorted to nothing for a while again."
2021-04-30 17:42:26,wallstreetbets,Someone needs to do a full ape educational series about market cap and it‚Äôs proportion to stock price or the loss porn will keep coming
2021-04-30 10:18:50,wallstreetbets,My thoughts exactly .... not really a bargain
2021-04-30 11:51:42,wallstreetbets,what is 8.16B market cap LAZR's revenue?
2021-04-30 16:02:43,wallstreetbets,oh yah it's not a bargain yet. Lets wait till next week. Immma going to get in at  7 dollars.
2021-04-30 13:34:34,wallstreetbets,my avg is about $11 and I sold 1/3rd of my shares at $26.  no regrets whatsoever. And at this rate I might even be able to buy them back at 11  lol
2021-04-30 11:31:01,wallstreetbets,Would‚Äôve been so much better if he had triggered that automod response that‚Äôs about to reply to me
2021-04-30 10:22:38,wallstreetbets,"I am not in the slightest holding any bags, I am up a lot at the moment, but not taking any profits as I am holding until buy out, I just struggle with why others didn‚Äôt do the same I guess"
2021-04-30 11:28:19,wallstreetbets,"""Forget GME and bag hold this pump and dump instead"""
2021-04-30 12:12:14,wallstreetbets,"To his benefit, he didn't specify which century it was a bargain in."
2021-04-30 12:55:17,wallstreetbets,Tbf a week and a half ago there was no A-Sample which adds value and increases likelihood of a buyout.
2021-04-30 12:17:16,wallstreetbets,"Whoa
Whoa
Whoa horsey 
They had 479,000 in 1st quarter revenue!  Yes that is with a Thhhh....!!! And only had 6.2 million in expenses!! T clearly comes after M in the alphabet and million has WAY more zeros that thousand and zero is nothing so that means this is clearly worth buying!  Do the simple math. It isn't hard. Well, im waiting for oral sex behind a Wendy's dumpster so it is hard but barely. 

I'm open for another BJ after lunch to if you buy me a frosty"
2021-04-30 10:26:48,wallstreetbets,"What research cost? MVIS spent $4m on research and development in the quarter . . . VLDR spent $50m, but MVIS has the best Lidar just trust."
2021-04-30 14:01:17,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm a bag holder and I‚Äôm proud
2021-04-30 11:13:39,wallstreetbets,"Not me. I am up, I bought in earlier in April, whilst the price was down, I feel for those who bought it this week before it crashed though."
2021-04-30 19:08:37,wallstreetbets,"Hell no, I am a shorter and I am proud! ü§£"
2021-04-30 18:56:11,wallstreetbets,I'd rather hold a bag of shit on fire than buy MVIS
2021-04-30 11:13:42,wallstreetbets,"Them reporting quarterly *revenue* that makes up 0.2% of their current market cap (let alone their market cap before this massive crash) isn‚Äôt doing it for you?

Just as an example for a company that famously trades ahead of its fundamentals...

If TSLA had an equivalent revenue/market cap ratio they‚Äôd be worth 5 trillion right now, roughly $5,200/share"
2021-04-30 13:29:02,wallstreetbets,MVIS is back on track to the way it was before the retards in this sub aimlessly flocked to a stock that they know nothing about lol
2021-04-30 10:13:30,wallstreetbets,I hope that plug gets pulled soon
2021-04-30 11:00:03,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-04-30 11:12:19,wallstreetbets,"If I could buy any more, it would mean I am averaging up!! I do want to add some over the next month though when I am able to."
2021-04-30 10:15:12,wallstreetbets,And besides the said relatives company only has a valuation of 20 million while Mvis has a market cap of over 2 billion. 500k in revenue is a joke.
2021-04-30 10:19:09,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs a nice point though never looked at it this way, I sold with a dollar profit on 50 shares at market open."
2021-04-30 11:41:59,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, i own a restaurant in the middle of nowhere with 5 employees that does 1/4 of thier revenue. This is like gambling on a single applebees to beat stocks and go to the moon. 

I bought in at 18, and held until earnings hoping for good news, and maybe a partnership or something, but i paperhanded the second i saw the earnings. Got out at 17.44 and happy i got that much."
2021-04-30 19:09:15,wallstreetbets,"So true, it feels like a scam to me."
2021-04-30 11:54:03,wallstreetbets,% gains don't care how much you got.
2021-04-30 10:10:10,wallstreetbets,"Not at all, I bought before it went up, am up nicely, albeit not as much as I was at the start of the week and I am holding until the buy out happens."
2021-04-30 11:02:08,wallstreetbets,They mentioned in the call last night that they are hiring a marketing person
2021-04-30 11:11:33,wallstreetbets,"Agree, smart people aren‚Äôt good sales people. They need a slightly more approachable, relatable, with good car salesman charisma. Like an Elon Musk type."
2021-04-30 10:15:57,wallstreetbets,"There is details on the MVIS group on Reddit, Sharp are named in a document"
2021-04-30 19:23:01,wallstreetbets,Nope.
2021-04-30 11:04:19,wallstreetbets,"I think there are people lined up, and he is swimming in NDA‚Äôs. You could hear a laugh in his voice when someone actually named Microsoft and Google/Ford as potential buyers, and he then talked hypothetically about OEM 1 and OEM 2"
2021-04-30 10:17:51,wallstreetbets,"Me too, I bought before it went up recently and got the impression $60 was the low ball figure and many are hoping for $100 or more. Hence I have no interest in selling at $31 like it reached on Monday"
2021-04-30 10:19:06,wallstreetbets,Yeah it was really eye opening seeing what this sub is like now. Lots of good DD and a predictable dump after earnings but I constantly saw FUD from normal people because it didn‚Äôt play exactly how they thought it would
2021-04-30 11:59:13,wallstreetbets,They literally have no product
2021-04-30 19:16:04,wallstreetbets,Good luck with that. lol.
2021-04-30 11:13:42,wallstreetbets,"Hah bag of shit is a P&D, explosive diarrhea is the way."
2021-04-30 19:14:24,wallstreetbets,That company is a total scam lol.
2021-04-30 12:13:42,wallstreetbets,No one said the buy out should be this week though. Optimistically the next couple of months perhaps but not before the sample was finished and not before they have seen it demonstrated and been able to test it themselves...
2021-04-30 11:20:14,wallstreetbets,"Me neither. My gut is we won‚Äôt have too long to wait before there is an announcement. Might be cutting it fine to pull it together before the shareholders meeting at the end of May, guess time will tell soon enough!"
2021-04-30 10:08:07,wallstreetbets,I hold shares bought before WSB made it mental. I‚Äôm still nicely in profit. I‚Äôm just struggling to get why it has been targeted when they are on the cusp of selling.
2021-04-30 10:11:50,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a worthless corporate husk.  You‚Äôre about to lose your shirt.
2021-04-30 15:26:27,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs excited about what their ip is worth in a buyout or sold off as individual verticals.
2021-04-30 10:58:18,wallstreetbets,I read it on the MVIS group. Shows a screenshot of it
2021-04-30 10:28:14,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs more the level I thought it would sit at until a buy out is allowed to be announced. I will make 6 figures from this when they sell, and quite happy holding as long as it takes (and I don‚Äôt think it will be that long a wait)."
2021-04-30 19:20:57,wallstreetbets,yes before its too late.
2021-04-30 17:15:06,wallstreetbets,"I did the same thing a month back w/ fomo afterhours news. Personally i awaited the next hype train to better reposition, & it worked out, Ive actually done this 3 times w/ MVIS in 2 mnths. You have to decide yourself. Best I can tell you is dont follow hype w/out major experience. Instead go in w/ a plan w/ multiple realistic goals based off charts & DD, set a sell order immediately based on goals(sell ‚Öì at 25%, ‚Öì at 50% etc.), then set target alerts to monitor major spikes & if need be adjust orders otf. Panic is the devil, just like fooseball.

To be clear I am far from a stock professional, this is not financial advice, but rather is a jackass service announcement & this call is being recorded for Tin Foil hat purposes, please hang up & try again, and if at 1st you don't succeed cut your losses, oh & Id like to talk w/ you about one last chance to renew your auto insurance....."
2021-04-30 11:45:08,wallstreetbets,"Personally I would hold and if you can afford to average down then do that. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done on a few wrong timed buys I‚Äôve done in the past. I‚Äôve not gone crazy and put everything into this like some have, but I have put more in than I‚Äôve ever put into one stock before. I‚Äôve read the DD, and this one has really got under my skin. I‚Äôm convinced this will pay off."
2021-04-30 10:16:06,wallstreetbets,"Step 1: get away from Robinhood  
Step 2: ask the helpdesk of whatever other broker that isn't Robinhood"
2021-04-30 11:32:48,wallstreetbets,"I have average cost of $12.08, before WSB drove it up, but I‚Äôm not selling. Yes I‚Äôm in profit but I‚Äôm not after a few dollars a share when I‚Äôm convinced it will have a much higher value at buy out."
2021-04-30 10:23:10,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm hoping for $60-100
2021-04-30 11:21:10,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt need to average down, I bought in earlier in the month before it went up, I‚Äôm fortunate in the timing that I‚Äôm still up"
2021-04-30 11:21:37,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt risk selling ever
2021-04-30 11:30:00,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not a meme stock and there is no need to talk like that to me. I am a normal investor, and I‚Äôm holding it for the buy out. I didn‚Äôt know about this Reddit world until GameStop happened, that‚Äôs why I joined as there was useful information on it at the time in this group"
2021-04-30 10:23:58,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not a squeeze. It‚Äôs a chance to buy shares and consensus is gain 4x as a minimum at buy out
2021-04-30 11:01:31,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt do calls, I‚Äôm in the U.K., just shares and a spread bet"
2021-04-30 17:52:11,wallstreetbets,The loss porn will continue regardless.
2021-04-30 10:25:44,wallstreetbets,Apes like to spend 2.2 Billion to get 3.3 Million

2021-04-30 10:43:25,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted.. everything you said is true. MVIS was $10 2 weeks ago and <$1 not even a year ago. This mentality that every ticker is a pnd is garbage. Anyone who has done any DD on MVIS knows that there is huge potential in the near future. 

Me personally? I bought puts for earnings. After lidar announcement on Wednesday I knew earnings would be a bloodbath. But I used that to buy more shares. And I took profits through the run up. If people were actually smart about their plays they wouldn‚Äôt be trashing you bro"

2021-04-30 12:22:54,wallstreetbets,Good bot!!
2021-04-30 19:11:25,wallstreetbets,"Still no a-sample as far as we know since there was no demonstration of how it works, and it won't be operational ever. 
It's only taken this company 25 years to lose $600M on $500K in revenue last q. Pathetic joke of a stonk."
2021-04-30 10:39:09,wallstreetbets,Best doesn‚Äôt matter when good enough works.  If you product meets spec it comes down to cost.
2021-04-30 12:25:43,wallstreetbets,Well technically aren‚Äôt they.. because of the stock split
2021-04-30 13:55:52,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-04-30 16:58:00,wallstreetbets,Now do tesla!
2021-04-30 19:09:49,wallstreetbets,Imagine Microsoft actually do announce they do a buyout ... for 20m ü§£ü§£ü§£
2021-04-30 10:37:41,wallstreetbets,"I also bought when it was 12 dollars and sold when it was 25. But speaking from an ethical standpoint, I wouldn‚Äôt support them."
2021-04-30 12:13:45,wallstreetbets,Unless he has $13
2021-04-30 10:11:51,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs no proof of any buy happening you should have sold
2021-04-30 13:47:49,wallstreetbets,Wait they didn't have one before?
2021-04-30 14:04:52,wallstreetbets,Hiring A marketing person lol.. wow
2021-04-30 19:22:16,wallstreetbets,Fake fake fake.
2021-04-30 11:07:57,wallstreetbets,"I agree this is NDA and he said we should not speculate but in my opinion telling we have 10 customers or 10 OEM in pipeline who want to see the demo is not breaking the NDA ....

He said ""i believe our technology is the best""...when he can say this then in order to quantify what he was saying....he should had said we have x number of demo's lined up for x number of OEM's."
2021-04-30 10:37:10,wallstreetbets,"According to a past comment your cost basis is a few cents below $14, but you‚Äôre ‚Äúnot interested in selling at $31‚Äù?

This is absolutely wild to me.

You‚Äôre passing up an opportunity for 100%+ gains for an Internet forum driven pipe dream"
2021-04-30 10:40:47,wallstreetbets,Nearly 40 percent drop day of earnings will put FUD in anybody
2021-04-30 10:29:36,wallstreetbets,"This has been rumored to be bought out, usually by Microsoft due to relative location, and relation in HoloLens since 2015 prolly sooner. It's not gonna happen, MVIS is extremely overvalued, they gained 3+ years as a company due to raising capital in 2020 and honestly none of it was deserved.."
2021-04-30 10:39:43,wallstreetbets,Husk is a fun word
2021-04-30 10:17:41,wallstreetbets,What's another app I can use?
2021-04-30 12:19:34,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs still so bad about RH? I‚Äôm a smoothed brained invested on that app so if I should get away pls lmk why ?!
2021-04-30 19:23:10,wallstreetbets,Ok
2021-04-30 11:43:41,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs not bad, and if you got in for the potential of a buyout I would hold and let your thesis play out.  If it works, you‚Äôll be just fine. If it doesn‚Äôt then oh well, it was a great try.  The really good thing I see is that the owners aren‚Äôt selling their shares, which tells me they really believe in the company.  The exposure WSB gave the stock might also put pressure on the owners to perform at even higher levels.  It‚Äôs a risk, sure, but if you continue to add below your cost basis and nothing really bad happens fundamentally to the company (someone beats them to the punch, technical setbacks, manufacturing setbacks, or higher degrees of dilution that prior years) then you should be fine!  Best of luck to you!"
2021-04-30 10:52:58,wallstreetbets,When?
2021-04-30 10:29:44,wallstreetbets,60-100c more like.
2021-04-30 11:25:31,wallstreetbets,I wish I'd done that instead of boarding the hype train.
2021-04-30 11:12:56,wallstreetbets,Nice. I only lose money so it's dumb of me but every now and then I'll hit big and get roped back in *sigh*
2021-04-30 10:59:16,wallstreetbets,I just want an honest week's pay for an honest days work
2021-04-30 12:06:26,wallstreetbets,Good bot
2021-04-30 12:20:29,wallstreetbets,Bro they missed their quarter by 100%!!!! They literally have a 2 billion dollars market cap and they are worth like 1/20th of that
2021-04-30 11:15:13,wallstreetbets,Future potential doesn't warrant an almost 100% increase before earnings. Someone definitely made money off of MVIS this past week and it wasn't retail.
2021-04-30 12:30:27,wallstreetbets,Lul
2021-04-30 13:02:01,wallstreetbets,My 17p printed. Cost basis of $1.75 and now it's at $4
2021-04-30 10:53:08,wallstreetbets,"I doubt MVIS has anything close to a working a product after hearing their call yesterday. They ""no comment""ed on their path to market, number of paying customers, valuation . . . ."
2021-04-30 12:27:35,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not how that works
2021-04-30 19:58:05,wallstreetbets,MSFT would have overpaid at $20M.
2021-04-30 10:40:21,wallstreetbets,My average was 13.77 and I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôm away from that stress just bought some $TWTR they have been literally hammered after disappointing results
2021-04-30 12:26:36,wallstreetbets,"lol. touche, Boss."
2021-04-30 10:19:41,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs because if there was proof it would already be priced in? Damn the comments in this post are stupid
2021-04-30 14:04:24,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-04-30 11:10:57,wallstreetbets,"True, that would have helped to give an idea on what the future holds. The more that throw their hat in the ring, the higher the buy out price could be."
2021-04-30 10:39:14,wallstreetbets,And correct. I have out of hours access and could have sold when it touched $31 earlier this week but I‚Äôm happy holding for the end goal
2021-04-30 10:38:33,wallstreetbets,My average cost is $12.08 so I‚Äôm currently up 28%. Plus have a spreadbet that is also up by 4 figures.
2021-04-30 12:26:39,wallstreetbets,I passed an opportunity for 200% gains and I'm still holding because the end goal is the buyout not a WSB hype surge. I started investing in MVIS about 5 months ago and am still up 70% overall so I don't feel too bad about it. That being said I don't mind waiting another year for this stock anyway especially considering it will be better for tax purposes anyway.
2021-04-30 10:51:04,wallstreetbets,"I agree but I was seeing it before then, and if you read the DD you understand why it dumped after. 

Some people seem to need a boogeyman to blame when that‚Äôs just how the market goes"
2021-04-30 12:34:49,wallstreetbets,Well to be fair HoloLens still is in the early phases of adoption and so is LIDAR tech. Even if a buyout doesn't happen at the very least HoloLens is going to take off in the next few years which will net some nice royalties for MVIS. I can think of tons of potential applications of HoloLens in my workplace alone and I've seen a handful of them being tested. I imagine that lots of employers are currently evaluating it and might start buying in the next few years especially considering the Army is interested and a lot of tech gets adopted by the military first before it goes mainstream.
2021-04-30 10:20:11,wallstreetbets,TD Ameritrade isn't bad
2021-04-30 10:26:21,wallstreetbets,WeBull. It's free and there aren't any transaction fees
2021-04-30 11:48:30,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I‚Äôm not convinced I will get the opportunity to average down at this point. It seems to be holding well at the moment around the $15 mark. Don‚Äôt have more money for nearly 4 weeks anyhow!"
2021-04-30 10:53:56,wallstreetbets,At the buy out
2021-04-30 11:27:40,wallstreetbets,"I was just lucky on my timing, I mistimed a few others this year, like Editas..."
2021-04-30 11:15:22,wallstreetbets,"I think our spread bets are about as similar as you can get, but not quite as risky as your options. I‚Äôm up a couple of thousand on that but keeping it as went in it at a low price and believe this will get an offer before too long"
2021-04-30 12:17:52,wallstreetbets,"I want to skip this part and go to the part where I buy Lambo, maybe pit stop to tell boss to fuck himself."
2021-04-30 15:29:44,wallstreetbets,"This will be my personal mantra, but unironically"
2021-04-30 11:37:51,wallstreetbets,"I mean....I did...and I'm retail....but I never really looked at it as a long term play...otherwise, agreed."
2021-04-30 14:28:52,wallstreetbets,"Timing it is hard.  I thought the peak was at 23, and didn‚Äôt happen"
2021-04-30 11:26:24,wallstreetbets,Lol hilarious replies from Sharma. EVERYONE GO READ THE TRANSCRIPT.
2021-04-30 13:19:30,wallstreetbets,Sorry missed the sarcasm!
2021-04-30 12:28:26,wallstreetbets,It was sarcastic rhetoric
2021-04-30 10:44:34,wallstreetbets,Its my second week of trading actually and I‚Äôve already learnt a lot from this saga. I can absolutely relate to the stress you are talking about haha.
2021-04-30 12:09:19,wallstreetbets,That is because WSB isn't about long term plays it is about making a quick buck. MVIS will be bought eventually but because it wasn't announced this week everyone is acting like the sky is falling and it is a trash company.
2021-04-30 11:13:15,wallstreetbets,Tbh i felt it was a pitch for future buyers in the earnings call.
2021-04-30 11:14:38,wallstreetbets,31 was the end goal
2021-04-30 15:47:59,wallstreetbets,"Same, and I‚Äôm up 700% at the moment. I‚Äôm rolling the dice on this one."
2021-04-30 19:17:07,wallstreetbets,"there is no buyout, that's a blatant lie ... the CEO had no idea what buyout everyone was talking about when asked on the CC ..."
2021-04-30 11:09:45,wallstreetbets,Big fud immediately after 2nd peak and a sample release. I knew it would be sell the news and even an earnings beat would still have a sell off. But I held like a dingdong
2021-04-30 19:23:00,wallstreetbets,Thank you
2021-04-30 19:36:35,wallstreetbets,"Hi guys !  I entered at 19 and left at 26 for having forgotten the tp on.  Today I see it at 14.85 and I said to myself: to hell with it.  Within with 10,000 pieces!  I'm with you !!!"
2021-04-30 11:12:57,wallstreetbets,When is that?
2021-04-30 11:19:17,wallstreetbets,Good shit man best of luck to you
2021-04-30 11:27:21,wallstreetbets,Seriously . . . it was comedy.
2021-04-30 15:16:30,wallstreetbets,Lies
2021-04-30 12:45:04,wallstreetbets,"From what I can tell, if you jump in early enough, when you say ‚Äúit‚Äôs up 200% and going to the moon‚Äù it‚Äôs *sell time*.  I knew $28 was *sell time*, but I got greedy."
2021-04-30 15:20:42,wallstreetbets,The cycle repeats itself
2021-04-30 11:16:18,wallstreetbets,"I think they know who their future buyers could be, but they need one of them to make their move. Or it will go to a rival."
2021-04-30 11:16:44,wallstreetbets,"Not my end goal. Yours maybe, but not mine"
2021-04-30 11:13:12,wallstreetbets,"You didn‚Äôt do enough reading, people were bullish about earnings because of the A sample news and potential for some kind of news about a buyout or other partnerships, the earnings themselves weren‚Äôt really relevant. 

Don‚Äôt feel bad I held calls over earnings and closed my puts to avoid IV crush, but still would have had another 200$ if I had held them"
2021-04-30 11:18:32,wallstreetbets,"Personally I reckon it won‚Äôt be long. I haven‚Äôt seen the LIDAR in action like MVIS have, but if it‚Äôs everything they say it is, and if I was a company interested in buying them, I wouldn‚Äôt hang around too long and risk someone beating me to it"
2021-04-30 11:17:04,wallstreetbets,In 16 years
2021-04-30 11:22:45,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I have complete faith in this. I think I‚Äôm lucky that our spread bets are ongoing, it‚Äôs not down to what a price is on a set date all or nothing type scenario."
2021-04-30 11:37:45,wallstreetbets,I had to stop driving I cackled so hard and loud. Plus I pre came at the prospect of my 5/21 Puts

2021-04-30 11:31:07,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for assuming that but I did read and was aware of the single paragraph of info you provided me. I‚Äôm commenting on the market in general, how even great earnings reports and calls were still met with sell offs recently. I also knew the earnings would be buy out or bust. So absent the home run, MVIS was destined to tank"
2021-04-30 11:48:05,wallstreetbets,"I saw the 100s of pattents and other good things, but I also read that their tech is 10 years behind. Was this wrong?"
2021-04-30 11:50:37,wallstreetbets,"But I‚Äôm down 50% and I‚Äôm afraid to hold any longer, so should I just sell or should I hold?"
2021-04-30 11:41:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I've been short since $23, looking to exit at $12 . . . will probably meet some resistance and bounce on Monday/Tuesday off the 100 DMA."
2021-04-30 14:21:46,wallstreetbets,Definitely more fun than checking my Tesla stock once a week.

Post below copied from ST. **I can confirm it!** Completely overseen the **change in wording**. In the past they were only in discussions and so on. **Last status** before PR only **weeks ago** was ""exploring"".

Some weeks ago in March in the Q4 PR it was:

&#x200B;

I would add in addition to Chris, it changed during the few weeks also from

>**alternatives**

to **now**

>**partners**

&#x200B;

Chris pointed also out that it is **plural**, so that there are > 1 possible parties interested in buying at the share price level at the time of the CC, so at > $20.

Buyout was never sooner and likelier than now, Closing likely soon.

Wait until you are down 90% in a few weeks."
2021-04-30 19:53:50,wallstreetbets,"Mvis I never felt was a good play, regardless of hype. Too many better players in the lidar segment.. in no way am I saying it's garbage but I've done alot of dd into lidar. It's like a tick on the back of an ü¶ç"

2021-04-30 11:07:16,wallstreetbets,Uh we like money not stock. You entered after most people had already sold. You should have taken your 100% profits.
2021-04-30 12:26:39,wallstreetbets,You should regret not selling when you were up 100k because if you sold there you could have many more shares now that the price is lower.

2021-04-30 13:08:04,wallstreetbets,WSB will say yea but I think MVIS is a much safer long term option if you‚Äôre not just looking to make a quick buck
2021-04-30 10:54:21,wallstreetbets,"This is what people always say, rather than accepting the reality that people just sell and make profits.  The market is not a team sport.  When mvis was 20, everybody was claiming that people should get in now cause its going to 100.  People get caught up drinking their own kool-aid.  If anything, id say the noobs are the ones who stayed in and didn't take profits because they got greedy and dont understand how the market works."
2021-04-30 10:01:46,wallstreetbets,"How do you know it will go back up? I get the feeling I should have sold when it got to double what a paid per share, but I'm relatively new to all this."

2021-04-30 11:37:13,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not sure. I bought in at 8.50 (600 shares). Didn‚Äôt sell a single one, even when I was on 7k profit (a rookie mistake). I‚Äôm still up like 30% but I don‚Äôt think it will drop to below 9 so no point selling and buying back in at a higher price. But what do I know. I‚Äôm just hoping ive not messed up haha"
2021-04-30 12:29:24,wallstreetbets,It always was.  Sorry to say that that party is over.  No institution will touch it I‚Äôm afraid.  Holding CLOV at $10.15 and GME at 157 myself.
2021-04-30 17:39:52,wallstreetbets,Yah i got news.  You made others rich.
2021-04-30 14:16:06,wallstreetbets,I have put credit spreads at $15/16 so if it's just like $16.01 on expiry that's good enough for me lol
2021-04-30 10:49:47,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip
2021-04-30 14:32:13,wallstreetbets,Depending on when they bought the MVIS they also might have missed on near 20% gains.  To me not cashing out at +20% and then bagholding down to those losses would be so crushing.
2021-04-30 12:55:57,wallstreetbets,Saw that coming. BUY GME!!
2021-04-30 15:52:15,wallstreetbets,Those are rookie numbers.
2021-04-30 14:00:19,wallstreetbets,"Couldn't find it, bought more MVIS instead."
2021-04-30 17:29:15,wallstreetbets,Is that for options or you talking about buy shares?
2021-04-30 12:12:51,wallstreetbets,By the time it‚Äôs ‚Äúmooning‚Äù it‚Äôs probably time to buy puts on the stock.

2021-04-30 19:13:32,wallstreetbets,LOL well played. Go $mvis
2021-04-30 11:11:59,wallstreetbets,"I entered months ago kiddo :) But nah, I'm good."
2021-04-30 12:59:18,wallstreetbets,"That is called hindsight. You see all those ""Ifs"" and 'weres"" in your statement? You're looking backwards. 

In that moment you have no idea if the ride is going to continue, or if you should get off. There are people out there who sold GME at 4$ to lock in that sweet 100% gain. 

 I am a long holder with a specific exit point. The event that signals my exit hasn't occurred, so these fluctuations - while fun to look at - don't hit my expectations."
2021-04-30 12:42:47,wallstreetbets,Wow.  Great insight there captain hindsight.   Really impressive
2021-04-30 14:25:07,wallstreetbets,Is that even a question ??? FUCK YEAH .
2021-04-30 11:36:05,wallstreetbets,"I'm in, but I'm also wary of anything Chamath is in, anymore."
2021-04-30 13:04:23,wallstreetbets,"I did it for 40, thinking I'd hold it only through the  earnings call, now I'm looking at it saying I'd rather hold it to zero than take the 80% loss it is"
2021-04-30 11:57:16,wallstreetbets,Yep. My know it all nephew refused to sell when i tol him its over. Im like dude u dont hold memes that go up that hard that fast. You take your money
2021-04-30 12:58:43,wallstreetbets,I think it depends on when and why you jumped in. The people who bought in at 20+ looking for a quick buck and didn't exit before earnings fucked up. Unless the earnings call was going to announce that the company was sold they were going to lose money. On the other hand if you got in at $10 or below because you believed in the company then didn't sell (like I didn't) then obviously you still fucked up because you could have sold high and re-entered low but personally I'm not too worried about it since I was always in it for the long haul anyway.
2021-04-30 14:45:47,wallstreetbets,"This right here, so many people are thinking it's a team sport since GME, maybe even before that.

Most people will take their gains and get the hell out of dodge. And then probably open a new position an hour later and lose all their gains and then some lmao I speak from experience."
2021-04-30 14:14:42,wallstreetbets,"I was up 20%, tried to exit, spent an hour trying to get a fill on my options. Fuck robinhood. I lowered my price until it was only 10% profit and I was 30 minutes late for work, said fuck this I'll do it later. Later never came, now I'm at max loss, which is only like $80 because premiums were so high. But yeah. 

Fuck robinhood and their garbage fills."
2021-04-30 10:17:39,wallstreetbets,"\~22/24 was the time to sell MVIS.  You'll be looking at a long-hold for better payout again, which should occur...but will be a long hold I think."
2021-04-30 10:04:07,wallstreetbets,Next time set stop limits. The stocks here on WSB often do this. They have a huge run up and that crash hard when people take profits. Setting a stoo limit can keep you from being a bag holder
2021-04-30 11:57:34,wallstreetbets,Yes u should have
2021-04-30 12:54:18,wallstreetbets,Noobs to the stock not noobs to trading. My bad!
2021-04-30 12:28:00,wallstreetbets,At one point it was well under $1 so it has plenty of room to fall. Their financials are a joke and no one is buying them out. So this is looking like a real long shot. For $1 a share why not take the risk. At $8 a share? Forget it.
2021-04-30 14:41:42,wallstreetbets,"Howdy, heard you been talking bout me friend."
2021-04-30 14:42:39,wallstreetbets,Heh that‚Äôs me on AI. Cost basis of 110. Watched it go to 160 and back down to the 60s.
2021-04-30 17:05:46,wallstreetbets,"20%? Try 60% at the height.

And that‚Äôs getting in night before the run up from $17."
2021-04-30 13:53:09,wallstreetbets,Haha yeah that‚Äôll really complete the holy trinity of garbage
2021-04-30 14:47:50,wallstreetbets,Have you tried buying $CUM ?
2021-04-30 13:30:37,wallstreetbets,I love how gaining $10 - $20 is ‚Äúmooning‚Äù to everyone on this sub now
2021-04-30 11:13:26,wallstreetbets,You literally just implied that 14.95 was your entry.
2021-04-30 15:25:17,wallstreetbets,Ncshooter426.... we need to talk!! I like your style! üëèüèºüöÄ
2021-04-30 13:04:24,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. In those situations with a stock that I'm long term bullish on but I know is likely to drop I usually cash out some but keep some for upside. Or cash out all but buy a few calls so I can gain if the price jumps soon after I sell.
2021-04-30 12:46:21,wallstreetbets,He's the one who said he didn't regret not selling (and buying back more shares after it tanked)...
2021-04-30 14:08:52,wallstreetbets,"You belong here brother. This is not the way, but you absolutely belong here."
2021-04-30 12:06:46,wallstreetbets,Me still holding 500 shares of GME.
2021-04-30 10:35:38,wallstreetbets,"This is a lesson I had to learn with mvis this week. I caught the first ride on monday and tuesday sold, got greedy on wednesday and brought back in when i saw the dip and am now bag holding at 20 all because I fell asleep thursday afternoon BEFORE earnings without setting a stop loss."
2021-04-30 11:23:43,wallstreetbets,"I rode this shit really well last week, exceptional gains, but yesterday bought 3 week FDs thinking this is the bottom. -70% in one day FML"
2021-04-30 10:36:42,wallstreetbets,"If you set a stop limits, it is not the rigth stock for you"
2021-04-30 14:57:19,wallstreetbets,Why am I going to buy it when I'm guzzling that shit thanks to my PTLR and MVIS trades.
2021-04-30 14:11:25,wallstreetbets,It went from 10$ a share to 26$ that‚Äôs what over 150% in less than a month and that‚Äôs not mooning?
2021-04-30 14:05:13,wallstreetbets,"lol, $10-20 is a lot when your whole account is worth sub $40k"
2021-04-30 14:47:18,wallstreetbets,"so if I bought 10,000 shares at 10 (100k$) then it‚Äôa 20 doesn‚Äôt that mean I‚Äôve doubled my fucking money....are you fucking stupid ? Or am I stupid ? Or are we both stupid ?"
2021-04-30 17:15:14,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, stock price is irrelevant, the percentage gains is what matters.

100% is insane. Maybe ""mooning"" can be reserved for the true unicorns that jump 1000% or 10,000%, but you seriously lose credibility when you mention dollar amounts and not percentages."
2021-04-30 11:14:29,wallstreetbets,That was his entry... You know I'm not the OP right?
2021-04-30 11:55:44,wallstreetbets,Reading comprehension is fun

2021-04-30 11:02:37,wallstreetbets,Exactly the same here
2021-04-30 11:23:22,wallstreetbets,"do what I do, when you see a meme stock hit the top of wsb, buy a few puts, they will print almost every time. my mvis puts bought Monday looking pretty good rn"
2021-04-30 10:55:01,wallstreetbets,"I bought 500 at 11.00, 500 more at 26 w/ a stop at 24 because I wasn't sure it was gonna keep momentum.  I made ~8k instead of losing ~8k because I set that stop.  What's the problem with stops?"
2021-04-30 11:44:00,wallstreetbets,you must be new to trading
2021-04-30 14:16:31,wallstreetbets,Fuck no. Do you feel like you are on the moon? Did you retire? 150% is a nice jump for sure but not what I would consider mooning.
2021-04-30 15:12:09,wallstreetbets,"Very good, sir. You are right, that would have doubled your money üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº lots of investments will double your money and it happens often. Mooning is really open for interpretation I guess but it used to be a rare, massive jump before this sub started saying every stock that is mentioned here ‚ÄúIS ABOUT TO MOON‚Äù. If you think MVIS and CLOV just mooned then cool I guess. But doubling your money isn‚Äôt what I call mooning ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2021-04-30 17:24:07,wallstreetbets,I was referencing the gains made by MVIS
2021-04-30 12:09:46,wallstreetbets,"People are shitting on me for ""failing reading comprehension"" but you followed your statement about 14.95 with ""I didn't sell...""

If these were two distinct thoughts you should have added a paragraph break to make it clear that the shares you didn't sell were distinct from the ones not being bagheld.

2021-04-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NrdRage's Friday DD: I promised you a layup, so here you go. It's inevitable, so I for one welcome our new Chinese overlord Chairman XiMao. The company who will sell you everything except freedom and independence. $BABA-Booey So y'all have been asking for an  easy, can't-possibly-fuck-it-up type of trade, especially after the  $ISRG debacle.  I don't usually like writing up about companies with  more than half-trillion dollar market caps, but I'll make an exception  just this once because it doesn't get any easier than this trade,  especially with our newfound policy of kissing China's feet rather than  trying to piss them off.  So let's talk about Alibaba ($BABA)

# Who they are, in case you've been living under a rock

$BABA  is basically the result of if you combined $AMZN, $JPM, $SHOP, $PYPL,  and $GOOG (not $GOOGL, no voting rights in China).  Over 90% of China's  online shopping goes through one of their portals, mostly Taobao on the  consumer side and the flagship Alibaba site for B2B.  Oh, and they've  even started building out their own cloud platform, because China can  never just come up with an idea on their own, they have to copy a  competitor (i.e. Amazon).  If you think Amazon is pervasive, they're  bush league compared to this company.  In short, the only thing bigger  than China's $BABA is deceased WWF pornstar Chyna's clit (still too  soon?).

Anecdotally,  they're also where savvy US consumers go to buy $1500 DJI Phantom 4  drones for like 400 bucks (and no, they're not knockoffs).

&#x200B;

# Peering over the Great Wall:

&#x200B;

Their over 600 billion dollar market  cap makes them the 7th largest company on the exchange, just behind  $TSLA and just above Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger.  Unlike the  company just ahead of them, they actually make money, though.  They do  about 72 billion dollars in revenue annually and, when they're not  pissing off the communist party and being handed down massive fines as  an alternative to their founder being disappeared to go hang out with  the Uyghurs in a slave camp making textiles, they pocket about 12  billion of that 72 as net revenue.  They make their money by selling ad  space to merchants as opposed to $AMZN's method of ""taking 1/3 of all  the money you make for giving you a buy button on the site"" and, as  recently as 2019, had grand designs about moving in to the US space and  taking on $AMZN head-on with a merchant agreement of a one-time  admission fee in exchange for commission free commerce.  I could write  an entire thesis just on their various revenue streams.  Everything from  ecommerce to a search engine to their own fucking (**DUMB FILTER ALERT:**  automod doesn't like the 4 letter word for a place you go to deposit your money and get checks so we'll call them) tanking ecosystem  (which they unsuccessfully tried to spin off into its own entity last  year, thoroughly pissing off Winnie the Pooh and momentarily distracting  him from peaceably seizing Hong Kong by killing all the citizens there.

Interestingly,  as a result of their mini argument with the technocommunist leadership  over a failed attempt to IPO the Ant Financial Group, which $BABA owns  1/3 of, $BABA represents one of the few large cap stocks you can trade  in the US that isn't presently sitting near an all-time high (20% off,  in fact), as people - including myself - avoided the company while  waiting to see what China was going to do with them.  Then others have  been apprehensive to jump back into because, apparently, it's more fun  to lose all your money betting on a shitty Chamath scam that rips off  Medicare or a LIDAR company down 97% from its ATH and who makes less  gross revenue in a quarter than I paid for my last car (tragically, I'm  not even joking).

As  a result of this depressed price action, $BABA represents something of a  unique animal on Wall Street:  An ultra cap growth stock that is also  technically a value stock.  Just don't tell them they're a unique animal  or else the citizenry will storm their headquarters looking to kill  everyone and eat them because they think it'll bring them luck or make  their dicks bigger.  I usually stay away from this statistic, but for  once it's actually worthwhile to mention:  They only trade at 26 times  forward earnings.  In case you were wondering, $AMZN is more than 3  times that.

&#x200B;

# So what's their problem?

&#x200B;

 

I've already said:  It's China as a  whole.  All Chinese companies trade at a discount in America for a  number of reasons.  The primary reason is because you can never tell if a  company is actually being honest about its books, its revenues, or if  it's even a company.  For example, longtime followers will know that I  have maintained for quite some time that I'm not positive that the  company ""Same Ole Shit"" is even a real company.  Why?  Because there's  no oversight.  Also, there's no shorting over there, so everybody gets  away with making shit up.  One of the largest companies on their  exchange was found to be 2 guys in a van that parked behind a  hand-pulled noodle shop and who's sum assets were 2 laptops and some web  development software.  This is why, in general, I don't fuck with any  Chinese stocks and only make exceptions for $BABA, $BIDU, and $NIO (and  I'd do $YUMC if not for the fact I ignore that whole sector).   But  mostly, it's because if the regulators across the pond took aim at $BABA  once, there's always a chance they could do it again if Jack Ma forgets  his place.  The 2.8 billion dollar fine they got handed down sounds  really heavy, but it was really a best case scenario for this company.   Had that fine been handed down during any other time than now when the  market is in hard mode, $BABA likely would already be sitting in the  280's right now.

# So how does the Tendieman come?

Expected  47% YOY growth, with strong forward guidance going in to 2022.  Also,  now that President Harris is making nice nice simping for China again,  as soon as we re-open, expect them to start the process of moving in to  the US market, which will both simultaneously decimate Amazon's 3rd  party network while bolstering $BABA's own.  Oh, and they're encroaching  upon Lazada's turf throughout the rest of SE Asia, as well.

But  there's a catch:  Because Jack had to go to a re-education camp for a  few months and the company was forced to lay low waiting for Poohbear to  finish throwing his temper tantrum, there's still a bit of a fog into  the company right now that is not likely to be cleared up until they  report their next earnings late May.   Don't worry, I have it on good  authority that $BABA's network of merchants has been able to secure a  reliable supply of child labor to continue making all the goods they  sell.

&#x200B;

#  Some basic TravelCenters of America just because (even though it's not terribly important for the thesis)

So  this one is going to look a little different than what I usually put  up, cause I figure some of you are ready for some more advanced  concepts.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pz1r53hj9bw61.jpg?width=1388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=631e23902505c2d7cf90f7e03e806067307c08f1

As  always, nude line is a 200 day SMA, dark blue is a 50 day SMA, and cyan  is a 20 day EMA.  Red lines represent the wedge that's important for  all of you for the purposes of understanding that it's approaching a  breakout point that is almost 100% to the upside, green represents some  channels that we'll talk about some other time, and the lavender is a  bastard fib fan of strike points based on the action (typically you use  those in a slightly different manner, but that's for another day and  another time.  I'm going to start gradually adding Travelcenters of  America markers in an effort to grow your little minds a bit.  So  consider this a level up.

&#x200B;

TL:DR:  Look in the red wedge.  We're  coming up to a head in that pattern, and it will be right around the  time they report earnings.  Look at all the other pretty colors and see  if a wrinkle doesn't develop.

One other thing we can look at is price to fair value.  This is a Morningstar chart, I didn't make it myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/igrlkysl9bw61.jpg?width=918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3350b76b9dbc752c0f24d6e410df5f14291dab98

&#x200B;

So there are a couple of things I  want to call out here.  One is, obviously, the fact that this stock is  wildly undervalued according to every reasonable metric.  The other one  is a term that I want you guys to start learning called ***""Economic Moat""***.   The smoothbrain definition of that is basically a company's ability to  lie, cheat, sabotage, or buy out any competition in order to ensure  that they maintain a competitive advantage, no matter what.  Wide moats  are good but rather rare.  Obviously, if you read the ""who are these  people"" section, you know that $BABA has perhaps the widest moat of any  company on earth, because not only are they alone, but the barrier of  entry to challenge them is enormous.  Just ask their main competition,  $JD, who takes 1 step forward and 8 steps back every time they try.

# So, to summarize:

* Absolute  monster of a company 20% off its highs because of a combination of  government interference, continued concern over regulatory fuckery, and  the fact that nobody trusts the books of a Chinese company
* Over 90% of their market is penetrated, and they have aggressive expansion plans abroad
* Presently at a value level ***today*** as a result of them still being fairly fresh out of their hand slap for the shit they pulled
* I expect some DJI drones sent to my PO box after you make tendies on this
* Reports  late May; is very much a 2nd half of the year play - don't expect a ton  of movement in May up until earnings.  But volatility is already low.

# Price Targets:

For  once, I actually agree with pretty much every analyst out there.  This  company should be in the 320-330 range, and I think as we enter the 2nd  half of the year, you'll see a strong climb toward that.

&#x200B;

#  How do you play it?

**LEAPS ONLY!**  If you look at the daily chart, it had a bit of a pop after they got  fined, but has been largely flat money lately as nobody has wanted to  exit out of their positions due to it being undervalued, but not a lot  of demand to get IN to the position due to the overall market conditions  as a whole.  July at the earliest, August if you have the powder to pay  the extra premium.  If you look back up at my chart, I've gone with a  peanut butter spread strategy with this one, buying calls at $260, $270,  $280, and $310 (now do those lines make sense?) one month apart from  one another starting in August and running through November, along with  some existing June 18 240's just because I felt like it.

Remember,  it's perfectly fine to let this one sit a bit before entering into a  position, but your cost basis will be roughly the same, regardless.  At  the time of this writing, it's sitting at 235.  If you look at the chart  above, there's a real good chance you can creep in some positions after  it hits 230, because at some point I think it will come in to that  number.  However, if it drives to 230 hard, I want you to let it  consolidate and see if you can't get it even lower - maybe even 224 if  you can catch it on a really bloody red day.  But don't fuck around too  much, this isn't a lot of slippage given the equity price.

One  thing people have been asking me periodically is how I would rank the  companies I've talked about thus far on the premise that they don't have  enough powder to be in all the plays and were looking to see if I would  abandon one play for another.  I don't want to encourage that overall  (I don't want to encourage messaging me at all, really), but this once  I'll say that I would definitely not give up my $CLNE or $BE trades for  this one yet, as I don't expect this one to move for a while and those  green plays represent significantly more upside.  I wouldn't give up the  $NVTA trade if I was way underwater on it.  If I wasn't, I might  consider it.  I'd definitely give up cruise ships and plane engines.   Semis in June would be a personal choice.  I'd bail on the Devil's Gold  companies I talk about, I'd bail  on $BB, and the other trades are kind  of dead, anyways.

&#x200B;

#  Position Disclaimers:

Some  of you may have seen me talking about how I'm rebalancing my portfolio  for May and exiting out of all but 15 of my long positions in  preparation to enter into 35 short positions due to market conditions  and timing.  $BABA is one of the 15 stocks I do plan on holding my longs  on.  Liquidity in August has been difficult for me to get, so I'm only  sitting on 200 of those, the September 270 is really where I think the  sweet spot is and I've presently got 1900 of them and will be looking to  expand that, I have 2500 October 280's and the November 310 is a long  term FD that I'm sitting on 700 of.  I also have a significant amount of  shares in the company, but I've had them since their IPO and they are  sitting in managed assets, so not relevant to this trade.

There you have it, kids.  Go forth, and tendie-ize.

All my love

I missed the best CLNE entry point, thinking about entering if/when it touches around 11,13, do you think it might fall even lower? I entered AMD at around 84,02 with a somewhat big position. The market has been pretty red the last 3/4 days, can we expect the bounce back starting next week?

Thanks again!"
2021-04-30 11:03:39,wallstreetbets,"All big businesses in China get to where they are because of one thing - connections with the government. You can never be a heavyweight without their intervention. Jack Ma has forever ruined the trajectory of BABA. They will have a target on their backs now. 

They will no longer have the monopoly they had in e-commerce with TaoBao. They can no longer get major brands to only sell on their platform, so Tao Bao sales will be adversely affected.

Their mobile payment domination in china with ÊîØ‰ªòÂÆù/Alipay is about to take a hit with the launch of the Chinese government digital currency which uses its own app.

They are now more limited in their ability to collect and sell personal data because of new government regulations. 

BABA will forever be Jack Ma‚Äôs company, even if he isn‚Äôt directly in charge. He made a huge mistake criticizing the government, so he and his company will forever pay the price. Politically China has a couple sides vying for power behind the scenes. Jack Ma is aligned with the players who aren‚Äôt in power, so that will also negatively affect him and BABA. Change in china can come quickly and efficiently. Someone with high level government connections can easily create a new BABA type company and they will get the full support of the government."

2021-04-30 19:07:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm a bit confused but let me try to clear something up. 1 contract purchased now ($270C @ $7, Sep exp) means you pay $700 for that contract. The contract will expire in Sept. Before it expires, you have the option to sell at any time, preferably if you're positive. Now if at any time the share price is at or above your strike price (preferably well above 270C) you can then exercise your contract which means you can buy 100 shares AT your strike price of $270 per share ($27k total) and NOT the $700 you paid for the contract.

I'm not sure where you get $2100 from. Also you can set price alerts to notify you if the share price at a specific amount, so you can determine whether you sell your contract.

In most instances people simply sell the contract 1) because the amount to buy 100 shares at the strike price can be crazy high, 2) you still net a positive return if it worked out. Lastly selling a contract is just like selling regular shares. Simply set the limit or at market value and hit sell. 

This is in no way advice, it's minimum info about options contracts."

2021-04-30 11:51:30,wallstreetbets,"One other thing to watch out for is - BABA being delisted from the US exchanges. The Chinese government seems like they can come to a compromise with a joint audit - US approved auditor with a Chinese counterpart. They said though they won‚Äôt allow any audit into anything relating to ‚Äústate secrets‚Äù BABA has a lot of government officials personal and financial data so there is no way the government will allow US auditors to look into BABAs financials. Companies like NIO will be fine with a joint audit since it doesn‚Äôt include government officials‚Äô finances. So if that US law is passed, I think BABA will be delisted. The shares would go over to their HK listing but it would still affect their ability to raise money from the US market."

I'm not saying there's not money to be made. Rather, I'm saying is it right to invest in a company in a Communist country. Especially one who is currently committing genocide on a minority group called the Uighurs. Not the most moral country on human rights.

2021-04-30 19:12:55,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the reply, and sorry about the confusion. The $2,100 was the approximate total to purchase three contracts of $700 each. One in Sept, one in Nov, and one in Dec at the $270, $280, $310 strike price increments mentioned by OP.

I see where options get lucrative: your gains are multiplied by the fact that each contract has 100 units.

But it's all or nothing. 

My question was: for the risk adverse crowd, such as myself, would a better use of the $2,100 it would take to buy 3 contracts be better spent on the actual shares so that it's less gain but also less risk?"
2021-04-30 11:03:53,wallstreetbets,"What time frame? 2m daily?

Edit: I see burst up until about 8:45, consolidate until 9:05 between 10.2 and 10.4 with the ""fat"" of the candles basically not moving, a leg up around 9:08 with less volume than open and more than the previous couple of candles, then bye bye for the next 20 minutes.

Looks like it's consolidating again. If your thoughts yesterday are still similar, we should expect a rocket upwards pinning retail to the dildo that's gonna shaft them soon after."

I would say this is a case where the WSB play also happens to coincide with the folks over at valueinvesting.  $BABA is crazy undervalued right now because of the uncertainty around our relationship with China & China's relationship with $BABA.  I've personally been liquidating things that have already run up above my personal valuations to have about 20% exposure to $BABA in my portfolio, and going to add some LEAPS to the mix."

Sink $2100√ó3 (6300) and if the shares tank, you're bag holding and potentially MUCH more than the cost of 3 contracts. However if it's in a company that isn't crazy volatile, then the purchase of shares outright as a long position may net you more, but that will take time, usually longer than the expiration of a contract."

I have a pretty low risk tolerance due to how often i've been burned on shorter term options where the thesis was right , but the timing was not (+ having no exit strategy \*cough\* TSLA \*cough\*), so I am primarily buying shares & 2022 leaps...but loading up a few 9/17s because of this DD.

I do have some fear that rising rates will crush tech stock valuations near term, but $BABA is so undervalued that I'm hoping it isn't as affected by that.  For reference, my most conservative 5 yr $BABA price target is around $400 assuming a 2% risk free rate (e.g. 10 yr)."

2021-04-30 12:45:56,wallstreetbets,"I work in real estate and know many lenders from several companies and speak to them weekly. Here is some of what one of them had to say when I asked about RKT:

Our sales volume has been insane. Like, everyone has been working overtime for months insane. We can't keep up. I think a lot of people incorrectly assume the home buying trend is going down, but it's the opposite. Same with auto and personal loans.

I think Rocket Companies is going to produce another stellar earnings, because they are #1 mortgage lender in North America, so if we are beating our earnings goals by a mile, they must be doing amazing. Not to mention they do so much more than just home loans.

That said, I think another solid earnings is all we need to prove to the market that this is not a meme stock. This is a dead serious company with a growing monopoly on the North American loan market. People are skeptical because it was erroneously lumped in with GME, AMC, etc.

I am expecting the price to shoot above $30 at a minimum, and I truly believe it will stay there. Period. I'm not gonna sit here and say it's gonna moon and we're all going to get rich. But I think everyone who holds RKT will be pleasantly surprised and happy with earnings.

Again - this is all conjecture comparing to my financial institution work. But my experience strongly points to another great ER, so expect another great run-up with a new baseline of $30/share."

2021-04-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S&P500 returns. Here are the results! **Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it‚Äôs justified, given their clickbait titles or ‚Äú5 can't miss stocks of the century‚Äù or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,

>If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it‚Äôs that Motley Fool is utter trash

Now that that‚Äôs out of the way, let‚Äôs come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool‚Äôs premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X‚Äôed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market. 

Basically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**

**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.

**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.

a. One-Quarter

b. One Year

c. Two Year

d. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)

Another feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday‚Äôs market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).

**Results:**

https://preview.redd.it/oo61ht373bw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c8d785445785475c739f84ea3638bb820420bb2

As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool‚Äôs recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \~2X and two-year returns were \~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&P benchmark.  

https://preview.redd.it/qo4xaop93bw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bf4985e21430a811827242ce9b3587e9a4ae25a

But it‚Äôs not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla‚Äôs 2020 rally.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**

The stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.

**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool‚Äôs premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.

But I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%2527s_Stock_Advisor/fulltext/5a0af7be458515e482743bf9/Evaluating-the-performance-of-the-Motley-Fools-Stock-Advisor.pdf?origin=publication_detail) peer-reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis.

>We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011

**Conclusion:**

I have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it‚Äôs that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.

Whatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.

You know what else greatly outperformed the S&P?  The nasdaq 100, or QQQ.  And that didn't require actively trading a portfolio or a motley fool subscription.   Easy to outperform in bull markets with higher beta"
2021-04-30 09:22:16,wallstreetbets,"You cant really compare different portfolios by just looking at average returns, you need to adjust for (at least) risk exposure and ideally for other factors such as company size/price-to-earnings ratio/momentum.

At the absolute minimum you should be dividing the expected returns by the standard deviation and reporting the Sharpe ratio. Generally, a portfolio of handpicked stocks is likely to have higher expected returns than the S&P500, the question is whether the returns are sufficiently high to compensate for the increased risk/volatility. Its not fair to compare two portfolios that have different volatilities since one could just (eg) buy the S&P using leverage to increase the volatility to match the other portfolio which would hence increase the returns (you can easily construct a portfolio which has double the expected returns of the S&P by just buying the S&P with 2x leverage, which is simple to do using calls/futures/ETFs)

It would also be useful to see how the MF portfolio performed during March-July 2020 when markets collapsed, to see if it was more sensitive to extreme risk than the S&P, which again affects how much leverage could realistically be taken."

This statement gives them more credit, in my eyes, then the ridiculous growth of the last 8-years that are in scope in your breakdown. But beating the benchmarks is beating the benchmarks, especially over so long a period. I'd just hazard a guess that a relatively good amount of blue-chip stock pickers beat SPY over this 8-year bull. 

>But it‚Äôs not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell.

Turns out hindsight is 20/20 and selling just about anything over the last 8-years was more likely to be a bad decision than not. What a ride.

Really great analysis. Thank you for your hard work on this!"
2021-04-30 10:33:22,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm a stock advisor subbed as of recent. A lot of the recommendations I already hear about from their podcasts. Some new ones like Toro for example are interesting to look into. 

I will say their interface is shit I hate this here‚Äôs 10 stocks we recommended now if you want to see any old stuff have fun digging through thousands of articles and half of them are rerecommending the same thing they did already. 

The worst part is all the upselling they do I tried one of their ‚Äúlive‚Äù events they sent me a length to and it was literally not live and them jerking off for 2 hours about how this other more premium service is better then stock advisor and for 5k a year or whatever I could get access to it. 

I like some of their stuff but man do they sure love sniffing their own asses."
2021-04-30 09:51:34,wallstreetbets,"I find that the Motley Fool has an... unintuitive... method for determining the cost basis for their recommendations because it depends on how and when they classify a pick as a ""recommendation."" The cost basis they use to compare their portfolio to the S&P is determined at the date of the official recommendation. The unintuitive part is that the MF will consistently promote those past recommendations via ""Best Buy Now,"" ""Starter Picks,""  and similar articles, none of which are considered ""recommendations"" for the purposes of calculating the returns of their original pick. Most subscribers -- especially new subscribers -- would probably consider these articles to be recommendations and may adjust their portfolios accordingly. 

IMHO, a more accurate return would be calculated by simulating the portfolio obtained by acting on each major article received as a subscriber to one of their services, in order to more fairly represent the returns of a subscriber acting on the information they provide. For most intents and purposes, those articles *are* recommendations from the point of view of a subscriber to their services."

2021-04-30 11:28:04,wallstreetbets,"I just really hated how their recommendations were so expensive or they suggested putting in super large sums. Im just starting out at 26.

I paid for MF a couple of years ago. I bought NBIX at $106 average back in September 2019 and have lost 8%. The other I bought was MKL. They claimed this was supposed to be the next Berkshire in ten years. Since that article I watched it decline from the $1192 I purchased to under $700 at some point points. I'm still running a net loss of 1% on Markel.

Maybe I was unlucky. But I was paying $19 per month for a few months. So probably $100 in subscription to lose money on their suggestions."
2021-04-30 12:24:54,wallstreetbets,Wow very nice analysis! I wonder how Zacks holds up compared to SPY and Moltley Fool with their Zank Rank #1 recommendations!
2021-04-30 13:43:10,wallstreetbets,"I was always annoyed by motley fool's click bait when I first found them and ignored them because of it. I was talking to a co-worker who said I should subscribe and that their subscription is significantly better. He even told me not to subscribe at full price, but to fill all your information and close the page so they send you a promotional email to get it at a significantly discounted price. I did that and in 3 weeks, I was in at $150 for a 2 year subscription.

At first, I was doing additional research because they were recommending all these companies I never heard of. I was still really cautious but was making better returns than my blue chip picks that I was sitting on. I started putting more and more into their picks since I got confidence from my own results going with their picks. 

Since then, I've at least doubled my money on a lot of their picks that I've had for about a year. Fubo is kicking my ass right now but I'm just in for the long hold with them anyway. I've lost on a couple but never anything significant. I'm certainly up way more than I would be if I just put all my money in $SPY. I'm just some bum who long holds stocks but I definitely think it's worth it. Just remember now to pay full price. Put your info in and wait for a promo email where you can get it for a lot cheaper."
2021-04-30 13:50:16,wallstreetbets,My one criticism to your DD is that you're comparing it against SPY. One year with QQQ you're at 70% One year with TQQQ and you're up 250%.
2021-04-30 14:38:26,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't say 8 years is ""enough"" considering we've been in a 10-12 year bull run. Let's see how they perform through a market crash relative to the indicies."
2021-04-30 15:08:02,wallstreetbets,I'm still skeptical. What about their risk adjusted returns? Otherwise I could just argue that TQQQ is better than both SPY and most of the motley fool stock picks.
2021-04-30 15:42:21,wallstreetbets,I used to work for a company similar to MF- I can confirm that they use click baity headlines just to get clicks and gain ad revenue. Outrageous headlines gets more views so companies just play into it. Stupid I know.
2021-04-30 16:08:37,wallstreetbets,"Change over SPY needs clarification. 6% vs 3% on relative basis is 100%. So you are comparing absolute scales, chart needs that qualifier"
2021-04-30 17:01:17,wallstreetbets,"[In response to this data here](https://preview.redd.it/oo61ht373bw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c8d785445785475c739f84ea3638bb820420bb2), the difference over SPY certainly is not 3%, 13%, 47%, and 63% respectively.

It should be 100%, 118%, 235%, and 89% respectively."
2021-04-30 17:45:31,wallstreetbets,This is useless. Compare it to the NASDAQ QQQ at least. SPY has so many duds...
2021-04-30 17:50:03,wallstreetbets,Wtf I love Motley Fool now
2021-04-30 18:49:10,wallstreetbets,"any idiot could make money over the last 8 years with all the stock buybacks, fed stimulus and twist money injected into the market"

2021-04-30 19:54:10,wallstreetbets,"Now do Zacks. I‚Äôve been taking advantage of the fact that you can renew your free trial through some tricks. Some of their picks work, some don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm struggling financially but invest the little I can. I wonder how much I‚Äôd need to have invested to come out even from their recommendations including their portfolios"
2021-04-30 09:03:38,wallstreetbets,Thank you so much for your rec.  Interesting that Jim Cramer said about PLTR that it s a black box. Rarely does he not have an opinion on a stock. Boy  are we in for a rollercoaster may 11th
2021-04-30 10:08:10,wallstreetbets,"Did we do a risk-adjusted return analysis? Non-adjusted returns are useless because of course you could 3x the S&P if you take 3x the risk in a bull market, then just go buy SPXL. I want to see if they beat it on a portfolio-beta adjusted basis"

2021-04-30 10:46:43,wallstreetbets,I signed up for the $100 subscription and I am happy with it so far.
2021-04-30 10:40:04,wallstreetbets,I've been subscribed to MF since around 7-8 months and I wouldn't say I'm disappointed. My portfolio is still red and not making much but the companies they suggest are quality investments which I've heard or read about having good value from other sources too.
2021-04-30 15:57:11,wallstreetbets,"I interned at the Motley Fool as a Equity Research Analyst. I can tell you that they are legit and have great returns. I personally think their advertising makes the company look scammy and cheap and that most people who aren‚Äôt familiar with The Fool agree with me. I do think they have a lot of smart people that think more out of the box and they have a really good investment strategy. As an employee I had access to all their services. I honestly don‚Äôt think the high end services are worth it unless you have $1m to play around with. If you can‚Äôt afford their high end services you can get a good idea of how they invest and stock buy tips from listening to their podcasts. Rule Breaker Investing always gives good stock ideas and the podcast obvi is free. I don‚Äôt work there now, but I think it‚Äôs a great firm and great place to work as well. Before I worked there I would just get an idea of the stocks they have in their portfolios by listening to their podcasts, adding to stocks they talk about to my watchlist, and then invest/trade after further research"

If it's terrible, then you might as well just leverage SPY and you'd easily beat them on a risk-adjusted basis"
2021-04-30 13:43:01,wallstreetbets,"What people here never talk about is that gains are not the only thing that matters.

How was their volatility over this time period? What is the Sharpe index?

They still vastly underperformed QQQ, which is the slightly more focused part of the market I tend to go into. I feel like Motley does not focus much on blue chips or established companies too much so SPY is not really a fair comparison.  You need to compare to a growth stock index, which have outperformed SPY the past decade."

I'm not saying your research was bad, just that if Motley Fool themselves think they could *consistently* beat the market then they wouldn't be the company that they are."
2021-04-30 15:27:32,wallstreetbets,"You can‚Äôt trust anyone‚Äôs investment advice if their narrative on GME is to forget about it. Single worst piece of investment advice anyone could give anyone this century.

Motley Fool are cunts just like the rest of the MSM and even though I believe this information is accurate, any attempt to quantify their advice otherwise is an indirect extension of the FUD narrative being peddled by those with painful short exposure IMO."

2021-04-30 09:23:11,wallstreetbets,"Any active strategy with half a brain could beat the S&P 500. Portfolio concentration in ""better than  average companies"" instead of buying the whole basket of SPY is almost guaranteed to outperform"
2021-04-30 10:28:40,wallstreetbets,"Didn't read entire post, but I've been a member since January. I noticed both on their Rule Breakers and Stock Advisor services that some of their recommendations from February and March don't make it on their Performance section which calculates their LTD performance. They make weekly recommendations on Thursdays, sometimes for more than one stock, usually 2-3. Some of these stocks made it to their Performance tab at the time and some didn't. Some of them that made it on their were DELETED since. If you look at Performance section, you will see that there aren't weekly adds there. If they make weekly recommendations, why aren't all of those on there? That being said, they do have some interesting opinions and the way they do their DD on their MF Live. You just shouldn't buy anything they recommend and so your own DD."

2021-04-30 10:51:30,wallstreetbets,They're basic cons. They remove losing stocks from their portfolio to raise their ROI.
2021-04-30 10:53:50,wallstreetbets,"I signed up to them last year and have benchmarked them not only against the market but against other investments newsletters as well, and they have consistently beat everyone. I find the memes on them here quite fun but if you‚Äôre remotely serious about your investments, 100 bucks a year for a solid source of stock picks is well worth the money."
2021-04-30 12:38:04,wallstreetbets,"Motley is almost as bad as Kramer, Jon Stewart did a montage if him making predictions next to opposite outcomes then traced back all his advice to his sponsor's market desires. Motley Fool seems right up that alley."
2021-04-30 12:40:30,wallstreetbets,"It would be more interesting to see risk-adjusted returns, or at least also include the volatility of their picks.  It could just be that the Motley Fool picks are more volatile than SPY, which will outperform in a risking market.  Sort of like how ARKK has similar risk-adjusted return to QQQ, so you could take the latter and screen for high beta stocks only and have done just as well as ARKK.  The 2017 paper suggests they do outperform SPY on a risk-adjusted basis; is that still the case, and by how much?"
2021-04-30 13:13:51,wallstreetbets,Thank you for accounting for starting price point in this analysis. Wouldn't it still be better to invest in SPY unless you blindly invest in all of their recommendations in equal sized positions? We're evaluating MF here as if it was an ETF with equally distributed holdings.
2021-04-30 14:43:04,wallstreetbets,"Honest question: is 2x/3x SPY a truly good performance? I don't know what a professional investor looks like in returns, but this doesn't look amazing to me."

I'm curious about how you modeled the sell recommendations.  Is it as simple as the sell price was $X and today it's at $Y and Y>X?  Or was their interest on X?  Or (what I think the most interesting case is), did X get reinvested in other recommendations that didn't get a sell recommendation?"
2021-04-30 10:38:47,wallstreetbets,Whoa good stuff. They also have daily Fool Live content that is useful and educational. I tune in sometimes and learn a lot. Their advisors are very smart and preach sound investing. Small price to pay for education.

2021-04-30 10:46:09,wallstreetbets,"1) Did you compute risk/volatility of their picks ? It is easy to beat the market by taking more risk. You need to find the risk adjusted return or compare their returns to an index fund with equal risk. One way would be to find beta for their picks and see if beta is above 1 for most picks or does it average to 1.

2) It seems like you calculated the return of all stock picks from the next day of recommendation to some end date .. then took the average return ... in real life to get this return one would need to invest an equal amount whenever they made a recommendation (I.e have an equally weighted portfolio ...) . So this limitation should be added. If people don‚Äôt invest equal amounts for all recommendations their return could be different ."

2021-04-30 11:08:00,wallstreetbets,"Interesting.  

There's definitely a Motley Fool effect where the stock jumps up *because* they recommend it, although that will only account for a small part of the gains.

I am assuming that when looking at the sell advice you were selling and then leaving the proceeds as cash rather than reinvesting in their other recommendations?  I think the argument when recommending the sell isn't that the stock won't go up further, just that the money can be better invested elsewhere."
2021-04-30 11:08:46,wallstreetbets,Do you sell the recommended stocks from previous month and use the precedes to buy the stock recommended on the current month? Is this how you calculated the return?

- MSM exist to sell stories AND influence viewers.

To make money and stay in business, MSM and Financial media have to provide something of value - for MF this value is by generally giving market beating tips.

However if I was a billionaire like 90% of MSM owners are (and possibly I even also own a HF like Motley, if those claims are true? I haven't fact checked) then I believe there exists a 'tipping point' if you will. Where perhaps for a specific stock I stand to gain much more than I lose overall by spreading a false narrative.

Perhaps in specific circumstances where I get paid significantly to push a particular narrative.

Perhaps I know my audience are majority boomers so I'll just say what they want to hear and GameStop is attention grabbing and they already made their mind up on it.

Just some random counter thoughts I'm not smart enough to analyse further."

They were the young irreverent upstart Wall Street outsiders, viewed with skepticism and disdain by institutional investors. How dare they tell people they don‚Äôt need a professionally managed mutual fund and you can do it yourself? They had a very devoted following.

My first intro to the stock market was their investment guide book, probably over 25 years ago. It had a lot of solid information.

2021-04-30 11:30:49,wallstreetbets,"I actually purchased their Stock Advisor service last year to help me get started. While there wasn't any extremely amazing information, I used their historical picks as a basis for many of my initial investments & just about doubled my money in a few months. And while it was fairly easy overall to make money in the market last year, I still feel that it was money well spent. 

Then I found WSB and I've been on the losing end of FD's & YOLO's ever since..."

2021-04-30 11:45:25,wallstreetbets,"I've used Motley Fool for years.  Here's why I stay with them:

1) I know next to nothing about the stock market.  To me, it seems part investment in companies, part legalized gambling, and part corrupt manipulation/scamming on the part of the very wealthy.  I don't have the knowledge, skillset and resources to do the needed research.  I want nothing to do with the rest of it.  Other than buying a few shares of GME in protest of the corruption.

2) Motley Fool, as far as I know, bases it's recommendations on company research, not on emotional triggers for example.

3) I've done well with them.

Ignoring Motley Fool's clickbait is as easy as deleting an email.  Given how many I delete every day, it's nothing to delete one or two more.  As for their email titles, I have more of an issue with the over the top of the political and fundraising emails.  And I get way more of them."

2021-04-30 12:04:11,wallstreetbets,"This is actually quite interesting. 

I immediately assumed it would be all bad news. So much clickbait and BS on the free pages about good stocks and their fervent desire to turn people off GME and AMC had me thinking that in general they'd be trash. 

I find their clickbait strategy odd, psychologically speaking.   
For me, it makes me **not** want to ever subscribe, because it erodes any trust I could have had with them as presented in their free media.   
Does this suggest a lot of people (or enough people) resonate with their free media and thus subscribe?   
Or perhaps their subscribers are generally from a wealthier bracket of society and they subscribe to multiple stock pickers and just follow them all to measure returns? 

Obviously pure speculation... But interesting all the same. 

This actually has made me considering subscribing (yes... I know, I'm sorry fellow smoothy's) just to put 10-30k into some of their picks for some longer-term stuff that I don't need to think about too much so I can keep the rest of my play money on shorter-term higher risk but (potentially) higher reward plays.

A person who has no idea of who/ what you are, just tossed a fuckin üíé in the mix of coffee. This is what drives me nuts and also makes me feel better about being able wear my helmet in public. As well as speaking up for myself when all the other sheep wanted to go to the lake and drink it, but ""I"" said no, because the ""humans have shat and cleansed themselves"" in the very water that has a sign which clearly reads for drinking use only... But we are not heard, when we tell them to stop. They don't care, instead they look us right in the eyes and say, ""there's no sign and even if there was, what are you going to do about it!!!?""

Together for whatever it's worth, we collectively found the voice.. again. ""I"" = we. ""We"" = me. This person took time, which is a Fucking counterfeit of it's own but I will definitely not dive down that rabbit hole today.

Instead, I want to thank you for your research and then thank you for actually trying to provide proof of the retardeness in which you have made more public and known. 

We take this forgranted. We truly don't appreciate what we have. I'm able to communicate with all of you, via the phone in my Ape palm. 

I'm so proud of All of you. Coming together and not seeing anything else, other than words that are on your' screen. The Honest communication between two people or millions; and not once have we ever ""gone"" to a place where we ask for one to tell us their race, gender approved terms or more. That is something I can be proud of. That's was my ceiling, that just made everything my Dad taught me... Actually fuckin mean something.

My dad is black and was a Black Panther(one can not simply quite being a Panther).. walked with MLK and fought for this very country during Vietnam. Raised a little white ape who's father abandoned not only this little ape but forced my mother to do things just make sure I was clothed, feed and sheltered. I watched my dad get pulled out of our car and tossed on the ground like garbage, because someone didn't understand that when I say that is my Daddy, I really meant that was my Daddy. When police asked me why I am with this ""monkey"" amongst other very nonsensical comments. I never said anything else other than that is my Dad. 

In short, we are stronger together now and they just got the memo that there really is a fuck load of US. And we are old as fuck and young enough to cumm 17 times in 1 go.

2021-04-30 12:11:51,wallstreetbets,"My question here is can you do a control group?  For example Over the last 8 years how would picking random stocks or following the most trending stocks compare to the market. I know some years back a hedge fund set out to prove fault with the S&P 500 as a measurement and they beat it by building a portfolio of 50 random stocks.

If TMF is no better than picking random stocks you can save yourself $100 every year."
2021-04-30 12:13:33,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for doing this, I am a Motley Fool subscriber, but I went in kicking and screaming as a last ditch effort to help out my very unbalanced portfolio that I rushed into at the tail end of a good run that instantly hit the toilet bowl. The picks have really held the line against a lot of the volatility compared to my ‚Äúhot stocks‚Äù and so far I am glad that I subscribed. I bundled the Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers services. 
Here‚Äôs what you REALLY need to know in addition to OP‚Äôs insights before you decide to subscribe:
Motley Fool‚Äôs philosophy suggests having at least 15 of their picks for a diversified portfolio, which is probably good advice, however the reason this could be a problem for new investors or investors who have hit the skids a little and want less volatility or better insight is that the share cost of most of the equities they recommend is really high for someone new/younger. I added up the cost of all of the current Stock Advisor picks and a few of the Rule Breakers picks (I picked the cheaper Rule Breaker equities to be fair) and the total cost for just 1 share of each company came out to $3,564.55! 
I would imagine it would be pretty tough for a lot of people to get started building a portfolio at that rate of spending, so my point in bringing this up is that it‚Äôs not really in a ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a no brainer system that every investor should get started with‚Äù kind of price range."
2021-04-30 12:14:36,wallstreetbets,So just to get this straight the analysis is from 2013 to present. While We've been in the longest bull market in history.

These were also stocks that I dropped on the market's way down and got back in very near the bottom in March 2020. Suffice to say, Motley Fool's advice has been excellent compared to riding the S&P. I agree that the clickbait emails and web articles are excessive, I don't fall for them anymore, but the info in them is good and always accurate."

2021-04-30 12:24:58,wallstreetbets,Would a more accurate comparison be a small cap fund vs the SP500? Motley recommends mostly companies that aren‚Äôt listed in there so it‚Äôs a somewhat biased comparison.
2021-04-30 12:25:33,wallstreetbets,"Smart people go in together for a one time payment on Motley's highest ranking service. This gives you access to all their recommendations. Look for the reoccurring picks across multiple services, do your research then buy and sell when you want."
2021-04-30 12:29:13,wallstreetbets,"Is there any sort of analysis on the performance of specific stock picks ?

Just like Cathie Wood would not be who she is had she not picked Tesla, I wonder if some of these outsized returns are the result of just a couple picks, or are they strong throughout?

Ultimately, something like Motley Fool is a feedback loop.  If these picks were made in ""secret"", returns would probably normalize."
2021-04-30 12:29:41,wallstreetbets,Just remember the Motley Fool is a Hedge Fund.
2021-04-30 12:29:45,wallstreetbets,Did you add Motley fool as a factor? Change in price/volume due to recommendation. Other than that this superb well done
2021-04-30 12:30:17,wallstreetbets,Would this not be skewed by the fact that over that time frame we were in a massive bull market? Would they hold up as well if we were in a bear market or more of a mixed market

Would you mind elaborating on how the ‚ÄúAverage changes in price‚Äù were calculated?

For example: in a portfolio where stock A went from $1 to $2 (100%) and stock B went from $10 to $11 (10%) do you consider the average change in price to be 55% (1/2 of the sum of 100% and 10%$ or 18.2% (total profit over the total cost basis of 1 share of A and B)?

I am fine with the clickbait articles. As a subscriber(to Advisor and RuleBreaker cause I can‚Äôt afford the higher levels), I could do without the constant email spamming asking me to RSVP to their hour long commercials for the more expensive packages that are poorly disguised as investor advice. They will give you a snippet of potentially valuable info in the last minute of the video, and spend the rest trying to get you to sign up for some 1k+ package, and then spam you even harder with: ‚Äúyour deal is about to run out‚Äù, ‚Äúexpires midnight‚Äù, and then the next day...‚ÄùGood news!

2021-04-30 13:03:35,wallstreetbets,The issue I have is that you‚Äôre not buying and selling immediately as they make a recommendation.

So not bad at all, I like them.

No arguing that following their pics would have worked over the last 8 years, but that doesn't instill any confidence in me for their future pics.

2021-04-30 14:04:33,wallstreetbets,"What is the breadth of their recommendations?  Like... do they make a recommendation about mostly large firms or mostly small firms?  This increased performance could just be the result of them recommending riskier strategies than the S&P500 represents.  Basically they might still have a lower Sharpe ratio than the market, but are recommending a strategy considerably farther out on the line.  

A more informative way to look at this is to compare each and every recommendation against the appropriate benchmark (maybe an industry ETF) for the time frames they suggest.  Then see if the average or median recommendation outperforms the benchmark."

2021-04-30 14:19:19,wallstreetbets,"TL;DR: 

This comparison is cool (and awesome work!), but it doesn't take important factors (like how risky a stock is) into account.  When these factors are included, Motley Fool recommendations over the last ten years have not outperformed their benchmarks, and so it's probably not worth paying for.

Post:  

The peer reviewed research piece has the comparison needed - it uses multifactor models to control for other factors besides just market returns.  Things like whether or not the stock was a value stock as well as the size of the firm.  These things affect results, because they represent different levels of return.  Basically, you don't want to compare Amazon to Verizon, because they have different levels of risk and therefore different expected returns. So we need to be making an apples-to-apples comparison, and the paper you found does this.

And this paper says that when they use factor models to investigate both the abnormal returns around announcement of their recommendation, and the long run buy-and-hold returns of their recommendations, they were only really outperforming the benchmarks in the earliest period (2002-2006), and this was by about 4% over the lifetime of the investment.  For other time periods, they find no significant differences, which suggests that any difference in performance is due to random chance.  

Also, even if you ignore the statistics side of things, the coefficients that they estimate are getting smaller and smaller.  Essentially, when they first started, there was enough noise that they were able to find good investment opportunities.  But as time went on, they got to be considerably less talented in terms of stock picking.  It's also possible that they were simply good at picking stocks in the wake of the [dot.com](https://dot.com) bubble bursting, and had abnormally high returns from that one specific event.  Their lack of consistency following this suggests that this is a likely scenario, and they are currently out of their element.  

Basically, someone was likely to get lucky early on in the internet blog days, and it was them.  That gave them credibility and so they're still here even if recent performance does not warrant this.  They compensated by picking riskier stocks, and the bull run of the last decade bailed them out."
2021-04-30 14:19:33,wallstreetbets,Motley Fool is a hedge fund with a newspaper!! Of course they're recommendations do well. 1. They are professional investors and more importantly 2. They get to tell thousands of people to buy the stock they like/have invested in. Totally not market manipulation though right? Just a news publication putting out articles on stocks /s
2021-04-30 14:19:57,wallstreetbets,"The question that I don't think could reasonably be answered by this is, ""How much of their success comes as a side-effect of their perceived expertise?""

In other words, do these stocks out-perform the index in large part because of the MF recommendation?"

2021-04-30 14:41:38,wallstreetbets,"I used to work for TMF. Here is my insight. The marketing is horrible, but the analysts that make the products are, in general, intelligent, hard working and knowledgeable.

They do often beat the market. I know my product did. 

The real issue is that it is hard for clients to replicate it. Most clients can‚Äôt buy a recommendation a month. And if they miss out on the three or four recs that smash it, they‚Äôre left with the dross. 

So the services rely on clients being savvy enough to pick the winners among their suggestions. 

Seriously they aren‚Äôt bad though"

2021-04-30 15:06:36,wallstreetbets,"Their most recent strategy is sending members of thier flagship services, stock advisor and rule breakers, marketing emails admiring they don‚Äôt give you the best picks off the bat.  They have been sending two or three times daily emails showing me how much return stocks have done since being recommended in those cheaper, $200 services, and then comparing them to how much MORE u would have made if you had invested in the same stock when they rec‚Äôd it 2-3 prior in their upper tier $1500-2500 service.
I like thier analysis, learn a lot from the podcasts, but to me they are a marketing company, and my biggest fear was that they were holding out on the smaller investors, and saving their highest conviction picks for their most expensive services.  
Of course we knew they were, but now they are straight up telling me they‚Äôd be more honest if I gave them more money.

2021-04-30 15:26:08,wallstreetbets,"One of my problems with any source that suggest buying and selling stocks is that - usually - within a day or so of the ""news"" being published, it's no longer that valid.

For example, if they do the top 10 stocks that are a good value, then in a very short time, it's no longer a good value because the price went from (for example) $23.67 per share to $89.65 per share because of the article.

Unless you find and take the advice before the other million people, you're still SOL. It may still be an okay stock if it pays good dividends and continues to rise over time, but it's no where the same value as if you had gotten in before the quick rise.

And honestly, I wouldn't be surprised to hear that all those ""tips"" are hints from wall street, not real research.  Because stock prices rarely reflect the strengths of a company or their profit margin."
2021-04-30 15:28:25,wallstreetbets,"They seem very clickbaitish sometimes, but a lot of times they are the only people reporting solid information on certain stocks. They can take positions on the stock market that a lot of other companies cannot because of conflict of interest.

When a service wants to charge $$$ to give picks, they need to be able to pick 'em early and be right, not pick 'em after they already took off and proved themselves.

Id call it *The Motley Tool*. IPO at $6M"
2021-04-30 17:05:11,wallstreetbets,They also put articles out to influence public opinion.  I dont know if you put this into consideration.  They got media as tools to bull or bash a stock so there prediction/recommendations always come out
2021-04-30 17:05:18,wallstreetbets,"Super curious on the influencing impact those recommendations have on the stocks they pick. As in, what effect does recommending a Buy for a stock to a million subscribers have on next day price increase. 


Additionally, I'd be curious to know the amount made by those who know the Motley Fool recommendation the day before the recommendation, and are able to make buys that Tuesday/Wednesday before and sell the Thursday and following to those it was recommended to."
2021-04-30 17:07:17,wallstreetbets,Lol. This place is bought and sold hard as fuck now. It's legit comical.
2021-04-30 17:11:22,wallstreetbets,3% in a quarter is terribad lol.
2021-04-30 17:13:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they‚Äôll put you onto a reasonable stock, which produces those nice headline figures.

But as stated - you won‚Äôt see those returns, as they‚Äôll fuck you."
2021-04-30 17:21:18,wallstreetbets,"Have to consider time value of money on the sell recommendations. That last 30% might not be worth as much as getting into a new trade.

Nice analysis."
2021-04-30 17:23:21,wallstreetbets,"OP I expect some hard data to back up this claim. Like I want to see your math and data or this is all bullshit advertising to me.

Even if the info is true, im guessing its because theyve made aggressive tech picks during a a long bull run.

If they even do ok during bear markets, well they should be running a investment firm, not making clickbaity articles."
2021-04-30 17:24:26,wallstreetbets,Nice...do Investors Business Daily (IBD) next!

2021-04-30 17:32:14,wallstreetbets,"Well, since it would be better to NOT follow Motley fools‚Äôs sell recommendations, and they‚Äôve been telling us to sell GME for the past three months. . . 

Bullish asf"
2021-04-30 17:33:12,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll read in full later, but wanted to drop this.
Motley Fool has an ‚Äúinvestment firm‚Äù little people know about.  Their articles coincide with their holdings.  So... if I buy 1000 shares of something with my firm, I use my platform to rally people to my picks.  Of course they‚Äôll do ok.  Not a bad business model if it wasn‚Äôt so sneaky.  

I wouldn‚Äôt even care if they owned stock and made a case for it.  But their negative articles lead me to believe they are their short positions.  THIS is where it get ugly and treads into manipulation.  Lies and exaggeration, with tiny little redactions later after they got the effect they wanted.

Here is their sister site.
 https://www.mfamfunds.com"
2021-04-30 17:34:45,wallstreetbets,Their bullish articles on stocks I own are exceptional while their bearish articles on stocks I own are just complete trash!
2021-04-30 17:44:00,wallstreetbets,"The articles are shit. But the paid services give results. They are both Motley Fool, but they are not the same thing."
2021-04-30 17:45:06,wallstreetbets,Did you adjust for beta? Hard for me to believe that on a risk adjusted basis that the outperformance was that high.
2021-04-30 17:45:45,wallstreetbets,What kind of returns do they get if you trim mean them in other words take out the couple massively ridiculous winners because they picked Amazon and Netflix and a couple other sort of no-brainers 10 years ago. How do the other 95% of their picks actually Fair against the market. I'd also like to know how they've been doing against the market the last couple years versus the 5 or 10 year average which again is juiced by a few massive winners post-great recession.
2021-04-30 17:48:56,wallstreetbets,What's your daily adderall dosage?
2021-04-30 17:49:13,wallstreetbets,"Also in one year I'd like to see how great this subreddit thinks it is. Pre-pandemic it got its balls chortled by a ridiculous Tesla run up and the obvious tech stocks starting to go up and then the pandemic year is a throw it out the window if you didn't make a shit ton of money in the last year than you don't know what the fuck you're doing here.  I don't know what I'm doing and I went from 70,000 to 700, 000 before the Giant market small cap and spac crash in March that devastated my portfolio which was way too leveraged"
2021-04-30 17:49:45,wallstreetbets,"Im pretty new in stock trading and I very much only dabble, I basically don't understand it that well and I just occasionally peruse this subreddit. One question I have related to this, and it may be a stupid question so apologies: if Motley writes articles etc advising on certain stock, does that in itself not go some way to influencing the success of that stock? I guess in the same way that Reddit made GME rocket (again I only have a basic understanding of this too), do Motley articles not drive prices, as a large number of investors are likely to read that advice and act on it? I suppose what I'm saying is how can you truly discern whether their predictions would have turned out exactly the same without their promotion of said stocks? In other words, was their advice indeed sound irrespective of them publicising it, or does the action of them publishing it actually improve the value of their advice.

I guess in the end even if my question does make sense it's not actually that relevant, as at the end of the day it doesn't matter what influences share prices, as long as they do what you predict/want them to do. But I'd be interested to hear from anyone who understands this better than I do whether there's a chance what I'm saying could be an important factor."
2021-04-30 17:49:56,wallstreetbets,But what about comparing to risk-adjusted returns? The sp500 is considerably lower risk I assume?
2021-04-30 17:51:04,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit you guys hate them too?!?! I put $500 into one of their premium membership recommendations to buy that month just to see and after I was at a loss of $300 while still in the trial period, so like 2.5 weeks at that point, I canceled it and got a refund. I know it was a recommendation made for like 2-5 years and it‚Äôs one recommendation, but that‚Äôs still just bullshit. It was specifically recommended to buy that months, and if anyone would have waited 1 month they could have gotten it at well under half the price. 

There were other stocks like that where it was basically like cool by the time you see if it‚Äôs shit or not according to their timeline you will have been paying them for like 5 years. 

Also there are like 4 levels of premium with the first starting out at $100 a year. They make it sound like that‚Äôs everything content wise but it‚Äôs just the start."

2021-04-30 18:22:37,wallstreetbets,Are you able to find old recommendations going back that far? I used to subscribe about 10 years ago and just joined again out of curiosity after reading your post.

2021-04-30 18:48:46,wallstreetbets,"My personal experience with The Fool was not great. It seemed any stock they recommended had already gone up by the time it was released to subscribers. Say a release happened at 11ET, whatever stock they released had already seen a bump since open. Options already had high IV so you couldn't really make money buying puts or calls.  After that it seemed to be 50/50 if they would have any more run up before close, if so it was minimal compared to where it was from 11, but considerable compared to the previous close. They were also really pushing Luckin coffee last year."

2021-04-30 16:26:44,wallstreetbets,"Several years ago, I was convinced NVAX (which I picked up as a MF recommendation during the bird flu outbreak in 2005 or so) was going to make me a bundle.  I was planning on telling all my close family and friends to get some of that free money.  But a small doubt kept telling me to just keep my mouth shut.  I only ended up telling one friend and fortunately he just blew it off.  Shortly thereafter, they bombed a vaccine trial, the stock lost 70% of its value overnight and later on there was a 20-1 reverse split.  I was glad I didn't cause anyone to lose money, but in late 2019 I was down about $300K myself on that stock and it was looking bleak.  Then COVID came around and I bought more shares last year.  Now my NVAX position is worth over $1.5M and with EUA around the corner, it's looking ready to explode.  Now I wish I had told everyone I knew, but at these levels they wouldn't be able to buy enough to make any real money.  So, long story short, this MF recommendation ended up being a good one, it just took a decade and a half and a pandemic for it to come to fruition.  I did end up losing money on the other bird flu stocks they recommended though."

They misread the financial statements in our 10-Q and wrote an entire article about why we were a bunch of liars and everyone must sell our stock immediately because we were obviously committing fraud (they didn't flat out accuse us of fraud, instead they hedged their entire article with weasel words like ""like"" and ""as if"", so that there was no legal culpability for libel).

My company's board of directors was very concerned about this article and wanted to know if there was any validity to the claims, so they sent a bunch of questions to the CFO to investigate. I ended up having to write an entire memo outlining why Motley Fool was a bunch of fucking idiots who couldn't read a 10-Q if their life depended on it.

3 Months later when we released our next 10-Q, Motley Fool said we were an amazing company, we were blowing away everyone's expectations, and everyone should buy us up. There was zero reference to the previous article from 3 months earlier or why they changed their minds on us being frauds.

2021-04-30 10:09:29,wallstreetbets,"So: buy based on Motley Fool and hold. Buy based on Jim Cramer and sell 1 day later, when the rest of his readers have bought but before their self-doubt sets in. Then sell based on Jim Cramer.

Got it, thanks for the tips!"
2021-04-30 10:35:37,wallstreetbets,"This was a really thorough and well-researched DD, and I enjoyed reading it. Thanks for putting it together and sharing it with us.

2021-04-30 10:02:04,wallstreetbets,So I should suscribe to motleys fool and follow they buy advice but not the sell one?

2021-04-30 11:44:30,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs your sub?
2021-04-30 14:27:34,wallstreetbets,Are you going to publish more results from the program you built?
2021-04-30 10:01:25,wallstreetbets,Will you pls share your work...  the actual data.
2021-04-30 12:00:04,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve always wanted to see an analysis of the Fast Money show on CNBC. It seems like they only talk about mega cap companies but would be interesting to see that data.
2021-04-30 12:34:15,wallstreetbets,"When you subtract percentages you get [percentage points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point), i.e. p.p. and not %."

2021-04-30 13:31:05,wallstreetbets,Comment for later
2021-04-30 13:32:55,wallstreetbets,"Whats your occupation if you dont mind me asking, I want to learn how to do this data analysis, any recommendations?"
2021-04-30 13:43:51,wallstreetbets,"Solid analysis. My one glaring issue still is that with 8 years of data, it‚Äôs data from one of the best bull runs in history, which might skew the overall view. If you‚Äôre holding 10+ years though, probably would even out I guess??"
2021-04-30 13:53:23,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the sub?
2021-04-30 14:09:57,wallstreetbets,"Great analysis OP. I'm curious if you could give us a sense of what percentage of their picks beat the SPY in those same time frames you've identified? I'm sure that picks like Amazon and Netflix many years back have raised that average return for their whole portfolio quite a bit, but a new investor would be late to the party on. Curious if their more recent picks have still done pretty well."
2021-04-30 15:13:24,wallstreetbets,"Interesting and maybe it‚Äôs addressed elsewhere but how much of this is just the effect of the crowds. Like WSB and other social media cause movements in price. So do the subscriber base of motley fool. And the daily Cramer watchers? Etc. 

Like how many of those recommendations individually had monster returns and how many of them were merely average over time, but saw an initial bump following the recommendation? Any way to model the effect?"
2021-04-30 16:18:38,wallstreetbets,"Can I ask where you got the starting price for their investments for each data point? When I was in the industry, I found that the problem that a lot of academic papers would use is if say, a model (or advisor) on May 5th said ""Buy ABC"", the researchers would often use the closing price on May 5th as the opening price for the trade, even though the call may have been made after hours.

However, the problem is that a lot of this type of advice is given following news or earnings and so on. So, the May 5th price is no longer good and makes the entire report erroneous because it will, for instance, give the advisor credit for the 15% the stock was already up when they made their call, since they can see the stock is trading at $115 in after-hours, even though the stock closed at $100. Their ""investment"" didn't make $15 instantaneously, though it looks that way if you don't account for this effect.

You would actually, at best, be able to get the next morning's opening price (unless you have accurate after-market data and knew the exact time the piece hit). And even that is subject to whether the Motley Fool timestamps are accurate. So, I just wanted to give a word of caution about market data like this when examining past results for a model or advisor. Don't use that same day's close as the entrance price. If you can, I'd even redo the analysis investing a week after Motley supposedly made each call instead of instantaneously investing.

****
Edit: clarified a little."
2021-04-30 17:21:13,wallstreetbets,Now use the stock price of next day high value so it‚Äôs a worst case buy scenario.
2021-04-30 17:25:52,wallstreetbets,I'm glad you did this I got a lot of hate for backing motley fool in here. I subscribed for a month or so a few years ago Roku and Shopify were their top buys.... Wish I had held on.
2021-04-30 11:55:21,wallstreetbets,"Your ""analysis"" on Cramer was based on impossible buying situations. It's not worth a damn thing."
2021-04-30 11:40:53,wallstreetbets,I mean not hard to gain in a bull market.
2021-04-30 16:08:55,wallstreetbets,"There is a part of me that feels like this is some brilliant marketing by some MFer at MF to reel in WSB subscribers.  

It‚Äôs going to work, and if OP isn‚Äôt getting paid by MF, they should be."
2021-04-30 10:38:40,wallstreetbets,"I've never subscribed, but their recommendations have always done well for me."
2021-04-30 11:56:33,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it's an unpopular opinion for sure but I've been fairly happy with their recommendations, especially when I was just getting started and having stock recs combined with explanatory articles about things like DRIP were really helpful. They also made me a good chunk of money on a few Canadian penny stocks and early BEP.UN.  

The important thing to keep in mind is that they have a bunch of different writers. So in addition to the clickbait titles you'll also see contradictory opinions printed the same day, which is really a positive thing so long as you're reading their DD and forming your own opinion"
2021-04-30 13:46:37,wallstreetbets,"I have SA too, and they keep trying to upsell me. I just got an add trying to get me to subscribe to ""Rising Stars"" for $1500 ($500 off!). I'll pass. But they did give me one of their 10 picks for free. Apparently DCBO is a rising star."
2021-04-30 13:11:19,wallstreetbets,I also have used MF for over 10 years. They usually choose solid companies. Some of their other products choose 5-7 stocks every few months. They are bound to hit a home run sooner or later.
2021-04-30 14:54:52,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been a subscriber for a few months but I can not read their emails. How do I discern the garbage?
2021-04-30 17:33:48,wallstreetbets,"I let my subscription go a few years back, but their recommendations did well for me. Still holding and gaining in several positions."
2021-04-30 18:29:55,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a weird marketing campaign.  All their research a d actual advise is in well written articles that make sense.  But all their marketing articles just scream clickbait.  I‚Äôve been a subscriber for 4 years and have smoked the genera market so I can‚Äôt complain.  But I completely understand why people are turned off by their clickbait titles to draw you in.
2021-04-30 15:39:51,wallstreetbets,"I made 50k with lmnd in their buy recommendation, then I tried to repeat it while the market went nuts and it lost 50%, so I lost 25k due to margin call. I thought I had set a stop loss but it disappeared or I just forgot dunno."

2021-04-30 15:55:48,wallstreetbets,"Find someone to split it with and it‚Äôs even more worth it. I got a $99 for 2 year offer, split the cost with my brother and share the picks. $25/year isn‚Äôt bad at all, and I just unsubscribed from all emails."
2021-04-30 11:01:25,wallstreetbets,"speaking from personal experience, yep"
2021-04-30 17:25:02,wallstreetbets,"IME, yes. Just turn off all email alerts except ""sell notices"" so you don't get spammed. If you have a friend that invests you can split the $99 membership with them. I made the $99 back in less than a week."
2021-04-30 12:33:18,wallstreetbets,The fool is a buy and hold method and NOT an actively traded strategy. They almost never sell. The only time they do is when the company itself shows itself to be failing or something changes the initial perspective in them buying it such as departure of the CEO or exec team or something along those lines. Its rare to have them recommend to sell a prior recommendation.
2021-04-30 15:33:16,wallstreetbets,I recall visiting their website in the 08-09 market crash. I think all of their services were lagging the market (maybe except one or two) but they bounced back rather rapidly as the overall market did.
2021-04-30 12:40:38,wallstreetbets,That's what I was saying lol. By stock picking during a bull market you have a good chance of beating the S&P as the S&P gets dragged down by poor performing sectors. Lets see this comparison starting from Motley's inception.
2021-04-30 15:00:29,wallstreetbets,Yeah - the performance gap is wild. Nasdaq returned 2.5X the SP500 from 2007-2020: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/when-performance-matters%3A-nasdaq-100-vs.-sp-500-fourth-quarter-20-2021-01-27
2021-04-30 09:26:41,wallstreetbets,Making more money with X rather than Z is all what people wanna know around here.
2021-04-30 09:58:38,wallstreetbets,Do you work for Morningstar or something? Nobody in WSB gives a shit about risk. Your talking to a sub full of people who yolo into far OTM options near expiration.
2021-04-30 10:17:48,wallstreetbets,How do you do that?  My investment strategy is 100% SP500 for the next 30 years.  So I don't care at all about short and medium term risk.  Is it possible to follow this strategy to increase returns long term?
2021-04-30 17:54:21,wallstreetbets,"I'll just piggyback here because I'm basically adding to your comment.

**MF are in fact not providing alpha, but instead appearing to provide alpha because they are compared to the wrong index.** 

They like to compare themselves to the SPY, because they know they'll look good doing that, and the SPY has historically been considered ""the market"". But there are other places to put your money. And my guess is that their over-performance over the SPY can be fully explained by their picks being weighted differently than the SPY.

Doing a quick search around the internet, I find that many of their picks seem to be mid-to-large cap growth stocks. These stocks have had an unprecedented last few years (I say few because 10ish years in the market shows nothing). So I'm assuming they are basically riding that train.

If that indeed is the case, then a fairer comparison for them would be the QQQ. 

The QQQ has about 2x:ed SPY since 2013.

So MF has under-performed QQQ if I understand OP."
2021-04-30 10:55:10,wallstreetbets,Couldn't the same logic be used with the MF portfolio? If you are going to 2x spy you could also just 2x MF
2021-04-30 10:19:44,wallstreetbets,Exactly. What's the beta of this portfolio? How well-diversified is it?
2021-04-30 13:25:36,wallstreetbets,"Great comment.  Anyone can beat the market in this bull cycle by simply buying 2x or 3x SPY ETF.  The issue is what will happen when the market crashes.   

For someone looking at FIRE, it's not just portfolio size x rate of return but the sequence risk as well."
2021-04-30 10:41:06,wallstreetbets,"Uhhh, this sounds like r/investing advice. All we care about is alpha, because we are too stupid to learn the rest of the greek alphabet. 

Seriously though, the higher the volatility, the better the play.  How are you supposed to YOLO on a flat line. (Yes option plays, I know but that's not the point.)  If the volatility isn't at least 100x the boomer index, you can count the WSB crowd out.

You make more money buying into a stock that halves and doubles every single day for a month and ends the period flat than one that slowly and steadily creeps up by 10% over the month.

Edit: fuck you reddit mobile for duplicating comments."
2021-04-30 11:20:50,wallstreetbets,are you sure you‚Äôre in the right sub? not a single YOLO or emoji to be seen and it all seems to make sense but the username makes it a little sus

2021-04-30 13:27:35,wallstreetbets,"No one cares. If person A has an average return of 10% over the past 10 years, but person B has a return of 15% BUT he took on more risk, so what? He has more money."
2021-04-30 12:10:09,wallstreetbets,This went way over my head.
2021-04-30 12:30:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah the period analyzed has been a historic bill market marred by a brief Covid downturn
2021-04-30 13:25:00,wallstreetbets,You can‚Äôt just choose a leverage and earn that multiple of the SPY. If that was the case I would just get in 100x leveraged SP500 and make average 700% returns.
2021-04-30 13:25:11,wallstreetbets,This is the comment I was waiting for. Thanks!
2021-04-30 17:13:28,wallstreetbets,"I asked a few family members to make an account on Webull so we could get a few free stocks. I showed them that I got 4 SNAP when it was $70 from just one referral. All but 1 refused. They didn't believe there wasn't a catch. They literally refused free money.

2021-04-30 11:15:26,wallstreetbets,"Nah mate, he wanted to compare MF‚Äôs monthly recommendations. They do it once a month, every month. That‚Äôs when their recommendation comes and its pretty clear. He made a comparison of the clearly delineated recommendations with the S&P and they came out on top. Accept it. Trying to claim the comparison isn‚Äôt valid because ‚Äòyou might be influenced by their other emails‚Äô is silly and trying to pick weak holes in their victory. 
But obviously they‚Äôre still c$$ts."
2021-04-30 08:51:01,wallstreetbets,Motley stock picks outperform spy from 2013 until now. And they are a bit of a üåà üêª with paper hands.

2021-04-30 10:52:19,wallstreetbets,S&P doubled in the last year. So...
2021-04-30 11:25:52,wallstreetbets,"I had so many stocks that doubled or even tripled, then crashed hard in the past few months. Learned my lesson that things don't always bounce back from a bad dip, especially not when the market all around is crashing multiple times."
2021-04-30 09:24:51,wallstreetbets,"Technically, they are still bullshitting. Even though it is upwards of 3x returns over the market, the rewards aren't 10x the market that some of their ads say you will get."
2021-04-30 13:58:56,wallstreetbets,"I think in that case it would be similar to Cramer. If you look at the comment OP posted, Cramer stocks surge the day after but then go down again and in the long run are not beating the market. But the MF stocks outperform the market on the long run as well."
2021-04-30 17:01:45,wallstreetbets,Doesn't really factor in with the MF in the long term. They hold for 3+ years so any bump will only last a few days. For this reason the MF recommends averaging into positions so you don't have to pay a premium.
2021-04-30 16:07:56,wallstreetbets,You could say the same thing about wsb
2021-04-30 09:35:53,wallstreetbets,"According to his analysis, he assumed you bought at close **the day after** they sent the buy recommendations. So they still did quite well if you were always a day late to the party."
2021-04-30 09:32:17,wallstreetbets,"Well, if this was the case and it was significant enough, it would have showed up on the OP's analysis; yet clearly they did outperform, so probably didn't matter much."
2021-04-30 10:20:52,wallstreetbets,That's a bold assumption. Do you think everyone who subscribes buys every motley fool recommendation?
2021-04-30 10:36:29,wallstreetbets,"What's scummy about their business model? I just check their picks sometimes when they show up in my newsfeed. But, those picks have made me dollars in the tens of thousands, so I'm inclined to think well of them."

2021-04-30 14:22:47,wallstreetbets,This is such a stupid argument. Why would anyone teach anything if they could do it better? There are tons of companies in all industries that just work with ideas or information.
2021-04-30 14:39:50,wallstreetbets,"If Motley Fool can beat the market at the rates OP said, good.  If Motley Fool can beat Motley Fool by writing articles and selling stock picks, good.

The former is constrained by capital.  The latter is constrained by demand.

What if you could run your own business with costs of $50/month that gave you returns of $200/month, and by using your own service you could also then have ""costs"" of $unlimited/month that gave you returns of <4x/month?  

Wouldn't you maximize the higher return and then use the rest of your capital on the lower but infinitely scaling return?

I have no idea if they do this, but I'm guessing their ""cost basis"" is a lot lower for their service than it is to invest in their own picks."

2021-04-30 12:41:40,wallstreetbets,They are useful because they employ a different strategy then WSB. They are interested in investing in solid companies that will thrive over time (theoretically to the point if indefinitely). They are less interested in the stock price especially over the short term because they know that time is ultimately on their side as long as they actually are picking strong viable companies. Its always smart to hear multiple perspectives.

The market went up 586% in that time giving you a beat on the market of 21,987.4%.  A $1k bet then would be worth $227k now (just under 2 decades later as well). 
  

They also re-recommended AMZN at 12/17/10 (then $177.58) and 10/18/2018 ($1770.72) plus its been on its starter list (and best buy now lists) on and off a ton of times throughout the decades."

2021-04-30 13:39:36,wallstreetbets,"I don't think this analysis disagrees with that. The articles are written by freelancers with pretty loose affiliations with the site.

But that's a different question from whether or not the premium recommendations are any good."
2021-04-30 17:49:29,wallstreetbets,"The OP is analyzing Motley Fool‚Äôs subscription based stock recommendation service, not the freely available articles. They explicitly mention this more than once.

So, who the fuck are you arguing with? First, you don‚Äôt seem to realize the investment service and the free articles are 2 entirely separate things. Second, you clearly paid zero fucking attention to OP‚Äôs analysis. 

This happened when somebody analyzed Cramer‚Äôs Mad Money picks. The analysis showed clear long term gains from his picks, but the comments were full of idiots who didn‚Äôt read a fucking thing. 

If you aren‚Äôt going to show OP the minimal respect of reading the fucking analysis, don‚Äôt fucking comment. Nobody gives a shit about your sob story we can‚Äôt confirm and don‚Äôt believe."

2021-04-30 10:40:17,wallstreetbets,"its relevant for this thread because the OP is talking about actual medium-long term investments rather than option YOLOs (the whole thread probably doesnt belong here but whatever)

also risk management is still important for option YOLOing unless you are literally just gambling. The whole point of YOLO options is high leverage so your risk tolerance is going to affect how many you buy and the strike price youre wanting."

2021-04-30 12:52:16,wallstreetbets,You can use leverage to be even more exposed to the S&P 500. Look at e.g. LEAPs.
2021-04-30 11:59:25,wallstreetbets,I think what he's saying is using 2x leverage on SPY moves you closer to the same level of risk as no leverage on Motley Fool picks. So that makes it a better comparison.
2021-04-30 12:32:48,wallstreetbets,"When comparing different portfolios it's usually not done by absolute returns but by risk adjusted returns. A guaranteed 5% return with no risk is infinitely better than any risky portfolio. At least in theory.

That's why you calculate the Sharp ratio to compare the returns per amount of risk. The best portfolio can then be hedged to the personal risk tolerance"

2021-04-30 11:55:43,wallstreetbets,"I have no beef with OP's work. I was commenting on the method MF computes and advertises their 450+% return vs. the S&P. When I see a ""Best Buy Now"" email, I consider it tantamount to a recommendation. They do not, and it's not reflected in their calculation of return. If you do not consider it a recommendation, that's fine. It's up to you. Their advertised return is correct in that case. I personally find it unintuitive, which is a charitable way of saying ""deceptive."""

Idk why they assume everyone on is ignorant"
2021-04-30 17:58:12,wallstreetbets,"This makes a lot of sense; perhaps they realized it's more profitable to be a media company than an investing firm.

All of this talk of beating the market has let me down a bit of a rabbit hole. Apparently it's actually not that hard to beat an index like S&P because it's an index of large caps weighted by market cap, and apparently weighing large caps by literally any other metric will perform better.

For instance an equally weighted S&P fund (RSP) outperformed SPY over the last 18 years by almost 29% even accounting for RSPs higher fees. But the flip side is sometimes these other funds will underperform for years before outpacing the S&P, so sometimes people panic sell (not a problem for the denizens of this sub). 

Thank you and OP for making me think harder about what it really means to beat the market."
2021-04-30 11:51:51,wallstreetbets,Yes. I don't need a job if I could do well. :)
2021-04-30 09:58:16,wallstreetbets,"Wrong. Stock market is not a casino. The type of stocks we deal with in WSB is, but a majority of the Spy stocks have fundamentals that can be analyzed and clear winners and losers. Ie.. everyone is staying at home.. not a secret mystery that companies like Amazon and Apple are performing so well and revenue is through the roof."

This program has remained successful because of the inadequacy and vanity of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions.

Welcome to the world of **Mail Order Penis Enlargement!** This little business is a little different than most cosmetic surgery. Your product is not solid (sic) and tangible, but rather a service. You are in the business of extending penii. Many small of endowment are happy to pay big bucks for this service.

(The money made from the penis enlargement is secondary to the income which is made from people like yourself requesting that they be included in that list.)

* Immediately cut off your penis at the base.
* Cut off the head of your penis, and pack it in ice.
* Take the remaining midsection of your penis, and cut it into 5 pieces of equal length.
* Immediately mail each piece to the first 5 names listed below starting at number 1 through number 5. Send penis only please (total investment your penis). Enclose a note with each piece stating: ""Please add my name to your mailing list."" (This is a legitimate service that you are requesting and you are paying your penis for this service).
* Remove the name that appears number 1 on the list. Move the other 9 names up one position. (Number 2 will become number 1 and number 3 will become number 2, etc.) Place your name, address and zip code in the number 10 position.
* Post the new letter with your name in the number 10 position into 10 (Ten) separate bulletin boards in the message base or to the file section, call the file, **MAKE.PENIS.FAST.**
* Within 60 days you will receive over 50,000 inches of PENIS. Keep a copy of this file for yourself so that you can use it again and again whenever you need penis enlargement. As soon as you mail out these letters you are automatically in the mail order business and people are sending you their penis to be placed on your mailing list. This list can then be rented to a reconstructive cosmetic surgeon that can be found in the Yellow Pages for additional income on a regular basis. The list will become more valuable as it grows in size. This is a service. This is perfectly legal. If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18, Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the postal lottery laws.NOTE: Make sure you retain EVERY Name and Address sent to you, either on computer or hard copy, but do not discard the names and notes they send you. This is PROOF that you are truly providing a service and should the AMA, FDA, or some other Government Agency question you, you can provide them with this proof!  
Remember as each post is downloaded and the instructions carefully followed, five members will be reimbursed for their participation as a Penis Enlarger with one inch of penis each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your name reaches the number five position you will be receiving thousands of inches in penis."

2021-04-30 16:59:36,wallstreetbets,"Short story time. Because who doesn't like a boring short story.

12 years ago, I was starving and homeless and weighed 109lbs at 19 years old. I enlisted in the army national guard and the meps dude lied on my form about my weight for my height. Not sure if it was on purpose or not but he put 119lbs which was just a hair bit over the minimum weight requirement. I went to Fort Jackson and ended up getting discharged towards the end of basic when I hit a manic episode and suffered psychosis while I was there. Got a diagnosis of bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features. But that set me straight on my life because I walked away with a few thousand dollars and was able to afford a place to rent for a few months.

I grew up poor, as the eldest of my siblings, I didn't even have hand me downs and we relied on donations. I remember when I was 8 or 9, for 6 months or so, pretty much all we ate was homemade bierocks. My mom made them out of bisquik, cheap meat, and cheese slices. 

I grew up in this weird junkyard - trailer park place near Strawberry Plains, Tennessee. Damn near had my ear torn off by a 3 legged dog, totally irrelevant but now in my 30s its kinda funny. 

Etc. I grew up poor as dirt and some of the poorest I've seen short of being homeless. Hell, the only reason we owned a home was because my dad passed when I was 13 and my mom used his life insurance to get a mortgage. At 17 I dropped out of high school to work full time at McDonald's because she got addicted to pain pills and kept missing work so we fell behind on the mortgage payments. 

If I ever come back with a million+, I have no idea what I'd do with myself. I'm doing alright now, I pushed my tech career to the 6 figures in the midwest, which is pretty damn good. I save money and invest some here and there. But that's about it."

In the sector I work in (computing and IT) I almost never look at the numbers at all, because I have a better understanding of who the players are and their relative merits. Maybe I'm just lucky, but my overall portfolio is outperforming the market by around 97% (I am almost doubling the S&P) over the last year.

But who cares if I put my investment in an advertisement if the advertisement was right and made me money? If there's a series of advertisements that have consistently allowed me to outperform the market, I will do what those advertisements say all day long. The reason it's not coincidence is that there's someone on the other end doing research to put the recommendations together. At the end of the day, results are what matter, and so far they've gotten me plenty of results.

Edit to clarify my percentage over the S&P."

2021-04-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Quick TA DD on CLOV as of 4/29/21 Hello my fellow apes, I have been a long-time lurker of this sub ever since I joined, but today I have decided to bring you a TA DD as of 4/29/21 price action for CLOV.

As of 4/29/21, CLOV opened at $11.22 and closed at $10.17 with previous closing price of $10.50 (-3.14%). Clearly, our positive momentum was beat down hard yesterday. This was most likely due to two possible reasons:

* The market displayed a bearish sentiment in general against the medium/small/micro market caps while most of the large market caps was up (ex. FB) which explains why DOW, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 were all up by EOD.
* MVIS crashing hard which caused a ripple effect of panic selling across popular stocks like CLOV, AMC, GME, and MNMD.

&#x200B;

[Daily chart of CLOV](https://preview.redd.it/byclt37gzaw61.png?width=3766&format=png&auto=webp&s=156907323ac0c10051c6051276d9d110e5c4640c)

**Fibonacci retracements:**

Looking at the chart above, Fibonacci retracements clearly show that we failed to cross over the 38.2% resistance level of $11.14 due to the reasons described from the previous paragraph. The 38.2% resistance level will be crucial heading into today's trading session (4/30/21) as crossing over the resistance level would mean we have a high possibility of testing the next resistance level of 50% at $12.34.

If we continue a downward trend today (4/30/21) and go below the support line of $9.65, the 23.6% level will be shifted from being our support to a new resistance level. And of course, that's not a good sign since it would signify that there's a chance for us to reach back to the next support level of $8.53. Based on the historical trend, CLOV has been consolidating at around $8.53 and have been using $8.53 as a major support to bounce off so if this downward trend continues to spiral down, I would expect to see a bounce at $8.53 mark and rally back up.

&#x200B;

**Elliott Wave Theory:**

Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, with yesterday's candle, it seems like we are heading into wave 2 which is a corrective wave. Today's price action will confirm whether we are officially heading towards a wave 2 or not. If today's price action confirms that we are in wave 2, I do NOT expect to see CLOV dipping further than $8.53 based on the explanation provided from the Fibonacci section and expect to see a bounce and reversal pattern to wave 3. In contrast, if today's price action shows a positive momentum, this will be a bear trap which means shorts will get fucked even more.

With wave 3, I expect us to smash past 61.8% resistance level and face a major resistance test at $15.77 area. Wave 3 will be a key area for us to see how far our upside really is, but just know that if we smash past the resistance at $15.77, we will be able to test for 52-wk ATH price of $17.45 again. And if we cross over the 52-wk ATH price, sky is the limit for us and we are all going to the moon.

As for the other waves (wave 4 and wave 5), expect to see an eventual healthy pullback from wave 3 and literally launch off to the fucking Mars by wave 5. I'm going to guess that wave 5 will most likely occur after the Q1 Earnings which is May 17th. That would mean that we will see wave 2 and wave 4 happen within the next 2 weeks. So, expect our journey to the moon to be a bumpy ride but know that the chart is absolutely bullish for the take off.

&#x200B;

**Other:**

* Golden cross pattern detected on the daily chart, highly bullish sentiment.
* RSI is centered out. Depending on today's (4/30) price action, we will find out if we are still in bullish sentiment or heading back to bearish sentiment based on RSI.
* Daily MACD chart is still looking bullish as MACD line is still above the signal line, reinforces the idea that we are still in the bullish phase.
* Triple bottom and we've bounced off every single time, another bullish sentiment.
* All around we are still seeing a lot of bullish indicators. Let's hope that yesterday's price action was a bear trap.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

All this speculation is contingent upon continuous increase in the volume level and buying pressure. Expect a bumpy ride, but based on my TA, we are primed to launch off hard. So, go tell your mom, your dad, your family relatives, and your friends to buy CLOV and hold instead of becoming paper hands and panic sell because if we hold, we are all going to the fucking moon.

**Tl;dr: We are going to the fucking moon, don't be scared of the setbacks and don't panic sell.**

2021-04-30 19:34:00,wallstreetbets,"Problem is now that alot of us are waiting for May 17th. 

Imagine how many people are gonna dump on either that day, before or after? 

Their earnings call is also at premarket 8.30am ET, it's either gonna dump or moon hard, literally a gamble

I'm Holding 2975 shares @ 10.03 & 3 May 21st calls 12.50 strike

Not saying gonna moon and whatever, but after seeing what happened to stocks like Mvis, shit I'm actually scared lol"
2021-04-30 09:02:26,wallstreetbets,"Ahh I wish this was out there yesterday. I may get some poop for this, but I bought a few $11 6/18 puts yesterday at open and sold before close. Judging by the after hours and this DD, I should have held.

Apologies, fellow apes, for going against the grain. I‚Äôve seen too much volatility in these types of plays to not go for it.

Also, I‚Äôm an idiot, have no clue what I‚Äôm doing, and sometimes it hurts when I pee."
2021-04-30 09:49:33,wallstreetbets,bag holder reporting @ 11.50!

I have no more money! But I have gme 10@350 still holding. And will sell CLOV to buy more GME when we are on the moon."

2021-04-30 08:53:29,wallstreetbets,"Wow. I‚Äôve been listening to empty hypsters and hopesters, but this thread is what actual DD looks like. Thank you for the lesson!"
2021-04-30 08:46:46,wallstreetbets,So keep it in there is what you‚Äôre saying?

2021-04-30 10:41:09,wallstreetbets,"Good TA. Considering some intense short pressure, it's comforting looking at strong support at the 8.53 level, and thinking it could test 15.77 in a couple of weeks. I plan on keeping at least half of my holdings long term. I'm taking a little heat, but I'm also in VXRT, looking to next week, so that's helping a bit."
2021-04-30 11:33:27,wallstreetbets,Can someone do an astronomy DD on clov next?

We were super young kids then. That s what MVIS is doing again, it s the casino mafia that rotates like that. They really went to pennies after hitting 72, and it s searchable . They are thieves"
2021-04-30 08:32:26,wallstreetbets,"Great work. To someone new like myself, DD like this helps me to learn what to look for when doing my own research.

2021-04-30 08:44:16,wallstreetbets,"Testing block trade support at 10.16.

If we drop below that, we might test weekly low at 9.03, although there are a couple of block trades standing before that at 9.60 and 9.40 respectively.

Looks like low volume and MACD is bearish.

I suspect we drop today but perhaps not to the 8's just yet.

(Sorry, my MACD is looking at 15mins at present. The daily is still stonking it high.)"
2021-04-30 08:44:47,wallstreetbets,Awesome! Ty

2021-04-30 09:08:57,wallstreetbets,MVIS was under a dollar and a complete shit show for a company. You morons let these paid accounts tell you to go all in. Now they‚Äôre doing it with clov AGAIN and you‚Äôre gonna get hurt AGAIN. Stop being so fucking retarded and do some research.

I bought at an avg of 11 and sold at 24. It was clear the stock was overvalued and IMO still is. Don‚Äôt buy a stock based on made up rumours of a buyout. Just because their down the road from MSFT doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre buying them..."

However, as long as the buying pressure is greater than the selling pressure even with a lower volume, we should be fine. TA will still hold up as long as the price action respects the $8.53 support line. IF CLOV dips further than the $8.53 support line, I would start worrying then. As of right now, we are hovering around the lower $10 range so we are far away from that speculation for now."

2021-04-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Verbund Fundamental Analysis & DCF Hey,

I was looking at VERBUND AG these past few days and think that there is a potential play here as sector and currency risk diversification.

In a nutshell they are Austria's largest hydro producer and also engage in electricity trading. They have also partnered with Google and are trying out AI systems for machinery maintenance and better electricity trading.

The firm is profitable with a high margin (EBIT margin 28%), very stable with a bottom up beta of 0.43, has long term prospects, and is flexible as they can expand the grid vs production in the event of the appearance of external cheap energy sources.

The company is also reinvesting in capital projects which will fuel growth in the future. These projects are backed by research for quality control, digitization,¬†artificial intelligence systems, trading and supply.

Future investment plans include new renewable energy¬†generation which will amount to a profitable development of approx. **20‚Äì25%** of Verbund‚Äôs total electricity generated from onshore **wind power plants and solar power.**¬†

They are also engaging¬†R&D projects for **green hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources**.

The company seems to be trading around its intrinsic value based on my DCF valuation.

[VERBUND VALUATION REPORT](https://datastudio.google.com/s/nJpIhYUYVRQ)"
2021-04-30 08:30:08,wallstreetbets,"This is not a shit company.Hear they appreciate only the shit companies that have negative eps etc.But to tell you my humble opinion , if it‚Äôs price is close to its intrinsic value then I don‚Äôt think there is a lot of money to be made."
2021-04-30 09:14:13,wallstreetbets,"I used to own Verbund stock. For me hydro (which they are heavily invested in) is to energy what gold is to the traditional market. It takes huge investments to ""mine"" but then it is sustainable and reliable.

Verbund is close to the Austrian government and people.

I sold mine because my hands have these big holes in them, that I needed to cover. Feel that its a good stock to rely on."
2021-04-30 09:28:17,wallstreetbets,"This stock might be good for a pension fund or the bean counters at r/personalfinance

It‚Äôs a shit stock for WSB. Are there even options available for this ticker?"
2021-04-30 08:45:34,wallstreetbets,I have been looking at this too although haven‚Äôt bought yet. I think it‚Äôs a good hedge against USD and inflation. If the US experiences inflation Euro will too but not as bad because the printing is not as much. Also utilities are a decent hedge against inflation anyway because people always need energy and energy prices will rise along with everything else.
2021-04-30 08:45:50,wallstreetbets,Where do their generation assets sit in the cost curve? Does Austria open their electricity market to generate outside Austria?

2021-04-30 09:37:17,wallstreetbets,No options as far as I can see
2021-04-30 08:46:04,wallstreetbets,Also in Red Electrica Corporacion which is a Spanish utility.
2021-04-30 08:58:00,wallstreetbets,"They are producing cca. 35% of Austria's electricity needs with almost 3k syndicated employees operating 129 plants. They also buy close to 50% of their power from external sources and trade it in the home market, Germany, France, Romania (a minority of distribution).They are very cost effective with an average (12 month) gross profit margin of 62.2% or COGS of 37% - Which (COGS) decreased from 53.8% (12 month average) in 2018. So they are further reducing costs for production"
2021-04-30 08:35:01,wallstreetbets,"If I were you, I would suggest to invest only if you firmly believe in their future.But if US go down Europeans going down too, so if you want a hedge against US economy choose something different"

2021-04-30 06:51:44,wallstreetbets,"Futures are pointing to a lower open on Wall Street. Small caps seeing the worst of it with the Russell 2000 off about 0.6%. Nasdaq is down about 0.5%, the S&P 500 by about 0.4% and Dow 0.3% lower.

Commodities and bonds are being sold off a bit as well. Crude oil down 1.5%. 10-year yields up to 1.647% That‚Äôs as of 0625.

The selling appears driven primarily by Covid concerns. Rising cases in India and Brazil. New variants. How many times have we seen this story? The toll in India appears to be serious from a humanitarian viewpoint. But the global economy has demonstrated it can adopt to quarantines and shutdowns

Inflation may be a concern as well but that appears secondary in this morning‚Äôs activity. I say that mainly due to commodities prices dropping. And the bond sell-off is not particularly serious at all.

But watch for more inflation concerns in the personal income expenditures and income reports for March, due out at 0830. This is the preferred gauge watched by the Fed (more than CPI). The PCE is expected to be 0.2% higher MoM. If the number exceeds that then the inflation drum will start to beat, perhaps loudly. 

That, more than anything, will move the Fed to taper and eventually tighten. And that, more than anything, will put an end to the bull market.

We are also due to get quarterly earnings from Chevron and Exxon Mobil before the open. Consumer staples Clorox and Colgate-Palmolive report during market hours."

2021-04-30 13:31:21,wallstreetbets,"We are at a potential turning point. In many ways, much of the best days of the recovery are behind us now. This was probably one of the best quarters our economy will see for a while. Valuations are saturated but there is nowhere else to stash money (which there is a huge surplus of) and the fed is still aggressively providing stimulus. Large risks on the horizon are potential rate hikes, inflation, tapering, disease flare-ups, and recession from these massive GDP numbers. The market is hanging in the balance right now without much catalyst or directionality. Any movement lately seems very reactionary and temporary. I'm honestly not sure what the play is, but cash gang for now while I decide what to do with the capital I have left."

2021-04-30 08:07:32,wallstreetbets,"MVIS bag holder checking in.  I listened to the entire call.  So boring.  Earnings sucked but that was expected. However it was also expected that they announce an acquisition or partnership which did NOT happen!  They simply went from saying they were ""exploring options"" to negotiating potentials... and wouldn't comment further.  They are also under NDA with customers and cant say shit about shit. They have a customer that pre paid 10M and once they fulfill that qty the customer will buy more.  So basically the earnings reported no news other than they completed a test production line to prove to potential partners that their product can be mass produced (which is good!) and their product innovation is promising.  Rumors are still acquisition by Microsoft, Google or NVIDIA (MSFT Hololens 2 uses their tech and now their focus is self driving cars etc) but no one knows when...

Edit: they did make it clear that their main focus is shareholder value and future acquisition! Most promising part of the call. 

So do I buy the dip and wait for acquisition or take my loss and move on? Decisions decisions...but I tend to hold."

2021-04-30 12:11:11,wallstreetbets,"If it's just for 2 years, you're better off with 2 years ITM, or OTM but with more time to maturity, LEAPs. They should give you a nice leverage. Use an online options calculator to see how much you can make and use the IVs you see on your broker app or on Yahoo Finance's option chain +/- 5% (best case scenario for you is the IV goes up in 2 years, worst case is the IV goes down, try all these scenarios). Assume in 2 years SPY will be up by about 30% (based on the assumption that it gains on average 15% per year).

EDIT: of course no options calculator is needed if you buy 2 years LEAPs and decide to hold until expiry, in which case just compute the payoff you expect in 2 years, no need for the IV."

I‚Äôve seen the opposite with a lot of beta videos showing the software is still very much beta and this is with very few drivers on nice California streets. Then look at all the public abuse of autopilot which they collectively think IS self driving software.

Tin foil hat time, Tesla didn‚Äôt release their software because they were leading the industry but because they were so woefully behind. Their competition didn‚Äôt feel the need to put it in public hands yet, In fact this is the fear that mobileye had before they left Tesla, that they would do this. When they took their software and went home, elon had to scramble with his vision only approach."

2021-04-30 06:19:40,wallstreetbets,True. Very true. Personally I love Tesla I like Elon just because he's a billionaire that doesn't give a shit about PR. I especially love Tesla options I don't know how many times they've brought me from red to green and I need the stock to bleed today.

2021-04-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Aurora Cannabis: Unusual Options Activity ACB $9c 05/21 üöÄ üåô Gather around my fellow degens. Breaking news from the potheads at Barcharts.

Aurora Cannabis (ACB) has had an influx of calls in the past two days. Yesterday, they were for calls dated after earnings comes out. Today, there were 2,975 contracts of $9c traded which are set to expire on 05/21. This represents $190,000-210,000 of activity in one trading day buy-side in this one specific option. I‚Äôm personally in the $12 call option for 05/21, but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm retarded and love to go out of the money.

Earnings for Aurora Cannabis are set to be reported after-hours on 05/13. The underlying stock was sitting at $7.65, a one-month low on the holiday of 04/20 (oh the irony). Since 04/20, the stock has been making its way upward, sitting right below the $9 level of resistance. I expect Aurora Cannabis (ACB) to jump over the $9 mark tomorrow, on April 30, 2021. 

I will be loading up on even more out of the money call options which are set to expire close to the earnings report. I expect the next two trading weeks to be extremely volatile, with an upward trend which peaks within a day or two of the earnings report. Once we hit earnings, the stock is likely going to come crashing back down to a normal $8-10 range. Don‚Äôt be shocked if you see it breaking $15 for a short period of time on the earnings report release week.

TL;DR Buy ACB, smoke free weed."
2021-04-30 00:16:17,wallstreetbets,As someone who activly watchs ACB it does this every few weeks tbh. Ive seen it fluctuate between 8-10 for a while every once in a while breaking out in 11.

2021-04-30 00:39:19,wallstreetbets,Any DD on Earnings? because uninspiring earnings have been hurting cannabis stocks in the past few months.

2021-04-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs official. I‚Äôm retarded. While attempting to sell 150 calls on $CLOV I accidentally bought 150 may $25 calls today near the high like an idiot. Need your help with this one boys $CLOV guess I‚Äôll chalk this one up as a YOLO 
2021-04-30 02:00:53,wallstreetbets,"Real talk OP If you want to fix this aside from selling to close.

Sell 300 $28 calls and buy 150 $29 calls. This will turn your long $25 strike calls into $3 long call spreads, while adding $1 short call spreads above it, creating a butterfly spread. This will claw back premium and if by some chance the stock takes off, it's still profitable, with max profit at the $25 strike.

Edit: I wasn't looking at the option chain when I wrote this out, so the strikes available may be different.  This is just an example of how to create a butterfly spread when you already have existing long calls. You can adjust the wings however you want by adjusting the strikes, though you should keep the short wing smaller than the long so you're covered if the price runs."

2021-04-30 05:55:31,wallstreetbets,Unless it expires in between $28 and $29.  Try riding these but don't let them expire.
2021-04-30 11:39:03,wallstreetbets,"There's no $28 or $29 calls available though, only $25 and $30

Given $25Cs have 0.08 delta, the premium difference between $28C and $29C would be negligible anyways, and pretty much the entire premium would be eaten up by the massive B/A spread..."
2021-04-30 10:24:17,wallstreetbets,I don't see $28 or $29 calls on the may options chain soooo how does this work?

2021-04-30 16:55:13,wallstreetbets,"Are you sure that‚Äôs profitable?

A call spread should have your short leg with a lower strike right (so under $25)? Why are you using a higher strike of $28 and $29?"
2021-04-29 23:08:22,wallstreetbets,If that‚Äôs true I‚Äôll donate every bit of it to charity. Just going to ride it out and see what happens. I have 15k shares in clov so hopefully those pay off.

Clov 21 May 2125 C100 = Stock clov, date may 21 2021, Strike price $25. 100 contracts (which is 10000 shares worth). .35 is the price per contract he paid. Right now it's worth only .25 per contract."

2021-04-30 10:41:58,wallstreetbets,"We're talking about options.  You can buy or sell an options contract which gives you the right or obligation to purchase or sell a given sign at or by a certain date, depending on the contract.  If that date passes then the contract expires.  It's like buying insurance where the money you use for the premium goes away at the beginning the contract might cover you for a loss later on, except with options you can turn and and sell that insurance policy to the next biggest sucker.

In any case, options are amongst the fastest ways to lose money that I know of.  Whenever you see someone show monstrous loss porn and go from cost of a house down to twenty-three cents you can be pretty sure they bought options which expired out of the money.

Personally I'm a big fan of selling options to other people and letting them lose money to me.  It's a special service that I provide to the community. /r/thetagang if you want to learn more."

2021-04-30 07:58:53,wallstreetbets,"You would lose the bid/ask spread immediately, and if the stock is moving down you can lose significantly in a short period of time"
2021-04-30 16:55:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes and he should have. Don't turn a mistake into an investment. If you messed up fix it and take your loss as a ""stupid tax""."
2021-04-30 09:17:08,wallstreetbets,Ha I‚Äôm actually serious. Sure it would be cool making money from a mistake but it would be even cooler giving that money away for a good cause. I would do it anonymously though so they don‚Äôt keep calling for more.

2021-04-29 23:17:35,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it‚Äôs primed for a short squeeze and potential gamma squeeze. $15 next week isn‚Äôt unrealistic and we COULD see $30 by earnings. Definitely depends on buy volume of course."

2021-04-30 01:50:14,wallstreetbets,mods!
2021-04-30 09:23:07,wallstreetbets,Good on you. Everytime charity asks for my $ i simply must say my family needs my money. If your in a spot where your friends and family need absolutely nothing and your retirement is lined up good on you toss it to the wind. I will do the same but after im secure i will help the loved ones around me to catch up and bonus get to see a physical difference made by my tendies. Good luck purtner.

2021-04-30 00:33:25,wallstreetbets,"I guess everything is a short squeeze now. Like a bunch of fat midgets trying to fit inside their middle school jeans.

I'm starting to wonder if with the gamification and doubling of retail, and Active investors are playing a large role in starting these squeezes. We all came here to learn how to invest, then realized we were actually playing a game, a type of poker. A poker with the future. Our advantage stands with our numbers, and how we influence media and the general world narrative. A democratic hedgefund in a way. I'm here for companies that offer me and humanity something, I'll squeeze a few on the way to a better future."
2021-04-30 02:26:28,wallstreetbets,"Yes, because shorting hedge funds have shorted a fuck ton of stocks. And retail figured out that we can make these stocks squeeze. We've basically started gaming the system the way hedge funds have been doing for so long."
2021-04-30 16:48:30,wallstreetbets,"100% true. When you explain to that to OPs they just ignore it.

Since I am selling calls it works in my favor. Keep that IV high."

2021-04-30 16:54:01,wallstreetbets,Average volume of CLOV is over 25m. Even a perfect storm of ALL of those being naked and HAVING to cover instead of just rolling them out and it still wouldn't hit $25.

2021-04-30 08:54:06,wallstreetbets,Its a combination of a squeeze and retail jumping in. When stocks move 100% almost a day you can bet some shorts covered at least. Short squeeze doesnt have to be a 100% play either it can be like a 20-30% gain too
2021-04-30 03:00:02,wallstreetbets,Literally every one of those stocks were short squeezed.

We‚Äôre coming up on what will be the greatest market collapse of all time. Housing, on average, is going to collapse 50% across the board.

You then posted a web site that is just as bad as everyone here trying to predict squeezes that won't happen. Now, you are trying to predict a massive housing crash and poorly trying to relate that to the underlying of the stock market.

2021-04-30 06:56:09,wallstreetbets,But this isn‚Äôt even mostly IV induced loss. It‚Äôs delta relevant because the price went down.
2021-04-29 23:07:02,wallstreetbets,Yup

2021-04-30 01:21:55,wallstreetbets,Only if you don‚Äôt know what you are doing. Earnings can fuck you big time that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs better to sell options on earnings. That way you have both  vega and theta working for you. Where you buy all you have is delta.
2021-04-30 06:33:23,wallstreetbets,"Call spread bought on fb slightly out the money short and in the money long.

2021-04-30 01:40:06,wallstreetbets,But how will you harvest that tax credit???
2021-04-30 00:54:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeppp, wasn‚Äôt aware of IV crush before, so I‚Äôll definitely only play the run-up from now on. I was thinking that the earnings report could push the actual stock to high 130s which might increase the price of 143 calls, but apparently outperforming expectations means your stock at close is lower than at opening üôÉ"
2021-04-30 03:55:26,wallstreetbets,Same. Only bought 3 of em. Ah well
2021-04-29 22:58:38,wallstreetbets,"IV today was above the 10-day, 20-day, and 30-day averages."
2021-04-29 23:24:01,wallstreetbets,It stands for implied volatility and it is one of the variables (the Greeks) that affects the price of options. Basically stocks are expected to make larger than normal moves after they report earnings so the cost of any options that expire within a short time period after the earnings report date will be inflated. After earnings are reported and everyone sees the direction the price is going to move the IV goes down (crush) so the option loses value. That‚Äôs why it is usually not advisable to hold single call or put options that expire within 4-6 weeks after a company reports earnings through the earnings event. It‚Äôs not that you can‚Äôt make money it‚Äôs just that it is much more difficult because the expected move in either direction is ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù. The odds are not in your favor. You can be right about the earnings results and even how the price is going to move and still lose value on the options if the stock price does not move enough in your direction.

2021-04-30 12:42:03,wallstreetbets,I would imagine you could have made a nice profit had you sold them prior to this week?
2021-04-30 07:45:24,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre totally correct. Looks like he also took Delta Disappointment 101 on this trade too. 

The break even price on the trade was $143. That‚Äôs a big move considering other companies earnings had been good and AAPL was priced in already.

For all those people that were playing AAPL for the overnight gap as soon as it gapped and showed weakness everyone started running for the exits. The earnings were good but expected and with no new buyers of the stock a big flush happened.  

You can find bargains heading into earnings but they are still risky plays. I always look at the expected move. Lately, a big delta is already priced in for most stocks and the earnings play isn‚Äôt to go long calls and puts."
2021-04-29 23:20:44,wallstreetbets,"The opposite can happen, too. Had a buddy buy GME puts right before they skyrocketed. The IV made his puts worth **more** even though the stock went up lol"
2021-04-30 05:02:03,wallstreetbets,Usually your first one is free. This must be a good sign.

2021-04-30 01:58:36,wallstreetbets,I see I'm still new on options so I never tried selling options only buying options calls/puts
2021-04-30 08:16:52,wallstreetbets,Take your wife back from her boyfriend and make bebes.  Or just ask if you can claim the ones they make.
2021-04-30 01:35:46,wallstreetbets,"Apple didn't provide guidance, which is why it's underperforming.  Earnings are always priced in.  Giant corporations with AI modeling and tons of data already knew what apple would have made, but they can't estimate guidance.  Guidance is the only thing that matters after earnings.  

Since apple didn't provide any, that meant analysts had to estimate it and those estimates didn't look good.  They're imagining a chip shortage is going to impact their sales plus since earnings were so spectacular this time, they're imagining that the next quarter won't be able to beat it.  Best to get out now.

Apple actually never provides guidance and they always dip after earnings because of it."
2021-04-30 09:52:58,wallstreetbets,Even if the stock did get pushed to the high 130s your calls would still instantly turn worthless
2021-04-30 07:37:19,wallstreetbets,After earnings theres always a huge drop in iv its called iv crush everybody knows this
2021-04-30 06:26:49,wallstreetbets,What's a good resource to find the moving averages on IV?
2021-04-29 23:27:19,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for explaining that! Didn't know this. I'll know to never try to play options on earnings lol, or atleast until after I understand the IV crush more"
2021-04-29 23:42:45,wallstreetbets,You just explained why I‚Äôve been losing money on options. Can‚Äôt thank you enough.
2021-04-30 15:29:40,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately not rlly besides maybe Tuesday as aapl went on a downward trend last week
2021-04-30 13:38:57,wallstreetbets,You sound like you know what you're talking about. Will aapl get to 140 again?
2021-04-30 00:57:23,wallstreetbets,That is an extreme case but yea. IV skyrocketed to make that happen
2021-04-30 03:00:38,wallstreetbets,"Happened to me the only time I ever played AMZN options. Bought a call, stock tanked, I sold the same for a profit because of the IV spike. I was pretty new to options at the time and swore off AMZN because I was clearly in over my head. Lol"
2021-04-30 00:42:18,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-04-30 11:28:38,wallstreetbets,That happened to me with gme as well. I was new to this shit at the time. I was like wtffff is going on here lmao
2021-04-30 02:22:36,wallstreetbets,"Well, if you know a play is stupid... Imagine being on the other side. Selling options is awesome. CC is just like a dividend for owning stock that doesn't come out of the share price.

Love going down my list and closing them at 0.05 every week or two"
2021-04-30 12:08:53,wallstreetbets,"OP, apparently, did not know this."
2021-04-29 23:38:42,wallstreetbets,"You just have to buy more time or go very small and treat it as high risk high reward. For example, earlier today I bought a July expiration AMZN 3600 call because I was expecting an earnings beat and an ATH breakout, but I did not want the option to be worthless if I was wrong so I paid extra for the extra time. If AMZN hits 3600 in the coming days I won‚Äôt make as much as I would have doing a closer expiration, but my risk that the option would lose a lot of value overnight was much less.  You can also sell covered calls (if you own common shares of the stock) or sell cash secured puts or use advanced strategies like options spreads to turn the extra IV around earnings in your favor. A lot of people do that."
2021-04-30 14:34:59,wallstreetbets,I do think it will get there someday. I wouldn‚Äôt guess when. I will trade AAPL whenever I can scalp it or catch it on a swing trade. In the cases I really don‚Äôt care what the price is I just care that I have a good read on the movement.
2021-04-30 05:51:09,wallstreetbets,"Not really extreme, any volatile movement up is expected to come back down so puts premium increase. It‚Äôs not that uncommon."
2021-04-30 12:50:00,wallstreetbets,You were very smart.  Most would take a drop in the underlying with a profit on a bullish derivative as proof they really knew what they were doing.
2021-04-30 12:26:45,wallstreetbets,To make things worse apple went down not up
2021-04-30 03:33:54,wallstreetbets,So is it advisable to not play CLOV based on their earning reports on may17 too?
2021-04-30 10:03:43,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs rare that IV spikes so high as to outweigh the change in delta.
2021-04-30 06:17:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes, with puts"
2021-04-30 19:40:00,wallstreetbets,"You could try to catch a run up, but CLOV has had a big move in the last several days so it is scalps only for me. I don‚Äôt know much about CLOV‚Äôs business though so can‚Äôt say whether they are expected to beat or not. I do know that IV crush is always a thing with earnings so be careful and go small if you choose to hold through."
2021-04-30 10:04:22,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs happened in every meme stock.
2021-04-30 19:45:46,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the advice bro!
2021-04-30 10:09:42,wallstreetbets,"I would say meme stocks are rare, compared to the thousands of stocks out there."

2021-04-30 08:55:23,wallstreetbets,"It worked because most got relative small positions. I can afford to sit it out with 50 shares. Had I gone in big at $450 and bet the farm, I would‚Äôve probably bailed out when it came back up. (Or not.ü§©)"

2021-04-30 10:23:26,wallstreetbets,Sorry but it will never hit that price again but I wish you luck. Eventually they will have to show earnings to support going up. That being said I did very well on amc when it was cheap so thanks GME gang. üëç

I bought my first in Jan at 350 and have averaged down. 

It‚Äôs only the last couple weeks that I‚Äôve really started to believe. 

Can‚Äôt say as I see $10M as a reasonable number, but I‚Äôm on board so long as other apes are too. 

$100K would be pretty near life changing for my meager position, but only if it‚Äôs on the way down."

2021-04-30 06:37:33,wallstreetbets,People legit think they‚Äôre going to be millionaires from one share of gme. Hahahah this is ridiculous. I figured this would start finally dying off once people realized just how absurd that idea is. If it sounds too good to be true then it is. And owning one share to be a millionaire is ridiculous.
2021-04-29 23:36:53,wallstreetbets,Dope ass video :)
2021-04-29 23:37:58,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not a loss till you sell.

2021-04-30 05:40:21,wallstreetbets,I thought anything GME gets downvoted here now? I guess that must only be during the day when the hedgefund interns are on.

Me: NOTHING HAPPENED OK *sobs* leave me alone"
2021-04-30 06:24:55,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I really hope everyone at least gets their money back.

That was such a low blow move the hedge funds and Robinhood pulled.

And even worse is still the hedge funds are manipulating the price so much and no one will stop them. Makes me angry.

Sure ideally we all make a huge profit but tbh I don't have much luck with any shares so by now have low expectations for another squeeze.

2021-04-30 09:40:21,wallstreetbets,"ok you beautiful apes, It's fucking story time and I need some damn intel.  


When this all went into explosion mode I bought in 2@220, then another 3@120 and just rode the dip down until 5@80. it was fantastical and I thought I had 10 Shares of GME and 20 Shares of AMC chillin...  
However all these purchases were made through my little brother who had a robinhood account at the time and in the interest of acting right away, I sent him several hundred dollars to invest.   
HOWEVER AGAIN, bless the young man but his hands are made of fucking PAPER and he bitched this whole thing up- Now IT'S ALL GONE... Now I wanted to slap some sense into the boy but didn't have the heart to eat his face.  
NOW I have to jump back on the fucking rocket. I put 500 into my ETRADE account but the funds won't be available for another business day or something.  


SO MY QUESTION IS THIS. Will monday start seeing another monster spike and when do you think will be my last chance to buy in before 50K?"
2021-04-30 09:41:22,wallstreetbets,Bought my first shares at $343. I've been doing a lot of averaging down.

2021-04-30 09:40:07,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt wait for GME to normalize at around 30. GL with the 480 retards.
2021-04-30 03:13:29,wallstreetbets,"I FOMO‚Äôd the first time around at 270 (I had never invested or traded before and I literally knew nothing), watched it immediately go to 40 in a few weeks (lol), and I was like, fuck this shit never gonna trade again.

But then, by the power of friendship, GME gave me another chance. For some reason it shot up to 300 a second time around, at which point I actually could finally not only recover all my retarded losses, but even make a little profit while getting out of that pile of crap. Truly blessed.

Now after 3 months I finally kinda know what the fuck I‚Äôm doing and I‚Äôm actually being profitable by swing trading non meme stocks (long and short) and exclusively shorting meme ones lol (MVIS <3).

Truly belongs to Top 10 anime betrayals, but hell I‚Äôll take it!"

2021-04-30 00:39:48,wallstreetbets,"Technically, $483 would be your resistance level because the stock has yet to surpass that figure. A recent support level or bottom that appears to have been established, is around $150 per share...

2021-04-30 12:05:51,wallstreetbets,"I'd recommend the manga. No pacing issues; it's much less of a time commitment to read 1000 chapters than watch 1000 episodes. And just in general, you don't have to deal with cheap animation and annoying filler gags.

I know a lot of people don't like reading manga for action, but Oda is a top-tier artist in terms of page layout and paneling and clarity, which makes for really exciting and easy-to-follow fights."
2021-04-30 10:33:55,wallstreetbets,The arlong park arc is relatively early and is fantastic. It starts at like episode 31 but I‚Äôd personally say to just skip thru episodes if you‚Äôre not feeling them because some of the early arcs do drag on too long but they give context to characters you meet later on
2021-04-30 10:39:42,wallstreetbets,Try One Pace. they speed up/ cut up the episodes so you don‚Äôt spend 5 minutes watching people stare at each other every episode.

2021-04-29 23:37:06,wallstreetbets,Checking in üëç
2021-04-30 08:43:00,wallstreetbets,"you just buy ADDITIONAL SHARES at a lower price and your price average will fall down to a middle-point between them.

1 share at 300 and 1 share at 40 would give you an average of 170. So if the price goes above 170 you have gained profit enough to make up for the losses."
2021-04-30 08:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Say you bought 1 share @ 300. The price dropped considerably and has been hanging around 100, and that's rough because it has to go back over 300 for you to see a profit. But you buy 3 more @ 100 to lower your average cost per share. So now you own 4 shares with an average of 150 (you've spent 600 total on 4 shares). Now you only have to see that price go over 150 to see a profit! That's why when you're in the negative, it's a good idea to buy more when the price is low to ""average down"" and make your money back, better yet, see a greater profit.   


This is also why it becomes kind of like a gambling addiction, spending more money when you're negative, hoping for that price to go back up/skyrocket. Unless you know what you're doing! Which I don't, this is about the only part I understand. Am gambling addict ape. This is not financial advice."
2021-04-30 09:27:48,wallstreetbets,"Not quite. It just means you buy more as it drops (‚Äúdouble down‚Äù), which lowers your cost basis. That way, you can still profit even if it doesn‚Äôt reach your original purchase price. The strategy only works if the price actually does go back up though. 

Here an example. You buy 10 GME shares at $400 like the certified grade A ape that you are. It falls to $200 and you‚Äôre now $2,000 in the red. No problem ‚Äî you double down for another 10 shares at $200 ($2,000 total) and your overall cost basis is now $300. It keeps dropping, this time hitting a low of $100 and you‚Äôre down $4,000 on a $6,000 investment. You double down again at $100, this time buying 20 shares at $100 for $2,000 total. Your overall cost basis is now only $200 per share. It then shoots back up to $250 and you sell all 40 shares for $10,000.

Overall, you gained $50/share (average) and profited $2,000 when you would‚Äôve still been down $1,500 if you just held and never doubled down. There are a couple limitations to this strategy, first of them being capital limitations ‚Äî not everyone has the capital to keep doubling down every time it goes down significantly. Which leads into the second limitation: few people feel very confident betting on a losing horse, expecting it to *eventually* go back up so they can profit or at least break even. If it doesn‚Äôt go back up, you‚Äôre just gonna be doubling down forever and will realize even higher losses than if you‚Äôd just held onto your original 10 $400 shares. 

So yeah, it‚Äôs not a flawless strategy, but it generally works, especially if you have a fair amount of capital to throw at it. Things are often oversold & thus rebound, so doubling down works a lot of the time. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest it on something like MVIS tho.


Oh, and one more thing: if you‚Äôre planning on doubling down at some point, don‚Äôt go all-in to begin with. Instead of buying 20 $400 shares for $8,000 total, put some capital to the side so you can double down if it does end up falling, especially if you‚Äôre going long on a company.

Hope that helps!"

Before that, they were arrogant and felt invincible. They didn't even feel the need to hide their short interest and allowed it to proudly report 140% of float because *the fuck you gonna do,* buy enough to drive the price up?

Remember how after Reddit discovered what ""beta"" was like the bunch of betas we all are? They immediately started scrubbing it. 

GameStop was a failing Brick & Mortar store ever since Steam and such got popular.

But it kept refusing to die.

Then the living incarnation of the lovechild of Jesus and every single wife's boyfriend came and bought in to the company with the goal of transforming it. Then the lovechild of Jesus and every single wife's boyfriend's girlfriend pulled an Uno deck and told all 14 of his viewers about GME.

The rest is ~~history~~ happening now."
2021-04-30 06:19:15,wallstreetbets,"Not just robinhood, a lot international brokers or local brokers with US stocks did the same thing."
2021-04-30 05:57:16,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, it's the timing that matters rather than the amount. If the pressure had stayed on you might have seen more of the shorts panic buy to cover and that might have kicked off one hell of a real short squeeze. As it was, the break bought some time and reversed a bunch of that pressure in the short term and, I think, bought enough space for the uncertain shorts to get out."
2021-04-30 07:00:36,wallstreetbets,it was more than just Robinhood. Charles Schwab did the same shit
2021-04-30 01:38:59,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the dark pool thing?
2021-04-30 08:53:30,wallstreetbets,"They probably weren't doing that yet.  

And yes, by pulling the crap they pulled, Robin Hood changed the market sentiment and manufactured panic selling."
2021-04-30 06:39:57,wallstreetbets,"The answer is no, but you'll get downvoted for saying it.

Retail/robinhood users were never in control, big money came in and backed up the ""hedgies are fucked"" narrative and went in hard once it hit the news, raising the price and riding the wave. Big, big money was controlling all the GME price action.

This idea that ""hedgies"" are a singular thing is nonsense. Once some hedge funds realized other hedge funds were fucked and over-leveraged, and they saw the retail euphoria, so they joined in the buying. This is the main catalyst that moved GME.

The ""no more buying on robinhood"" thing could have hurt sentiment a bit, but it wasn't a huge factor. And it definitely isn't responsible for GME dropping all the way from 500 to 130, over several weeks."
2021-04-30 08:24:16,wallstreetbets,Maybe? But the more important thing is that the stock had momentum. RH killed that momentum.
2021-04-30 03:12:46,wallstreetbets,"Considering at the time 50% of Robin hood users had a stake in gme, yes. We've also learned that since then 8+ million users have left RH

A very strong guy comes to kill Luffy, Zoro trys to protect him. Zoro fails but is able to appeal to the guy that killing Luffy in his current state would not be honorable. The guy thinks and says he's right and that he'll leave him alive if Zoro takes all the pain he just endured from the fight (he has the power to do that). So a pain bubble about half the size of ""the bean"" in Chicago comes out of Luffy. The guy pulls off a bubble the size of a fist and gives it to Zoro, that small amount brings Zoro to his knees in agony. Zoro stands up and throws himself into the big bubble and this is the aftermath."

The shorts‚Äô backs were against the wall and margin calls and panic covering were setting in because they had no choice but to cover because they had lost control of the stock which would have set off the chain reaction.  What stopping buying did, more than tamp down buyer demand, it bought the hedge funds TIME, which allowed them to get on the other side of the trade.  Since the halt lasted Thursday and Friday (and even into next week with restrictions), they had ample TIME to cut exposure. Very similar to Burry‚Äôs situation in the big short when Goldman and others wouldn‚Äôt call him back...they were buying time to get on the other side of the trade before re-pricing their swaps.

2021-04-30 09:38:56,wallstreetbets,"Dark pool is supposed to serve exchange of stocks for market makers trying to buy/sell big volume of stocks. In DarkPool you negociate the price for the total of stocks exchanged and you don't move the price of the stock. We see since month many little amount of GME stocks bought  in dark pool because brokers use the dark pool to buy stocks asked by retailers but when retailer want to sell, they use the normal market. For this reason retailer have no more impact to move up the stock but have a impact to move it down. It's the reason why you must choose a good broker (Fidelity for example). Bad broker use dark pool to broke the retailer power and play against you."
2021-04-30 01:45:34,wallstreetbets,I don't know the specifics but essentially some brokers are able to execute orders in a manner that doesn't have an effect on a stocks price.

2021-04-30 13:45:59,wallstreetbets,"None of this had anything to do with Robinhood.  He was talking about what would have happened if longs all simultaneously exercised their calls, which, since there were far more shares in play than actual shares existing, would have caused a chain of defaulting all through the financial system (which is also why that was never going to happen anyway).

In fact his proposed solution was for regulators to INCREASE margin requirements, which is exactly what forced Robinhood to halt buying.  In effect, he would like more brokers to have been forced to do what Robinhood did.

None of this matters though, as you can see from reading the comments here.  People want to believe they were screwed, and they are going to keep believing that no matter what the reality is."
2021-04-30 19:22:09,wallstreetbets,"That dude is ignorant and is just playing off the hype.

Again... Robinhood is not the only broker on the street. Plenty of brokers allowed to trade gme. I traded gme with fidelity.

I've seen plenty of short squeezes.. Even after gme. They all play out near the same."

Of course, the current one that is not finished seems set to become the undisputed greatest OP arc ever."
2021-04-30 12:37:05,wallstreetbets,"Hands down he‚Äôs stronger than luffy. 

Luffy almost died, zoro was not looking too good himself and took on ALL of luffy‚Äôs damage and fatigue in that scene.  He should of been dead 10x over.   Luffy had passed out but zoro kept standing.


Zoro spends almost all the pre-time skip arcs wounded or grievously wounded.     He gets his massive chest wound from mihawk and then  that wound gets reopened, he gets additional wounds throughout the arcs.  

And almost all of them are are from traps, sneak attacks/ self inflicted out of necessity.

Zoros style is a natural counter to luffy and both are supernovas.

They are essentially equals but zoro is the  hard counter to luffy.   Whiteout a devil fruit he holds his own and has accomplished the same things as luffy minus 1, and in some regards has done things more impressive.   

I‚Äôll leave it vague about post-time skip/ new stuff.  But honestly it‚Äôs not that far fetched an idea that zoro -could- be stronger.  He doesn‚Äôt follow luffy because his stronger. He follows luffy for his determination and will.

(Counter point, zoro possibly maybe did something that definitively put luffy ahead, but simultaneously shows luffy only got ahead in the last 2 arcs) 

Not trying to rant or correct here:  just think that zoro is pretty insane and really well written.    

You get an inverse of luffyzoro with killerkidd  where you have two equally strong people but Kidd has a natural edge due to his abilities. And aside from  the magician and the mad monk(crazy fruit powers) those two are the supernovas I wanna see going all out the most."
2021-04-30 12:39:06,wallstreetbets,"I took those chapters as showing zoro was better,  but his actions just helped luffy  jump ahead.      

I think seeing zoro do ‚Äúthat thing‚Äù is what made things click for luffy and give him a chance."

If I‚Äôm being honest the people buying at $400 or whatever on Jan 27th/28th were right. They would have made profit or atleast had the chance to make profit because the price was going to sky rocket past 500 a share until brokerages limited buys.

2021-04-30 03:18:07,wallstreetbets,"**This is a simplification, but gives and idea of how trades like this work**

Prices move based on supply and demand at the current price. If the price is $180, it doesn't mean that there are an unlimited number of shares available at that price. If someone wants to order 50,000 shares, they will get all the ones being offered at $180, then $180.01, $180.02 etc all the way up. The price will keep going up until they either get their 50,000 shares or the price goes higher than the order maximum.

The price remains at a given point until the supply or demand at that price is exhausted. If the supply runs out at a given point before the demand, the price goes up (and vice versa)

That is how regular market sales work.

'Dark pool' block trades though are between 2 parties who mutually agree to trade a fixed number of shares for a fixed price. There's no change to the market price because there's no order there that is exhausting supply at the current price. A single block of shares are all agreed to be sold at the same price and so supply = demand. When supply equals demand, there's no price change."
2021-04-30 07:48:53,wallstreetbets,"Yes, because big money was like ""oh shit this might scare people"" and bailed. They were controlling the narrative the entire time. Robinhood traders refused to sell the entire time, and it dropped anyway, which is evidence that they were never really in control. If robinhooders and WSBers held as it went from $500 to $120, then that means that big money was responsible for much of the valuation above $120. And they were also responsible for the big drop.

Like I said, I 100% agree it hurt sentiment, and likely caused a selloff. But it was causing a big money selloff, not a retail selloff. Which clashes with this theory that retailer traders like you and I were causing the rally. We were just along for the ride.

Anyway, the robinhood thing  definitely didn't cause the sustained drop for weeks and weeks, and it definitely didn't 100% prevent this mythical short squeeze to $5,000 or whatever. If that was going to happen, it would've happened even if Robinhood pulled a fast one for a day or two there.

What really happened is that hedge funds were pushing us along, encouraging us, and boosting the stock up with their own money (and ours). When a hint of bad news hit, they bailed. If it wasn't the robinhood thing, it would've been something else. It was always a ticking time bomb created by big money, and not *actually* some legendary tale of retail single-handedly moving a stock to the moon."

2021-04-30 19:52:21,wallstreetbets,"Currently just finished the Zou arc, that sounds great!!"
2021-04-30 15:46:40,wallstreetbets,"Gotta disagree here.

I don't think Luffy ""almost died"" on Thriller Bark, in terms of how close he was to losing his last HP or whatever. He was beat from taking on the shadows and fighting Oars and Moria, yes, but it wasn't beyond anything else he's been through. Not particularly worse than after fighting Lucci. Certainly not as bad as after fighting Magellan. 

And while Zoro said ""nothing at all,"" it wasn't like he took that and was unfazed. Luffy had no reason to try to stoically remain standing after the fight; I don't see that as an indication that one withstood it better than the other. Not to mention, I question the extent of Kuma's ability in this context; I doubt it can really heal all wounds, like Mansherry can. Pain and fatigue isn't necessarily the same thing as misplaced or destroyed tissue. Zoro's grit enabled him to withstand that pain and fatigue all at once, which was impressive, but that's not the same thing as physical damage. Which he can obviously tank too, don't get me wrong; I'm just saying that Luffy's participation in the preceding fight was not exactly equivalent to Zoro's receiving Kuma's transfer.

Zoro beating Hatchan after being struck down by Mihawk was impressive, yes, but after that I don't think he gets credit for fighting while wounded. For one, it was never so bad, and for another...he's the one who kept getting wounded. And it's not like Luffy wasn't doing the same thing. ANd swords aren't really a special counter to Luffy; they work on him like they do on anybody. Almost every opponent Luffy has fought has used some sort of edged weapon against him.

Anyways, as to recent stuff: Luffy currently has a better mastery of Conqueror haki stuff, both in its normal area blast use and applied physically. He's using it at will. Maybe Zoro could imbue his attacks with it at will after this, having done it once, but for now Luffy has the advantage. Moreover, Luffy has mastered precognition observation haki, which Zoro simply hasn't.

Also, Luffy has better depth perception and poison tolerance, if we're gonna include everything lol"
2021-04-30 12:55:20,wallstreetbets,nah it was getting beat by kaido doing ‚Äúthat thing‚Äù and the fact that luffy already used that ‚Äúthing thing‚Äù consciously while for zoro it‚Äôs an ‚Äúultimate move‚Äù because he doesn‚Äôt realize he can use the same *haki* as luffy

Let me ask you something right now what is your prediction 5x 10x? Do you know it‚Äôs market cap? Now do math that would put its market in the same range as huge profitable business such as target McDonald, Lowe‚Äôs etc. You think GameStop has fundamentals as company to be as profitable as McDonald‚Äôs? Target? That means for its stock to sustainable at those levels they better be matching targets sales, how many people shop at target on the daily or buy Big Macs a day? How many video game products will they be able sell, oh wait the market as already saturated with online gaming services l you think everyone is going flock from steam, stop buying games from Amazon?

My investments include GME and are also diversified amongst several hydrogen coalition stocks and space tourism stocks as well as a majority chunk of it in a large zero market cap index fund; being a part-time produce clerk at a grocery store myself right now while I‚Äôm currently going to University for Psychology and later for Clinical Psychology, I can only afford to do fractionals for the individual stocks with a quarter of half of my weekly paychecks, so I only currently have about 5% of one share of GME, but I sincerely hope you‚Äôre right, that would mean a nearly 7,000,000% profit marginal return for me tbh."

2021-04-30 06:46:33,wallstreetbets,"the peak prices are going to depend on three things:

1. actual SI (just how deep the shorts dug the hole)
2. how much people sell on the way up to the peak (more sells, lower peak; fewer sells, higher peak)
3. intervention by the DTCC, SEC, or whoever else (widely considered illegal, but why would that stop them now?)

so $10M+ prices might be possible but it will not just happen on its own. the actual SI has to be higher than the rate of selling before the price reaches $10M and beyond. and then the power players/referees (#3) have to not step in and stop the game before the clock runs out. this is a gross oversimplification but i do believe these to be the three primary factors based on everything i‚Äôve read.

The most imminent catalyst is the approval of sailing from CDC. Commentaries from earnings will matter too. The cruise names trade on forward booking yield which sell-side tracks closely. This metric should trend favorably starting in 3Q through next year. Like other consumer cyclicals, this kind of measurable metric should help momentum.

The risk to this play is dilution like you guys mentioned. But I think the risk/reward is attractive from here."
2021-04-29 23:33:38,wallstreetbets,NCLH was trading at $60 pre-covid so OP basically has it for 50% off. I think NCLH will hit pre-Covid prices this year as the market continues to melt up.

I calculculated  2019: stocks- 237 million \* 48 ‚Ç¨ = 11.376 m ‚Ç¨ Now: stocks - 370 million \* 25 ‚Ç¨ = 9.250 m ‚Ç¨

But market cap is not the only thing you have to keep in mind."
2021-04-29 23:39:12,wallstreetbets,"BA is my long game. Keeping that until $325, predicting that sale will my Christmas fun money."
2021-04-30 16:36:11,wallstreetbets,What about napping Ted?
2021-04-29 23:21:18,wallstreetbets,"I upvoted you but it's totally ok to call this a YOLO BECAUSE IT'S A FUCKING HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE STOCK!

One you get big dollars in a stock, it can be a YOLO too!

(Also their earnings is in two weeks)"
2021-04-29 22:36:27,wallstreetbets,Sitting on 12.20ü§û
2021-04-30 06:39:50,wallstreetbets,"You mean it's just shares? When you say stocks that makes it sound like different companies, it's the wrong term is what I'm trying to say. It makes you sound foreign or like you literally learned about equities 5 minutes earlier."
2021-04-30 10:19:25,wallstreetbets,"Play the volatility. A large chunk of my portfolio is in these 3 (I got in right after COVID hit). About half of my investment is long-term, but the other half I've used to play the ups and downs constantly, and it's been very lucrative so far. It's likely that there's still a lot of room for these stocks to grow in the coming months, so I feel very safe buying every time there's a dip."
2021-04-29 23:42:34,wallstreetbets,They've issued tens of millions of shares since COVID hit.
2021-04-29 23:48:47,wallstreetbets,Mcap bro. NCLH is actually trading above precovid rn.
2021-04-30 06:42:21,wallstreetbets,"Bro you couldn't look less informed with this ridiculous comment. You're comparing market caps but keeping share count the same, but it isn't"
2021-04-30 00:02:49,wallstreetbets,What about the fact that confining people to an enclosed space on the tail winds of an airborne respiratory virus may not be a good thing? I hope this works out for you. It‚Äôs an interesting play. American are desperate to travel right now so I could see this possibly being successful but idk. Why are you so bullish?
2021-04-30 10:08:12,wallstreetbets,Dilutions or delusions?
2021-04-29 23:31:27,wallstreetbets,"Okay, conceding to you point, that‚Äôs a shitload of money on a company that has made a living out of losing money for over a year.

As for earning, I am at a loss for the how this works‚Ä¶ Big tech makes literal Ducktales Scrooge McDuck style piles of cash, they sink 3-5%. Cruise looses a billion+, they go up? (There is a boat pun in here somewhere).

I play stupid but opening admit to holding $6k worth of 9/17 45c and hope this goes just as questioned."
2021-04-29 22:38:32,wallstreetbets,My biggest regret is not understanding calls back then and going full in with the added leverage.
2021-04-30 05:41:24,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, sooo diluted. Same with CCL. I just got out because not only are cruise line stocks diluted, they've literally scrapped a decent portion of their revenue stream and they're still trading within 50-60% of pre-covid price"
2021-04-30 19:43:30,wallstreetbets,Doesn‚Äôt matter because they all did it and bunch of other companies in the travel and leisure sector did too. Cruise lines will smash their year-over-year comps and there are not enough places to put money to get good growth right now. NCLH will absolutely hit $60 within the next 12 months unless something happens with these Covid variants.
2021-04-30 19:37:14,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think market cap matters right now. Too much money has been printed for fundamental analysis to be done the same way as pre-Covid. Also who are they being compared to? RCL and CCL both diluted heavily as well. Right now investors are looking for growth opportunities and there are not many options out there that will produce better year over year comparative returns than the cruise lines ones they start sailing again, which should be this year. Lots of pent up demand and full savings accounts are going to keep boats full"
2021-04-30 19:56:42,wallstreetbets,"Share price and market cap are obviously related, but share price is much more influential. Even after dilution stock prices tend to gravitate towards previously established price levels. Market cap is pretty much ignored. If you‚Äôre so smart how about you say where NCLH is going and we see who is right? It‚Äôs really easy to say someone else‚Äôs perspective is wrong, but you‚Äôre the ridiculous one for trying (unsuccessfully) to attack my point of view without offering one of your own."
2021-04-30 00:36:05,wallstreetbets,Travel for sure but 0% chance I'd go on a cruise after this. Gross.
2021-04-30 05:21:52,wallstreetbets,"covid is on the way out now, absolutely no difference to being on a cruise ship to being at a music concert, restaurant, hotel etc the stock market always overdoes the fear of these temporary events, as long as a company can stay afloat (pun intended) into the recovery it can only go up afterwards"
2021-04-30 08:45:43,wallstreetbets,"Half of Americans don‚Äôt even think COVID is real, why wouldn‚Äôt you buy cruise lines?"
2021-04-30 07:03:56,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not OP
2021-04-30 10:24:08,wallstreetbets,Dilutions
2021-04-30 04:27:05,wallstreetbets,A brrrr-ing printer raises all ships?
2021-04-30 08:20:50,wallstreetbets,More than likely you weren't part of the mouth breathing demographic who would hop on a cruise pre pandemic.  The people who take cruises are the types who would take cruises during a pandemic and this is evidenced by all of the morons who were stuck on boats last year.  I'd be long cruise lines for the simple fact that morons can't wait to hop on party boats together again.
2021-04-30 10:08:36,wallstreetbets,Pandemic taught me one thing: People don't wash their hands.
2021-04-30 00:39:13,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm with you but at the same time, these airborne respiratory illnesses are gonna be with us for a minute. Maybe cruise lines show us how to live with them? Maybe OP knows something we don‚Äôt...."
2021-04-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Suncor (SU) update. Earning Monday evening. Hopefully it‚Äôs tendies for breakfast Tuesday morning.

2021-04-29 23:01:49,wallstreetbets,Wall Street overlooking oil majors in general. SU will beat earnings but I doubt it will move. People would rather buy over valued tech stocks.

2021-04-29 23:42:48,wallstreetbets,Yea dude I went in on this with you. I‚Äôm getting my ass jack hammered rn.
2021-04-30 10:09:11,wallstreetbets,"What I like about Suncor is that it's tied to the Canadian dollar. So it's cheap when CAD is down, but when CAD goes up SU also goes up. CAD sitting at $0.81 right now. TSX is heavily weighted in energy. When the pandemic hit CAD went down $0.61"
2021-04-29 23:10:33,wallstreetbets,"I fear you are right but it has been moving with oil and if oil goes higher we will see higher oil majors. The other catalysts for SU could be stock buybacks and dividend increases. If they do both, with high oil prices making news I think we will be in good shape."
2021-04-29 22:48:48,wallstreetbets,180@25.78.... like the long game

2021-04-30 03:28:47,wallstreetbets,"Why would they do that when they are still not back to pre-covid production levels, revenue or profits?"
2021-04-30 14:35:40,wallstreetbets,"They will be back almost at pre-covid revenue, likely this quarter, and likely going at full pace by 2022."

what happened? thought weed got more legalized in more states?"
2021-04-30 07:37:24,wallstreetbets, Been there for the cse and the start of it all just dying slowly. Surely but slowly. If madmen couldn't do it with there locations and customer base no one can. Have to be pulling 25k revenue a day easy. With close to 40% margins. Weed business isn't stock business
2021-04-30 07:56:13,wallstreetbets,"I think the key to profitability for Cannabis companies is going to be the kind of diversification that takes away sole reliance on cannabis itself. Take Agrify (AGFY), for example. It participates in cannabis/hemp cultivation, but does so while developing equipment and information solutions for indoor growth and agriculture as a whole, a huge future market... This and its market cap is $238 million vs. $3.34 billion."

No kidding you could do better your first time. It's that bad. Tilray is like a weed dealer in the 2000s this what we got want it or what. We have really good weed in canada better than los Angeles and no one is buying tweed , Tilray or apharia products. And it's known throughout canada by instagram posts of the garbage weed by these three companies."

2021-04-29 22:23:38,wallstreetbets,This merger is already priced in and Aphria stockholders will own 62.1% it's a takeover of tillray not the other way around the board will be primarily made op of Aphria guys. If anything we could see a price drop. It's run up nearly 14% this past week because of this merger vote. Just be careful is all I'm saying.
2021-04-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Yolo'd 230k into $MNMD while on Shrooms.

2021-04-29 20:16:04,wallstreetbets,"With 250k I would buy a house and do as much shrooms as possible while laying on an empty room tripping balls. 

But making more money works I guess"
2021-04-29 20:00:27,wallstreetbets,This is the way more than any other way
2021-04-29 20:52:59,wallstreetbets,This isn't real and you're just sitting sitting naked at the park staring into a box.
2021-04-29 20:02:12,wallstreetbets,"Ngl this makes sense, especially off shrooms"

2021-04-29 21:43:05,wallstreetbets,"I want to get a couple hundred shares of MNMD. But I‚Äôm wondering if we‚Äôre in the middle of hype that will die down and we‚Äôll consequently see a dip in the stock price as well. We‚Äôre still pretty far off from seeing progress and profit that I wonder if we‚Äôll get bored in the short term. This is clearly a LONG hold. Then again, maybe getting it for $4.50 a share vs $2.00 isn‚Äôt such a big difference in the long term."
2021-04-29 20:14:05,wallstreetbets,"Gonna yolo my $10G, tomorrow morning,  shrooms can't go wrong,  Hold Ape! Never sell low"
2021-04-29 21:34:18,wallstreetbets,Shroom sector is my favourite.  When you make money on something so uplifting there is no ill feelings.  Also when you are down the shrooms heal your depression.  Hands are strong like the shroom neurons.

Plus posts like these."
2021-04-29 22:14:11,wallstreetbets,Fucking moron
2021-04-30 00:21:50,wallstreetbets,Wrong one. No way psychedelics are going to be legalized any time soon. Can you imagine everyone tripping for 12 hours under the disguise of ‚Äúhelps with mental illness‚Äù? Read about $BETRF. They are on to something. No trip but all the benefits of LSD. No Schedule 1 to deal with. Impressive.
2021-04-29 21:48:45,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt understand these kind of stock buys....makes 0 sense but do what you gotta do

2021-04-29 21:20:48,wallstreetbets,It's a great investment if you believe in the medicine. But you gotta be realistic. Psychedelics are unpredictable by nature. All it takes is one bad trip and the stock will drop.
2021-04-29 21:21:13,wallstreetbets,That looks like a bad trip!
2021-04-29 21:42:06,wallstreetbets,Ouch

2021-04-29 22:20:39,wallstreetbets,"coming from someone who loves psychedelics, that's such a poor stock. It may still go up for you, but I don't see companies like that really integrating for another 2 or 3 decades minimum. Still so much stigma and negativity around them with the average joe. People just aren't ready for the TRUTH of LIFE. Perhaps if we keep feeding Gen Z vapes and then use mushrooms to help them kick the addiction the new era will wise up...just a thought"

2021-04-30 05:19:25,wallstreetbets,I think I've come to the conclusion that r/wallstreetbets is a playground for rich kids who's parents didn't teach them the value of money.

2021-04-29 22:53:56,wallstreetbets,"I honestly think hedge funds are trading off WSB pages now, setting small amounts of capital to the side just strictly to play the meme game. Losing 250K is nothing to these assholes."

2021-04-30 08:24:16,wallstreetbets,"When you see bets like this, these people simply have tons of disposable income. They ain't working 9-5 engineer jobs and bringing in 200k a year.

2021-04-29 23:12:20,wallstreetbets,exactly lol. I honestly don't understand how some of these tech bros do psychedelics and don't realize the obsurdity of the wealth they chase
2021-04-30 00:14:35,wallstreetbets,"Just go outside when the stars are out and witness the infinite beauty. Only when you can actually feel how much there is left to see, do, and invent and how little time you have in this life to push humanity towards the good end can you be mildly existential crisis resistant.      
     
Does it really matter? Not particularly. But since you're already isekai'd here you might as well help out ‚ú®üêµ‚ú®"
2021-04-29 20:32:59,wallstreetbets,maybe it wasn‚Äôt that bad since they were on shrooms
2021-04-29 23:53:19,wallstreetbets,I turn my phone the fuck off when I trip
2021-04-29 22:32:02,wallstreetbets,The numbers are opportunities for complete freedom. That is why we are a slaves to the numbers.
2021-04-29 22:47:00,wallstreetbets,THE NUMBERS MUSHROOMS. WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN.
2021-04-29 23:12:32,wallstreetbets,This was my first thought too. Shrooms are for enjoying the things in life that are free n beautiful. But to each their own!!
2021-04-29 23:02:05,wallstreetbets,word this post is actually pretty dark
2021-04-29 23:20:42,wallstreetbets,ü§£ This is the real caveat here

2021-04-30 00:32:27,wallstreetbets,Duude I can totally relate. Anything on my eye sight can cause existential crisis when I was high on shrooms
2021-04-30 02:02:28,wallstreetbets,as you're drifting away from your body. then everything zooms back into focus and your whole train of thought switches gears

2021-04-30 00:17:30,wallstreetbets,God damn I don't even let myself go near a computer when I'm tripping.  I've got a 100% chance of stupidity and regret.
2021-04-29 21:16:39,wallstreetbets,"See, you needed that cry. Shrooms showed you the way.

And I've totally had to drop trou and take a shit in a park because of shrooms before. I also feel like I'm peeing myself, just a little bit, the whole trip.

Worth it to properly remember an old pet."

* they have no expected revenue for the next 5 years
* plenty of other companies are doing the same thing
* FDA hurdles/their product is based on a Schedule I drug"
2021-04-30 10:46:18,wallstreetbets,"I have never understood this mentality. If you think it's gonna go to $10 or so, why does 4.50 vs 2.50 matter? Buy now. If it dips, you get the chance to average down into a larger position."
2021-04-30 14:38:19,wallstreetbets,"It's gonna live and die by trial results. Psychedelics have already proven successful for treating mental illness, they're just jumping through the hoops necessary to bring these things to market. They also use these for EOL treatments for people with cancer and in hospice. So it'll likely drop before it launches, but I'm optimistic. Similar to pot stocks, but without the bloat and snake oil salesmen trying to talk people into skin creams etc. At least not yet."

2021-04-29 22:00:41,wallstreetbets,If anything shrooms increase your productivity and speed up neural connections.  And the effect can be permanent and occur outside of while you're actually on them. Look into neuroplasticity and shroom relation.

2021-04-29 22:17:09,wallstreetbets,"I saw the future on DMT once.....first time actually.  I am quite interested in the similar experiences people will officially report.  I like what Foli Deux(sp) in Terrance McKenna's books reps shared madness while they were on mushrooms.  That aspect is amazing to me such as candflipping at a fest in recreational terms.  But the idea of the remote viewing, seeing similar uhhh things between unrelated people.  I likened what i witnessed to Krsna revealing his true form to Arjuna.  Artistically look at Tool and Alex Greys artwork to have a visual representation and how that theme is repeated in art across the world.  The one thing that connects them is a source of similar acting substances related to Tryptamines.  The mushrooms to canary reed grass to ayahuasca and thats just in the americas.  You can look at the mold that grows on rye and other grains, look at the stories of witches what have you but that is what LSD was based off of.  We goin full 3 stigmata of Palmer Eldritch bitches."

- common for biotech, no revenue untill a drug is approved. Hence biotech being considered a risky sector 
- several drugs in the FDA trial pipeline, also diversified (LSD, MDMA, DMT)
- very true, however some states/cities/countries have decriminalized mushrooms, and there‚Äôs lots of (potential) patients outside the U.S."
2021-04-30 02:26:14,wallstreetbets,"Nah bro not all the compounds are schedule 1. Like 18-MC is similar to ibogaine but different. Mindmeds got a lot of different fda trials going on which gives them a lot safety through diversification. 

Some of the psych companies are doing similar things but a lot of it is different compounds. 

Yeah they‚Äôre years away from revenue but the market for mental health treatment is pretty big and the latest results from a lot of psychedelic studies are amazing. 

I don‚Äôt think all the companies are great investments but mindmed one of the better ones imo and they‚Äôre are others too."

2021-04-29 21:47:39,wallstreetbets,"Once I started making six figures and was around a lot of people making between $75k - $175k it was like suddenly everyone around me was doing drugs. Mushrooms, mdma, acid, coke, ketamine. Not all the time but every few months or so.

Before that when I was making like $20k there were a few people that would smoke weed on occasion but that was pretty much it.

More disposable income the more you‚Äôve got left over to spend on drugs, and to go to events that it‚Äôs acceptable to be on drugs. Also when you‚Äôre working an office job with low/no risk of getting tested unlike a service industry job that if you get in an accident you‚Äôre tested immediately it makes it easier."

2021-04-29 21:23:57,wallstreetbets,"No? He was on shrooms and under the influence of drugs. That makes the contract voidable. 

Perfect legal defence if you want to enter into high risk trades. Used to be a well kept secret here on wsb but I guess the cat is out of the bag now. 

The trick is to have a witness or record it so that you have evidence if you land in court. 

Not legal advice by the way.

Edit: can‚Äôt believe i have to say it. Use your brains people. Do you really think any contract can be voided by taking drugs before entering into it? If you made up your mind before taking them the defence doesn‚Äôt work, you had the intent to buy those stocks. What do I know though, I‚Äôm just a cat with a keyboard who can‚Äôt provide legal advice."

2021-04-30 00:05:49,wallstreetbets,You'd be surprised. Found out today 2 of my coworkers (we make close to 6 fig) didn't know how tax brackets worked after one of them said he might not take a raise because it'll cost him more. I thought it was a meme that people didn't understand it.
2021-04-30 00:17:19,wallstreetbets,I mean maybe he does understand how they work‚Ä¶ he never said anything that implied he didnt. I was just throwin a tip out there for anyone curious. Maybe he just doesnt wanna pay 22% on ANYTHING.
2021-04-30 00:09:13,wallstreetbets,"I think this case is different. Earned money needs to get taxed. Invested money can sit there and grow, so getting taxed more on any dollar is a bigger loss. Can totally see myself making that justification for only withdrawing a certain amount."

2021-04-30 01:20:44,wallstreetbets,"Could be doing it for tax credit and planning purposes.  Yes, he can take more money, but taxes can change to be more favorable (or worse) in the future and he feels like only giving the government 12% and letting the rest stay invested.  I'd say it probably will be more applicable to people who have the potential 1 million investment income with the upcoming potential capital gains changes."
2021-04-30 02:23:39,wallstreetbets,"He's right to do so though. Let's say he has 80k on the market, if he takes it all now 40k are taxed at 12% and 40k at 22%. But if he takes 40k this year and 40k next year, then all of it is taxed at only 12%. On top of that, if he leave 40k on the market for one more year, it will keep growing.

If he doesn't need the money then it would cost him more to withdraw it all at once."

2021-04-30 04:09:50,wallstreetbets,"That was an ironic statement about how many people argue, i just inverted it.

Listen: just because white males are present in beeing rich, this doesnt imply that white males are privileged. Did eminem have privilege in his trailerpark? Certainly not yet he became rich, as 50 cent did.

Do black kids with rich parents have privilege? Yes. Why call it white privilege if its rich privilege... Demographic changes need time and sooner or later will even out. To talk of white privilege is as racist as stating black males cant amount to nothing. Both isnt true and makes white poor people look even worse and they get judged easy cause: they had ""privilege"" and still didnt do it.

Fact is most rich people had rich parents or worked hard/smart. One is privilege the other is intelligence and work ethic. Nothing about colour so stop bringing it in the discussion. For claiming to  fight against racism these people talk a lot about colour of skin."

2021-04-30 10:34:43,wallstreetbets,"You don‚Äôt know what white privilege is. 

If 50 cent and Eminem both out on jeans and a tshirt, and go to Martha‚Äôs Vinyard, it doesn‚Äôt matter if they were previously in shitty situations, Eminem‚Äôs whiteness would still give him an advantage.

There are plenty of poor white people that have a shitty/hard life. White privilege doesn‚Äôt mean all whiten people have it easy, it means that overall their whiteness protects them while blackness makes others a target for discrimination."
2021-04-30 04:44:54,wallstreetbets,"When someone calls a statistic like ""50 13"" racist they aren't calling the statistic racist. They are attacking the implications of the statement that black people are a barbaric race that deserves to be held in contempt for their frequent criminal acts. Do African Americans commit 50 percent of *reported* crimes? Yes, but there are several reasons why. Reasons include: African American crimes are significantly more likely to be reported by the police, African Americans are taught during the first day of school that their culture is wrong and the separation they must make between professionalism and their way of life can lead to them disconnecting from White society, and slavery without repetitions has lead to a wide wealth gap. The logic used against the ""50 13"" argument can not be applied to saying white people as a group are richer than other demographics. There is no underlying reasoning to label the implications of the fact as disingenuous.

Obviously not all white people are rich, just as not all black people are poor. You are right to say that some individuals have not reaped the financial benefits of the systemic racism in America, however we are talking about White men as a whole and not individuals. Is it fair to label your or I as rich and white based on commenting on this subreddit? No, but it is fair to estimate that a large proportion of this subreddit is rich and white based on wealth shown. 

There is an argument to be made that a portion of Eminem's success can be attributed to white privelege despite growing up poor. That more people listened to him because he gave a white perspective that can not be given from a black man. Another instance of musical success that people attribute to white privelege was Macklemore winning the Grammy over Kendrick Lamar. I'm not saying that Kendrick's album was objectively better but a large majority hold it subjectively higher. We have to question why some of the best selling albums of a music genre, where a vast majority of artists are African Americans, were made by a white man, Eminem.

I know you might not be entirely receptive to my arguments but I hope someone reading might be."

&#x200B;

You noticed right?

&#x200B;

White rich people is a historic thing and not systematic racism. Systematic racism is slowly decreasing, however to remove social and ghetto factors takes patience, carefull judgements and again time. To rush things is just repeating the same shit with different people.

&#x200B;

The solution is to slowly mix and decrease size of ghettos, however no one wants to live in an area you get shot for being white, or beware a cop. Its not exactly the fault of the ghettopeople, thats just how it is at the moment. It is a long time solution.

&#x200B;

The same thing is to be applied for females in leading positions. Otherwhise soon white men will do gangster hip hop and will amount to 99% of crime despite beeing like 60-75% of population.

2021-04-30 02:34:57,wallstreetbets,Is there any hope for the stock to break 20$ in the next few weeks? I bought in at around 19$. I heard some talk about a short squeeze but it doesn‚Äôt sound likely. I think my only hope is holding for the long term. the company seems to have a good product and with the rising interest in autonomous driving i don‚Äôt see why it would go down drastically.

2021-04-30 05:16:17,wallstreetbets,"Old people like naps.  Naps are cool. I've noodled around with this thing for a few days and done okay.  So yesterday I've got about 3,000 shares just under $18/share and I get sleepy.  I always put in a sale order just in case.  Sell $19.15.  Then I crashed. (just had second vaccine shot) Slept late, woke up about 4:14 , took a look and...WTF I wasn't the only thing that crashed.  Then...

I look at the broker and see they all got taken out at $19.15.  Moral of the story?...naps are VERY cool and always keep a balance order in place.

Edit:  Now about this PLTR thing.  WTF?"
2021-04-30 06:10:24,wallstreetbets,I made $1300

2021-04-30 15:48:54,wallstreetbets,"First time: Microvision wrote about ""negotiations"" in Q1 PR. Plural. WEEKS before in Q4 PR only ""exploring""! Sale of company soon! PR indicates MULTIPLE interested parties to buy at > $20 (price at time of PR)

Post below copied from ST. **I can confirm it!** Completely overseen the **change in wording**. In the past they were only in discussions and so on. **Last status** before PR only **weeks ago** was ""exploring"".

Some weeks ago in March in the Q4 PR it was:

>**exploring** strategic alternatives

**Now** it is:

>**negotiate** with potential strategic partners

&#x200B;

I would add in addition to Chris, it changed during the few weeks also from

>**alternatives**

to **now**

>**partners**

&#x200B;

Chris pointed also out that it is **plural**, so that there are > 1 possible parties interested in buying at the share price level at the time of the CC, so at > $20.

Buyout was never sooner and likelier than now, Closing likely soon.

2021-04-29 23:09:11,wallstreetbets,Either sell and accept your loss or potential take a worse beating tomorrow ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2021-04-30 03:30:42,wallstreetbets,Same I may buy more out of spite
2021-04-30 01:43:25,wallstreetbets,We are the same lol. Thought I was sly buying that big dip at 20.5-22$ luckily it was only 30 shares and I sold 10 of them at 19.50$
2021-04-29 23:28:28,wallstreetbets,*would have
2021-04-30 18:37:19,wallstreetbets,"Set up a stop loss bro. I do the same thing, but if it shoots up a lot, I just put a stop loss that I'm comfortable cashing out a profit in and forget it. If it keeps going up, I just readjust it higher and higher, but rarely do I adjust it lower and lower. 

You can also use a trailing stop loss if that's your thing, that way you don't have to continuously monitor it."
2021-04-30 03:18:20,wallstreetbets,Hope you're right! will keep a close eye on MVIS today.
2021-04-30 01:42:19,wallstreetbets,If he did he would have matched the companies pathetic revenue.
2021-04-29 20:50:53,wallstreetbets,"Haha I‚Äôm in a similar boat! I bought MVIS at $10.65 after I saw the post about Cramer last Tuesday and then averaged up to $12. Sold it for $25.75 and made 35k. But like a absolute moron, I bought CLOV this morning at $11.10 with my MVIS tendies RIP"
2021-04-30 03:37:37,wallstreetbets,CLOV isn‚Äôt over yet!
2021-04-29 23:25:48,wallstreetbets,Guh
2021-04-30 05:43:27,wallstreetbets,I waited for 30 on the 30th... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è let‚Äôs see where it goes üöÄ
2021-04-29 20:12:25,wallstreetbets,"Do you? That shit is donzo, my guy. Go look at the chart. it got absolutely shat on AH, lol. It's over."
2021-04-30 01:09:46,wallstreetbets,It's going to be a blood bath...
2021-04-30 01:54:26,wallstreetbets,Hold
2021-04-29 23:26:20,wallstreetbets,Why? They literally sell nothing. Since 1993
2021-04-29 23:54:38,wallstreetbets,"52 wk low was around 23cents... if I remember correctly. So from $14 to $0.23, yeah, can get a lot worse..."
2021-04-30 09:37:42,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm holding my 300 shares @22 ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
2021-04-29 22:10:41,wallstreetbets,"Managed to listen during work and you could tell they couldn‚Äôt talk about the specifics of a ‚Äúpartner‚Äù. While it could‚Äôve been hot air, they have a dedicated investor group that‚Äôs heavily involved, so it‚Äôs likely the building blocks are in place. May not show due to the other reddit for the investors. Just search the name. I do not know why it out it here reddit why you do weird things to me? I did not consent..."
2021-04-29 21:03:18,wallstreetbets,Panic selling because of earnings. Somehow people missed the memo that this is a more long term play
2021-04-30 00:41:50,wallstreetbets,Do you own OptionTimings newsletter?
2021-04-29 23:15:34,wallstreetbets,This is not my 1st rodeo.
2021-04-30 10:25:02,wallstreetbets,">For me, it's back in the $10-$11 range."
2021-04-30 03:33:24,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service.
2021-04-30 09:46:56,wallstreetbets,"I bought more too haha. It's going back up, maybe?"
2021-04-30 12:00:56,wallstreetbets,Thank you! I wish you luck as well
2021-04-30 14:33:47,wallstreetbets,I timed the buy when it's almost the lowest and the sell when it's almost the highest. Check $MVIS monthly chart and compare it to my buy and sell timing.
2021-04-29 20:16:03,wallstreetbets,You belong here.
2021-04-30 17:34:16,wallstreetbets,I will. You know you're making profits when you have to pay taxes.
2021-04-29 20:04:02,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs what I get for fomoing
2021-04-29 21:30:11,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm down like 50 on 6 shares I‚Äôm gonna guess I‚Äôm holding these bitches for at least 3-4 months now.
2021-04-30 15:40:02,wallstreetbets,MVIS always goes down for a bit after their quarterly financial report gets released. It will go back up. It always shows that they're not making money but their laser projections and LIDAR are in demand. Just wait until someone buys MVIS ü§ë
2021-04-30 04:45:04,wallstreetbets,"Give it some time bud, itll find its way back up but it might take a little bit"
2021-04-29 23:17:17,wallstreetbets,If I told you I expected 14.00 would you believe me? Truth. Hoping is never a good thing in the market.
2021-04-29 22:25:46,wallstreetbets,"So if you bought at 29, then you only have another thousand to lose.  If you bought closer... You can still walk away with most of your money.

Discretion is the better part of valor."
2021-04-29 23:39:27,wallstreetbets,"Hey, me too! üòÇ"
2021-04-30 01:02:53,wallstreetbets,"Likely drill down for pre market and first hour, shorts accelerating the drop. Sub 10 I reckon, with a modest recovery eod."
2021-04-30 02:18:21,wallstreetbets,"Think like Caesar, my fellow ape... tomorrow is just one battle we can afford to lose, the time will come when we win the war!"
2021-04-30 09:15:09,wallstreetbets,Me too! üò™ maybe by monday it will be back up. Damn quarter review
2021-04-30 03:12:14,wallstreetbets,"Bruh 7k today hurt my fucking soul.  Tomorrow will be better, although MVIS may not be where it‚Äôs at in the near"
2021-04-30 02:35:10,wallstreetbets,"If you are down 20K, then the most you can be down is 40K.  As they say, your downside risk is limited, but your upside is unlimited.  To be a bad-ass ape, go sell some covered calls so that your upside is limited too!  You will thank me for it."
2021-04-30 01:44:39,wallstreetbets,That more than my whole account.üò¨
2021-04-30 10:23:04,wallstreetbets,"I'm down around the same amount, and that's with some of my shares in the green when I bought low. Looks like MVIS and PLTR are going to be buddies in my account and sticking around for the long haul."
2021-04-29 22:50:06,wallstreetbets,What newsletter is that?
2021-04-29 23:38:02,wallstreetbets,I saw the call out for root. I knew I was risking it but thought there was still some room.
2021-04-30 00:19:05,wallstreetbets,I never pull out....probably why I got 6 kids
2021-04-29 20:37:01,wallstreetbets,Should have pulled out when it hit ATH
2021-04-29 23:06:42,wallstreetbets,"You should pull out and call it all over its face.

*This is not financial advice."
2021-04-29 20:38:18,wallstreetbets,Yes! Get out now.
2021-04-29 21:14:01,wallstreetbets,I would get out there earnings call was terrible gonna tank the bears are selling its what i did not telling you anything financial
2021-04-30 15:40:37,wallstreetbets,I'd hold. Or buy more. They'll go up
2021-04-30 14:49:00,wallstreetbets,Big fax
2021-04-30 02:23:04,wallstreetbets,i don't even want to look tomorrow.  i literally just got in at 17.94 early today
2021-04-30 14:51:45,wallstreetbets,Cause I‚Äôm big dumb
2021-04-30 01:37:24,wallstreetbets,20k for me üòì
2021-04-29 23:21:58,wallstreetbets,"$300, glad I only spent a g on it."
2021-04-30 19:51:47,wallstreetbets,I'm in. Where do I contribute?
2021-04-30 16:47:42,wallstreetbets,Down 3k . whats the recovery plan ?
2021-04-29 21:14:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I was pretty stoked, I went out and bought myself the 64 count box of üñç, snack drawer is lookin pre-tty sweeeet fellas!"
2021-04-30 00:13:34,wallstreetbets,I need to remember this... fuck me. I felt like a superhero for 24 hours. Now I‚Äôm a super retard for god knows how long.
2021-04-29 23:33:16,wallstreetbets,"I came from broke livin so I'm happy with modest gains sometimes, plus I'm pretty retarded,  but my wife's boyfriend gives great financial advice"
2021-04-30 07:46:06,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúWhen you feel like a prophet, take the profit.‚Äù"
2021-04-30 16:57:24,wallstreetbets,Mantra of the day.
2021-04-30 12:21:48,wallstreetbets,"Nice! You hit the peak with half, I missed it!"
2021-04-29 23:27:18,wallstreetbets,"Honestly right here from the ape gang! I read quite a bit on here, and then go and research the company, if I like the stock I buy it! I just got lucky is all, I read a dd about it, was interested and got in"
2021-04-29 21:35:57,wallstreetbets,"Learned that with GME. Sold at the top, bought a few more for insurance. Still made a good amount, but learned my lesson."
2021-04-29 20:51:27,wallstreetbets,I did.  Bought in at 16ish aold at 18ish made 400$  bought back in at 20 even added more at 22 but forgot to sell at 26 when I was up 3 grand. Now I'm bag holding ...no regerts
2021-04-29 20:48:42,wallstreetbets,Not for MVIS specifically. But this is a legitimate strategy in options trading. I rolled some CLNE calls and those are printing.
2021-04-29 20:49:08,wallstreetbets,Facts
2021-04-29 23:39:23,wallstreetbets,Can after 30 days to avoid wash sale right?
2021-04-29 22:14:35,wallstreetbets,Same shit with me and CLOV. Bought yesterday at the bell. Things went up. Today was up 24%  until it began to tank. I‚Äôm at -3%.
2021-04-29 23:40:32,wallstreetbets,MVIS YOLO today at 14.5 for 29 tomorrow
2021-04-29 21:04:58,wallstreetbets,CLOV might be a good hold in the mid-long term though. My calls expire in August so I‚Äôm just gonna wait it out
2021-04-29 23:09:19,wallstreetbets,"MVIS has spiked and dumped like 4 times since February. It's what the stock does.

Personally I'll rebuy when it gets back down to 10 and wait for the next ride."
2021-04-29 20:29:25,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs what the tutes that have been shorting it want you to think. They want your shares because they know they will become valuable so they short into retail volume to shake weak hands and then accumulate through dark pools. How many shares of Gme and AMC are dark pools accumulating?...
2021-04-29 23:55:45,wallstreetbets,So you're saying double down.
2021-04-29 22:18:27,wallstreetbets,Thanks! The app needs some work.
2021-04-29 21:32:50,wallstreetbets,Seriously. When they get bought out by Microsoft in the next few years it'll be great
2021-04-29 21:25:03,wallstreetbets,True. But at least the apes won some dough. Some a lot of dough lol
2021-04-29 21:28:03,wallstreetbets,"Sell covered calls when it spikes, iv was real nice."
2021-04-29 20:36:39,wallstreetbets,Never buy something when it‚Äôs going up. Buy when it‚Äôs going red. Get in before it‚Äôs good.
2021-04-30 00:49:12,wallstreetbets,We‚Äôve all done it. Hopefully that $500 wasn‚Äôt a huge amount for you. I‚Äôm glad I sat out on MVIS. I didn‚Äôt make any money but I also didn‚Äôt lose any. So technically a win?
2021-04-29 22:17:49,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I decided to double down on my calls today. Unfortunately I‚Äôm as stubborn as Marty McFly getting called a chicken and will be holding until they expire worthless in June. Only then will the stock explode and make you all cash."
2021-04-30 00:35:14,wallstreetbets,Yup decided this is a holding stock.
2021-04-30 18:29:30,wallstreetbets,Okay....they had me shaking in my knees.
2021-04-30 08:28:54,wallstreetbets,üíØüíØüíØ
2021-04-30 02:21:32,wallstreetbets,"Expect 14, expect 10, expect 20...volatility = opportunity"
2021-04-29 23:41:37,wallstreetbets,I made some change. Then bought for lower price.
2021-04-30 15:18:42,wallstreetbets,"From my understanding of this stock, it typically drops to the 10 dollar resistance before it bounces back to about 20 dollars. A long term hold on it can probably get your money back but it'll probably dip more before it recovers. Remember, it's done this over 4 times already before WSB even started talking about it."
2021-04-30 08:49:27,wallstreetbets,Great master where can I learn this thing called covered calls ( options trading )
2021-04-29 23:19:23,wallstreetbets,Your mom's bf runs it from his his tent in Tenderloin.
2021-04-30 02:25:24,wallstreetbets,"Pull out when she's high, never pull out when she's down... way to go, brother!"
2021-04-30 07:55:03,wallstreetbets,ATH is like 400$
2021-04-29 23:53:56,wallstreetbets,im taking that advice üòÇ
2021-04-30 11:19:31,wallstreetbets,To chesty is better
2021-04-29 21:50:16,wallstreetbets,yeah gotta learn from mistakes. im just a rookie ape
2021-04-30 00:00:48,wallstreetbets,Do you realize what their technology is and what‚Äôs capable? It‚Äôs a long term hold. It‚Äôs future
2021-04-30 03:42:12,wallstreetbets,"Same I bought 54 shares at $18, but bought 40 shares at $10. So should be interesting in the morning, might buy more."
2021-04-30 16:35:13,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-30 15:12:51,wallstreetbets,I'm up $3. I feel like Ralph Wiggum.
2021-04-30 01:22:17,wallstreetbets,Same here brother... same here...
2021-04-29 22:29:56,wallstreetbets,"Is that emoji a crayon or a flaming hot Cheeto? Both great snacks, nice job."
2021-04-29 23:21:35,wallstreetbets,"This is trading.  None of this ""I'm gonna buy and hold for $1000 bullshit."" MVIS is a penny turd. You gotta take the money when you got a profit."
2021-04-30 00:21:01,wallstreetbets,I am a glue guy myself. Nothing better than some Elmer's
2021-04-30 06:21:35,wallstreetbets,What color did you eat first?
2021-04-30 08:58:43,wallstreetbets,Haha same. I‚Äôll try not to forget next time.
2021-04-29 23:46:16,wallstreetbets,"You keep the gains bro. The hardest part is keeping a profit, Wall Street wants it back, they will lure you back in, just don‚Äôt fomo and be too greedy."
2021-04-30 00:22:06,wallstreetbets,My wife's boyfriend only gives me a rash
2021-04-30 00:05:42,wallstreetbets,Their lack of any revenue at all was enticing eh?
2021-04-29 21:38:25,wallstreetbets,"Did the same. I think it‚Äôs a fair play though.

Take your profits, but leave a little in to see if you can squeeze a bit more out. Not too bad. I wouldn‚Äôt buy more, i would just not sell everything.

You get your cake and a chance at a little more."
2021-04-29 20:53:50,wallstreetbets,User name checks out.
2021-04-29 21:18:59,wallstreetbets,Why even sell at 18 then? Either hold it or get out.
2021-04-29 21:17:24,wallstreetbets,Rolling is completely different
2021-04-29 23:15:55,wallstreetbets,$clov pop is tomorrow... Not today... :)
2021-04-29 21:22:08,wallstreetbets,Oh fuck... It's retarded
2021-04-29 21:21:28,wallstreetbets,"Bro, it just went from like what? $27 all the way down to $14 in a few days, you think that's just all shorting?? No way, lol. Just in AH it dropped $4. That's people pulling out. Taking some tendies while they can. It's a wrap. It's gonna be long time before anything like that happens again. Look at RKT. Same shit happened and bag holders are still waiting."
2021-04-30 00:13:57,wallstreetbets,You do you
2021-04-29 22:39:35,wallstreetbets,"But yeah, long odds are good, as much as it‚Äôs ‚Äúbag holding‚Äù. Though it‚Äôs much more confident than RKT which is pretty dead."
2021-04-29 21:42:50,wallstreetbets,"Let me speculate, what if apple buys them off for their EVs program? Certainly that would help the stock price"
2021-04-30 06:17:59,wallstreetbets,That gives me plenty of time to take the profits I made this week and buy all those .27 dips this dumpster fire of a business will see.
2021-04-29 21:29:51,wallstreetbets,Nice! Thanks for the tip.
2021-04-29 21:13:00,wallstreetbets,Get in so it dips more after you get in the dip lol seems about right
2021-04-30 04:57:00,wallstreetbets,Bought the dip but it kept on dippin
2021-04-30 07:44:04,wallstreetbets,This might be the worst stock advice I‚Äôve ever heard.
2021-04-30 13:29:45,wallstreetbets,THIS is the way
2021-04-30 16:04:12,wallstreetbets,"Wanted to upvote this comment, but stopped myself because it was at 69"
2021-04-30 09:24:00,wallstreetbets,"It helps if we are in the special group so we can get in 
Early too . Sheesh"
2021-04-30 10:04:10,wallstreetbets,"I did and it went redder!!

I guess it was a light red and should have waited for a deeper red!! üòÇ"
2021-04-30 00:58:01,wallstreetbets,"No, you were an observer in the audience. Those who played won and lost"
2021-04-30 01:11:02,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino. The free buffets are for those that play."
2021-04-30 01:15:23,wallstreetbets,Not a huge amount but still sucks. Last time I fomo into something.
2021-04-30 01:05:04,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget.. in the end Marty doesn't end up racing Needles. If he had he would have wrecked that Rolls Royce. 

There is hope for you yet."
2021-04-30 02:36:35,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately it would appear none of us have the sports almanac..
2021-04-30 00:58:46,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúAnd they all became long term investors that day‚Äù
2021-04-30 02:12:17,wallstreetbets,"No need to hold for long... MVIS' volatility is so high, any slightly good news will make it shot back up again."
2021-04-30 02:09:35,wallstreetbets,I ain‚Äôt decide shit I just buy what I see
2021-04-30 09:10:43,wallstreetbets,Youtube and /r/options.
2021-04-30 13:01:06,wallstreetbets,"I'm no master, just an ape warrior.  Learn about options online, and apply for an options account with your brokerage."
2021-04-30 10:01:07,wallstreetbets,Damn you‚Äôre right. I only looked back the past 5 years. ATH within the past 5 years i guess.
2021-04-30 04:08:20,wallstreetbets,Nah they will be back in the single digits again it hit its highs twice now the gig is up well that's what i believe i made enough money off it im happy with my gains that's why i got out plus i never intended the long haul just some quick hype money still holding GME for a while now even tho i don't think its gonna go higher after last nights speech people are gonna get out before huge tax loses all my stocks in red today and S&p up to all time highs wonder what's coming looking like 2008 again
2021-04-30 03:57:53,wallstreetbets,I bought in at 23.68. Then I heard about technical analysis. It‚Äôs a whole thing!
2021-04-30 04:12:50,wallstreetbets,no its not lol
2021-04-30 00:21:53,wallstreetbets,"Try dipping the yellows in a Lil Elmer's man, it'll change your life"
2021-04-29 23:59:12,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! Wait, is that you Chad???"
2021-04-30 00:09:26,wallstreetbets,"And like I said, I didn't know, I guessed, I'm not playing with big money yet, so it's not all that gnarly to take a gamble like that"
2021-04-30 00:08:10,wallstreetbets,"No, I just dug the tech, shit that is used for VR, AR, and obstacle detection in automated vehicles.  Seemed pretty solid to me, and hey, worked out didn't it?
Edit: Autonomous.... My bad"
2021-04-30 04:21:11,wallstreetbets,"everyone knew earnings would be bad, it was in the DD. this was a sell the news play if you weren't hanging tight for the buy out, or if you didnt mind taking profits and holding again when it went back down. some shorts covering only sweetened the deal.  


waiting for a good entry again, since this will happen again (most likely before a buy out)"
2021-04-29 21:48:39,wallstreetbets,Playing with house money üí∞ is always a fun ride.
2021-04-30 00:02:24,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm holding for sure
2021-04-29 21:19:40,wallstreetbets,"If I understand it correctly, its closing a position and then opening another on the same underlying. 

Feel free to correct me. I'm still pretty new to trading."
2021-04-29 21:27:02,wallstreetbets,"It was 10 like what, two weeks ago?"
2021-04-30 00:28:23,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve heard this story 6x now throughout the past year of my investment in mvis. It‚Äôs volatile because it‚Äôs speculative. But rewards are greater for success in speculative plays. I have done endless amounts of research into mvis and their verticals and tech and I am still all in. People love to hate on mvis after big drops but we consistently hit newer all time highs over and over. Luminar has a market cap of $8B and shit revenues as well but mvis confirmed it has a better product than them today by a significant margin! Looking to price action to guide your investment is silly. If I sold mvis every time it dumped 50% I‚Äôd have missed out on the run from $0.70 to $14 (now).
2021-04-29 21:56:15,wallstreetbets,"Possibly though with MVIS there‚Äôs likelihood of a buyout whereas as RKT is more up in the air. Hindenburg admitted to heavily shorting back in December when it was $6, so his point has some merit."
2021-04-29 23:27:03,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs hilarious. Ever since GME the only reason a stock can go down according to these idiots is because of ‚Äúthe shorts‚Äù.

‚ÄúI never lost money buying a stock on the way up.‚Äù 

That‚Äôs because he has diamond fucking hands they would make ours look like glass, and because he does the DD and truly understand his own reasons for buying in.

I‚Äôm sure a lot of GME 450 bag holders would take serious fucking issue with this advice but remember two things:

1) he wasn‚Äôt referring to meme stocks;

2) gme bag holders AREN‚ÄôT going to lose! ( if they hold in time frames he was referring to ie years, not weeks/months.)

The number of times I have wanted to buy into a stock at say 200 only see it goes up to 210 that day and so I don‚Äôt buy‚Ä¶ Is zero. If I like it at 200 I like it at 210

He is a bastard in short.


Mvis will be back around $24/share by end of June, or close... by years end it will be in the $30‚Äôs.. or more... don‚Äôt be so nearsighted bros and hoes... if you sell it, you lose money... 

If you want to catch a buzz, and buy and sell for the thrill of it, set some cash aside to do that.. but the idea is to grow slow and steady. That wins the race.. and doc brown is a prick, I‚Äôm out."

2021-04-30 15:55:39,wallstreetbets,"Typically resistances are considered a defensive layer in most technical ARPG games. You're usually working with the four elements as sub classifications of resistance, but this isn't always the case. Some good examples of this would be games that feature light and dark resistance, or chaos and magic resistance. Not technically orthodox, but not uncommon either.  


When your character receives an input of damage from one of the elements that you have a resistance type for it's generally going to be mitigated by that resistance layer first before passing through to other layers your character may have, such as armor, evasion (sometimes referred to as defense), or magical shield sort of things (think protos from SC).  


I hope this has helped you understand the fundamentals of resistances a bit better.  


Good luck out there : )"

2021-04-30 10:54:33,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha it's like we're twins
2021-04-30 10:40:19,wallstreetbets,I viewed this as a long term hold figured it'd thank after earnings
2021-04-30 09:58:07,wallstreetbets,I know the feeling. I could have more than doubled my money. Instead I just sold a portion to cover my initial investment +  a small profit. Now I'm just riding the waves up and down lol.
2021-04-29 21:59:28,wallstreetbets,You really need sell rules. How do you let it go -44%?
2021-04-30 00:39:53,wallstreetbets,Too late to buy puts homie.
2021-04-29 20:08:14,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs going lower but puts will depreciate in value cause of IV crush. Not a good strat either
2021-04-29 20:01:31,wallstreetbets,Do this -> loose more -> move on to the next meme -> repeat until out of money.
2021-04-29 22:21:00,wallstreetbets,This is the way. See you in tendie land next week. Just be sure to stack up on ours once we reach our peak and set limit loss for the impending crash üôåüèºüôåüèºü¶ç
2021-04-29 21:30:23,wallstreetbets,It gives you good results but you have to not be greedy
2021-04-30 10:11:52,wallstreetbets,Just bought 2000 shares on the dip
2021-04-30 08:58:00,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs fucking rude. We prefer the term retards
2021-04-29 23:09:37,wallstreetbets,Is that what mania is?

(1) See a few posts on a stock, ignore it because there‚Äôs another shiny one taking their attention at the moment. 

(2) See said stock increase by a crazy % over a couple of days.

(3) Perfectly time the top and dump your life savings into the stock because it‚Äôs guaranteed money.

(4) Sell for a huge loss and complain that no one on WSB knows what they‚Äôre on about

(5) Rinse and repeat

I seem to be one of the few around here that actually made profit on CLOV and MVIS"
2021-04-30 00:07:37,wallstreetbets,"you have to buy it early and sell once it hits multiple posts front page.

learned that the hard way from GME, AMC, etc. and have made back almost all my money through scalping WSB fads. bought CLOV calls as soon as I saw some posts starting to rise yesterday and sold today on the opening high. people will try to shame you for profit taking and not being DIAMOND HANDS but all diamond hands did for me was bagholding and missing opportunities for other stocks."
2021-04-29 20:08:27,wallstreetbets,Puts will likely be too expensive tomorrow to make money; you definitely won‚Äôt ‚Äúeven out‚Äù if you buy puts.

2021-04-30 11:03:36,wallstreetbets,"not a shit stock, just the wrong stock to diamond hand. like you said, diamond hand undervalued companies that you believe in. stocks like GME and others that become FOTW on reddit it is better to just make quick scalps off people buying the hype.

I think GME is a fine stock with potential growth but not something I'm jumping to get into long term at current price. I've already moved half my portfolio into a long term stock I really believe in."
2021-04-30 11:17:13,wallstreetbets,Lesson learned

2021-04-30 01:07:41,wallstreetbets,"How long would you be willing to hold? 6 months? A year? Longer? It‚Äôs a promising company, but earnings were as expected, and there was about a 1% chance of a buyout announcement considering they just dropped the PR yesterday for the A-sample. If you wait 2-3 or more quarters, you‚Äôll probably be fine, maybe sooner."
2021-04-30 08:45:02,wallstreetbets,"Well, technically earnings were missed by 100%"
2021-04-30 11:59:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I agree with you that GME isn't objectively a ""shit"" stock, but at that price it's just completely ridiculous to think you should just ""diamond hand"" it"
2021-04-30 12:20:06,wallstreetbets,"I agree. You should have seen how many comments/DM's I got for saying I sold at $290 calling me dumb, paperhands, ""biggest regret you'll have"" after I finally recovered from buying at $300 in first squeeze averaging down to $100 and holding through the 40s. As a first time trader I got swept up in the emotions/hype of the first run and I feel like I learned a shit ton since then."

2021-04-30 13:29:16,wallstreetbets,"Palantir is a scam as currently constructed.

I work in AI and want to tell you yards something loud and clear, ANY company selling AI in a box is selling you crap.

Building useful ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is 9 times out of 10 not the code or algorithm you plan on using, most of which are open source and published in academic journals by the way, but in working with stakeholders to properly define the problem, then build data sets, clean and manipulate messy data, then run the modeling, and finally turning predictions and correlations into a product or action by engineering reports, automated actions, an app or what have you.

The entire process takes a lot of human involvement from business stakeholders to data scientists to product managers and software engineers.

No company has sold a successful AI toolkit to a business that they just plug in and it can tackle all kinds of problems. There are companies that sell AI toolkits like Data Robot, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Alteryx, etc that preload models and functions for producing data science tools faster.

There are companies that sell products that use AI, such as using machine vision to create medical protesthetics based on a scan of your bones. 

Each application is carefully curated and the model only works within the system it‚Äôs isolated in.

Palantir has a nice UI, secretive business, prestige, and a general tool that lays out data points, files, etc in a graph and then allows you to search for connections.

They can‚Äôt sell Wendy‚Äôs corporate a tool that will predict which stores you poors are going to be giving hand jobs in the back of. 

I don‚Äôt think we will see AGI in our lifetimes. 

Any AI play should have a specific problem they are trying to solve and a road to solving it, but never just a hope of creating ‚Äútrue‚Äù AI.

If the company is selling a software toolkit for scaling vms or visualization, then sure invest.

If they are selling AI consulting and helping businesses implement ‚ÄúAI‚Äù and have consultants, product managers, data scientists/ml scientists/ml engineers, domain specific experts/researchers, software devs, etc then invest. 

If they are selling Watson, run away."

2021-04-29 21:59:59,wallstreetbets,"It does not factor in the crush. The implied volatility is what makes the value of an option higher. Usually after earnings if a stock goes way up or down, the implied volatility shrinks, or crushes so to speak. So with very low implied volatility with all the bad news out, the premium shrinks."

2021-04-29 22:01:28,wallstreetbets,I paid $1 for my May $13 puts. Is it not going to print as I am expecting it to due to IV crush?
2021-04-29 22:26:18,wallstreetbets,"This is not true at all. IV makes the extrinsic value of option higher. It has no bearing on the intrinsic value. 

Second, the IV of a stock INCREASES if a stock moves either site in big number. IV decreases when underlying trades side ways. 

With earnings, the IV crush happens when the difference in the same strikes put and call (straddle) of 1DTE after earning is MORE than the difference in the change in the securities movement. While IV Crush can happen all the time, it‚Äôs called ‚Äúcrush‚Äù in earnings because that‚Äôs when people expect the price to move in definite terms. So if the price movement is less than the excepted, IV goes down (this is just market correcting itself), but if price movement is MORE than the expected, IV goes up (again correcting the other way). 

TLDR: you‚Äôre wrong on IV crush, MVIS going -20% is gonna increase the IV, not ‚Äúcrush it‚Äù. The premium would be bigger, not smaller."
2021-04-30 10:41:48,wallstreetbets,"honestly, while i was listening to the er, i didnt really find anything worthy of a 20% drop. i feel like most of it was attributed to the hype on mvis dying down, and the classic buy the rumor sell the news effect."

2021-04-29 23:02:59,wallstreetbets,"Because your strike is so OTM, 100% of your profit (premium) is made by extrinsic value. This means in simplest term, IV is the only thing giving you profit. The actual underlying movement does not matter- what matters is how that movement impacts the IV and the Vega."
2021-04-29 23:54:54,wallstreetbets,Exactly! IV Crush takes place when there is a level of certainty the day after earnings. I claim there is still massive uncertainty.

2021-04-29 22:18:28,wallstreetbets,"But when IV crushes, it won't matter as much. Yes he will make some money. But most likely he bought them when IV was sky high. You can visualize this option profit calculator. And play with the IV %"

2021-04-29 22:04:45,wallstreetbets,You're in a better position than me. At least you are close to the money. You should be at least triple right from the open if it stays under 14. If it gets support at 14 then we both might be f'ed
2021-04-29 23:00:53,wallstreetbets,"Only partially. IV is intangible, it can't be known in advance only inferred from observation after the fact. That's because its true driver is market sentiment. Generally it's driven by uncertainty, which can absolutely be attributable to large movements, but other things can factor in as well.

In the runup to any known market moving event uncertainty will be high, and IV trends to go up with it. After the event uncertainty goes down and IV falls with it. You could say that was to do with expected price moves, and I'm not even going to say you're wrong. ""The market"" is seldom able to be reduced to clean formulaic relationships. There always seems to wind up being some error term that comes to dominate the whole system -which is what IV is, really.

Something I noticed that was interesting is that when üõë was going crazy it almost had the inverse of the ""normal"" response to price changes. Normally your average stock is going to go up over time, so there's less uncertainty when they're doing that. So green days tend to kill volatility and red days increase it (since they're relatively abnormal). Well IV for üõë would go up along with the price and down with it too. I think it's the market's way of suggesting those peaks were not sustainable.

I think that's what happens when IV crushes even after bad results. The market is saying that the thing that was driving uncertainty is gone now, so there aren't likely to be any drastic movements going forward. If I had to bet I'd bet on him getting hurt by crush to a degree that would surprise the people throwing the numbers into a calculator."
2021-04-29 22:40:27,wallstreetbets,"Implied volatility does not care which direction it goes into. Implied volatility is exactly what it says, implied is what gives intrinsic value up or down. It is more pronounced in the downwards Direction because a stock could not go below zero, therefore the word Crush comes into play. But in the upwards Direction there is an implied volatility decrease as well as in the downwards Direction."
2021-04-30 11:55:57,wallstreetbets,"Well, the most damaging things they stated was about production and that is very far down the road. Basically, what was stated on the er is that they will most likely do another cash raise which fucks shareholders. Plus their operating is running at even a larger deficit. Plus the earnings basically states this company is grossly over valued which is why people sold. Hell a Wendy‚Äôs makes more money than this company lol."
2021-04-30 12:43:51,wallstreetbets,"Next time try ITM options if you are confident about a drop. The $15 puts yesterday would have netted a much higher return. Most times, severely OTM options get IV crushed."

2021-04-29 23:07:25,wallstreetbets,"Right, so when more ü¶çsee that the price has dropped so hard, why wouldn‚Äôt they look to buy lower, cheaper puts thus increasing the IV ?  Or am I way off base understanding how that works?"
2021-04-29 23:18:26,wallstreetbets,"We aren‚Äôt talking about a stock with good value though....this thing made half a mil in the quarter and it‚Äôs market cap was in the Billions or some such?  If it had fundamentals, I could see the two sides to the story. But this one is not such."

2021-04-29 22:13:24,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs hope it tanks in PM below $14 then haha
2021-04-29 23:12:22,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. I think this is a very unique situation with microvision. The run-up was due to our conversations here, so implied volatility was high anyway. Coming down, the cat was already out of the bag and the volatility stayed High. That's because the price was already so high for no good reason other than us talking about it, and when it came down, whether it went up or back down was still extremely uncertain because there were NOT any normal forces acting. And even though earnings came out today, I believe the uncertainty, which is the true measure of IV, it's still very high! At least that's my story and I'm sticking to it!ü§£üòÇü§û"
2021-04-29 22:46:49,wallstreetbets,">Implied volatility does not care which direction it goes into. 

Yep, what I said. 

>implied is what gives intrinsic value up or down. 

Yep what I said. 

>It is more pronounced in the downwards Direction because a stock could not go below zero, therefore the word Crush comes into play. 

The first part is mathematically true- the second part is false( not really false, I may misunderstood what you said but IV crush is delta neutral). 

>But in the upwards Direction there is an implied volatility decrease as well as in the downwards Direction.

Not exactly sure what this means. Upward movement thats more than excepted is IV positive, Upward movement less then expected is the IV crush. Same true for down ward movement."

2021-04-29 23:15:38,wallstreetbets,"The same reasoning, if the underlying lost 20%, why wouldn‚Äôt some random ape buy cheap calls that just lost massively? Or the stock itself now that it‚Äôs in a ‚Äúdip‚Äù. 

The pricing is not just 1 way, if a stock drops massively, would you buy puts or calls? The first is hoping for more drops, the later is hoping for up trend after a dip. And what about stock buyers? If you know a stock did -20% AH, would you buy that stock or sell that stock? 

Some people will do one, others will do the other."
2021-04-29 23:24:11,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not exactly sure what you are trying to say but a 60% OTM put is 100% extrinsic value not because the stock is bad or good but because the definition of a premium of a OTM strike is that‚Äôs it‚Äôs extrinsic. 

As in, the same rule applies to MVIS, AAPl, and GME."

2021-04-29 22:53:59,wallstreetbets,What I meant was whether the price goes up after earnings or down the implied volatility Crush will reduce the amount of intrinsic value therefore reducing the additional premium on the option price.. So after all of this we actually agree on everything! LOL
2021-04-29 23:08:28,wallstreetbets,"You are still confusing terms. IV crush impacts the EXTRINSIC value. The intrinsic value is only for strikes ITM and the difference of their strike and underlying. 

And the actual movement of the price is not what causes the crush. It‚Äôs the difference of the expected and the actual movement. A stock that moves 1% up after earnings when expected was .5% will not have IV crush. A stock that moves 10% up when expected was 15% will cause IV crush. In both situation stock moves up but you make money on the first but lose money in the last.

The expected price movement is the difference in a same strike same expiry put and call premiums."

2021-04-29 20:36:07,wallstreetbets,"Fair question.   
Admittedly, T isn't as flashy as GME, PLTR, AMC or BB, its still a ""bet."" It has been on a downward trend, but T is making some headlines. Sure, it's a boomer stock, but I feel it's an undervalued boomer stock that isn't getting much attention because it pays high dividends, and dividends are boring. But, if people look start looking at this stock by the numbers, the yield is crazy high, the PE ratio is crazy low, and their sales are solid. The downside is that for the first time in several years, their dividend didn't increase YOY in 2020-21. First time in awhile. Could be a bad sign. Analysts are mixed. 

This stock could drop to the low $20s and I would lose 30%, or it could bounce to $45 and give me 150%. 

I don't know if this belongs on WSB or not, I figure I would let the community decide. I did follow the community rules though.

Since you're the one being made to make the top, you are the top and the 1 cent higher order will likely not trigger.

2021-04-30 00:07:56,wallstreetbets,"Call Option: someone pays to reserve the right to buy shares (in lots of 100) at a certain price (the Strike Price) at or before the expiration date. 

If you hold the stock, you can be the one *selling* the call. You are ""covered"" by the fact that you already own the stock. If you sell it for a strike price higher than you paid, great - either the option expires un-used (and you just gained the premium), or if the holder exercises the option you just sold the shares at a profit.\* 

&#x200B;

Say you buy $ASS for $100/share. $ASS has been trading sideways, neither highly up or down. You figure you'll try and charge some optimist fees and sell a Call option to some other trader with an expiry of a week from now and a strike price of $110/share. 

If $ASS's price doesn't move, then hey: at least you got the premium. If $ASS goes up but not to $110 then the option still expires worthless, and you still get the premium. 

If $ASS goes up to $140/share then your contract is probably going to get exercised - with the contract holder buying 100 of your $ASS shares for $110/share. You make 1000 bucks on the share sale and the premium on the contract; on the other hand, if you hadn't written that contract you could have sold 100 of those shares for $4000 in profit. 

\----

The price you sell that option for depends on a lot of things, but generally-speaking it's about the probability of that contract being exercised. Wildly unlikely-to-happen options don't cost very much... but if they *do* pay off, they're worth a ton. Hence the ""bets"" part of WallStreetBets: basically it's a lottery ticket, or lucky set of spins on a roulette wheel. 

This sub has a long history of people buying ridiculous options, wagering huge amounts of money on super-unlikely options; stuff like ""maybe this stock doubles its price tomorrow"". 

\----

Selling options is more of a /r/thetagang thing. *Buying* options is the WallStreetBets play."
2021-04-29 23:39:14,wallstreetbets,"He can sell calls, using his shares for collateral. Since each option covers 100 shares, he can sell 25 call options on these shares. They either expire worthless and he keeps the premiums and stock, or they expire in the money and his shares get purchased off him at the strike price (and he also keeps the premiums)"
2021-04-29 20:43:54,wallstreetbets,"Ohhhh, you set up a limit buy/sell pair at $10.50/$10.51?  You need to go back to remedial pricing training and go watch a bunch of The Price Is Right and then go bid ona bunch of stuff on eBay.  Round numbers are resistance points that stocks will bounce off of because everyone else sets up orders on those nice round numbers.  Stocks are also a study in contrarian behavior where you understand what other people do and then exploit they're predictability by operating tangentially to them.

Lazy people are going to just set up a bunch of sell orders at $10.50, so in order for the stock to rise past that the buy pressure has to chew through that backlog.  Realistically if it does make it past that resistance point it's gonna plow past it by a decent chunk.

I never set up a limit sell for $10.51, I do it for $10.47.  In the case of what you were doing I'd do it for $10.43/$10.44, or maybe get greedy and already them a bit.  If I'm really sure it's going last $10.50 then I might set it for $10.52/$10.56.  The $10.52 price is protected by the $10.50 wall so whatever pressure it takes to blast through it is in my useless opinion pretty likely to hit $10.56 too.

Standard disclaimer: I'm not a stock market professional, hell I'm not even qualified to sell bubble gum."
2021-04-29 22:39:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah but how much are you leveraging to get that $50? Surely not $30k? That's retarded.

My biggest play right now is ROOT but I'm quite down at the moment. Hopefully it works out."

2021-04-30 09:36:49,wallstreetbets,"But being careful, one can vastly outperform the market while compounding daily. Fuck a 7% a year. I made 13% yesterday. Careful plays can and do work if you‚Äôre good at making the right pick."

2021-04-29 23:50:43,wallstreetbets,So covered calls can‚Äôt go tits up? Like if it goes past the strike + premium obviously you make less money but you still made money.
2021-04-29 20:48:27,wallstreetbets,$11.77/$11.78 is what I did. I avoid psychologically meaningful numbers as my entry/exit too.
2021-04-29 22:09:17,wallstreetbets,Cuz every even number has pressure right those numbers can just be numbers remember that. There could be 1 share there but really be 1 billion shares. You never know until your watching the prints
2021-04-29 22:53:08,wallstreetbets,You explain it well... ‚Äúlazy people setting limit orders create resistance points.‚Äù   ‚ÄúIt takes a lot of buy pressure to chew through it.‚Äù  I love  the lingo.

2021-04-30 01:34:38,wallstreetbets,"Ah you'll be fine. I'm sure it'll be above that again soon. In fact since I'm waiting for a dip to get in, I guarantee it will pop off just to spite me. Watch it and remember me."
2021-04-29 23:45:51,wallstreetbets,That's the main reason I'm holding tbh

2021-04-29 22:28:13,wallstreetbets,Because of all the less risky ways of making $25
2021-04-29 22:34:14,wallstreetbets,"I have to explain to you why leveraging $30k for a $25 scalp is a fucking retarded move? There is no hope for some of you guys lmao

Buy a SPY call or put at almost any point during the day for $500, set a limit sell for $525, and you can make $25 easy‚Äîputting up $500, rather than 60x that."
2021-04-29 22:17:41,wallstreetbets,Why would you put 30k on the line for $25 üò≥ better off just betting on a dead cert sport game
2021-04-29 22:21:40,wallstreetbets,"Because he‚Äôs risking $30000 for a $25 gain...

That‚Äôs a 0.00083% gain for investing in a stock that‚Äôs had a 50% run up in the last month so definitely had potential to come down, and did.

He lost $5k for it so I‚Äôd say it was pretty dumb."
2021-04-29 22:22:48,wallstreetbets,How many times have you been dropped on your head?
2021-04-29 21:17:39,wallstreetbets,I think I‚Äôm in CLOV now

2021-04-29 21:06:40,wallstreetbets,Sounds lovely
2021-04-29 22:02:42,wallstreetbets,Chart looks like a slaughter house bud
2021-04-30 01:43:11,wallstreetbets,You want a 100k just so you can lose it? wtf?
2021-04-30 09:38:43,wallstreetbets,But that's boringggg. I want to feel alive.
2021-04-29 23:54:29,wallstreetbets,Well the underlying stock can tank and you could lose tons of money. You basically are limiting your downside while capping your upside.
2021-04-29 20:53:38,wallstreetbets,"Well crap, I guess you're going long then."
2021-04-29 22:27:31,wallstreetbets,Or you can get a service like Bookmap and actually *see* those outstanding limit orders.
2021-04-30 08:06:40,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. Yeah looking at the charts there is definite support at $78, but I believe that will stay higher. Resistance at $99. This stock seems so undervalued for the earnings and potential growth, just how long to get a big move up"
2021-04-29 23:47:50,wallstreetbets,Can I get your opinion on all the zeroes in the OI for GME this week?  Confusing as hell for me
2021-04-29 23:48:40,wallstreetbets,The calls from 160ish to 200ish
2021-04-30 12:04:38,wallstreetbets,"More like ""Chief of Investment Straegy"""
2021-04-30 06:37:06,wallstreetbets,"Member when we were buying long dated Spy puts, like July 2020"
2021-04-29 23:35:30,wallstreetbets,"Next to the dumpster behind Wendy's, for instance"
2021-04-30 00:45:13,wallstreetbets,Hey $25 is $25
2021-04-30 00:02:51,wallstreetbets,"To be honest the phrasing makes it sound dumber than it is. By the same logic, if they set their sell at $100 higher we would be saying ‚Äúyou risked $30,000 for $250,000‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt take probability in to account. 

I am *not* saying that this was a smart move, only that simply saying ‚Äúyou risked $30,000 for $25‚Äù oversimplifies in a way that makes OP look even dumber. 

Edit to clarify: OP definitely should have had a stop loss in place, and this was not a smart play imo. Still this is not the dumbest thing I have ever seen on this sub."
2021-04-29 22:37:52,wallstreetbets,Wasn't leveraged at least
2021-04-29 23:39:37,wallstreetbets,lol I made $25 on retarded AMC puts I bought mid-day and set a sell order for immediately. I only put in $53.
2021-04-30 05:56:49,wallstreetbets,"Oh don't worry about hope for me, I'm fine. The trade wasn't stupid. A lot of you new guys look at some of these things as a risk reward. Options are easy, but the way he entered into the trade there should have been a stop loss. You're not risking 30k for $25, it's using that much capital in hopes to quickly scalp it. Options go to zero, stocks very rarely do. Maybe he wants to hold it long term and want to tell a story on reddit. Here's another thing for you. I have qqq arkk arkg arkw and a handful of others I sell weeky calls on most of them. Are you saying I'm stupid for ""risking"" over six figures to make a couple hundred bucks a week? I can say without doubt, what I'm doing is far less risky than what you're doing. Your perspective is all wrong."
2021-04-30 01:26:57,wallstreetbets,Not to mention stops are notoriously unreliable. Plus with a discount brokerage where a penny of arbitrage is available to a retail investor I'm sure the entity on the other side of that trade was able to see both standing orders.
2021-04-29 22:31:58,wallstreetbets,"Because 99% of the time it works, and the other 1% of the time stonks only go up."
2021-04-30 08:17:02,wallstreetbets,he probably believes CLOV is going up regardless
2021-04-30 05:48:04,wallstreetbets,"It's funny because he's not really risking 30k. If he wanted to scalp a penny, he should have maybe set a stop loss 4 cents out of to lose only $100."
2021-04-29 23:17:02,wallstreetbets,".083% gain or $0.00083 return per invested dollar

you did the decimal *and* the percentage sign, which is off by a factor of 100

$30 would be 1/10th of 1%, or .1% , so it looks extra silly with all of those zeroes"
2021-04-29 21:26:42,wallstreetbets,The beating of our hearts is the only sound
2021-04-29 21:40:25,wallstreetbets,I guess we are guessing now?
2021-04-29 22:08:31,wallstreetbets,"I don't care much for charts. But for those who do, it broke out of its descending wedge a few days ago."
2021-04-30 07:20:22,wallstreetbets,"he's saying he wants way more than 100k, enough so he wouldn't care about blowing 100k on a single call."
2021-04-30 09:48:16,wallstreetbets,"If I ever saw negative 6k in my accounts I‚Äôd damn sure not feel alive, but you do you."
2021-04-30 01:45:58,wallstreetbets,Lol no but seriously
2021-04-29 23:51:48,wallstreetbets,Only 0s I see in OI for GME are on $5 and $10 calls. Considering it's a weekly expiry I don't think that's unusual.
2021-04-30 18:23:27,wallstreetbets,HA yes
2021-04-30 07:27:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but nickels are heavy."
2021-04-30 07:37:38,wallstreetbets,"He's picking up fractions of a penny in front of a steam roller...  Doesn't matter how you say it, the percentage is the same.

Even if it worked 999 out of 1000 times, the 1 out of 1000 where it failed like just now would wipe out all profits and he'd be at a loss"
2021-04-29 22:55:56,wallstreetbets,"It might not have been to start but, with opportunity cost, it is now!"
2021-04-30 02:22:44,wallstreetbets,Am smooth brain. How this work? Sound too easy.
2021-04-29 22:52:42,wallstreetbets,Even if it worked 99% of the time this loss cancels those gains out. Good luck with the strat my fellow tard
2021-04-29 23:18:34,wallstreetbets,Yeah you‚Äôre right. Still a very low gain for a sizeable risk.

2021-04-30 09:19:55,wallstreetbets,"I am not saying the probability is right for his decision. But if it worked for example 999,999,999 out of 1,000,000,000 it would absolutely be worth doing this. The odds don‚Äôt justify it in this case, but there are strategies that have low return for high collateral and they are not always wrong solely for the ratio of collateral vs return. If he set a stop loss it certainly would have made more sense. 

I just think we should he honest when hammering the guy and weigh collateral, timeframe, probability, and ROI together. This sub tends to only look at 2 of those factors at once and wonders why theta gang eats their dinner."
2021-04-30 06:21:47,wallstreetbets,"options are literally free money, you can't lose."
2021-04-29 22:56:34,wallstreetbets,Not a loss until I sell. For now it's just a reason not to check my portfolio. It'll be a loss later once the hopelessness finally takes over and the loss is at least twice as large.
2021-04-30 10:37:45,wallstreetbets,"If you want to be honest, you'd acknowledge that what you're talking about is dominated by high frequency algos and retail traders will lose money trying to imitate so there's no reason to even talk about probability.  Thus the only appropriate response is to make fun of OP, no matter how you look at it."
2021-04-30 01:07:51,wallstreetbets,Just sell covered calls and you will be fine
2021-04-30 08:20:06,wallstreetbets,"It's not a loss, you've just diversified your long-term portfolio!"
2021-04-30 04:12:14,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-30 02:13:46,wallstreetbets,One of us!
2021-04-30 11:23:53,wallstreetbets,Sell lots of covered calls in the meantime?
2021-04-29 22:58:20,wallstreetbets,"At least your honest with yourself üòÇ

I got out of CLOV around the top because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anything special long term. I only expected it to return to NAV so the extra $1 a share was nice."
2021-04-30 12:08:54,wallstreetbets,"Lol yea algos do dominate that kind of trade that is a good honest take. Of course actual humans do scalp momentum all the time, but they set *stop losses* and that should really be the lesson. The sell price target is kind of irrelevant but driving the collateral/ROI barrage against OP.

People saying that this post is the dumbest thing they‚Äôve ever seen on the sub when we got folks riding YOLO FDs to 0 every week."
2021-04-30 16:26:22,wallstreetbets,I mean really this would probably generate more income than scalping.

\-lenovo sharing patents

\-Prioritizing retention of employees and adequate compensation.

**HBO Max vs Disney+, Past 7 days (present/ Television Network):**

* HBO  still is surpassing Disney+ in the past seven days in when searching as  a ""Television Network"" as in the first graph at the top.
* If you follow the link it is showing twice the interest at peak periods of the day even near the end of the week

**HBO vs Netflix U.S., Past 12 Months:**

https://preview.redd.it/k06n9arg1jw61.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a4ed6133fccdbf0f6f499b3027be0fc140867f9

* HBO gained the most subscribers in Q4 2020 with the release of Wonder Woman. Roughly 8 million net additions domestically for Nov-Dec alone. You can see this in the holiday uptick on the graph (above).
* Netflix also had a holiday uptick from viewers but it did not gain a lot of subscribers. No Box Office hit like Wonder Woman.
* Box Office hit + Uptick in google trends = subscribers (theory).
* HBO had no big upticks or box office hits in Q1 2020. A small uptick for Snyder cut, maybe but still not that noticeable, they added 2.7 Million net subscribers and still beat estimates.
* AT&T/HBO had 1 big uptick, and 1 medium one in Q2 2020 already (Kong and Mortal Kombat).
* HBO estimated 67-70 Million subscribers worldwide by the EOY while considering that they go international this June. If they got another 8 million domestically this April they would be at 70 Million today before the international push. They might not have.

&#x200B;

**HBO vs Netflix, Past 90 Days:**

HBO closer in the month of April regardless of upticks than any previous month.

* HBO has previously beaten estimates by alot and it did not really affect share price. However it now will make a bigger difference in terms of ARPU then it did in the past.
* Graph/Link (below) by an author who a couple days earlier was negative towards HBO. Stating that it was not sticking. He rechecked his numbers.
* Warner Bro's/HBO is not the main part of AT&T's business. They are a big company with a lot of debt. This is just a look at the movies/streaming services this quarter.

**Paramount vs Peacock, WorldWide past 90 days:**

* Peacock went from 31 M subscribers Q4 2020 to 42 M in Q1 2020.
* Paramount+ really had its debut on March 4th, big uptick.
* This graph makes it seem like ""paramount"" could be close to ""peacock"" in terms of subscriptions. Nothing to note for April though, no second big uptick.
* This is not a perfect tool, just something to see. More info from HBO graph than this one.
* Both businesses have more than just streaming as major revenue sources

**Kong might make $1 Billion in profit this quarter alone, not counting HBO subscriber gain.**

Another point for movies this year is  online rentals for Godzilla vs Kong might have been close to box office  revenues due to covid-19. Only the U.S. gets it for free on HBO. International rollout for HBO set for this June.

In other countries you could rent Kong for 48 hours for $20-25.  More theaters were closed outside the U.S leading to higher likelihood of renting the movie.  It was $25 to see the Box Office hit of the spring. Not bad for you or your kids to see the epic monster mash.  Probably hadn't been to theaters or rented/paid for a movie in a while.

&#x200B;

* Only U.S. gets it for free on HBO + Theaters were more likely closed in other countries.
* Worldwide ticket sales are roughly $70 million U.S.  and $500 Million International.
* Kong made $500 million in ticket sales and may have made close to another $500 million renting online.
* That's only 25 million people @ $25.00.
* If 10 million people worldwide rented it that is $200 million + no splitting ticket sales with theaters + HBO subscribers.

&#x200B;

* Godzilla  movies generally net like $100 million in ticket sales in Japan alone and is generally one of the highest grossing films of the year for them. Mugen Train just made over $350 Million in ticket sales in Japan alone.
* Kong has yet to be released in Japan and has the potential for alot more money. It is being released late there on May 14th.
* Been delayed again since due to covid-19, maybe they'll just make everyone rent it... or try a Japan HBO rollout.
* Potentially 1/2 - 1 billion dollars of profit from one movie is nothing to sneeze at for a single quarter (150 Million budget).
* No real idea of how many people rented it.

I  do however know people who rented Mortal Kombat and bought the game as well this  quarter (another AT&T). Don't know anyone who rented Kong but I have not asked so...

Warner Bro's/HBO is not the main part of AT&T's business. They are a big company with a lot of debt. This is just a look at the movies/streaming services this quarter.

2021-04-29 21:39:06,wallstreetbets,"Out of all of its competitors, ViacomCBS is a content GIANT... its sole existence is creating content for big screen and television... Netflix is also in this camp, but it‚Äôs content is peanuts compared to ViacomCBS... Netflix GETS a ton of content from them, licensing... you can argue Comcast as well, but, they are also bogged down with cable/wireless services... also, ViacomCBS has developed the golden ticket, or in the streaming wars, they have the trident nuclear warhead.. a strong synergy between an SVOD, P+, and an AVOD, Pluto TV... then of course look at dominance of CBS as a prime time network, and all of the live sports they have contracts with, and will stream on both.. NFL, NCAA, PGA, Champions League, that in addition to their HUGE content library.. showtime, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, etc. and of course Paramount Pictures, which is full reopening... several big movies in the pipeline, and with their fcf, share offering, and sale of Simon and Schuester, they will $10 BILLION to make new content... and as soon as all those licensing agreements end with the competitor streaming services, ALL that content goes to P*... as some said, ViacomCBS is a SLEEPING GIANT"

2021-04-30 08:23:39,wallstreetbets,Big box office movies don't do well as direct release on streaming platforms compared to theatres. It's just a way better experience to go see a movie you really want to see at a theatre.  AMC likely restructured contracts in their favor after big Hollywood studios lost even more than AMC did. Hollywood would not be nearly as profitable going the streaming route vs theatres.

Cable is expensive to administer for even cable box fees and they have a lot of effort trying to collect fees for forced bundles from other content providers. I think if comcast can go app only and more  global with sports rights because the owners are too greedy to front the money and do it themselves due to player salaries.  They will make out well and also they could get some of the nbastreams type market to buy in especially attached to betting in app purchases.

2021-04-30 05:37:53,wallstreetbets,"I was wondering betting on PHub and porn industry in general even after a year of potential auditory being locked at homes. Unfortunately PHub is private and the owner has links to corns, shady marketplace and scandals. Also PHub made a PR disaster by removing big part of their content in order to fight claims about child abuse and shit. If it would be public, I would bet it tanked at that moment quite hard and would be perfect opportunity to load (no pun intended).  Anyway, as I've tried to dig tendies related to the the PHub - someone has mentioned there's also a mother-shell company, which supposedly grips the tendies from underlying company. Checked their reports - hasn't found any proof.   
There's always PLBY, but I don't trust them, since they always tried to be Forbes/WSJ with a twist. My best bet would be the one company I think I\`m not allowed to mention because of cap and price, also I think it got delisted from NYSE.

2021-04-29 20:02:11,wallstreetbets,"I grabbed the $4.5 strike expiry tommorrow but I bought when it was $4.60 so I‚Äôm already ITM

Shares are always a good idea but they may only go up 10%-20% as compared to 30-100% 

It depends on your risk/reward level calls are definetly riskier but offer more reward I think ITM strikes or just at breakeven is a good call for this week or 2 weeks- 1 month out

Also the IV making the calls cheap also makes it a bad share play because you can‚Äôt sell calls or theta gang your way out of red but I know not everyone gets that advanced and most just hold till green

Here‚Äôs one scenario NOK hits $5

If you buy 1000 shares at $4.70 you‚Äôll only make $300 or .063%

10 NOK calls (10 calls is equivalent to 1000shares) at $4.5 for .20 costs $200 but would be worth $500 if it hits $5 so 150%

Nokia is ranked #1 in 5G patents.
Furthermore, Nokia has a great name, and with good new team of management, and could become the next big player in telecom. At a 25B market cap, there is room for them to double IMO by end of 2021.

2021-04-30 00:01:01,wallstreetbets,The float..............
2021-04-30 00:53:36,wallstreetbets,"Have about a dozen shares and two $4.5 contracts that expire 01/22 and five $17 contracts that expire 01/23.  Those $17 contracts....I had no clue what options were beyond ""shares times 100 and you can win big!"" and thought, ""Let's goooooooooo!""  But the rest seems smartish."

Hopefully I‚Äôll see green soon!!"
2021-04-30 08:22:39,wallstreetbets,I have 17 $7 calls for 2023 I‚Äôm long in NOK.
2021-04-30 08:28:56,wallstreetbets,How do they monetise those patents?
2021-04-30 08:30:50,wallstreetbets,im in. im holding.
2021-04-30 09:21:33,wallstreetbets,Didnt they beat earnings by 800% only to go up like .40? Its got to big of a float to ever make a worth while move.
2021-04-30 09:35:03,wallstreetbets,"They had a lot of contracts from big Telecom companies, but it did not affect the stock much. I don't think it is going to change any time soon. Even though they bought Alcatel-lucent and there were rumors they are going to buy Juniper, it did not affect the stonk much"
2021-04-30 10:13:06,wallstreetbets,"There are many people mentioning that NOK has too many shares to move, which is true, they are heavily diluted, but it doesnt mean it's hopeless. Back in late January during the big meme stock push, you apes brought the price to over 9$. And yesterday after earnings, it was up 20% premarket. So, it can be done, although given its not exactly an ideal solution with 6billion shares, I wouldn't count NOK out just yet and just because its too hard to move the price with the volume of outstanding shares."
2021-04-30 10:15:52,wallstreetbets,Sigh   *buys more NOK*
2021-04-30 10:58:42,wallstreetbets,I am placing calls for 2023 on this one.
2021-04-30 11:08:32,wallstreetbets,Whats under valued is ocgn
2021-04-30 11:56:56,wallstreetbets,In for $500 on NOK
2021-04-30 16:19:08,wallstreetbets,"Long on NOK @4.3, and loving it üì±üì±üì±"
2021-04-30 16:22:32,wallstreetbets,"The thing with NOK is that they have a 5.4 billion share float and declining sales numbers. 

I believe QCOM is the better play for 5G, but it is also a slow moving stock."
2021-04-30 16:39:09,wallstreetbets,Will a Nokia phone break or will a bag holder break even?
2021-04-29 23:53:22,wallstreetbets,"current expected eps is .24 which is lower than it was in 2020 and yearly target is $5.00 a share. in the last 5 years it never hit $7.00. 

good luck but more than likely you are sol."
2021-04-30 00:55:18,wallstreetbets,Already lost with NOK. Not sure I‚Äôd go back. How can you tell if a posting is from some insider or HF who wants you to buy the hype?
2021-04-30 01:42:24,wallstreetbets,"Not ranked #1 but probably top 5.  Huawei, Samsung and LG have them beat.  Eriksson and Qualcomm have huge stakes as well."
2021-04-29 20:36:13,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been in the red since early January too. I bought 3000 shares for a long term investment. Nice to see green. This stock has been seriously undervalued for months. I‚Äôm holding with zero interest in selling anytime soon. NOK is rebounding and will continue to grow
2021-04-29 23:58:49,wallstreetbets,"Hold?!?!?  Hold is a terrible thing to say,  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm buying more‚Äù that is the correct terminology."
2021-04-29 21:51:19,wallstreetbets,I finally broke even...still holding because i r estupid.
2021-04-30 01:38:51,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs gonna be a VERY long hold. (From former holder of NOK)
2021-04-30 00:07:23,wallstreetbets,"I got fucked in January too, bought $7 calls while it was on the way up, then nobody was allowed to buy it and I lost 95%. Fortunately I figured some shady Shit might happen and made sure to get Jan 2022 $7 calls, so now I just look at my loss every day until it becomes a real loss‚Ä¶ unless‚Ä¶"
2021-04-30 02:46:18,wallstreetbets,I have $5 calls exp 1/21/22 that been  negative for 5 months... Is it time for them to print finally?
2021-04-30 09:38:21,wallstreetbets,"This is solid long hold 2-3 years or more. Q1 is normally their worst and they are in the beginning of a turnaround with new CEO, yet they smashed the earnings already. The company is still way undervalued. It has the largest 5G patent portfolio and billions of cash . The price/book is less than 2 and price/sales about 1. Nokia is a no brainer buy until at least 8$."
2021-04-30 01:46:34,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been holding 1200 shares since January. Average cost $5.21 before I sold a few wayyyy OTM covered calls. I‚Äôm in it for the long haul.
2021-04-30 07:40:41,wallstreetbets,Buy Reddit accounts more like it. Literally every dude in here rocking a 3 month.
2021-04-30 05:52:41,wallstreetbets,"Lmao i got 4 contracts for Jan 23 $6C, so I‚Äôm right there with ya! WE BELIEVE"
2021-04-30 08:27:29,wallstreetbets,Jan 23 $5C gang checking in !  Scooped them up a few weeks back.
2021-04-30 09:57:11,wallstreetbets,23rd?
2021-04-30 16:09:17,wallstreetbets,"Just curious why write calls for NOK, it's pretty much bottomed out with a lot of room for growth with all the good news coming out. Not hatin' just curious to see both sides."
2021-04-29 23:57:26,wallstreetbets,its operating expenses are 7 billion and hasn't actually returned a profit.
2021-04-30 09:26:17,wallstreetbets,The value is in the journey and the friends we make along the way.
2021-04-29 23:06:49,wallstreetbets,What does the number of shares have to do with anything? Do you think they'd have a different market cap if they had 1% of the shares at 100x the price per share?
2021-04-30 07:26:37,wallstreetbets,Irrelevant. Splits and reverse splits are mostly psychological things.
2021-04-29 23:42:57,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I'd buy the $5 up to $7 strike price options for January 2023. Their 5G deal revenue begins to really come in during Q4 2021. But every quarter from here on out will show solid revenue. 2022 and 2023 will be great years for them, and their 5G deals mostly extend out to 2026.

&#x200B;

\*\*edit\*\* long on NOK at average of $3.50. Holding calls for $4.50 6/18, $5 january 2022, and $6 january 2023."
2021-04-29 23:41:00,wallstreetbets,"they literally have a 5G deal with AT&T. and they own a ton of patents on RAND technology that people will be paying them fees for. also have a deal with TMobile, and just settled patent disputes with Lenovo and Samsung (lenovo and samsung will be paying them licensing fees as well)."
2021-04-30 00:52:16,wallstreetbets,They literally have a partnership with ATT to build 5g infrastructure.  What nonsense are you spouting?
2021-04-29 21:17:25,wallstreetbets,"How's ATT their competition for 5G equipment?

Huawei I could see having huge problems selling in the the US and other Western nations if China doesnt knock their shit off."
2021-04-30 10:14:07,wallstreetbets,you did not miss in GME it's still a buy
2021-04-30 16:12:28,wallstreetbets,"I think NOK's a good long term play.... but I'm thinking CLOV is the next move short term. MACD about to cross into the green, and signals point to it being primed for launch. Won't be anything like GME tho."
2021-04-29 21:19:19,wallstreetbets,Jan' 21 has passed dear ape.
2021-04-29 20:30:58,wallstreetbets,"This is so dumb, imagine thinking share float is the only thing that determines price. If you looked at the chart you can easily see that less than 300k shares exchanged hands to push the stock from 4.20 to 4.80 before market even opened today, then maybe less than 5 million shares later it's at 4.90.

In fact this is almost always how large swings in price occur, during premarket or aftermarket. Unless surprise news comes in between during the day. By the time market is live people have already missed out."
2021-04-30 07:28:03,wallstreetbets,"Yep, Nokia is more of Cisco + Ericsson.

Yes they license their name to HMD Global for Nokia-branded Smartphones. They also license the name to some Smart TVs. They do not manufacture or design any of this."
2021-04-30 06:01:58,wallstreetbets,And NOK is overtaking ERIC in contracts and Huawei is a no go in the west.
2021-04-29 23:45:49,wallstreetbets,"grab for january 2023 as well. still super cheap, and bound to print."
2021-04-30 00:58:40,wallstreetbets,But today it went up 12% on good news like it should
2021-04-30 06:46:06,wallstreetbets,"I have a 5G phone with 56GB plan. Much cheaper than you would think. About the same price as my historic plans over the years.

I can get 290Mb/s, which is better than my home broadband."
2021-04-30 00:59:15,wallstreetbets,"It hit 9 this year, what are you talking about?"

2021-04-30 03:54:01,wallstreetbets,"I also bought $7 calls around the same time, but for Jan 2023. I got fisted so hard when nobody could buy it."
2021-04-30 09:53:43,wallstreetbets,What do you mean nobody was allowed to buy it?
2021-04-30 07:14:43,wallstreetbets,I would not be shocked to see these print within 3 months. The target price upgrade spam today was pretty epic.

2021-04-30 17:27:34,wallstreetbets,"NOK has been a pretty stable stock (barring the meme run-up), since I already own the shares I try to pick days that are a bit more volatile to write a call against my shares, effectively lowering my total cost of those shares.

2021-04-30 10:05:15,wallstreetbets,"NOK was one of several stocks that robinhood (and many others) blocked retail buys and allowed only sells, back in the GME clusterfuck of late January.

I'd bought and sold near the top, then like an idiot put it all back in when they tanked the price, it gapped up so hard at yesterdays open my GTC sell order that was supposed to break even filled for about 15% gain."
2021-04-30 15:55:56,wallstreetbets,Ok
2021-04-30 15:55:44,wallstreetbets,Cool story.
2021-04-30 09:49:48,wallstreetbets,Nice! I was pretty strategic and got in at avg cost of like 0.75 :)
2021-04-30 06:20:36,wallstreetbets,"o what is this their full yearly income statement....

to make 21 billion it cost them 13 billion..... 

pre tax income is 700 million... their expected tax payments is 3 billion plus..... making their income negative of 2 billion..... net income from continued operations of..... Negative 2 billion...

STOP looking at fucking EBIT....... 

their earnings per share is still actually negative....

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NOK/financials?p=NOK"
2021-04-30 04:17:28,wallstreetbets,that puts them at around 26 x earnings so at the upper end of their value already
2021-04-30 02:46:31,wallstreetbets,"Everyone who can check NOKs financial statements can see its overvalued......

You even do the numbers for them, but people choose to ignore it. They will rather trust someone whos only valuation is: 
-Theres room to double by the end of the 2021
-Its undervalued"
2021-04-30 00:17:22,wallstreetbets,"From what I remember, Nokia's Q1 has a history of being the worst Q. This just gives hope for long-term investors that the boat is actually turning with the new leadership."

2021-04-29 20:07:30,wallstreetbets,they are starting to buy back shares and plan to do 500m by 2022 I read.. It's not a ton but a start.
2021-04-30 07:35:38,wallstreetbets,Also bad reputation at least in germany for being greedy assholes after they outsourced in 2008.
2021-04-30 08:01:04,wallstreetbets,"If it were me, I‚Äôd look to make the move sometime after Q3 earnings, and roll it up to a higher strike price for next spring (spring 2022 contracts should hopefully be available by then), and/or January of 2023. I like to roll out LEAPs to avoid IV crush, theta decay increases as it gets closer to expiration, and the fact that LEAPs spike a lot more in value during large price moves (which I truly expect to begin for NOK in a sustainable fashion come Q4 2021).

In the meantime, you may also want to consider slowly accumulating 100 shares. The benefit to this is that you can sell weekly covered puts and calls close to expiration and accumulate extra money off the premium. Almost like an extra ‚Äúdividend‚Äù payment to pad your account, and ‚Äúpay off‚Äù some or all of the costs of your LEAPs."
2021-04-30 01:21:37,wallstreetbets,"Honestly no idea. Maybe they think I‚Äôm also trying to say I expect a massive price increase in short order. I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm a long term investor on NOK. Been slowly accumulating shares under $4 for close to a year now with profits from options plays here and there. Q3/Q4 2021 is when I expect a beginning to a ‚Äúmini‚Äù bull run, and the actual bull run in Q2 2022 once a few solid quarters of 5G contract revenue begin to show up in earnings (most the contracts begin the large payments in Q4 2021)."
2021-04-29 21:24:55,wallstreetbets,That's not the correct way to refer to options that far into the future. Since the day of the month doesn't matter. It's Month + Year.

Imagine what the share price would be with half the shares outstanding and how much it would've gone up today. 11% isn't terrible, but it does little to attract new investors when they look at the float and see the 20 years of dilution.

Nokia's transformation reminds me of AMD. Think the CEO before Lisa Sue was Rory Reed. He carried out the retrenchment strategy and the Sue carried on into the growth stage where we saw the massive price increase. Nokias 10k's and restructuring reminds me of AMD. Were already seeing this in the 10-Q.  Q1 is normally a good projection for whats to come during the year. Fundamentals suggest a mid 5 to 6$ move.

2021-04-30 08:58:18,wallstreetbets,"From what I‚Äôve read, the 5G wave will actually last longer than that of 4G. A major driver of this is that we have continents like Africa and Asia with many countries that are still on 3G or transitioning into 4G, so later in the decade, the 5G shift may move to the developing countries as well. The good part about this, is that these countries have so many young people. I would have to say that I am bullish on NOK through at least 2026, but after that it just depends upon what they do in the R&D space through 2024/25."

I have been doubtful of many in the MVIS thread for their complete aversion to negative comments. This is a bad look. ""Do your DD!!!"" is the only reply they have to negativity. Cringeworthy. 

That said, I do believe in this companies tech, problem I'm having now: Does it actually exist? 

The ""proof"" of completion was just a picture. I was really hoping for something more substantial at the EC. A low res pic on a PDF doesn't prove shit. Where is the fancy presentation? Think Tesla or Apple. What is this shitty picture about? 

MVIS sub would be like ""I've held 10 yrs!"". So what? You could have taken heaps of profit and bought back in if you really loved the company so much you'd hold 10 years. Also, it's a completely different company with different tech, people and fundamentals. 

In any case, I'll hold for a while longer yet but am very dissatisfied with their A sample presentation."

Post below copied from ST. **I can confirm it!** Completely overseen the **change in wording**. In the past they were only in discussions and so on. **Last status** before PR only **weeks ago** was ""exploring"".

I would add in addition to Chris, it changed during the few weeks also from

>**alternatives**

to **now**

>**partners**

&#x200B;

Chris pointed also out that it is **plural**, so that there are > 1 possible parties interested in buying at the share price level at the time of the CC, so at > $20.

Buyout was never sooner and likelier than now, Closing likely soon.

1) They have almost finished the Lidar product. In time.

2) The have even set up a prototype production line.

3) Specifications are best-in-class.

4) The Lidar has features that no competitor has.

5) They have a clear product roadmap.

= They have everything (done) that no competitor reached until now and so they are a huge help for any automotive OEM. So, it is very likely that they will be bought out very soon. I think more in days and weeks than in months. And it is not understandable why Luminar is higher valued. I expected more a crash of Luminar and an uptrend for Micorvision.

Problem is here likely the huge short selling. But they have to cover. Extremely oversold. More than 30 % down in few hours. Will end this week above $20."

When WSB gets hold of a stock it seems you get 2-3 days of green then an alright crash, especially when then fundamentals behind the stock are poor like MVIS.

Under $10 I might consider getting back in but they really don‚Äôt earn a lot and won‚Äôt for a while. Most are praying for a buyout that may never happen."

2021-04-29 22:18:09,wallstreetbets,"And thats sad because you dont need to totally understand the data to understand the importance of its products, the developers, team and the CEO. This is the real deal. As long as the CEO is set on making a name for himself we are set. You already know he likes us. He gave us the ""Wednesday Surprise"" so we could get out and cut if we had to. Sad to say us folks who are now share holders ""We"" got to wait a bit. Besides that I am 3000 shares deep into this action but that is my comfort level. And this is a HOMER hold because I am down for the home team ride or die. For all the so called ""losers"", maybe you made somebodys retirement dream happen for them and they take their new found riches and they do at least one good thing for their loved ones and one good thing for society other than paying taxes.

2021-04-30 01:08:49,wallstreetbets,"Bro, they gave their employees 1.2 million in incentives 1st quarter. In what planet do you think they‚Äôre not making money? They are but it goes straight back into the company. That‚Äôs what companies do until they hit gold, which is what MVIS is on track to do."
2021-04-29 20:27:27,wallstreetbets,Bought 10 at 10.33 and sold at 24.24 I feel like I did it decently. Not perfect but still decent
2021-04-29 20:32:25,wallstreetbets,I was the same. Didnt sell because the mvis sub kept hyping the lidar demo/ec as news that will rocket mvis. O well...mvis still boasting their amazing tech though and apparently a buyout might be announced by ford end of may. Holding and buying below 12 until then. Based on the charts mvis seems to bounce back after every dip.
2021-04-29 20:33:16,wallstreetbets,"I feel your pain I was up 1400$ now I'm down $3,000 and don't know what I'm going to wake up to tomorrow I thought the earnings call was going to be a positive one such as life."

Back in at 28. 

Back in at 19. 

Fuck me."
2021-04-29 20:50:19,wallstreetbets,I'm sure they do. And I can definitely see a buyout in their future. Totally wishing the long players nothing but gold.
2021-04-29 20:48:32,wallstreetbets,That's awesome man. Very happy for you.

2021-04-29 20:32:21,wallstreetbets,Bought in it 10.33 for 10 shares and sold at 24 when it was dropping im glad

2021-04-29 20:03:54,wallstreetbets,18 @ 25.50.. So thankful my margin application was delayed i would have been in 10x deeper.

2021-04-29 22:15:23,wallstreetbets,"Wow, wsb has gotten weak"
2021-04-29 20:59:13,wallstreetbets,I thought it was gonna be another GME but I have no faith in any WSB attacks again lol
2021-04-29 20:32:40,wallstreetbets,Oh I hope not
2021-04-29 20:24:27,wallstreetbets,Oh then I‚Äôm not bad at all in that case. It will work out eventually.
2021-04-29 20:44:44,wallstreetbets,Ya I‚Äôm not worried about it really. The way I look at it is money comes money goes. I never use money I need right now anyways. That‚Äôs what a savings account is for. I lost more in Vegas last week lol
2021-04-29 20:48:37,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt believe that at all
2021-04-29 20:50:03,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs cool.. profit is profit
2021-04-29 20:53:58,wallstreetbets,Nope I don‚Äôt do margin. I didn‚Äôt agree to anything lol
2021-04-30 00:08:12,wallstreetbets,Ya that‚Äôs true but it‚Äôs gonna be ok.. I believe that the best comes to those who are patient.

2021-04-29 21:01:40,wallstreetbets,"omg that would make me so happy

I got in at $10 last week when the hype was starting to build again and out at 18-20

I would love to build a nice big position on MVIS"
2021-04-29 21:51:43,wallstreetbets,"I would like to dump mine at this point, although I do agree with most of the long holders that there is money to be made in the future, but today was my biggest red day since I started investing, which has only been a couple of years, I was hoping for a shorter gain to catch a little profits to diversify my portfolio, but there is education here and from the right perspective I suppose that has value."
2021-04-29 23:11:11,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt personally have a position in this, but enjoy following the WSB DD posts from time to time. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but none of the $50+ soon price targets were on the basis of it blowing out earnings. Yes there was some about the possible buyout, but most of what I read into the comments was people liking the technology the company has. They are a legitimate company with a legitimate IP and multiple product lines one of which happens to be related to arguably one of the fastest growing industries in self driving cars. 

Just skimming over the call it sounds like if you bought this because you believed in the long term value or their tech that nothing was said that should shake you. Sure it would have been nice to wake up to a blowout earnings, but basically this call just confirmed everything is on track with the development of its lidar tech. 

From the call;

> ... We expect that a version of this first-generation long-range lidar sensor, after internal and external validation, reliability and compliance testing, could be available for sale, in initial quantities, in the third or fourth quarter of 2021 as we previously reported

People on here reacting like they came out on the call and pulled a ‚Äújust kidding, our shit actually doesn‚Äôt work at all and we‚Äôve got no products, sorry‚Äù, which is something I‚Äôve seen happen multiple times on small cap pharma positions I‚Äôve Owned. If this is the reaction to ‚Äúeverything is on track and earnings were within a penny of what was expected and rev was off by $100k from estimates‚Äù, then I‚Äôd love to see how people react to a drug company coming out and announcing the readout from their new drug actually kills people faster than the placebo or something. 

Meaning to tell me most people on here that claimed they invested in this for the long term because of the innovative tech were actually just in it for the gamble of a quick trade???"
2021-04-30 00:47:06,wallstreetbets,"Both are terrible bets. 

Lets be real, it only went to 30 because of the 10 different get rich quick catalysts people wanted fo believe would happen. And, not one of those people bothered to do their own DD"
2021-04-30 02:41:13,wallstreetbets,9k loss
2021-04-29 20:49:47,wallstreetbets,If his wife‚Äôs boyfriend lets him
2021-04-29 22:54:47,wallstreetbets,"If you look at that link. They list a breakdown of anything monetary related. For Q1 21 they don't have any sales listed. But they do have money made throw licensing which doubled from the last quarter. 

I was also stating they are also going to be effected by the chip shortage that everyone has been talking about as they do not have their own foundries and are a much smaller producer of chips than a lot of other companies. This could impact their availability of having product readily available to sell."
2021-04-30 08:54:44,wallstreetbets,Huh? Wouldn‚Äôt touch something like this with a 10ft pole. Was just curious where the dozens of YOLO‚Äôers went?
2021-04-29 20:45:59,wallstreetbets,"You can't just say ""but yeah this other company who makes a similar thing is worth this much so MVIS should be too"" . Jesus dude don't be so fucking retarded, learn how to do even the most basic fundamental analysis if your going to invest. All these tools on here just wanting to make money off hopium and DD posts by other redditors, this stock was trading at less than a dollar a year ago and benefitted greatly from EV hype pulling up anything even remotely EV related, $1 a share would be a more fitting market cap for this company."
2021-04-29 20:55:05,wallstreetbets,Soon as in how fast it was up and went straight down üòÖ
2021-04-30 01:03:24,wallstreetbets,"No all apes must prosper, that homeless person must not be an ape"

2021-04-29 20:48:36,wallstreetbets,"I'll post something over there, but they aren't going to like it. I'd imagine they will downvote & talk some trash. I just read even further into the company. Their royalty revenue has been cratering for the last few years. I'm not even sure if they have the revenue to manufacture mass quantities of their device. That is IF they can even win some business, which is easier said than done. I also read the device is only just now starting outdoor testing. That is a HUGE red flag. It means it's not going to be ready for prime time for years.....once that testing completes, OEM's test it, & they actually start marketing & quoting it to customers. Now I see why MVIS has been seeking a buyout. It looks like more of a desperation kind of thing, versus building upon their success. Seems to me that a lot of WSB folks put the cart before the horse."
2021-04-29 21:33:51,wallstreetbets,Everything sucks
2021-04-29 21:04:25,wallstreetbets,Agreed
2021-04-29 20:22:54,wallstreetbets,I wish i was
2021-04-29 23:48:55,wallstreetbets,Hard to say. If WSB managed to bump it a bit people would just sell.
2021-04-29 23:14:35,wallstreetbets,It was a very cheap gamble that paid off in spades. Not sure what's up your butt.
2021-04-30 09:27:11,wallstreetbets,"Short term, maybe. But they're poised for big moves going forward. Their tech makes that all but certain, at least. The time it takes for that to bring a lot of value to the company? Probably will match closely with automation production. Maybe 1-3 yrs on long haul before any price bought at on this run up will prove profitable."
2021-04-29 22:04:26,wallstreetbets,Then lets change it up.

2021-04-29 22:25:11,wallstreetbets,"Recently I learned Japanese call that aholding. Aho means idiot. It's when someone keep holding to avoid realizing losses on the distant hope it rises again.  Though meme stocks keep coming back so far, so it might not be that bad."
2021-04-29 22:10:36,wallstreetbets,I love it. Fucking Nokia.
2021-04-30 02:03:04,wallstreetbets,And then please do yourself a favour and don't instantly sell. This is so typical for retail - and directly after you sell stock goes brrrrr
2021-04-30 09:38:19,wallstreetbets,"You missed some opportunities to average down apparently, I got into Nokia around $5 too. Sure, I sharted a few times as it sank back to $4 immediately afterwards but averaged down to $4.50 over a few weeks (months?

2021-04-29 20:54:30,wallstreetbets,"I think the biggest mistake made here, and I got caught right along with it, was expecting the announcement of the lidar's completion to be the catalyst for a massive and quick boom. I think it is a catalyst, but for a medium-long increase towards a new floor price for the stock. And, there could be several events that continue to push that higher, but I don't see any one as being a spark to start an overnight takeoff. As for earnings, I never expected much. Seems like R&D has been were their main focus has been. Hopefully that investment will start to lead to a lot of monetization of their product."
2021-04-29 23:56:47,wallstreetbets,"You could have simply pulled up mvis on yahoo, looked at its last 4 quarters and see that it has had declining revenue quarter after quarter. 

Then, you go and look at their last year of public statements, only a few really matter, and realize that at no point do they mention anything that will generate revenue. 

With 15 minutes of effort, thousands of redditors can be discredited and you‚Äôll have the satisfaction of knowing you figured it out yourself.

It has nothing to do with EV and everything to do with AV and AR. So yes comparing their valuation to LAZR is completely reasonable granted they are not ‚Äúquite‚Äù as far as LAZR in development (LAZR has more units produced and several announced partnerships that have generated minimal revenue and continues to hemorrhage cash than MVIS does 11M vs 6-7M). LAZR has more cash due to their recent SPAC IPO but MVIS can raise more cash as the they did in Q1. They didn‚Äôt bother raising too much because the CEO is actively seeking a buyout.

Microsoft took over production of the mvis chips and are paying mvis royalties now. Previously we were making the display engines ourselves and getting paid for that work as well. But making those had a cost to us so it wasn‚Äôt really the most profitable arrangement. Now if Microsoft scales beyond what we could have done at the time of this deal happening, we get more profit per unit because it‚Äôs just straight cash in our pockets (once the $10M pre-payment is paid down).

2021-04-29 21:58:46,wallstreetbets,I think it would have been if wsb didn‚Äôt pick up on it and push it Friday and Monday.  The question is will wsb let the shorts win or will they fight back and push it up again.  Time will tell...
2021-04-29 22:26:11,wallstreetbets,I've gotten in at the ground floor twice now. Just waiting patiently for my third ride.
2021-04-29 20:00:29,wallstreetbets,"But not with your hands in the air screaming the sky is falling. You run for the hills to either take cover with the women children and elderly or build a fighting position. You take your hit and assess the damage, decide what is next."
2021-04-29 20:02:33,wallstreetbets,"to be fair i thought GME $100 was the most retarded thing i ever seen when people said that, when GME was $20-50.

same when Dogecoin PT was $1 when it was sitting at 0.2

i'm still in shock that it stabilized at 170. but GME was quite a special case."
2021-04-29 22:34:34,wallstreetbets,And to fear airlines
2021-04-29 21:04:45,wallstreetbets,"I bought in today hoping to play earnings on minimal DD.

I fucked up.

Averaged down twice for no godamn reason.

52 @ 18.67"
2021-04-29 21:06:34,wallstreetbets,Yes i pretty much RIP'd those stocks... Just glad it's not a significant amount of money. Funny how things are so different when we look in retrospect.
2021-04-30 00:10:05,wallstreetbets,LOL guys I only have 25 shares üòÇüòÇüòÇ I‚Äôm gonna be ok!!!

2021-04-29 20:27:27,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah double double down
2021-04-29 20:38:36,wallstreetbets,Thats not the real price when the chart backdates it doesn't account for share splits and dilutions that happened along the way
2021-04-30 00:47:12,wallstreetbets,So much misinformation in this thread. The ceo of mvis is getting a paltry salary but 300k shares per year for the next three years. Management is super incentivized to create long term value...
2021-04-30 04:19:59,wallstreetbets,"Firstly, there are plenty of companies that aren't currently profitable that have a potential to be highly profitable in future. Just as many of the most profitable companies now weren't always that way. 

Secondly, saying it hasn't turned a profit in 28 years is both untrue and also disingenuous given that this is nowhere close to the company it was 28 years ago. Microvision has completely shifted it's focus and developments in recent years. 

Thirdly, the focus on revenue for a stock like Microvision is a bit absurd when you consider they are still developing their main products that will generate revenue. There is a good reason the stock has accelerated up over the past year. It is because people believe in the products they are working on and the future revenue they will generate. Or at the least, they believe in their potential value as a company in the future. 

It's fine if people don't want to take risks and are only willing to invest in companies that are already profitable. However, if you believe in the future of LIDAR and autonomous driving, then its also fine to invest in a company like this that you think will be worth a lot more in the future, even if current revenue isn't great. 

I generally agree on the point about insider ownership, it's usually a better sign when it's higher. However it's also not the end all be all. There's even lower than 1% insider ownership for some really good growth stocks (Pinterest, for example)."
2021-04-30 00:37:30,wallstreetbets,Not to mention publicly stating they are open to sell. Nothing says confidence in your company like telling everyone you want to offload it.
2021-04-29 20:23:11,wallstreetbets,Not much and not looking good.....  but I like the stoxk
2021-04-29 23:21:50,wallstreetbets,"maybe I am not quite understanding their relationship with msft and the general market. I very well could be wrong.

I was under the assumption they did more than just be a supplier for hololens. And even if they are a supplier would they still not need to make the actual boards and chips? Or is msft just doing all that and mvis just gets a cut? If the latter then it's strange msft hasn't said fuck it and bought them already. Especially with all these high profile acquisitions they have been doing lately. And all the other large acquisitions happening in the silicon space this past year."
2021-04-30 00:54:11,wallstreetbets,"So you‚Äôve read the DD and still don‚Äôt see the problem. 

Wallstreet does not give a flying fuck about ‚Äúpotential future‚Äù tech and ‚Äúundisclosed‚Äù partnerships. They produce no money, have non-existent institutional ownership, and run on idealistic rumours, aka hopes and dreams. 

Money is all that matters in the stock market. MVIS has shown 0 sign of making any."
2021-04-29 20:58:16,wallstreetbets,Stop smoking overhyped meme stocks you fucking kook
2021-04-30 14:01:36,wallstreetbets,"Why the question mark? Hedge fundies are wanna bee's. They are not the 1%. They are the chaiboys of the 1%. They got nothing but an inheritance and a cyclops-royal family looking brow bridge from the constant inbreeding due to fear of contact with the human race. I would rather stake my earnings rolling deep with APES looking to stomp a hedgy chaiboy. Doing it on my own money, risking my own values. FREEDOM"
2021-04-30 14:22:24,wallstreetbets,"I mean if your with Citadel where the heck iz your  honor. The only Citadel I know is an institution of high integrity; SEMPER FIDELIS. You all either traded in your values, deviated from your mission or are misguided. You got a chance to do something good. You get  make your choice but they will hit the filings for all to see. You are highlighted. More and more people will trickle into this movement and you all will branded like that brother fucking queen from #GOT. Can you believe thas is happened."
2021-04-30 14:39:04,wallstreetbets,"They can run a stock up
Just like they run one down"
2021-04-30 01:03:26,wallstreetbets,Yes their competitors tech the size of luggage racks with a ? on when it will be usable. Meanwhile MVIS is openly mocking them in their PR showing their products sleek design next to a stamp. Yet LAZR is 30.00 and MVIS will actually have product by fourth quarter but okay FUD..
2021-04-29 20:38:03,wallstreetbets,That hurt sir
2021-04-29 22:06:29,wallstreetbets,Are you talking about my massive losses? Rude
2021-04-29 23:27:48,wallstreetbets,Potentially infinitely higher
2021-04-29 22:00:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to be 100, it's looking like they're pussin out."
2021-04-29 21:27:08,wallstreetbets,"yeeeaahhh, I feel your pain.  Got in at $15.46 a while back, considered buying more when it was in the $11 range days prior but didn't.  I went camping the past 2 days without cell phone coverage and when I got back to civilization this afternoon I died inside a bit."
2021-04-30 00:02:32,wallstreetbets,"14 to 28 is 100% profit. 

As an aside, learning to not be greedy in those moments is one of the hardest things. Early on I made that mistake a dozen or more times because its just so tempting to hold for more."
2021-04-29 20:22:51,wallstreetbets,"> Buffet just got lucky bro

Buffet was never after high risk high reward stocks. He simply ignored them."
2021-04-30 07:11:42,wallstreetbets,It was a sign in Feb/March (I even called people names cuz you know...) but now I'm convinced that things are really messed up and people may be able to sell at their price or some other crazy thing will happen. This hype feels almost exactly the same as the bitcoin hype.
2021-04-29 20:04:51,wallstreetbets,Same. But Honestly GME at this point throws all logic and fundamentals out the window. I feel folks keep getting themselves burned on crud like this cause they don‚Äôt realize just how unique GME was and is. If I had a dime for every ticker folks held into the gutter cause a squeeze was guaranteed...
2021-04-29 21:13:57,wallstreetbets,My avg is sitting around the $23.50. Only 20 deep but still. Ooof.
2021-04-29 21:15:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, lucky I'm too poor to have lost a lot. Just enough. lmao"
2021-04-29 20:32:40,wallstreetbets,My moms tells me all the time how proud she is of me
2021-04-29 21:18:35,wallstreetbets,Most stock trackers account for splits.
2021-04-30 07:31:45,wallstreetbets,"I'm not saying this company is worthless, but a 2+ billion market cap is nuts with their financials. If you can afford to buy and hold with the hopes of a buyout then good for you, but we all know that's not what the people complaining about being down 50% were intending to do."
2021-04-30 03:40:47,wallstreetbets,For sure. You cannot lose money if u wont sell
2021-04-29 23:25:22,wallstreetbets,They plan to do more than that but I wasn't aware they had any finalized product they were out there selling to anyone besides msft for holo. Their Lidar test obviously will let them move things along with car companies though.
2021-04-30 01:56:29,wallstreetbets,They aren‚Äôt making money on their partnerships because they signed a deal for essentially a test run of their chip at a low cost because they knew their tech would work. Sure enough it earned the ‚Äúundisclosed‚Äù party a 20B contract from the DoD which will pay royalties far beyond what they originally agreed to. You literally described so many start ups in one large paragraph to include Luminar. Yet Wall Street seems to value their substantially worse hardware because the SPAC hype and some rumors of partnerships that have already begun to fall through. So you‚Äôre completely off base and there‚Äôs no where in the market that substantiates your claims that valuation is tied to purely revenue and profitability.
2021-04-30 01:09:13,wallstreetbets,"This is retarded

Money literally doesn‚Äôt matter at all. It takes around 50 years for a stock to pay you back based on price/earnings. Wall Street is all about speculation of future earnings"
2021-04-30 01:56:05,wallstreetbets,"whoa there, almost thought you were talking about Tesla for a moment"
2021-04-29 21:04:55,wallstreetbets,Buddy I have MVIS puts you meth head im rich
2021-04-29 20:02:42,wallstreetbets,Of course they were real... thats how the stock market works. They post bullshit DD on here to hype up tge stock to raise the price. The information they post was complete bullshit and the people ate it up because lots of idiots are on here thinking everything is the next gme. Now the stock will tank 50% tomorrow and everyone will see it for what it was
2021-04-30 14:35:08,wallstreetbets,Did you just have a stroke?
2021-04-29 22:02:02,wallstreetbets,Appears that way too.  Too bad too people could have made a ton of money!!!
2021-04-29 21:29:13,wallstreetbets,Fuck that's rough. Only upshot is hoping there's another spike from some other rumor mills so you cna drop it for some change. The only worse feeling that seeing that red is selling and seeing it go green after.
2021-04-29 21:28:09,wallstreetbets,"My plan was to buy 200 of MVIS, dump it at the 35-50 point and reload all that into GME. In theory even if GME rose it would still have gained me extra shares. I got greedy and finally killed it and it was enough of a gain for like 2 more shares of GME instead of 20.

But hey, it's still XX more shares than I had. And I'm still in the black overall so I'm better of than a lot of people."
2021-04-30 10:30:30,wallstreetbets,Diversifying like a boss üëç
2021-04-29 20:05:52,wallstreetbets,"If MVIS is getting acquired $25/share is way too low, this was never a short-term play."
2021-04-29 20:21:33,wallstreetbets,Yeah I know dumbass. But they‚Äôre a proven entity in the laser application space that spent years to reinvent themselves and innovate to make their product more applicable to be relevant today effectively making them a start up again. Amazon did a similar thing in the wake of the dotcom bubble crash. Not saying they will have amazon like success but they have years of experience that can help fend off newcomers into the space.
2021-04-29 22:53:26,wallstreetbets,"2001 10-K says the market value of common shares was $130 million. With today's outstanding shares, that would equate to about 82 cents a share. It's high this week at $28 a share gave it a $4.4 billion market cap. I just think if someone were to buy them out, it'd be a real silly time to do it."
2021-04-30 09:12:32,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I would say if people are down 50% they probably FOMO'd in after it had already massively risen and probably didn't do any DD to begin with. Not sure that's ever a great idea"
2021-04-29 23:27:51,wallstreetbets,"Ah ok that makes sense then. I was more under the assumption they already had more that they were selling or even that their hololens stuff was being sold elsewhere.

Now that I think about it my original comment was stupid any ways. Even if they were impacted by the chip shortage you would have probably only seen a partial drop off in sales and not a total drop"
2021-04-30 01:12:02,wallstreetbets,">	money doesn‚Äôt matter at all

Maybe the dumbest thing I have ever heard on here. 

You pretty clearly learned to invest from WSB. The SPY500 is the definition of an investment in capital."
2021-04-30 03:27:19,wallstreetbets,Tesla is absolutely overvalued. They at least have a product and revenue.
2021-04-30 00:00:30,wallstreetbets,"GME literally tanked about 40% on earnings call the same day afer hours as well then spiked back up to the price it was before the drop in two days. Been there and i would definitely buy MVIS once it drops to 10s levels. 

GME went from 200 to 110 after earnings . Then in ONE day back from 110 to 220. People said 'its going back to 40, its over, and such'. Just relax.

Most of the price drop was caused to shorts and they will have to cover. Over 40% loss in one day at earnings after hours is way too obvious. Keep calm and buy when it dis to 10. Should climb back to 20 really fast."
2021-04-30 14:59:44,wallstreetbets,"Stroke from what? I can run 15 miles in row. I got job, family, friends. I'm cool. Man I need to drink some water. My Garmin says I my heart rate is good. Why would I have a stroke. If I did it woulnt matter. I got insurance."
2021-04-29 22:04:06,wallstreetbets,Im just turning it to a long play. They are ahead of everyone else on the market with their tech and it will be valuable for the next huge wave of automation. Dumping the stock now would legit be a dumbass play.
2021-04-30 00:41:53,wallstreetbets,"Your train of thought sounds like you have no confidence in your decisions. If you already think your next trade will lose, you aren‚Äôt investing enough of your time and need to nut the hell up."
2021-04-29 20:42:25,wallstreetbets,That's a lot of words I'm not reading
2021-04-29 22:05:23,wallstreetbets,Agreed.  They have good tech between HL2 and lidar.  I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs taking this long for a buyout or strategic partnership.
2021-04-30 07:36:56,wallstreetbets,You dont understand what i was saying
2021-04-29 20:43:24,wallstreetbets,"Alright actual retard, TLDR: enter new space = effectively a start up"

They are going to smash 2018 numbers and the stock got up to $40.  They also have more production capacity now due to their recent acquisitions.

‚ÄúThanks! Hey I have a question, what if almost every share is shorted?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell that means many people believe the company will not succeed at meeting their projected timelines for revenue and may fail altogether‚Äù

‚ÄúInteresting.... cause on this one place online it turns out that if everyone thinks it will fail it will actually explode in a positive way‚Äù

‚ÄúWell Timmy that‚Äôs a very rare situat-‚Äú

I see by far the #1 fear in NIO being the semiconductor chip shortage. This is called a business threat. Every company out there has these threats, and it‚Äôs the companies that adapt to these threats that come out on top. It‚Äôs clear NIO knows about about this threat - they know it more than anybody, and it‚Äôs obvious they are working on building partnerships and long-term contracts to keep up with production. Luckily this is a threat that is foreseeable and not something which pops up overnight, and so even if the worst outcome happens, it will be a short-term issue instead of a long term issue."

Also, I saw the puts weren't really printing even though the stock was tanking during market, so I thought about it and the max profit on these even if MVIS went to zero would be less than 50%.

I learned buying puts on high IV stocks is just not that worth it even if you get perfect timing. Even if this 20% drop holds tomorrow the puts still won't go up that much because it was implied.

Still stings a bit though when you had the right idea but improper execution."

2021-04-29 22:24:34,wallstreetbets,"I don't want to hate on CLOV but I do want to run some quick numbers because most of you won't but will buy in anyway.

CLOV's expenses are $6.8M. Their non-OPEX deprecation is around $100k. So their net total taxed expenses is around $6.7M.

They are valued at $1.5B. With $6.7M in expenses that's a pretty good ratio. Let's look at their cash flow, sales and revenue.

CLOV cash flow is -2.2M based on short term debts and selling shares to raise funds. Not great. CLOV currently has $28M in cash from selling shares and debts to pull from. Not terrible, not great.

They have $0 in sales and therefore $0 in revenue. MVIS at least had $500k in sales and that's laughable. At this rate, without issuing more shares and taking on more debt, CLOV can last 4 more years. They are making no money and spending millions. From their balance sheet alone this looks absolutely awful. Good luck everyone."

üöÄWe could hear about the Micro LSD trial studying daytime vs evening administration by Dr. Kuypers. It will integrate Albert to evaluate various effects. It would be nice to hear when it's starting.

üöÄWe could hear something about our patents: LSD Neutralizer, and Personalized Patient Dosing (two separate ones for MDMA and LSD), as well as the patent filed after we partnered with Mind Shift.

üöÄThere was a delay with DMT study. It was to begin Q4 2020, and now is slated to start in Q2. It is a Phase 1 study

üöÄLSD vs Psilocybin study (early phase 1) might be wrapping up Q2.

2021-04-30 01:25:27,wallstreetbets,Don't buy a put just stay away from earnings because you'll almost always lose to IV crush either way. I tested it buying a call at close and profited a whopping $20 selling it immediately at open. The option's premium collapsed within the first minute. It's just not worth the risk for so little potential return.
2021-04-29 21:52:42,wallstreetbets,Was about to sit down for dinner.

2021-04-30 11:35:13,wallstreetbets,"Interesting- that sounds a lot like an M&A risk assessment/security uplift. I hadn't considered that VCs would be running that sort of due diligence too.

Is the in-house model due to confidentiality/conflict of interest concerns with using services providers like Mandiant, Bishop Fox, etc?"

2021-04-30 11:47:50,wallstreetbets,"Nothing like that re: COI.

I built my company with one very simple philosophy:  I only want the absolute best, and I will overpay 15% to get it (among other benefits) to ensure the best stays with me and will follow me through the gates of hell if I ask.  Mercenaries/VARs/etc. run counter to that belief system, especially in the talent department.  So I hire in-house and trust that my willingness to not optimize my operational expenses will pay larger dividends in the final results.  

Has worked for me for a long time, so I'm not about to stop now."

You do know that tens, hell maybe hundreds of thousands of people bought into GME when it was sub 50$. That would make them what exactly? Not bag holders that's for certain. Do you think all those people just sold their position? Why are you equating GME with somehow bag holding anyway? Does it look like the stock is somehow crashing? Did you buy in at the top and are now big mad about it? Where exactly is this hate for GME coming from?"

2021-04-30 02:07:10,wallstreetbets,I'm going to put a reminder as well so we can both come back.
2021-04-30 09:24:39,wallstreetbets,"We all have opinions like we have buttholes, go wash yours."
2021-04-30 02:07:47,wallstreetbets,good bot
2021-04-30 09:26:17,wallstreetbets,You corrected someone on their grammar but can‚Äôt take being corrected yourself. Oof.
2021-04-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"T MINUS 30 MINUTES - Last call to buy calls. AMZN earnings at market close today. Fundamentals & Technicals look 5-Star. Split would add jet fuel. DD below. Technically it looks like a 5-star set up on a chart heading into their earnings today. Been in a channel for 8 months. Sitting at ATH's right now waiting for a reason to break out. A big earnings beat sends it higher or a split sends it higher. I bought calls before the split rumor so that would just icing on the cake.

Anyone who thinks mega cap companies can't break out look at FB, up 7% today.

I follow lots of hedge fund guys on Twitter and they're all sharing the same article of this hedge fund guy Bill Miller saying AMZN will double in Barron's and they're all just waiting for a reason to send it higher. [https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311](https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311)

If there's an earnings beat then over the next few weeks analyst after analyst will trip over each other upgrading their PT's which'll also send it higher. Analysts don't downgrade AMZN. They either keep their previous ratings or they upgrade. [https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast)

If we get any kind of good news Thursday AMZN will have $4k+ upside in the next month. $5k upside in the next 2 months.

I've done a lot of time doing DD on this and I think it's a rate 5-star situation so I wanted to bring it to the fam. ü¶ç Haven't pitched an idea here before cuz this is the first really 5 star risk/reward bet I've found.

I think calls are the move since we're either in for sideways or üöÄüåï.

As for the Split rumor, if it's true it would be huge. [https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544](https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1386734121607745544)

If there's a 6 to 1 or more split I bet we see +10% tomorrow even on average earnings. If we get an earnings beat plus a split then we're talking a once in a lifetime move for a biz their size - maybe 50% gains in the 1-2 months. **Last time it consolidated this long the leg up was +100% and took 2-3 months**. If they don't have numbers that get them there they will likely play the Split card. They know they need a breakout after the last 8 months and with a new CEO. Their last earnings was actually amazing but the stock didn't go because of the Bezos news. A big reason its stalled is the fact that it's 4k freaking dollars. A split means retail can jump in on shares & call options.

A split isn't needed at all though for a break out. **Keep in mind the split rumor isn't priced in. It popped 0.8% when the rumor broke and then settled back down later the same day.**

The last thing that needed to fall into place was yield expectations for the next month and Powell's meeting yesterday should help in that regard.

I'm thinking **June 4 @ $4,000 strike** for price / expiry.

**Going to war in t minus 30 minutes.** Would love to have fam beside me. What say you?

*Obviously not advice I just really like the stock.*"

2021-04-30 09:07:34,wallstreetbets,"Update on the ""theoretical price"" and IV crush. We might be in the clear. I'm using TD, and perhaps it's just the way that ThinkOrSwim calculates the greeks in after hours which pushed the theoretical price down, since there are no bids/asks. But as of this morning. My strike, and your strike, and both \[theoretically\] green.

I'm not getting good vibes from today, so my plan is to sell at open, take whatever I can. I believe AMZN will see $4000 in the coming months, but today isn't the day to hold, not for me."
2021-04-29 20:43:19,wallstreetbets,"I knew, just like you did, and probably half the world, that AMZN would crush earnings. UPS did, SHOP did, so obviously AMZN would. I bought 1 call for 6/18 $3750. But I'm a little concerned. Please refer to this image: 

[https://imgur.com/a/Qk3IgTV](https://imgur.com/a/Qk3IgTV)

All day the ""theoretical option price"" ran in line with the bid-ask spread, just like any option, on any day. But right at close, the theoretical price dropped from \~50 to \~30, rose with the pop, but then fell right back in line with the 4pm close price (even though AMZN ended at 8pm EST about 100 points higher). And so the option appears to be unchanged. $50 at close, and ""theoretically"" $50 even after the gap up.

I'm concerned because I saw this same thing with AMD, even though I wasn't in it. AMD gapped up close to 90, but many options were unchanged the follow open. This was one reason I bought a moderately long dated call, but I'm worried now that I'm looking at IV crush, and thinking that since obviously AMZN would beat, everyone knew, and it was priced in. Really hoping I wake up tomorrow to a further gap up, otherwise, I (or we) might be selling flat."

2021-04-29 22:42:59,wallstreetbets,"Overall, very strong numbers. Above wall street consensus expectations across the board, but to be honest, not as mind blowing as I thought was possible.

For some context here's how I'd rate this week of big tech earnings.

GOOGL ü§Ø ü§Ø ü§Ø ü§Ø

MSFT ü§Ø ü§Ø

NFLX üí©"
2021-04-29 23:36:24,wallstreetbets,What do you think about BABA?
2021-04-29 21:17:41,wallstreetbets,"You are correct. OP did a great analysis, but failed to consider Vega. All stocks drop in IV sharply after earnings, and the call he suggested has a Vega of 2.27 and a Delta of 0.12. That means that assuming a ""typical"" 5 pp post-earnings drop in the IV you would need an increase of $80 from the underlying just to offset Vega loss. Then you have Theta of -$92 which means that depending on when OP purchased his call, he might actually open tomorrow in the red. That's the drawback of buying deep out of the money calls."
2021-04-29 20:42:51,wallstreetbets,lolll got a bit excited.

2021-04-29 21:40:30,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately market makers knew exactly what they were doing when selling any calls. They rode AMZN down perfectly in AH to offset any gains of call options. Unless we get back to 3600 in the morning, we‚Äôll barely have any gains due to IV crush, and will need to sell immediately at open otherwise be in danger of going too red. Sorry to be the bad news bears here."

2021-04-29 23:06:23,wallstreetbets,"It's honestly a lot simpler than it sounds. Check this link out:

https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/option-greeks/options-vega-the-greeks.html

Particularly when taking options through earnings, you need to consider that the increased volatility that a security's price will experience is priced in. Look at it from a buyer's perspective. You wouldn't pay the same price for a contract that has a chance to increase in value significantly due to a particular event, vs one that has no known catalytic events in the horizon.

What OP tried to do was get cheap exposure to earnings of a very expensive stock, but no such thing exists. If he had purchased an slightly OTM call option he would have probably been able to rake in significant profits tomorrow, but his cost and therefore his risk would have also been significantly higher. Here, the contract was initially affordable, but his chances of making a profit drop accordingly."
2021-04-29 23:11:49,wallstreetbets,"The whole thing is a crapshoot, imo."
2021-04-30 00:32:45,wallstreetbets,"awesome, I watched this video and I still have no idea."
2021-04-30 08:37:44,wallstreetbets,"Love it, appreciate the link and explanation! Watching videos today! Makes sense, new to options and have done much better on non-earnings plays."
2021-04-30 07:28:48,wallstreetbets,Think of it this way. Plane tickets to the bahamas during raining season are cheaper because no one wants to take the risk that their vacation will be rainy and shitty. OP bought the rainy season tickets.

2021-04-30 02:06:08,wallstreetbets,Are you asking for reasoning or are you asking what a stock split is
2021-04-30 03:56:34,wallstreetbets,"A stock split is a way for Tesla to lower the stock price so accessibility to the stock will be better and the market cap won't take a hit. Last year Tesla had a stock split at a ratio of 5:1. So for every stock, you have those will be multiplied by 5. So you get 5 stocks instead of 1, but the value of your stock is also divided by 5. (most of the times however the stock price will increase shortly after a stock split so stock owners will benefit greatly from a stock split)."
2021-04-30 07:48:33,wallstreetbets,"selling a call means you sell someone the option of buying 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price) on or before a certain date (expiration date)

ex.  i sell a call for stock abc, strike price of $10, expiration of may 21.  the current stock price is $9.  

someone buys this because they like abc and think the price will rise beyond $10 before may 21.  if it does, they can sell the now more valuable option contract for a profit or choose to ‚Äúexercise‚Äù - buy their 100 shares at $10/share. then they can turn around and sell them for the now higher market price, or keep the shares long term. 

now, a *covered* call means i sold that contract to you while i already own 100 or more shares of abc.  maybe ive had those a while and i wouldnt mind selling them at $10/share anyway.  i get your premium (the price i sold the option for) and the money for selling 100 shares of abc at $10/share.   the potential downside is that if abc moons to a much higher price, i could have just kept my 100 shares and sold it at the market price rather than 10/share plus my option premium.  i still profit, just not as much as i would have selling at the high market price. 

this is opposed to selling a naked call in which i *dont* already own the 100 shares of abc. 

now if that stock hits say $15/share and my $10 call that i sold gets exercised - i have to buy 100 shares at market price ($1500) and sell them to the option holder for $1000.  i still got the money for selling the option (premium) but i lost $500 from the contract being exercised, which is likely still a net loss.  now imagine abc was a meme stonk and it mooned to $200/ share...üòÇ"
2021-04-30 01:02:49,wallstreetbets,"Nah, covered calls is like a call but more stupid, because it limits your profit.
Selling calls is getting money by lending your shares."
2021-04-30 13:41:26,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-30 11:25:11,wallstreetbets,"Reasoning. Yeah, I don‚Äôt see them doing another stock split for a while now. Maybe after it reaches pre last stock split prices? It‚Äôs entirely possible down the road but not now. It would create a mini revolt of investors. Look how many people want Amazon to do a stock split and still they push forward."
2021-04-30 11:26:39,wallstreetbets,Again for me it wouldn‚Äôt make sense to do it at this price when they just had a stock split at a even higher price last August.

2021-04-30 11:34:35,wallstreetbets,"It depends. Because lets say Tesla does a new stock split, then the new stock price will be somewhere about 150 dollars. 150 dollars is for a lot of retail investors much more obtainable. Maybe they don't invest in Tesla right now, because the price is too high for them. The market cap doesn't change for Tesla, so therefore it might be beneficial."

Also, stock price and the health of a company are not always correlated.  But please, feel free to short TSLA and post your positions here ü§£"
2021-04-30 02:53:56,wallstreetbets,"I mean I will trade anything that will make me money and it's been a cash cow for me for years. Say what you want but it will keep going up. When I say technicals I literally mean technicals, macd, rsi, ema's etc, long term it's still on a massive uptrend and that's really unlikely to change. Just look at the monthly timeframe on whatever charting software you use. I've been shorting it recently but still bullish long term, unlikely that it doesn't see 1k share price within a year.

If you think you know better than Cathy Woods over at ARKK maybe you should go manage your own fund and short tsla, im sure your clients will be very happy with the ror."

Yeah, it's all just bullshit to make yourself believe in bullshit. And because enough people believe the bullshit, they keep piling in money rewarding people who are scamming them.

It's really just a circular argument. The technicals are what they are because people believe the bullshit that are the technicals.

Also, shorting is not the opposite of going long, therefore calling Tesla a bullshit fake bubble stock does not mean shorting it will be successful. 

It's possible that both shorts and longs lose most of their money."

2021-04-30 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"HERON THERAPEUTICS (HRTX) FDA APPROVAL, MY UNICORN Likely FDA approval for its most promising drug, HTX-011, on 05/12/2021 gives a strong buy opportunity.

**Company Overview**

**Heron Therapeutics (HRTX \~$17.6) is a small-cap pharmaceutical company (\~$1.6B market cap) focusing on two main areas:** Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting through their CINV franchise and Post-operative pain through HTX-011 and HTX-034.

* CINVANTI & SUSTOL are FDA-approved antiemetic treatments that delay nausea and vomiting. CINVANTI is an established brand among clinics and has captured 40% market share.
* **HTX-011**: first non-opioid post-operative pain treatment drug that has passed Phase 3 trials and is currently waiting for FDA approval with deadline on 05/12/2021
   * Utilizes a combination of bupivacaine and meloxicam to treat post-operative pain through local anaesthesia and decreasing the inflammatory response
   * Attempts to capture the huge market for non-opiod pain killer, $1B+ market

**THIRD TIME'S A CHARM**

**Two previous times were delayed with Complete Response Letter but never because of a safety concern with the drug.**

* April 2019, 2020 CRL (denial) was related to a manufacturing facility issue, which has by now been fully cleared
* November 11, 2020 CRL was also related to non-clinical issues. (Concerns over levels of three excipients in the formulation, all of which have been around and are considered safe)
* 90% of applications subject to extension were approved by PDUFA deadlines given

**WHY BUY, NOT TOO LATE**

* Upon approval, HTX-011 becomes the post-operative pain management SOC (standard-of-care) in a more than $1B annual market
* Priority on ex-US approvals and commercialization
* Analyst consensus shows nearly 200% upside potential
* **HTX- 011 approved by European Medical Agency (EMA), opening up international markets**
* **Canada approved HTX-011 for use in 2020.**

**BALANCE SHEET**

* HRTX only has $5.62M in debt, but $71M in cash, and $320M in short term investments (not highly leveraged) 
* Total short-term liabilities, including debt, is $96.7M, far below Heron‚Äôs short-term assets and cash $40M 
* Net increase in cash (steadily increasing)

**RISKS**

* Several critical components used in manufacture of CINVANTI, SUSTOL, and HTX-011 come from a single vendor, which, if disrupted, would clearly be problematic
* Slow releases of data and confounding from COVID-19 have made HRTX stock trade wildly
* HRTX was already known for providing minimal information to investors, in reality, the company remains on track to succeed

**POSITION DISCLAIMER**

* $13 Call 06-18
* 1000 shares

**TD;DR**

* **Heron Therapeutics HRTX buy for 05/12/2021 FDA approval for non-opiod post-operative pain relief HTX-011**"
2021-04-29 21:25:23,wallstreetbets,"Im not trying to talk it down. In fact, im probably going to place a bet on this one. But, i want to help you solidify your financial analysis with my quick 45 second view of it. They are currently burning about 170m of cash on operations per year on average. They issued stock 2 out of the last 3 years to cover this cash burn. If they get approval, they will face a working capital crunch, which means they will temporarily burn cash even faster as they ramp up production (its just the nature of the beast in this type of situation). They will have to issue new shares or debt. New shares will result in dilution, but this can also work to your advantage if you play it properly. If they don't get approval or if it is felayed, they will still need to issue new stock, and that will obvously be much less favorable. That is my $0.02 on it."

This company called vaxart (VXRT) is a company based in the Bay Area who focuses on oral recombinant vaccines, such as influenza, norovirus, hpv, and most importantly at this time, coronavirus. 

The crazy thing is that not many people care to understand science, but if you read the presentation from 3/25/2021, it may help profusely:  https://investors.vaxart.com/static-files/560116e8-db25-42df-865e-0ed57b8d129a

The company released an 8k on February 3rd, 2021, which highlights the Janssen collaboration agreement. This collab agreement let's Janssen (owned by JnJ) use their influenza antigen and put it in vaxart pill. The final sentence reads, ""Upon delivery of the report, Janssen has a three-month option to negotiate an exclusive worldwide license to the Company‚Äôs technology encompassing the Janssen antigens. Janssen has not notified the Company whether it will exercise this option."" 3 months is 90 days. 90 days from Feb 3 is May 4th (https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxart-enters-research-collaboration-janssen-evaluate-oral)

The pill was put the test against the leading injectable for the flu, sanofis fluzone . Studies showed that even though Sanofis Fluzone had 10x more antibodies, Vaxarts/Janssens flu pill worked 8% better at preventing influenza because of the heavy amount of T-cells and activating mucosal membranes. Oh yeah, this was funded by BARDA also, so the government knows all about them. 
https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/results-influenza-challenge-study-published-lancet-infectious

Back to may 3rd...vaxart last week announced that they are having a Stanford University T-cell expert to discuss cross-protection against variants. https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxart-host-key-opinion-leader-webinar-importance-t-cell

The NEXT DAY, may 4th, Vaxarts Chief Scientific Officer, Sean Tucker, Ph.D., will present at the upcoming World Vaccine Congress Washington that will be held virtually from¬†May 4-6, 2021. The¬†World Vaccine Congress¬†is the largest, most established meeting dedicated to¬†vaccines. From basic research to commercial manufacture, this one meeting covers the whole¬†vaccine¬†value chain where science, government and manufacturers all come together to create groundbreaking progress. Here is a link of speakers : https://www.terrapinn.com/conference/world-vaccine-congress-washington/speakers.stm

These room temperature stable tablets can be shipped overseas to India and Brazil, and all other spots of the world cheaper, easier, without vaccination sites, without fear of needles, (which accounts for 18% of the population of the US alone.), which enables cross variant protection while activating musocal immunity.

Another benefit is they are environmentally friendly. No need for disposal of hundreds of million plastic syringes. 

There is much more Due diligence you could find, such as googling ""richetti brothers vaxart"", ""lodi&the world s2e1"" <<<< Atwill claiming 1 billion pills by years end, and much much more, but that's enough for now. 

Another important note is that on February 3rd, 2021, vaxart dropped 60% and continued to fall from 25 to 5. This was due to investors knowing about money, not the science. Once they realize they can't compare MRNA technology to their VAAST technology, this thing will BLOW. Example: the influenza studies.

Side note: HUGE MISCONCEPTION. MERCK, PFIZER(pill), RIDGEBACK, REMDESIRIVIR, all those are THERAPEUTICS AND ANTIVIRALS. THEY WORK SYSTEMICALLY. THIS IS A VACCINE. A PREVENTION FROM THE VIRUS ENTERING YOUR SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. 

Side note 2: their building is connected to Janssen with a skybridge. Literally. AND they've increased their employee headcount by 500% in a year with 34 pending positions on LinkedIn. Once those positions are filled, 825% increase in employees. Since may 2020. https://gyazo.com/0691603a06d2a651847b7751af9bc9ab

2021-04-29 21:31:00,wallstreetbets,Comparing Vaxart to anyone else is like comparing Netflix to Blockbuster. Ferrari to Kia. Amazon to Wish. You guys get the point. The VAAST platform will change how vaccines are administered and pandemics are handled for the rest of time.

VAXART - Hold the ice (and the Needles!)

Imagine receiving your vaccine as a pill üíä sent to you by mail. Or delivered by drones to your distant village. No freeze boxes required, no nurses to administer any needles. No more ruining the environment with empty syringes. No more complicated logistical problems slowing down the aim, the endgame, which is herd immunity. You just take the pill with a sip of water, done.

VAXARTüëëüíä Advancing a technology named VAAST, which aims to create oral pill vaccines that are room temperature stable, effective and easily distributable.

Pipeline has so far demonstrated excellent results regarding the covid19 vaccine/norovirus/universal flu studies.

Covid19 vaccine phase 2 expected to start during Q2. Oral tablet, room temperature stable, eliminates any problems with logistics. Will be a key solution to vaccinate the developing world & boost the developed world. Emphasis is on it‚Äôs ability to target the S & N proteins, thus be effective even against any kind of mutations. Because believe me, this virus mutates, and it does so fast.

Possible collaboration with JNJ on the universal flu? Awaiting JNJ response, deadline approx 3rd May.
Newly rented building next to JNJ with a bridge connecting the 2 buildings.

Possible funding by governments outside the US?
Biden advisor Richetti‚Äôs brother is lobbying to get Vaxart funding.

Active recruitment ongoing, many newly hired employees and available positions. Since Mid-March they have added enough postings to double their workforce and almost 50% of those hires would be in Quality Control and Manufacturing for a company that does not have a product yet.

Financial stability to survive on its own for a long time without outside funds.

They have really stepped up their PR game and are more transparent on social media.

2 conferences and 1 ER expected in early May.
Vaxart will welcome T-cell expert Mark Davis, Ph.D., Stanford University School of Medicine, to report on the importance of T-cell immunity in COVID-19 vaccines (3rd of May).

Great DD being done on Stocktwits, join us there!

2021-04-29 21:32:07,wallstreetbets,"The T-cell response was only seen in 75% of phase 1 participants. This is the body‚Äôs initial response to any foreign invader: virus, bacteria, etc. However, there was no antibody response detected. For a vaccine to be effective, the T-cell response needs to generate a downstream B-cell (a.k.a. plasma cell) response to serve as the body‚Äôs ‚Äúmemory‚Äù to detect the antigen (the covid S and N proteins in Vaxart‚Äôs instance) if/when it is encountered. I think the extrapolation from here is self-explanatory. As an anesthesiologist, I wouldn‚Äôt take this pill. If they can work out the B-cell issue, they‚Äôll be sitting on a goldmine. 

In regards to the first ‚Äúside note‚Äù: this is wrong. Pfizer, Moderna, J&J; all these are vaccines. Vaccines do not work by preventing the virus from entering the body. They work by preventing the virus from doing damage once they do enter the body."

This tech should be shared for free so everyone can get it without fighting eachother for it. It just prolongs the pandemic for the world so people can make a quick buck....

2021-04-30 08:41:07,wallstreetbets,Stupidly overvalued company. Interesting tech but sooooo far from bringing a product to market in any reasonable capacity. The head-to-head comparisons are nonsense. The real claim to fame is the potential ease of manufacturing and transport if they're successful. Good luck recruiting for the next phases after most of the population in the U.S. is vaccinated now that JNJ is back on. Maybe they can run a trial in India and pray that some new mutant doesn't crop up.

2021-04-29 20:08:24,wallstreetbets,"Well...what did they say about the neutralizing antibodies in 100% of the 2-dose participants? 

I'll answer for you. They found antibodies. Welcome to media manipulation."
2021-04-29 20:21:18,wallstreetbets,"Because our vaccine uptake rates are still nowhere near 100% - there are and will remain a high number of people who don't want to take a jab, and often those same people are much more comfortable with taking a pill.

2021-04-30 09:03:08,wallstreetbets,"Not overvalued at all and not far from this tech being used. They are deep in phase two testing already and they likely will sell their process and license to other companies, not just for covid, they were already in phase two on their flu pill before moving to covid.

Covid won't go away there will be a new vaccine every year and they have already shown that their pill also works on new strains. What they are developing though is the method of delivery into the body for absorption so if it works its big for all vaccines. 

US is not the target audience when talking about something that needs no needles or refrigeration, its other countries around the world, there is money in other places.

Funny to say its overvalued when you seem pretty ignorant on what they are doing."

2021-04-30 08:57:22,wallstreetbets,"There's still a lot of trial time left to market for anything in their bag of tricks, even in our fast-track Covid world. I love their results from the 2019-20 H1N1 phase 2 trial, but 2020-21 was a lousy time to determine efficacy for influenza (if they even attempted it). It feels like a long play with a lot of short term hype. Easily a $40 stock / buyout if their HPV and they can get a quadravalent equivalent influenza to market. Add $5-10 more if the norovirus pans out (I will probably never take a cruise, but if a nv vaccine existed I wouldn't cruise without one). Do you have 5-7 years to tie up your capital?

(It sounds like I'm dumping on them, but I'm picking up 0dte itm calls and hoping to burn a day-trade tx in my casino account; I'd buy 5/7 but I'm short on cash, and I think the presentation is going to be a profit taking event, not a run-up)"

2021-04-30 12:56:57,wallstreetbets,"well it got past stage 1, which is safety

make your own decision, but I suggest ITM >>1mo

bear case: they have an incredible conjugate to pair w existing vax to broaden response to variants and boost duration"
2021-04-30 04:47:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, like for example the UK will pay $15 a vaccine so someone else can pay Covax $1 my concern from a shares stand point is if these are only to supply to covax countries theyll have a huge cash flow but not much net profit, but if as OP states this is a true vaccine then potentially it would be taken by everyone even if theyd had the vaccines on offer now. Whole thing is very interesting to me, and the yolo possibility is only a smal %age of my interest but hopefully for many reasons  this one üöÄ"
2021-04-30 04:57:47,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the suggestion, Im already on high dose niacin, my god the flush is something else! .. The other easy to get hold of helpful thing is an anti hystamine because the immune system over reacts its trying anything it can to fight. Ive been unlucky in some ways in that I had it so early no one knew what to do with me when my symptoms kept coming but on the plus side its meant Ive been involved in focus groups and feeding symptoms in to studies etc. so Ive had some really good info but still not that much help. The brain fog / dementia / post viral fatigue stage was the worst which thankfully Im through, but from the second wave so many are just getting to that stage. If you know anyone at that point and they have the money - please get them to look up Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy. I found out about it late on but Im trying to get the word out abit because it can take you from feeling like being suffocated inside your own mind to clarity. Unbelievable, but proper approved studies etc for long covid havent even been funded yet let alone finished. (Sorry this was a long reply but I do appreciate your suggestion its nice when people try help and if I can share things Ive found to help anyonr Im happy too)"

2021-04-30 08:46:57,wallstreetbets,They just spam the shit out of the posts and spend money to buy awards to get it on the WSB front page. Been happening for months now unfortunately.
2021-04-29 20:55:15,wallstreetbets,">r post is very focused on covid. Overall T-cell boost is much more valuable than whatever this shelf stable pill does against covid. They've like half a dozen shelf stable pill vaccines in the pipeline for various things. 18% of America avoids vaccines because of shot

the DD is literally titled covid vaccine.  So yes I am mainly addressing the covid case.  I'm not disagreeing with the fact that they witnessed T cell boost, but it's more valuable in what way?  They had lackluster results with other secondary endpoint like antibody titers, which is a proven metric in vaccine efficacy.  But do we have any data with primary end point for T cell boost as prophylaxis for targeted disease state?  There's a lot of promising therapies that in theory work but fail to meet primary end point in phase 3 trials.  If boosted immune response is all you want you could literally just give people adjuvants and essentially make people immune, but the results are transient which is not what you want with a vaccine.  

Yes, patients avoid vaccines for no other reason than it's a needle and they don't want to be poked.  I didn't disagree with this.  But oral vaccines are notorious for having lackluster results and it's due to the nature of how vaccines and our immune system work.  Yes there's many oral vaccines in pipeline but like I said how many do you see that are FDA approved?  There's plenty of papers that talk about why oral vaccines rarely work.

I'm not saying that OP doesn't make good points, I'm merely presenting the bear perspective that isn't addressed in OP."

2021-04-30 04:43:57,wallstreetbets,"Anything‚Äôs possible - much like the +60% drop in share price in a single day (Feb 3, 2021). Aside from the Janssen news, there aren‚Äôt really any catalysts until Q2 when the company BEGINS phase 2. With news of newly emerging strains, likelihood of a 3rd vaccine to keep antibody titers up, and the issue in India, I‚Äôm hopeful that the practicality of Vaxart‚Äôs approach will be seen as a highly viable option - since their tablet also contains the spike protein, which should aid with more broad immunity."

Could you explain about that a little more? Maybe I'm being dense about the science behind this, but I'm genuinely curious as this vaccine could be a massive deal!"

2021-04-29 21:09:51,wallstreetbets,"They are proteins of a virus that cover the virus, but cannot replicate (DNA part is missing). That's how the immune system recognizes an actual virus and builds up an immunity to the said virus. Old technology. The newer mRNA style vaccines that were in development for the past 20 years, and were essentially forced by COVID to push the envelope are even more simpler and safer responses. They are even smaller parts of the said virus vaccine that forced the immune system to first create the spike proteins of the COVID (using your muscle tissue system), and it's even more safer. Not only they are not even close to the virus but are just the spike proteins that trigger an immune response with antibodies for the virus should you get infected."

2021-04-30 10:27:21,wallstreetbets,"It (the overvalue story) is a long back-look story. The company has a 30 yr history and something that went well in the past which gave it great numbers. I didn't read up on it - OP would have more info - but I'm guessing it was a patent that eventually expired  or had a competitor enter the market, diluting the value. Meh.

Is it overvalued for today's earnings? Sure. Every company that has amazing potential and exciting research, but no concrete product, probably  is.  And the 100% runup in the last week just makes it moreso.  The conference next week will be all hat and no cattle. BUT, if/when they can get Phase 3 trials complete, with good efficacy, then they'll be printing money. It's interesting that their manufacture method is ""proprietary"" but does not appear to be patented. That's a downside concern for me. 

&#x200B;

tl;rd - I've already bought and sold my options at the time of this writing. I made \~37% in 30 minutes.  I'll keep an eye on the company, but I suspect it will have a buy opportunity over the summer as the lack of news drags on and the shine of a snazzy presentation in DC wears off."

This is a 1 of a kind product that the CSO has been working over 20 years on... they have patents for their formulation and they have a good sized pipeline with other vaccines in the making.

They have more than enough money on hand to fund their clinical trials well into next year.

They only have 120 million shares floating with a current market cap of a little over a billion... 

conservatively, once the covid vaccine gets approved for EUA towards the end of the year... we could be looking at a conservative guess of 10 bil market cap... with potential of alot more... meaning this could easily hit 90-100+ by the end of the year...

Novavax is in a similar place, they have not produced a product, ever... they have not even received an EUA... and their product requires to injections.. which is a logistical nightmare.. their Market cap is over 17 billion pre EUA...

hope this helped."

2021-04-30 07:18:25,wallstreetbets,"Man, your taking my point to some crazy place. I get what your saying. Obviously you can't have a business with no income lol.... my point is DONT make it a business in the first place. Countries share science all the time for FREE. Every allied nation could easily share the recipes for the vaccines for free so everyone could make them in house for themselves... as much as needed, as fast as possible. 

Btw: Moderna, Pfizer, J&J etc... these are drug companies who make a hell of alot more than vaccines lol... they can afford it and still be able to pay their employees quite well, benefits etc.. plus fat bonuses for the management regardless of charging people for those vaccines. 

But by monetizing, you create a business... that business wants to make profit. The direct result of that is that vaccines don't get into people very fast, more of a trickle (except for places like the states who have ample supply and a bill in place so people there get them first, and for free lol) which is only prolonging this nightmare pandemic for EVERYONE, and letting the virus spread, mutate etc. Variants come from spread. Let that keep happening so people can make a quick buck, that's playing with fire. Soon or later (probably sooner) there will be a variant that is immune to vaccines. If that happens, the entire world goes back to the very beginning of all this, but in a far worse position. No ammo to fight back. We will be overrun before we can mount a proper defense. 

You are probably in the states. The states has been making vaccines and stockpiling them since the beginning, you guys all got yours because of the thing trump signed saying that all the vaccines you guys were making stay in house and go to the people first, only after herd immunity is reached would you guys be allowed to give others the vaccines. So I get it, from your guys point of view... you never experienced the problem I'm laying out. But atleast 80 other countries were not making the vaccines for themselves and are forced to buy from whoever has the recipe. This slows down the entire vaccine rollout for the world, giving the virus more time to mutate. It's dumb and short sighted thinking."
2021-04-29 20:59:53,wallstreetbets,"To your point. Their science is strong both for covid and influenza. For covid they might be a little late to the party, however that all depends on the 1st gen trial against covid variants.

2021-04-30 08:52:02,wallstreetbets,"Here's a solution. Everyone gets the recipes. Each government pays its own people to make the vaccines. The money stays in house and everyone wins. Nobody works for free. Simple.

Don't need to build a company, Canada, the uk, the USA, etc all have pharmaceutical manufacturers who could get the right stuff needed to make the vaccines themselves. Just requires Cooperation.

I know this is not the same thing but look what happened during ww2 in the states for example and manufacturers... all the car manufacturers were mandated to switch production to aircraft or tanks or ammunition. 

Apply the same to this and get it done. That's my opinion."
2021-04-30 10:00:47,wallstreetbets,"Richest countries making progress??? You are looking at countries like Chile,Uruguay,Peru,Mexico Morocco, Turkey, Hungary, Israel, Romania, Serbia, Greece, Indonesia, Cambodia, Singapore that had no vaccines a month or two ago vaccinating at a much quicker rate that The USA, UK, France, Italy that had had vaccines since Dec/Jan.

2021-04-30 09:27:10,wallstreetbets,"Well there are lots of recipes... each manufacturer has their own. But there is no difference between a schematic for a bullet thats universal or a recipe for a vaccine. Anyone can make them if they have the plans. But because these manufacturers did the leg work they make the recipe proprietary. All that needs to happen is remove that part, and that's solely up to the manufacturers."
2021-04-30 11:06:13,wallstreetbets,"I am not saying they weren't hit hard by Covid. I'm merely focusing on vaccination rate. Colombia might not be moving as quickly as those countries stated before but they are moving at a similar pace as the USA. 6% of the population vaccinated in a month is not bad at all. 

Africa I already explained with a comparison to polio. While most of the world eradicated polio in 1990. Most African countries started to erradicated in 2010 onwards. With the last case in africa occurred last August. So can you really count them in to purchase any vaccine??"

The Rand/dollar exchange rate has actually generally performed well over time. In 1995 the average rate was R3.63 to the USD. At R14.50 now in 2021 - if it stays around here - that works out to a devaluation in nominal terms of +- 5.2% per annum which is probably not that exciting to a currency speculator. 

Of course that doesn‚Äôt mean that shorter term currency speculation won‚Äôt make/lose money and that the current state of affairs in SA isn‚Äôt perhaps trending the right way but betting against SA in 1994 wouldn‚Äôt have been an amazing bet and a lot can still go right/wrong in the next 20 years!"

Also the Starlink thing is just straight up false. You are referring to draft legislation that is still open for comment and unlikely to pass in it's current form. 

Besides, I don't think it is unreasonable for a country that is 92% non-white, to mandate ownership reflect at least a bit of that demographic. It is also not clear that this would apply to infrastructure providers and data providers the same, never mind how this will apply to international firms

That drafted law already exists in building infrastructure and many other sectors, where contracts are given to Black Economic Empowerment companies. It doesn‚Äôt help the labourers, it helps the multimillionaire owners. And by helping a ‚Äòbit‚Äô of the demographic, it‚Äôs helping an absolute minority of the population, who have nothing in common with labourers other than skin colour. The land grab is fucked up and compromises national food security. Food prices have skyrocketed, again, effecting the lowest common denominator. The racial laws the government have passed have not helped who they promise to help, but creates a new class of oligarchs."
2021-04-30 13:19:00,wallstreetbets,"I think you should have a deeper look at the situation. Black empowerment is awesome when it empowers the poor and lifts the economy. Unfortunately, the BEE laws are very exploitable and generally they only serve to further empower the rich. Many of the legislative standards in South Africa seem like they should really be making a difference. But then why aren't things changing? Because politicians are selfish and rich people will always find ways to exploit the system. Very few people are really gaining from the systems ZA has in place. 

I can tell that you feel like accusing anyone who disagrees with you of racism, so please don't bother responding because I am not even trying to get a response from you.

You just don‚Äôt like affirmative action and prefer the oligarchs to be white.

Name me one law that doesn‚Äôt apply to both black and white.

I can show you very many laws explicitly created to hurt the poor (majority black citizens) while keeping the economically advantaged in their cosy positions 

Fact is, nothing you suggest has been passed. You are pretending draft legislation, is actually legislation, which is like the Reps screaming about Biden coming for their burgers

The workers aren‚Äôt getting the capital off course, but what they are getting is an opportunity to actually compete in the job market. Even with BBBEE companies still go out of their way to hire along race lines. Legislation that stops this, levels the playing field

While were screeching about things that haven‚Äôt been implemented 

South Africa proposed eminent domain and that upset capital. They would rather have our cities littered with abandon buildings

If it had anything to do with food security, capital would be screaming for farming subsidies. But they don‚Äôt cause they already own the majority of farmland and don‚Äôt want to lose their effective monopoly"

Instead of corrupt government contracts wasting billions by giving their buddies millions who are living in waterfront penthouses, how about we pipe that money into education, transport and infrastructure?"

Only the naive see corruption as anything but a tool of the powerful to maintain their hold on power.

Fact is that billions you are talking about goes into the pockets of black and white oligarchs and has little to do with capital transfer to the poor

At least what BBBEE actually does, is force employers to not just hire white people. Hiring is still heavily along racial lines (preferring whites and native Afrikaners/English) even when a suitably qualified person of colour is available"

All of their loans are sold off to investors such as Fannie Mae (FNMA). Retaining servicing for a small monthly profit adds risks in exchange for predictable cash flow. If rates go higher, Refi activity will decline and cut into those front end profits , however the Servicing will stick around longer and thus become more valuable. Both UWMC and RKT have cut their margins on origination during this ultimatum show down which is great for me as a Broker but might show up in declining profits for both companies in another couple quarters.

They just did (UWM) Welcome to mortgage market!  It is RUN by incredible smart people, they are still people, but they know how to expand market with raising rates too.

But Just went Clemson South Caroline, lovely community with NO for Sale signs, nobody know what property is really worth because nobody is selling, down there you buy the land and then finance the construction of the house."
2021-04-30 15:08:24,wallstreetbets,Exactly. In general the effects tend to offset each other. It‚Äôs not the total disaster many people think. People still need to buy/sell houses. The biggest problems are for people who are over-leveraged if they suddenly need to sell.

My investment in them is based solely on my working experience with them. Superior software, service, no retail side, and strong pricing. It‚Äôs a no brainer really.

I believe this pretty much whole-heartedly. Just wouldn‚Äôt happen. Also, even if it did happen to be true, it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs any loyalty in mortgages. UWM fucks up a major deal, the brokers are gone. Their pricing gets a little worse, the brokers are gone. My shop does about $200 million a month in broker loans, about 50/50 to UWM/QL before the ultimatum and we chose QL. Why would we, or any broker for that matter, limit their options to one broker? And on a very, very, qualitative reasoning, QL‚Äôs site has been absolute shit. Like complete and total dogshit, and my gut tells me that their traffic has increased exponentially since, because it wasn‚Äôt like that before. I do all of our loans‚Äô operations on their site, so I spend all day on QL‚Äôs site.

We are Their customer.  Full Disclosure I am in at 8-10 and will get up 1000-3000 shares and hold to 30- 40 and then wait to see what happens with interest rates.  BTW Low rates HELP US!"
2021-04-29 23:35:22,wallstreetbets,"Right off the bat, that's wrong. Of the 12,000-12,500 Broker's that work with UWMC, only roughly 4600 also worked with Rocket and/or Fairway. Like. Right there. That means that roughly 7,900-8,400 aren't even making a choice, because they don't work with them anyway. Of the 4,600 who had to choose between the two 3,000 accepted. 400 denied. 1200 have not responded. So. Let's say of the 1200, every single one of them declined (Highly doubtful). That leaves UWMC with 10,900 to 11,400 brokers as they lost 1600. Again, I highly doubt all 1200 who didn't respond, refused. Detroit News if you want to get the news source.

While I can agree that there are brokerages that didn't respond by the deadline, and UWMC may be fudging there, I don't think all 1200 people declined.

As for Rocket doing better, well no shit. The business that UWMC is willingly letting go is going partially to Rocket. But here's the thing. While Rocket has 11 percent of the refinance market, they only have 3 percent of the purchase market. UWMC is capping their ceiling, at the cost of raising the floor a bit early. But let's not act like it's not a conflict of interest to be both in retail and wholesale. Rocket wants to drive consumers to take other loans with them like auto and personal loans, and so there'll always be that friction. And i don't blame them for wanting it.

Edit: I just remembered something. You do realize you're being facetious and I'm questioning you slightly because you're claiming that their limiting you to only UWMC when there are 73-75 other Mortgage Originators not named Fairway or Rocket."

All Brokers I talked to said well it is no brainer, you HAVE to UWM because of the speed, the fact that they improved rates dramatically, will lead to Blow By earnings expectations.

2021-04-30 08:41:04,wallstreetbets,"I'm a major cheapskate and pretty much only buy groceries.  But I mean I pretty much won't by anything clicking though the Facebook ad, you're right it is pretty much impossible to avoid all the companies on there.

A lot of times they're just serving ads for something I already bought though."
2021-04-29 22:47:33,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a wash. IG will do good but FB revenue will drop.
2021-04-30 08:51:30,wallstreetbets,"Where do you shop? If you shop at any of the major grocery stores, I have some sad news for you buddy, they advertise on Facebook.

Also you understand first off clicks happen about 1% of the time, and conversions from those are also highly unlikely, right? 

You clearly don't understand how advertising works, nor does op, and the attitude Reddit has for privacy is massively distorted to the real world."
2021-04-30 09:14:04,wallstreetbets,"This is about hurting facebook, not privacy.  You're kind of illustrating the point that advertising on facebook is worthless and advertisers should pull all their money from it."
2021-04-30 09:29:48,wallstreetbets,"The guy keeps talking about privacy and algos putting you into a specific target group. This whole post is about privacy and data farming if you haven't read it.

Why should they pull money from Facebook? How much do you think a click is costs? How much do you think it's worth? Why do all b2c businesses with a significant budget advertise online? Why is it companies that spend more on advertising outperform companies that don't? Why are most major companies trending towards over 50% of budget on digital spend? And why do small and medium size companies start off with digital spend on Google and Facebook?"
2021-04-30 17:36:28,wallstreetbets,"I think people will realize the danger in an oligopoly having all of their information...

It‚Äôs not about the farming itself, but the consolidation of that information and only a few eyes on it. And we can‚Äôt know what they might use it for because there‚Äôs no transparency"

2021-04-29 20:06:11,wallstreetbets,Thanks! I hope to be on target next time. What mistakes in my forecast stand out to you?
2021-04-29 22:42:19,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt see enough data to truly give thorough response but here are my thoughts below. 

I‚Äôd recommend starting with the balance sheet in common size form. 

Next, analyze the growth rate for each segment and changes relative to changes in deliveries and operating margin. Make 3-6 cases for deliveries which leads to total revenue. Next 3-6 cases of operating margin. 

Then I‚Äôd build my brackets for each item you listed based on those parameters. 

Lots of other factors going on here with such a high growth entity looking to expand into different countries and could have fx issues."
2021-04-30 07:45:34,wallstreetbets,I read that the guidance call is 9am but financials released yesterday. Is this correct? Just surprised how flat this is... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2021-04-29 22:25:29,wallstreetbets,Wow this really blew up after hours!
2021-04-29 21:07:05,wallstreetbets,Can ya break it down there? I cant read.
2021-04-30 09:00:47,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs no liquidity in small caps like GNW after hours / before hours.  They crushed earnings by all metrics.  The market will weigh it higher. Annualized earnings and apply a 5 to 10 PE (you choose) and you see a stock value much higher.
2021-04-30 01:27:39,wallstreetbets,"Because if the mortgage branches into its own business, with a separate ticker, than that is profit GNW will no longer recognize.  (but is now?)"
2021-04-29 22:01:02,wallstreetbets,"i dont know too much about these things, still pretty new, but ""Q1 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.33 beats by $0.10; GAAP EPS of $0.34 beats by $0.19.""  that seems like really good news

edit: spelling"
2021-04-30 09:02:15,wallstreetbets,Are you listening to guidance call right now?
2021-04-30 06:06:45,wallstreetbets,"No. GNW is a holding company and they currently own 100% of US mortgage insurance (USMI).  The USMI IPO will float between 10-19.99% of GNW‚Äôs stake. USMI will then issue dividends at GNW‚Äôs direction to shareholders, so GNW and public shareholders of USMI will receive cash dividends."
2021-04-30 09:27:59,wallstreetbets,I am.  It's very good.  They are very well capitalized.  Hitting hitting on all cylinders.  An investor presentation for today's call is at: [https://genworth2014.q4web.com/investors/events-and-presentations/presentations/default.aspx](https://genworth2014.q4web.com/investors/events-and-presentations/presentations/default.aspx)
2021-04-30 07:41:33,wallstreetbets,Same.
2021-04-30 12:16:27,wallstreetbets,"So instead of realizing all of USMI's profits, they will now only recognize the dividend income which will be a fraction of net.  Still not seeing exactly how that is a positive, especially if they plan on holding onto ~90% of the company anyway.

Sounds to me that they want to split the businesses for liability purposes.  (E.g. if mortgages tank again, this doesn't bring down their whole company)"
2021-04-30 12:53:57,wallstreetbets,"GNW will still control USMI. USMI‚Äôs earnings will still consolidate at GNW, and that‚Äôs why they are only spinning off between 10-19.99% of USMI, not the entire stake. (19.99% is the most they can do tax free and still consolidate.)

USMI dividending cash up to the holding company to service debt is a function of earnings. The rest is retained earnings."
2021-04-30 12:56:03,wallstreetbets,"USMI is a cash cow ‚Äî not a fragile liability. The question holding GNW back has been LTC in the Life business, but they are getting rate increases and (per management) they do not intend to add any capital to the Life business."
2021-04-29 21:04:57,wallstreetbets,Got 18 7/16 85c myself. Glad I got other people to lose money with!
2021-04-29 21:22:00,wallstreetbets,Yeah amd got me good this week. I know better than to call things on earnings.........so I did puts on exxon this week üòé hope I dint get the double whammy lol
2021-04-29 22:31:21,wallstreetbets,"which is weird, if the stock doesn't pay dividends anyway, and you know the price is going to go down because other people are doing that too"
2021-04-30 00:44:19,wallstreetbets,So you‚Äôre saying buy low and sell high? I can‚Äôt believe nobody has thought of this.
2021-04-30 00:51:42,wallstreetbets,"I know revolutionary stuff, right. No surprise I am being eviscerated here for saying it here either. This place is where misbegotten dreams go to die. Fun place to be though if you are fine with making it to a high mountain top where you can comfortably watch fools fall while trying to reach the moon."
2021-04-30 00:13:45,wallstreetbets,"So am I. But I'm not a dick lol.

2021-04-30 00:30:59,wallstreetbets,"Not at all, sold the morning after at $87 made a nice profit. Nice try though. Will probably buy into it again on the dip at some point."
2021-04-30 00:23:46,wallstreetbets,Good lord that's a bad attitude.

2021-04-30 00:41:41,wallstreetbets,"Nah, people guzzling man juice over sitting in a stock when the majority of the gains you are going to make percentage wise have been realized have terrible attitudes when it comes to trading."

Do we have any views on this matter?

2021-04-29 22:32:14,wallstreetbets,"I got you fam. For starters, a profit loss graph always helps me visualize:

Here's the $15 strike
http://opcalc.com/u12

Here's the $35 strike
http://opcalc.com/u14

To answer you question on the different strikes. Yes, they are pretty similar. They are both pretty far ITM or in-the-money. So the premiums are mostly intrinsic value, but the lower strike premium will always be less because it has less extrinsic value. You can see the difference in premiums moreso the further out you go on expiry. Extrinsic value fades as you get closer to expiry because the potential to increase or decrease goes to zero when there's no time left to do so.

Things get more interesting when you buy ATM (at the money) or OTM (out of the money). The premiums for those options have little or zero intrinsic value because what good does exercising a strike above current stock do for you? They have extrinsic value because the stock *could* rise. Plby options look relatively expensive to me because the stock has gone up a lot recently. Their extrinsic value is high. Nobody wants to sell an OTM call for cheap if this thing might go straight to $90 and you have to pay the strike. Those calls get more expensive as you go further out in expiry because the stock has more time to moon. It's a bigger risk for the seller so they want a higher insurance premium in case their sold call gets exercised on a stock mooning.

2021-04-29 20:37:59,wallstreetbets,">He learned not to be scared of a tiny frog

He looked pretty scared at the end of the video. Is there a follow-up video of him casually playing with a frog like it's no big deal or something? 

If so, that's great! It doesn't necessarily indicate that his trust in parents came out unscathed, but it would also be great if did. Kids have a lot of experiences, and they don't necessarily take all of them with them into adulthood. That said,

>you're speaking in hyperbole and misrepresenting what happened.

I absolutely am not. 

The video starts with him screaming and his mother laughing. She then approaches him, asking why he poked the frog. He's holding out his arm with the frog on it and she reaches for it. I imagine most viewers (and her child) are assuming that she's moving to pull it off his arm at this point. 

Then the video goes into slow motion, zooms in, pauses, and then she moves her finger side-to-side, knocking the frog onto her child's face, which causes him to scream louder. The camera focuses on his face for second, and the video ends with her laughing, and him still screaming. 

I'm assuming the pauses, Will Ferrell's face, and the narrator going, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, we've got him"" were added in after the fact by whoever added the WSB-related content. 

But even then, my summary was accurate. He was scared, signaled to his mother for help, she acted like she was going to help, only to intentionally escalate the situation, which caused him more fear and her more laughter. End video. 

>The child's not hurt, 

Just because he's not physically injured doesn't mean that he's not hurt; he's clearly hurting. 

>and he shouldn't need to signal for his mother for every trivial interaction he has that upsets him.

Are you being serious? His swing is still part booster-seat.  

>Coddling your child does them no good.

Agreed. But neither does going out of your way to make them feel worse for your own amusement. 

The adult in the video crossed a line when she intentionally flicked the frog into the kid's face. That's the point where she teaches him that she can't be trusted to protect him because she either can't see his fear or because she cares less about it than her own amusement. Even if that wasn't her intention, that's still the lesson being taught in that moment, *because that's what happened*. 

Laughing a little bit, going over to your child, taking the frog off of his body, and letting him know that you saw how scared he was but that he's okay now while still laughing is *not* coddling. That's how you cultivate trust while teaching the kid to not be afraid of things."

2021-04-30 15:35:11,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôll take a while to explain everything, but I‚Äôll give you a starting point.

PMCC is a poor mans covered call.

To understand this, you will need to know how a covered call works, and how vertical, calendar, and diagonal spreads work.

Next, you‚Äôll want to know how theta, gamma, delta, and Vega work (look up options greeks) as well as implied volatility. This is the fundamentals for how an option will be priced and how it‚Äôs price will change over time and react to a change in price of the underlying (the stock that the option is based on).

Now, ITM, ATM, and OTM just mean In The Money, At The Money, and Out The Money respectively.

For example, if you buy a $10 call for Ford and the share price is $15, your option is in the money. If you buy a $15 call when the share price is $15, your option is at the money. And if you buy a $20 call when the share is $15, your option is OTM.

From here, you‚Äôll find how options are priced differently, and based on whether the stock is ITM, ATM, and OTM, how delta and theta are affected and what the intrinsic value of the option is. TL;DR: if it is ITM, it has a higher delta and intrinsic value. ATM = lower delta and 0 intrinsic value. OTM = even lower delta and 0 intrinsic value.

Now this all sounds very complicated but you should be to understand it if you watch 3-4 videos. I‚Äôll link some below

I forgot to mention that a LEAP is just a long dated option. Since it‚Äôs may 2021, a call dated for July 2021 would not be a leap. It should be about 300 days+ out, so like January 2023 would be a great leap, but April 2022 would also be considered one. LEAPs have a lower theta which means they decay slower

I wasn't coddled as a kid, and my mother and I laughed TOGETHER. Not her laughing while i was crying.

Being rude isn't an argument.

>I'll summarize by saying the child was overreacting and screaming like a maniac over nothing.

Just because we know it was nothing doesn't mean that he kid knew it was nothing. He's a child.

First, you tried to claim that nothing happened, and that I had ""misrepresented the situation"" and when that failed, you tried to claim that what happened wasn't a big deal, and the kid ""overreacted.""

2021-04-29 21:17:01,wallstreetbets,The option LEAPS are still super cheap with lots of upside.
2021-04-29 21:19:46,wallstreetbets,Godammit I‚Äôm bagholding again. But I love it. My 1500$ portfolio is up 40% because of you guys. Let‚Äôs go. Sold all WSB DD for at least 15% gain since February.

2021-04-30 08:50:03,wallstreetbets,">Back

I don't think soon. It's a buy and hold. It will get there, but better to get investors willing to hold then someone who may get frustrated and feed the bears."
2021-04-30 09:13:08,wallstreetbets,"Not suspect at all. The appreciation happened in Europe over night. Right now it is back at $4.80, 19 million shares traded on the exchange. Days range was from $4.70 to $4.87. What is suspect is the huge dump of shares when market opened in the U.S.  Anyone can watch it trade in Europe here: [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nokia?countrycode=fi&mod=mw\_quote\_tab](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nokia?countrycode=fi&mod=mw_quote_tab)"

2021-04-29 20:27:54,wallstreetbets,Yeah that‚Äôs exactly my point.. as soon as 5G gets rolled out 6G will start to get all the investments that 5G got while it was the hot new thing. Same thing happened with 3 & 4G.. don‚Äôt know why it will be any different this time. Also $nok has over 5 billion shares outstanding it will take a fuck ton of buying to move the needle
2021-04-30 02:56:13,wallstreetbets,"No one is saying Nokia can only provide 5g equipments/software. Ericsson,Cisco, Huawei are the big players of this same 5g market. Samsung R&D is a new entry so they might not have much patents as of now. There are small players like Mavenir, Affirmed networks(recently acquired by Microsoft) etc.What the post said is "" Nokia is the only company with an end-to-end 5G platform "". End to end 5g requires to have different layers of the 5g ecosystem.

First comes the base station or antennas, then there is packet core which controls and manages millions of UEs(phone). The packet core consists of different nodes, one handles the session and mobility of the UE. Another handles the charging, some handles the actual data packets to/from your phones. and many more. thirdly there comes the actual network of optical fibre and routers.

Unlike Nokia Not all company have product line in all those segments. Creating a single product after years of R&D is not a easy thing. If someone starts now, they will finish by the time 6g has come. Nokia was investing in 5g R&D for last 5-6 years maybe. New players can not just pop up with all the nodes 5g requires.

Disclaimer: I work for Nokia R&D. The information i gave are pretty generic publicly available info, not any company secret.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)  


  
Personal opinion on why Nokia is stuck at $4 is of their past record with Mobile phones business and bad quarterly results due to the merge with Alcatel lucent few years back which put a pressure in the finance report.  


Also IMO generally people dont realize the Nokia phone they see are not from the same company. people still associate Nokia with the sales of HMD global's Nokia phone. If people understands that there are much more than phones in 4g/5g then the situation might be different."
2021-04-29 23:50:23,wallstreetbets,nokia is leading EU's commission into 6G research as well

2021-04-29 20:14:35,wallstreetbets,"So here is the deal with Canadian MJ stocks/companies. Everyone can do DD on all sorts of companies but they are leaving out one major factor....time in market. Canada is ahead of US by years as far as legalization/tax/sales, etc. While US companies are now jumping in -- they have to learn to swim in the beginning. Who is to say US MJ stocks wont prevail in the end but for now Canada has the 1-up on the North American portion of the industry. So for now, Canada based MJ is a good investment---when US fully legalizes it, then US companies may surpass Canadian
Case in point...canadian company has developed THC breathalizer...not US...but guess where is is being shipped to for use....the USA. In the future, a US company may develop their own (but they will essentially be starting from scratch working on the backs of others)... but ultimately the current situation is that Canada has the upper hand in the MJ industry."

Sweetwater Brewing (acquisition) and Manitoba Harvest (acquisition).

&#x200B;

Aphria's CEO seems bullish on scooping up more US MSOs in a similar approach that looks to be working for Canopy."
2021-04-29 20:46:50,wallstreetbets,"A. Sweetwater is at the very least in GA and FL, and likely....across the entire country.

B. Look into Privateer Holdings......perhaps you'll uncover some things."
2021-04-29 20:58:13,wallstreetbets,"1. Tilray already has licensing in the US.

2. Look into Privateer Holdings. They're private, so it might be difficult to find details on them, but their founder is the CEO of Tilray. For example, they own Leafly. There are many more things there that aren't being considered by a lot of people.

IMO, this isn't going to be won in the long haul by the MSO with the most dispensaries in the most states right now.

IMO that is very short sighted and doesn't take into consideration that the playing field changes. 

Tilray has the broadest hammer, even Cannabis publications, like Leafly as a small example.

Dispensaries might not be the future, and if they are, it wouldn't be very difficult for Tilray to partner with, merge, or buy licenses or failed companies that have licenses in the states they want to target.

People seem to forget that Brendan Kennedy went to Yale, was born in San Francisco, and if the US legalized 1st, Tilray would be in the US.

The only reason Tilray is a ""Canadian"" company, is because Canada legalized 1st, so Brendan made the logical choice as a Cannbis investor to start a company there.

P.S. He lives in Seattle. Tilray isn't some foreign giant coming after American companies....it is the result of an ambitious American making the best choices for success based on poor American policies."
2021-04-30 15:03:39,wallstreetbets,"Do you honestly think every state is going to have their own unique brands. Come on man. That's like saying Bud Light will only be available in select states. You need to get over the MSO model. No offense, it's just not going to be the future. Maybe it will be for another few years, but long term it 100% won't be.

You really think the government is going to decriminalize and the states are going to continue on as if nothing happened. That's delusional friend."
2021-04-30 09:41:29,wallstreetbets,"Sure, they're ""the best suited Canadian LP,"" but that's a pretty narrow classification, don't you think? My issues with an acquisition approach are that you will likely overpay, current major MSOs are approaching billion-dollar revenue numbers so why do they want you, and you absorb all of the problems of MSOs now, which there are plenty. Aphria's CEO is always bullish, but he's kind of a clown, honestly. He makes me cringe every time he's on CNBC"
2021-04-29 20:58:50,wallstreetbets,"Sweetwater beverages are in most states, yes, but they don't actually have any THC or CBD beverages in any markets, yet, so that acquisition is currently only as valuable as Sweetwater previously was, but federal legalization and cross-state standardization (which are years away, at minimum, btw) will definitely be positive catalysts. Currently, however, THC beverages in many states are either disallowed, or regulated to extremely low TAC levels. They are also pretty difficult to manufacture properly at higher TAC levels, given current tech and expertise. And, finally, but definitely not to be sneezed at: it is quite likely that regulatory authorities will continue to only allow THC/CBD products to be sold at licensed cannabis dispensaries (certainly you won't be able to hold cannabis and liquor retail licenses on the same premises, let alone combine them in the same product(s)), which will continue to give an edge to the vertically-integrated MSOs who own dispensary and production licenses already - at least for a time. People who point to MSOs ""relying on the strict regulatory environments to make all their money in states"" are fooling themselves if they think federal, interstate regulation is going to be any less structured.

Edit: Privateer rings a bell but I can't place it, I'll do some reading before bed

Edit again: I should note that CBD products are currently mostly unregulated, sorry, it's late"

2021-04-29 21:16:57,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm really unsure of what you‚Äôre talking about in terms of licensing. Tilray nor Privateer holdings have any US state growing licenses. You‚Äôre leading me in the direction of a ceo that heads a Canadian mj company, founded a private equity company that specializes in brand management, and leafly which is a database. None of this give you access to the American market. You‚Äôre best hope is that they scoop up failed licensed mso‚Äôs then good luck. Those too will be bought out by bigger US names well before Tilray has the chance."
2021-04-30 15:13:02,wallstreetbets,"You really don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm saying at all. I‚Äôm saying each state is going to pick its own winner and most already have. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre not from the states and don‚Äôt understand our structure. Maybe do some research on what decriminalization actually does. Just because the fed legalized, it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs legal in every state. There are still state laws and regulation that stand in the way. Especially in the states that have not yet legalized med and or Rec. it can be said with certainty that yes each state is going to handle it differently, because that‚Äôs how the United ‚Äústates‚Äù of America works. The federal government is simply going to kick the responsibility of regulation and taxation down to the state lvl and let them decide (states rights are a thing). 

>	Bud Light will only be available in select states. 

Look up what dry counties are. The sale Bud light is illegal in those in the US. 

The MSO model is profitable lmao where the LP isn‚Äôt in a legal country. Do you know how silly what you‚Äôre saying is? 

It really seems like this sector isn‚Äôt for you maybe look somewhere else."
2021-04-30 12:41:07,wallstreetbets,"You make some great points. I assume there are less barriers to entry in a state if you acquire a company already registered and conducting business there. For example, I believe in Florida you need to have history of growing other commercial crops for X years before you can obtain a commercial growing license for cannabis. (The lobbyists at work obviously). Overpay? Likely but the premium also could relieve some of the headaches of establishing new companies in the state. Who knows? I bought a diversified batch of of pot stocks in March 2020 so I'm in it for the long, with most having agreements or acquisitions. I am really hoping for ACB to find a US partner because my position would skyrocket. Thats the last of the true Canada only major players that haven't made its way into the US I believe."
2021-04-29 21:20:25,wallstreetbets,"I agree 100% that the regulation will be heavy, much like alcohol is regulated differently by county in some states.

However, my point was that if that is to be considered an eventuality, that Tilray already has the proper connections/channels of distribution to get whatever their product might be to its end destination in the US.

I agree beer and THC/CBD combined in a bottle for sale at Shell is unlikely, FDA would have a field day with that concept, but who knows, maybe one day.

However, we're talking about having a footprint and having proper channels of distribution in place to move product.

Whether that be in Sweatwater beer, candies, Cookies, or packaged as cigarettes, once the connection has been made with a buyer, like the existing ones buying Sweetwater, then to add another product would not be as massive of a compilation as some might be implying.

It doesn't seem impractical that you would be able to pickup a Cannabis product at a gas station one day. After all, Tobacco and Alcohol are sold in the same premises, in some states they even sell guns on the same premise.

P.S. Thank God, some rational discussion for once on this board with someone that has a mind lol.

P.P.S. From the sounds of it, you've done your DD, but either way, look into Privateer Holdings, not a lot of info out there on them, but certainly important to consider.üëç"

2021-04-29 22:56:14,wallstreetbets,"""I‚Äôm really unsure of what you‚Äôre talking about in terms of licensing."" - There are some details on this in prior WSB subs.

Who says that they have to grow it instate in order to make a profit? Think licensing and branding. Also, I don't think it would be outlandish to think that they get some licenses at some time in the future.

Also, if it's legalized, do you think all states will have a policy like this going forward? Companies might be able to get it cheaper buying it and it might be more economical. I'm sure the US will import Cannabis at some point. They already have from Tilray for testing.

What US companies are going to get these additional licenses? That doesn't make sense, they would already have them. The US companies will consolidate as time progresses, just like the Canadian companies are doing now. That will leave room for other companies to enter the market, like Tilray, who will be able to produce the product at the same or better quality for less with a broad market and product base."
2021-04-30 13:00:22,wallstreetbets,"Not for nothing, but ACB is the king god emperor of overpaying for acquisitions. There are already graduate finance classes taught about the ""goodwill"" on their balance sheet, and how to avoid it at all costs."
2021-04-30 09:29:56,wallstreetbets,"If your investment thesis relies in any way on alcohol and THC products being sold on the same premises, you're just gambling. Sure, it might happen one day, but you're just going to be losing money or stagnating (which counts as losing) until then. 

To be completely honest, my only current cannabis positions are in KSHB/GNLN, and I'm not in love with that, either. I think MSOs are due for a massive reckoning from their business practices and I don't think LPs have the market reach necessary under what I see as likely future conditions of regulation. I'm really more likely to invest privately in the sector for the near future, looking for small batch growers in emerging markets."

2021-04-29 20:44:17,wallstreetbets,"Everyone has their philosophy. I am buying shares and options because I get more buying power like that. Buying shares increases the price, buying options increases my leverage.

I see Canoo as a long term buy so I plan on buying calls that will go far out (2023, 2024), very deep ITM. If the price goes down I am still ITM and I have alternatives, buying more shares or calls. If the price goes up I make more money. If I can sell, the options at a good price at a later date great, if I can‚Äôt, they are deep enough ITM that I would just exercise at expiration.

I do agree this is a slow play though..."

While I do agree that electric vehicles and cleaner energy is the way of the future, there is going to be quite some time before that takes ahold. Summer is about to hit along with COVID restrictions lifting, planes, cruise ships, majority of the world runs off of carbon. Electric is emerging, and is fast climbing because it is new and solidifying, but the fossil fuel trade is what this person refers to as a giant and that‚Äôs true and will be for at least 50 more years. GMC made the promise that by 2035 they would be all electric, and that‚Äôs 15 years away (I would assume most vehicle manufactures will follow suite) so that leaves a brand new 2034 model running on gas.... still.

GME is painting a bull flag on the hourly just like it always does after a breakout from periods of consolidation.

I'm thinking 200 to 250 for EOW next week depending on how Monday goes, but these 180's are definitely gonna expire worthless.

2021-04-29 23:02:57,wallstreetbets,"Hey, potential play there, maybe with $TSLA puts in the future for when Elon starts liquidating his Tesla stock holdings to fund that first crewed Mars mission.  The question is when would that happen?

Here are some possibilities:

1) When Starship finally reaches orbit, then manages to stick the landing without exploding 8 minutes later like the SN10 Starship prototype.  Or...

2) When two Starships demonstrate on-orbit propellant transfer.  This needs to work in order to pull off a Mars mission--  A Starship needs to be refueled at least 6-7 times in low earth orbit to get to Mars.  Or...

3) When SpaceX launches the first unmanned test flight to Mars.  The Mars transfer windows due to orbital mechanics are:  September 2022, October/November 2024, November/December 2026, and December 2028/January 2029.

Maybe buying Tesla puts for some of those dates when a Starship Mars flight is possible might be a play, if Elon will sell some Tesla stock to fund the Mars missions.  :-)"
2021-04-30 06:24:20,wallstreetbets,"then why do people trade options? If you are >50% in predicting the market you should come out with more wins overall, right? Best case you win lots of $$$, worst case you lose a premium?"
2021-04-30 08:31:11,wallstreetbets,"Why do people buy lottery tickets? Exactly. They hope to win a lot of money very fast. 

And actually I was wrong before when I said puts are the only way to bet on a stock going down without you losing more than what you put in. You can also buy turbo's. This is not popular in NA but very popular in Europe and Hong Kong I believe. Look up the difference between turbo's and options and decide which one you like the most."

2021-04-30 16:40:57,wallstreetbets,"All jokes aside... you can do this? 

So you'd be selling the call without actually owning the underlying shares (or retaining enough buying power to purchase 100 shares at strike if exercised), correct? Does buying the ITM call at the same time make this different or somehow less risky than just straight up writing a naked call? Do they essentially cancel each other out in some way, or partially, depending on the result of the spread?

Sorry if this is something very basic that I'm missing; brain still needs to be filled with a lot of shit."

2021-04-30 19:11:43,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the point of buying the itm call is that if the short call is assigned you can exercise the long one.  This is called a debit spread.

2021-04-29 20:15:41,wallstreetbets,Pretty much. There was no reason for TSLA to fall. There was no rally up to earnings like the $50 rally in after-hours when they beat delivery numbers and the stock has been trading between 730-750+ for at least a week. The only excuse is that TSLA always drops after earnings or that $700+ it's still overvalued.

2021-04-30 09:52:47,wallstreetbets,Bought the ROOT stock last time they tried to pump it still bag holding. Not as sexy for short term. However there are some valid points and this type of insurance model pay per usage is growing. Longer term as the company grows it‚Äôll profit nicely. For the swing traders it can still be an attractive short to moderate term hold.
2021-04-30 13:38:37,wallstreetbets,"I have no thoughts on their stats, but I tried them out last year, and based on that experience decided not to go with them and probably would not invest with them.

I found their app and process to be not very easy to use and annoying, and didn't find it seemed to differentiate whether I was driving or a passenger as claimed.

It did offer to insure me.  But as a long time safe driver that's had the same provider for many years, the savings was not good enough to make me switch.  I was hoping for a significant savings, like 40%+ or something considering I drive relatively little since I work from home, and I drive safely.  

The savings was more like 15%.  And beyond that, if you read user reviews, there were overwhelming numbers of users who complained of the rates being jacked up considerably after the first term.  That seems pretty likely, that you get offered a teaser rate, but I wasn't here for that.  Starting with only a minor savings, any increase at all after one year would make it a waste of time to leave a real insurer that I've got an established relationship with.

I like the premise, but was not impressed with it in my own situation.  I think this is the future, I'm not convinced that Root will be it."
2021-04-30 13:51:30,wallstreetbets,"I'm in for 1k shares. Earnings next Wednesday hoping for a quick flip. Long term they are probably good, over $1b in cash and hardly any debt. 

Wouldn't be the first time a tech company has blown a lot of cash though."
2021-04-29 23:59:15,wallstreetbets,"Not really -- as he mentioned, these IPO lawsuits happen to most IPOs, so it's in the same position as most other IPOs would be (and currently *are*). Also, most stocks will be in trouble if inflation shoots up, this stock isn't unique in that. Third, regarding moat, most companies have competitors, so it's not unique to ROOT, but OP even says that it's just a hypothetical anyway. 

The only bear case that could actually be a unique issue to ROOT is the last one about the rate of complaints, which is something to look into, but OP had a decent explanation for why they get so many complaints (rising rates for worse driving), so that doesn't seem to be a huge deal either -- at least, not something that will negatively affect the stock price in any meaningful way.

IMO, I'd consider those bear cases as non-issues -- or at least, they're the same issues that almost all stocks share, so they're not somehow worse for ROOT than they would be for any other stock."
2021-04-30 14:28:49,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense given your experience. I had the complete opposite one. I really like the app. During my trial period they were perfectly able to differentiate between me as a driver and as a passenger. The savings weren't ridiculous for me, but I had a big discount with my old insurer because of where I work. I haven't gotten to the renewal phase yet, but I do know a few others who use Root, and the only person to get a rate increase come renewal time was a friend of mine who ""cheated"" during the trial period and drove much better than he usually does. I figure that the people complaining of rate increases are those that were on better-than-usual behavior during the trial and Root adjusts accordingly afterwards. Another guy I know actually got a substantial rate decrease after his first sixth months and it's stayed low. Time will tell for my rate and the company as a whole, but I totally understand you not investing given your experience."
2021-04-30 07:05:26,wallstreetbets,"In, with 6,800 shares... this is the way"
2021-04-29 23:13:39,wallstreetbets,"No need for sources, that makes perfect sense but that does mean, assuming this change continues, that their revenue going forward is about 250 million, maybe 300 after 2 more quarters; so their PSG will probably drop from 6.84 to somewhere around 9-12 in the next 6 months (which sounds about right, even with their high growth rate), and suddenly they aren't that great of a deal - at least not today."
2021-04-30 15:05:45,wallstreetbets,"That's very promising. I went to working remote coincidentally right before Covid hit. I was waiting for that to try Root. I wonder if a whole bunch of other people who found themselves suddenly remote tried to jump in too and made things wonky for a few months.

And since I've got 20+ years of safe driving with my current company I've got pretty good rates probably, without having to ""prove"" it. Someone without that history, that seems to be the sweet spot where Root could use your driving to give you rates a standard company wouldn't.

I'll continue to watch, I'd like to see their retention over multiple terms."
2021-04-29 23:18:01,wallstreetbets,They're tabling reinsurance so their revs will have as much YoY growth as before.
2021-04-30 07:28:36,wallstreetbets,"I understand that but that has nothing to do with the point I just made, that the PSG will go up significantly over the next 2 quarters due to the significantly lowered revenue due to there being no reinsurance revenue coming in anymore.  Anyhow, good luck with it.  I still think its a great stock, just not today. These numbers go to 11.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOO5S4vxi0o"
2021-04-30 07:38:05,wallstreetbets,"No, reinsurance cedes about 70% of their revs in exchange for stability. Postponing their reinsurance program will increase revenue by about 70%. ROOT is forecasting YoY doubling of revenues in 2021."

2021-04-30 08:45:46,wallstreetbets,I found daytrading highly volatile options to avoid the theta decay can be surprisingly profitable but that might be a game stop exclusive thing yeah I don‚Äôt know
2021-04-30 08:51:45,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Options are enticing but it‚Äôs really difficult to win on those with any consistency and you should be glued to your computer/phone because when they pop green you have to take it. If you wait for higher returns down the line then you‚Äôre fucked. Even if it hits 3% return you take what you can get and live to fight another day. I don‚Äôt have that discipline.

So, ya, timing is important, welcome to stock investing 101.
Look back at when you bought...did you get on the bus halfway through the route?

2021-04-30 08:45:10,wallstreetbets,"I have been invested in AMD since 2007. My observation is the following, look at the options, AMD (yahoo finance, options straddle mode). You will see the following, way more call options than put options. Every Friday (with the 3rd Friday of every month being the largest one), market makers who mostly sell those options drive the price!! 

Wall Street is rigged, there are multiple levels of access to trading a d information. AMD is held 85% by institutions, the float is small. 

Market makers will drive the price down to below  82 to render about 140K contracts (14M shares) worthless. 

Small float, approx 8-10% shorted, and call options the fund managers have to provide shares for. They would loose a lot of money‚Ä¶.

So what am I saying, hold on to your shares, this will be up and down based on the money flow controlled by WS. Take a breath, and know AMD will soon shine. 

My cost basis is $3.45!"
2021-04-30 11:22:50,wallstreetbets,5 x 01/23 $60 calls loaded and ready

2021-04-29 21:59:48,wallstreetbets,They are trying to patent age old traditions and medicines and will face many lawsuits from the psychedelic community that wants to keep these drugs free for people who want and need them. The counter to Mindmed would be MAPS (https://maps.org/) a nonprofit (they attracted about $30 million in donations last year) aiming at making psychedelics legal for medical purposes.

2021-04-29 23:19:16,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.  OP did not take into account that competition is coming, and Virgin Galactic is about to lose quite a bit of their pricing power.

Up till now, Virgin Galactic is the one single company rich people can buy a ticket from to do a joyride to the edge of space, so they mosey along thinking ""we are the only game in town and we can charge what we want for a ticket on our suborbital joyride.""

But the bald supervillain who runs Amazon is about to change all that:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGw-hN8hKXw

Yes, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is about to launch a space tourist service in the same suborbital tourism market as Virgin Galactic.  And they are likely to beat Virgin Galactic to flying paid customers first, on their New Shepard rocket.  The next New Shepard flight, which is their 16th flight, will carry human passengers.

Right then and there Virgin Galactic's suborbital tourism market share gets cut in half.  Not dirt cheap anymore."
2021-04-29 22:39:35,wallstreetbets,ok so you agree with me.  My statement was that it isn't clean.
2021-04-29 22:36:12,wallstreetbets,"You state that you were being sarcastic and then after write the same nonsense after writing ""Me being serious:"" 

So which is it?  Are you serious about it being clean or are you using the word clean sarcastically? 

I say calling it clean is stupid."
2021-04-29 22:30:47,wallstreetbets,"Saying clean coal makes as much sense as saying clean nuclear.  Neither produce energy cleanly. 

 In addition,  solar is currently way cheaper than nuclear.   Nuclear costs billions to build and maintain.  It also costs millions to store the waste. The economics of the issue is proven every day as power producers choose to build new solar over nuclear."

2021-04-30 12:59:42,wallstreetbets,"Hello,

Genuine response here. Back 2006-2008 (I cant remember exactly but about that time) both shipping and potash industries were red hot darlings. POT and MS were leaders in the group and DRY (can‚Äôt remember other tickers) was a leader in shipping. It was all driven by chinas demand. It subsequently crashed. Go back to that time period and pull the charts during that range. May be valuable."

Just some bearish take to balance out the hyper-bull:

Enterprise value is good to take into consideration over just market cap.

Market cap + debt - cash = Enterprise value

25.6B + 36.4B - 3B = 59B

They had 2.4B earnings last year

59/2.4B = 24.58 Price/Enterprise value.

This isn't super cheap for a company that had 0% rev/profit growth in yoy q4 2020

If paramount+ grows a lot then they can definitely still go up, but I wouldn't say ""should be worth 2-2.5M"""

2021-04-29 21:26:42,wallstreetbets,Genuinely curious: Can you explain to me how you came to the conclusion that a co. with 500k in sales and a lofty $3.7Billion market cap is worth a buyout at $60+?
2021-04-29 21:31:43,wallstreetbets,Holding or paper hands?

2021-04-29 21:32:06,wallstreetbets,It's an issue of totally addressable market rather than current sales.  Disruptive technologies don't follow the typical valuation model.

On the earnings call, they teased at bringing back the dividend in Q2. If the upward trend continues and dividends are reinstated - I believe more institutions will buy in for their clients."

2021-04-30 18:18:58,wallstreetbets,"Happy to share some thoughts on this as well as help with the next DD. (I started some before IPO but got too busy at work last couple months. still bought in a alot at 65 and 72. )

I feel the RPA market is going to explode and the slow growth in roi in the beginning comes from a bit of the set up with IT and security teams as well as getting experience with the RPA software. While RPA has been around, there‚Äôs not been great platforms to organize and deploy your automations. 

I‚Äôm big on UiPath as the frontrunner of this market and while you could spend the time to catchup and buy your way into RPA like Microsoft, UiPath had years of trial and error to find the best way to present and manage RPA. Over the years also UiPath did a good job in marketing and attracting the biggest companies to experiment and the potential is still not capped. Even AA relatively recently revamped its platform so they are also playing a bit of catchup. If I had to rank the 3 big players in the future, 1. UiPath 2. Microsoft 3. AA"

2021-04-30 13:56:33,wallstreetbets,Are you serious? I said these guys are driving the price up by using this forum to get people like you to invest. You didn‚Äôt listen and now you‚Äôre standing these with your dick in your hand.
2021-04-30 14:13:49,wallstreetbets,"Actually, I'm not. I don't have any money in this stock, but if I did, what f'ing business is it of yours? Seriously, why t.f are you on this sub shit-talking other people's stock choices? Is your life so so miserable & boring that you have nothing else to focus on? Or are you just butt hurt because maybe you had some puts on the stock and they messed that up for you?"
2021-04-30 14:24:43,wallstreetbets,"Stfu pussy. So based on your thinking  challenging the status quo is wrong? This forum promotes the acquisition of stock based absolutely no logic, market intelligence product lifecycle changes etc. It allows those at the top to drive the demand and profit off misinformed and desperate people. I don‚Äôt count you in that group because you are clearly so well informed, which just makes you a little weak ass bitch."
2021-04-30 15:20:30,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha sounds like I struck a nerve. Funny thing is that you're here on this forum trying to influence other people's decisions regarding stocks, just as you're accusing others...only difference is that you're on the other side of the coin hoping people do not invest in the stock so you can make money, but it didn't work did it? And now you're ass out, blaming others for your shitty, flawed logic...fucking hypocrite."

2021-04-30 03:38:20,wallstreetbets,Am I understanding you correctly....Morgan Stanley only owns 10% because Microstrategy was called due on some of his total return swaps with them?  So if the B word were to drop a bit Microstrategy would have to give even more % of the company to Morgan Stanley and others?  Or give them $ he may not have in reserves?
2021-04-30 03:51:49,wallstreetbets,"Not Hwang (that was not reported anywhere to my knowledge), but very possibly just another TRS. Not sure what you mean about ‚Äúhave to give‚Äù - the contract writer buys the underlying as a hedge."
2021-04-30 04:55:13,wallstreetbets,">‚Äúhave to give‚Äù - the contract writer buys the underlying as a hedge.

Thanks for info.  What I'm trying to figure out is how is Morgan Stanley exposed to B price through Microstrategy?  If B goes down say 20% and Microstrategy drops 15% as an example, is Morgan down just that 15% on their 10% ownership?

Other question, are you saying that Morgan Stanley only owns 10% of Microstrategy because of Hwang's bad investments?  Sorry if my questions are not great."

2021-04-30 16:02:46,wallstreetbets,"Hold it a second. I realize this was a week ago but this post has been on my mind so I decided to come back and take a closer look. Posting this here for benefit of anyone who comes back to look at this in the future, sorry I didn't analyze this when the post was more current.

First of all, a bunch of these positions were still open at time of posting. Realized profits were only $4000, not $11000. Over $7000 of this was still in unclosed high-risk options.

To get that $4000 actual profit, he pulled incredibly risky moves such as selling $20000 worth of ITM puts on margin. He made $3300 of that $4000 on a single trade of 5 ITM unsecured contracts. And in just those two weeks his paper balance drew down as low as a -$2200.

Good on OP for bringing in some tendies, but this might be one of the most retarded things I've ever seen. Given that his paper worth swung between $11000 and $-2200 in two weeks and he posted this with $7k of positions still open, I'm curious what his balance is a week later.

Thanks for the entertainment, though, OP!
