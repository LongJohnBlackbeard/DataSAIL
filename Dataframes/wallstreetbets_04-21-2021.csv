2021-04-21 19:25:06,wallstreetbets,My avg is 10 so im here to stay ü•≤
2021-04-21 19:12:33,wallstreetbets,"Been watching UWMC for the past month. It's s pretty much gone sideways, is there something specific everyone is waiting for?"
2021-04-21 19:14:43,wallstreetbets,I sure hope so. Earnings and Russell inclusion coming soon.
2021-04-21 19:53:13,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a good ape.
2021-04-21 19:56:17,wallstreetbets,"It's been sideways for a year.  And the big dream is for it to get to 14 bucks for maybe a day, otherwise it will stay at 8 to 10 dollars the rest of the time, mainly 8 dollars.  
The only reason UWMC is a thing, it because of RKT.  At least RKT had it's day where it went from 20 to 40 for a few days.  And it's usually bounces around from 21 to 23, still trading sideways but higher stock and maybe higher ceiling."
2021-04-21 19:37:30,wallstreetbets,I thought I was early to the party at $9.94.......hopefully I was just REAL early haha.
2021-04-21 19:21:19,wallstreetbets,Earnings and Russell reconstitution
2021-04-21 19:26:17,wallstreetbets,"Ah the Russel reconstitution finishes on the 28th of june. The ranking of whether this will join Russel 2000 would happen between the 7th of may and 25th of june.

Sounds interesting."
2021-04-21 19:29:21,wallstreetbets,"Not looking to push anything on anyone, but I‚Äôd also recommend a close look at their financials... specifically the current PE and dividend yield."
2021-04-21 19:33:26,wallstreetbets,"Already took a look at them but all past earnings and quarters have me thinking whether this is even a decent conpany. I guess i need to look much closer, i didn't do a terribly big amount of DD on them other than the earnings figures.

It really does look interesting though, gonna take a closer look."

2021-04-21 18:39:21,wallstreetbets,$SKLS - what do you expect the price to reach upcoming weeks ? Do you see it reaching anywhere near the 40‚Äôs or is that out of question ? Thanks and congrats on the returns!
2021-04-21 19:50:37,wallstreetbets,You know all their executives dumped their shares when the short report came out right? Not a good look long term lol
2021-04-21 18:44:15,wallstreetbets,"It was massively undervalued at 12 so I just had to go all in, shorts have been on skillz like heavy but cathie didn‚Äôt sell and so didn‚Äôt Morgan Stanley. My confidence is high with this stock as I think theyre a very disruptive and innovative company, like the shopify of gaming. Anyway I don‚Äôt have a PT for this, most likely holding for a few years"
2021-04-21 19:09:38,wallstreetbets,I had an interview with them. I did not get a good impression from their devs that their tech holds water. But it was only an interview and the crayon diet probably hasn't helped.
2021-04-21 19:18:21,wallstreetbets,"I'm very interested in your thoughts here. I feel like the business model is solid and I can see it moving into other types of applications (even though I dont think that is necessary to be a solid stock), but the ""tech"" is something that I honestly don't know how to evaluate. Can you expand on what your saying (if your not comfortable I understand).  Thanks!"
2021-04-21 17:54:30,wallstreetbets,Congrats

2021-04-21 19:22:33,wallstreetbets,Also I‚Äôm wondering why they lost so many subscribers from 700k. I‚Äôm sure it has to do with seasonality when it comes to sports but who knows. Hope they didn‚Äôt incur any heavy losses either.

2021-04-21 17:27:45,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm baffled that all this is happening because of one death. People get injured with products all day. PTON is still the apple of the fitness industry. I thought it would bounce when it was finding support around 101, but it continued to fall and fucked me. FUD and bear euphoria were at an all time high, and I thought the contrarian trade would hit it big considering how it was moving earlier in the day. It almost worked as we started up trending after I bought in but I ended up losing as we sold off even more. I do however think that anyone still holding tomorrow could be greatly rewarded. I timed it wrong but don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm wrong about a PTON reversal."
2021-04-21 19:02:55,wallstreetbets,"Quite honestly a bad way to phrase the situation, this person has had to have seen the warnings on the news, read a couple of articles about it from any number of news sites, or seem that it‚Äôs dropping like a box of rocks.

So if shit hits the fan, I'm confident they will come out on top again. Add to that their high customer satisfaction and customer retention, they're poised to do well in a continued bull or bear market.  Helps me sleep."

Day trade short sellers took advantage and pushed it lower on top of the initial 30% decline caused by Hwang's fund liquidating.

On top of that this is actually a value stock at a 10 PE-- the initial run up of the stock was due to it being severely undervalued from a covid overreaction. Right now, it is fairly valued if not undervalued, with the meme force supporting it to go further.

But then you still are paying your federal taxes, social security, Medicaid, property tax if you own a home, sales taxes on purchases, local taxes if your city has an income tax, etc.

In short: it depends. Making over $100,000 in America puts you ahead of the majority of people, so if you cant make that work then you're just dumb as hell."

It‚Äôll go up, maybe even another 10%, flatten out, pretend to have a breakout pattern and then plummet back to 19.50-20.50. Some people blame Cathie propping the price up but I blame the trendlines. Rocket does the same thing. I follow a small cap ticker that was up 17% today. It went from the bottom of its trend line, to the top. No farther, and I honestly don‚Äôt expect it to rise anymore tomorrow. It‚Äôs been in a descending channel for two months, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôll be there until it gets a catalyst.

2021-04-21 18:53:29,wallstreetbets,"We all know the legal and regulatory situations at the moment in their AG division. Still in litigation with Glyphosate and Dicamba. 

Every active ingredient in AG (irregardless if it‚Äôs from Bayer, BASF, Syngenta, Corteva, Nufarm...whatever) is under an incredible microscope right now. Meaning, even if Bayer controls their losses with Glyphosate, there is a never ending threat that another active ingredient gets thrown into the legal system. 

Do I think that‚Äôs fair? No. But the common public hates synthetic chemistries at the moment. Even though it was synthetic chemistries that helped alleviate  famine in many countries. 

With the acquisition of Monsanto (which is still not fully integrated), Bayer will have a lot of tools to do some amazing work with GMOs. That could (or should) be good news. These GMOs can grow taller, healthier, and produce more robust yields across large monoculture acreages. The problem? Again, the public hates the thought of GMOs. 

Let‚Äôs go into chemistry pipeline. Monsanto was not really in the business of discovering new active ingredients. So the merger doesn‚Äôt really improve Bayer‚Äôs chemical pipeline. 

And how does Bayer‚Äôs pipeline look in AG? I think it‚Äôs average and not ahead of their competitors. 

Biologicals. This is the future. These big AG chemical companies haven‚Äôt dove head first in these waters yet. You may hear about acquisitions in this space.....but what happens when the big AG Chem companies buy out smaller biological companies? Well...those potential innovations just vanish. 

In the pharma side I just don‚Äôt know much. So take this post with a huge grain of salt. All it takes is one miracle drug to bolster an entire company."

There is no way PLTR will realize half the value of the total budget estimate. This selection just means the firm is now a preferred vendor on a shortlist (of 31, most of which are previous incumbents). They will still have to bid and often compete for specific budgets and projects, but now they are pre-cleared in procurement 

A lot of names on that list are not exactly very innovative companies. See for example Civica. Not all of these groups are even run as traditional for-profit companies either, cf NHS SBS. Not a high bar for PLTR to clear. If they didn't manage to get on this list, shares would've dipped because bar is set pretty low.

This is only market moving news if/when they actually realize revenue and take substantial UkK market share from the 30 others on this list."

2021-04-21 16:59:19,wallstreetbets,"Good DD sir, I reached much the same conclusion about a week ago when I went long at 41. I can't really poke any holes in the logic, to me this is pretty much the epitomy of a value stock and now it's just a waiting game until the market comes to the same conclusion. Perhaps the disappointing Netflix report and positive Paramount+ numbers could give it the kickstart it needs."
2021-04-21 16:00:09,wallstreetbets,PE ratio compared to their peers alone is attractive enough to buy. Nice day today.
2021-04-21 16:54:42,wallstreetbets,"really awesome DD, glad to see someone actually dissect the financial statements and look at cash and debt instead of just top line items like rev/user growth. the only thing that i am cautious of is the streaming space is getting very crowded. i know they're all have their own unique things that they're doing but still at the end of the day its streaming. not every company will be successful long term. some might get bought/merge with others (im thinking of what happened with the airlines and how theres only a few major players in the US mkt). curious to hear if you think these companies will all be around/competitive with each other in the next 5-10 years"

2021-04-21 18:06:12,wallstreetbets,"So looking at the graph we know the price plummeted from 100 to 48 due to the hedge fund blowing up. 

What's causing the slower bleed down from 48 to 40 and what caused the initial run up?

It went from 15 to the 30s in about 8 months then in just 3 months exploded to the 90s before Hwang got caught with his pants down. So it's still above where if was before the big run up.

What if the big up and down was entire due to hedge fund buying and selling and now the price is back to where it should be naturally?"
2021-04-21 18:58:49,wallstreetbets,you don't mention the monstrous levels of debt this company has. that makes me not trust this DD. don't hide the bad.
2021-04-21 19:46:57,wallstreetbets,"god bless your faith in Pluto TV. 

Clearly you've never used it, but that's ok nobody else has either. A quick google search let's me know the ones who have used it aren't impressed. Hard to be free and still unimpressive in my opinion. Well except in markets undesirable to the big ad dollars. 

Also, putting a lot of faith in Bob Bakish and Sherri Redstone. 

As far as I can tell every Viacom asset is on the same steady downward path they've been following for the last decade and management couldn't be more stuck in the 'short term make wall street happy who cares about next year' thinking that is common when you're entire management is full of lawyers and finance bros. 

but maybe im wrong maybe the kids are dying for their MTV still. 

I do know that paramount the movie studio is the bottom of the current big studio movie making barrell.

I know I set a reminder to cancel my paramount+ and just did so the other day after watching the 5 compelling programs they have on it."

2021-04-21 16:59:50,wallstreetbets,"that's a pretty good point. NFLX spends $17bn on content production this year, VIAC trades at $25bn market right now. an acquisition of VIAC at this price level might be possible, especially because of their cable TV users of which 10 mil in total are expected to change to streaming services over the next years. in other words, buying a production studio (Paramount), streaming services (Paramount+, PlutoTV), users, news agency, and cable TV provider for 25bn is cheap as f."

2021-04-21 15:13:57,wallstreetbets,So sell puts?
2021-04-21 18:46:09,wallstreetbets,loool BB has shit premiums. I gain like $2 when I write 10 calls. Why would I even write any?
2021-04-21 15:44:12,wallstreetbets,"Cool, so I‚Äôll buy 1 call and 1 put for $40"
2021-04-21 17:22:49,wallstreetbets,I think $140 overnight is more realistic üöÄ

2021-04-21 15:26:30,wallstreetbets,Do you understand how patent valuation relates to a company's valuation? I would start there champ

You can stop reading here when it becomes clear that the person writing a DD on a cybersecurity company has nfi about cybersecurity... Surprised we didnt get a photo of the monitor to go with this"
2021-04-21 18:31:02,wallstreetbets,Why will the patent sale be for $15 billion minimum? Where is that number coming from?
2021-04-21 16:30:22,wallstreetbets,What makes u think he‚Äôs selling that many patents? For that amount of cash?
2021-04-21 15:18:50,wallstreetbets,The fact that there porfolio clients  in both iv and cybersecuirity has grown expenantioly with big brand names in just the past 4 month should show a huge updrend but untill they release any proof it will stay down
2021-04-21 19:18:32,wallstreetbets,BB is like a massive megaladon under the ocean getting bigger and bigger each day. Boomers can't see it because they don't understand it so they sell. BB is worth at least $20B right now and will be worth over 1T by the end of 2030.
2021-04-21 15:21:51,wallstreetbets,$40 overnight plus the short squeeze takes this to about $75
2021-04-21 15:37:22,wallstreetbets,"finally someone gets it!   congress can't let it happen without action and even then, the patents arent in the valuation so easy $40/sh.  i see it going much higher because of that as well ivy and spark kines but maybe not overnight.  it will take at least until friday.  monday at the latest"
2021-04-21 16:17:57,wallstreetbets,"right on, i collectively have 7.5K shares, stopped selling CC's recently and switched to putting some scratch here n there into weekly lottos anywhere b/w $8 - $10 strikes...."

2021-04-21 17:53:13,wallstreetbets,25% of retail float is shorted!!! this is a huge short squeeze!!! be careful when patent sale ofr$15 billion is annoucned.

2021-04-21 15:20:16,wallstreetbets,Do you understand the laws behind monopolies? If congress gets a full picture of how blackberry has monopoly in car operating system and iot cyber security they will break up blackberry.
2021-04-21 15:36:39,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs retarded about this ? Please be specific
2021-04-21 16:33:57,wallstreetbets,"I think it's even worse, pulling forth future revenue now, at cents to a dollar is bad for your longterm value. If there is shorting going on, I get why that is."
2021-04-21 15:29:03,wallstreetbets,"The analyst and value of blackberry never valued the 38k patents in the stock price. Go look at any analyst research. They don‚Äôt even value the future rev from ivy, radar, and blackbrrry spark unmatched security. Go research please"
2021-04-21 15:37:09,wallstreetbets,Many here don‚Äôt know that patents aren‚Äôt valued by any of the analystS. It‚Äôs free.
2021-04-21 18:48:55,wallstreetbets,"The thing is: BB is heavily relied on by the government as they secure 70% of the US government employees; in contrast, CRWD's customer base is mainly small businesses, and its hyper growth is fueled by the pandemic WFH. After 2020, it's natural to expect a NFLX like drop in CRWD's growth; but BB's orders are steady as rocks - governments only pay more on cyber security but never less. BB spent years to create/integrate the best tech and acquire the most important & hardest earned customers, and the rest will be much easier. CRWD's direct sales may look great on paper, but it may fail badly later. Check out how much CRWD's CEO owns the shares."
2021-04-21 18:38:48,wallstreetbets,Do you understand zero trust? Only blackberry can provide it on a single platform!! Platform called spark. Look it up. Crowdstrike had to partner with 3 other companies to provide half zero trust. Think about that for second.
2021-04-21 19:57:41,wallstreetbets,His stretched out asshole
2021-04-21 17:50:32,wallstreetbets,"he said ""most of the patents"" on ER call. most is minimum 50%. 2,000 companies still haven't paid for using these patents.

2021-04-21 15:21:24,wallstreetbets,Yea. 15 billion for patent is 30$ per share
2021-04-21 18:36:30,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I had the same thought. Haven't figured out how to profit off it yet except maybe selling calls to the credulous"
2021-04-21 17:57:23,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! Three Weeks
2021-04-21 17:38:57,wallstreetbets,this is my DD based on years of market and patent knowledge. do you even know how to value a company? have you ever looked at a single blackberry research notes by so called wallstreet analysts? none have inlcuded patent in their valuation.
2021-04-21 16:02:43,wallstreetbets,BB is a Canadian Company.  No Congress in Parliamentary system.  Canada is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government
2021-04-21 15:25:20,wallstreetbets,America doesn‚Äôt care about monopolies as long as no1 talks about it lol
2021-04-21 16:06:29,wallstreetbets,You proved there isn‚Äôt a monopoly in your post but I guess you didn‚Äôt realize it.
2021-04-21 16:34:12,wallstreetbets,"- Having a monopoly on soemthing they have 60% market share of.
- Monopoly on cyber security imagine thinking this is the only company selling cyber security (wtf)
- Thinking you have any clue how many patents they‚Äôre selling and any obscure idea of how much money they‚Äôre worth. You‚Äôre literally spouting nonsense in this part out your asshole.

-Thinking a companies share price will go up 500% off of a patent sale.

-Telling people not to sell calls because ‚Äúhedges want this (you have scizophrenia)

Yeah let me know if you want more details but basically you‚Äôre bag holding and tweaking out and giving misinformation"
2021-04-21 16:50:50,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, they are at least freeing up cash but liquidating their biggest asset is risky af. Who knows, maybe they will put it to good use and leverage themselves early enough into different sectors to become a leader. Time will tell"
2021-04-21 16:17:03,wallstreetbets,"Devil's advocate and trying to learn

How\why do you think all analysts missed something, that in your mind is so big.

For the record, I'm about 4k share deep in BB for <$9"
2021-04-21 15:38:04,wallstreetbets,"They talked about royalties in the first quarter, its almost about time to print them tendies"
2021-04-21 18:52:00,wallstreetbets,"For EDR (endpoint detection and response -- what everyone uses to try find them baddies) in large tech it's basically Crowdstrike vs CarbonBlack (VMWare), companies have had to invest more to get better endpoint visibility since everyone is YOLO'ing their machines at home. I dont think when those machines are brought back into the office they are going to want to relinquish that level of vis into endpoints. Likely these are going to just plateau here"
2021-04-21 19:21:09,wallstreetbets,"I understand zero trust very well, D&R is my bread and butter day job, it's definitely not a platform. It was heavily pushed by Google for its beyondCorp model after the 2009 attacks on Google China. You sound like the marketing team has done a number on you! Zero trust can be done in a lot of different ways and it definitely isn't related to blackberry spark."
2021-04-21 18:08:39,wallstreetbets,"Probably bit of both. Honestly, I'd love to see BB75 (holding 6k shares, 200 leaps), but the only way that's happening is if we start seeing actual revenues come in from all the announced QNX & IVY partnerships/contracts.

Until then, it's just potential (albeit a lot of it). And potential doesn't pay the bills - results do."
2021-04-21 17:13:18,wallstreetbets,"oh we cool gagsta ... so far, considering today's run of course, i'm a bit ahead w my tix.. we'll c what tomorrow brings; in either case lookin' for bof of us to get paid; you - your premiums, me - well... you kno how it goes :)"
2021-04-21 15:52:25,wallstreetbets,"do you understand valuation? have you ever read a single analyst research report? they all missed the patents (40k), Radar, Ivy, and unmatched blackberry spark platform.

2021-04-21 18:29:54,wallstreetbets,"Explain why there is $15b in value in patents within a company valued under $5b. Also, why are you the only person in the world that knows about these?

Please, stop pretending like you are an expert. People are going to follow you and lose real money."
2021-04-21 18:23:00,wallstreetbets,"You won't get a response on this because you just invalidated his entire post. My favorite is his knowledge of each of these 40k patents and how much they are valued.

People just make shit up around here and pretend like they are geniuses. I have seen almost 10 posts that predict a stock doubles overnight. Unreal."
2021-04-21 17:48:08,wallstreetbets,"* only company that meets the security and safety requirements for EV and car operating system. there's a reason volvo(most secure car) went with blackberry. No other operating system can meet these requirements!! that's essentially a MONOPOLY!!!!!
* NONE OF THOSE CYBERSECURITY COMPANIES WERE ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR GOVERNMENT AND 30,000 ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS FROM SOLARWIND HACK!! NOT EVEN MICROSOFT! SO THIS IS ESENTIALLY A MONOPOLY TOO, IF YOU PLAY THIS OUT OVER TIME. 
* John chen said ""most of the patents"" so most is more than 50%. they are critical for messaging and wireless and hardware. These patents are desired by google, apple, twitter, snap, facebook, etc.. 2,000 companies are infringing on these patents that haven't been monitized..so whoever buys them will be GOD!!

2021-04-21 17:12:46,wallstreetbets,Seen too many retail sell off their assets and then go down. there are so many things I see that companies do as a normal business practice that burns companies later.
2021-04-21 17:43:02,wallstreetbets,"good question but for the analysts. Patents are like gold now a days, so for every analyst to miss this component in their valuation is confusing to me. 

&#x200B;

Aol and kodak each sold like 500 patents for 1 billion dollar each. now blackberry wants to sell 20k patents per chen, these patents are desired by apple, google, snap, twitter, fb...etc. these are critical wireless and messaging patents. the company that buys these patents will control many other companies."
2021-04-21 18:57:03,wallstreetbets,"What I'm saying is the drop of growth not the drop of over all subscriptions. But I just wanna point out that BB's customer base has a very good quality & the market is so widely open that BB has its own opportunities to get a sizable share. While it may take more quarters to unfold BB has everything ready to get this part. (From CRWD's investor presentations we know that even w/ the hyper growth mode, CRWD can only get to <10% of the TAM by FY2025 - meaning BB won't see the real competitions here, every player is just competing w/ itself by FY2025, and w/ good product & correct marketing, growth in the cyber sector for BB is NO problem.)"

2021-04-21 17:41:50,wallstreetbets,Its been around and losing money for 20+ years.  Was a fifteen cent stock.  Its only a momentum play. Grab a chair if you hear the music stop.
2021-04-21 17:43:07,wallstreetbets,That momentum play ended at $46.
2021-04-21 18:00:00,wallstreetbets,Was a $2 stock last year. Maybe fall not yet done.
2021-04-21 14:29:21,wallstreetbets,On Thursday last week I realized I still had ~$650 in RH. I bought a 4/16 140c call for BNTX and 600 bucks of puppy themed moon stuff at a good price.  That did very well and then I dumped it all into PFE options on Friday and some earlier this week. Needless to say I'm feeling pretty good
2021-04-21 16:42:25,wallstreetbets,"Cash out now man, PFE will always punish you."
2021-04-21 14:55:25,wallstreetbets,Option Traders hate him!
2021-04-21 15:21:49,wallstreetbets,PFE call options have been brutal to me over the past 6 months.  I'd just cash out now and leave RH on a high note.

2021-04-21 17:04:51,wallstreetbets,Thats what i keep hearing but its been a lot of good news for BNTX and PFE and it doesnt look like its stopping anytime soon. Im sure i will be punished. Plan is to exit most positions prior to earnings May 4th
2021-04-21 15:45:47,wallstreetbets,Yeah that would be smart. But this is also wsb.. lmao I dont know i think itll keep going until at least earnings on the 4th. Maybe?
2021-04-21 15:49:52,wallstreetbets,Godspeed
2021-04-21 17:03:42,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah. Been a good week
2021-04-21 14:46:32,wallstreetbets,Gotta figure out my exit. I know PFE probably won't continue up until expiration but maybe until earnings in 2 weeks.
2021-04-21 17:16:45,wallstreetbets,My experience with PFE in the past is that it rarely reacts up on good news üòÅ it is a primo boomer stock

2021-04-21 14:53:08,wallstreetbets,"US stock market pretty much carries the rest of the world. Pensions and what not don't all come from tax dollars. They come from investments such as stocks, bonds, real estate, private markets, alternatives, etc.


Pick a random country like Japan. Its pension has a huge portion on US stocks and bonds.

If US stock market stagnates for extended periods of time, then the entire world is screwed.

People scream how pension to 401K is unfair and rigged. What people don't realize is when people get a pension, the pension manager is investing the money behind the scenes. For pensions, if the entity goes belly up, they get ""cut"". At least with 401K, you keep that money you risk yourself.

I believe US pensions expect at least 7% long term returns from the US stock market. Quite ridiculous of a number when those active professionals after fees shouldn't be able to get those returns in the short term with the current valuations. No wonder we constantly see headlines about public pensions needing a cut in the future."

2021-04-21 15:25:49,wallstreetbets,"you don't owe anything when you buy a contract. It is the same concept as buying shares, except options contract have expiration dates. Take the 40 contracts out of the post. OP bought a contract for $12.68. This $12.68 is the cost per *share*

However, options contracts are *bundles* of 100 shares and you can't buy fractional options. So, OP must pay $12.68 per share he controls for the option - hence the multiplying by 100.

So, for one contract, OP paid $12.68 x 100 (again, options are traded as bundles of 100 shares) for a price *per contract* of $1,268.



Let's expand one last time. OP paid $1,268 per contract to buy 40 contracts (AKA 40 call options). 
$1,268*40=$50,720 (how much it cost OP to enter this position)

OP can now sell these contracts for $1,865 each. 
$1865*40=$74,600 for a total profit of ~$24,000.

I can't dumb it down any further."
2021-04-21 16:01:27,wallstreetbets,"So, OP has to have the cash up front to buy it. He can't do it on credit, correct?  


And if the price goes down, OP doesn't owe anything, just loses out on the difference being sold. So like losing if you sold a stock below your buying price.   


So why would people buy shares and not just the stock itself? Sorry, I am still learning this part of the stock market. And thank you very much!"
2021-04-21 16:19:02,wallstreetbets,"Yes, if the price goes down (i.e. the underlying asset goes down), the options contracts lose value. Not only that, as time goes on, options contracts can lose value if the price doesn't move much at all. This is time decay component of contracts - since they have an expiration date, they lose value the closer to expiration since there is not as much *potential* to make money. Buying options further into the future can mitigate time decay, but you may notice, these options also cost more/are more expensive.

To answer your question on why people buy options - options (and by extension derivatives) are a tool. A tool for a certain role in portfolios. Options can be used as a form of insurance (hedging) or buffers from large market moves. They can be used to generate cash on an asset that is trading flat. They can be used to limit risk.

For me, and this sub, options provide *leverage* without the capital  required to own a proportional amount of shares. To clarify - to own 100 shares of Tesla, I would need ~$74,000. To *own* 100 shares using an option contract, like OP, all he needed was $1,268. Does that make sense? To bring it all together, OP had to pay $1,268 instead $74,000 to *control* 100 shares of Tesla. However, when you buy shares you own them indefinitely or until you sell. With options, if your option is out of the money when the expiration date comes, you are left with nothing."
2021-04-21 16:27:36,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense. I just see people always posting options and I never understood why or how it was really making money.   


Thanks for the info and taking the time to write back to me!"
2021-04-21 17:24:37,wallstreetbets,Options didn't really click for me either until I finally bought one (just a few weeks ago). It you've got a hundred dollars laying around you can get on your trading platform and find a cheap one for $0.98 (x100) and get started and it will help things click.

2021-04-21 13:42:38,wallstreetbets,"I wrote a business case GoPro 4 years ago (2017 share price \~$8) for a project while doing my masters.

2  Other ecosystem of cameras ""Angel"" (small compact non-Fisheye lens) for friends and ""Guardian"" (Compact Zoom cameras) For parents/family.

They would all sync up in the app so you could share and edit your film from any perspective in the app.

I'm really curious to hear about Quik in the earnings too, it's one of the simplest ad-free apps for video editing on mobile, though I've never bought an in-app purchase. It's amazing how popular GoPros are as helmet cams for motorcyclists (just search ""motovlog"" on youtube) and they still haven't properly catered to that market with good accessories or partnership with a helmet maker. Even Sena have partnered with helmet makers to get models built with or for their equipment.

Going on sentiment, the only thing I'd say you shouldn't overlook is the professional use of GoPros. They're used a lot more than one might think in filming movies, TV shows, documentaries, commercials, real estate tours, and even in academia. Back-Bone sells modified ones compatible with professional lenses that expand their use quite a bit in that segment of the market."

2021-04-21 13:06:39,wallstreetbets,This is basically a lottery ticket. Higher Strike Price = Less expensive buy in.
2021-04-21 13:22:38,wallstreetbets,"For out of the money strike prices, the closer the strike price is to the market price the more expensive the premium is for calls (generally). For example, for MVIS 7/16 calls these are the premiums per contract:

* $12 -$3.80
* $15 - $2.90
* $20 - $1.80
* $25 - $1.50
* $30 - $1.15
* $35 - $0.95"
2021-04-21 19:11:17,wallstreetbets,"You don't need it to reach the strike price, the closer it gets the more the option is worth. You can sell the option at any time between buy and expiration, provided there are buyers."

2021-04-21 13:32:43,wallstreetbets,On the other hand if retail investors drive the price before a buyout it could still be a good play short term.  Definitely not one I'd try and squeeze every drop out of. Did that w/ARKG before it corrected and left $30k on the table by not taking the damned profits and ended up breaking even.  Lesson learned.

I've read lots of analysis talking about how Roku needs to start creating its own original content to compete with other streaming services, and I keep wondering, ""Do these analysts even know what Roku does?"". Roku is NOT a streaming service. Yes, there is a ""Roku channel"" on your Roku. I hardly ever use it, but I use my Rokus (Roki?) all the time for Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, etc. First, it has an incredibly simple interface, and the apps published on the Roku system have far superior interfaces than those on other streaming devices (Chromecast, Firestick, etc.). Second, the network connectivity is far superior to any of those other devices. The only thing I've found that comes close to giving me the same stutter-free streaming of a Roku is a Mac Book Pro. The antenna is that good. Third, most people who use a Roku become Roku fans. I'd compare the passionate affection that people have for their Rokus to that people had for their Tivos (may it rest in peace, dear friend). Roku is a rock solid equipment and software company. It is not a streaming company."

When I began investing, and going long and modest on stuff, I read up on all my investments. 

Fool would run an article: ""Here's why DDD is a risky buy and why 3D printing stocks should be avoided."" All 3D stocks ended up either rising modestly after a long run, or flat out losing a few points over the next day. 

Then, later in the week - THE SAME AUTHOR would post an article: ""DDD is a buy, and you can't convince me otherwise."" The stocks in the 3D printing space would tend to do better on those days.

Look at the 6 month chart and tell me with a straight face how tesla is getting crushed with no end in sight. Arkk is up 100% on the year, but its had a correction of 15-20% lately sp the stock is done forever. Come on."
2021-04-21 13:13:23,wallstreetbets,TSLA and ARKK are the same fucking ticker lol.
2021-04-21 14:46:33,wallstreetbets,That is 100% correct right now REITS and airline stocks are a good investment for US reopening. 25% of US population are fully vaccinated Tech stock are being corrected right now.
2021-04-21 14:26:32,wallstreetbets,"I dont understand how Tesla would go down, like doesn't musk have some lithium monopoly because of some cia backed war?"
2021-04-21 15:09:09,wallstreetbets,"I mean, valuations were insanely high and people take profit, which causes other people to take profit as they don't want to get burned when they are already up 100%+ since 2020. The companies in ARKK are still really good, now they are just victims of their own success"
2021-04-21 16:58:07,wallstreetbets,"There are many money managers that outperform for 1-3 years, and almost none over 20, especially as there's more money in the bucket to manage. Just remember that. Just because a strategy outperformed one year doesn't mean the same fund manager will outperform the next. Wood may be mamma but her outperformance will, in all statistical likelihood, come to an end, whether it's starting now or there's still more time to go has to be seen."

up 3.5% today and in the green for 2021..."

2021-04-21 15:17:15,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs more or less an open platform for writing articles (like investorplace). I just set a Google alert for the authors I like, like David Gardener, rather than sift through the website.

Regardless of the stock, they have the same salesy disclaimer at the end about it not being one of the 10 stocks, which I think offends the eyes of a lot of autists around here, but it‚Äôs just an ad."
2021-04-21 17:18:07,wallstreetbets,"Aye, I can't touch GME because I live in New Zealand. When it goes I'll be sleeping, getting ready for work or working. The risk of me being a bag holder is high due to time zone fuckery. I could set up any auto sell at a certain price. BUT with a limited amount of share providers and them putting a trading halt in during the first pop I can't trust they wont do so again. 

Go forward my Euro and American muppets."
2021-04-21 19:03:30,wallstreetbets,"that seems to be the general consensus. David Gardner, Tom Gardner, and their teams are very good (but you have to listen to the podcast or pay to get their picks, thoughts, etc.)  
all of the free stuff, on the other hand, published on the website is garbage."
2021-04-21 15:24:42,wallstreetbets,"It's working as intended. Articles are boring and faceless, easy to brush aside. A podcast on the other hand gives you people, emotion, you start to relate to them and like them. You're even excyzing their behavior and pretending they're on ""your side"" or likes gme, lol what a joke. It's Stockholm syndrome... The fool isn't your friend, they don't want to help you.

AMC, like most of the companies affected by Covid (and I‚Äôm not blaming them for this at all), sold additional shares to raise capital. Look at their market cap vs. stock price now vs. before Covid. It‚Äôs not really their fault or a bad play but they were dealt a really shitty hand."

But I also started listening to the podcast (which I think started as a radio show) at age like 18 so I don‚Äôt really know what conclusion I‚Äôm supposed to come up with."
2021-04-21 19:21:07,wallstreetbets,Australia here. It was a really stressful time the first time around. I'd wake up randomly at 3 in the morning and check the app and GME was going bonkers while the app was crashing. Guh...

2021-04-21 19:06:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm in East Asia myself, same problem with trying to get on board with this stuff. The market opens at 9:30 PM, trying to be involved with something like GME makes it hard to get sleep."
2021-04-21 15:33:50,wallstreetbets,"I get where you‚Äôre coming from but, and I mean this with total respect, I think you might be a little overly cynical about them. Not saying you‚Äôre not right that the media is full of bad actors but I‚Äôve never given them money and I‚Äôve learned a TON about the market and investing in general in the last 10+ years I‚Äôve been listening. Plus I‚Äôm both commending and criticizing the organization for things they do right and wrong. Not sure why you‚Äôre so hostile toward them."
2021-04-21 19:28:47,wallstreetbets,"Which is fine in my eyes. The podcast hosts probably say it once every episode but they‚Äôre all about buy and hold long term. That‚Äôs why they love Costco and Apple. It‚Äôs not wrong that those are good investments. They are. Sam Adam‚Äôs and nyt will both likely be around a long time and grow with the market. They‚Äôre not ‚Äústonks‚Äù but they‚Äôre still solid. 

They also talk about weed stocks and I actually heard about CRTO, FSLY, and NOVAVAX on the podcast way before they all exploded."

2021-04-21 13:12:16,wallstreetbets,Specially if they are penny stocks
2021-04-21 14:44:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah IMO places like Stocktwits never really follow fundamentals, just momentum both ways. If a stock has dropped 10% in a month, everyone will be saying ‚Äúget out now while you can‚Äù Then, the stock recovers and the sentiment completely flip flops lol"
2021-04-21 15:40:28,wallstreetbets,"There‚Äôs nothing valuable about that. Nor are the few shit talking bears. 

There‚Äôs SOME useful information and legit hype one way or another, but it‚Äôs largely just the most window licking of YouTube comments... wall to wall."
2021-04-21 15:29:14,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, from Jan20-Jan21 I made >200% gains just by picking a few of their recommendations (mostly Dave's), SHOP played a big part in that. Went from 3.3k to 12k. Then, I bought a bunch of GME at an average price of \~$200. Sat on that till they dropped to $50 and panic sold, leaving me at about $3k. Learned a valuable lesson about greed and self-delusion...

Anyway, after that I invested another 3.6k and bought some of their current recommendations - up 12%/$800 on the month so far, but the real win is that I'm again invested into companies that I actually believe in. (Not doggin' on anybody invested in GME, but to me it seems that the value there is based largely on speculation and not how things are actually going)"
2021-04-21 18:42:44,wallstreetbets,Yea! He takes 1/2 hour to get to the point. I hit the 10 second fast forward about 1000 times per podcast.

2021-04-21 19:40:34,wallstreetbets,"I've seen others try explain this, but still seem to be missing the point a bit so I'll try too.

Podcasts are listened to via applications such as iTunes, Spotify, and other online streaming services.

Navigations of these platforms require knowledge of modern web app user interfaces, stuff that we as the younger generation take for granted.

Older generations either didn't grow up using computers, and those that did at best learned using Web 1.0 rather than react.js interfaces of Web 2.0. And as a result are less likely to \*discover\* the online version of their streamed content, but those who are more savvy will seek it out anyway if they know how to use it.

Traditional existing audeinces as a result stick to the digital equivalent of print media and wont go further due to their range of comfortability, or alternatively stick to traditional AM/FM radio.

The form of the communication is not the point being made, but rather the steps required to access the content.

Random price targets ($100 by x date with nothing to back it) is another one. Information/rumors without sources or with random sources like a single reddit comment too. 

Basically anything besides fundamental analysis, industry analysis, leadership, upcoming catalysts, growth plans, etc. are probably a waste of time. Take every DD with a grain of salt but if there are recurring themes that have logical explanations then maybe it's worth pursuing. 

It's really all about healthy skepticism. Just remember that everyone has an agenda at the end of the day, even some random redditor on a forum (they want their stock to go up or the stock they sold to go down so they feel better about themselves). Best to just develop a strategy and stick to it. 

I don't think you necessarily need any premium news sites, but the people who win in Finance have *timely* access to *relevant*, *accurate* data.

Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs 2 billion for now + 800 million 2.8 billion

BB market cap this morning was 4.6 billion

4.6 minus 2.8 billion cash on hand = 1.8 billion

They are giving blackberry the WHOLE company, with 68% ev market, spark security, Amazon partnership with ivy, qnx in 175 million vehicles, 700 - 900 million revenue per year a valuation of 1.8 billion

Let me say it again, the whole company for only 1.8 billion valuation (some people here say 3 billion when factoring in debt, either way it‚Äôs low)

After the covid crash last year BB market cap hit 1.7 billion, so after including potential cash on hand BB is trading at the same market cap today right now as it was at the bottom of covid crash


Edit: people in here talking about debt, blackberry has always had debt and is an ongoing part of their valuation, it doesn‚Äôt change the fact of what the valuation was 12 months ago to what it is now when you include the patent sale, they have less debt now than they use to and they are also going to have more cash than they use to. The market cap is still extremely low valuation to give the company after you factor in the cash they will have soon. From what I was able to find it seems debt was only 459 million in November

2021-04-21 13:38:04,wallstreetbets,"This post made me look it up and realize QNX is owned by Blackberry. I'm a software engineer that mostly works on embedded systems for business and private jets, and our QNX based systems are in just about every airplane made by Cessna and Gulfstream. So it's not just automotive industry where it has a significant market share. I like the stock, I'm in."

2021-04-21 11:50:11,wallstreetbets,"It has a $700mn cash on hand, and $700mn in long-term debt.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BB/blackberry/cash-on-hand](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BB/blackberry/cash-on-hand)

BB patents were worth roughly $2.5bn in 2019, but plenty have already been sold off and would have already contributed to the $700mn cash.

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4302309-blackberry-real-story-is-in-patents](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4302309-blackberry-real-story-is-in-patents)

[https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/blackberry-sells-smartphone-patents-to-huawei](https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/blackberry-sells-smartphone-patents-to-huawei)

So I'd argue that a $2bn valued patent portfolio is probably overestimating. Not to mention around $350mn in revenue in 2020 came from those patents, so selling off patents brings revenue down to like $600mn.

[https://businessquant.com/blackberry-revenue-by-segment](https://businessquant.com/blackberry-revenue-by-segment)

So at best you're probably looking at a company with around $1.5bn on hand after debt and after sales of patents, with reduced revenues.

I can't find any reliable data for a 68% EV market share? But you're certainly overestimating QNX revenue growth. Total revenue for software (like QNX) was less than $700mn dollars in 2020 - with 175mn cars using it, BB literally must be making under $4 per car per year. Not a huge revenue driver. Not to mention most car companies use multiple operating systems, including android and linux. Who's to say google won't just invest heavily into android to beat out the market?

Spark isn't anything impressive. A comparable company making security products in the same exact category (IoT, event management, UEM) is Cisco. Cisco trades at 4.67 P/S vs BBs 5.42 P/S. Not to mention if you're actually talking cybersec, BB isn't a significant player at all.

Blackberry IVY could be interesting, but without seeing it in action we have no idea how well the software will work - AWS partners with loads of companies and provides cloud services/machine learning services to loads of companies. And it's slightly worrying that they're using AWS IoT tech rather than relying on BB IoT tech.

Revenue is decreasing, profits are decreasing. It's not this hugely undervalued tech company. It's up like 30% from pre-january spike, up 100% from April 2020. At best a very long term play hoping that Ivy / QNX can be monetised better - looking at a 5 - 10 year timeline. More of a r/investing stock tbh."

This does not mean things can change in the future but there is a reason why it got slammed back to 8-9 dollars at least at this current moment. With that being said, if you were to buy in now it could turn out more lucrative but in the long term only most likely."

It's a luck play.

Will BB ever shoot up 200-300% for a few weeks/months? Yes probably.

Let‚Äôs assume $1B in sales in the near term (~2 years) so $680m gross profit, $560 operating expenses excluding depreciation so $120m earnings.

2.7B/120M = 21.26

Doesn‚Äôt seem unreasonable of a valuation.   Even your (very wrong) evaluation of $1.8B/120M = 15.

15 isn‚Äôt super cheap for a yawn stock with little in terms of growth and year of declining fortunes and revenue.

Valuation will be even worse when you factor in taxes and interest.  Blackberry doesn‚Äôt make money, they could have an impossible 115% EV market share and they still wouldn‚Äôt be making money.

[https://businessquant.com/blackberry-revenue-by-segment](https://businessquant.com/blackberry-revenue-by-segment)

Considering BB sells other software, it must be below $4. Without releasing their pricing model we won't know the exact figure, but it literally cannot be above $4 in revenue per car per year unless they're falsely reporting revenue segments.

And how do you mean ""increase pricing""? They can't just increase prices without adding value as well (which will add costs). They're not the only players in this market. 

[https://www.graphicalresearch.com/industry-insights/1640/europe-automotive-operating-system-os-market](https://www.graphicalresearch.com/industry-insights/1640/europe-automotive-operating-system-os-market)

QNX makes up about 40% of the market for automotive operating systems (this is europe, can't find figures for globally but there's no reason this should be significantly different elsewhere). They're losing ground in this market. They're predicted to lose ground significantly faster in certain segment of automotive OS as well, like infotainment.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/680077/car-infotainment-os-market-share/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/680077/car-infotainment-os-market-share/)

And not to mention this isn't including plans for automotive companies like VW who are planning on making one single holistic own-brand OS for their own cars.

[https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/vw-steps-software-push-vwos-operating-system](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/vw-steps-software-push-vwos-operating-system)

There's tons of options for automotive manufacturers, it's by no means a cornered market to the point BB can just up QNX prices without a response. Not to mention - whats the barrier to entry? What serious competitive advantage does BB have that enormous tech giants (that can run up huge losses if needed) like Google and Microsoft couldn't replicate? Especially considering android and Microsoft embedded systems are serious competitors."
2021-04-21 17:01:08,wallstreetbets,"No, that's not giving IVY 0% growth. You're just purely speculating on IVY and expecting it to shoot revenue up massively. What customers use IVY? What percentage of cars? what revenue/profit does that bring in? What percentage of that is shared to Amazon?

Assuming a revenue of 600mn after patents sold, the company would trade at a valuation of 5 x its revenue. Lets take their partner for BB IVY, Amazon for a comparison.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/revenue)

Adding cash on hand + taking away long term debt (same as what we did with BB) Amazon is worth $1.75tn. Revenue of $386bn. Therefore trades at 4.5 x revenue after add cash + taking away debt. Do you seriously think BB should be trading at **significantly** higher multiples than Amazon? Even though BB is a business with declining revenue, doesn't make a profit and is fireselling revenue-generating assets? What sort of logic is that?

Not to mention - licensing is actually where revenue growth has been driven. BB has two segments for revenue, software & services and licensing. Q1 2020 licensing revenue was 79mn, software was 168mn. Q1 2021? 108mn for licensing and 151mn for software.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/680077/car-infotainment-os-market-share/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/680077/car-infotainment-os-market-share/)

As for the EV market share - it looks like 68% of EV, sure. But they're only in 40% of connected cars in Europe, I'm guessing similar figures globally. Not to mention they're losing market share to Linux and Windows - losing in the overall automotive software markets and specific automotive software markets, like infotainment. Not to mention - QNX literally makes less than $4 per car per year. Like I said, it's not a significant revenue driver. 

Why do you think that the market doesn't realise that IVY exists? Or that selling patents will bring in cash? The stock is up 100% from April 2020, and 30+% from pre january spikes. That's already a big growth."

This is a trap and I encourage people to stay away at least until they prove they can actually grow revenues organically. The stock isn't going anywhere until then. There is a huge difference between BB and companies like CRWD. BB usually over promises and under delivers and CRWD/other actual SaaS business are always the other way around."

There **could** be a lot of potential IVY customers. But there's no need to use IVY. As long as there's correct compatabilities there are plenty of companies collecting & analysing vehicle data. Here's 10 automotive data platform companies:

Microsoft is working with VW, Google with Ford. They already have customers - there's none I'm aware of that have announced with IVY.

I'm clueless to how you feel PLTR, CRWD and SNOW are comparable companies to BB? You've named a big data analytics company, a cloud security company and data warehousing company? They're literally not even similar to eachother, let alone BB. Not to mention - CRWD, PLTR, and SNOW have 92.7%, 47% and 117% in YoY revenue growth respectively. BB in the last year BB revenue has **dropped** 13%."
2021-04-21 17:50:53,wallstreetbets,68% of the ev software market share
2021-04-21 13:08:44,wallstreetbets,I see
2021-04-21 13:09:22,wallstreetbets,"I think the other guy provided more insight, but thanks for the answer haha"
2021-04-21 18:06:35,wallstreetbets,28 or 56k?
2021-04-21 18:38:57,wallstreetbets,"Yes they said they will start selling ivy in October before it releases in febuary

And if ivy causes Bb revenue to grow 50% eventually and they already have revenue similar to crwd pltr and snow then what?

While qnx doesn‚Äôt have recurring revenue ivy does"
2021-04-21 17:54:43,wallstreetbets,I am also pretty certain software from other companies are implemented in a car which uses BB software. Do you have a source that states 68% of EV vehicles use BB software exclusively?
2021-04-21 14:26:40,wallstreetbets,>I think the other guy provided more hindsight
2021-04-21 18:51:26,wallstreetbets,"And by the looks of it IVY enable vehicles won't ship until at **least** 2023.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-autos-amazon-blackberry-idUKKBN28B50K](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-autos-amazon-blackberry-idUKKBN28B50K)

So at best, if IVY is incredibly successful, you're holding a stock (probably at a lost) for at least 2-3 years if you're expecting the market to catch up to a successful IVY launch. Might be a good investment, but tbh, waiting 3 years for an investment to pay off? That's /r/investing shit.

And sorry, what're you basing IVY boosting BB revenue by 50% off? Pure speculation? It still wouldn't be comparable to CRWD, PLTR, SNOW. They're different companies, different products. If BB started growing revenue by 50% YoY then obviously I think the share price should increase accordingly. But where's the evidence for that? It'd be a huge turnaround to reach 50% growth after 13% declines being quite regular."
2021-04-21 17:57:32,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm saying blackberry is in 68% of ev‚Äôs
2021-04-21 19:02:39,wallstreetbets,"Isn‚Äôt that what the point of speculation is? many stocks go up every day just on speculation, people are speculating right now how much money LMND can make before they even make it and pushing the stock up. Ivy will be selling data and have recurring revenue, so you can already gather from that it will make much more revenue than qnx

That link is from December, they said in this quarterly report 2 weeks ago that ivy is getting an early release in October and full release in feb"
2021-04-21 17:58:52,wallstreetbets,This statement is correct but very different to the one in the post.
2021-04-21 19:16:28,wallstreetbets,"Yes they'll release the tech in February. But the actual release of those cars onto the road will take longer. Automotive companies have a long lead time. 

Yes it'll likely make more revenue from QNX. But that's not hard at less than $4 per car. 

Wild speculation stating that BB will somehow start achieving 50% YoY revenue growth due to IVY is absurd. Especially when they're facing far strong competitors in Google & Microsoft who also already have customers. Not to mention the far stronger talent at Google & Microsoft + their ability to run pretty much any burn rate they want.

I'm not saying BB won't go up in price. I'm just stating that growth will take a **long** time. And that growth likely won't be putting it at levels we've seen this year for a long time. BB staying @ $25 or above won't be something we see for many many years."
2021-04-21 18:21:43,wallstreetbets,"Well that‚Äôs what I meant, guess every word here has to be perfect

There I updated OP by removing 1 word"
2021-04-21 19:19:20,wallstreetbets,"Stocks go up well before the revenue, once it gets close and there‚Äôs even just a hint of it then it‚Äôs gone

If you wait until the very day of a revenue increase before you buy your already too late

Blackberry market share with qnx is increasing, and all those will be potential ivy customers, I haven‚Äôt seen any increase in google or Microsoft"
2021-04-21 19:43:35,wallstreetbets,"Explain FSR to me

$0 revenue, the stock is going up because of a car they are releasing next year it could take 2 years for that car to start showing any meaningful revenue and the stock is already going up and has a market cap of 4.4 billion

2021-04-21 11:59:43,wallstreetbets,"If you go buy another 140k right now, you‚Äôll then only be down about 25%, greatly increasing your performance!"
2021-04-21 10:36:40,wallstreetbets,This is where most people on this sub would double down.
2021-04-21 10:18:24,wallstreetbets,"April news on new LIDAR sample will come soon. Kramer doesn‚Äôt like space lasers, shorts keep dumping every day it seems. Hold for buyout."
2021-04-21 10:02:18,wallstreetbets,"You bought the week of its peak. total retard move, we accept you with open arms"
2021-04-21 08:52:36,wallstreetbets,"Jesus, you need an intervention from Jesus on this play to become profitable. Usually I just see -50% on options but nope you madman you did it on shares alone. 

Do you have a DD thread that made you do this? I love the dedication and would love to lose money with you."
2021-04-21 12:30:24,wallstreetbets,"I decided to YOLO into MVIS Monday premarket after staying up all night developing my plan for the stock. 

Monday morning I sold all my RKT for a small loss and threw everything I had at MVIS, doubling my position to 500 shares and averaging down to $11.49.

Today is a good day. LFG.

2021-04-21 10:25:10,wallstreetbets,Damn! So you‚Äôre the one who bought my shares!! I bought at $2.40 and bailed out at $20 because it went up everyday without significant news. It just didn‚Äôt seem right
2021-04-21 18:09:51,wallstreetbets,Member when MVIS was a pennystock? I MEMBER
2021-04-21 12:09:39,wallstreetbets,Wow you guys are actually coming for me!!!!
2021-04-21 11:51:12,wallstreetbets,"This stock requires serious sea legs. Welcome aboard the SS Moonski, matey! Arrrrrrgh!

2021-04-21 16:09:45,wallstreetbets,"60% short interest, 4k shares left to short. They haven't returned any AH yet....this rocket is fueling up u fuckers"
2021-04-21 11:28:36,wallstreetbets,I first bought MVIS at $1.50 in 2016 - I genuinely believe in their tech so it‚Äôs a good stock despite being the latest ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù of the sub.
2021-04-21 11:53:21,wallstreetbets,"This is my fear. I make the right call at the wrong time. Buy in @20, stock dumps to 10, and then wow! It moons! Everybody's going nuts!!!

...and it ""moons"" to 19.

""but look, it's up almost +100%!!! wow!!!""

fuck me"
2021-04-21 17:48:51,wallstreetbets,I've been in for awhile at $2.32.  We just need a buyout!
2021-04-21 12:10:01,wallstreetbets,MVIS just broke the $12 resistance. Godspeed you glorious bastard.
2021-04-21 08:54:55,wallstreetbets,Right there with ya!!! Except on a much much much smaller scale! üòÖ 250shares
2021-04-21 09:23:05,wallstreetbets,Yeah my pants are tight. Hell yeah.
2021-04-21 13:20:01,wallstreetbets,"I'm down on MVIS too, not that I have much money to lose anyway. The plus side is my current value is $420 which is 6.9% of my account."
2021-04-21 16:15:41,wallstreetbets,"I own 50k shares, will add more by end of this month."
2021-04-21 15:42:10,wallstreetbets,"MVIS will pay off my friend, I have been in for over a year and I wouldn‚Äôt sell if my life depended on it. I have never had this much confidence in a company before"
2021-04-21 12:04:03,wallstreetbets,This is going to at least $40. I wouldn't worry too much.
2021-04-21 10:36:55,wallstreetbets,Timed the top pretty good
2021-04-21 12:54:46,wallstreetbets,Gl my friend. I have a very good feeling about this. Up almost 20% today is crazy! I'm buying more when I get paid tomorrow!
2021-04-21 12:00:30,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands + Lidar news = bye bye shorts
2021-04-21 10:21:43,wallstreetbets,I bought $400 at 10.93 then dropped immediately lol
2021-04-21 11:38:06,wallstreetbets,"Aped out yesterday and bought a couple 12c for 5/21 at market open. I then went on robinhood and liquidated the shit stocks I was too embarrassed to transfer to fidelity to barely scrape up enough for a 14c 5/21 like a true retard monke. Fuck it.

BRING ME MY FUCKING TENDIES REEEEEE ü¶çüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"
2021-04-21 12:06:09,wallstreetbets,Man... I remember this penny stock at the beginning of the pandemic. I am such a fool for selling!
2021-04-21 12:53:25,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs your average? Hope you make tons of money on MVIS- I love this stock - put most of my eggs in her basket!!
2021-04-21 09:29:35,wallstreetbets,Impressive retardation. I'm only down 10%.
2021-04-21 09:19:38,wallstreetbets,Well I mean you waited until it was at $20 to buy in when literally December/Jan it was less than $5. FOMO is not a good way to make money
2021-04-21 10:22:43,wallstreetbets,And I cry when I lose $10
2021-04-21 09:49:07,wallstreetbets,LOL I put 50$ on it thought I was YOLOING at 10.27 a share
2021-04-21 15:37:51,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea what MVIS is, but you could be the next DFV so I'm in for $10,000. I hope you know what you're doing because I  sure don't."

2021-04-21 13:36:36,wallstreetbets,Did you try turning it off and then back on?
2021-04-21 15:38:12,wallstreetbets,This thing is going to double and you‚Äôll be happy to be even.
2021-04-21 16:25:22,wallstreetbets,I went in on 6 calls yesterday glad I did. It will come back I believe in them greatly
2021-04-21 17:33:24,wallstreetbets,Closed at **twelve-fiddy** today. 20% increase.
2021-04-21 11:13:27,wallstreetbets,"MVIS will bounce back, it's undervalued and heavily shorted. It's up for sale, so either it will be bought by Microsoft or some big player... They have lot of patents...don't lose hope."
2021-04-21 09:41:20,wallstreetbets,Microvision? Should've gone for Microstrategy
2021-04-21 09:49:45,wallstreetbets,Thanks for a good nut

2021-04-21 16:09:40,wallstreetbets,This is the WSB I signed up for.
2021-04-21 17:12:38,wallstreetbets,"When I was two years old I was getting ready for church and had a shoe cabinet fall on me breaking my leg in two places.

My mother blamed God as we were intending to worship him that day and he really hurt us. We stopped going to church and any show of religion throughout my childhood was questioned and mocked.

I have just said my first prayer in 25 years for you sir. Godspeed to you."

2021-04-21 12:07:21,wallstreetbets,"I just like this stock!!! The value play is there. The shorts are just angry pissy people who don‚Äôt like seeing the future.
And looking on what‚Äôs happening today, I‚Äôm seeing a hope in its resurgence!:)"
2021-04-21 12:14:07,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôll be making that money back, friend.  Just added another 100 shares and 5 call options.  MVIS about to lift all boats."

2021-04-21 16:29:38,wallstreetbets,You were supposed to buy the dip at 10$....
2021-04-21 16:41:00,wallstreetbets,You could write off a year's income with that capital loss. üôå
2021-04-21 18:30:46,wallstreetbets,up 20. need 30 more.

2021-04-21 16:43:17,wallstreetbets,I accidentally bought $1000 worth of MVIS in April of 2020 when I first started trading. Looking back I now I realize god gave me a chance and I shit in his mouth
2021-04-21 10:20:43,wallstreetbets,MVIS was at .22 cents and you thought it was a solid idea to load the account at $20.50 ? Would love to know if you have any solid logic behind the trade ?
2021-04-21 10:41:36,wallstreetbets,"Just bought 50 shares of MVIS, too. Lets see where the ride goes üìà"
2021-04-21 10:55:59,wallstreetbets,You timed the shit out of that.

2021-04-21 12:10:15,wallstreetbets,On the other hand I bought at $10.74 based on some post here the other day and only wish I‚Äôd bought more
2021-04-21 12:12:06,wallstreetbets,"cant believe I paper handed MVIS a year ago when it was at 2-3$. I knew it was a BUY but couldn‚Äôt tell how long it was going to be manipulated for, so I backed out of it. Oh well"
2021-04-21 12:41:54,wallstreetbets,How can stock behave like an option?
2021-04-21 12:42:57,wallstreetbets,There gotta be PR at eod. Big players already position themselves. Market Manipulation at its best. Sorry for those who paperhanded
2021-04-21 12:50:12,wallstreetbets,I mean today is a good day for you but still

2021-04-21 13:10:10,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for reminding me, got a 13% return. Some ppl sell pls so I can buy the dip"
2021-04-21 13:11:10,wallstreetbets,lmao reading all the discussions idk if I should hold out for it to go lower or buy-in

2021-04-21 08:55:39,wallstreetbets,This is a very long term play. You better let these shares rest for a while without looking at the red.
2021-04-21 11:25:49,wallstreetbets,Bit skeptical on the account. Literally only posts MVIS
2021-04-21 10:30:26,wallstreetbets,Bruh just put into a savings account like GME.

yur still dumb tho"
2021-04-21 10:18:40,wallstreetbets,Should have put in GME/AMC
2021-04-21 10:39:31,wallstreetbets,Not as good as GME.
2021-04-21 14:41:12,wallstreetbets,Why did u buy at the high? This ain‚Äôt GME. The best entry point is $11 and the best exit is $19.

Realize nobody here knows you, your joking about losing more money than 50% of the country doesn‚Äôt have and may never have.  If you‚Äôre in a posn. where $72k really doesn‚Äôt matter, good for you, otherwise acting like it‚Äôs funny for a group of strangers isn‚Äôt funny.  Before you ask why I care or am being harsh, I‚Äôve seen families lose 50% of their assets which prevented them from buying a house, or sending a very smart kid to college, and other life changing opportunities lost and I promise you, mine found any humor.  Sorry that‚Äôs my weekly rant.  People work too hard for lots less to act like it‚Äôs funny and doesn‚Äôt matter.  I apologize"

2021-04-21 17:38:47,wallstreetbets,"Cool. Well. Thats risky on a good day. That is a fairly capital intensive industry, making it even harder to succeed and not just that, to outclass internal developments enough to make it worth it for a company to license their solution instead.


Good on you for jumping in. Hope you got strong arms to hold those bags and maybe they'll come back for you!

Godspeed!"
2021-04-21 15:02:34,wallstreetbets,"No unfortunately (or if your swing trading fortunately) we broke out of the wedge we were in so there isn't much support. My understanding is the consistent rips and dips are a battle between to major Whales. Some on the long side, some on the short side. I've just noticed the longs counter attack around $11 and the shorts counter attack around $19. I've made 3 success swings off those enter and exit points and turn $150 in almost $500. I've started calling MVIS ol' faithful. Be warned, I think the longs will win and the stock will have a major break out at some point. Make sure your on the rocket not off of it when that happens."

2021-04-21 14:40:56,wallstreetbets,"If you believe the stock could go up during that time, sure. But what‚Äôs the catalyst? There is none for the time being and the chart looks pretty ugly. The MSFT news was good for a bounce but it‚Äôs clear bears are in control and the LIDAR landscape is more complicated than any long would care to admit. 

I‚Äôm just giving my $0.02 because I‚Äôve made this mistake before. It hurts to take losses. There is always the possibility that something could happen to reverse your losses. But at some point one has to make a real quantitative estimate about what those chances are and it‚Äôs in your best interest to be honest with yourself and not give in to your own biases or fallacies. It‚Äôs always easier to throw money into a current losing investment than a new unknown investment but this ‚Äúthrowing good money after bad‚Äù in most circumstances. You need a real fundamental thesis with sales and cost projections to be confident ‚Äúlowering your basis‚Äù when you‚Äôre in the middle of a 50% drawdown. 

Meanwhile you‚Äôre paying an opportunity cost for holding this while there are much better quality trades to be had with not only better risk but better return.

Buyout potential, 

Best in class solid state LIDAR and by best in class I mean all the companies saying they‚Äôre doing it too are all a year or three away from a working production prototype.  MVIS is way out in front here, and is already manufacturing critical components for other companies flagship hardware. 

Will Microsoft be happy to let another third party take control of the source of the LIDAR that makes Hololens work? 

Someone with double digit billions on the line is gonna buy this company, and we‚Äôre gonna make a bunch of money when they do.

If I‚Äôm wrong it won‚Äôt be the end of the world, but I‚Äôm a believer.  When MVIS is also the leading manufacturer of LIDAR for self driving cars it‚Äôs gonna be game on with Tesla, Ford, Mercedes, Microsoft and a handful of others arguing over who gets to take Mavis home with them."

2021-04-21 15:13:05,wallstreetbets,I agree the lidar industry is shaky currently. Nobody is truly making any money yet. But if you follow mvis there is a endless amount of evidence that they are prepping for big business very soon. Wether it's partnerships or a complete buy out. The share price will rise. What is happening right now across the sector is not natural and i'm sure lidar stocks will rise even without news or PR. Which mvis has plenty on the way including A-sample demo info this month alone. If this stock is still around in 9 months from now it will easily be in the 30s if it hasn't been purchased by then. OP will not lose money if he just holds until actual business is announced.

They already have a pretty big partner in MSFT but the demand for the tech just isn‚Äôt there, especially given the auto industry‚Äôs current stance on it which was initially a big part of the bull thesis. Wishing for share price to rise does not make it so and as frustrating as it is, things rarely work out as well as you seem to think they do. Especially after the kind of volatility and upward movement in stocks we‚Äôve seen recently. The share price will rise but it will also fall, you just hope it will do more of the former than the latter... but is that really reasonable to expect given the currently available information? I don‚Äôt think it is because there‚Äôs no information to suggest that... you just wish that that would happen. 

In a situations like this it‚Äôs usually best to liquidate some of your position and put that cash to work elsewhere. If the stock manages to break the downtrend, then you might be justified to try and capture some of that upside momentum. But catching a falling knife? Easy way to get hurt."

It's basically been in a perfect tight bull flag decline/consolidation the past month while equities broke out...

Whichever direction the 10 year breaks will likely result in a huge corresponding move in tech/growth and value stocks just like we saw in Feb-March.

We're likely to see another big rotation wave if the 10 year breaks out and attempts a run at 2+%.

Worth keeping an eye on imo since everything is correlated here.

Market Beta values across assets are the highest they've been since the 90s.  So all these things are going to move in concert..."

2021-04-21 07:07:13,wallstreetbets,"Futures are flat after a second straight day of losses for stock markets. Small caps are showing signs of life, up about 0.5%. That‚Äôs as of 0630. Yesterday the Russell 2000 dropped 2% and the Nasdaq almost 1%.

There was a very clear reversal in the reopening trade, with pandemic-sensitive names like travel companies seeing most of the selling, while stay-at-home stocks like Costco and Clorox benefited. 

One pandemic winner that didn‚Äôt go along for this ride was Netflix, which reported a slowdown in subscriber growth. NFLX is being punished, down to almost $500 per share. We did have earnings beats from Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble, and JNJ. 

PNG and Coke said they were raising prices, which means inflation is a-coming (or is already here). But then the bond market doesn‚Äôt really seem to care. Maybe it‚Äôs already priced in.

Bottom line: The pandemic fears have not been able to generate much staying power since last April. We‚Äôve seen this movie before and it always turns into a buying opportunity. Will this time be different? 

The macro elements that drive economies ‚Äî interest rates, employment, real estate ‚Äî are all pointing in the right direction. The Fed may be forced to act but we aren‚Äôt there yet. Big picture virus trends are pointing the right way too, at least in the U.S. and most developed markets.

Fear sells. Often people buy it. That‚Äôs where there are opportunities."

And if you type ‚ÄúVIX manipulation‚Äù into google you‚Äôll find that CBOE was sued for manipulation on their index. 

What did the judge rule? 

Well, they ruled that CBOE wasn‚Äôt purposefully manipulating anything. So they got off the hook. The judge didn‚Äôt say that the manipulation wasn‚Äôt happening, just that it wasn‚Äôt Cboe‚Äôs fault.

So, the Vix index, which inverses the entire market based on SPX options, can be easily manipulated. In other words, if you have enough money and time, you can manipulate the entire S and P.

2021-04-21 11:22:56,wallstreetbets,"AAPL, you useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you‚Äôre an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as a moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not you were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldritch abomination, but here you are. It‚Äôs hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel someday will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind‚Äôs greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowball's chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who‚Äôs soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not possess a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it. When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe. My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgement in light of the fact that when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless. There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact quite the opposite might be true. By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would exclusively be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in. But then again, you are so incredibly abominable that you would probably be able to surpass the worst conceivable failure a living being could possibly make. You are so incredibly pathetic that you are honestly not worthy of any more of my words nor my time. Just know that I will forever detest you for your failure and everything you stand for, and that no matter what happens, I will never ever forgive you.

2021-04-21 10:01:00,wallstreetbets,""" Expanding on these observations and discoveries, Dawkins wondered, when observing behaviours among humans, whether any similar process could be at work to explain why some ideas, which on the face of it seem injurious to those who hold them, continue to persist and proliferate. Devoting oneself to one‚Äôs art, impoverishing oneself in the pursuit of Truth, or welcoming martyrdom for one‚Äôs cause do not, it seems, represent behaviours which are obviously beneficial to the individual of for the spread of that individual‚Äôs genes. So, given that this kind of behaviour clearly exists, and is widespread, what is reaping the benefit? Dawkins‚Äô somewhat surprising answer was the ideas themselves. Ideas are clearly in competition with each other so perhaps there‚Äôs a selection process going on, analogous to natural selection, through which some ideas prove successful and spread whilst others die out. He concluded that there was such a selection process and, to emphasise the parallel to natural selection, he coined the term ‚Äúmeme‚Äù which come from an ancient Greek root, ‚Äúmimeme‚Äù, meaning imitated thing. Dawkins has also, perhaps a touch mischievously, referred to memes as ‚Äúmind viruses‚Äù, which has been met, predictably, with howls of indignation from some circles. The point he is trying to make is that memes, just like viruses, are indifferent to the welfare or otherwise of their hosts and the only thing that counts, from their perspective, is that they persist.

I don't think people calling a real estate bubble really fundamentally understand what caused the housing crisis.  It has little to do with valuation.  It was more to do with easy money.  We just aren't in that environment on the housing side.

I think value in the weed space will be in companies that are added value to weed. Companies that make new strains (Monsanto for example) or companies that transform weed plants into other products such as gummies but even this could be taken over by a major food or chemical manufacture.

There is basically no barrier to entry for new companies and absolutely no reason for large companies to buy up smaller companies, and there isn't even the concept of brands or trademarks with established value. The whole idea of a set of large publicly traded companies somehow capturing this market is laughable to me.

2021-04-21 13:57:40,wallstreetbets,"Before you crucify OP for this.. I will add that Schumer, Booker, and the Biden administration seem to be using the terms decriminalizing, descheduleing, and legalizing in very confusing ways.. Schumer explicitly said the two are interchangeablely but his reasoning had some merit... His stance seems to be more of a STATES Act and leave it up to the states which legally is probably the only way to do it... The terms they use might be a political thing so as to give Biden and others that oppose ""legalization"" (whatever that means) an ""out"" 

Back to Schumer's point, the FED gov typically doesn't legalize anything.. if it's not express in the Constitution it's up to the states, usually... the same way a few years ago that SCOTUS saying sports gambling isn't per se illegal didn't mean every state had to legalize sports betting (and most still don't)"

2021-04-21 19:34:26,wallstreetbets,">If anyone has ~~been a dispensary~~ **smoked weed** lately, this is a very real business.

Seriously, people love weed. The illicit cannabis market in California alone was worth almost [4 billion dollars](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurphy/2019/04/04/cannabis-black-market-problem/?sh=1c173aad134f) in just 2016. [Nearly 55 Million americans regularly consume it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/04/19/11-charts-that-show-marijuana-has-truly-gone-mainstream/), and its literally a federal crime to use it!

From anecdotal experience the people who are open to MJ but don't consume it don't for three principal reasons: 

1: it's illegal, they don't want to get in trouble

2: they don't know a person (dealer) who they trust that they can get it from

3: Many workplaces still prohibit use, even in state's where it is legal. 

&#x200B;

Legalizing recreational use of MJ completely solves 1 and 2. There is a huge untapped market of people who *like* weed but don't know where to get it and don't want to risk getting in some kind of trouble over it. With legal recreational dispensaries they don't have to worry about getting in trouble and they don't have to rely on some unreliable, possibly shady person who they don't know very well to get some possibly dogshit MJ. 

\#3 remains an issue but i think as more states legalize it the stigmas around MJ will disappear and the number of employers who care will eventually be vanishingly small.

We're well on our way to legalization in a supermajority of States and i think the time is fast approaching where the feds will at a minimum decriminalize. A legal MJ market has the potential to explode. I don't think it's at all too optimistic to predict that MJ could be as big as booze someday."

weed is REALLY easy to grow. when i was trimming my bosses would offer bulk to employees saying 'sell it to our friends back home' and i knew 5 people who had or were doing such. they basically cant move all the product in state fast enough and a lot of it goes out of state to places its not legal.

once a big company can step in and have grow ops the shitty markets will be secured making it hard for smaller business' to stay a float. those 1$ shake joints do add up and make a lot of money.

most people will be able to grow dank enough weed without fear but i do think there will be a like farmer market/medical stores but the current amount of store fronts will drop hard as a lot of them just act as fronts for the grow"

That means that, despite the huge tax variance, the actual product that is shipped to all 50 states is essentially the same. That won't be the case for weed. Each state has its own oversite rules for the final product and there is no expectation that a uniform set of federal regulations will supersede that.

Phillip Morris (Atria) has a plan for the 21st century, and that plan is the Juul platform. Now, there might be potential for that to incorporate a THC type delivery system too, so there IS money to be made here, but at best that keeps the company going.

2021-04-21 14:30:38,wallstreetbets,"To use your example, CO has a 2.9% tax on alcohol and marijuana. However, they have an extra tax on recreational marijuana of 15%. So a total of 17.9 (nearly 18%) tax on marijuana. 

If I can buy a few buds for $23.58 dollars at a store but only $20 from my dealer, it might not be worth going to the store. Every 6th purchase is free from a dealer at that point. If one smokes pretty regularly that could be a difference of a few hundred bucks over a year. That's a lot of extra doobies. 

Now, as for beer, yeah, I can brew my own, but I know it will take a lot of time and effort. Therefore, if I knew a guy who made his own beer in large quantities and I didn't have to pay any taxes on it like 18% (and I liked the beer), then I think I would probably just keep going to him instead of buying from a store. A 3% tax is still there, but negligible. 

I would liken it to drinking beer at a bar or restaurant (which comes with massive mark-ups and grossly bloated tips) or drinking at home. I personally would drink at home 99 times out of 100 strictly due to the cost difference."

2021-04-21 11:39:37,wallstreetbets,"that.... is a fundamental misunderstanding of the cannabis industry.  No pot company is making money selling straight pot anymore unless they are the wholesaler and even then the margins are razor razor thin like think less than 10%.  The money is being made in the marijuana derivative products like sodas, and accessories which is IP. 
 I dont disagree that there will be a lot of failed pot companies in 5-10 years but they will fail not because anyone can sell pot but because big corporations are already moving into the space.  STZ basically owns canopy and canopy is basically the largest player in the space right now.  IMO I bought a fuckton of STZ for a less risky exposure to marijuana on top of my risky individual pot stocks."

Also, if the business is run efficiently (trulieve, curaleaf, GTI, cresco among many examples) they can be very lucrative and make a lot of money. The companies that are not going to survive are the ones that just grow a bunch of weed thinking they‚Äôre going to sell it or the ones they grow a bunch of weed and then their customer finds plastic in it or mold.... yes it‚Äôs easy to grow and all that but look at alcohol or cigarettes, people can do that themselves too but there‚Äôs still markets for the majority that would still rather just go buy it. weed will be a CPG commodity with BRANDS ruling the market just like Budweiser, Marlboro, coke, Pepsi, etc etc."

If/when MJ is legalized you're gonna have Topo Chico and Pabst THC drinks and the weed is gonna be whatever appealing subbrand Altria created for a national campaign.

Think like vaporizers, edibles, glass, etc. You have an ip in that instance and in the case of vapes and glass, can be sold nationally and lead to brand recognition. Also the materials that grow them, like hydroponics, would benefit immensely, even if 50 states each had varying policies. 

In the long run, I could see the federal govt wanting to legalize so they can get their share of tax rev too."
2021-04-21 12:28:56,wallstreetbets,"There are already interstate pot companies. They're called multi-state operators. That's why the weed etf MSOS is called that.

If you're fighting for cents per share here and there, it won't make a big difference when you sell back. Unless you intend on buying now for dozens of thousands in which case I can understand."

Some states (I live in Massachusetts) have a small window to grow, and we are limited to a certain number of plants, but we all look forward to the product grown outside because it‚Äôs always superior.

2021-04-21 19:14:37,wallstreetbets,"""Cookies"", a cannabis brand, sells shitty weed (40% of the time) at a massive premium due to their branding. $60/3.5g while others get on average $20-$40. It adds up quickly. 

Regardless how bad pricing dropped in my state due to oversaturation, branding and quality is what got a premium price. 

Sweetwater branding also matters considering they've been building a customer base for decades, all centered on marijuana culture. Those same people who enjoy buying their ""420 Pale Ale"" or strain specific brews, will absolutely be trying the real THC version once it's available. So that branding, and customer loyalty, matters there as well.

Also, having invested in branding behind a drink, Aphria has a solid defense against the black market. Unless you're dealer is planning on starting a brewery in his basement and making water soluble THC. ü§∑. Also, customers like choices. Eventually the weed guy always disappoints, and people are gonna eventually cave in to the convenience of a store. 

Also, Uber will willing to drop it on your doorstep for you. So, there's that. None of the ""be there in 10"" bullshit. You'll know when your weed is picked up and when it will be there, along with the taco bell you ordered. Black market is just a few regulations away from being fukd.

It's great for lots of other things though."
2021-04-21 13:15:08,wallstreetbets,"You're hoping for something that just isn't possible because of how differently they work. NSAIDs and acetaminophen interfere with inflammatory pathways and such, THC doesn't. THC, like opioids, basically just make you high enough that they pain isn't an issue (amongst other things). You can already get THC is low doses, but it's still an intoxicant because that's how it acts in the body. You're looking for a whole new substance, which is highly unlikely to be a cannabis product based on current knowledge."
2021-04-21 16:34:47,wallstreetbets,"Very true. But I had missed where they mentioned operating heavy machinery at first. I just don‚Äôt see a way that will ever happen with cannabis, unless we removed the THC completely and isolate some other compound that works for pain with no intoxicating effect. Federal legalization will lead to FDA approval for capsules, I‚Äôm sure, but it won‚Äôt change the intoxicating aspect anytime soon."
2021-04-21 11:39:43,wallstreetbets,I would think that would give one of the states an incentive to adjust their policies if they don‚Äôt want to give up that lost revenue to the other state.

2021-04-21 12:32:39,wallstreetbets,"I mean, there is potential there, but honestly those markets have always existed. One thing we have learned in the states that legalize is that consumption doesn't really go up all that much. People will continue to buy and there is money to be made, but its not going to be some financial explosion on federal legalization day."
2021-04-21 12:30:52,wallstreetbets,"Right, the difference is that Alcohol and Tobacco sell a uniform product to all 50 states. The only difference is taxation and distribution. Each state has different requirements for weed as far as testing and production rules. The fact that some companies EXIST that sell to more than one states does not mean that one of them is going to become the new Phillip Morris."

2021-04-21 08:20:43,wallstreetbets,I haven't paid full price for weed since I got my medical card. These fools in restricted states just don't know the luxury of legal weed.
2021-04-21 08:25:21,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm telling you that right now in MA, a fucking 1/8 at any dispensary costs $55 minimum.  That‚Äôs insane.  Meanwhile I can get the literal same quality, from a grower I know, for $30 or less.  And here, there are no discounts with quantity in the legal weed world.

I‚Äôm not retarded, and I don‚Äôt recall insulting you.  But the fact is that in MA, not CO, not OR, not CA, because I can‚Äôt testify to those situations, legal weed is far more expensive still than buying direct."
2021-04-21 17:39:10,wallstreetbets,"WHAT COMPETITION YOU APE??? 

How many other brands do they sell in their stores that are not their own? How many other dispensaries exist in the state that aren't TL? Yawn. 

They exist inside a tightly controlled ""good ole boys club"" at the moment. Unfortunately, that country club is about to become the YMCA in the switch from medical to Recreational.

2021-04-21 15:14:43,wallstreetbets,That has nothing to do with what I said. They said might as well be another big tobacco; as if big tobacco itself wasn't going to be in the mix.
2021-04-21 15:35:03,wallstreetbets,Yep. So I'll avoid any weed from cigarette manufacturers who are known for questionable practices 80 years in the making.
2021-04-21 17:14:51,wallstreetbets,https://www.bcc.ca.gov/
2021-04-21 12:04:45,wallstreetbets,ok.  well that's literally what all my comments were geared to.
2021-04-21 13:01:57,wallstreetbets,"still not gonna be profitable commercially.  it's like making solar wafers, increased capacity and supply glut causes constantly eroding margins.  have to spend your way out of it to compete as a major player.  before you know it the company is over leveraged and drowning in debt.  people like you love to look at ""all the weed buyers"".  cool, doesn't change the economics of the stock.

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4414472-aurora-cannabis-dilution-nightmare-lives-on](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4414472-aurora-cannabis-dilution-nightmare-lives-on)

Canada's been legal for a while and the only producers doing okay, are those paired with partners, primarily in beverage.  that way their losses are subsidized because it's easier to markup as a small scale add-in where the markup is invisible to the end consumer.  otherwise, competing on the open market just isn't as profitable as folks want to believe."
2021-04-21 08:25:56,wallstreetbets,"MA is not a restricted state, we have full legality"
2021-04-21 08:33:35,wallstreetbets,"Man you gotta get real. You do not buy an 1/8th for 30. Anyone selling you that is either your very good friend (and isn't useful for comparing to real prices) or is selling you shit and calling it fire. 240/OZ  is reasonable. No one straight prices though so comparing 1/8 when buying an Oz and 1/8 straight is not apples to apples. 

https://www.cultivatemass.com/locations/framingham/menu?dtche%5Bcategory%5D=flower

First result, zero price shopping. That is 35 an 1/8th for straight fire when you buy an O. 

Despite what you believe, they are not the same quality either. Go compare. Ask your grower for a strain a dispensary carries. Look at them. Compare them.

Does your grower even grow legal quality? Ever ask him how it works? They sell the biggest best buds to dispensaries, the shake and little buds go to the dealers. It is how they maintain their higher **tested** values of THC.

Regardless, it is at best a wash, and like I said, you still get oodles of other stuff at a dispensary without breaking the law."
2021-04-21 11:20:38,wallstreetbets,"Thank god they figured it out in CO then, because I‚Äôm paying $75 an ounce.

So, they don‚Äôt have it figured out in your area, that sucks but the fact of the matter is that it can be done properly."
2021-04-21 18:37:05,wallstreetbets,"Like I said already, in Florida dispensaries have to control the whole vertical operation. There are a ton of other dispensaries too, all growing and producing their own product. That is the competition. 

Trulieve is a producer as well as a retailer, and I can tell you the top end of their product is some of the best I‚Äôve ever seen. 

It isn‚Äôt as easy as you think to grow the highest quality stuff, when it goes legal the companies that already specialize in it will have a leg up. 

Also Trulieve operates in many states."
2021-04-21 17:42:38,wallstreetbets,Ya and what‚Äôs there general rate of enforcement on testing centers? That means nothing
2021-04-21 15:29:54,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, growing weed is 10x easier than brewing beer and yet there are thousands of profitable breweries everywhere now.  I have faith the commercial weed industry will figure it out."
2021-04-21 08:52:45,wallstreetbets,"$200/oz in Texas from my guy.  $70/quarter.

It all comes from CO though, lmao."
2021-04-21 09:12:03,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs medical pricing, which is discounted vs retail"
2021-04-21 18:45:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, so there's not a lot of in store competition due to the whole vertical integration thing, right? 

Also, I wouldn't say there's ""ton of other dispensaries"" when easily researchable market information says over 80% of FL's market is comprised of 5 companies. So not really a ""ton."" 

What little competition exists now, will be 10x very soon for them. Not only be 10x the stores to compete with, but they will have to sell other brands within their store. Both of those facts are going to deduct straight from their bottom line. 

And ""the best you've seen"" isn't much when your market is essentially an oligarchy. Here where **I** shop (and work) each store carries well over 50-75 different brands, and there's at least 3 stores in each unique ""area"" of a city. That's massive amounts of competition for shelf space and customers. 

There's nothing that's been specialized about growing good weed in Florida. Lol I'm sorry but Florida has **never** been known for good weed. When west coast companies alone are allowed to enter FL, you can start to compare quality. 

You can't know much about weed when you're in one of the most restrictive medical markets in the US. It's like someone wanting to be the fancy wine experts at restaurants but they have only ever had a handful of different wines. Smh."
2021-04-21 15:31:39,wallstreetbets,"> there are thousands of profitable breweries everywhere now

total fallacy.  many are hemorrhaging due to over-competition.  one of my good buddies was gonna start one and one of the local ""successful"" brewers was willing to lease out time on their equipment to help cover costs because they're too high and losing money."
2021-04-21 18:55:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah a ton was the wrong word, there are a few, and zero in store competition, although they do have sub branded weed from their various grow ops. 

I‚Äôve been to Cali, Seattle, Colorado, Amsterdam, Detroit, and Alaska, and I‚Äôve been in this game a long time before any of those places had dispensaries too. Questioning my weed expertise really isn‚Äôt the path to go here. 

When I moved to Florida and discovered Trulieve I was surprised to find higher quality bud than any of the above places.  Granted I know the high quality stuff is out there, I just couldn‚Äôt find it super easily in my relatively short visits to those places.  Never the less, I know for a fact that Trulieve hangs with the best of them. Growing in Florida isn‚Äôt the secret, they‚Äôve simply got the process down to a science and have great strains to work with."
2021-04-21 19:02:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but unless it's real experience in a legal/recreational industry, what does your ""expertise"" walking into a dispensary mean? 

I've done legal marijuana sales for 5 years and I bet I walk into more dispensaries daily than you have in the last year. So I will question you. Lol 

I'm sorry, but like I said earlier, due to where you live your opinion doesn't mean much. It's a monoplized market where you see very little options. You seem to be very pro-Trulieve, so I doubt you shop around often. 

A legal market puts those other choices in front of your face. Trulieve is obviously going to have less of an incentive to stock a ton of different brands, right? They want their brands to dominate in store sales, obviously. However the other store down the road with no in house brands instead carries over 100 different brands. Customers like choices and Trulieve is going to lose a lot of customers to new stores and will be losing in store customers to sales to other brands. Very very rough road ahead for them with a LOT to prove.


Edit: versus where they stand today, someone coming in their store and buying another companies product means they make less money on that transaction than where they stand today selling only their own product. Also, don't you think a LOT of people who continue to go to Trulieve stores will want to try the new brands? Not good for them."
2021-04-21 19:21:41,wallstreetbets,You really don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. There‚Äôs plenty of people bringing high end Cali stuff out here and to Atlanta every day. Your whole argument is that in my 20 years of smoking I‚Äôve never seen the highest end weed before? That‚Äôs a dumb argument buddy.
2021-04-21 19:41:17,wallstreetbets,"Lol, you're right. You're a super expert because your buddy grows good weed. 

I'm done here. lol you have opinions, but no insight at all. Sorry to be frank, but I don't care about your feelings."

2021-04-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Nintendo - underrated Value? (sorry for bad English, I'm from Germany) In this post, I want to discuss the hidden values of Nintendo.

1. We start with a short fundamental analysis

\-Nintendo has liabilities of round about 32,5$ per share

\-on the other hand there are 119,5$ equity

that means we have 87$ assets per share (we can subtract this amount for the further analysis, because this value is available in assets)

one share cost round about 580$ - 87$(in assets) we get a price of 493$

If we use the predicted earnings for next year, we've got a PE-ratio of 15,5.

That's a normal PE-ratio for a Japanese Share, but what are the hidden values of Nintendo (in my opinion)?

As many of us, I was watching YouTube Videos in the Corona-Time. And I got addicted to Pokemon Booster openings. In this context I realized, that my generation, has a big emotional bond to Nintendo products. Nintendo still hold's the license for popular franchises like Pokemon and Mario Kart. The amounts of money, that flew, just for very old products of this franchise, give u a roughly estimate, of how big, the value actually is.

Pls use the commentary function to change my mind :)"

2021-04-21 02:10:49,wallstreetbets,"Nintendo is 100% the next disney.

Guarantee you more kids know Mario than Mickey Mouse. Mario may be the most popular and well known IP in the world.

Combine this with theme parks, a possible foray into movie content etc, and of course endless endless merchandising. Nintendo empire will be around for the next 200 years. Contrary to what 12 year old me said on the gamefaqs forums all those years ago: ninteNdo is teh do0med!!!"
2021-04-21 02:01:11,wallstreetbets,"I can't speak much on the action of their stocks but they have a tendency of being very complacent when they're doing well. The second half of the Wii's lifecycle was a nightmare and they followed it up with the Wii U, which was a complete failure. The Switch has been on a hot streak but they've massively slowed down on major releases. You'll certainly see an uptick when BotW2 releases but unfortunately they're a rather stubborn and traditional in their approach to video games. I'd jump on Sony tbh because of the chip shortages, PS5 being difficult to obtain and they seem to be only getting warmed up.

EDIT: And to note, Sony previously broke a record for most profitable quarter. Their next earning date is 4/28 so this week is a great time to jump in."
2021-04-21 01:40:28,wallstreetbets,Love nintendo. Always have. Always will.

2021-04-21 09:48:17,wallstreetbets,Nintendo has been around for a very long time. The company started by making playing cards in the 1880's and many generation before us had emotional bonds with the company and as for the future generations.
2021-04-21 11:31:25,wallstreetbets,Nintendo is heavy in ARK ETFs last I checked - it's no hidden gem.
2021-04-21 18:05:05,wallstreetbets,Apparently we should be sending people to Germany to learn English.
2021-04-21 06:13:25,wallstreetbets,Nintendo sadly don‚Äôt have options but I got them easily hitting 90+ in next January. This year is about to be a record breaking year for them if chip shortage don‚Äôt affect them imo
2021-04-21 01:49:53,wallstreetbets,"Everything is a bit messed up with the covaid thing, but they may be overvalued. Yes, nintendo is the king and queen of handheld, but recycling an owned franchise can only go so far. Maybe hold for short term ""new"" game releases,  longer term on new platform development and expectation of public ""feels"". Stable, but not for quick gains.

Not financial advise from this smooth brained ape."
2021-04-21 09:45:27,wallstreetbets,"Nintendo is a huge play over the next few years. They are adding a switch pro to the line of products this year that will be 4k and use DLSS and it will crush the other consoles, which they are already doing anyways.

2021-04-21 12:15:18,wallstreetbets,"Dont forget, Pokemon alone is ALREADY the largest/ most profitable media franchise in history, and ahead of Mickey, Marvel, Star wars etc."
2021-04-21 15:38:13,wallstreetbets,"Ever since Sony moved out of Japan, they're basically nonexistent in japan. They Axed a 20 year old studio there, as they'll focus on AAA blockbuster games (risky, as they're expensive. if one goes bust, shit'll hit the fan). As a result nintendo skyrocekted in japan.

take it as you must I'm not invested in either of them and probably wont be directly."

2021-04-21 10:50:50,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but the misconception that Pokemon = Nintendo is so common that it can boost Nintendo stock regardless. E.g. Nintendo stock spiked when Pokemon Go launched, even though Nintendo had nothing to do with the game and wasn't even getting revenue from it."
2021-04-21 09:31:06,wallstreetbets,"So I've had to do some reading on this every couple years because it's confusing, it does seem they own a large or majority stake in the Pok√©mon company as well. And they also hold the rights to all of the Pok√©mon. So if magically a company were to be able make a Pok√©mon game, movie, or whatever, they could not use any of the existing Pok√©mon without Nintendo. Could be wrong, so feel free to chime in if my research is wrong."
2021-04-21 16:40:27,wallstreetbets,"There are a lot of misconceptions about this, but Nintendo did found/ owns the Pokemon company and DOES hold its licenses alongside Gamefreak/ Creatures. Its worth mentioning that all Gamefreak and Creatures do is basically develop games for Nintendo, and that Nintendo also has stakes in them as separate entities."

2021-04-21 09:59:58,wallstreetbets,"100%? Absolutely not. Mario as an ip has been far more used in better ways than mickey mouse has been. What was the last major mickey mouse project? Mario is used multiple times per year in different manners to hit a larger audience. At one point, yes Mickey was more well known. That time has passed, at least for now"
2021-04-21 12:11:08,wallstreetbets,Even 10 years ago Mario was rated as more recognizable than Mickey.
2021-04-21 13:27:46,wallstreetbets,"In 1990, a national survey found that Mario was more recognizable to American children than Mickey Mouse.

2021-04-21 13:00:59,wallstreetbets,"Im not so sure that is true outside of the west. Take hello kitty for example, way more popular with kids in the east, that it has long surpassed both Mario, and Mickey. Most kids don‚Äôt get that exposure to hello kitty in the west though."
2021-04-21 15:25:49,wallstreetbets,"maybe 90's kids, where the fuck has mickey mouse been the past 20 years ? I mean, i cant remember mickey anything in recent history.

2021-04-21 09:23:24,wallstreetbets,"It's primarily a European thing, with some African countries also following the minority of people who use decimal commas. Asia is primarily in decimal point gang, as well as the Americas, australia, and most English speaking countries."
2021-04-21 13:26:05,wallstreetbets,"Mexico, Caribbean, and South American countries use decimal  

It's mostly Europe that uses commas"

2021-04-21 10:01:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm not saying Mario as an IP has been used more, which certainly could be the case. I'm saying Mickey Mouse is still more known than Mario."

2021-04-21 15:14:04,wallstreetbets,1990 was like a hundred years ago.
2021-04-21 12:32:16,wallstreetbets,"Why not go long?  They're getting into the theme park industry and (I think) expanding into movies as well.

They have their strong opinions on how best to sell/release/re-release their own software, but they seem to be ambitious with their IP even outside of games."
2021-04-21 17:16:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but realistically, at a basic level, any earnings Gamefreak and Creatures get from the Pokemon Company is spent on R and D for Nintendo."
2021-04-21 04:52:45,wallstreetbets,"Actually most of the world uses the comma to separate decimals, while only english speaking countries for the most part use the dot. When using comma for decimals, to separate the hundreds from the thousands it‚Äôs either dots, in many parts of europe, or just spaces, like 1 420 696,69 ‚Ç¨ . Driving on the left side of the road is weird anywhere but in the UK and its colonies, while the term biscuits is much older than cookies because it has latin roots dating back to the X century. Italy and France for example call cookies ‚Äúbiscotti‚Äù and ‚Äúbiscuits‚Äù respectively, and it carried over to UK english."

2021-04-21 13:04:32,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs cuz Mario isn‚Äôt controversial.  He‚Äôs the best, most resilient stereotype ever created"
2021-04-21 19:45:44,wallstreetbets,"I remember a super [mario bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._(film)) live action movie, but none from mickey."
2021-04-21 10:14:02,wallstreetbets,"Trust me as a ape raising apes... Mickey/Minnie Mouse are more widely known by tiny apes. They are introduced to the house of mouse at a way younger age than Mario. Nintendo would need to start producing original content TV shows for toddlers for Mario to even be considered in this discussion.

Mother fucking Anna and Elsa are more well known by kids than Mario."
2021-04-21 17:23:20,wallstreetbets,"Ok, and there are what, 3 active, maybe 4. While not its own park, Mario is teamed up with universal to create large attractions as well. What else mickey mouse, not Disney, has come out over the past few years? Mario is used in multiple ways per year.

It's too bad theres no definitive way to answer this."
2021-04-21 18:11:54,wallstreetbets,They also have stupid cash reserves. Nintendo is a brand I literally cannot fathom great-great-grandkids not knowing.
2021-04-21 05:22:53,wallstreetbets,"Just cause noone asked, the reason Englishfolk drive on the left of the road, dates back to the middle ages. A right handed Knight on the left-side of the road has better full use of his sword."
2021-04-21 05:43:44,wallstreetbets,"Also, biscuits derives from the production method of biscuits.
Since biscuits are cooked twice.
Biscotti in Italian (bis= twice, cotti= cooked)
Biscuit in French (bis= twice, cuit= cooked)"
2021-04-21 14:09:14,wallstreetbets,"Weird. Instead of the term ""decimal point"", do you say ""decimal small curved slash"" or something different?"
2021-04-21 15:11:33,wallstreetbets,"Yes but ""cookie"" in German is ""Kekse"".  Anyway, nice little upward price channel on NTDOY.  Price target $77"
2021-04-21 08:40:55,wallstreetbets,So the important things
2021-04-21 12:38:52,wallstreetbets,speak for yourself.....I'm not shooting no commie cartridge sizes.
2021-04-21 12:59:35,wallstreetbets,1/8th oz and .223‚Äù still going strong
2021-04-21 11:54:38,wallstreetbets,What about Pikachu?
2021-04-21 11:06:50,wallstreetbets,"Mickey an Minne mouse are in what? Have they even been used in the last 20 years?

Elsa sure, Elsa can't last forever
Mario is 40 years old now, and still the forefront of its companies brand.

I bet Captain America is more popular with kids then mickey mouse at this point."
2021-04-21 10:53:02,wallstreetbets,I think they tried a super Mario bros children‚Äôs cartoon in the 80s and it was... okay. I think it‚Äôd be hard for them to compete at the level of Disney
2021-04-21 15:27:45,wallstreetbets,"This is in america only man, outside of the place where disneyland actually exists mickey hasnt been on brand for.... the past 20 yrs. 

Name me a single mickey thing thats happened in the 00's."
2021-04-21 16:06:04,wallstreetbets,"+1

Disney positions Disney Junior as educational and Junior revolves around Mickey.

Hard to envision Mario heading in that direction to compete at the toddler age bracket"
2021-04-21 17:51:24,wallstreetbets,"Disney Junior revolves around Mickey. They‚Äôre 2 different age brackets, and Disney gets them when they‚Äôre young. Disney IP portfolio is deep, and you‚Äôre right, Disney doesn‚Äôt need to use Mickey multiple times per year because they prefer developing other franchises.

A Mickey short precedes every Disney Animation Studio. Mickey merch. You draw 3 circles and people the world over know what you‚Äôre talking about.

What about under-developed countries? For many, Disney/Mickey is iconic American.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like Mario, but to say Mario has bigger awareness than Mickey is misguided.

2021-04-21 14:25:54,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not a native speaker so I‚Äôm not even sure in what context you‚Äôd use decimal point, however in general you just say ‚Äúdecimals after the comma‚Äù, and you just replace the word ‚Äúpoint‚Äù with ‚Äúcomma‚Äù. For example 12,40 is twelve comma forty . You just have to think about it this way, where you use commas we use points, and where you use the point we use a comma. Up until recently I never had to deal with USD so when I found out you guys were doing the opposite (using point instead of commas and vice versa) the first times I had to place orders I was so scared of fucking it up and sending a giant order by mistake so I had to double check every time. It‚Äôs just one of those things that the whole civilized world needs to sit down and decide on a standard, but it won‚Äôt happen because there‚Äôs boomers who‚Äôll never get used to it."

2021-04-21 12:10:42,wallstreetbets,"Compared to Pokemon as a franchise though, Mickey has long been losing regardless...also, google trends data isn‚Äôt going to account for much of the asian audience."
2021-04-21 12:45:21,wallstreetbets,"This is just incorrect.

Mickey has had quite a few legitimately good games. Not even counting Kingdom Hearts.

 Mario has had two short-lived cartoons and a bad movie (even though I like the movie, it's still bad).

I'm on team Nintendo here, but come on man."
2021-04-21 11:50:24,wallstreetbets,"The live-action elements, absolutely not. The cartoon parts though weren‚Äôt totally bad though. Still, even the best Mario cartoon spots don‚Äôt hold a candle to Disney‚Äôs empire"
2021-04-21 15:58:17,wallstreetbets,"lol no idea for real the reference you are making here, more american stuff ?"
2021-04-21 12:13:04,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, but the brand of Disney is likely more popular especially with them owning Marvel which is a massive hit."
2021-04-21 15:35:47,wallstreetbets,Too bad Nintendo doesn‚Äôt own Pok√©mon
2021-04-21 13:19:53,wallstreetbets,Those games don‚Äôt really compete at all with Mario sales though.
2021-04-21 16:00:26,wallstreetbets,Haha wtf you doing conversing about an American company then?
2021-04-21 12:27:42,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, for sure Disney own a-lot more popular IPs as a company than Nintendo, Nintendo just happens to own Pokemon which is the most popular in history. Surprisingly though, Mario as a media franchise has actually raked in a similar amount to Marvel. But Disney still have Star wars, Winnie the Pooh etc."
2021-04-21 15:39:26,wallstreetbets,"What are you talking about? The entire Pokemon company is literally a joint venture founded/ owned by Nintendo, Gamefreak, and Creatures"
2021-04-21 15:15:19,wallstreetbets,"Sales aren't everything.  


Mario is, in my opinion, the best pure platformer series. Not too difficult, not super easy, lots of room to master them.  


But Mickey's better games (mostly the older platformers) are excellent games, worth playing, worth buying."
2021-04-21 16:01:40,wallstreetbets,"No, i know the references to the people but what have they got to do with mickey mouse ? Topic is mickey as a character, not disney."
2021-04-21 18:04:01,wallstreetbets,I stand corrected.  I thought it was mostly owned mostly by Game Freak.  But it looks like they share ownership.  Nintendo owns 32% of Pok√©mon
2021-04-21 15:35:57,wallstreetbets,"I very much enjoyed, and still own my copy of Mickey‚Äôs Wild adventure on PS1, and have played the first 2 Kingdom Hearts games. Its all just personal opinion though. Most of the world are casual gamers, and would not enjoy playing something like Kingdom hearts or a Mickey platformer as much as Mario. Sales clearly reflect this. Mario is also clearly more popular as a gaming character, no question."
2021-04-21 16:05:24,wallstreetbets,"They were all part of the Mickey Mouse Club...how Mickey do you want it?

Disney as a company can make Mickey as relevant as they want to at any given moment."
2021-04-21 18:27:02,wallstreetbets,"Bare in mind also, that Gamefreak and Creatures do very little outside of development for Nintendo, and the majority of earnings (Pokemon company, or elsewhere) will be going towards that."
2021-04-21 16:07:16,wallstreetbets,"heh i dont think you guys know how isolated mickey mouse club, that house of mouse show i saw someone mention is to america, im 40 dude, i have never heard of that show and only vague references to that club here in australia.."
2021-04-21 16:13:12,wallstreetbets,"But you‚Äôve heard of Ryan Gosling and those 3 singers haven‚Äôt you? Disney‚Äôs influence is on another level and mentioning Nintendo in the same breath is laughable. It all starts with Mickey, don‚Äôt fuck with the mouse üòÇ"
2021-04-21 16:16:10,wallstreetbets,"im not doubting, but the whole conversation was about the who is more recognized in the current generation and at least here in australia mario is easily more recognized.

There is no micky merch, no shows, no cartoons, no disney anything here other than elsa/frozen. My kids wouldnt know dick all about mickey mouse but they will tell you all about mario."
2021-04-21 16:30:52,wallstreetbets,"Well you invest in Mario then, the smart money is on Mickey üòõ"

2021-04-21 14:25:05,wallstreetbets,I remember buying into MVIS back in its penny days. Good stuff... only that I bought at the worst possible time and sold at an equally bad time. Glad to see things worked out for others -- now where's my gun?
2021-04-21 12:00:11,wallstreetbets,And they thought I was a wild boy for moving $7k into MVIS last year

2021-04-21 02:56:10,wallstreetbets,I accidentally clicked on a CLOV post when I went to come here originally. I got so scared for my MVIS calls reading the comments. This feels better.
2021-04-21 08:31:25,wallstreetbets,this is what i like to see
2021-04-21 10:26:25,wallstreetbets,I was hoping for one more day of bleeding. Switched to etrade and funds don't clear for trading until tomorrow.

But this whole play for me is high risk high reward. Considering I‚Äôm playing it for the buyout, I do not want a cap on my potential. So I‚Äôm riding out. That premium is very tempting though."

2021-04-21 19:01:47,wallstreetbets,Yep I only had 5k deposited. That'd would have been a juicy gain with 800ish shares in low 10s
2021-04-21 17:44:04,wallstreetbets,It's an investing sub at its base though so why should we ignore basic fundamentals? Don't know why this sub is so against talking about stock valuations.
2021-04-21 04:04:21,wallstreetbets,ü§£ dunno why but that old fashioned insult was just a perfect response
2021-04-21 03:29:55,wallstreetbets,Fr. I've been lurkin this sub trying to learn about trading since the guy drank his own pee and mr beast ask for stock valuations. These past months have been hard because of people like him/her

2021-04-21 12:39:37,wallstreetbets,And yes I agree GME isn‚Äôt the only stock out there. Just the only one I‚Äôve done enough research on currently.
2021-04-21 12:06:55,wallstreetbets,I'm just glad I snagged 150 shares and 3 calls early

I would like to hold this til at least the end of the year, but if we see a quick run-up to $45-$50 prior to earnings, it's going to be hard not to sell at least a chunk.  Otherwise, I'll continue to sell some covered calls and wait for the stock to get to $60 by EoY."

2021-04-21 14:01:32,wallstreetbets,Factset shows private equity owns nearly 66% of shares. They have been selling every time it gets into mid 30s. There is a lot of supply to go through before the stock makes a run. Hopefully earnings can get it some attention and big mutual funds and etfs scoop up a boatload of shares from the private equity who is selling.
2021-04-21 00:34:24,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll reach 50+ end of year nooo problem

Until then though I've been selling CCs and steadily reduced my cost basis over the past 6 months.  If you think CRSR will one day spike back up, you don't want to do it.  But if you think CRSR will be a steady return up, think about selling the monthly CCs."

2021-04-21 08:35:56,wallstreetbets,If you‚Äôve been around this is always how it is.  When the market is hot  everyone is having a ball.  When we cool off a little it feels like we are attending a funeral unless you‚Äôre buying puts.
2021-04-21 11:49:31,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs more of a long term play. Profitable company with increasing margins. Don‚Äôt mind holding till year end. Interesting to see Q1 results on the 4th.
2021-04-21 14:37:18,wallstreetbets,It moves to the right
2021-04-21 11:23:58,wallstreetbets,Those will still print.  Would probably behoove you to average down though.

While this analyst stuff doesn't always matter on companies that have a long history, on an recent IPO like this, I tend to think it has more of an effect. Maybe not the analyst's ratings, but the fact that CRSR has good fundamentals and is prepping for growth, aquiring new companies etc."

2021-04-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BB is the underdog, no question. **Ok, fellow Apes I admit.** I have been holding the blackberry bag since 20 bucks; but I am still faithful. I am faithful because blackberry is the underdog that wall street has casted aside (and given the fact that a loss is only a loss if you sale!) and berated BB as a profitless tech co. and has soured their legitimacy. It is deeply undervalued for reasons unbeknownst to anyone.

It is leading the tech industry in 5G in South [Asia](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/blackberry-will-power-baidu-technology-for-future-chinese-evs/); BB has partnerships with tech giants like Baidu--- securing a contract to run Baidu's mapping tech on their infrastructure for autonomous vehicles -- a partnership that will pay dividends as that market is only projected to grow in the future. I ask again why do Boomers hate BB? I don't fucking know.

Not to mention, BB has a very respected and competent CEO who in my opinion is being [overpaid](https://financialpost.com/investing/blackberry-ceo-chen-gets-128-million-award-to-continue-revival), but has the potential to bring the stock to 30.00 by the end of this year.  He has a proven track [record](https://www.canadianbusiness.com/leadership/blackberry-ceo-john-chen-turnaround-interview/).

oh, and by the way, BB is not a fucking smart phone company. At least not anymore. Maybe this is why they are not respected? That's a bullshit cop out; there's real money to be made with BB if we give it the proper evaluation. This [ape](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l0ujm0/is_blackberry_bb_actually_undervalued/) was absolutely correct.  BB is a tech co. that develops secured communication systems, cyber security infrastructure, and works to secure these systems through AI.    It is deeply undervalued and is a underdog.

**Lets give BB a hand.**

BB's debt to equity ratio (47.9%) is considered high.

[Shareholders have been diluted in the past year](https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/software/tsx-bb/blackberry-shares#ownership_summary)

There's literally nothing in this post that suggests its undervalued - partnering with Baidu on a tiny autonomous car project (which could go nowhere - seems to be significantly lagging behind major rival Waymo atm - Waymo has had robotaxis on the road since 2018, with increasing geographic area and river numbers, and actual **driverless** robotaxis. Baidu has only had approval since 2020, and doesn't have driverless taxis on the road.

BB also **isn't** a 5G company? It doesn't dominate the 5G industry in Asia at all. Baidu is a chinese company, 5G is rolled out by other chinese state owned telecoms. Presumably the equipment is from Huawei.

BB does a lot of work with IoT, but it's honestly not some domineering market leader in this field. It has cybersecurity products - but again, it's no market leader.

A comparable company making security products in the same exact category (IoT, event management, UEM) is Cisco. Cisco trades at 4.67 P/S vs BBs 5.42 P/S.

BB revenue and profit is dropping, not to mention stripping and selling away assets will reduce licensing revenue (big revenue driver for BB), for short term capital.

The one unique brightspot in BBs product porfolio is QNX Neutrino, but you're expecting too benefit from it imo. Total BB revenue from software/services (like QNX) for 2020 was less than $700mn - total number of cars that use QNX is 175mn - therefore the **most** money BB can make from QNX per car is less than $4 per year.

Automotive OS market size is expected to around 4.5 bn globally in 2026- not a huge market. Not to mention QNX may be the biggest player, but it's not like Windows and desktop OS - QNX is looking at more like 30-40% of that market **if** no big tech companies like Google/Microsoft or car companies like VW (who are developing their own OS)  decide to muscle in.

At best, BB is a very long term play - like 5-10 years. But don't forget the share price is double what it was in April 2020, and like 30% up from pre-january spike prices. Saying it's undervalued is a big big stretch, and linking random articles won't mean it'll spike. It's **definitely** not going to spike to $30 a share within this year."

Similar companies like Ericsson have faced similar circumstances and have managed to weather the storm with more resilience. I think this will really hinder market sentiment outside of WSB and it's difficult to know if it will ever be able to shake it.

2021-04-21 07:32:37,wallstreetbets,WSB talks about Debt to Equity? Insane times
2021-04-21 08:35:06,wallstreetbets,"Depends on the sector. For a software company a 1.0 D/E is high, equity should be pretty huge from a vast number of intangible assets like patents, software, goodwill etc, which cost very little to maintain so shouldn't require a lot debt like a manufacturer would.

Additionally, you don't really want a increasing debt pile / decreasing assets if revenue/profit is declining."
2021-04-21 06:29:47,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry QNX being sold to Baidu is included in that revenue figure as that deal was announced in 2018, the new mapping tech was announced last quarter so if revenue is recognised in that quarter then it'll come up in Q1 earnings."

2021-04-20 22:03:09,wallstreetbets,If you‚Äôre expecting a big 10% or greater move in the stock then this type of OTM contract can actually be the most profitable contract in the option chain but holding for longer than a week is what you shouldn‚Äôt do with these.  You need a quick spike for these and then get out

2021-04-21 12:50:45,wallstreetbets,"I see. So if those 30c go up a bit he will cash out? That kind of makes sense but for the amount of money he spent it still would've been a much better play if these were ITM, ATM, or near the money. Good luck, OP"

2021-04-20 21:27:48,wallstreetbets,Just report your net gain/loss like all the cool kids do. Pay for TurboTax and it'll guide you through it.
2021-04-20 21:29:48,wallstreetbets,"Treat your gains as wages basically. And you can count your loss against your income. If you were net negative trading you can subtract that from your taxable income (like when you donate $$) if you were net positive you add that as income.
Edit: you can message me and I‚Äôll explain it better if you would like.
Sincerely,
Biscuit"
2021-04-20 23:33:23,wallstreetbets,"To all the retards who didn't bother parsing the 4 million words of US tax law: inform yourself about Wash Sale. 

If you realize your losses on a security and within 30 days (before and after) buy back into that same security or a highly similar one, then your losses are no longer deductible. 

This is how people majorly fuck themselves and end up with tax bills larger than their gains. They keep swing trading the same stock, periodically taking losses on it, and assume that the losses will count against the gains except they don't because of wash sale. 

There's other important info about capital gain taxation like long term vs short term but wash sale is the one I'd worry about if had a retarded step child playing the market."
2021-04-20 21:37:35,wallstreetbets,"I don't want to scare op, but wasn't there someone on here a few months ago with a few thousand trades who outlined his/her tax bill?"

2021-04-21 02:10:34,wallstreetbets,"If you really want to be safe, just pay the ~$300 and meet with a tax person and have them file for you. To me it‚Äôs worth it because they end up saving you way more than you could on turbo tax. However they will lightly grill you if your trades are mostly meme stocks ü§°"
2021-04-21 10:21:00,wallstreetbets,"Your broker should provide a 1099 that reports the gains and losses after the year is over. Assuming all the stocks were bought within the last few years they should show on Box A or D which as long as you don't have wash sales can be reported in summary on Sch D (lines 1a and 8a). If you have wash sales, those items should be separated from the rest and shown on Sch D (in summary) on lines 1b and 8b and then detailed on Form 8949.

FYI, if you are able to, always a good idea to try to check your brokers calc. I use ETrade and when RKT issued a dividend which resulted in options being repriced they changed the cost to $0. I contacted them and they corrected it to show the correct cost. Had they not corrected it, would probably have had something like $15K in overreported income."
2021-04-20 21:51:30,wallstreetbets,"One thing to note about taxes...if you are long on a stock, but it drops 10% and you think:
""Hey I'm going to sell now to realize the losses then rebuy around the same price so when I hold for 2-3 years then I'll get the benefit of realizing losses in the short term but get taxed on the gains long term.""

It simply doesnt work this way. You would need to either buy a different security on the re-buy after realizing losses or wait 30 days to rebuy the same security. 

I may be wrong but this is what I've figured so far in my reading of tax code.

And yes, pay for the premium tax program"
2021-04-21 02:38:45,wallstreetbets,How do wash sales work if you use multiple accounts/brokerages?

2021-04-20 23:43:57,wallstreetbets,most brokerages will send all forms and most tax software will allow you to do a summary report. I do have a question is there a way to change the method of taxation in a brokerage? Is there a time that has to be done? I mean for some of mine if I do allocated lots it might make more sense then average costing.

2021-04-21 00:51:21,wallstreetbets,"I have a question while we are all at it. If I have a stock worth $5k currently and sell for a $2500 loss, but then decide to buy leaps for the same stock I know it‚Äôs now a wash sale, but where does the taxes go against, does the original $5k show as a gain on my income even though it incurred the loss but can‚Äôt show it because the leaps won‚Äôt be optioned till potentially the following year? Or does the $5k off the sale roll into the options cost basis and I don‚Äôt have to show either the 5k or the 2.5k loss until the option is sold?"
2021-04-20 21:43:01,wallstreetbets,Use the 1099 provided from your broker. Be cautious of wash loss. I find people have to report much higher gains because they didn‚Äôt understand BASIC day trading rules. You‚Äôre limited to a 3k loss per year. The extra does carry from year to year but you have to make sure to carry the loss forward. My advice is pay a good tax professional. I see people screw up basic tax reporting all the time.

I get tripped up when I have different coat basis and make a sale. Say I buy 10 @100 and five days later 10@50 due to big swing and I want to avg down...the stock is at $75 right now, I want to hedge but I think it might sill hit 90 or maybe even 100 again so I sell 10@75 and set limit orders for 5@90 and 5@100...

2021-04-21 02:39:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the wash sale sucks.  This year will be ok for me.  Turbo tax worked well enough as I didn't make that much profit, about $5k.   But due to GME, next year is really going to suck.  Therefore, I'm going for Trader status.  I started an LLC, got my EIN, looking to tax as S Corp with Mark to market accounting.  May end up just finding a good CPA to finish it off though."
2021-04-21 13:51:15,wallstreetbets,Doesn‚Äôt the wash sale get averaged into the new share price ? And then if you take a loss on that the new loss gets calculated ?
2021-04-21 16:13:54,wallstreetbets,The wash sale just rolls over the loss to your new cost basis on your position.
2021-04-21 17:09:06,wallstreetbets,"Quarter million in wash sales last year. I was confused at first because I forgot to include them in my tax forms. When I did, my losses came out to -$6006 realized, just as planned."

2021-04-20 22:07:18,wallstreetbets,"That is completely wrong. Brokerages in the USA are required to report cost basis for equities acquired on or after January 1, 2011, Mutual fund and DRIP shares acquired on or after January 1, 2012 and everything else (debt securities, options, etc) acquired on or after January 1, 2014."

2021-04-20 22:32:22,wallstreetbets,"Nice.

Wish I was American right about now.

This doesn't work in Canada. Different tax rules and forms, I think, that don't allow your software to calculate a DCA on multiple trades in the same equity.

I spent about 20 hours this past weekend on my return. Should've hired someone but now have an appreciation for tax laws.

2021-04-20 22:53:13,wallstreetbets,"I've just started looking into taxes in Canada for next year, recently I started to trade in my cash account.  ( TFSA is maxed out )"
2021-04-20 23:19:18,wallstreetbets,Wow. Interesting. I guess I didn‚Äôt have as many as others!
2021-04-20 22:45:27,wallstreetbets,"The basic version is cheaper than what I quoted, yeah. I didn't think you could have capital gains and qualify for the basic version but maybe you can. I don't qualify for the basic version; I used them last year."
2021-04-21 13:25:54,wallstreetbets,"Oh...I thought it would be like....all my $50 shares would be taxed on the $25 gain, and all my $100 shares would be the wash (contributing to my $3k limit). Or possibly that like....all my $50 shares would be taxed on the $40 and $50 gain, and all my $100 shares would be the wash for having lost $25 each on those. 

So in summary I'm hearing: as long as it's the sameish stock, bought within 30 days, the IRS doesn't care about the individual profit of each share, just your total gain loss?

Edit: I'm smooth brain üòÅ"
2021-04-20 21:54:09,wallstreetbets,Yea wash sales would be the * in the equation. I think I remember that post and that idiot was trading in and out of the same stock repeatedly
2021-04-21 03:04:28,wallstreetbets,"Feb was pretty decent actually, about mid March to now, my stocks been trash"
2021-04-21 07:56:44,wallstreetbets,This is definitely a fake account.
2021-04-20 23:07:07,wallstreetbets,"If you're gonna trade a lot (particularly the same security) either:
1) hire someone to save you time
2) keep a running tally of your dollar cost average / average cost base (ACB)

I made over 100 trades last year and am at 200 this year ... It's not so bad with single positions but regardless they want you to calculate your ACB in Canadian dollars which means applying the F/X on the DAY of each trade.

There is one website that sort of does it for you but it was running slow for me so I just wrote a formula in Excel but still a giant PITA.

Basically you need to pay taxes on your net capital gains (CAD). Losses are carried forward or back. If you incur a loss within 30 days of buying the stock it is an ineligible loss and needs to be added back to the cost basis (unless you have closed out the position and don't rebuy within 30 days).

Also if you own more than 100K CAD in US equities (cost basis not market value) at any time in the year in a non registered account you need to file form T1135 ...

At least that's what I learned this weekend. I am not a tax expert though. There are sites out there that verified this so I'm pretty sure."

2021-04-21 16:52:47,wallstreetbets,End of year taxes are based on your total profit/loss. Now a wash sale is a little different you don‚Äôt want to do a wash sale because those don‚Äôt offset your gains and if you do them too often you can get a visit from the IRS.
2021-04-20 22:02:52,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs exactly what it was.

2021-04-21 06:51:56,wallstreetbets,"EDIT: u/ro0tshell has an important point to be noted if you're new to the concept of margin calls. The probability that you get margin called goes down as the asset you're shorting declines in value, as your position becomes more valuable. This seems like an easy thing to ensure if you have the money to keep shorting the asset, since shorting a stock drives down its value. The two ways an excessively shorted stock would most likely cause an account to be margin called would be: A. The shorted stock skyrockets very quickly on low volume; B. The premiums associated with shorting bleed the account until they have nothing but the short positions. Keep in mind that brokers are going to want to minimize risk as much as possible with margin accounts, after all, someone is gambling with their money. Margin calls are an indicator that the perceived risk of your portfolio exceeds that which the broker is willing to put up the collateral for (and short positions are super fucking risky alone--infinite loss and all that--couple that with extreme volatility and your short positions carry considerable risk).

A margin call happens if the value of a margin account falls below a broker's required limit. If a HF has a fuck ton of shorts positions, and they lose enough money to exceed their margin limit, they get margin called, meaning that they need to either deposit enough money into their account(s) or sell off other assets to bring their account value(s) above their broker's limit.

Now, regardless of your opinions on the DD behind stocks like GME, assume some asset is being repeatedly shorted by a HF; the longer they play out that strategy, the more positions they're required to sell off to keep their account from getting margin called. If they do get margin called, they can be forced to sell off any other assets they have until they meet their margin limit.

If a HF runs out of assets to liquidate and doesn't have enough cash to cover their shorts, someone has to step in to cover the positions for them. The negative beta of GME is thought to be because entities short on GME are being forced to sell off a ton of assets to prevent them from getting margin called.

Anyone feel free to correct this if I'm wrong. I'm wrong about things often, don't trust internet strangers to give you 100% accurate advice, do your own research friends, [here's](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) some more reliable info on margin calls.

2021-04-21 06:41:15,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs pretty much like; if you bought all your shares on credit, and you somehow got close to becoming a liability to the lender... (the shares increased in value, you didn‚Äôt have the money to cover what you borrowed, etc.) then the lender does a margin call which essentially asks you to cover what you borrowed by paying cash or liquidating your other assets to free up the cash. 

I think I said that okay. Smooth brain here just trying to help.

Oh and the margin % is the amount of money they require you have in the account in relation to the amt that security costs. So with GME if the margin % is 100, you‚Äôd have to have the same amount of cash in your account as the amount you‚Äôre borrowing to purchase the stock."

2021-04-21 18:00:12,wallstreetbets,False. Been under 1% for at least 5 months and I'm suspecting it'll stay that way for the next 6-12 months.
2021-04-21 03:07:51,wallstreetbets,"The borrow rate is supposed to be a function of share availability. The fact that the available shares regularly hit zero but still has a stupid low rate of 1% just means that the people lending shares are actively enabling the shorters who are suppressing the price.

If the people lending actually wanted to make money they'd charge 50-150% like they did last April-june during share recalls."

2021-04-20 23:19:14,wallstreetbets," They jack up the margin whenever the volatility jumps. GME and AMC have been volatile since January, so yes these popped up a few times already, first in January during the first squeeze and the in February, and today."

2021-04-21 13:19:34,wallstreetbets,That doesn‚Äôt make sense. Wouldn‚Äôt they know if you have the money in your account...? And put a hold on it if you sell a secured put...?
2021-04-21 00:58:01,wallstreetbets,And he/we likes the stock!
2021-04-21 17:24:08,wallstreetbets,"this of course doesn't happen when the asset in question has fallen from 260-150, in that case the PB extends more margin, as their position is worth more money.

but you're generally right, brokers float you a % of your account on ""credit"" and if your total account falls below a certain number they ask you to deposit funds or close positions, different securities have different margin requirements depending on how volatile they are.

In the case of GME anyone shorting the stock, the further it goes down, the better their position becomes, making it that much harder to get margin called."
2021-04-20 22:46:25,wallstreetbets,So if we sell at the new floor will we have to have said amount * 300% to cover the transaction? I don't think it works that way but need moral support.

2021-04-20 23:56:23,wallstreetbets,The 100% margin requirement was there when I signed up for a margin account last week.   I believe the 300% requirement for shorts is new though.
2021-04-20 22:52:58,wallstreetbets,300% for puts?
2021-04-21 11:46:34,wallstreetbets,Wait are you saying the people lending shares could be in cahoots with the shorters?

2021-04-21 19:29:08,wallstreetbets,"Oh I agree it's great for the longs. It's pure misery for the holder catching large marge.

Depending on the kind of call you catch, you might need 5x the call value in liquid cash to keep the position open, or 2x in fully marginable securities (yes transferring other stock positions can cover a call).

I suppose the other thing to mention is if the belief is that no margin call happened during the 480 spike, then the share price would have to exceed that at the very least this time around.

While most people here are at the mercy of their broker, actual real deal hedge funds will have margin requirements spelled out in contracts, there will be no ambiguity as to when they catch a call."
2021-04-20 23:17:44,wallstreetbets,Correct
2021-04-21 00:55:20,wallstreetbets,It used to be 200% in February.

2021-04-21 19:44:56,wallstreetbets,"And despite all the glaring inequalities between what retail and institutional investors can get away with, the great equalizer is that if you are gambling with someone else's money or shares, that bill will fucking come due at some point lol.  With the current volume of stocks like GME, these HFs would need someone to step in and mediate a renegotiation of their short position to let them get out of this mess. While I don't think this has ever happened, I know what my folks went through during the housing collapse and our entire financial system is built on trust in an exceedingly corrupt system that is content with ruining the lives of working-class individuals that are reduced to numbers. If it gets out that large bodies don't need to bear the same risks with their investment as us, that trust would be **GONE**."

2021-04-21 11:09:57,wallstreetbets,"sure, but the 300% margin requirement only kicks in once you exercise the put."
2021-04-21 15:00:58,wallstreetbets,DD not dad lol
2021-04-21 15:00:13,wallstreetbets,Oh fuck yeah man. But where‚Äôs the dad to prove it will reach 10 mill I‚Äôm sure a lot of ppl would sell off cause if it to drop right?
2021-04-21 19:53:20,wallstreetbets,"So I agree, these guys get access to instruments and %'s that retail will never see, though I am not sure the right move here is to give retail 10:1 margin, that feels like an accident waiting to happen.

These guys get ISDA agreements and prime brokerage services because they have billions to put up, I have portfolio margin because I have a good chunk of change at fidelity, it is true that money does buy access to more money, but they'd laugh at me if I asked for PB services (they in fact did giggle).

Hedge funds, unlike retail traders will also be allowed to go deep into the PNR, because of the amount of money on the line in both directions.

If there's a serious spike and margin call I would absolutely think a fund or two gets liquidated.

Where things start to come off the rails for me is thinking any of these funds would be permitted to open a position that could endanger the broker or something like the DTCC, the brokers risk desk would liquidate them out of existence without notice long before the position got to the point that Goldman or Morgan Stanley were in trouble.

Just look at what happened to big daddy Hwang, he woke up one morning and his fund just didn't exist anymore and the PB's were picking over the corpse. The second it was legal for them to end him they did.

I believe in the squeeze to a point, then we just go to crazy land and its hard to stay on topic :)"
2021-04-21 06:44:34,wallstreetbets,What part? The fundamental part of options are crazy at first. But straightforward once it clicks
2021-04-21 07:39:57,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs only if you sell a put.

Buying a put, and you or your broker exercise it, will give you -100 shares sold at the strike price of the put.

2021-04-21 06:33:19,wallstreetbets,who upvoted this nonsense. puts lead to shorted stock if you don't own the underlying. The whole point of exercising a put is put PUT your shares on someone else.
2021-04-21 11:15:26,wallstreetbets,It exercises for you when the put expires ITM.  Even on a non-margin account.

2021-04-21 17:25:10,wallstreetbets,What broker do you use? Most would let it expire.
2021-04-21 13:42:32,wallstreetbets,"Retail is us, you can buy options as a retail investor. options are just a derivative of the stock, essentially to be seen as a bet or insurance.

Watch some youtube videos, it's really not that complicated. Think of options as an insurance, I think it's easiest to understand that way. Call: You pay a relatively small amount of money (called premium) for the privilege to get a stock at a certain lower price (strike), in case its value goes up. Put: You pay the premium to be able to sell the stock at a certain value, if you wanna be insured against its decline. All options have an expiry date.

A lot of people play options here, because options have high leverage, meaning their value (the premium) moves drastically more than the value of the stock price. If you have 500 bucks, maybe you get 10 shares, if the share moves 5 bucks, you make 50 bucks. If you get calls for that money, 500 dollars of premium can mean the right to purchase hundreds of shares at a discounted price so the upside can be huge. The downside is that if the stock doesn't move your options will expire worthless which will happen often. If you had shares instead of that, they weren't going anywhere.

If you are just starting out buying ITM (in the money) options makes more sense (more conservative). And buy longer term and not make 1 week bets. Play safer. You can burn a lot of money in options if you are gambling for the sake of it. Also if your stock has risen a lot in value, but you don't want to withdraw your money yet in case it goes up more, buying puts might be a good safe play. So you can still get rid of your shit for good value if it goes bad. Options are primarily insurance against drastically rising and falling stock prices, if you manage to see it that way you'll have a more healthy initiation into this stuff and then you can think about gamble plays.

Selling options I won't talk about here. That's a bit of a different topic."

2021-04-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$VIAC Bananas üçåüçåüçå **TL;DR**. 

*Even in a declining environment VIAC is still fairly valued at* **$37.83.**  
*And in a bullish environment VIAC is fairly valued at* **$65.26.**.   
*And based on the EPV valuation it is a woapping* **$86.23**   

**VIAC offers a unique opportunity to take advantage of a current market in-efficiency.**   
As we all know by now a series of events lead to Archegos getting margin called. The Archegos fund was extremely aggressive and was operating under 5x leverage, heavily concentrating on Chinese and Media Stocks, such as BAIDU, BILI, TCEHY, IQ, VIAC, DISCA. There are many articles that explain how this margin call came to be. I won‚Äôt be discussing it here, because I want to discuss the opportunity this presents.

Whether you think Paramount + is good or not. I still think there is still an opportunity to cash in on VIAC‚Äôs assets. VIAC has a strong balance sheet and many assets that are valuable in the content business regardless if Paramount + takes off or not. Let‚Äôs address the elephants in the room. Can Paramount + compete with the top players like NFLX, DIS, or even HBO MAX?
I don‚Äôt think it matters if they can successfully compete or not because they have a huge library of content they can sell licences on and this makes them a valuable target to be acquired by the likes of AAPL or AMZN who are trying to pave their way into the streaming business. Their main revenue driver is cable television and everybody is cutting the cord these days so this is a shrinking segment, this does pose a risk to their recurring revenue. However they have another valuable asset that will help them offset this risk, and that is live sports. Although cable TV is shrinking, sports is definitely not and VIAC has many contracts and rights to stream live sports on their Paramount + service. None of the top 3 streaming services I mentioned does live sports streaming, and I‚Äôm sure they would love to add live sports on their library of contents. Their only competitor in the live sports segment FUBO. I do not perceive FUBO as a threat yet as they‚Äôre extremely overvalued and the business is losing money and has a lot of catching up to do. Even if FUBO is acquired before VIAC does, the acquisition of FUBO will force the other large streaming service to try and acquire their own to compete.

**The Valuation:**

I will present you with 3 different valuation all of them assume Paramount + is a flop and does not take off so I assume zero growth on their streaming service.   

Scenario one: Bullcase, I assume they will grow their total revenue by 3-5% for the next 5 year.  
[Revenue Estimates](https://imgur.com/78x276u).  
[DCF Valuation](https://imgur.com/s6TOmhj)

Scenario two: Bearcase, I assume their total revenue will be shrinking by  (-) 7-3%.  
[Revenue Calculations](https://imgur.com/JUWIXuz).  
[DCF Valuation](https://imgur.com/gra7R5E).  

Scenario three: I used an old school valuation method to value the business, Earning Power Value (EPV). In the EPV method it takes away the requirement for trying to predict the future and only takes into account the present business earning power. This method of valuation assumes no growth to the business. This method of valuation is a good valuation metric for valuing mature non growing businesses.   
[EPV Valuation](https://imgur.com/un2fh7u)

**Conclusion:**

Even in a declining environment VIAC is still fairly valued at **$37.83**.  
And in a bullish environment VIAC is fairly valued at **$65.26**.  
And based on the EPV valuation it is a woapping **$86.23**.

2021-04-20 22:29:17,wallstreetbets,in the bull case I assume they would normalized back to their pre-covid levels and continue on a slow growth trend based on the industry average (pre-covid).

2021-04-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NVAX - Likely my last update DD before reaching Callhalla I've made a few posts before this ( [1st Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3ksw/nvax_dont_miss_this_perfect_vaccine_play_headed/),  [2nd Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luuige/nvax_part_ii_last_call_before_a_shit_ton_of/), [3rd Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mlielu/nvax_i_liked_it_at_300_i_love_it_at_180/)) but I know it's alot to go through so I shall give a brief comprehensive summary here. Just a reminder none of this is financial advice, I am but a mere PhD student that has had the ride of their lives on this stock. My goal isn't to shill or hype but instead to sharpen the conviction of my fellow big-cojone'd NVAX bulls, to concentrate info from different sources, and to create a space for discussion and overleveraged speculation. I think this stock is done taking a shit, we have a good idea of lower bound supports, and we're ready to blow some loads with upcoming catalysts. I also have some current questions I'd like to get the input of the community on. So let's dig in!

**1) Why I believe in the technology**

Really recommend my first post for a more in-depth discussion on this but basically this vaccine is antigen-based which is a very standard tried-and-true modality often used in ""traditional"" vaccines like flu vaccines etc. What makes them special is they add a natural compound (an ""adjuvant"") that makes your immune system super responsive to the antigen. This adjuvant is actually a saponin that is harvested from soapbark trees that grow in Chile. The benefit of using this is that 1) old people and people with weak immune systems respond well and build immunity even with lower doses of antigen 2) you can make vaccines with small amounts of antigen which makes them much cheaper and MOST IMPORTANTLY 3) you can ""fit"" more antigen varieties into a single dose. There's only so much antigen you can inject into a person at once so with this technology you can have a single vaccine with flu AND several covid variant antigens as opposed to having to get a separate vaccine for each virus. Also since this vaccine is protein antigen based you can keep it at 4C (same temp you keep your beers) for months.

Additionally!!!!! We've seen alot of AMAZING efficacy and safety results from the UK and SA phase 1/2/3 trials and the US phase 1/2 trial (still waiting for phase 3 data to drop soon!). **This is one of the main reasons I remain so bullish.** The humongous unknown risk of efficacy/safety has been largely cleared and now we're just sifting through some other issues/bottlenecks/FUD that I will talk about below. Anyone that trades biotech stocks knows that safety/efficacy are the BIGGEST risk that can curb stomp a stock and we've cleared that in my opinion.

&#x200B;

**2) A brief history of this chart**

This is one of the wildest charts you'll find and I think it's incredibly important to understand what caused it to look like that so that you can get a better picture of where we're going.

**Sept 2016** \- Plummet from \~$150 to \~$25 came from their RSV vaccine getting poor efficacy results

**Feb 2019** \- Plummet from \~$40 to \~$10 came from them failing the RSV efficacy trials again lmao. HOWEVER things are looking up for RSV vaccine recently (this deserves its own DD honestly but you can read more about it [here](https://www.novavax.com/our-pipeline))

At this point you can see why investors had no faith in NVAX. It was beaten down like a rabid dog like Ziptrader Charlie would say. Enter covid left stage:

**May 2020** \- Gap up from \~$15 to \~$40 came from A) fantastic nano-Flu phase 3 results (their very own flu vaccine, shown to be better than the current state-of-the-art flu vaccines) which is basically their first big WIN and B) beginning of clinical trials for covid vaccine.

**Aug 2020** \- Gap up to $180 came from great phase 1/2 covid vaccine results! I remember these glory days. Too bad we then plummeted and became range bound in the $80-$100 range. This was caused by a combo of sell-the-news and competitor companies (MRNA, BNTX, JNJ, AZN) making fast progress.

**Feb 2021**  \- Gap up to $300 from phase 3 interim data coming from UK phase 3 trial. This was fantastic news! Best in class vaccine with stellar safety and 96% efficacy against original variant. 

**Mar 2021 - Present** \- We fell from grace and have been bouncing between $170 and $220. Lots of factors here but of course the March market madness did not help this low float stock. I vividly remember NVAX falling 10+% day after day during the worst of it. I kept buying the dip and now I'm jacked to the MF tits and not ready to sell even when we get nice 13% days here and there.

Notice anything so far about this chart? **It loves to gap up**. This is a low float stock and the market cap is comparably small compared to competitors like MRNA, JNJ, etc. It's not uncommon to see it almost double when BIG catalysts drop and trust me when I tell you we've got ALOT of big catalysts on the menu. We've recently found a ROCK HARD floor at $170 and most recently a very strong support at $200. This stock has been severely de-risked and I think right now is still a damn good time to buy because of this asymmetrical risk.

&#x200B;

**3) Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt - Bear case and the FUD spread by short sellers**

\-*NVAX is too late to the game. The entire world is vaccinated already. Pandemic is over.* This is obviously not true and I've written extensively about it in my 2nd and 3rd posts. India, home to 1.4 BILLION people has only vaccinated a little more than 1% of its vaccination. India is currently the epicenter of the pandemic with cases going parabolic recently sadly. It should also be noted that NVAX has a [deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-gavi-cumulative) with the Gavi Institute in India to manufacture and deliver 1.1 Bn doses of covid vaccines. More on India a little further down the post. Additionally, new variants continue to pop up and it seems more and more like we'll be getting covid booster shots for a while.

\-*Insiders are selling so they know something is up*. This is so stupid don't fall for this trap. They've sold days before major catalysts in the past. Everything is scheduled ahead of time and from what I understand also has something to do with them exercising their options. Let's not even mention the fact that selling millions in stock right before you drop horrible news would be the most blatant illegal insider trading ever lol

\-*NVAX is having manufacturing issues. They're not gonna be able to produce the vaccines they promised, just look at what happened to the EU deal.* I wrote about this alot in my 3rd post. I was worried at first that the raw materials they were missing perhaps was the adjuvant that comes from the soapbark trees (yikes!) However, as it turns out [the problem is actually the supply of 2,000 liter plastic bags](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/lack-grow-bags-a-hefty-problem-for-novavax-s-covid-19-vaccine-production-push) that they need to grow their cells. The bags exist but they're currently being locked up by the US as per the Defense Production Act. Literally the US is reserving the bags for Pfizer and now the institute in India that is supposed to produce a ton of the NVAX vaccines does not have access to them. However the CEO of the institute has [publicly pleaded for Biden to lift the embargo](https://twitter.com/megtirrell/status/1383129792292167680) and it seems like their may be [some action here soon](https://twitter.com/Cold_Peace_/status/1384537640322674689) especially given the dire COVID situation in India. I honestly have no fucking idea what will happen and this is simply what I have gathered in my investigative work across sources. Any clarity or insight here is super appreciated. I don't even know if these bags are reason NVAX was having manufacturing issues for the EU. Regardless, GSK is making some of the NVAX vaccine soon and they should have some stockpiled already at least for the UK and early approvers.

\-*NVAX US phase 3 trials must have had bad results that's why they haven't released the data yet.* I saved this one for last because it's the most unlikely one in my opinion. I'd be surprised to see repeatedly stellar results in US phase 1/2, UK phase 1/2/3interim/3final trials only to see something worse than JNJ's 66% efficacy in the US/Mexico phase 3 trial.

&#x200B;

**4) Catalysts and Questions for y'all**

OK this is where I summarize what I think will happen soon and also where I need input from y'all. NVAX has completely left us bagholders (oops, I mean investors) in the dark on some of these expected dates and it has been the source of [much strife in twitter comments](https://twitter.com/Novavax/status/1384489266483433472) against the leadership and PR team of NVAX. Not gonna lie they can learn to market and pump themselves more but I appreciate their hardwork on getting the science done well regardless.

**A) Filing for UK Approval**

\-From what I understand NVAX has already begun the rolling review by the UK MHRA and EU's EMA. They have provided the interim data for UK phase 3 at least and they hopefully have also submitted the finalized UK phase 3 data at this point but I do not know. 

\-Another thing they need to submit is a CMC package. This basically is evidence they provide these regulatory agencies that their manufacturing process is robust and can produce consistent vaccine batches. I have NO idea what the status is with this (did they finish it already?) and any insight is appreciated.

\-I can only imagine they'd make an announcement when they actually file in the UK but who knows. I also am curious to know how long after filing we can expect to see approval. My hope is that this whole process will be done and the vaccine will be approved by the [end of April](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-vaccine/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-approved-by-uk-in-april-evening-standard-says-idUSKBN2BM1IF).

\-Guidance on this could literally drop any day this week or next week and I'm willing to bet we'll gap up on the news as always. As soon as it's approved by the UK then Canada, Australia, and New Zealand will likely follow suit.

**B) US Phase 3 results**

\-I'm super excited this is gonna be fucking awesome

\-US/Mexico Phase 3 trials started much later than the UK phase 3 trials. People were concerned for a long time that it would take a ton of time to get results. Even NVAX executives were saying that they were gonna swing for the fences and see if the US FDA would consider an EUA just with UK data instead of having to wait for US data. 

\-Turns out there were tons of willing participants and the trial got 25,000 people signed up in record time. Additionally, waves of covid caused collection of endpoints to happen much faster than expected. TODAY they started crossover trials. This basically means that people that had received the placebo get the read vaccine and people that got the real vaccine get the placebo (they are all still blinded). What is significant about this is that [THEY WOULDN'T DO THE CROSSOVER WITHOUT FIRST GETTING ENOUGH ENDPOINTS TO FILE FOR AN EUA](https://twitter.com/NayeemTheDream/status/1384265587770023942?s=1001).

\-We basically were all but explicitly told that US phase 3 is complete and the data/news can drop any day now. Put on your spacesuits.

**C) US FDA filing**

\-NVAX is [aiming for May](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/novavax-targets-may-approval-for-covid-19-vaccine-u-s). 

\-Again, I have no idea what the status is on the CMC package for the US filing and any insight is welcome.

\-There are some [interesting speculations on twitter](https://twitter.com/Biohazard3737/status/1384595862202896385) but I have a hard time making sense of them. Take it with a grain of salt as this guy/gal says him/herself.

**D) EU Deal**

\-The EU deal fell through last month but it seems like it could be getting revived soon. They are facing pressure after the AZN shitshow. 

\-This would be an awesome catalyst but don't hold your breath these EU chiefs are slow AF and seem to be generally fumbling oftentimes when it comes to securing doses for their populace

&#x200B;

**5) My positions and good ways to play this**

\-My positions are all in on $200c 5/21 options. Like literally my whole portfolio. I don't know that I would recommend this approach for most, the IV on these options is insanely high. I do, however, expect the IV of these options to expand following one of these catalysts. I know this is the opposite of what we typically think of with IV crush following binary events. However, I think the stock is exceptionally undervalued and I DO NOT think approval has been priced in. The majority of the gain will hopefully come from intrinsic value from the calls going deep ITM but I also hope to get an IV bump as people realize that this company has a rich future ahead of it and the call options gain demand. It has been an absolutely wild ride but I'm comfortable to say I now understand the true meaning of diamond hands.

\-Shares of course (or LEAPS) are godly if you have that sort of capital. Then you can just hang on for a long time. I will definitely switch to LEAPS after this immediate saga is over. I think once NVAX starts actually making a revenue it will absolutely blow earnings out of the park.

\-If you want to take advantage of high IV then of course theta gang strategies are nice. I caution against selling calls, this stock is ready to pop. Selling puts is a good strategy though you'll miss out on the extra tendies if they go parabolic. I severely caution against close expiration put credit spreads even though they are bullish because this stock CAN be squirrely and drop 10% in a day. If your spreads close OTM you can lose it all.

It‚Äôs historically taken the NVAX longer than expected to release trial results. I think it might be 2-3 weeks yet before we get news. That‚Äôs was the case with the UK study. There were tons of people trying to model the release date. 

Just to offer a reason that results couple come later than anticipated: they may be starting the crossover study because they know it will take a long time to actually administer the crossover and they are loosing people to other vaccines (you can drop out of you have access to another vax and they have to unblind you). 

I would be concerned holding 5/21 calls. 

I‚Äôm loading up on shares and 7/16 $250 calls and anywhere between 200-400 shares (selling at local max, buying at local min)

I was wrecked on the tumble from $300 to $150 so I‚Äôm cautiously building my position back up."
2021-04-20 21:08:26,wallstreetbets,My biggest issue with NVAX is that these guys are slow compared to Moderna/Pfizer...granted Covid isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon but NVAX has executed at a snail‚Äôs pace compared to its peers on the vaccine front :(
2021-04-21 11:16:38,wallstreetbets,This is $500 all day. 70 million shares. Low float.

2021-04-21 04:13:44,wallstreetbets,"Bear case: 1. The thing about being late to the market is that everyone else already has contracts for SUPPLIES needed for the vaccine production. And those supplies are also finite, as in producers of those supplies can't just stomp production facilities out of the ground overnight. 2. Biden is thinking lifting the IP on vaccines. That would be a smart move because once the US is vaccinated, the biggest danger will be MUTATIONS, so the faster we get rid of this thing globally, the better for EVERYONE. Obvs. he would only do that after the US is vaccinated. Who will be punished the most? Those late to the party.

And yes, NVAX tech might be better for mutations/booster shots, so that's a bull case again. NOT saying any of those are necessarily going to happen, just don't fool yourself thinking this is a sure thing. Just saying it so you can weigh risk accordingly. I have no beef in this, I already closed my position at a small profit."

It's gonna need to *really* deliver on the vaccine to turn positive imo.

2021-04-21 10:01:08,wallstreetbets,I did mention it‚Äôs more like a traditional vaccine but I should have been more clear! Absolutely this is a huge plus. Lots of hesitancy especially in Europe where their main option is AZN.
2021-04-21 11:05:21,wallstreetbets,Fantastic insight! This is incredibly helpful and totally seems about right time-wise. I had switched to 5/21 calls to increase my leverage when we were crawling out of the pit of despair. I will cash those out if we get a nice bump to $220-230 again and then buy back in with July calls.
2021-04-20 21:32:18,wallstreetbets,Maybe slow is good. Seems the others rushed it and now people are getting blood clots
2021-04-21 04:37:07,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not about who dose it first... it‚Äôs who does it right. 

NVAX will be the preferred product all said and done"
2021-04-21 09:50:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah NVAX technology takes about a month extra to develop a novel vax when compared to MRNA or PFE. HOWEVER, I do think NVAX has a clear head-start on developing a variant vaccine or a flu+covid vaccine. They are starting SA variant trials this summer and in theory they only have to demonstrate safety which is much faster as far as data collection goes. Additionally, they are starting Flu+covid trials this Fall/Winter and they have the massive advantage over MRNA and PFE that they actually have a standalone Flu vaccine already with great efficacy. Finally I think mRNA-based vaccines are running into dose-limitation issues making it hard to make a booster with many variants in it."
2021-04-21 09:44:56,wallstreetbets,Absolutely! We‚Äôre seeing alot of hesitancy especially in the EU and UK where the main option is AZN. I think this is turning up the pressure to approve NVAX.
2021-04-21 09:43:09,wallstreetbets,"These are super good counterarguments. We kind of already are seeing the supply chain issue with the plastic bag shortage. Could affect them longer term but I think alot of these near-term catalysts are still on the menu. 

Also the IP thing is quite ridiculous imo. I know people are quick to support it bc it seems like a noble thing to do. But what you end up doing is disenfranchising the companies that developed the vaccines. It‚Äôs like an anti-incentive for innovation. If we want to be noble how about paying for vaccines and shipping them to countries in need? Regardless I think that this IP thing has a slim chance of pulling through."
2021-04-21 04:39:30,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a sure thing if you understand the science
2021-04-21 09:56:37,wallstreetbets,Like I said it has been crazy!! I do think it‚Äôll easily make it past $300 with UK approval. This stock is super low float it‚Äôs insane. The other day we were up 13% just bc JNJ had been recalled.

2021-04-21 05:10:05,wallstreetbets,"The science says that NVAX has a superior product, is not mRNA based, doesn‚Äôt have the supply chain issues and freezing issues, and will be the preferred product downstream + they have nanflu rolling out which will also become the new standard of care and production method for flu vaccines.

2021-04-21 05:49:32,wallstreetbets,"The flu vaccine is the real key here... not Covid like all the hype boys think 

New production method. Long term share holders = money. It‚Äôll get ironed out and whatnot. They only expected to produce flu vaccines about a year ago and now they have that + Covid. Takeda is also helping produce

Funny thing about that guy, and paper-hands-portnoy, and several others: I had literally never heard of them prior to their getting press pushing GME to bail out or otherwise stir shit.  As a general rule, if everyone seems to know of someone I've never even heard of, I have to assume it's because they're hopelessly brainwashed by the media and hoping on the latest craze, so they aren't going to be the ones to listen to, could also be stated as not trusting any random person who comes along, or just inverse the masses and you're usually on a good course.

Even SPCE is still a 2x profit for people dumb enough to be holding.

Chamath isn't forcing anyone to buy at 4x the value he bought at. It's just retards joining in too late on the plays he's almost guaranteed to make for you.

2021-04-20 20:11:19,wallstreetbets,No they had a huge run up to almost 30 I remember like 1 month or so ago when they announced their partnerships.  Then it's been nothing but down since then.  All EVs been battered though.  TSLA is hanging in there though.  Just been rough.
2021-04-21 01:01:36,wallstreetbets,They have 1b cash and a 3b valuation. Not merit based but I also think their car is attractive which is rare so most people probably will too. They don't have many liabilities but their profit potential is high. Most of exec staff are being paid min wage to conserve cash and are very incentivized to perform well. It's a lower risk and higher reward play than you think.
2021-04-20 22:05:29,wallstreetbets,I started reading some interesting bear posts on the company a month back and then Fisker and the rest of EVs start tanking. I'm bearish on this EV tho. Seems like they can't produce a legitimate product
2021-04-21 01:31:00,wallstreetbets,What IP do they have? Are they using any of it on their vehicle?
2021-04-21 00:40:23,wallstreetbets,"Fisker, again, has contracted out most of the important parts of building an EV. This got the first company into trouble when technical issues arose and they simply didn‚Äôt have the expertise to correct the issues in time before money ran out. They think asset lite is a good strategy, which insane for a business environment which will need a lot of fast iteration and close coordination of software and many hardware components. A decade ago there were few competitors and most of them were terrible so it was an easier environment for a start up. That is no longer the case as everyone gearing up to compete in EVs. Add to it that they designed and announced a vehicle before sorting out the actual platform and therefore the various specific components. This is backwards. FF-PAD is a joke. In the end, they don‚Äôt have much actual IP or in-house expertise, a little worse than last time."
2021-04-20 22:07:28,wallstreetbets,Same here.  Sounds too good to be true.  38.5k for SUV EV with solar roof and leather.   Before tax credits.  They don't make anything themselves so that's going to eat into margins too.  Not sure how they are going to make money off that car.
2021-04-21 01:06:32,wallstreetbets,"You should look into Magna's customers. Most car companies outsource. BMW, Mercedes, etc. If you are talking about the battery then it's been done before too and much less risky than trying to do it themselves. Pagani did it with Mercedes (albeit much smaller scale) with the engines. It's possible. And most companies already do it. I actually respect your points but I ultimately find them just as speculative, if not more, as betting on the company."
2021-04-21 00:54:15,wallstreetbets,But they contracted out to magna and foxconn who have the capability and experience to keep any issues under control. Is that fair to assess?
2021-04-21 01:08:12,wallstreetbets,"BMW does outsource to Magna, but they have a tremendous amount of inside engineering talent and resources. Fisker has not much of anything.

If Fisker is going to be a small boutique automaker, then they won‚Äôt be worth billions. Market cap should drop by 90%, but even an optimistic scenario puts them under WKHS‚Äôs $1.5 billion. So maybe a 60% drop in the short term, long term more likely 90% drop."
2021-04-21 00:55:21,wallstreetbets,"The problem is that either they own nothing and it is really a Magna vehicle, or they own parts if it and integration work becomes difficult. Why pay for an empty shell of a company?"
2021-04-21 01:46:56,wallstreetbets,">but they have a tremendous amount of inside engineering talent and resources. Fisker has not much of anything.

Easy to post bear things like this. I genuinely just disagree. The Fisker Karma was miles ahead of its time and proved that Henrik knew his shit. Yeah they had battery problems and other issues, but they certainly proved they have engineering talent.

>If Fisker is going to be a small boutique automaker, then they won‚Äôt be worth billions. Market cap should drop by 90%, but even an optimistic scenario puts them under WKHS‚Äôs $1.5 billion. So maybe a 60% drop in the short term, long term more likely 90% drop

That's not how the markets work. Firstly, Workhorse has significantly less cash and more debt. Secondly, NIO is priced at 1.25x projected 2025 revenues. They burn cash but they are proving they can scale. If Fisker meets projections then your ""60% optimistic scenarios"" are fairy tale. I don't feel like going to much into it but the analysts at Morgan and BAC followed similar projection targets as me. That's all that matters. If they miss projections then Fisker will go to zero; if they hit then they will be worth much higher. That's really all it boils down to. Nobody knows how to value it now."
2021-04-21 01:34:08,wallstreetbets,"But by that logic is apple a shell company for foxconn?  Fisker company serves as the head of design while magna and Foxconn deliver the parts while working in close coordination with each other.  It‚Äôs a concept worth rolling the dice on since building factory infrastructure like Tesla and other EV startups is a gross undertaking.  

I‚Äôm no expert at all I have a small stake in Fisker and I‚Äôd like to see them succeed. I have a space in my imagination where they partner with apple to create some sort of vehicle.  I don‚Äôt think an apple car is what they are planning but more like an apple body kit along the lines of Mercedes and Amg."
2021-04-21 06:54:38,wallstreetbets,"NIO is selling around 7,000 vehicles a year. Much of the engineering around the vehicles is their own, even though they do outsource the manufacturing. Note that stock price was under $1.50 as they had issues right after the ES8 launch. They didn‚Äôt climb out of that until recently with their production and sales volumes increasing. Even then, the price was raised by TSLA‚Äôs S&P 500 addition.

And no, the Fisker Karma had many issues including incomplete software, excessive weight, underperforming motors, and so forth. They never achieved the promised power and powertrain reliability was an issue.

https://www.thethings.com/why-the-fisker-karma-failed/

Fisker is not worth the cash because that cash has to be spent... Given almost zero real engineering, they are hoping to be just a brand and a design. And when things go wrong like they are likely to do, Fisker has, again, little to no control. That isn‚Äôt worth much at all."
2021-04-21 06:46:59,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs a pretty ignorant remark wrt the engineering at Apple. Foxconn is the final assembler. In this case, very little about the vehicle is engineered by Fisker."
2021-04-21 07:41:55,wallstreetbets,Fisker is the lead design team for all the systems and engineering elements provided to them by Foxconn and Magna.  How is that a shell of a company?  Their roster is deep including Bill McDermott who has ties to to apple and other executives with similar experience. You can be bearish but if you use the word ignorant you owe a deeper explanation or the comment is just annoying.
2021-04-21 08:55:45,wallstreetbets,"Who designs the battery pack? Who designs the BMS? Who designs the motors, the inverters, the body management computers? Who has the responsibility to fix things If integration goes badly? The fact that Fisker showed the Ocean and was still shopping for the VW MEB platform, which was then shut down tells us a lot. Fisker is telling you they are asset lite with a philosophy of platform agnosticism... which means they have none of the engineering chops. Instead of learning from last time, they went even further. Now, the suppliers are more competent this time around, but it means at best, they are a low volume boutique automaker that has to make margin over their contract suppliers that supply almost all the car. The value add is minuscule. Therefore the valuation company is way out of whack... at best, it should be trading near its cash level, as we know they are going to burn all of that."

2021-04-21 10:23:29,wallstreetbets,"If you‚Äôre going to buy calls when IV is this high, at the very least hedge a bit with vertical spreads. You‚Äôre going to be hurting when the price stabilizes (even if it stabilizes higher than it is today)."

2021-04-20 23:31:31,wallstreetbets,No idea how you‚Äôre drawing that parallel. They are not even close to operating in the same industry
2021-04-21 11:30:01,wallstreetbets,So you think within the year they're a $200 billion dollar company?
2021-04-20 20:07:01,wallstreetbets,Why is Riot more expensive than Mara? It used to be the other way around
2021-04-20 21:16:02,wallstreetbets,Riot has 7000 miners with plans for 106000 miners over next few years. Mara has 3600  miners and lower growth pattern. My numbers may be slightly off but they are close ...that‚Äôs the numbers I researched earlier.

2021-04-20 21:42:38,wallstreetbets,I know. I'm so sick of these stocks. I keep thinking the next bit of good news will help... I obviously know nothing of how the world works.
2021-04-21 13:47:44,wallstreetbets,"I think all these weed stocks are considerably overvalued due to the spikes in early Feb.

Tilray was sitting around $5 to $8 all year, then it shoots up $63 and has been steadily dropping since then. 

Most of these meme stocks are still correcting from their insane spike. The correction is taking a while because people keep buying thinking it can shoot back up to spike levels."

I am hoping for a split soon. will hold this stock for at least 5-10 years. can't go wrong with ISRG.  Years ago, I waited for a pullback and it ended up going to the 900 level right after that, it split 3 to 1 and the rest as they say is history."

2021-04-20 22:33:02,wallstreetbets,"Probably should check their social media for video of them hacking it to defeat the checks for a driver being there.  Wouldn't be too surprised if that eventually surfaced.

Or maybe the doctor had a cadaver in the driver's seat to defeat it.  Would be hilarious, I'd think they would immediately figure that one out if it was the case though."

2021-04-20 22:11:14,wallstreetbets,"I watched several Netflix documentaries lately.

Medal of Honor took content for 15 mins and turned it into an hour per episode. I like war/history content but it was so slow and boring I had to turn it off.

Then I watched ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fuck with cats‚Äù and thought it was interesting before the episode ended. Then I was shocked to see they made a 4-5 hour miniseries out of what should have been an hour tops. I had to skip 80% of it because of how slow and repetitive it got.


Seems like their model is to draaag it way out. Have 5 random people take turns telling the exact same story from their point of view. Yawn. 

Getting bored of their original content"
2021-04-21 13:10:00,wallstreetbets,"Well yeah, everyone already has an account."

2021-04-20 23:36:56,wallstreetbets,My problem with netflix is too much competition. Not to mention there is a lag so say they create something and it doesn't immediately take off but is good if it doesn't get enough initial it will be just one season. I also think the streaming services will be a race to the bottom where we end back up at similar to cable. Generally people are sharing these accounts and no one is going to pay 10 services for 15.
2021-04-21 02:19:06,wallstreetbets,1.Pandemic over and 2. Every movie studio seems tied up to a streaming service 3. AMC is now open hahaha

2021-04-21 08:43:56,wallstreetbets,They've got done really shitty cable tv style shows on there now. Youtube is king for me

2021-04-21 11:24:11,wallstreetbets,"you don‚Äôt say. can‚Äôt dilute the product, then raise prices in the midst of a power creep from competition. they started pandering to content that was rushed to meet certain demographics, or whatever was socially trending. instead of focusing on the quality content that many of us were already tied to."
2021-04-21 11:39:08,wallstreetbets,Bye bye the office bye bye profits
2021-04-21 13:51:00,wallstreetbets,Fuck Netflix. But seems to be catching a support. Calls? Or more red?
2021-04-21 14:47:21,wallstreetbets,"Infinite growth is such a stupid concept. Let‚Äôs say all 7B humans on the planet get an account, will the market tank the stock because they are not adding new subscribers?"
2021-04-21 15:13:18,wallstreetbets,"Since Netflix always jails its anime collabs I have no reason to be subscribed. I would like to support the official release of a new show, but I am not waiting until the whole thing has aired in Japan for Netflix to post it.  That's not how watching anime works.  Add on that their ownership of certain IP leads to extremely long waits for any form of physical release (Little Witch Academia is a prime example) and I don't want to give them a dime.  I cancelled my subscription over a year ago."
2021-04-21 19:33:57,wallstreetbets,"The fact is Netflix is spending money on crap shows that won't stand the test of time.  So while they're spending money on content who's going to watch it a year from now.  And the shows that work, they don't properly end their series.   And when they do that it ruins the rewatchability.    Their PC first and storytelling last will catch up with them.

We're seeing with Nielsen streaming ratings, what's really popular.  And they don't have shows with hundreds of episodes of content, that's been on for a decade or more.  They really miss shows like the Office or NCIS or any Law in Order franchise.

VIAC and Peacock may have an advantage there.  And NFLX spending 100 million plus for movies and not releasing it in theaters first is costing them.  Releasing it in theaters adds to the prestige of the film and supplements the cost.  Who remembers ""Bright', they may have more respect for it made 400 million worldwide.

Frankly I'm just watching classic shows on broadcast tv subchannels, they're new to me. And their classic shows have been remastered and since they were filmed, so it looks good on my 75 inch 4K tv.  

 I still have HBO Max('free' because of my AT&T internet plan), Netflix('free' because my T-mobile plan), peacock on a discount because I signed up for WWE plan. I actually pay for crunchyroll premium.   All these new streaming shows are unwatchable PC garbage."
2021-04-21 19:57:25,wallstreetbets,We watched it all.

2021-04-21 04:41:24,wallstreetbets,"Genius scientists must be black. Women must be the smartest but underrated and ridiculed by stupid men.

Literally, Queen's Gambit was originally based on a story of a male and they put a woman into the role.

2021-04-20 22:34:08,wallstreetbets,"I never thought I'd see the day, this makes me bullish on NFLX honestly they finally proved they can make money. But it might be due to less production costs during the pandemic?"
2021-04-21 01:46:39,wallstreetbets,so they should be worth at most 40 billion market cap. so around 100$ share price target. GOT IT

2021-04-21 07:15:14,wallstreetbets,"Prime is even fucking worse holy shit it has the same crap as netflix but without the netflix originals, in the Netherlands I have to spend 6 euros to watch the first Harry Potter movie, if I want acces to anything remotely interesting like documentaires I have to buy another 2 euros a month for them"

2021-04-21 02:57:27,wallstreetbets,"Each country has a different price. In italy it‚Äôs 38‚Ç¨ per year, but there is a 50% off discount for students so it becomes 18‚Ç¨ per year. There are similar promotions in other EU countries. For example, in France it would be 48‚Ç¨/year, but with Amazon Prime Student it becomes 24‚Ç¨/year"
2021-04-21 03:10:10,wallstreetbets,"In the Netherlands it's currently ‚Ç¨3 per month, honestly a steal"
2021-04-21 11:11:03,wallstreetbets,"It depends on the region. Where I live Netflix didn't have The Office, but Amazon Prime did, so that was quite nice. Recently Prime removed Seinfeld but it will be added to Netflix this summer. Same with movies. Also Prime here is ‚Ç¨2.90 which is cheaper than a coffee and it includes 1 day shipping, to me is a no brainer."
2021-04-21 08:56:13,wallstreetbets,boo
2021-04-21 00:42:27,wallstreetbets,Ozark FTW
2021-04-21 10:31:36,wallstreetbets,"For the younger set they have lots of TV shows with deep libraries. They have every princess movie, plus they bought Fox and got NatGeo and Simpsons in the deal. They get to put the more adult stuff on Hulu. If you have kids, they will likely enjoy D+, Hulu, or both. That‚Äôs a huge market share."
2021-04-21 04:42:22,wallstreetbets,Or actually caring about some level of accuracy if the stories are based on reality.

2021-04-20 23:18:03,wallstreetbets,What happened with Mindhunter? Great show.
2021-04-20 23:20:05,wallstreetbets,I don't think Mindhunter was cancelled cancelled. They just released the actors from their contracts and the director moved to other projects amidst the whole covid-19 shit. We may see another season unless the actors schedules don't line up. Maybe.
2021-04-21 01:30:01,wallstreetbets,RIP Mindhunter

2021-04-21 00:13:00,wallstreetbets,"Uhhhh have you seen Cuties? That shit was so fucked up, never should have made it on screen. I canceled my Netflix subscription after they didn‚Äôt pull that garbage, and now I‚Äôm finding that I don‚Äôt really miss it."
2021-04-21 03:10:19,wallstreetbets,"I turned stranger things season 3 off during the first couple minutes because it depicted a couple ""preteens"" making out which made me vomit in my mouth a little. If this is where media is headed I'm not looking forward to more netflix shows."

2021-04-21 07:35:37,wallstreetbets,"Well Harry Potter isn‚Äôt even available on Netflix at all here... Any of them! I mainly watch tv series and I find a lot more of 3rd party stuff on Prime than on Netflix, in general I think there‚Äôs obviously less originals but more 3rd party stuff. And for 18‚Ç¨/year (students discount) which includes free shipping on amazon, free twitch sub and some other things, I definitely can‚Äôt complain about it, it comes basically free for how much I‚Äôm using Amazon. I just won‚Äôt buy any on demand stuff for silly prices, I think documentaries are all free but you are right I also have many films where I have to pay extra."
2021-04-21 01:29:06,wallstreetbets,Huge influx of Indian content in Canada.
2021-04-21 11:06:46,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but the German Amazon has more products than the new Dutch one. Or is it possible to buy in amazon.de with Prime benefits from .nl?"

they have infinite money and all they need is 1 shit show like mandalorian a year to retain all 200 million subs"
2021-04-21 13:19:22,wallstreetbets,"Terrace House, Lupin, Kingdom, Pandemic"
2021-04-21 01:05:27,wallstreetbets,"So therefore Star Wars isn‚Äôt really a Disney thing, right? So Disney sucks because the only good things they have are Star Wars, MCU and Pixar?"
2021-04-21 09:09:20,wallstreetbets,"Still haven't finished Bojack. The show is awesome, but it just makes me feel like shit."
2021-04-20 23:20:01,wallstreetbets,"Mindhunter was fucking dope, but it would have come back if Fincher pushed hard, and he didn't"
2021-04-20 23:47:39,wallstreetbets,"Fincher said too expensive and too time consuming, also Netflix basically pulling the funding so they basically pulled the plug on them. Such a shame, it's probably one of the best show on Netflix"
2021-04-20 23:24:53,wallstreetbets,They also auctioned off all of the props.
2021-04-21 09:33:30,wallstreetbets,"As a viewer I already get bored, even after taking 1 1/2 months break for disney+ there is nothing new to watch on netflix..."
2021-04-21 07:44:13,wallstreetbets,Same here man. Cancelled after that and never looked back
2021-04-21 13:12:14,wallstreetbets,"Wow, imagine when you have children."

2021-04-21 14:08:39,wallstreetbets,"People have been saying forever that the long term success of netflix will depend on original content 

They are basically just too big and too rich to fail at this point. They throw money at EVERYTHING"
2021-04-21 11:23:31,wallstreetbets,"yes, that‚Äôs why you have it. We in the states dont anymore"
2021-04-21 10:54:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah sure ‚Äúfree‚Äù twitch prime at the cost of phone number data which i dont want to give out, amazon is absolute cancer"
2021-04-20 21:26:07,wallstreetbets,netflix releasing a movie a week = bunch of C rated movies
2021-04-20 20:49:54,wallstreetbets,They dont release GOOD shit. They definitely release things....it‚Äôs just all god awful now. I remember when a Netflix original used to actually mean something.
2021-04-21 13:19:41,wallstreetbets,So it's working?
2021-04-20 23:24:25,wallstreetbets,"He pushed hard for it. He told them they needed to let him start production ASAP or he was going to do other projects.

2021-04-21 09:46:26,wallstreetbets,That show was literally in a category of its own. Up there with House of Cards as best content on Netflix.

2021-04-21 03:12:33,wallstreetbets,Agreed
2021-04-20 22:53:03,wallstreetbets,"FANG was coined in ~2013. Ballmer was still at msft, and had hovered between 25-30 for a decade. Netflix on the other hand was new, fresh, and ripping."
2021-04-20 20:34:20,wallstreetbets,MSFT is boomer tier not nu-tech

2021-04-21 13:16:27,wallstreetbets,"A lot of the netflix original series not made in the US are solid still. Terrance House, Lupin, etc."
2021-04-20 23:31:38,wallstreetbets,Ahhhhh
2021-04-21 11:38:45,wallstreetbets,"AFAIK Fincher himself said he don't want to do it as of right now since he has Dune coming up, so he probably won't care much right now"
2021-04-21 00:07:26,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs common at the end of a season of a show or not, but it looks bad from an outside perspective."
2021-04-21 16:08:18,wallstreetbets,"That's usually how it goes, a movie is made and people watch it. Then ofc that it's a French pretty fucked up movie is another thing, I'm not really surprised it's French even though I've not seen it (I don't like foreign and subtitles) but yeah."
2021-04-20 23:45:18,wallstreetbets,"Not trying to be nit picky, legitimately asking. Was it FANG (no apple assumedly) at first or FAANG from the beginning. And what hovered between 25-30? I heard the term for the first time this year (ik ik way behind) so i was curious."
2021-04-20 22:36:28,wallstreetbets,"Msft didn't get much of a bounce from their 22 billion dollar vr deal with the army. It's so much bigger than the money, it will help msft go heavy into vr tech for gaming as well"
2021-04-20 22:41:14,wallstreetbets,"AAPL is boomer tier too then. It's only 1 year younger than microsoft, and I like Gates better than Jobs."
2021-04-21 00:30:40,wallstreetbets,"It's common practice in general, usually. For movies and TV shows both, it's just something to get rid off instead of destroying it or letting it sit in storage somewhere. 

I don't know to what extent they've auctioned stuff off though. But it's definitely not far from the norm."
2021-04-21 01:20:27,wallstreetbets,"It was FAANG. Amazon was starting to catch AWS speed around 2013, Apple was on iPhone 4-5, Netflix was just off DVD to streaming, Google hadn't cancelled its 70th beta product yet. Noone knew Facebook was going to elect Trump."
2021-04-20 23:12:37,wallstreetbets,Jobs has been dead for a hit minute. Soooo...
2021-04-21 13:29:21,wallstreetbets,"You aren't wrong; apple is boomer as fuck too 

It is fasion tech and they haven't come out with anything groundbreaking since the original iphone in 2007"

But then you got your kangs, Chuck. And all the kangs want is for your life savings you spent on AAPL weeklies to do fuck all. So bears may get mad at bulls once in a while because, bears get fucked by bulls. But bulls also fuck kangs, Chuck. And if they didn't fuck the kangs, you know what you'd get? You'd get your calls and your puts all covered in shit!

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **92.70** which gives us a total value of:

#$927,000

Susquehanna is THE NO.1 largest owner of CLOV, who has about $20M and DOUBLE that in GME.  Why would they want to sabotage their larger GME position with a ""distraction"".

It's safe to say that I have tasted every variation of my cum, sour, sweet, FUCKING RANCID, etc.

If I was 12 years old and i've masturbated on average at least once a day since then and i'm now 21 yo, i've consumed my own cum at least 2,920 times.

It is said that on average men ejaculate 1/4 to 1 teaspoon, so let's say I consistently pull 1/2 a teaspoon. Tbh that sounds a bit weak. A fucking teaspoon? I'll have to test that out some time.

The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful‚Ä¶ the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.

2021-04-21 02:39:08,wallstreetbets,It's usually never one factor that goes into consideration. Dad Bod + Poor = No. Dad Bod + Average Money = May be. Dad Bod + Avg Money + Ugly face = No. Dad Bod + Money + Good facial features = Yes. See? It's a function of multiple factors with weights given to each.

2021-04-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Short Sellers Never Learn - They're Doubling Down on CLOV (DD) At this point, seems a lot of people know about CLOV. Just so happens that the catalyst was a data error, but the opportunity is still quite strong even though the short interest isn't 144% of float. After all, it's now estimated at over 43%, making CLOV still one of the most shorted stocks in the entire market (if not THE most shorted stock).

Now, I actually bought into this at $7 several weeks ago. I first became aware of CLOV in the midst of the January hype, but I don't like buying high, so I stayed away. Came back a few weeks later and started watching for bullish signs as it dropped, saw that sweeeet solid bounce happening after tapping $6.50, and bought in around $7 myself.

https://preview.redd.it/5v5jbsepycu61.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=8804c928fbb1e9bcff4269a4808a906c2ff376bb

A few reasons for this initial bullishness from that point:

* I think the ""DOJ Investigation"" accusations are a bunch of hogwash and were causing a temporary and factually empty hammering of the stock.
* The average price target among analysts was at something like $13.50 at the time, with no analysts labeling it a sell. That is super promising for long-term holds.
* The market opportunity itself. CLOV is one of those ""will make it big or will die trying"" kind of stocks. I think they can make it in the space, but it's uncertain enough to give fuel to detractors, keeping the price down until their results start showing.
* The continued support shown around $7 weeks later just confirmed my bias, so I was watching closely to add to my position at the first sign of bullishness.

https://preview.redd.it/ebpjsdb00du61.png?width=198&format=png&auto=webp&s=f114a359f0333b9f693cdcffefe1aee139e748d1

Needless to say, seemed like a home run, a nice value opportunity for a long-term hold. Then, I became aware of the short interest.

Friday I saw my position exploding and had to look into why. Saw the 144% short interest report and increased my position by like 10x. This was no longer just a buy and hold for a high long-term gain, but could really explode up quickly! Turns out, the short interest wasn't quite accurate. But, ironically, this inaccurate short interest report actually did result from CLOV going from a top 10 short interest stock to quite possibly THE most shorted stock on the market in terms of float. Here's where it stands now according to Ortex. 

https://preview.redd.it/g7oobj1tqdu61.png?width=331&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa2960f93772aaee400260dc35a6fcd12df4da54

With a 90% util rate, just about every share even available to be lent for shorts is taken up at this point. Shorts have basically maxed out their position, making up about 43% of the technical float. 

However, a large portion of the float is not actually ""available"". Given the information available on their most recent 10-K, it appears that roughly 87 million shares are owned by insiders/controlling investors. This leaves less than 60 million shares actually available for the ""real"" available float. This is likely why the util rate is at 90% despite less than half of the shares being on loan. We're at an ""effective"" short interest of roughly 75% and rising.

Y'all, I liked this stock before this whole thing, but now I love it. This is a pretty unique opportunity to squeeze some shorts. I don't want to say it's the ""next GME"", because obviously GME actually was shorted all the way past 100% of float and was a turnaround story itself. GME also took a super long time to actually take off and make that squeeze happen. I was in GME in Feb and March of 2020 and actually had sadly taken out my money when the stock hit like $24 in Dec (I never imagined it might go into the $40s, much less $400+).

I don't see this as a ""turnaround story"" so much as a stock that has been massively underestimated by the market due to some hammering of Chamath and general SPAC distaste. For me, this is a value play that's been enhanced by the potential for a pretty massive short squeeze.

Full disclosure, I currently hold:

* 300 shares
* One 21 May 7.5 C
* One 18 Jun 7 C
* One 20 Aug 12.5 C

I'm also waiting on a deposit to clear, with which I plan to purchase a LEAP. I may roll my May call into something with a later expiry as well given how hard it can be to time these things.

P.S. To top it all off, I'm a giant fan of the Wyckoff Method. The daily chart looks like a great Wyckoff setup right now, with today's pullback to the neckline area providing a promising potential LPS."
2021-04-20 23:17:26,wallstreetbets,I like the stock. Currently holding 300 shares. Buying more premarket. Rolling my calls out to June. Questrade just updated borrow rate to 5.29%

 The company's Clover Assistant software is what sets it apart. It provides data-based, personalized insights for patients, and puts the information into physicians' hands at the point of care. Theoretically, this should improve decision-making by reducing variability, leading to better, lower-cost outcomes. An example is the company's readmission risk model. If Clover's software has forecast that a patient is a high risk for a costly return after being discharged from the hospital, caregivers can set up interventions like home health, telemedicine check-ins, and prescription delivery to address the issues that would typically lead to a readmission or emergency room visit.

If no squeeze forms, I'll just exit my options, hold my shares for the long run, and ride the growth of this company over the years."

2021-04-21 11:59:19,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree with you, but it's pretty clear that chamath became the face of spacs. And a lot of the old time wall street types have a disdain for spacs, retail, and anything else that goes against their way of doing things.

2021-04-21 00:49:41,wallstreetbets,SPY has been on a downward trend and things are falling. It fell 13% just today. I'm just saying theta can wreck those pretty fucking quick if it falls even 10%
2021-04-20 21:14:08,wallstreetbets,"If the short squeeze happens, you probably want to take at least partial profits and then repurchase for long-term holds when the squeeze subsides.

The whole reason a short-squeeze happens is because shorts have to buy shares to pay back their debts, so a lot of time those shares will be resold/dumped very shortly after they're bought up to cover short positions.

So like GME will never probably be actually ""worth"" $400 a share. The ""real value"" of the company is something like $30-$40 a share. So someone could have sold and made solid gains any of the way up and if they wanted to they could buy back in for the long run if/when it ever returns to true value prices.

If we see a squeeze, I'll scale out of my positions piece by piece and then look to purchase for the long run if it ever comes back down. That's what I did with AMC. I sold one option when the stock was at like $14, another at $12, and the last at $9. And I held a few stocks for the long run that I purchased at $10 (before more dilution was announced)."
2021-04-21 00:29:56,wallstreetbets,CLOV in this thread.
2021-04-21 00:12:12,wallstreetbets,"Man, I just don't see how they would have gotten out so quickly. And I would think we wouldn't be seeing new shorts being added in so significantly if they got out.

But what I like about this is that I like the stock even without the squeeze. No squeeze and it's still likely to gain 40% or more within a year, and many more times than that over several years. It's kind of like how I bought into GME in the single digits last year. I did that because I saw the turnaround happening. I didn't even know how incredibly a short/gamma squeeze could work out back then. Lol."

2021-04-20 20:55:38,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, this DD is barebones at minimum, with the entire thesis riding on the fact that it has an apparent 75% float.

Just look at r/clov, sort by all-time top post, and click the top three posters. All accounts made this year, all have one post, and its clov.

Real DDs have people calling the DD OP a fucking retard, while posts for CLOV have more positive sentiment than GME.

It doesn't matter though, I don't think I would have much empathy for those falling to CLOV"

2021-04-21 00:20:00,wallstreetbets,"I agree I do like the stock after reading about what they do, it‚Äôs a great software assistant.  

I just have had thoughts that market makers could somehow minimize the effects of a short squeeze if they coordinated together (with a fund that needed help..) Obviously illegal but shady shit happens and what if some asshole funds DID get deep underwater here?  It definitely doesn‚Äôt make sense in the price action we‚Äôve seen, so maybe we see more squeeze/ covering action by Friday.  Otherwise I‚Äôd wait for the news on DOJ catalyst & earnings catalyst.  

Otherwise yeah I imagine it will slowly rise to the 15$ price target and certainly reach 30$ end of year."

Its unrealistic to think only one ""GME"" can be happening at the same time, and in theory working against a hedge fund is a up hill battle. They have the funds to do things like you're claiming right. Nobody is saying pull out of GME and if they are then yeah they probably are being paid.  


But Publicity like mainstream media news attraction is going to bring in new people who are looking for something like GME.  


As for it not being stupid, it is simply cause it wouldnt take alot of effort to just make an alt account, and come preaching to self proclaimed retards, would it?

2021-04-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Credit Suisse (CS) Investors Are Overreacting to Greensill and Archegos Disclaimer: If you‚Äôre here for rocket emojis and short squeezes, move along. I‚Äôm not going to be offering any certainty here, nor am I going to tell you exactly how to play CS. That said, if you‚Äôre going to stick around, I hope you enjoy!

To understand what‚Äôs going on with Credit Suisse right now, we have to first discuss two major events that happened in the financial world since the last quarterly report: The collapse of Greensill and Archegos.

Greensill Capital was a supply chain financial services company that made money in three ways:

* Reverse factoring^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_finance)
* Factoring^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_\(finance\))
* Future accounts receivables finance^[3](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivablefinancing.asp)

Future accounts receivables finance tends to be especially risky since the lender is essentially issuing a loan to the lendee against collateral that the lendee has been promised from another party but has not yet received. However, Greensill may have actually taken this one step further and issued loans with collateral being money the lendee was predicted to be promised but had not yet actually been promised.

In July of 2020, one of Greensill‚Äôs insurers, Tokio Marine, discovered that a Tokio Marine employee had broken internal risk management limits in some way while insuring Greensill Capital (I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs directly related to the aggressive future accounts receivables financing practices, but I don‚Äôt have any evidence or sources to back this up). In response, Tokio Marine ceased insuring Greensill, leaving $4.8 billion of working capital uninsured. Greensill attempted to get an extension of coverage but failed and was forced to look for a new insurer. The problem was that no one wanted to insure them. On March 1st, 2021, after eight months of having billions of uninsured working capital and even more default insurance that expired over that previous weekend, Credit Suisse began freezing supply-chain investment funds in Greensill. That very same day, Greensill began filing for insolvency, and insolvency protection was granted on the 8th of March. I‚Äôll skip the boring stuff, but Credit Suisse‚Äôs loss is estimated to be roughly $3 billion. I don‚Äôt know exactly how much of that is going to hit CS directly vs. their clients, but needless to say, it won‚Äôt be pretty either way.

Now let‚Äôs talk about Archegos.

Archegos was a family office that imploded in March of 2021. In order to understand what happened, you need to first understand what a Total Return Swap is.^[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_return_swap) Essentially (and this is simplified), a TRS allows you to ask the bank to hold a stock for you and pay you any appreciation or dividends, and you pay them a fixed (or sometimes variable) rate in return. This allows you to benefit from a share of a stock as if you held it yourself, but without having to actually own it. Because you don‚Äôt own the stock yourself with a TRS, Archegos was able to get a metric fuckton of loans without reporting their ViacomCBS (VIAC) and Discovery (DISCA) positions, thereby deceiving the loaners as to just how exposed and heavily leveraged they were on highly volatile positions.^[5](https://youtu.be/58Sx26Gt6H8) They did this for several major banks, namely Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Nomura Holdings. Archegos was margin-called due to a large, synchronized ~27% drop in both VIAC and DISCA. Several large banks began liquidating Archegos‚Äôs TRS positions at roughly the same time in response (remember, the banks held these stocks, not Archegos themselves). This resulted in an additional 27% drop. Certain banks were able to get out faster than others, but CS and Nomura were especially slow to act.

So, what was the result of all of this? All-in-all, Archegos is expected to cost Credit Suisse somewhere in the ballpark of $4.7 billion.^[6](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/trading-update-202104.html) That figure is not expected to increase meaningfully as new information comes out.^[7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-question-credit-suisse-over-recent-archegos-related-stock-sales-11618934842) This $4.7 billion is in addition to the $3 billion loss from Greensill, bringing the final loss for Credit Suisse to somewhere in the ballpark of $7.7 billion in a single quarter. This is 95% of CS's total operating income (profit) for the past three years.

So, with all of these big, scary numbers, why am I still bullish?

Simply put, their balance sheet doesn‚Äôt justify the hit Credit Suisse‚Äôs stock took. CS had $805.8 billion in assets, $139.1 billion (17.3%) of that in cash alone as of December 31st, 2020.^[8](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/balance-sheet?p=CS) A $7.7 billion loss is only 0.95% of assets and 5.5% of cash ‚Äì they could eat this loss almost 18 times and wouldn‚Äôt have to liquidate a single non-cash asset. The loss as compared to equity ($65.3 billion) is significantly bigger, constituting an 11.7% hit after subtracting liabilities. However, this, in my opinion, does not justify the ~30% hit the stock has taken.^[9](https://i.imgur.com/QZmciLp.png) To build on this, their price to book ratio was 0.56 as of five days ago^[10](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/key-statistics?p=CS), which also indicates CS is a strong value investment, Book value is sitting at $17.74 but the current price is only $10.30, meaning there is at least 72% upside, although that is probably unrealistic in the short and medium terms.

As if this wasn‚Äôt enough, Credit Suisse has been in business since 1856, and it will take a lot more than a $7.7 billion loss to bring a financial giant like this to its knees. In fact, they are even named as one of the Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI),^[11](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_131111.pdf) They are, quite literally (and by definition), too big to fail. The responsible executives have also been removed^[12](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/changes-in-the-exb-credit-suisse-ch-202104.html) which shows they are going to be taking their risk management far more seriously in the future. Loss prevention on this scale will probably not happen again for some time because this loss is going to be at the forefront of their minds for a while.

How can this play go wrong then? Well, in the long-term, I‚Äôm fairly confident I‚Äôm right and that the market is overreacting to Greensill and Archegos. It did wipe about three years of profit from the balance sheet, but financially, the company is in a pretty solid place regardless. The more important variable is how it affected client trust, which will be difficult to gauge. I think there are fundamentally too many positive forces holding CS up to allow it to fall, but the current price reflects an overly bearish scenario. People are comparing Archegos to Longterm Capital Management when that is simply not the case. LTCM ended up leveraging themselves to the tune of $1.25 trillion while Archegos lost somewhere in the ballpark of $10-$20 billion with VIAC and DISCA. That said, CS certainly has the opportunity to go south in the short term. CS reports Q1 results on April 22nd, two days from now^[13](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/events/calendar.html) and, especially considering the market‚Äôs behavior over the past several days, I think it‚Äôs possible that investors will panic after listening to the earnings call. They may overestimate the damage, sell in fear, and cause the stock to drop even further. The reality is that this bank is not going anywhere. CS is going to be around in 5-10 years no matter what, yet the current pricing feels like investors expect doomsday on April 22nd. The second scenario is that the earnings call inspires confidence, although I personally this is less likely due to the fact that this did wipe out three years of profit. In this scenario, the best-case scenario I can realistically see happening is CS trading sideways, since some people are going to sell anyway. If it does dip, I‚Äôm hoping to pick up as many of those shares as possible.

I want to be clear that I still very much have questions about how the fine details are going to work when it comes to the loss‚Äôs interaction with Credit Suisse‚Äôs balance sheet. I am not quite sure what amount of the damage is going to hit CS‚Äôs clients vs. falling directly on Credit Suisse. The answer to that question is very relevant, yet I have not been able to find a clear answer. I also do not know for sure what the post-earnings reaction will be. My guess is just that: a guess. Also, if I‚Äôm missing or misanalyzing this, please do call me out as I genuinely want this to be the highest quality DD possible. Thanks for reading to the end!

Edit: I'm aware GS and MS destroyed CS here - hell, I spent the past week reading about it. I believe in the American banks for more, I just think CS stock is pricing in a hellfire scenario.

Edit 2: The Q1 report has gone live and can be found [here](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/quarterly-interim-reports/quarterly-results.html). I wasn't too surprised with most of the presentation, although I would definitely have liked to see less use of ""adjusted"" and ""excluding significant items"" in the financial reports. I do stand by my long-term thesis that CS's present valuation is excessively bearish, as well as my short-term thesis that the stock will likely not do too well in the coming months. I also want to clarify that this post was not trying to convince people that these two events weren't big deals - I did a fuckton of research on it for a week straight, I know it's a big deal. I think people were interpreting my post as optimistic for the short term when that is absolutely not the case. **I do not believe CS is going to do well in the short term.** When I say long-term, I mean long-term. This is a play that will likely take several years to pay off."
2021-04-20 22:47:15,wallstreetbets,"I think you‚Äôre very wrong about this one. These are 2 gigantic errors in a long list. People are trading on the overall incompetence of CS and the likelihood of another major bust in the near future. 

Banks like CS have very strict capital requirements. So we can‚Äôt look at $7 billion and say that‚Äôs a drop on the bucket compared to what they have on hand. Another issue like Archegos would mean they have to raise more capital... Ruh Roh! 

Especially considering the recent market corrections, I have bet that CS is in for another huge dip and might even signal the need to raise capital in the next 1-2 weeks. 

Positions: PUTS! 50 May 21 $9 strike, 50 June 18 $8 strike"
2021-04-20 21:32:33,wallstreetbets,This is a very through DD based off of ‚Äúinitial observations‚Äù (not try to be smug and say you didn‚Äôt research the subject). That being said we don‚Äôt know how badly risk management screwed up in general. As other posters have stated this could very well be just a crack beginning to show. I believe the concern is here probably somewhere between catching a falling dagger and full blown Bear Sterns.
2021-04-21 00:44:41,wallstreetbets,"Their share price has dropped ~20% during the blowup. That works out to about 4.5B loss which is less then the actual loss to shareholder value of 7.7B

Either the stock was undervalued before the blowup or is currently overvalued. 

With risk of more archegos like events happening I'm leaning towards overvalued."
2021-04-21 00:46:10,wallstreetbets,"I did  exactly the same thing with LYG last fall.   

Dont drop your full nut on it.  It will probably retrace to fill he daily gap when they have their earnings call - but will most likely chop for quite a long time before slow climbing back. 

Or it will fail its ECBS and either get bailed out or die."
2021-04-21 16:04:56,wallstreetbets,How can it be that CS has 806 billion in assets if the market cap is less than 30 billion? These assets don‚Äôt belong to the shareholders I guess and they can‚Äôt access them so easily.
2021-04-20 22:03:05,wallstreetbets,"This is why investors are bailing, they fear it's just the beginning. That said, likely a reasonable time to buy if it was isolated, but I doubt it personally."
2021-04-20 23:28:56,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I didn‚Äôt make it clear but short-term I‚Äôm bearish as well. I‚Äôm saying this play is more on the time scale of three-five years."
2021-04-20 23:25:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that‚Äôs kinda the core assumption of this DD. If this sort of thing keeps on happening, I will be the first to admit CS is absolutely fucked. I have no allegiance to this stock, and was more aiming to put this out there to see what other people thought."

2021-04-21 06:53:51,wallstreetbets,Dude clove has been declining since the beginning of the year. Meaning anyone who took out shorts is in the money most likely. Profit/loss ratios on shorted stock trigger squeezes. If they can afford the borrow fees because they borrowed high they can afford to cover much slower. Creating a lack luster squeeze. ASO is a much better play as an alt to gme or amc if thats what you‚Äôre looking for.

All this hype about new leadership and a new strategy. Yeah they're planning to sell online. But what are they going to sell? Playstation and Xbox are already making all their games exclusive. So the Xbox and Playstation games that Gamestop relied on for the majority of its revenue are out. That leaves PC games... and computer parts and merchandise?

they have been vetted by the literal reddit mods, who can see EVERYTHING these guys do publicly.

It was only that low because HFs shorted it like crazy to get it to that price.  With Ryan Cohen as the new board Chairman and the company making lots of changes to enter the ecommerce sector(no longer just retail), the valuation for this sector is low.  Yes, it is speculative, but if they have even a modicum of success turning around the company, there is no way it will fall below the current share price for very long, and $500 per share would be an average market cap for this sector.    


""I'm new to stocks, and really just trying to understand the situation""

2021-04-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"George Floyd Play of the Century Listen up retards, we have the absolute play of the century on our hands.

I've been playing very close attention to the George Floyd trial, and anyone with a brain can tell that this Chauvin guy is probably going to get off. Regardless of how you feel about that, there is an opportunity to make massive amounts of money.

Everyone here except maybe the 7+ million members who joined since June 2020 remembers the [massive protests that took place](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/06/us/us-george-floyd-protests-saturday/index.html) when that event first went down. These protests largely started out peaceful, but many escalated into violence targeting local businesses. One of the most targeted businesses during these events was CVS (ticker $CVS). [CVS got his so hard they were forced to close some locations!!!](https://www.businessinsider.com/cvs-closes-some-stores-looting-protests-2020-6) Let's look at what happened to CVS stock over the same period of time:

&#x200B;

[See that Drop???](https://preview.redd.it/jr83oz706du61.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=a464465a4ed3279cac2c39dfd8063576aa82dcd6)

You guys see that drop??? CVS dropped 10% in a couple of weeks right when all this was going on! So what does this have to do with the trial??? By my estimations, the outcry from an acquittal will be roughly 10 times larger than what happened in June 2020. Doing some napkin math here, 10 times of 10% is 100%!!! Meaning if Chauvin is acquitted, CVS will be going all the way down to $0/share!!! The market is clearly not pricing this in, as CVS is currently trading at about $76/share, $76 more than it is actually worth.

With a verdict expected by the end of May, there is still time to get in on this once in a lifetime trade!!! I only wish I had enough capital to make (almost) unlimited gains on this play.

Edit: Positions. Short $10k shares of $CVS

I'm just wondering how you came to that conclusion. I've been listening to the trial as well and I thought the guy was fucked (and rightfully so) after the defense's weak ass attempt to say he died from his heart condition. On the prosecution side you've got the medical examiner, a few medical professionals saying the opposite, witness testimony (especially the EMT's), and Chauvin's own ex-boss saying he went way over the line and did not represent the values of their police force."

2021-04-20 22:34:22,wallstreetbets,Well he didn't get off. So where does that leave this plan?
2021-04-20 23:33:59,wallstreetbets,He... he did not get off.
2021-04-20 23:34:26,wallstreetbets,Well this aged poorly
2021-04-21 09:30:29,wallstreetbets,Ya right if he got off there would be literal murder in the streets. Fun fact 2 hours before the verdict they was a shooting in a supermarket  2 people were killed. I‚Äôm guessing that was a warning of things to come.
2021-04-21 09:53:36,wallstreetbets,I knew he would be convicted
2021-04-21 11:32:14,wallstreetbets,"> You guys see that drop??? CVS dropped 10% in a couple of weeks right when all this was going on!

They spiked right back up after when the insurance payouts started to pour in.  Besides, no self-respecting retard would invest in anything but GME.

2021-04-21 08:09:08,wallstreetbets,Wow. Shity idea. Also an incorrect prediction. You're a horrible human being
2021-04-20 21:40:26,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't be surprised of riots this summer again though cops kill a black guy ever week like they do it on purpose.
2021-04-21 10:43:12,wallstreetbets,Does anyone know any cops that we could convince to George Floyd a few fuckers to help this along?
2021-04-20 20:21:33,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry OP, as apes will Burn Loot and Murder either way."

You could start from scratch again before sentencing gets announced in 8 weeks. Could still be unsatisfactory to the public and riots could break out."
2021-04-21 11:30:13,wallstreetbets,Play of the century would be attaching the SAFE act to the George Floyd bill and watching every weed stock blast off.
2021-04-21 11:30:41,wallstreetbets,Im in. Shorted the stock with my third mortage from gamestop stonks. Les go down boiis down to earth we go

Edit: And with the pandemic winding down, they are likely going to deflate. I think a realistic expectation is \~40 when vaccines die down, and if Chauvin gets acquitted / Brooklyn Girl gets a lighter sentence."
2021-04-20 23:34:42,wallstreetbets,"Tbh you‚Äôre still in there. Chauvin will get appeal and get off due to what Waters said. You might not be wrong , just an appeal trial early üòÇ"

Just look at their share prices through last summer. Then when the protests and rioting stopped in the late fall, a flat or downward trend since."

2021-04-21 01:51:31,wallstreetbets,I was gonna say that I've never paid $20 to have a garbanzo bean on my face. Your answer is valid to tho.
2021-04-21 09:23:58,wallstreetbets,Hit it right on the nose.. who the hell thought he was going to get off
2021-04-21 12:29:18,wallstreetbets,"Yes but OP didn‚Äôt lose anything trying (he was wrong, stock doesn‚Äôt move he can buy back at same price). Its a good way to make money, betting on rare events that have a non-zero probability but are priced-in at zero. You need a lot of those opportunities though because it can take lot of tries for one of those rare events to happen."
2021-04-21 11:08:21,wallstreetbets,"If you only look at the cases presented, he had good odds of getting off. What OP forgot was the human factor- specifically, that the jury knew that Mad Maxine and her army of protestors would burn multiple cities to the ground and had already started threatening witnesses for the defense.

The judge even told Nelson he had likely grounds for a mistrial because of it, if he could find a judge suicidal enough to make that ruling."
2021-04-21 04:00:12,wallstreetbets,While you're pretty bad at predicting court outcomes I think the plan was still worth a shot. You miss all the shots you don't take

2021-04-20 23:12:59,wallstreetbets,Exactly.  CVS would have been at $0 tomorrow AM and he would have nothing to show for it besides this DD.

They're clearly spending $$ on S&M to attract new users but they could be profitable if they wanted to today! Clearly a very unique business model caught up in a temporary sentiment shift. Don't get a big head now ‚Äî you've already won! Risk/reward is against you here."
2021-04-21 10:53:08,wallstreetbets," Yes, I have. They aren't going to 0 in the near-term due to the SPAC cash and recent equity sale, but it will happen. It's always also great to see Harry Sloan somehow sell his entire stake in SKLZ yet, still maintain a $150M stake in Draftkings. Look out also for when the quarterly share lock-up begins to expire in mid-June.

No they could not. I did not even mention their funny accounting regarding their use of bonus cash, which they use as a lever to drive additional revenue whenever they want to meet analyst expectations. Ever see that $10 bonus for a $10 deposit? Well SKLZ takes a portion of the $10 bonus cash they offer as part of their rake, aka their revenue. It is shady accounting if you are generating revenue without real economic substance, in other words, you're not really generating any real cash but jsut round-tripping your own cash to add more revenue. When this gets restated, let's see how much growth they really have!"
2021-04-21 11:54:14,wallstreetbets,"Time will tell but in the meantime, short squeeeeeeze üôÇ"
2021-04-21 11:44:19,wallstreetbets,"They don‚Äôt use bonus cash in their revenue, but okay. Keep reading short reports and thinking they‚Äôre true. It‚Äôll get you far"
2021-04-21 11:57:55,wallstreetbets,Funny - for your name you really don't like stocks with FCF
2021-04-21 11:49:58,wallstreetbets,"Yes, keep going on about how they don't use bonus cash in their revenue:

"" Generally, end-users are required to deposit funds into their Skillz account in order to be eligible to participate in games for prizes. As part of its monetization services, Skillz is responsible for processing all end-user payments, billings and settlements on behalf of the game developer, such that the game developer does not have to collect directly from or make payments directly to the end-users. **When the end-users enter into cash games, the end-users pay an entry fee using cash deposits, prior cash winnings in the end-users‚Äô accounts that have not been withdrawn, and end-user incentives (specifically Bonus Cash).** **Skillz recognizes revenue related to each game regardless of how entry fees are paid****.** Skillz is responsible for distributing the prize money to the winner on behalf of the game developer. Skillz typically withholds 16%‚Äâ‚Äì‚Äâ20% of the total entry fees when distributing the prize money as a commission. That commission is shared between Skillz and the game developers; however, the game developers‚Äô share is calculated solely based upon entry fees paid by net cash deposits received from end-users, adjusted for certain costs incurred by Skillz to provide monetization services. """
2021-04-21 12:02:02,wallstreetbets,"Investing is not about the past, it's about the future. Based on my analysis SKLZ is a screaming buy here so I'm not worried about this perfect storm of bad news. They will generate plenty of FCF in the future. I'm in this for the next 3-5 years unless there's poor execution or bad management decisions. 

Best of luck ‚Äî in the long run business fundamentals drive stock prices."
2021-04-21 12:00:33,wallstreetbets,Is that from the short report? Or from Skillz?
2021-04-21 12:03:54,wallstreetbets,Straight from the latest 10-K. Search it on EDGAR
2021-04-21 12:09:20,wallstreetbets,"They also recognize all bonus cash in their system as marketing and advertising costs so it would make sense to count it as revenue when that bonus cash is used in the game, right?"
2021-04-21 13:39:48,wallstreetbets,"It's supposed to be categorized as contra-revenue and netted out, similar to returns, allowances, and discounts, the latter of which it is most similar to. Imagine if Apple offered a 50% discount on all their products - imagine their sales number! But oh wait, they economically only benefited from the 50% that customers paid"
2021-04-21 13:44:09,wallstreetbets,"You can‚Äôt compare that to this. If Apple gave you $200 cash back when you bought a new $1,000 iPhone it would count as $1,000 revenue then the $200 would be marketing and advertising expense."
2021-04-21 13:59:11,wallstreetbets,"You can't even google what contra-revenue is? Here, I even wasted some extra time to pull up how Apple reconciles its net sales:

"" The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and **other customer incentive programs** based on the Company‚Äôs expectations and historical experience. ""

It gives me great comfort to know that people like you are on the other side of my trade. I already stated my position - let's see what happens in the next year"
2021-04-21 19:56:45,wallstreetbets,How‚Äôs that short position looking now bruh?
2021-04-21 14:04:53,wallstreetbets,"Either way Skillz takes 20% from each game that‚Äôs played. Whether it‚Äôs bonus cash or real cash isn‚Äôt relevant. Most players need to deposit real cash to get the bonus cash. Bonus cash can‚Äôt be withdrawn, and any bonus cash in your account is forfeit when you withdraw. They‚Äôre gonna be huge. It‚Äôs only a matter of time."

A few bullet points for all y'all apes

* Cheapest e-commerce American platform on the market (accounting for market cap/sales)
* Americans in general more prone to spend money on frivolities given low interest rates and stimmy checks
* Huge demand of goods from China almost collapsed the supply chain. $WISH ships directly from China
* Rumor has it that Amazon offered 10B for WISH back in 2015 and CEO wouldn't sell (mkt cap is around 7B currently).
* CEO is an ex-Google employee
* Most downloaded play store app of 2018
* centralized hub for buying random/wacky shit
* Gamification of the buying experience makes users spend more on the platform
* The absolute apes at Loop capital have a $40 price target. The more trustworthy people over at evercore initiated recently with a price target of $22
* Exposure to international markets, not just the US
* You'd literally be buying @ an all time low valuation

No! Its actually an mRNA vaccination intended for inoculation of patients infected with Covid-19.

Estimates are reporting potentially $14B dollars in sales from the vaccines. Now, I'm no economist, but $14B in sales for a company with a market cap less than $70B is significant, right?

In any case, I'm betting MRNA trades above $200 in October of 2021.

**HOWEVER** I expect 2 things to happen this year:

1.  10s of billions in lawsuits for vaccine damage.  Short term drops, drop does not last as vaxx manufacturers have 0 liability, the lawsuits go to the VAERS monkey court and come from govt money if anything.

Manufacturers complained that they were getting sued out of existence with all the SIDS deaths and other problems from the TDaP vaccine and said they needed this protection or they would stop making vaccines.  The US Supreme Court ruled ""vaccines are unavoidably unsafe"" and created VAERS to shield them.  Not a coincidence that the vaccine schedule exploded from that point on.  Even the CDC's own studies confirm less than 1% of severe injuries even make it to the VAERS court for potential joke compensation."

2021-04-21 19:34:35,wallstreetbets,Yes! I actually work for one of the 2 companies at the moment and worked for the other a few years ago. That‚Äôs how they make a large portion of their money. They only hold on to some big money loans with borrowers who never miss payments cause the interest is bette than selling it to another company.
2021-04-20 20:20:04,wallstreetbets,How does this refute or help the point mentioned above?
2021-04-21 00:54:18,wallstreetbets,Then why did they do a round of loans before going public and just finished another round when only being public for like 2 months?

2021-04-21 07:47:15,wallstreetbets,Borrowing rates are super low. When borrowing rates are low you hold your cash. I did the same with my new truck. I could have paid cash but it made more sense to take out a loan with the loan rates. My cash can do more not tied up in an asset.
2021-04-21 04:17:14,wallstreetbets,Where did you get this information from?

RIDE got absolutely beaten down by Shorts, Hindenburg report, lawsuits, dropping out of a race, and the general collapse of the EV bubble. They're heavily shorted and hit all time lows twice this week.

But. 

None of the negative pressure really has anything to do with the fundamental product. They have a production facility, beta vehicles, and a race truck. Don't get me wrong! It's still going through testing so nothing is completely proven technology. The underlying tech has some major possible downsides and upsides. But again, none of the negative pressure has anything to do with it on a technical level besides some fear mongering with no data.

All time high of $30. Currently hit $8.80 today. 

If they produce this year or next (September is the goal) it'll definitely pass $30. It may pop off soon, but I'm in it until production or long term possibly. I'm especially waiting on their Camping World van announcement."

The Aussie - US trade treaty allows the same tax rates as though they were gains made in Australia as well, so all in all I much prefer trading in the US.   
Plus, I can wait until the USD is particularly strong before bringing to dosh back in to make more money on the exchange rate. 

Not quite your original point haha. 

I am looking into some US construction companies right now who might be benefiting from it though, so I might come back with more details."

2021-04-20 23:41:27,wallstreetbets,"what 'already gain'?  The only way you could even potentially have a gain is if you sold covered calls.  And even then that would have required you to buy at the absolute bottom last time.

2021-04-21 07:04:34,wallstreetbets,"Canfor seems so undervalued compared to the rest of sector. Op cites p/e 15-18 for above stocks in USA and in Canada e.g Stella-Jones has p/e 17.

2021-04-21 18:23:16,wallstreetbets,"I think low p/e is a good thing, it means the lumber boom is not priced in yet. It just makes me a bit paranoid, why competitors have the boom priced in but this one does not?

Either this is a jackpot that does easy 2-3x in next 6 months or I missed something. Given my track record I probably missed something :)"

Your construction case is also an extreme example. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve heard anyone speculate that lumber and building prices can remain elevated once the supply is remedied. There‚Äôs too much competition in the space.

The economy was expanding faster than the supply of gold, so an ounce of gold that you held on to would be worth more ten years later. One of the problems with deflation was that farmers would take out loans to buy land (to become farmers, that is), and then find themselves unable to earn enough money to pay back the loan. What was a reasonable amount had become a much scarcer quantity in the interim, and even selling their land and all their assets would not generate enough money to pay back the original loan. This led to a push for inflationary fiat currencies and the formation of the Greenback Party, which later morphed into the original ""Populists""."

1. gotta understand that the steak provider is a business too and it is passing on expenses to you the consumer, and since consumer demand has not died down, no reason why the prices shouldn't go up if they can maintain it. Its a two way street that needs to strike a balance.
2. What you need is sustenance, and not steak and definitely not access to cheap steak. So I believe everyone should also apply that spirit american spirit here, Steak too expensive? Tough shit, I gotta look for the best interest in me and am gonna get some cheap cut or change proteins. 

The price increase is also the same thing as a business saying ""This is america"". No one is gonna die if they eat half the amount of steak in a year like they did before.

The shrinkage/quality corner cutting has been ongoing as far back as I can remember. Taco Bell used to serve actual refried beans before they switched to the dehydrated bean powder back in the 90s. I still remember the switch and the dramatic difference in quality.

There's an interesting post on this which sounds like they changed a lot more than just beans over the years according to comments:

https://www.chowhound.com/post/taco-bell-pre-90s-good-notice-difference-751748?page=55

>JALBERT: In the initial stage of the pandemic, everyone kind of thought the sky was falling. In the industry, everyone thought housing was going to take a huge hit.

MORRIS: So some mills cut production, dropping supply by up to 30%. But right about then, demand took off.

MORRIS: First, the do-it-yourself home improvement boom took hold. Then crews started building more houses and using still more scarce lumber. Then the big second wave of COVID cases cut into production at U.S. lumber mills, and those mills are still running with fewer workers than they had before the pandemic. Now the building season is really kicking into high gear across most of the U.S., and the lumber shortage isn't the only thing driving up construction costs.

People can get their car cheaper by buying cash instead of financing. You can defer purchases and invest the money instead to make more. Very very few people do this.

People want things and they don't have the self control to wait for cheaper prices. Hell they can't even wait until they have the money to pay for it.  This is why so many Americans are underwater on vehicles. This is why so few save for retirement.

I get what you're saying. You might think that way. I might think that way. But we are in the extreme minority. Do a Google search for how much Americans have saved for retirement by age. Its frightening.

And if you want to get more philosophical, it violates a fundamental law of economics. If you reduce the price of a good or service people buy more. Multiply that by the entire economy. Imagine people having more discretionary income to spend."

Forget taking out a mortgage, or using leverage or credit.  Both of those things would be super cost prohibitive from a purchasing power prospective.  Anyone with a mortgage or a car loan would probably walk away from it since the payment you are making on the loan would be better tucked away and hidden.

House values would tank as people walk away from the market, forget about renting most landlords would walk away too, unless they are debt free.  So renting would be hard.  I suppose people could take to squatting in abandoned properties.

Imagine an economic environment where you get wealthier either way.  That's the problem you're describing.  It's not much of a problem if you ask me."
2021-04-21 15:15:31,wallstreetbets,The problem is we are in an everything bubble.  Inflation is rampant and interest rates are zero which means stocks and real estate go up.  No one knows where the fuck to put their money to not get fucked when it all comes down.
2021-04-20 20:56:40,wallstreetbets,"That lower prices lead to more consumption?  Every single model and theory of business.  Yeah you can get into the weeds where a higher priced product might offer more perceived value and actually sell more at an increased price point, but that only applies when a consumer is shopping between competing products.  And I'd argue somewhat limited circumstances.

But on the whole, this is even accepted in all major economic theories, just not in the same context.  When we talk government subsidies lower prices can encourage consumption and higher prices can discourage it.  And all the economic theories agree on this.  MMT, Keynes, and Austrians.

For some reason most theories function on a premise that if a consumer expects prices to fall further they wont make purchases today.  That may be true if they expect the price to fall by a knowable amount tomorrow.  But if that price decrease is going to fall an unknown amount in an unknown time frame, very very few consumers would be swayed by this.  What ill-conceived theories propose is that the majority of consumers are going to turn every single purchase they make into some sort of speculation on future deflation.  Just imagine the average person shopping for Christmas dinner ""I'm not sure if I should buy that turkey yet....might be cheaper next week"".  99% of people are buying the turkey to make sure they have it.

And of course they ignore the effects of supply and demand as prices fall.  As people are essentially richer and cost of living decreases they'd be disincentivized to work ie: able to retire earlier.  This would decrease economic output and serve to counterbalance the falling prices.  On the consumption side, consumers would be able to afford goods and services they previously couldn't and would be eager to indulge.

Just to prove how ridiculous this notion of a deflationary spiral is, humor me with this hypothetical.  If we did have a deflationary spiral and you could buy a yacht (pick your unrealistic indulgence) on a week's salary, would you?  Or would you wait until the price fell to an hour's pay?  Or would you wait longer and get it cheaper?  It's a hyperbolic example, but you see my point.  At some point you're spending that money and making purchases.  You're not waiting forever.

So the only thing indicating there could ever be some kind of deflationary spiral driving all prices to $0 is a bizarre notion that Americans (or people in general) as a whole have not just a modicum of self control, but absolute self control when it comes to personal finance.  As I already pointed out, there's an entire mountain range of evidence that says otherwise.  Yeah, some people save $5M for retirement on a $65k salary.  But it's far more common to make $300k and save nothing.  

The richest nation in the world is in debt up to their eyeballs.  The market has been on fire.  People could make a fortune if they deferred consumption and invested their discretionary income.  By and large they don't.  Why not?  Because that's not how the psychology of the consumer works.  Consumption today is preferred to consumption tomorrow."
2021-04-21 08:10:17,wallstreetbets,"> If you could buy a Ford Focus today, or wait 6 months and get the Cadillac.  If you didn't need it right away, you'd probably wait.

First of all, you're assuming people know this.  Neither deflation nor inflation work this way.  Yes, currently we assume prices will go up over time, but we don't know when and we don't know by how much.  That's how a deflationary environment would work.  Maybe that Caddy comes down to the price of a Focus in 6 months, maybe the Focus is only 5% off a year from now.

Second, I disagree with the premise that many people would do that.  Particularly if you're talking Americans and vehicles.  Americans can't wait until their current vehicle is paid off before they get something brand new.  I'm waiting for vehicle loan terms to cross the 10 year mark because I feel like that's coming.

> But you'll feel lucky that you were working for the unicorn debt free company and not one of the millions that got swallowed by their debts. 

I think you make a good point with debt in general, but I think it works against you.  Yes, the deleveraging phase would be incredibly painful.  But I'm personally not one of the people who thinks our current debt laden culture is a healthy.  I think the forced deleveraging would be good for us in the long term.

To some of your other points, I think it would be good to reduce the number of landlords and have more people own their own homes- particularly if they're more affordable.  Having your wages cut for ""good performance"" would be weird, but if the purchasing power increases, it's not bad.

People who purchased homes for $100k 20 years ago and are now worth $800k feel good about that.  Another $600k into their net worth.  But it's disasterous for people like me trying to get into the market.  So again, yes a bloodbath as housing de-levers, but overall if housing is more affordable, this is a good thing.  We even have government programs trying to attain affordable housing because it's such a crisis in some places."
2021-04-21 10:55:00,wallstreetbets,In my short time on earth what I have seen is after any recession we hit the boom and inflation cycle. If you were looking to make a purchase at the lower or bottom price well that‚Äôs gone.

2021-04-21 10:33:29,wallstreetbets,"I don't see deflation outpacing the market over a long period of time.  

Still, that's irrelevant because your wealth would grow either way.  This is the problem you're focusing on: people can increase wealth by holding cash or increase their wealth by less in the stock market.  It's not really a problem."
2021-04-21 10:36:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it really is a problem because it encourages hoarding money, which then leads to lack of investment, so it's a cycle that kills an economy."
2021-04-21 11:18:50,wallstreetbets,"I think you're still assuming people wouldn't want to spend and consume.  I just can't imagine that to be the case.  People want stuff.  And they don't want to wait to get that stuff.  This is why debt is so prevalent, sometimes even at high interest rates.  If you're going to cite a desire for cheaper prices as a motive to defer spending you have to also cite some objective point in time they'd be willing to spend because they will want their stuff eventually.  Is the theory that consumers will try to time a market bottom and go on a spending binge at the first sign of inflation?

And if people are still consuming then investments in production will be profitable in real terms and outpacing deflation.  Now if the cost of capital required to supply the demand gets too expensive, increasing costs, then I think we just proved it's not a self-reinforcing crisis."

2021-04-20 21:43:52,wallstreetbets,Are you suggesting I just buy and hold and wait for news? Maybe if you truly believe we're going to see news about tech in April that meets hype/expectation.  I have my doubts.
2021-04-21 12:12:43,wallstreetbets,Cramer wants you to stay away because he has HUGE SHORT POSITION!!! Duh. Called gme battleground when he shorted it and wasnt gojng his way .. he wants you to stay away... r e a d b e t w e e n the lines

2021-04-21 12:24:29,wallstreetbets,Misread - depending on your strike you might lose them haha. I recommend people not doing CCs on this - especially in April. Too many catalysts coming up. Imagine if they announce a BO....

2021-04-21 14:14:08,wallstreetbets,Yeah that‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve been thinking about that. But I think I‚Äôm also fine with with losing the shares if I sell CCs for a 10% premium every week for a strike 40-50% OTM and they get called. I still get 50-60% returns in a week in that scenario ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

SLGWF - in the next two years I expect it to at least be at a $1.00"
2021-04-20 20:43:36,wallstreetbets,Nok nok
2021-04-20 20:49:19,wallstreetbets,NOK will be $5 soon.

2021-04-20 23:18:26,wallstreetbets,Hahah nok nok

2021-04-20 22:25:45,wallstreetbets,"It's $NOK.  The needle never moves.   Someone here pointed out the $0.01 calls less than $0.50 OOM last month and I stupidly took that gamble.  They  are $0.01 because it literally has 0 volatility.  You would think it was paying a 50% dividend.

GME, possibly, is the only time in the history and possibly future of mankind where we can fight back in a meaningful way. You are just in it for the money. I'm in it for humanity. That is the difference between us. You are looking for a quick flip so you can make $$$ so you don't have to go work at Wendy's. I'm looking for changing humanity. You could care less about humanity. It's all about you. If you get your mansions and lambo and the rest of humanity burns you'd be just as happy as a billionaire raping a child. For you it is all about the money, for me it has almost nothing to do with the money. Just remember, one day you will die. One day you will laying in a bed struggling for that last breath and all the money in the world isn't going to save you. When I'm there I will be 100% content knowing that I wasn't a sell out and I tried my best to make the world a better place for all."

Basically she told me every single hedge fund does insider trading to some degree and they're cut throat against each other. Hearing about some of the shit they do is wild. They're constantly under investigation from SEC but they just sneak their way out of trouble by offering people there jobs. It's corrupt AF. She said they don't often short things. Equities aren't making them as much money as stuff like credit default swaps. They don't even trade options. It's just not profitable. The type of DD they do involves going to shipping ports and using drones to fly over the containers to see how many are in the port, to figure out what commodities to purchase and so forth. It's wild AF. Sounds like both an exciting place to work and a terrifying place to work all at the same time."

2021-04-20 21:44:48,wallstreetbets,"Since there is a ridiculous amount of copium in these comments...

BB does not know how to make money. They only way they increase revenue is with bad acquisitions they somehow manage to make margins worse on.

They keep making partnerships because they can't actually sell their stuff.

And IVY? They have to pretty much give it away on AWS because they don't know how to monetize the data.

The only thing they have going for them is QNX, but they make so little because of the margins on the devices that use QNX.

Until they change their leadership and figure out how to make money, this stock will stay in the dog house."

All in all, every time DD  comes up people focus on qnx as some beacon of light. It is worth noting that it is not. It is a 40y old company with ~350-400 employees depending on the day, and as the autonomous and intelligent car industry continues to grow, their competitors have more money to throw at eclipsing them.

They won‚Äôt fail, but they‚Äôre steady, and low earners, and they‚Äôre unlikely to show the exponential growth required for them to be BB‚Äôs saviour.

BB is overvalued, that‚Äôs why positive earnings reports and news in general still sees downticks.  It‚Äôs a 5$ stock, and a perfect example of a dinosaur that failed to adapt.

I might sound bleak, but as someone that has lived the Nortel and BB collapses, I‚Äôm just trying to save a few ppl from some serious loss porn. The company is not about to rally. It‚Äôs shit and has been for years.

Position: none, idk how long it‚Äôll take to die so I‚Äôm not comfortable to bet on it, steering clear...just see too many posts saying it‚Äôll rocket and try to give a heads up that it probably won‚Äôt.

Who knows maybe I‚Äôll be wrong, but history says I probably won‚Äôt be

My unofficial advise is to wait for the stock to get so cheap someone buys them out. They don‚Äôt have the ability to resurrect themselves.

They were late to the party and are under funded compared to their competitors. They won‚Äôt fare well.

Fwiw the ppl that decided to acquire QNX worked 5min down the road, so less brilliance, more old boys club.

you‚Äôre welcome to disagree and invest, I don‚Äôt have a crystal ball. But IMO Buying qnx is simply not enough to bump their stock no matter how well qnx does (and qnx is not set to do very well - they‚Äôre a journeyman company to the letter)

Im just here to remind ppl they‚Äôve been failing for over a decade now, so best of luck."

2021-04-21 02:10:42,wallstreetbets,"If it's shares, you haven't lost anything. As long as the company isn't swirling into the toilet, it's fine."
2021-04-20 20:21:32,wallstreetbets,"My answer probably isn't popular, but it's real.  Philosophy.  A realization that as a human being, my primary goal in life is to survive.  And realizing that... survival isn't hard.  Humans can eat very nearly anything.  And as long as you find enough food and water, and have shelter from the elements, you won't DIE.  And everything beyond that?  ALL of it, every last iota, is just gravy.  You can live without gravy.  You gain nothing by clinging desperately to those extras, and it often costs you a great deal.  For some, it costs them even their life.  

You're on the ride.  Enjoy it while it lasts.  Property may come and go, it's all a fiction anyway.  Naturally, the only objects which you can control are exactly those which you hold in your hands right now.  Everything beyond that requires the consent and cooperation of the society of humans around you to acknowledge and respect that your control fictitiously extends further.  Pretty cool of them to extend that to you, no?  And they could easily just kill you, but you've gone your whole life and no one has.  Likely no one has even tried, since it's fantastically easy to kill a person.  So the world ain't so bad.  You're surrounded by people who will let you live and probably won't steal all your stuff unless they are themselves forced into extreme desperation.  The question isn't ""Why relax?"", it's the inverse... why get stressed out?  Is it going to help?

When you realize the ""worst case scenario"" isn't unsurvivable, it frees you up to shoot for the stars, IMO."

2021-04-20 23:47:45,wallstreetbets,"Everybody is obsessed with PLTR‚Äôs ability to capture commercial business but their government contracting business is what will get this company to be profitable and grow to the valuations everybody hopes for in the quickest time frame possible.

There are currently many large scale military contracts floating around awarded to the likes of LMT/BA/NOC that focus on modernization and digital transformation of the DoD‚Äôs threat detection/assessment/response protocols. 

These are things like missle defense systems which rely on an enormous amount of real time data provided by thousands of sensors and satellites. The defense industry has also been undertaking efforts in the past few years to essentially automate threat response plans, using complex granular data inputs, such as the location of a threat (let‚Äôs say a missle launched towards the US), the nearest Air Force base, the type of fighters and weapons equipped at said base, amounts of fuel available in fighter jets, weather conditions/wind speeds, projected debris fields, etc and spit out a plan of action to best counter the threat. This is known as ‚Äúwar gaming‚Äù and has been an (re)emerging research area for the military industrial complex since Obama‚Äôs second term.  From demonstrations of the capabilities of software like Gotham, PLTR can essentially come in as a subcontractor to these programs and offer the software/data infrastructure to build apps upon; even if they are not selected as a prime contractor on these type of programs, it is big business playing second fiddle to the big 4 defense firms."

I think the theory is that you have your longs and shorts and they create an equilibrium. 

What we are all seeing is that taken to an extreme where the HFs are jacked on coke throwing darts at a board with letters and whichever symbol the darts spell out, they mobilize billions of dollars to short it, broadcast fud and hit pieces in the media, tank the price, collect profits, then buy it cheap, let it rise back, sell off, short, tank and then maybe short it out of business for max profits. Then repeat after the next coke party. They aren‚Äôt adding value to the market by finding issues in the valuation or performance of a company and profiting from their keen observations and research. They‚Äôre pirate ships with 10,000 cannons ready to sink whatever happens to get within range

2021-04-21 04:52:52,wallstreetbets,"Probably gonna get a lot of hate for this, but honestly, the headlines *directly* from the CNBC news app always seem to give me great breaking news. I heavily emphasize the word ‚Äúdirectly‚Äù because there‚Äôs times I‚Äôll get a headline from Apple‚Äôs news app tagged with CNBC, but the synopsis is so poorly written by whoever writes them for Apple‚Äôs app that a seemingly decent topic is flat out ruined by shitty ass writing. 

Then, I take the headline from the CNBC push noti, and I‚Äôll Google that to read the other 10 articles talking about [insert specific news headline here]. I do this because by using multiple sources that are all reporting and talking about the same headline/topic I end up getting a tremendously better painted picture of it than relying on a single source alone. 

If it‚Äôs not a topic that super interests me or doesn‚Äôt seem terribly important overall, I won‚Äôt read as many, but I‚Äôll at least try to check out the leads for a couple other sources to get the whole picture. 

You‚Äôd be surprised at how many places consistently, frequently and clearly half-ass certain breaking stories/headlines/topics. Either the topic flat out doesn‚Äôt interest the writer, and/or that particular story isn‚Äôt something that reads well to their target audience, but it‚Äôs still good stuff to know. 

Personally, I just find that CNBC (or whoever writes the headlines for their app) has really clear, cogent, direct and solid headlines that don‚Äôt leave me empty handed. I get at least enough info out of their 15-25 word notification that I usually can have a pretty decent idea about what it‚Äôs about and how/why it‚Äôs important or relevant or not. 

But, on the other hand, *reading* full articles directly from CNBC is usually about 70% miss, 25% hit and 5% the author saw something shiny halfway through writing it and forgot what their point was about. More often times than not, reading their articles is like someone was tasked with writing an article about a specific topic, to a specific audience, but could only use words with an odd syllable count, could only use verbs that hadn‚Äôt been used yet for the day, and were required, at minimum, to use 8.5 prepositional phrases in each sentence for each sentence they wrote total."

2021-04-21 12:23:21,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I‚Äôm no expert by any means but a warrant is similar to a call option but it is issued by the company and creates new shares when exercised. That makes it dilutive. On the other hand a call option is issued by a MM (or you/me) and the person either holds the shares or will buy them on the market, creating no new shares. 

To me warrants are better than an offering because it shows some bullish sentiment still (as opposed to calling the top of a rally, like offering sometimes do/are), but not the greatest sign for shareholders. In the end companies need to raise capital and will do it however they please so we‚Äôre just along for the ride ü§∑"

2021-04-21 01:36:23,wallstreetbets,Correct but even ITM you will probably wanna sell those this week because you will get IV crushed after earnings even with a move toward 800. I truly believe we will see 765 this week which will make your calls green. Sell most and leave a runner or 2.
2021-04-21 08:49:25,wallstreetbets,"Explain your last piece, you're holding 715c and want IV to rise becaus of earnings?"
2021-04-21 12:47:42,wallstreetbets,"On the run up to earnings, IV can tend to increase and then drop the day after earnings. It‚Äôs not a guarantee but it is more likely to happen than not. 

An increase of IV increases your calls/puts that you buy. But the opposite happens if you are a seller of calls/puts. 

Buyers of calls/puts want IV to increase. 
Sellers of calls/puts want IV to decrease. 

(You can simultaneously buy and sell options on the same stock to become IV neutral, so whether IV increases or drops it won‚Äôt affect your options). 

For example. If you buy an At The Money 100 strike price call for a stock currently trading at $100. If the price of the stock trades sideways at stays at $100, but the IV increases then you can still make money (obviously taking into account theta etc)."
2021-04-21 12:50:01,wallstreetbets,"I see, thank you for explaining that, I'll have to look into that more"
2021-04-21 12:59:03,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. It‚Äôs very important. 

I take into account IV before anything else. 

I don‚Äôt buy but sell options if IV is close to 90%+ (I may simultaneously buy and sell options to be IV neutral)

For example Netflix after earnings, the IV dropped dramatically. So I bought short and longer dated call options as IV is likely to increase as well as the price, doubling the chance of making money on the options"

Their government responds and changes accordingly they don't stay stuck in bickering between two sides of same coin, this is why their government can evolve with their society while our stuck in political limbo. You are stupid to believe only democracy is the best when this is perfect example of why our democracy has failed, why we have unaffordable healthcare, failing social services for citizens. It's ppl like you who thinks you are the best that there is no room to improve, whereas I studied Chinese for 4 years and I can actually read them to understand their government evolves and prosecute those that's corrupted whereas ours just move on to higher position. FYI lobbying for private interest is a form of corruption but in the US it's totally legal. Just what the fuck is wrong with you to think other have authoritarian government when in reality you are living in one. Must I remind you that Snowden didn't escape US because of its democracy, he have to leave because of US regime will 100% prosecute him for his whistleblowing. You are the evil, you should check your mirror more frequently."

2021-04-21 11:33:02,wallstreetbets,"A would-be blockbuster doing in four weeks what it should have done in one weekend is not a great sign for an already-struggling business. 

HBO Max will be doing streaming-first all year with their movies and again, Amazon is doing the same and Disney is doing it with their big summer film. 

So, an extremely weak BO return on something that would normally float the company is a really bad sign."
2021-04-21 14:37:05,wallstreetbets,"And let me be clear:

That 80/310 figure isn‚Äôt particularly relevant to a discussion about AMC. They‚Äôre a U.S. company, so:

- The 80m figure is the only one that applies

- That 80m is spread out across every movie theater chain in the U.S. 

- That 80m is the TOTAL for four weeks. 

AMC‚Äôs future is fucking grim, and I hate saying that."

2021-04-21 08:04:30,wallstreetbets,"I'm probably especially naive here. My insurance plan is ""don't get sick"". In my understanding, when you have an illness that is too expensive to treat, you die. I definitely don't know how any system could possibly funnel that much money into so few human lives, assuming those people couldn't pay it out of pocket. I thought insurance companies didn't like to actually pay out money unless they absolutely had to, and that's a very high premium with very high motivation to dodge.

Hell, most people on Earth aren't nominally worth 250k per year. So there has to be something else going on, for sure. It's not like every person with a debilitating illness just happens to be a multimillionaire."

If you honestly think this sub is about not hurting your feelings and just making you feel good about yourself regardless of whether you say stupid shit or not, then you should probably go ahead and leave now.

The sub is about risky plays, not purposely trying to lose money by acting like an edgy teenager who wants to avoid looking like a conformist. You're trying too hard to fit in and you're going overboard with it and making yourself look like a fool.

The most respected members here are the smart ones who make good plays, not ones who demand that nobody criticize them and then fall back on ""you're lame! I don't follow your rules dood!""

Lurk more.

* pissed at the insurance and medical fields for not providing adequate care
* pissed off that undereducated truck drivers don't understand how to maintain their health or deal with a disease that's incredibly complex (which isn't fair)
* pissed at regulators for not recognizing how debilitating a disease like diabetes really is.. such that folks who have the disease are forced to work in environments where everyone expects them to perform the same as everyone else.. despite them having a disability.

2021-04-20 23:38:48,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt believe you. I don‚Äôt believe this story. Thanks for the try tho.
2021-04-20 20:34:36,wallstreetbets,"What news?  You means Tesla‚Äôs PR statement?  

The same PR statement about ‚Äúlogs show...‚Äù that they put out following every negative story about a Tesla crash, fire, failure, etc.?  The same logs that they won‚Äôt later release to the NHTSA in the prior 28 investigations, or any other party for independent confirmation?  The same logs that would defeat any lawsuit, but that they‚Äôll settle so they don‚Äôt have to produce in court?  Been there, don‚Äôt that. 

Also you‚Äôll note that in that PR statement, AKA your ‚Äúnews‚Äù, Tesla says that ‚Äúdrivers are advised to keep their hands on the wheel at all times,‚Äù acknowledging that the vehicle can still operate without that happening as shown on so many youtube (and pornhub) videos, because it‚Äôs only advised and not required?

And also you‚Äôll note that ‚ÄúTesla did not respond to questions‚Äù following that release of that PR statement. 

Don‚Äôt worry, eventually you‚Äôll see the same pattern yourself and will stop believing their PR statements are news or that they clear the company of fault."
2021-04-21 06:19:01,wallstreetbets,"They don‚Äôt have to release information that isn‚Äôt legally required, why would you if you know what occurred in the incident?  If it was pertinent to an investigation they would get a subpoena. 

 There have been Zero incidents of AP causing an accident in a situation where a driver wasn‚Äôt being extremely negligent.   But sure, I believe some random hater on the internet over actual investigative agencies. 

Please show me where Tesla has settled out of court.  Oh wait, more rampant speculation because you don‚Äôt know actual facts about any of the cases.  Maybe one day you‚Äôll realize news isn‚Äôt the fucking news, it‚Äôs all propagandist bullshit with an agenda.  Just like this entire ‚Äústory‚Äù was.

Btw, the news I‚Äôm referring to is from the *sheriffs office*, not from Tesla.  But hey I guess the SO is also a part of Tesla‚Äôs PR?

Have fun driving your Kia Sophia, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs such a better ride than a Tesla."

I can also confirm so have 70 other businesses.  I meet with their IT at a yearly conference.  Virtual this year!

PaySafe support is 100% overseas.  I‚Äôm not that guy, but seriously I couldn‚Äôt understand them.  They also are notorious for pushing blame and forcing techs to make very long drives/flights to unattended locations before they‚Äôll continue to work an issue. To make you prove it‚Äôs not them.

This company is not around to support you, they are around to collect your payment and skirt around as long as they can until you finally had enough and move on.

Legit shit!  The company I work for strongly believes in working relationships.  To the point if you work to resolve and not finger point you‚Äôll always keep our business.  Working with PaySafe techs seriously gave you the cheap car salesman vibe.  They‚Äôre pure shit!

Just the financial facts should be presented. Speculation shouldn‚Äôt be made by TV personalities. The person delivering the speculation is bound to affect decisions."
2021-04-21 12:34:54,wallstreetbets,"All news reports are biased. What stock to discuss is a subjective decision. What you say about it is based on your biases. And, I don't care about a stocks past performance. I want many people's opinion about what it will do in the future.

I've evolved past deifying my news sources. I go to many sources I trust or understand to form my own opinion. I like Cramer, he educates me. But worship him?  Make a play on his word alone? never.

Should he just display a hit map of the entire market? Maybe he wouldn't even need audio.

Let's play a game. You will have an hour on CNBC tonight at 6:00 PM.

Give me an outline of what you would do... not what others shouldn't do.

My show would have regular segments about fundamental analysis, balance sheet reading and charting but I would continue the CEO interviews even though they are bit of fluff and cheering. Those people work for me and I want to know what they are doing.

The lightning round is impressive. He can think on his feet but sometimes his off the cuff remarks need more explanation. I don't always agree but I come away a little smarter."
2021-04-21 15:15:17,wallstreetbets,"I like the fundamental analysis. Even though it feels as if there‚Äôs a huge fundamentals shift going on right now. Any major news from last shows calls. Any news (as unbiased as possible) that could affect trends (i.e.- Tesla crash earlier this week) 

I don‚Äôt glean much from the CEO interviews, anyone with the incentive to be only positive makes me overcompensate risk wise, so I could take it or leave it. 

Viewer calls are always cool to me. Real life scenarios where he has to think on his feet are where I get the most from him. Just the logic flow is interesting. 

Viewer polls for different price tiers to include more audience. (I.e- viewers have an online poll or something where they can indicate bullish or bearish on tiers like <$10 tickers <$30, <$50 etc. then his analysis on why people might have chosen those would be interesting. Market psychology is something I‚Äôm very interested in and if they could put together a segment covering the polls and maybe try to infer why viewers feel the way they do. 

Just to be clear I watch his show in the background but usually I just look up the calls he‚Äôs made after the episode. It‚Äôs the largest finance program on the air and it would be foolish to not be tapped into what such a large population is. All that being said, I think he‚Äôs an ass, who has a non-zero chance of having an agenda of some sort, obviously that‚Äôs speculation but he‚Äôs in a very good position to not only steer the market unwillingly, but also willingly"
2021-04-21 09:45:14,wallstreetbets,"I like Cramer, he is educational. But now I will always see Mr. Lahey.

Ref timing markets, it‚Äôs a ridiculous idea imo. I hedge and outlive the downturn without forced liquidations - those people they jump in and out are either full of sh1t or plain lucky. Most of the time they miss the return and retrofit the story to make themselves look good in it."

2021-04-21 11:01:34,wallstreetbets,"Moon or not, once GME is priced the same as other e-commerce companies, then the company will easily be 3-4 times the current price. Compare the P/S ratios of companies like Chewy, Wayfair, JD, etc, with GME. Those companies have ratios that are multiples greater than GME, and GME will grow revenue faster than any of them for the next few years as the transformation continues. So you are holding gold right now, squeeze or no squeeze. On top of that, GME has crazy short interest, weather you believe what is reported or believe it is way higher. Patience is going to be the biggest contributor to your success with this investment."
2021-04-21 11:12:46,wallstreetbets,"It is also easier to hold if you are not buying options. I get too excited sometimes as well and buy too many options, and a lot of times that money just gets donated to HFs. If you buy shares, then dips aren't so bad."

The only thing that has changed since then is the company has made the transformation that everyone have been wanting. This company is in a much better position now then it was then. You should know why you are investing in a company and why you are selling. IMO it doesn't make any sense to sell right now. And you can tell by the volume, most GME holders agree."

2021-04-21 00:14:34,wallstreetbets,"Easier said than done in hindsight. When you're in the hot seat and every 5 seconds you see your account going up by the thousands you can't stop and don't want to stop until it shoots back down nose diving 50%. And when you're at 50% your brain tells you, HOLD THAT SHIT and sell it when it reaches the peak it was at 2 seconds ago. Then it just never go back up there and you hold and hope that it goes back up there or even CLOSE to up there. It goes up but not at the price you want it to, you hold a little longer and you hold JUSTTT a little longer maybe it will, and it doesn't and it bottoms.

Source: I was up $60,000 with a $8,000 investment and I didn't sell because I held and hoped that it will go up to $800 when it was at $400, it shot down to $200, and I hoped it will go back up to $400 so I can sell, then it goes to $320 on Friday. Just not there yet, I hold. $200, I hold, maybe tomorrow when I wake up it will be $400. I wake up, $100. I sold at cost and break even."

2021-04-21 18:49:37,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt wait. I did bench yesterday btw. Did 125 x 15 135 x 9 and 145 x 4. Isn‚Äôt much but I hadn‚Äôt been in a week and my ribs were a bit sore lifting it off the bar and putting it back
2021-04-21 18:43:08,wallstreetbets,not those
2021-04-21 18:25:31,wallstreetbets,I was asleep
2021-04-21 18:33:11,wallstreetbets,Talk about your hobbies and what you like to do for fun
2021-04-21 17:32:41,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre just jealous that you‚Äôre short af at a whopping 8-20 inches tall üò≠
2021-04-21 16:27:21,wallstreetbets,Lol. I‚Äôm hitting the gym now that ribs are better
2021-04-21 17:37:09,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs the kia dude?  ü§°.

2021-04-21 18:36:34,wallstreetbets,"The last year I‚Äôve done barely anything other than Reddit and work though...

Apes thinks alike üò≠"

2021-04-20 20:40:56,wallstreetbets,"I think you missed the point. Galvin doesn't want you to control it on any platform and is looking to establish precedent to fuck retail. Robinhood was shitty yes, but that is no reason to destroy retail for lower income."
2021-04-21 12:38:33,wallstreetbets,This dude FUCKS!
2021-04-21 03:21:53,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-21 11:53:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but the two stocks are trending the same way each day because of the pending merger. Neither is wildly out of wack with the other."
2021-04-21 11:00:47,wallstreetbets,Absolutely (if he's planning on holding LONG)
2021-04-21 19:26:55,wallstreetbets, $AMZN was analyzed by 34 analysts. The buy consensus is at 98%. So analysts seem to be very confident about $AMZN.

2021-04-21 18:17:43,wallstreetbets,Still in this?
2021-04-21 14:50:11,wallstreetbets,So is everyone holding or did this ship fall apart
2021-04-21 16:36:02,wallstreetbets,"We're all still holding even though you're not allowed to talk about gme any more. No worries bro, we're all still here."
