2021-05-21 19:55:29,stocks,"I don't see this very often (I have seen it though) with publicly traded companies, but I do see it often with mismanaged businesses.

If there were a debt free business in your local neighborhood that held $100,000 in assets and it was being managed by a fool who was expected to run it into the ground at a steady decline over the following 5 years, it could be argued that a slice of that pie is worth $0 \*today\*.

This company has experienced year-over-year losses (losing money every year these last 5 years). So...the current pricing makes sense in that light.

If you see an opportunity / future catalyst for a turn-around, this would be a good buy. Assets mean nothing though under these conditions (repeated negative returns on said assets)."

2021-05-21 19:13:21,stocks,That‚Äôs too bold of a claim to just lay that accusation down and not back it up by saying you haven‚Äôt looked at it. Can you share some sources or why you think this is the case?
2021-05-21 18:05:11,stocks,I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by cost basis relating to the dividend payout. The dividend payout depends on the amount of shares you own before the ex dividend date. If you bought shares after the ex dividend date then you won‚Äôt get dividends for those shares
2021-05-21 18:12:37,stocks,"Just what I have experienced not sure if this is helpful. 

DRIP short for dividend reinvestment plan. ( just for others).
I have a  TD ameritrade account the way it works is cash comes in but the broker issues the cash equivalent in stock . 

TD ameritrade  claim , by  using DRIP we as investors will  get  better price than open market as they will fill this through their pool of stocks.

I have noticed similar instances  in my  pastPfizer  and Gilead dividends the costs are a  little  higher/ lower than the market price close."

2021-05-21 17:00:36,stocks,"Ask him what his compounded annual growth rate is in his portfolio (very difficult to do for accounts that have money continually added to them). If it‚Äôs more than 10%, you should follow his advice, and ask him how to pick stocks. If it‚Äôs less than 8%, bet him that you can outperform him over the next five years investing in just VOO."
2021-05-21 17:43:40,stocks,">he points to expense ratios and how they ""aren't actually tracking their holdings"".

he seems to be out of date - expense ratios used to be in the 1-2% range and could really eat into your earnings.  but now?  VTI has an expense ratio of 0.03%.  FSKAX (fidelity's total market index fund) has an expense ratio of 0.015%."
2021-05-21 17:13:58,stocks,"Trying to convince him is the wrong strategy. You're going to have vast differences of philosophy with your parents over time. If you're going to involve money in the relationship it's going to get even more diverse.  Have an in depth conversation with him, ask him why he doesnt believe in them, cause while they do historically do better than the market they're not better investments if you can pick specific companies that do better. An ETF is a collection of good and bad companies, the bad ones bring the ETF down and limit its growth potential. You're way better off picking the lead dog companies. If you can. That's all hes saying really."

2021-05-21 18:23:31,stocks,"I obviously don't know either of you, but I'd take a guess that it's an ego thing.  Yes, your dad is probably good at trading, however trading is not for everyone or even most people.  It also requires careful and constant attention to the market.  Your ETF idea is, in my opinion, absolutely fantastic for where you're at in life.  It provides great returns, and it requires very minimal mental energy.  It's likely it's your dad's ego expressing in a way that is saying, ""I'm the best at this, and if you don't acknowledge this in the ways I want, well you're wrong.""  I'd take the strategy of acknowledging that you respect your dad and his knowledge, however I'd also communicate that you are at a point in life where you need to focus your mental resources towards college and not be preoccupied with day trading.  I think that would be a good case, and hopefully he respects your needs and wants.  Also, you can keep the door open by saying that you'd like to learn from him how to day trade at some later point in time like after college or during summers."

If you start making annual contributions to it starting this year and keep on doing this every single year for the next couple of decades, then even with very boring and conservative stock picks you will have a very nice retirement nest egg saved up. Good luck to you kid."
2021-05-21 19:22:26,stocks,">however, he presents a front of disdain to the idea of investing in ETFs. he points to expense ratios and how they ""aren't actually tracking their holdings"".

he's correct. ETFs are not perfect. there are possible problems, including fees and tracking error. listen to dad on this. with ETFs you always pay the annual management fee + the difference in the bid/ask spread every time you buy. with high-volume ETFs the spread is a penny or less, but low-volume ETFs can have a substantial spread that amounts to a front-load fee and a redemption fee. with lots of transactions, this can add up. 

tracking error can also be a problem. https://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/09/tracking-error-etf-funds.asp

in some cases, mutual funds can be superior to ETFs. the only major advantage for ETFs is in a taxable brokerage account, as ETFs are structured to minimize capital gains. otherwise, they're not magic or anything."
2021-05-21 19:17:06,stocks,Explain to him market efficiency and how people who buy index funds are making traders and investors work for them for free.
2021-05-21 17:57:44,stocks,Give him a copy of John Bogle‚Äôs classic. The little book of common sense investing.
2021-05-21 17:15:01,stocks,"It‚Äôs tough without really knowing what your father has in mind. He may be fully aware of what he‚Äôs doing but he could just be ‚Äúdumbing down‚Äù an excuse for you to take on more risk. It does seem like he is doing well based on capital you expect him to commit to it. He may already have a separate account for you diversified across ETFs in a trust. All speculative haha 

Absent any other data, I would personally recommend investing for the long run through ETFs like you suggested. With that in mind, if that‚Äôs the main objective, I may suggest looking into Betterment or Wealthfront with your father. These are robo advisors. I use betterment and you basically establish your risk profile and based on that, it will allocate your capital across equity and fixed income ETFs. They also have tax loss harvesting feature so it plays pretty nicely for a hands off long term strategy."
2021-05-21 18:03:39,stocks,I think you understand investing better than your father does.
2021-05-21 17:08:21,stocks,Right now is not a good time to invest in market . I recommend waiting for a couple of months. Accumulate your cash .

2021-05-21 19:52:12,stocks,"this is a great point, and thanks a lot. It might be a bit of an ego thing, but he is an amazing father. , and  I think his perspective is warped by his perception of the market high that is going on now from  and timing  good entry point.  this is a great point though"

2021-05-21 16:05:41,stocks,"I agree unfortunately...     

A *hypothetical* hydrogen system could be almost a drop in replacement for gas, essentially converting electricity to a stable fuel that can easily be transported/stored. But that *hypothetical* system hasn't emerged and the current solutions (pressurized, low efficiency, etc) are problematic.   

Battery technology has problems too, but at least it is ready for prime-time *today*. And if battery technology improves then we can re-use any charging infrastructure we have and often 1:1 upgrade the batteries in existing designs with the new technology.   

If there is some substantial break through in hydrogen that solves a lot of the very real logistical challenges then it could still become a major competitor but until that happens it seems foolish to go in with both feet Vs. a known quantity like battery-electric."
2021-05-21 18:03:43,stocks,"Hydrogen is a must for air travel of the future. In that use case pure electric does not work. You need thrust in order to travel at high altitudes, and aside from jet fuel what other alternatives are there?

They‚Äôre so entrenched in dogma and hierarchy and to never question the status quo. They still continue to dump money into hydrogen instead of battery technology."
2021-05-21 19:33:29,stocks,He's prolly right... if there was any way to put a battery in every car.
2021-05-21 17:51:55,stocks,Says a guy who has a significant investment in a battery company.
2021-05-21 17:40:24,stocks,"I think it's well known that the use case scenario of hydrogen is for larger transport, not cars.

All the stocks doing OK reflect this as well."
2021-05-21 16:28:56,stocks,"New hydrogen fuel tech spending is mostly going to docks, airports, and warehouses in 2021.  Long haul/fleet hydrogen is going to be niche for the foreseeable future unless some breakthrough tech comes along.  Big hydrogen fuel setups are still way more expensive than battery.  

It is the smaller and slower fuel cell vehicles like forklifts and air ground transport that make sense.  The larger hydrogen fuel cell setups become problematic as being around a lot of pressurized hydrogen is potentially a very unsafe place to be.  Batteries are much easier to make safe for highway speed crashes."
2021-05-21 16:20:04,stocks,"This is about 5 years out of date. Hydrogen is basically a known quantity now and any sensible person would start considering it as a vehicle fuel (see Daimler's announcement about hydrogen trucks). Likewise, Diess is basically stuck in the past and citing evidence that is no longer true."
2021-05-21 18:12:42,stocks,Pretty much the green deal worldwide is looking to Hydrogen for shipping too.
2021-05-21 18:02:16,stocks,Exactly.  I got downvoted to hell for saying something negative about a li-ion battery.  It's practically a conspiracy to consider H2 as a viable fuel.
2021-05-21 17:59:40,stocks,"That's the narrative they are selling everyone.  There are many cars that can run H2.  Toyota is racing a Corolla later this month.  BMW made a bivalent engine in 2005.  The first hydrogen powered car was made in the 1800s.

2021-05-21 16:34:31,stocks,"Their new IRaS technology is useful to avoid boil-off, but it only solves the truck side of the equation. Hydrogen still remains very inefficient to produce and transport, and ""GenH2"" only solves maybe 1/3 of the issues it had five years ago."

2021-05-21 17:24:48,stocks,"I've heard about hydrogen for years and little has come. The whole EV boom happened while hydrogen failed to materialise, its like betamax vs VHS all over again.



I do agree that hydrogen or biogas can have a purpose for heavy machinery. With current battery tech it's also difficult to imagine electric airplanes the size of a 747 or trucks to be replaced. I can surely see hydrogen trucks, that is, if not battery tech outrun it. We have the infrastructure to charge EVs (slowly but surely) in every home already"
2021-05-21 17:27:42,stocks,EVs died around 1910-1920 and needed to wait until 2010 before coming back. I think people are old enough to remember the struggle to develop hydrogen cars but are too young to remember the era of EV disappointment.
2021-05-21 18:01:15,stocks,first hydrogen car was made in the 1800s :)
2021-05-21 18:09:41,stocks,First fuel cell car was in the 1960s. The cars from the 1800s were some kind of hydrogen combustion vehicle.

2021-05-21 18:14:04,stocks,"Since global warming wasn't a concern back then, I doubt there was a serious attempt to make hydrogen combustion cars work back in the day. Gasoline/diesel/alcohol were much better fuels for that period."

 Presently, they have engineered combustion engines that have negligible NOx emissions.  Its a shame not many people show interest in pursuing it.  Toyota is about to race a H2 fueled Corolla (non fuel cell) and Hyundai I think is still working on it."
2021-05-21 18:47:08,stocks,"Hydrogen combustion is being pursued now, largely due to the need to find an alternative to gasoline/diesel."

One strategy I use to avoid emotionally selling at a loss is to stubbornly refuse to sell until a stock gains again. I‚Äôm not recommending it for you, because I don‚Äôt know your personality, but it works for me. I‚Äôve only been investing for less than two months, and I‚Äôve already had at least three stocks climb back from losses before I dumped them for minor profits. (Of course, this hasn‚Äôt worked for every stock; some are still deep in the red, and I still curse them out every day, asking them why they won‚Äôt swing upward.)

Another strategy? Understand that investing is a long-term game. Once you‚Äôve developed that long-term outlook (and this can take a while), you‚Äôll start to see losses as temporary hiccups rather than doomsday.

2021-05-21 15:31:32,stocks,Had this one time when I invested in Fiat Chrysler before it became Stellantis. I received these random Louis Vuitton shares in my account and I had a gain of like over 50k randomly. I freaked out thinking I really hit the jackpot. Then maybe an hour later they were gone and customer service said it was a mistake and I wasn't the only one. Feelsbadman. - Basically Investing Podcast
2021-05-21 15:13:01,stocks,So it is a glitch or something? Kinda of worrisome this can happen
2021-05-21 15:37:31,stocks,Wierd lol. But this isn't even a real ticker just a bunch of numbers and letters
2021-05-21 15:38:09,stocks,I doubt it was a glitch.. it was likely an event with one of your holdings.
2021-05-21 15:40:38,stocks,Maybe aliens are just trying to communicate to you. Not sure if your hearing about those recent UFO spotting's. Just a thought not financial advice (haha)
2021-05-21 15:40:57,stocks,Well it would be nice if they would tell you. Would customer service know who it would be from?
2021-05-21 15:56:04,stocks,Okay so yes it was one of my positions they are starting some sort of new company and are offering those shares to existing shareholders at a 25% discount or something
2021-05-21 15:18:00,stocks,"I haven't been to a JoAnn's in my adult life that felt like a successfull business.

It may just be the SoCal regional management, but I don't feel like I can trust this business with my money."

2021-05-21 15:10:37,stocks,"I got in around 11 dollars just because the name brand alone would attract buyers just like it did for PLBY.  Which I‚Äôm kicking myself still for not getting in then. 

Combine the well known brand and good numbers I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a pretty good/safe long term buy any price under 15."
2021-05-21 15:09:13,stocks,Bought a bunch at the IPO went under on it for a few weeks after that and bought some more
2021-05-21 17:21:27,stocks,It just issued at 12 bucks.  Then attracted a TON of retail attention because of a low PE ratio. Any company with a 2 PE ratio isnt going to dazzle come earnings report time.  And retail is easily distracted. If you're interested in the stock I'd just wait and if will come back down. Might take 3 to 6 months but retail will get bored and vacate the premises.
2021-05-21 17:11:58,stocks,I would say that‚Äôs fairly accurate of TN stores as well until XMAS and then it is nuts.
2021-05-21 18:16:29,stocks,How the hell can they pay for rent in these big box stores near places like best buy and target?
2021-05-21 18:26:55,stocks,Have you seen orders pick up at all over the last 12 months? Do you get a lot of customer returns?
2021-05-21 18:39:45,stocks,"Online orders were through the roof during the summer last year. 

I'm not sure about returns but it's slow season right now so not much to see. 

The last 4 months in the year things get super busy. We process thousands of $300+ sewing machines and such per month.

If the supply chain is working as it should next busy season should be good. 

2 years ago they implemented a new sap system and things went to shit for months but now the system is very smooth. I thank covid for all the improvements."
2021-05-21 14:25:05,stocks,i didnt even know this existed lmao
2021-05-21 16:31:47,stocks,"Makes sense, was always a bit weird having to have a 2nd amazon app just to get things a bit quicker. Should get more people using it if it's now in the normal Amazon app."
2021-05-21 18:59:44,stocks,Why is it good news for the reasons you listed? They are moving the service to the regular app and website so more people use it.
2021-05-21 17:19:28,stocks,"I used it during the covid panic, no one else seemed to know about it"
2021-05-21 19:02:32,stocks,"Weird enough, this news makes me feel better about the GDRX situation"

I think I liked it more because you were the Villian to the Prime worker and Bar tender . But when I ordered several boxes of Peanut M&M's and distributed freely to the bar I was a hero."
2021-05-21 18:28:29,stocks,"Amazon food delivery was nuts too. 0 fees and it wasn‚Äôt jacked up pricing like DoorDash was. They also made it inconvenient to tip so it was literally the same price as going yourself.

Yeah not surprised it got shut down lol"
2021-05-21 18:27:46,stocks,Me either lol
2021-05-21 18:01:08,stocks,"Been a prime member for a decade, and I‚Äôve never heard of this.  Maybe they didn‚Äôt advertise it on purpose since it operates at a loss?"
2021-05-21 16:53:14,stocks,Gopuff seems like they're trying to take over that space.
2021-05-21 16:51:22,stocks,I wish I had friends like you
2021-05-21 16:52:37,stocks,I used to order frequently from the app and I too was always drunk. I‚Äôm willing to bet most of us were drunk when using the app. How could Amazon not find a way to capitalize off the drunk user market? It seems kinda easy to manipulate. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre ordering snacks that indicate you‚Äôre drunk. Would you also like to add 6 units of silly putty and a pound of teriyaki beef jerky to your order?‚Äù ‚Äúfuck yeah I‚Äôd like to add that to my order!‚Äù
2021-05-21 18:22:49,stocks,Amazon should go full on Casino and give out free Whiskey with every purchase of $30.

2021-05-21 14:32:24,stocks,"$5.3 bn market cap, not $65m

2021-05-21 17:00:29,stocks,So buy negg?
2021-05-21 14:33:13,stocks,That makes a ton of sense. I don't know why multiple outlets reported a market cap so small
2021-05-21 14:44:37,stocks,Inevitably the burden of those taxes and regulations will get passed along to the consumer and the business will adapt.  (this is not an opinion on $DPZ but rather a general comment)
2021-05-21 17:27:47,stocks,"Regulations are coming. When you order a pizza you dont realize how much sugar is in it.  I've worked for every major pizza chain, you put a 5 lb bag of sugar in the sauce, another in the dough, and theres even some in the pepperoni of certain chains. If they could put in the cheese they would. 

The whole reason you crave any chains food is because it's not real food. Its processed fat and added sugar. 

Theres a movement going on right now where people are quitting added sugar. I tried it and I can tell you from experience I will never go back to added sugar. The govt is increasing regulations because they have to pay for our healthcare now and they dont want us all having the diabeetus.  It's too expensive for them to allow us to eat junk food anymore. 

More regulations on sugar companies, coupled with a culture change that will eventually see the end of added sugar, as hard as that is to imagine. But that's the future imo. Added sugar is oil, it's not going anywhere overnight but it has no future 50 years from now"
2021-05-21 16:48:23,stocks,I believe they got rid of the 7.99 carry out large pizza special. They lost my business after that. The pizza delivery space is crowded but dominos is probably the top player there.
2021-05-21 16:11:39,stocks,Held this one since 2009. It's a keeper!
2021-05-21 19:13:01,stocks,Dominos pizza tastes like the smell of wet dog
2021-05-21 17:30:08,stocks,"Very useful info, thanks very much :)"
2021-05-21 14:16:04,stocks,"Well if you bought TSLA in January as many new investors did you‚Äôd be down 30% today

I think people are surprised that speculative growth stocks don‚Äôt simply print money week after week, and for whatever reason a lot of people seemed to dump everything in that basket"
2021-05-21 17:47:37,stocks,I don‚Äôt complain. But it can be quite frustrating when great companies are announcing great earnings and positive news and the stock is bleeding the day after
2021-05-21 18:59:50,stocks,"I think a lot of traders started in 2020.  If you picked the right time in 2020, you could throw a dart at a dart board to pick a stock, and make money.

I believe a lot of these people think that was normal market behavior... they are not used to crashes and resets."
2021-05-21 14:11:06,stocks,"I think people have run out of capital to buy dips, I know I have. Now I'm stuck in a few positions I wish I could buy at these lower prices but I have no more monies"

2021-05-21 14:40:26,stocks,"The psychology of losses is such that it far exceeds the joy of equivalent gains.  People get stuck in their down positions, when sometimes it is a lot better just to sell and put the capital to work somewhere it will do better.  taking losses and moving on is an important market lesson... also losses can be used to offset gains for tax purposes.  so don't complain; move on."
2021-05-21 14:08:59,stocks,"The market, over the past year, has been flooded with amateurs. Give it time."
2021-05-21 14:10:03,stocks,Red days for the meme stocks is what people are complaining about. Most of them are down 30+ percent

2021-05-21 19:10:27,stocks,"everything has been red for the last 5 months, that‚Äôs a lot."
2021-05-21 18:36:40,stocks,"People complain about red days because they FOMO on stocks instead of actually doing proper DD and TA. I have no sympathy for people who don‚Äôt even put in one percent of effort to do the work on stocks they‚Äôre buying. They have no respect for money and are simply foolishly gambling money. The more they lose the more they cry. Those are the same idiots that will fool themselves into bag holding shit companies. In other words ‚Äúinvoluntary investors‚Äù.

Meanwhile I‚Äôm shopping for deals when these idiots sell at a loss from good quality companies. Thanks for the discount losers!

The market is a really efficient machine that transfers money from the impatient to the patient!

How is it that people are still losing money in a bull market!? Absolutely hilarious! Hint: because they gambled their money instead of actually putting the work in investing..."
2021-05-21 14:33:09,stocks,"But this time is different. I know what the future holds for America, unlike these silly boomers who are stuck in their old ways. Growth = stock price goes up."

2021-05-21 17:33:14,stocks,"And I'm the complete opposite, my worst drawdown was 3% which put me back at the same level as I was at 28/3-2021. I've promised myself not to buy until I see at bigger dip, 3% isn't worth the hassle. Even 5% is still only a correction..."
2021-05-21 18:39:31,stocks,Haha you‚Äôre now an involuntary investor! Serves you right for FOMOing.
2021-05-21 15:23:46,stocks,As they should with the rest of the economy opening up
2021-05-21 15:33:24,stocks,"There's also the chance that people forget their investment convictions completely, and sell just because something is red. No real reason as to why other than fear. Then these people could easily miss out on a rebound/recovery, and they just sell at a loss due to fear, impatience and emotion when holding could just be the best strategy. 

When a lot of things are down right now and not that many things are taking off, it's kind of hard to sell your losses and put them somewhere else that'd doing better when nothing else is really doing THAT much better. Unless you short in bear markets."
2021-05-21 17:23:46,stocks,"Thats what i did with ARKK. Why ride that shit down further? I jumped off at 120 with a 500$ loss. Beats riding it down to under 100.  
Its so heavy TSLA i dont think it will see 150/share again for a long time. All Elon had to do was release a normal fucking looking pickup truck. But no the arrogant prick released a mars rover looking thing. So what does ford do? Steals your fucking lunch by making an EV pickup that doesnt look like garbage."
2021-05-21 16:56:28,stocks,After the GME squeeze I've told my self to start taking profits at 5% or if I'm feeling lucky 10% than no more. Then move on to something else

Were you buying and holding or trimming the top and cutting losers?"
2021-05-21 19:21:27,stocks,No it hasn‚Äôt. A little over half of my investments have been up. The NASDAQ and SPY also hit new all time highs in the spring. They haven‚Äôt exactly crashed.
2021-05-21 17:50:26,stocks,"Ya, I'm making some rules for my self from now on. No more buying dips unless it's 10-15% everything else is a waste of time, the real skill is when deciding to cash out"
2021-05-21 19:08:26,stocks,FOMOing into bank stocks? Ya I'm real sucker
2021-05-21 16:12:09,stocks,"fear is bad too, I agree.
there are quite a few things that have been going up as part of this sectoral rotation:  financials, industrials, transport, materials, energy, commodities.  I think of this as a study in why diversification matters."

2021-05-21 12:58:12,stocks,"I would literally be slightly over a million dollars richer right now if I never panicked at a falling market and just held all of my positions.

Buy solid mid-large cap companies and ETFs and just forget your sell button exists."
2021-05-21 13:18:57,stocks,"Do not sell when it drops, unless you are picking very questionable companies to begin with, you should add to your positions that are down so your cost average will go down as well, when the price rebounds you've profited even more. If you don't have money to add to your position, just hold until it recovers. 

You should not invest with money that you know you will need in the short-term(3-6 months for me at least), the money you are investing should be extra money that you don't even need if there's an emergency. Stock market goes up OVER TIME. The people that play short term are generally either very experienced or gambling. 

Gambling is perfectly OK and fun but that is a 4rd savings that is beyond your budget, emergency fund and investment fund. Did you skip vacation or stop spending entertainment money for a month or 2? Take a shot with that cash. Then if you win, most goes into the investment account and you can gamble with the same amount that started with. If you win take a break from gambling for a month or 2 and park the money in a safe etf bc it's not easy and you could develop bad habits if you get lucky right away and keep trying. Use that time to do research for your next gamble.

Being successful in the market is not 100% what you pick but more how you manage your money and patience."

2021-05-21 12:27:02,stocks,"I wouldn't - Even, beyond the 2010 flash crash, I've seen individual stock prices juke down 5-10% before quickly returning multiple times, especially on earnings. We just saw that a couple days ago in no-no money as well. I've heard trailing stops make sense if you're not going to pay close attention, but in that case I'd say you're better off in index funds anyway."

2021-05-21 18:38:45,stocks,I love seeing this. Reminds me of my Dad. If you believe in the company long term why are you putting a trailing stop? You‚Äôre concern is losing money/not taking gains. Defeats the purpose of a long term investment

2021-05-21 19:55:48,stocks,Not really a long term hold if you constantly buy and sell it
2021-05-21 13:39:04,stocks,"My experience with trailing stops is:

A) I set the trail too tight and it sells during normal, boring moves upward (which include modest pullbacks as we all know)

B) I set the trail loose enough to let it ride up, and if it crashes I end up with no profits by the time it triggers.

I don't believe the sweet spot exists.

I bought a ticker last week that had gapped down to open on no news, set a trail just in case for $1, stock started ripping, dipped again causing me to sell, then went up $11.

I only had bought 50 shares but that's still about $500 I don't have now. Fucking Trails."

The only perk about investing in gold and silver is actually owning gold/silver bullion as its pretty cool to look at, of course my opinion. The only catalyst I can think of for gold/silver is inflation increasing, but that will also impact the prices of non-growth stocks."

2021-05-21 17:48:36,stocks,"Been investing on and off in precious metal stocks for over a decade.  Quick thoughts:

Large gold producers: NEM, AEM, KL, AU, GOLD.  NEM pays a pretty good dividend, especially for this sector.  I used to hold GOLD, but don't anymore: it seems to chronically underperform the rest of the sector and fall harder when the sector hits a downturn.

Small-mid gold producers: AUY, KGC, SSRM, EGO, HMY.  Pick one based on which seems to be the cheapest of the bunch at a given time.

Larger silver producers: PAAS, AG, HL.  PAAS is the most stable of the bunch, AG has a lot of buzz behind it and will be a great momentum play if silver really takes off (it was one of the stocks Robinhood blocked trading off back during the Gamestop short squeeze). HL moves a lot and can be a good trading stock.

Smaller silver producers: CDE, EXK, MAG, SVM, FSM, SILV.  Most of these stocks have had big run ups recently and are pretty high priced.  FSM is the exception because it just acquired a junior miner and took a big hit for it, could be a good buy at this price.  SVM has a solid balance sheet, but tends to lag because its mines are based in China.  I think it'll catch up once silver starts moving up.

Streaming companies: WPM, RGLD, FNV, SAND, OR.  These companies don't operate mines, but fund mining operations in exchange for a share of the mine's revenue or production.  Less risk and exposure means less movement in the price, which can be a good or bad thing depending on your goals."

So for example here [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KL/financials?p=KL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KL/financials?p=KL) it says its companys profit is greater then its cost of revenue.

2021-05-21 13:31:33,stocks,thats why im getting into the stocks because of the inflation catalyst looking at how most of the stocks called here are about 50% off their 2008 peak and how the current situation is so much worse
2021-05-21 13:10:35,stocks,Hey any recommendations for alternatives if silver isnt on my uk online broker?
2021-05-21 13:59:02,stocks,"Sure thing. I look at a few things for miners. $KL stands out due to it's industry leading gross profit margin (72% vs 42% for $GOLD), EV/EBITDA of 5.95x vs 7.04x, and fortress balance sheet ($7 billion in assets vs just $532 million in current liabilities) vs $GOLD ($8.8 billion vs $2.3 billion in liabilities). Also should look at free cash flow generation and AISC (All-in sustaining costs) for miners.

From the article that put me on to this company -

> Kirkland Lake Gold released its preliminary Q1 results earlier this month and reported gold production of ~302,800 ounces, a massive beat vs. its ~280,000-ounce guidance for the period. On a year-over-year basis, production was down from ~330,900 ounces, but it's important to note that this quarter included ~28,600 ounces of gold production from its Holt Mine, which is now on care & maintenance. If we adjust for Holt, production was up in the period.

>At Kirkland Lake's Detour Lake Mine, production was up more than 6% year-over-year due to higher throughput of ~5.72 million tonnes at a higher grade of 0.87 grams per tonne gold (0.84 grams per tonne gold in Q1 2020). Despite similar grades, recovery rates were up 110 basis points year-over-year to 92.2% and above Q4 levels as well (91.8%). It's important to note that this mine is just in the early innings of ramping up into one of the largest mines globally

>Finally, from a cash flow standpoint, Kirkland Lake is set to generate over ~$1.10 billion in free cash flow this year, translating to a free cash flow yield of nearly ~12%, while paying a dividend of nearly 2.00% at current levels. This is a very attractive valuation for a business with industry-leading 55% all-in sustaining cost margins. Besides, Kirkland Lake has the flexibility to grow its dividend, continue its buyback program, and even consider a small bolt-on M&A acquisition that would grow production and or reserves with zero share dilution. This is an enviable position to be in, given that most producers are forced to grow through share dilution and aren't sitting on ~$800 million in cash with no debt.

None of this is to say that $GOLD is a bad bet though. There are several valuation metrics you can look at that would make $GOLD look better (ie Market Cap/Free Cash flow for $KL 17.23x vs $GOLD 15.86x, etc.) I view $KL as having the highest potential for upward price movement due to their industry leading profit margins because they will be able to capture a greater amount of the inflation of golds value"

2021-05-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Double Tops and Upward Triangles So I've been reading the past few hours and I'm having trouble seeing how double tops and upward triangles are related (if at all). This started out with me seeing that COST had a double top flagged on FINVIZ, so I looked it up because I was curious. Turns out that's an indicator that it may fall significantly (If I recall correctly), but upward triangles are indications of a bullish trend. Just thinking about how they are defined/identified, it seems reasonably likely that double tops would appear in the formation of an upward triangle, yet they indicate almost completely opposite things. My guess is that a double top with decreasing support may more likely point to a bearish trend while a double top with increasing support could be the beginnings of an upward triangle. Anyways, thank you for your help."

Just wondering how much original content will there be... Or is it just ""me too"" (which would disappoint me, but maybe would increase subscription loyalty or ARPU nonetheless)..."
2021-05-21 12:40:52,stocks,"Buy out gaming companies for their content so that Netlix can use in house or contracted producers to convert the material into TV and movies. Cheaper than buying out media companies for their existing portfolio's and you arguably get more bang for the buck considering you can continue to collect revenue from video game creation and sales.

The Witcher was a prime example of this approach being successful. Just on a smaller scale."
2021-05-21 14:29:02,stocks,"If you compare Netflix to Disney, it's easy to see Netflix doesn't take advantage of IP the way Disney does. Disney has games, merch, theme parks oriented around its characters. Netflix has built all these universes, but they only go as far as a few seasons of streaming.

This is probably about making games based on Netflix shows and distributing through existing channels, rather than introducing a whole new gaming product for subscribers. That's the fastest and safest next step. They can also use their app to promote them, e.g. you might get a marketing notification from iOS Netflix app that links you to a game about a show you watched."
2021-05-21 16:31:34,stocks,"Looking at the history of game dev and how intensively competitive that space is, I think it's going to end up very badly for Netflix. They are shooting themselves in the foot.  They should focus on creating better content and capture more in international market."
2021-05-21 17:55:12,stocks,"Being a game studio owner I was just waiting for such an announcement.
Not sure what their angle is gonna be though. Apart from interactive movies and narrative content they will probably try some ""virtual playgrounds"" to bring people into online events like Fortnite does. It's just natural for Netflix to move into the gaming (or interactive entertainment in general) space, there's a lot more room to grow."
2021-05-21 10:59:50,stocks,"Note that they're not the only ones trying to get a foot into the business, and it is a tough battle. Google, Amazon and even Sony are failing at this. Microsoft has the best subscription offer, scalable infrastructure that Sony uses themselves and already has tons of studios and contracts with external partners to produce content. Any option whether you stream their games, buy games, subscribe to games or build your own gaming PC stands to profit them. Too early to call it a moat, but it starts to look like that."
2021-05-21 10:43:27,stocks,Could we see a third golden age of licensed MMOs?
2021-05-21 14:46:47,stocks,"It's an interesting idea. But history has taught us that companies with much more experience in software related industries have failed spectacularly when they tried to expand into gaming. It's a ruthless industry and it is very difficult for newcomers to enter. IP legacy is a huge deal for a new player to overcome, most gamers won't touch a game that is called ""mafia cities"" or ""generic racing game N1"", they will prefer the tested GTA 6 and Forza/grand turismo. Hard for them to enter the developer/publisher market because of that. The last one that did it was Microsoft and they have devoted huge amounts of recourses to do it.

Them trying to enter the platform market will be equally difficult. Epic is trying for a while with moderate success, while also investing so much to it.

Could they go the cloud gaming route? They could but still Microsoft could do it much better than them if they wanted. 

I would be happy to be proven wrong but they will probably just burn capital and abandon the endeavour 3 years later"

2021-05-21 12:20:03,stocks,"Well, it‚Äôs an interesting idea.

Making high quality games is exceptionally difficult and they are unlikely to compete with the established studios, but owning many IPs they could come out with a standard formula to exploit them, likely making story based games in vein of what Telltale used to.

Not overly ambitious either graphically and as gameplay, to be played on the same hardware that runs their app. It could be a complement to their show offer.
Here is the new Witcher season, and you also get an episodic visual novel or adventure side story!"

They're comparably cheap to make and don't take long time. They're easy to tie together with Netflix IPs (Stranger Things etc). Add some mobile phone spin-offs, simple gaccha or ""match three"" games and you'll be printing money comparably risk free.



Or do like Google/Amazon, try to create a AAA/MMORPG game and fail spectacularly."

2021-05-21 11:10:31,stocks,"Video games are a crowded space and hardly what you‚Äôd consider a high growth frontier. Google and Amazon both tried for years to succeed in it and neither have posted much of anything. Technology companies are better at providing enabling technologies than making games themselves; even still existing players like Unity, Unreal, and Steam have massive first move advantage.

If a company‚Äôs plan is to move into games as a solution to slowing core business I‚Äôd consider it a risk for the company. Very few real successes and a long list of failures."

edit:

The big thing about Microsoft, nintendo, sony steam is that they have established bases. video games on their platform will always make more money than on some indie console. This becomes a feedback loop where companies only publish games on those systems. Some companies like Epic try to make their platforms more appealing to devs by giving discounts on publishing deals. However all this does is let devs make games with far less money, and then when the copyright runs out they sell on Steam for a bigger profit and epic makes nothing.

That said, Netflix might just partner with those big companies, not release their own platform and publish on theirs. Even then, wouldn't you just invest in them instead then?"

2021-05-21 00:00:00,stocks,Shares owned by Institutions Can someone explain to me how a stock can be 104% of shares held by institutions? I own a stock and my brokerage app said 101% of shares held by institutions last week- today it now says 104% I tried researching how that could be but Im still not understanding- what i got out of it is that it‚Äôs either shorted or the data isn‚Äôt current? I don‚Äôt get how the percentage would go up if the data wasn‚Äôt current. If it is a heavily shorted stock can someone give me some insight on what the potential outcome of that high of institutional ownership would be? Just curious about what might happen in a situation like that. Thank you!
2021-05-21 11:08:11,stocks,"So basically when you short a stock you borrow the shares from someone else.  That creates artificial shares that can be bought and that can result in more than 100% ownership by institutions.

Example Fund A buys a share

Short Seller S borrows that share and sells it to Fund B.

Both A and B are institutions and if those are the only two shares that exist the company is now 200% held by institutions.

Remember institutions can be anyone from other hedge funds to any of the companies running mutual funds or ETFs etc.  Theoretically there could be a squeeze if all of the institutions recalled their shares and refused to sell but that is not likely since the institutions are many and very diverse.  Also most institutions especially the major fund companies don't mind loaning out their shares because they are making extra money loaning the underlying shares in your ETF or mutual fund."

2021-05-21 12:07:58,stocks,"Institutions don‚Äôt own 104%. That ownership is self reported at different times by different institutions.

Assume you and me are institutions:

If I report I own 100% of the float and I sell it all to you and then you report you own 100%, Bloomberg is gonna report 200% institutional ownership.

2 months later when I report I sold all my shares yahoo finance will then report an accurate 100% ownership, unless you sold shares too, then the % would still show a higher number than reality."

They are the only e-commerce giant in China that actually makes a reliable profit, and even if growth slows down with the Chinese government giving the industry more scrutiny, a decent discounted cash flow calculation still makes Alibaba easily worth at least $300/share (nearly 50% upside from the current price). With a price-to-book of only 4.03, p/e of only 24.98, high returns on capital, and a discounted cash flow analysis that points to a $300+ valuation, BABA stock is a steal right now."

I think the only thing the CCP cares more about than money is their image. Good luck with any investing you do though!"
2021-05-21 14:24:09,stocks,"I am not saying to buy or sell. Actually I sort of agree that they might be undervalued but certainly not by 50%. But here are the arguments:

1. You cannot use US valuation on another country. Thats a fatal mistake. Dont do that. It must be compared to other companies in China.
2. Alibaba has no competitive advantages. They are 3rd party dominant and all of their sellers list elsewhere and since there is no real estate limit to selling online...
3. I dont think margins are sustainable. Historically, their margins are very high for a retailer but recently there are some signs of them shrinking, probably due to heavy competition and the fact that they have no exclusivity (see #2 above).
4. Alibaba has a bad reputation. Too many knock offs, illegal products and bad sellers. Their policies are also not customer friendly and too easy for sellers to game.

Now all that said, their growth speaks for itself and their mountain of cash is enticing. So I do agree that there is value here and certainly potential once the cash is deployed. 

If I were them, I would take that cash and spend it outside of Chinese influence. From what I have seen, it seems to me that they are specifically targeting Ma probably because they see him as one of few people who can threaten the CCP politically. So they are likely suppressing him in a effort to diffuse his power. Im not saying this is wrong or right nor am I playing the socialism vs capitalism card, but I am just pointing out the differences between countries. Which brings us back to point 1 above."

Nationalisation by Chinese government - Again it is unlikely that China‚Äôs government will forcefully takeover and de-rail one of the Crown Jewels of Chinese business 

ADR and lack of genuine ownership - Munger and Pabrai don‚Äôt seem to care, furthermore China is trying to become a more reputable nation. If they dishonour the ADR they will be criticised on a global scale.

Also, from my personal experience I've noticed that a lot of my friends who are newer to investing or don't have high paying jobs tend to avoid the ""expensive"" stocks. It's clearly a psychological thing because they all said they didn't want to buy AAPL at $400 but then bought it at $110 post split... for some reason people seem to prefer to own 50 shares of something at $10 than 1 share at $500 despite them investing the exact same amount... its the whole pound of feathers or pound of bricks trick."

probably after (unless you're buying right now), but at the end of the day it's all guess work.

stocks have a tendency to drop after they split. basically the split announcement leads to a big run up, the split happens and the share price gets adjusted accordingly, then lots of people sell off over  the  next couple of weeks dropping  the value (adjusted for apples to apples comparisons) way below the highs from pre-split runup, and potentially below  where the split was announced.

2021-05-21 11:24:45,stocks,"No real discernible difference. The price will stay the same from a valuation standpoint. Say 4-1 split goes into effect at 100 share price. The price will split in to quarters. So each share will have a cost basis of 25. The dilution here will reflect in new price after split. So you‚Äôre still buying the shares at the same price just now the amount of shares outstanding quadrupled. You shouldn‚Äôt be buying shares to ride a wave and get out in the short term. If you‚Äôre bullish on them, but and hold. But paying splits can be volatile and lead to losses. But because you want to own the company, don‚Äôt buy for the pump and dump."

Its a growth tech AI stock with a lot of good things going for it.

At the end of the day, a stock split doesn't affect the fundamentals of the company. Its more of a 'psychological' boost.

I mean look at Tesla and Apple, both of whom recently had stock splits. Yes there was an initial pop, but eventually market forces will dictate what happens."

2021-05-21 12:31:11,stocks,Usually* a stock will dip in price following the split. Leading up to a split you can expect the price to steadily rise.

But anybody who tells you they know what's going to happen is just guessing."
2021-05-21 16:06:30,stocks,"Theoretically shouldn‚Äôt matter at all. Maybe slightly better to buy now before the people who can only afford one post-split share can buy, but poors don‚Äôt really have much affect on the mkt cap of big companies like these"

You're correct that buying the benefit of buying 50 shares at $10 negates the benefits of a split from the original price of $500 per share. However, I would presume that the split is more beneficial to individuals who would not have dropped $500 on a single share or $10/share for 50 shares, but would pay $100 on 10 shares."

2021-05-21 10:25:55,stocks,"It's not a terrible take, its reasonable IMO. Some people see value in high priced stocks (i.e. Berkshire) because it creates that sense of exclusiveness or superiority. 

Now could you argue that a stock split would create a more realistic buying price for retail traders? You absolutely could make that argument and it would be valid as well."
2021-05-21 15:52:30,stocks,"> The split does not inherently change the value of the stock. if a stock is at $600 and is split four ways then you would have 4 stocks of $150 value.

while that's true in a vacuum, in practice it doesn't necessarily end up working that clean.

if stock is at $600 and a 4:1 split gets announced, it might run up to $800 by the time the split happens off of all the hype.

once the split happens, then it would be $200 a share, but post split stocks have a tendency to drop and that $200/share could quickly decay into $150/share or lower. 

remember all the people who bought tsla for like 2500 at the height of the pre-split runup and then were talking  about how much money the lost in the short term over the next month or two?

buying before a split carries the risk of buying into a runup that will revert."

2021-05-21 11:06:19,stocks,"That seems logical. So maybe the reason many gme holders are bullish on a possible stock split is because it will boost the price (either before the split, like it's currently the case with nvidia) or after the split, since that will make the share price much more accessible. And since the % of shorts remains the same, as you said, a big upwards push of the price would mean trouble for the shorts (maybe)."

It's all a gamble and a bit of game theory (guessing what others will do who are trying to guess what you are doing).  There is also the chance this was rumored and already priced in... or the best time might be to buy in August after the news cools off and the psychological benefit of lower share price has an effect.  Nobody knows for certain.  Even the pros are just guessing at the end of the day.  Good luck!
2021-05-21 12:36:40,stocks,Its no difference for you because you understand spliting not change nothing. But most people just like low price . My friend bought tesla just because he can be proud owner of 1 share instead of fractional share of 0.2 . Lol . üòÇ

Intel chips power consumption is driving the server and mobile market toward AMD and that's where Intel has always been the market leader. Go shill your stock somewhere else."

It's great you think Taiwan is safe and will maintain independence and not become like Hong Kong or Tibet, or possibly make a deal to keep China from pushing into Taiwan.  I hope you are right, but I am not willing to bet on it, and I would absolutely not use any foreign-made hardware for something I want to be secure. In this case there are simply too many signs to ignore, between China pushing into Taiwanese airspace, China claiming the entire South China Sea regions as their own, how China has ignored international agreements for their other ""independent"" regions, the smash and grab attitude China shows time and time again towards collecting data from everywhere they can, and so much more.

I think Intel is positioned to do well going forward and do not think what happens with China will impact them beyond whatever impact the market as a whole feels.  I think there is a non-zero chance for this to happen and it is not a potential issue with Intel. By no means am I betting this will happen nor would I want it to.

I do bet on the American government trusting/using homegrown Intel chips over foreign-made hardware, and with the recent uptick in public awareness of the security concerns cyber attacks are, could see new federal guidelines that include using trusted, secure hardware. Beyond that I think Intel has a lot of potential with Mobileye and building new foundries to sell as a service. They are also super cheap right now and have a nice enough dividend."

2021-05-21 00:00:00,stocks,"DE earnings beats estimates From Zacks:

Deere (DE) came out with quarterly earnings of $5.68 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.44 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.11 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 27.93%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this agricultural equipment manufacturer would post earnings of $2.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.87, delivering a surprise of 80%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

Deere, which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry, posted revenues of $11 billion for the quarter ended April 2021, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.99%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $8.22 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.

Deere shares have added about 32% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 10.7%."

2021-05-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Is it worth it to invest in multiple shares of Coca Cola for Dividends? I am a new investor and while I am learning more every day and looking into stuff more and more, Coca Cola has caught my eye. Basically, coca cola (I'll just say KO for now on) was shown to have a div/yield of around 3. On top of that, KO isn't going anywhere any time soon, and even though it's a gigantic thing, it's only at around 54 dollars per share. I'm thinking of buying a bit more shares of this than I normally would, around 19-20 or so, so I can get a decent amount of dividends and put those back into investing. Plus they pay out dividends very soon about next month, and quarterly at that. I have tried to play it as intelligently as I could, and if something may seem dumb, to me it made logical sense. I've mostly been investing in ETF's, with only Visa being my one blue chip company. I was wondering if it would be wise to then buy a few of KO as my next blue chip company, and buy more for the dividends aspect too. I do not want to invest in random stuff like the rip-toe currency stuff (can't say it because word filters are stupid), and I just want to be a long term investor. So again, as intelligently as I could think

My comparison, my portfolio right now is:  
2.51 shares of VOO (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF)  
3.02 shares of V (Visa)  
1.05 Shares of SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF)  
2.53 shares of VTV (Vanguard Value ETF)  
(I plan on buying a few shares of KO but here's where I come to ask if it's worth it to buy more, around 19-20 or just buy a few like I did with the others)

Thanks for the help and if you read this far, thanks for reading this far too. I've also noticed IRM for similar reasons, but I don't know much about IRM compared to Coca Cola."

Share price has little do with how big a company is. DIS is trading at 170$ per share (x3 KO) and yet their market cap is very similar. How big companies are is valued in market cap, revenue, etc not share price. PYPL trades at 250$ per share and their market cap is similar to KO's. Goldman Sachs trades at 360$ and is half of KO's market cap."

Two of your index funds, VOO and SPY, are the same thing. VOO has a net expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY has 0.09%. I would sell those and buy FNILX which is the same but 0% expense ratio. VTV is a basket of good solid companies with an expense ratio of 0.04%. V is a good choice. KO is good too. It‚Äôs gone up in the past few months but it might go up more. I bought KO at the end of January and my position is up 12%. IBM was down because folks thought it was done, but maybe it still has life, so it‚Äôs been going up too. I bought IBM at the beginning of February and my position is up 21%. Anyway, I would suggest roughly equal amounts of money in FNILX, VTV, V and KO (or something else you choose). When you have a little more money, choose another company in another sector and keep building from there. A lot of folks just like the index funds, but personally I like to own shares in individual companies. You decide!"
2021-05-21 12:21:55,stocks,"Reddit is a soapbox... you will get all sort of responses. So lets look at the fundamentals instead.

* KO products are likely not going away in the next 50 years. 
* KO has a strong worldwide manufacturing and distribution network.
* Lately, they are divesting lower margin operations and turning them over to 3rd parties (bottling). This will increase margins at the cost of rev.
* Generally they grow and adapt by creating or buying new drinks but they generally havent diversified outside of drinks. This not necessarily a bad thing just that they are more cyclical as the pandemic proved.
* Their rev was hit pretty hard by COVID due to restaurant closures. It will likely climb moving forward.
* Historically dividend keep growing and there is little danger in losing it.
* Historically they are a net share buyback company which is also good.
* Total return the last 10 years is about 8.5% annualized.

I would say this is a good purchase. 8.5% is pretty good given that this was a rather slow decade for them. That said, PEP is outperforming them right now thanks to their diversification into snacks. I also like KDP due to their dominance in coffee. At the same time, consider that KO has a stronger brand than the other two and will likely make a nice post covid recovery.

Going forward, I think the markets are either going sideways or down. I dont see much upside without major inflation. These 3 stocks are a great play during a sideways market and generally outperform in a crash due to safety. Inflation doesnt really hurt them very much because they can pass on the cost easily to customers. All in all, I would buy all 3."

2021-05-21 10:27:17,stocks,"Share price doesn't matter. AAPL is a $2 trillion but it's share price is $125, while NVDA is a $370 billion company but it's share price is $600.

Also it's blue chip, not blue collar.

Also, dividends don't really matter. Don't invest in companies just for the dividend.

If you do invest in dividend companies, be careful of high yields. Those companies probably will not be able to sustain such high yields.

There's no reason to have VOO and SPY. They're the same thing, so pick one. VOO has a smaller expense ratio, so you might want to go with that. If you're selling covered calls, maybe go with SPY.

It might be worth it for you to read up a little bit more before investing."

But assuming that‚Äôs insignificant, they‚Äôre not a growth stock, so their dividend and stability entices investors. 

The amount you are investing is also quite small, so if you expect your salary to increase in the future, many of your moves now will be dwarfed by your moves in the future. So since this is for learning purposes, it might be worth looking into how dividends are taxed."

2021-05-21 10:23:10,stocks,"If you can only afford single digit shares of these things, then you should spend the money on other things in life rather than buying 1 share of this or 1 share of that.

2021-05-21 10:48:21,stocks,I prefer mutual funds for income growth.  Diversity is your friend when investing for income.
2021-05-21 14:57:33,stocks,"Higher dividend plays make more sense when you have a ton of money you can leave lying around up front. You won't realize any real payoffs until it's generating a sizable dividend and that require a LOT of shares. KO was an amazing buy for someone like Buffet who has seen like a 100X return, but definitely not as appealing nowadays. 

Let's do some quick math as an example. With a yearly dividend of $1.64, 20 shares nets you a quarterly dividend of  $8.20 ($32.80 per year). KO stock is currently hovering around $55 and had an all-time high of $60. There's not going to be a whole lot of growth unless something big changes at Coca-Cola so let's just assume it ping-pongs between $55-58 over a year. You're pretty much gaining only like $60 on the total stock value ($55 to $58 x 20 shares) and $32.80 from dividends. In other words, you're up about $93 after a year on an investment of $1080. 

Earning money is good and all, but I think you could do WAY better by investing that $1080 into something that has higher growth potential long term. If you had the capacity to buy something like 2-3K shares at once now we're talking, but at really low share numbers it's not really worth it. 

If you don't have anything you want to invest in right now it's fine to park money in a dividend stock, but be sure to prioritize whatever makes sense for your investment horizon. As young person getting into it, the idea of dividends is super appealing but the reality is that you need a sizable deposit for it to be worth it."
2021-05-21 16:21:52,stocks,Yea but only 5% of your total portfolio
2021-05-21 19:42:07,stocks,My suggestion is for a long play to hold on your acquisition and watch the bulls chop the share price by about 10%. As the EU is conducting an investigation into KO‚Äôs business tactics. That‚Äôs my opinion on what the price is going to be but I play the contrarian side of investing and see discounts in the negativity that markets move.
2021-05-21 12:51:21,stocks,"Whats with the people obsessed with dividents?

Firstly. You have a tiny portfolio. The dividents that will get paid out won't amount to anything noteworthy. Sure if you have 300k, then holding 300k worth of a 4% dividend stock is nice. 

Secondly. You said you want to reinvest the dividents. Well then it makes no sense to go for a stock or ETF that pays out dividents. Accumulating stocks/ETFS basically take the dividents and re-invest them for you automatically, with the benefit of skipping taxation which increases the compound interest effect. Over many years, this makes a big difference. 

Dividend stocks don't pay out magic money made out of thin air. It gets subtracted from the stock price. There is no real benefit to an accumulating stock"

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

2021-05-21 09:16:56,stocks,"I know this may seem somewhat hypocritical because I'm posting it here, and it's annoying when these posts get awards and upvotes in the very same platform they claim to be renouncing... but I think I'm ready for a break.

I started investing in individual stocks thanks to the GameStop saga (shoot me), and since then I've learned a lot and rebalanced my portfolio a gajillion times. Now I've got something serious and long-term, with some cash on the side ready to pounce when and if there's a correction.

It's been fun, and I'm up slightly, but more and more it's becoming a drain to constantly check my tickers and performance and the news and what not.  I'll still be on top of the most important things but I think the constant checking in has got to go.

I do a lot of sport too and I injured my foot this week. Taking a break from exercise made me realize it's okay (and even desirable) just to be lazy and do nothing. So that's what I'm going to do.

No promises, I'm just a human being and as neurotic as the worst of them.  But I think I'm ready for a break.  Thanks guys for helping me learn, it's been fun, and best of luck to everyone."

2021-05-21 10:59:42,stocks,"Why were people saying SNOW, CRWD, and CRM would fall to 150 last week again? Was it just bears on a red day saying the worst things about stocks when they at the bottom? Because the negative sentiment around cloud stocks was through the roof last week."

2021-05-21 11:51:25,stocks,The extra premium on Tesla kind of pisses me off sometimes.  I got some OTM 600 calls on Wed right at the open/bottom and they are half the value and probably will expire worthless after almost a 10% move lol.  I need to stick to stocks that will pay on like 2-5% moves while still OTM.   Maybe one day I'll be a big boy and just get deep ITM options.

And with that certain coin looking especially unstable right now, I think the odds tilt toward TSLA going down more.

All of big tech does this. Look at msft with teams (killed slack, which refused to be brought out), fb with insta stories (to go against snap which refused to be brought out) etc etc.

Might be good for investors, but puts waaaaay too much power in the hands of unelected corporate executives.

Edit: I'm saying I'm against all of big tech being so big (concurring with the above), rather than just apple. I think they should all be broken up."
2021-05-21 11:45:31,stocks,How? They're trying to bully their way onto an Apple product to use it as a vehicle for income without giving any cut to Apple. Fuck Epic. I can't stand that company.

2021-05-21 09:56:46,stocks,"Brought 10 shares myself. Hoping it runs similar to AAPL and TSLA, although market sentiment was very different at the time. Even if market corrects, I think it shouldn't drop below 550 (support hit a few weeks ago during inflation sell off)."

2021-05-21 10:18:48,stocks,The after split dip will probably be higher than it is right now if recent history is any indication.

2021-05-21 11:18:20,stocks,"Why? You can just sell the call and the shares. The only risk here is if this happens when the market is closed, but I don't feel like paying attention 13 hours a day. Also, stops don't work with the market closed, so in practice there isn't really an increased downside risk, just a capped upside."
2021-05-21 10:18:53,stocks,I also get my shares sold at the strike price which isn‚Äôt bad either.
2021-05-21 11:48:16,stocks,"IMO you should avoid stocktwits at all costs it is useless. Lets say a stock is $50 per share that section would just a bunch of people going stock to 100 by end of week on a green day. Or stock to zero on a red day.

2021-05-21 19:29:11,stocks,"Mainly what I feel is undervalued with exceptional growth potential over the next 3-5 years. I already have my weight in other high conviction ones like MSFT, NVDA, SQ, NET, TSLA, etc. Granted I had 20x return on TSLA over 5 years but sold most of it within the last few months.

I have some CHWY but I‚Äôm doubling my position. Chewy has superior pricing and customer service. They‚Äôre 40% off ATH. Their earnings were great with plenty of market share to go. Plus they‚Äôre expanding their services.

Lion Electric is my golden egg. I‚Äôve put a ton into this already and am adding as much as I possibly can. If you haven‚Äôt done any DD on LEV, check them out. They‚Äôve been working behind the scenes for a decade and they‚Äôre about to explode. They‚Äôre finishing the largest manufacturing facility in the USA this year and they have a ton of orders coming from Amazon, IKEA, large school districts, etc. There are a ton of school buses, refuse trucks, and cargo trucks to replace in the coming decades. Based on current market cap and the growth trajectory, I think this is an easy 10x in 3-5 years. I‚Äôve been really impressed with how well they‚Äôre running the company."

2021-05-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Oatly (OTLY) valuation makes any sense? Oatly IPO happened yesterday. Market cap at close: ~ 12 billion USD. Pre-market it‚Äôs up 10%.

In comparison, Beyond Meat (BYND) currently sits at ~ 6,8 billion USD market cap.

Both have similar revenue. In 2020 Oatly‚Äôs revenue was 421,4 million USD. Beyond Meat‚Äôs 2020 revenue: 406,8 million USD. 

How does it makes sense that OTLY has almost double the market cap of BYND? Especially considering that Beyond Meat has a bit more specific (harder to replicate) product. It seems that many conpanies could produce plant milk if they wished so. 

Toughts? Another example of IPO valuation mania?

I have no position in BYND or OTLY."
2021-05-21 05:44:22,stocks,"Purely anecdotal here, but from where I sit, Beyond Meat seems to still be a niche product whereas Oatly has already crossed through to that liminal space between niche/mainstream (perhaps you could even make a case that it is a mainstream product by now).   
  
Already 3 years ago, I started seeing Oatly in coffee shops in Shanghai as well as being sold through online retailers there. And I'm not just talking nth wave trendy coffee shops--even my local corner spot went through cartons of their barista edition each daily despite charging the equivalent of an extra 50-80 cents for it. Half a year ago, I migrated to Hamburg and see it everywhere here as well. More so than in Shanghai, it also has premium retail space in the supermarkets with a wider portfolio of products (they're not solely making plant milks anymore, it seems). So in an average retailer here at least, I feel like Oatly has more skus and moves more product than Beyond does.  
  
Re having an easier to replicate product: Coca-Cola is easier to replicate than, say, alcohol free wine, but that doesn't mean it ought to be valued less."
2021-05-21 08:50:26,stocks,"Especially in Europe, the **supermarket‚Äôs own generic brands** (e.g. at Aldi, Tesco, Rewe, Alnatura) are increasingly catching up and gaining market share. More so, they are a cheaper alternative to Oatly‚Äôs products (with a high price premium) and hence appeal to a large customer base.   
Oatly cannot compete on **price** (*yet? Maybe they do a similar move to Tesla √† la Model S -> Model 3?*) and imo also not **taste** (largely undifferentiated ‚Äì but that is debatable). Its success will depend on its brand, and product expansion. Partnerships (like the Starbucks deal in the US) are interesting and will push Oatly‚Äôs brand strength. But overall, does Oatly have a moat?"
2021-05-21 06:26:51,stocks,"I know people who are huge fans of the product. They will only drink oatly and that thing is always sold out in all the super markets. I think it‚Äôs just a far superior product and demand is high. For people who are lactose intolerant or environmental, this thing is a game changer. I think this thing will be huge in Asia, where most of the population is lactose intolerant. Plus milk is just the beginning. They can replace all dairy products including ice cream."
2021-05-21 06:44:59,stocks,"I haven‚Äôt had a detailed look, but Oatly grew at 106% in 2020 compared to 37% growth for Beyond. Oatly also makes products that are highly palatable to anyone.

2021-05-21 05:38:56,stocks,Beyond Meat is more of a niche in the fact majority of customers are vegetarian or vegans whereas Oatly is more widely consumed.

2021-05-21 10:01:48,stocks,Just a hunch : maybe cost of goods sold is higher for beyond than oatly. Meaning oatly as better margins and hence more money at the end of the year for publicities and increasing growth.

2021-05-21 07:55:38,stocks,"Commented this same to someone else here but I'll just say this again that OP sees this

I work in restaurant business and oatly makes one of the best vegan products. They aren't doing just milk they are doing creams, yogurts, snack drinks, cream cheese, cream fresh, ice cream etc. Nowadays if you let customers decide are they using regular milk or oatly to their coffee most of people choose oatly. It's something like 4:5 customers that choose oatly instead of regular dairy products what I've noticed. 

Even at our home my wife is using oatly products instead regural milk. I've tried to hide competitive products without telling her and she notice if it's not oatly. 

And trust me when I say that I've tried a lot of vegan/non diary products and oatly has been the best. 

If I have to say something negative about oat products that people are arguing are they actually so healthy as they say or are they even worse than regular diary products. 

What comes to beyond the meat, I don't think it so special and there's a lot or atleas few products that can compete with them. Don't ask names but I've tried probably all of them and BtM didn't leave any special marks in to my mind.

Edit.

2021-05-21 13:40:42,stocks,"They went from $200 million sales in 2019 to $400 million in sales in 2020. One of their biggest markets for growth is the USA. They're already on trajectory to do $550 million in 2021. 

Keep in mind people are traveling less, which results in buying less coffee from shops just look at Starbucks revenue slow down. The lockdowns are a problem for Oatley, whereas things opening up only mean increased sales for Oatley. 

This company could easily be doing over $1 billion annual sales in 3 years time. 

People want to say, like the OP, Beyond did $400 million last year just like Oatley so why is $OTLY valued more? Well, BYND did $300 million in 2019 vs OTLY $200. 

OTLY has a much stronger sales growth trajectory than BYND does.

I'm bullish on the company because there is a very high ceiling of growth and lots of market opportunities open. It has Oprah, Natalie Portman and Jay-Z as investors as well, like em or hate em, if they do any kind of promotion for the company its going to result in big sales.

I see it going to $30 and then down to $12-$15 before it slow climbs again to $20-$25 over a 6 month to 1 year period. Long term, OTLY has a lot of potential and promise. 

Oats have less allergies as compared to other milks made from nuts. This cow replacement milk could be the replacement winner years down the road."

Why would you need oil in a milk?

but somehow Oatly contain oil, and not a good one like EVOO, but rapeseed oil, the cheapest kind of oil (even worse than palm oil), and not cold-pressed, but the one extracted via heat-pressed (meaning it is already oxidixed). One serving of oatly contain more oil than one serving of french fries.

Also, contain the level of sugar that puts Coke too shame (per serving).

If you want to consume vegan milk, just go with regular homemade soy or almond milk, much more healthy.

The product is trash, the company is trash (paying Oprah to sell garbage in the name of health), the stock is much so.

I live in California (the source of 80% of the world's almond supply), and I believe the cost to farm almonds to make ""almond water"" (with little nutritional value), in what is essentially a desert, will eventually be passed onto consumers to a degree they're not willing to accept, 

OTLY will be there to capture those consumers. Besides water access issues, I don't like almond milk's future considering the limited harvest window of California almonds during peak fire season. It's a shortage waiting to happen.

I like the company. I like the product. I dislike its competition. I own 1,000 shares, and I believe this is a great long-term play."

Another plus for Oatly, they're already in the 3 continents, Beyond Meat is very hard to find (At least here in Europe, I haven't seen it in a single place yet unfortunately, hopefully they'll expand). Oatly in the other hand, always runs out and it's widely available here (I'm living in Spain and have looked for both products in Italy, Portugal and here)."

If you think about fake meat you probably think of Oatly, If you think about fake meat you probably think about BYND or Impossible foods.

Oatly is head and shoulders above the competition, specifically for making latt√©s and milk tea. They have a unique flavour for sure. My girlfriend literally orders it by the case from the one retailer around us that carries it. Their biggest problem is that they are not ubiquitous in all regions and straight up cannot seem to keep up with demand.

I will say though that it wouldn‚Äôt be particularly difficult to upend their influence if another company comes out with a comparably quality product. That just hasn‚Äôt happened yet IMO. If Oatly can grow their business beyond where it is currently (pretty much just oat milk afaik)and also better organize their operations and fulfillment, they might have something here."

Not saying that‚Äôs a huge sample size or whatever but at this point I see more young women drinking it than regular milk. They‚Äôre gonna make their boyfriends/husbands buy it, start families and raise their kids on the stuff.  Classic long $BECKY play imo.

It's something like 4:5 customers that choose oatly instead of regular dairy products what I've noticed. 

Even at our home my wife is using oatly products instead regural milk. I've tried to hide competitive products without telling her and she notice if it's not oatly. 

And trust me when I say that I've tried a lot of vegan/non diary products and oatly has been the best. 

If I have to say something negative about oat products that people are arguing are they actually so healthy as they say or are they even worse than regular diary products. 

What comes to beyond the meat, I don't think it so special and there's a lot or atleas few products that can compete with them. Don't ask names but I've tried probably all of them and BtM didn't leave any special marks in to my mind.

Edit.

I have 50 shares of oatly... Well just because what I told

So will it become a ""**RedBull**"" (*undifferentiated product in terms of value, but strongly differentiated brand*)? Its marketing seems to suggests a similar path.

Oatly is growing fast in this market. It's a high valuation but they have decent growth numbers so far, and ample growth opportunities. Oatly's deal with Starbucks (US-wide) will boost them quite a bit."
2021-05-21 07:48:32,stocks,I make my own oat milk in a pinch and usually buy an off brand version for convenience and neither are as good (or expensive) as Oatly honestly. If you like drinking straight milk (I don't) it's more palatable and better in coffee. Any version is fine in cooking in my opinion though. Oatly has added b12 which is nice.

Rapeseed is canola. It's horrible. I mostly consume avocado oil, cold pressed coconut oil, grass fed butter, and grass fed tallow. 

PUFAs, MCTs, Omega-3, 6, 9, etc-- all these fats serve different functions in the body and aren't interchangeable. This hype about Beyond and Oatly reminds me of the original marketing of margarine. We now know how unhealthy margarine and trans fats are.

Personally, if I want a plantbased milk, I'd only use coconut, pecan, and walnut. I wouldn't even use almond due to the high omega-6 profile."

2021-05-21 07:44:53,stocks,I don't think so. Just because a lot of places sell it doesn't mean it's sold everywhere the way coca cola is. The second part of what you said applies to Oatly too. It has potential to capture larger market with new products and broader adoption.
2021-05-21 13:40:21,stocks,"They went from $200 million sales in 2019 to $400 million in sales in 2020. One of their biggest markets for growth is the USA. They're already on trajectory to do $550 million in 2021. 

Keep in mind people are traveling less, which results in buying less coffee from shops just look at Starbucks revenue slow down. The lockdowns are a problem for Oatley, whereas things opening up only mean increased sales for Oatley. 

This company could easily be doing over $1 billion annual sales in 3 years time. 

People want to say, like the OP, Beyond did $400 million last year just like Oatley so why is $OTLY valued more? Well, BYND did $300 million in 2019 vs OTLY $200. 

OTLY has a much stronger sales growth trajectory than BYND does.

I'm bullish on the company because there is a very high ceiling of growth and lots of market opportunities open. It has Oprah, Natalie Portman and Jay-Z as investors as well, like em or hate em, if they do any kind of promotion for the company its going to result in big sales.

I see it going to $30 and then down to $12-$15 before it slow climbs again to $20-$25 over a 6 month to 1 year period. Long term, OTLY has a lot of potential and promise.

Second, from an r&d and ops perspective, it's not that easy to switch. They're doing plant genetics, agricultural optimization for oats. Their production line processes oats.

HOFV has initiated a Hall of Fame Fantasy League and is likely seeking a sports betting license from the state if Ohio which is in the process of passing a sports betting bill.  The bill is likely to finish passing in June.

The sports gambling business is just the cherry on top. I will continue to pay a higher multiple on DKNG (one of only 3 companies I do this for), because the growth is exponential.

2021-05-21 04:57:41,stocks,"Let's check out the numbers comparing it to one of the maddest gamblingcountries in the world: UK - a country where online betting is legalizedand they gamble much more than other European countries.47% of Brits have gambled in some way in the last 4 weeks

.On average, Brits spend ¬£2.60 per week on gambling, totaling over ¬£135.20per year. According to Businessfirstonline online gambling accounts for38% of the total gambling market. However that is the total gambling market including casinos, sport betting etc. Exchanging the currency would result in 180$ per person and now the online percentage would bearound $68 per person. In 2015 sports betting made 45% of all online gambling in the UK, so we now have around $30 per person.

The US has around 320 million people. Multiple $30 with 320 and we get 9600 million spend in the US on Online Sports betting.Which would be 9.5 billion for the whole industry in sales. In the UK profit margins are:WilliamHill 4.5% and Playtec is negative but has around 5% operating margins.These have several offline branches as well, so we say 12% is profit which is extremely generous over the long run due to promotions and advertisment Taking the theoretical size of 9.5b of online sports betting and applying 12% (which is very generous) would result in around 1.14b in revenue. Even if it would be double it is still a low number. Average P/E ratio ofInternetB2C betting sites was 15.6 from 1999-2016 according to CreditSuisse, that would result in an industry that should be around 16b for online sports betting.Draftkings is valued at 17bso in terms of online sports betting it is getting bigger than the theoretical industry of mad gambling Brits with US numbers. So while the opportunity seems to be there, the price is already ahead of itself.

&#x200B;

Even if they expand into other sectors it will be hard to justify the valuation as there are no monopolies in online-betting."

2021-05-21 12:08:53,stocks,"I'm not a huge fan of comparing the UK and US betting markets, they are very different betting markets. Most estimates I've seen for the current betting handle in the US is somewhere in the range of $180-$250B between legal and illegal bets. On an assumed 6-8% take home that makes total revenue $10.8-$20B in its current structure. This doesn't take into account all of the growth opportunities you mentioned as well as people who want to bet but don't have access/choose not to use illegal sites as. Also, in-venue betting in MD and AZ (already legal is DC and IL) was recently legalized and more states will likely follow suit. Also, while it won't be a monumental amount, Canada is getting closer to single game wagering which will likely add a side pot to revenue.

Also, growth in betting in the US has not slowed. Nevada (an established market for decades) is showing 15% growth from 2019 Q4 to 2020 Q4. New Jersey showed over 50% growth in that same time.

It's difficult to pinpoint where US revenue is eventually going to land but I don't think $9.5B is even in the ballpark. 

Also, wherever margins land is going to be incredibly difficult to predict. William Hill for example got hit hard with branch closures and UK restrictions on kiosk betting even before COVID. DraftKings and most other US entrants are clearly putting a higher emphasis on mobile betting.

I don't disagree with the point of OP that DraftKings is aggressively valued, it is. But I think that there is justification behind it."

No matter where your money is invested at. If you feel it would perform better anywhere else, you should actually make the move. (Though keeping diversification and risk levels in mind)  


Also please remember, by taking a loss you can actually take advantage of tax loss harvesting, which might be handy if you need to sell profits in the future.  


Dont get emotionally attached to something and wait for it to recover. Remember a 50% loss needs a 100% recovery. While a 66% loss needs a 200% recovery.

I day trade so my approach is different from what you are doing but the bottom line is:  Cutting loss is an integral part of investing/trading.  You can't DCA down from your paycheck long term because there's never enough $ from a few paychecks to change the cost basis when your portfolio is older than a few years. 

What you need to think about is why you are cutting loss.  Cutting loss to add to your winners is the opposite of portfolio re-balancing - which is basically selling some of your winners and buy the losers (the dip).   At the end of the day, you'll need to pick one approach and stay the path.  Changing the approach midway is costly."

2021-05-21 00:00:00,stocks,"How will reopening affect Amazon? I am also posting this on r/investing, so sorry about the duplicate if it applies to you.

Hi all,

I am looking forward to opening a position on Amazon but I still have a tiny small doubt in my mind, I am wondering if posting my doubt here can help me clear it or better understand it.

The doubt I have is that wouldn't reopening cause a decrease of deliveries on [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/)? [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) seems to be hot last year because people don't want to go to stores to buy stuff but once the store opens, wouldn't the traffic of [amazon.com](https://amazon.com/) go down? Also, since people are at home more, AWS was getting a lot more traffic from their popular clients such as Netflix. But once the economy reopens, people won't stay at home as much and therefore not go on to AWS-hosted websites as much, right? Other services such as Twitch and Amazon Prime should have lower traffic too because of people spending less time at homes. The only few services I think of might benefit are Whole Foods and IMDb.com.

But somehow, analysts seem very bullish on Amazon's short-term. I am seeing a bunch of $4000-$5000 price targets. Why are analysts giving such high price targets when so much of Amazon's revenue depends on the environment of staying at home?

Thanks for sharing your thoughts!"
2021-05-20 23:47:37,stocks,"They will be fine / stronger. Supply lines, product availability and their delivery times will only get better.

As much as the public wants to get back out there, they also want all their junk next morning when ordered at 10PM watching Netflix."
2021-05-21 08:29:57,stocks,"This is a good thought on your part, but you‚Äôre waaaaaaay behind others in thinking about it. Reopening would have been priced in for quite a long while. 

You have to be forward looking. What does May 2022 look like? Either be two steps ahead, or don‚Äôt worry about timing and only invest in long holds."

2021-05-20 23:35:11,stocks,Reopening is already baked into the stock price.
2021-05-20 23:40:27,stocks,Already priced in. I‚Äôm opening a position also
2021-05-21 06:54:35,stocks,Analysts are putting high price targets on it because they just loaded the truck at lower prices. Once it reaches their targets now they will sell then open short positions / puts and modify their targets back to their oringinal buy price before selling. Theyre self serving shills.

My reason for being in it is actually the individual now behind it Bill Foley, his companies are consistently the largest banking transaction processing companies (Credit Card, Mortgages, etc...)

2021-05-21 09:24:09,stocks,"Yup, your reasoning is pretty much the same as mine. Bill foley, an experienced veteran who‚Äôs on board in the company. I haven‚Äôt decided yet whether to invest in it or not. That‚Äôs why I am doing research on this company."
2021-05-21 00:01:24,stocks,David tepper isn‚Äôt stupid when he sells all his square and buys paysafe. They‚Äôre pivoting to gaming/gambling they control 80% of the market for that already. Paysafe valuation + growth will be dependent on what they are planning to acquire.  330 million net institutional addition during q1 thats a lot for a spac.

2021-05-20 23:47:14,stocks,Yep. Almost all online betting companies use Paysafe.
2021-05-21 00:24:35,stocks,"I like it a lot, I think it has great potential to compete with PayPal and Square. I also see their revenue increasing with more and more states legalizing gambling this year. Going public via SPAC really sets them up for more acquisitions and they have really taken advantage of this. I‚Äôm in it for the long term."

2021-05-21 00:00:00,stocks,"(DJCO) My mini-essay investment thesis for The Daily Journal - Why you should buy a dying newspaper business Investment Thesis for Daily Journal (DJCO)

Introduction:  The Daily Journal is viewed by the general public as a dying newspaper business.  It is a dying newspaper business, but the Daily Journal has pivoted itself to a SaaS business, but is trading at a valuation far below most other publicly traded Saas businesses.  We will investigate why the Daily Journal is a worthwhile investment at its current valuation.

Management:  Normally, we‚Äôd begin by looking at the business, but management within the Daily Journal is incredibly strong, so this will be our beginning.  The Chairman of the Board in Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.  He bought the Daily Journal in 1977 for $2 million dollars and has been the Chairman ever since.  The lesser known name leading the Daily Journal is Gerald Salzman.  He joined the Daily Journal in 1986 as their President, CEO, CFO, Treasurer.  As such, there is likely no one else who knows the Daily Journal as well as Gerald Salzman.  As an added bonus to the quality of the two men leading the Daily Journal, their executive compensation is almost unheard of.  The Board of Directors receive a payment of either $5000 or $0.  Gerald Salzman, the CEO, receives a salary of $250,000.  These are acceptable salaries due to the large amount of insider ownership within the Daily Journal.

The Business:  The Daily Journal has three business segments, 1) The Daily Journal Newspaper, 2) Equity Investments, and 3) Journal Technologies.

---

The Daily Journal Newspaper is a series of mostly California based legal newspapers.  Their revenue comes from advertising from display advertising (i.e. traditional advertising found in most newspapers), classified advertising, trustee notice sale advertising, legal notice advertising, and circulation advertising.  The sad but unfortunate truth for investors is that this portion of their business is worth very little.  The good news, however, is that most investors outside of the Daily Journal are not interested in investing in a dying newspaper and thus has led to the undervaluation of the Daily Journal.

I won‚Äôt spend any more time on this segment except to say that the newspaper‚Äôs most successful year isemi-modern history was during 2008 due to an extreme uptick in the need for legal advertising relating to the foreclosure of many homes.  It is possible that if another recession strikes, the newspaper business of the Daily Journal could provide some financial cushion to keep the Daily Journal in strong health.

---

Equities have been a growing proportion of the Daily Journal‚Äôs intrinsic value.  Charlie Munger‚Äôs investing prowess that has benefited Berkshire is also at work within the Daily Journal.  We have insight into the Daily Journal‚Äôs American investments thanks to their most recent 13F filing, which was released within the last week.  At this time, the Daily Journal holds $197 million worth of American equities, mostly concentrated in financial services similarly to the holdings of Berkshire Hathaway.  Another notable holding is a new and growing position in Alibaba.  

While it is not explicitly confirmed, there is a VERY strong evidence that the Daily Journal also holds a sizable position in BYD, a Hong Kong traded electric car manufacturer.  This would not appear in its 13F filings, so its size cannot be confirmed, however we can make an educated guess.  The exact value of his BYD investment is unknown, however it is assumed to be be roughly $140 million.  In the most recent filing, the Daily Journal notes that it sold $20 million of one of its positions to reinvest into another security.  The suspicion is that this was a shift from BYD to BABA.  As such, we will value the BYD position at $120, though in truth, it may be slightly higher as BYD traded at a fewer dollars higher of a valuation prior to the most recent filing.  Nonetheless, we will assume its value is $120 million.  This brings the Daily Journal‚Äôs equity portfolio to a value of $317 million.

The Daily Journal also has $27 million in cash according to their latest annual report and they hold some office buildings in Los Angeles and in Utah which THEY value at $16.5 million.  I emphasized that they value the building because, as I‚Äôll discuss below, the company has some questionable accounting practices.  In the instance of the office buildings in Los Angeles as an example, they valued the buildings at $16.5 million roughly 20 years ago and that figure has never been adjusted.  The result is that they are likely undervaluing the true value of their real estate holdings.  If we increase the value of these holding to $30 million, which seems like a fair appraisal for their buildings based on current market rate, this results in a total equity and asset value of $374 million.

Their liabilities consist of ~$60 million in deferred capital gains (0% interest), a $29.5 million margin loan (3% interest), and a $1.5 million mortgage (4% interest).  The deferred capital gains will not be paid anytime soon as Charlie Munger likes to hold stocks and when he sells, typically he will move into another qualified investment.  The margin loan was used to acquire businesses to build the Saas business and is serviced by the dividends from the bank stocks in the equity portfolio.  The mortgage is self explanatory.  Total liabilities amount to $91 million

Before jumping into the last portion of the Daily Journal‚Äôs business segment, I want to note that the Daily Journal has a market cap of $414 million.  As such, to reach its market cap valuation, assuming no value is assigned to the legal newspaper business (it has a value, it‚Äôs just not a high value and in all honesty, I don‚Äôt know what a fair value is for that business), the Journal Technologies business only needs to be worth $131 million to come a fair market value at its current market cap valuation.

---

Journal Technologies is the hidden gem of the Daily Journal.  It is a legal Saas business being sold to municipalities via the RFP process.  It is a case management system built off of a central e-Suites product that is then configured to meet the client‚Äôs needs.

It has a unique business model that results in, once again, an undervaluation of the company.  After being awarded an RFP, the company will then define the scope of the product, establish servers on site, and install its product, and then configure it to the clients needs.  All of this work takes 4 to 8 years to complete and during this time, the municipality is not billed.  On a relevant note to the questionable accounting practices above, the Daily Journal does not report the forthcoming revenue on its financial statements, thus these contracts have not necessarily been taken into account to determine the Daily Journal‚Äôs current market valuation.

When its e-Suites product goes live, the Daily Journal will charge an implementation fee and subsequently bill a licensing fee for the next 10 years (with built in price adjustments to account for inflation).  Currently, Daily Journal has over $100 million in forthcoming revenue which, due to their billing practices, is a very high-margin revenue once billing starts.  These contracts are found in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Tasmania currently, though more may have been signed and not discovered.  Credit to Matthew Peterson for taking the time to search across the web looking for tenders awarded to the Daily Journal, as there is not a central repository to identify these contracts.

Moving forward, the assumption is that the Daily Journal will continue onboarding new jurisdictions, there will be an increase in licenses purchased for existing contracts after e-Suites launches, consulting fees for upgrades and modifications will increase, and other e-solutions will be integrated with e-Suites to increase revenue (such as e-payment for fines and tickets).

While the Journal Technologies already has $30-some million in revenue, this figure will increase with time.  Additionally, these municipalities will likely continue using the e-Suite services once they go live after the time and cost of configuration, meaning revenue that is on the books today is revenue that will be on the books likely after the 10 years of licensing has expired.  Presently, Journal Technologies is a $200-$300 million business based on the figures and assumptions above.  Under this assumption, the Daily Journal is valued somewhere between $483 million and $583 million, meaning it is currently undervalued by 17% to 41%.

---

There are a few risks that need to be mentioned.  One is liquidity.  The Daily Journal has a $400 million dollar market cap and is too small for many large financial institutions to monitor.  It also has a $300 share price which, while irrelevant to value, will scare away many newer retail investors who invest $20 to $50 at a time.  Beyond these two issues, the Daily Journal has quite a bit of insider ownership or is owned by firms with long-term visions, thus they are not willing to sell shares on a daily basis.  The result is that only about 5,000 shares are traded on a daily basis.  This means that if you need to liquidate your position in a pinch, you may have to sell below the market rate.

The other glaring issue is age.  Charlie Munger is 97 years old and Gerald Salzman is 80 years old.  Beyond not being at the forefront of technological innovation on a personal level (some may view this as an issue when running a Saas business, personally I am not concerned as there job is to manage the people driving the Saas business), their old age means that in the coming years, their leadership may cease to exist.  No clear succession plan has been identified (this was raised during their last annual meeting by a concerned shareholder).  As management is a key strength within this business, this could be reason for pause for prospective shareholders.

Lastly, there is the $16 billion elephant in the room.  Tyler Technologies is their key competitor.  There are other smaller competitors who offer more limited solutions, but Tyler Technologies is the real competition in this space.  While their products are more modern and (likely) have better and flashier features, this is not necessarily what wins in RFP processes.  Instead, the Daily Journal‚Äôs practice of not charging the client until launch is a much more appealing catch for prospective clients.  While I‚Äôm sure Tyler Technologies will be a fine company in the long-term, its hard to argue that their fundamentals are nearly as attractive as the fundamentals of the Daily Journal.  The Daily Journal is valued at 8x sales, has a P/B of under 2, and has a P/E of 3.5.  By comparison, Tyler Technologies has a P/B of 8, is valued at 14x sales, and has a P/E of 91.  Tyler Technologies would need to continue growing at a very rapid pace to be a strong value investment (note that Tyler Technologies is still rapidly growing, though this rapid growth is slowing).  By comparison, the Daily Journal, if it continues at its current growth, is already a great investment.  As most clients are onboarded, growth is increasing and it is my belief that this will be a phenomenal investment.

Disclaimer: I hold shares of DJCO.  I am posting this because after my research, I think others could benefit from investing in this company (if they agree with my above analysis) AND because I want community feedback on thoughts about DJCO.  My intention is to hold DJCO for a minimum of 4 years, though more realistically I will hold this for a very long time since, as I noted above, the revenue for this company is incredibly sticky and I believe they have many avenues to increase their sales."

This article was originally published on Sept. 4, 2020."

No. Just no. Cameras on the driver isn't going to make their systems ""safer"" or more ""useful"".

For all the situations that FSD is advertised to be used in, and many that it isn't, their systems do an A+ job at both piloting the vehicle and alerting the driver to take over when the AI isn't confident what to do.

Auto-Steer and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, often referred to together as Autopilot, can't drive _everywhere_, but the number situations they can handle extremely well is impressive. Freeways have been a solved problem for Tesla for years. Lane changes, also solved for freeways and city streets. Stop signs, street lights, construction zones, speed limit signs, all solved with vision -- the car will come to a complete stop at a stop sign without intervention, or would slow down and alert the driver when entering a construction zone. Even roads with poor or no lane markings are handled quite well. If the car isn't confident, it prompts the driver to take over. It's a PHENOMENAL system.

Only uniformed people who hear ""Autopilot"" and jump to the conclusion that it should be able to take you from A to B without intervention complain. Nobody is claiming that it does that. It's a driver _assist_ system, it's not a replacement for a driver.

I've heard ""news"" reports of driverless crashes or of someone riding in the backseat w/o a driver, and I call B.S. Nobody is stupid enough to believe that is safe to do today. It's a prank, someone is getting paid to give Tesla bad press, and risk their life in the process. You can't get to your destination from the backseat, at best it would get off a freeway and stop in the off-ramp and wait for the driver to accelerate. If you're circumventing all the seatbelt checks, hand on wheel checks, seat sensor checks with special tools and claiming that a reasonable person would do all that and then climb over the seats without opening doors and think that what they are doing is remotely safe, you're straight up trolling.

Tesla should continue improving their AI vision based diver assist systems, because it's already a revolutionary product and it continues to improve month by month."

Safer because a car that stops and calls an emergency number when the driver isn‚Äôt paying attention to the road will protect the driver and those around him, both in cases of legit issues (sleepiness, health problems) and more critically from the fools who think is fun to abuse the system.

More useful because, lacking this monitoring system and given the frequent abuses, your Autopilot will eventually be made illegal.

If Tesla fails to deliver, I can see how that's a bit of a swindle, but as I've said before I am quite impressed with what has been delivered so far.

I'm sure Elon is very confident in the progress they have made in fully autonomous driving in private lots, but I agree, there are concerns, legal and otherwise, about fully autonomous driving on public roads.

It's speculation, but I from my experience driving his cars, I expect he will deliver, but when exactly, I can't say. I also don't think I'd feel comfortable riding in the backseat without a driver in the next decade, or perhaps ever. Having someone able to intervene in emergency situations is a sensible idea. But also, driving a Tesla is fun. I don't think I'd want to stop co-piloting a Tesla, even if it was safe. Driving is dangerous, but most of the danger comes from all the _other_ drivers in the road. I won't drive a motorcycle for the same reason. Even if I'm an A+ motorcycle driver, it's the less responsible _other_ drivers that may ruin my day.

However, I would feel comfortable driving to an airport and sending my car back home without passengers. Or, going to a theme park and sending my car off to find a parking spot. The car will patently, slowly, and safely drive it self. If there was an accident, it would be a minor fender bender, not a high speed fiery crash.

You are mistaken because the car already does that while driving itself. If you fall asleep at the wheel, the car will beep loudly, turn on the hazard lights, and bring the car to a complete stop. Although, it doesn't make a telephone call AFAIK.

>more critically from the fools who think is fun to abuse the system.

Trying to outsmart a bad actor with physical access to your device is futile. If there was a camera system, in addition to all the other systems, what would stop the abuser from setting up a screen in front of the camera that plays a video that tricks the sensors? Or removing the camera and replacing it with a Raspberry Pi that sends a false video feed? A motivated individual will always be able to beat the system. It's better to improve the driving safety systems for everyone than to try to outsmart the bad actors.

>lacking this monitoring system and given the frequent abuses, your Autopilot will eventually be made illegal.

Which is why traditional cruise control is illegal, because it gets abused and people crash and die? The argument that a system must be 100% safe or 100% foolproof is flawed. Drivers are still responsible for what their car does, even if they are ""not at the wheel"". Someone engaged autopilot, and they are the pilot-in-command of the vehicle. No one is advertising a fully autonomous driving system, at least not today. 

In Q1 2021 Tesla reports one accident for every 4,190,000 miles driven with Autopilot. The NHTSA reports an accident every 484,000 miles driven for traditional cars. It's a safety system and it works very very very well.

Autopilot, as it is today, would only be made illegal in a world where driving manually is also illegal. I doubt that will happen in my lifetime, but it would be fantastic if it did! Every car on the road would be fully self driving and the crash rate could be virtually zero. Autopilot drives 9x better than a human does, and keeps getting better.

Thats not to say its bad tech, its good, but when applied to something that can potentially kill people, we humans have very little tolerance for errors. ML is not good enough for this application.

Though this is not my area of expertise my gut tells me that it will fail long term in its current form. It might get legalized for a short while (as a political play), but that will get reversed if not by law, then by the companies themselves in due time. Long term outlook is it will require a human behind the wheel at all times.

We can go around the problems by designing infrastructure specifically for it. In other words, Waymo probably got it right with the sandbox idea but this will be extremely expensive. Tesla likely got it wrong. Again, not my area of expertise.

If your argument is self-driving tech is going to go the way of fusion and flying cars as being always '30 years away', then fair enough, I respectfully disagree. Just look at the level of investment into this technology vs flying cars...

If I replaced my words with ""driving assistance systems"" it wouldn't be the same argument though?... Obviously driving assistance systems are coming (since they already exist).

I do agree that advertising anything as 'self driving' right now is careless. In aviation there is a metric of intervention miles which is a measurement of how often an automation system has to be interacted with by a human to prevent an incident, this is measured in millions of miles typically...

Fundamentally, humans are terrible drivers. It is by far one of the most dangerous things we all socially agree to do. It really isn't that much of a stretch to think that a computer could out perform a human in the task. Maybe there would be a statistical trade for certain accident categories. But I do believe we will hit a critical point where self-driving vehicles are statistically safer than humans and it will grow from there."

It‚Äôs between *human drivers aided by driving assistance systems* and self driving.

The cooperation of a human driver with specific safety-oriented driving assistance systems, like driver fatigue and attention monitoring, emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, set a much higher bar for Self Driving to meet before it can be considered safer than humans.

This combination of human driver and driving aids, with today technology, is the best standard of driving safety. And that‚Äôs what responsible car manufacturers are offering and working to improve.

FSD is a bag of hype, it doesn‚Äôt currently exists, and going from interviews with people in the field it‚Äôs still a long way off.

Suggesting that cars today can drive themselves is irresponsible. It encouraged people to use their cars foolishly. Tesla‚Äôs system should be named in a way that‚Äôs totally unequivocal on the fact that It‚Äôs Not Self Driving.

Selling a car on the promise that someday will be full self driving (remember the nonsense that Tesla cars would become appreciating assets because owners would make money sending them out as robo taxis?) is a scam.
None of the cars on sale today are likely to ever be updated to legally be Full Self Driving.

And encouraging untrained customers to unrestrictedly beta test ‚Äúself driving‚Äù cars on public roads is borderline criminal. Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm even writing this.

These tailings pose serious environmental and health risks in the form of Randon emission, windblown dust dispersal and leaching of contaminants including heavy metals and arsenic into the water."

Few interesting (for example, energy) stocks hyped were:

Ticker | Value on 21 May, 2020 | Peak value | ROI Peak

PLUG | 4.17 | 73.18 | 1654%  

SPWR | 4.4 | 54.01 | 1127%

BEP  | 26.13 | 49.36 | 89%

With that said, I'm interested in SoFi (IPOE) and Grab (AGC) for the short term. For the long term, AST Spacemobile (ASTS) and AppHarvest (APPH).

In addition to Grab, I'd also keep an eye on the Gojek/Tokopedia merger. SE Asia has a lot of potential as an emerging market."

The only comparable sports franchise is Topshot and they're valued at $7.5B in their last private funding round. Topps has exclusive MLB rights and about a 100 other from Marvel to Street Fighter. When the NFT sells, the get the money on the front side, but also 6% everytime they're resold for perpetuity. The play really depends on the longevity of NFT values.

You should use the bigs like Fidelity, Charles Schwab, etc. Look at fees but using a basic index fund or blue chip investing strategy while maximising your inputs early while you are young is better than maximising in your 30s and 40s.

2021-05-20 20:02:19,stocks,"The other answers sounds legit. Just to add, I have 2 accounts in Fidelity. You can create as many accounts as you want for free. I suggest you create 1 ROTH IRA account where you can contribute 6k maximum per year. Secondly, 1 normal brokerage account where you can trade freely with no limits. 
They have customer service 24/7 so you can call anytime if you have questions. Also, you can choose a debit card and use your account as you would a bank. You can sign up for direct deposits and sign up for checks if you want. In 2021, there is no need for old Banks. Use these brokerage accounts to get higher than average returns on your sitting cash.

Also, nothing is limiting you from opening an account with different companies to see what you like best. I damn near have an account everywhere. In the end, I rate 1) Fidelity 2) SoFi ( because of easy loans) 3) Robinhood (because they Democratized the game to all).

Regarding investment options, you should start with ETFs seems you seem new. SPY (sp500), SPYG (Sp500 Growth only). 

You‚Äôll have to do your homework to make your own wins or losses. My recommendation, don‚Äôt let other ppl make your losses for you. Building wealth is not for the lazy.

Found the Fidelity page for VHYAX: [https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/921946786](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/921946786)

It also looks like Fidelity's Equity Income Fund (FEQIX) is the closest alternative to VHYAX. However, it looks to have a much higher expense ratio (0.6%) compared to Vanguard's (0.08%)."

I set a limit price order at 100.5 dollars for 1 share and another one at 101.5 dollars. Now whatever happens I will make profit, either 50 cents or 1.5 dollars.

Let's suppose that price keeps on increasing, it hits 101. 5 and my order gets fulfilled. Now I have 0 shares.. After that the price drops and reaches 100.5. What will Happen to the second limit price order that i Set?? I do not have a share now.. But I have a limit price order set.

2021-05-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 20, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 20, 2021**

Stocks snapped their modest three-day losing streak and jumped higher today, with market participants encouraged by the Weekly Unemployment Report and inflationary fears tempering. As I said yesterday, I was encouraged to see volatility decreasing this week after the wild swing the market experienced recently and am even more encouraged by today‚Äôs movement that the sharp sell-off was overdone. 

The Department of Labor released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which showed 444,000 new jobless claims filed, a fresh pandemic low and marginally better than the 450,000 expected by economists. To put this into context, in April of last year, more than 6 million individuals filed jobless claims in one week. While the improvement in the labor market has been extremely encouraging, in the Federal Reserve‚Äôs April meeting minutes (basically notes about what was discussed in the meeting) noted ‚Äúparticipants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee‚Äôs maximum-employment and price-stability goals‚Äù.  

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed‚Äôs argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed‚Äôs view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be ‚Äútransitory‚Äù and want to see a ‚Äústring‚Äù of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted ‚Äúa number of participants suggested‚Äù that as the economy continues to quickly, ‚Äúit might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase‚Äù, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, ‚ÄúWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.‚Äù As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

So my parents passed away when I was very young, and as a result a trust account was set up in my name for a portion of the social security money received monthly. They passed when I was 2/3, so it was quite a bit by the time I reached 18. Coupled with my great-grandparents (who were absolutely gems and raised me until 10/11) adding a bit from their estate, upon dispersement, there was a pretty penny.

I‚Äôve long been interested in investing, but I‚Äôm 24 and I haven‚Äôt had any real extra money since living on my own at 18. After this though, I‚Äôd like to put at least $1,000 into some kind of investment; after reading about the absolute SHITE that is interest on savings accounts‚Äîand I don‚Äôt want to blow all of it because I have little restraint/budgeting knowledge‚ÄîI thought I could take a portion and try to make some actual money with it. I‚Äôm willing to put at most $5k‚Ä¶because if I lose that, it would SUCK but I would be okay.

If you guys have any insight/tips, advice or‚Ä¶.any guidance at all, I would greatly appreciate it. I have‚Ä¶very little knowledge about the intricacies of trading and really just have had an impulse to invest a few times‚Ä¶.which if I HAD done, with the money I didn‚Äôt have to lose at the time, would have made bank‚Ä¶ like I could have bought Tesla when they first went public, but thought just because I like the company doesn‚Äôt mean anything and it was too confusing to try to learn.

So, anyway TL;DR : I‚Äô'm....definitely a novice lady,, but the few times I've found companies that I believed in, and thought would be profitable, I didn't act on that gut feeling. Also found it to be confusing to figure out HOW to buy and set up an online acct, etc. I  would GREATLY appreciate some tips and tricks/discussion. Please!

2021-05-20 23:03:31,stocks,"Alright I‚Äôm going to be aging myself here. 
I started around 2008 when interest rate dropped from 5% to near zero. So my high yield savings account makes nothing anymore. 

First trade was BS - BearsStern after JPM announced the take over at 10 per share. Second trade was LEH. If you don‚Äôt know history then you‚Äôll have to go find that ticket. 

I started tracking since 1/1/2009. Since then I averaged 8.18% a year. But the portfolio value as a whole about 30% a year. 

Up until 2014 I was an ‚Äúexpert stock picker‚Äù. By expert I mean I have nothing better to do that watch and read market news blogs etc. everyday I got my Schwab trading platform up on my second screen picking the next big stock. I was relatively flat and way underperforming a simple SPY(VOO). After 2014 I stopped looking and went 90% funds and ETFs. I had to because I started working for a real investment firm and I need to preclear all my stock trades. For my 10% stocks...I do semi annual rebalance to buy or sell. That has greatly helped the performance compared to when I was actively trading. 


Mistakes I learned: 
* don‚Äôt trust business news when they make recommendations. The experts that makes them don‚Äôt actually always believe it. Sometimes the show producer ask if they can make a case. 
* we always end up holding losers longer than we should and sell winners earlier than we should. - new rule 50% loss triggers an exit. Winners stay until the signals goes negative  
* figuring out how much to buy is just as hard - I started applying a risk control to the stocks.  I would split 10,000 to 4 sectors. Then buy them based on market cap. So large cap gets a higher weight within my 25,000 sector. 

How I am handling the recent drops? I sleep like a baby. I never experienced a drop larger than 4% on a given day. Even on the worst days....well that 4% is a 0.4% hit on my total portfolio. The rest of my assets are nicely allocated globally and across different asset classes."

2021-05-20 20:01:47,stocks,"20 years on Ford. Back when I was just starting out, I was thinking big. I bought into the local electric company and Ford, because I was sure that Electric Vehicles were going to be huge, and make me money. Welp. My Ford stock is still under water and I keep it as a reminder. Yes, there is such a thing as being too far ahead of the game. I've also learned to sell the cycles with 'cyclical stocks' such as automotive and oil. They go up 100%, then eventually go back down 50% (to the same price where you bought in) then they go back up. Holding long-term can get you absolutely nothing over the long term. And there is no reason you need to sell 100% of your shares in any company. Not a bad idea to keep some shares, maybe 5-25%. I sold out of AAPL, AMZN, PCLN etc. back when they were almost penny stocks. Sure, I sold out of some companies before they went bankrupt, but you can only lose 100% of your position. The maximum you can gain is technically infinity, but for the stocks mentioned, we'll say 10,000+%. And you can always write off your losses on your taxes, which means you lower your tax bill (or another way to look at it: too didn't truly lose 100% on that bankrupt company, because it allows you to write a smaller check to the government)"

Is this actually the case? Looking at the past decade (I know this doesn't predict future performance per say) but the large caps have grown considerably. AAPL for example doubled from 1T to 2T market cap in just two years which is wild. I know their growth has slowed since then but with them constantly killing earnings and continuously diversifying (M chips etc. ) is there any reason for them to slow or be outperformed by smaller companies this decade? I know they're considered a little overvalued, but that's the nature of large cap growth stocks in general.

Additionally, inflation tends to be less hard on large caps compared to smaller ones. Depending on how much inflation is coming over the next say 3-5 years, won't this also be another advantage for the largest cap companies?

I have no idea, just curious what everyone thinks on this thesis."

While they haven't necessarily topped out, aside from collecting the high dividend yield, I don't see a clear or significant upside anymore. This is also considering Mortgage REITS historically tend to trade within 1-2% of book value.

Quick edit so I don't have to repeat comment: Fords management decisions on EV are what have me excited.

2021-05-20 22:25:13,stocks,"They do have the EPS to support it, and if they can get out of the bottom of the S curve they should rocket.  
Standard disclaimer, I'm not a financial guy at all and I eat crayons or what not.  
My thesis:  
Roughly last decade or so, under Hackett, Ford executives realized a few things.  
1) Too many platforms = rollout is slow, design cycles too long.  
2) Too many loss making platforms = High ASP Customer moved from compact cars to SUVs.  
3) Other traditional automakers are ahead of them in EV transition. The Bolt, the Prius, the Mirai.  
So the strategy is this:  
1) Consolidate platforms : Faster factory retooling to adjust to market demands, better supply chain control  
2) Remove bad products  
3) Invest in Electrification.  
4) Keep market share in which they are already a leader in. That's Ford Transit (best selling commercial van) and F150. Both are among the first ford EVs (Outside of the mach-E, which they actually purchase the motors and etc, so it's closer to assembling a car, rather than designing it). The F150 lightning will have a motor that is designed in house, and probably cost less to build that to buy.  
More:   
All of these are not regular day to day decisions. These are all company shakeup level reorganization and rethinking from the top down. This is basically Ford 2.0, or whatever version they are on right now. To use a historical valuation on this new ford company is going to be a bit difficult. They are probably at  the 30% to 50% mark in the reinvention of their company so we might soon see them reap profits.  
Further out:  
When the E-transit hit the shelves, they will have more emission room to push their traditional line up in europe a little more. The Mustangs were selling a lot higher than it has to today because of the emissions. The mustang also has a huge cult following in the EU as it does in the U.S, it is not an easy feat as there are lots of amazing competition from across the pond.  
However,  
That said, the execution still needs to be improved. The Explorer launch in 2019 was poorly handled.  
The lack of new models hurt Ford sales in APAC, until the new mustang mach-e came in, they had many quarters of declining sales in China, which is the largest growing auto market and second largest auto market.   
There is risk associated with their justifiably huge debt in the ford credit arm (they take on loans to let their customers borrow against). Rising interest rate for example, could hurt their profitability in the long run.  
I hope they don't fumble with the F150 lightning, or it would be another long decade.   
TLDR: If I treat Ford as an entirely new company with no history of their successes or failings, I'd buy this stock at a lot higher price. There are risks to it, but at this current price point I'm cautiously optimistic"

If they do that, the entire industry will be up in arms(if you make your own chips in house, you won't be affected by the larger shortage which most major automakers are experiencing at the moment) nearly as much. Plus it's Apple, the way that companies and their leaders interact with the public has changed. Ford, VW and even Toyota haven't been able to capitalize on that change yet, and until then I wouldn't invest in any of those companies. I was in with Ford in 2018~ thinking the same thing, until I realized it was stagnating.  At least they pay dividends, TSLA has simply disrupted the entire industry while showing running a company can operate differently than the past, i don't see the younger generations going back to the traditional means at all in short term, perhaps in the long term they catch up to save their market share."
2021-05-21 11:46:11,stocks,"I've been pitching the idea of owning 100 shares to qualify for the X pricing plan. Nobody seems interested. For over ten years I've watched Ford with baffled amazement at it's lack of progress. You would have figured that as the only company not to receive a bailout, that  would resonate with investors. Nope. Then they've squandered years happy with the status quo of ICE vehicles and now only decided in the past few years to take EV's seriously. It's baffling. From production alone you would have figured this would have been a no brainer - fewer parts, lower cost and fewer fail points and a better product. Nope.  
This thing should be in the upper 20's to 40's range. Hopefully the Lightning will begin to push them there."

Ford needs to focus on what it does right: Mustangs, Rangers, and F150s (and basically nothing else!), all with V8 options and leave all this EV stupidity with Chevy so they can eat the losses on development.

The Fords I use at work are brand new, but very poorly designed with batteries under the driver's seat and computers that have to be dealer reset if your battery happens to die. Trim is falling off the inside and outside. The vehicles have under 20k miles on them.

All in all, there's just not a lot of pros for buying a Ford. I wouldn't spring for a Ford EV if they can't master what they already have.

Just my two cents, and I'm not here to beat them down. I just want to provide some perspective of consumer sentiment, as that's what drives profits."

With all the factories, existing supply chains, and existing middle management. How can Ford, and other legacy automakers, pivot in a manner that is cost effective. I would imagine so much of the legacy machinery and legacy management is a burden to the smooth transition of the business.

How much of existing systems and management is relevant to the EV push? Shedding the obsolete is going to be expensive. Not to mention the costs associated with new R&D, new manufacturing processes, new engineers.

These things are significant head winds for legacy automakers. New EV startups are not burdened with legacy baggage. I forsee that some of the legacy automakers will not be able to transition successfully and for those that do, they may not be as profitable or have the growth that one would think."

Problem with this is most utilities only charge low rates at specific times of the night so can‚Äôt just leave it in from dinner time or whatever. You can spend a ton of money wiring something else up but that cuts out everyone who is renting a home (forget owning this is an apartment complex.) 

For using the car on road trips the fast chargers are going to take forever because Ford relies on a horrible network.

It‚Äôs going to be a nightmare of a truck to live with you basically have to own a house and invest in a bunch of garage charging. The front trunk and the fact that it can power your house is badass, but the price is insanely low at $52k (meaning their f150 profit margin is totally gone) and it‚Äôs kind of going to be for no reason because it‚Äôs going to be super hard to use day to day unless you own a house."

Edit:  lower maintenance, no gas station stops (where everyone decides they need to use the restroom consecutively), no oil to change, etc.  I think the only downside is we‚Äôll probably see an increase in tires, I‚Äôve heard electric vehicles (with instantaneous torque) tend to go through drive tires more quickly."

When we're buying Ford stock , we're buying an automaker and a bank. And some folks look to the huge debt sheet as a negative because they borrow a lot on their credit to loan out to their customers. In a downturn that could hurt them.

Ford is showing signs of making positive changes toward growth and diversification which makes the future stock look promising.

2021-05-21 12:40:09,stocks,"This is the toughest part of trading for me and I think why I've stubbornly held onto F. 

There are a huge host of people in investing (and in these comments) who love to sound like the smartest guy in the room and they usually like to jump on a bandwagon until it becomes so overcrowded they feel special jumping off. That's how I've felt about Ford for years. Investors declared American manufacturing dead and so naturally Ford was dumped because they didn't move as much overseas. Then everyone had to double down when Ford stayed afloat by pointing out ""flaws"" that are no worse than most companies out there and it still struggled. The part that really killed is that Ford hasn't done a lot of diversifying or innovation that would make headlines so it became all the easier to dump. 

Which brings me to the bandwagon. I'm noticing an increase in investors naysaying sentiment stocks that are inflated on hype rather than numbers. TSLA has quickly become a target rather than the darling it once was and the more Musk makes a fool of himself or acts outrageous, the more investors like to poke at company issues (that have, ya know been there all along). Already I'm seeing a few analysts and investors drooling at the prospect of Ford hitting Tesla in the profits as a decent competitor. If they can rally that sort of hipster support and if Ford can keep making the news it'll help propel the stock to decent levels"

2021-05-20 20:56:01,stocks,"Ha. You aren't wrong re: styling. And yet GM has had poor styling for many years and continues to have a loyal fan base, especially on the truck side. So I don't personally disagree on the vehicle appeal at all... but somehow GM remains the volume leader among US automakers. So the proof is in the data that at least their customers like what they are making.

From a management bench, GM has a strong leadership team, led by Mary Barra who's been in that chair for 7 years and is doing a great job. They had a smart CFO that was snapped up by Stripe. BTW I personally believe pre-bailout GM was not a well run company, but the leadership brought in during the auto-bailout fundamentally changed GM for the better.

They made smart investments (Cruise), exited struggling brands (Pontiac, Saturn), exited markets that weren't working well (Europe), and entered new growth markets (China). Today's GM isn't the old one.

Ford on the other hand still has heavy family influence in who leads and the direction of the company (Bill Ford is Exec Chairman). Frankly that influence isn't great from an outcomes standpoint. They terminated several CEOs who were very effective (Nasser, Fields). They hired (IMHO) a totally unqualified person to be CEO (Hackett). Now they have yet another CEO who has only been in the chair for 6 months. Yes they have big plans now - but the last guy also had big plans. To me the execution - outside of Alan Mullaly- has not been great. They invested in Chariot, and shut it down - but what were the learnings and next moves? There are other data points.

Then look at the stock returns for GM and Ford. On a 5 year return, Ford is -5%. GM is +82%. The market story says it all. Confidence in what GM is doing and lack thereof for Ford. I dumped my Ford shares shortly after Hackett took over and I don't regret it for a second.

The Mach-E probably took some Mustang buyers away, but studies show that it‚Äôs a direct competitor to Tesla‚Äôs ModelX and has done very well chipping away at that market segment.  Ford is using the same formula with this F-150.  

The fact that Ford was first to market with a BEV pickup (startups like Rivian haven‚Äôt produced any yet), using the already popular F-150 model, and offering it at a value below its internal combustion engine counterpart is a good recipe for success.  We won‚Äôt know until units start shipping, but I‚Äôm hopeful for Ford‚Äôs future.  The Mach-E and Lightning are really good stop-gaps until Ford can put together a battery sled chassis."

""What we know so far is that the base Lightning, which is intended for **commercial customers**, will likely cost around $42,000 including a mandatory destination charge""

It isn't a confirmed thing, and the speculation on some of the threads on r/ford was that it is intended to be fleet. But if it were available to us, it'd be great!"

2021-05-21 09:24:08,stocks,2021 is a new model year with a new frame and body.  It‚Äôs a different technology platform and therefore has different needs.  A profitable automaker that actually refreshes its models is going to plan shit out and wait for the economics to be right.

If the handle that has a ultrasinic sensor that with revolutionary tech built to see through sheet metal so they didn't have to have a blemish in the door and weak spot for rust malfunctions... I'll fix it or buy a replacement. The car was a huge leap in progress and I will support them. As they progress to towards fixing the bugs. They also don't push out a new model every year to stay relevant they improve the same model year after year. It was built beyond relevant. In the US I might add. If Henry F was alive today. Ford would probably be just as amazing but he's been dead along time. After all he and Edison did make a few E cars. Lol it's also electric and the drive train is proven to keep trucking past 300k I can deal with anything else.

They have a hydrogen car and truck, a half assed RAV4 plug in hybrid, and their Prius lines which are great. There is a Corolla hybrid somewhere too. After that, I'm not super aware of much they have done. 

I'm just surprised since toyota usually is a market leader in new tech."
2021-05-21 13:51:23,stocks,They shouldn‚Äôt wait. They run the risk of losing customers. I would guess there are some Tundra drivers who will be tried of waiting for a Toyota EV truck and buy the F150. Same thing with Highlander drivers. Maybe they‚Äôll decide they want an EV and buy the Mach E or even the Kia EV6...who knows.
2021-05-21 09:31:14,stocks,"It would be a good idea if it would work. The Prius doesn't have enough HP/torque to make it being a in a truck worthwhile. This truck would end up being as silly as. The syclon with (500lbs tow capacity) a horrendous tow capacity and shallow eight limit. The Prius drive train is fwd, low impact, and maintenance. It wouldn't work well in a truck. If Toyota could invest more in hydrogen we would see their hydrogen truck a lot more rather than just in hydrogen only areas (Socal and a few other places world wide.)

Edit: if small businesses come together to purchase fleet vehicles they can qualify for them but also for the fleet vehicle discount. I believe ford needs a minimum of 10 units to be considered ""fleet"" and qualify for the feet stuff. Don't quote me on it but that's what I last heard."

2021-05-20 21:52:07,stocks,"Ford just had the most profitable quarter in their history. They are reducing debt by closing operations in unprofitable areas of the world (See Brazil).  They have the best-selling vehicle in the America (F150) and the best-selling commercial vehicle (Transit). Both are being electrified and will be extremely popular. The F150 Lightning is spectacular. They also have their ICE cars, of course, which gives them a much larger target market than Tesla (which has never turned a profit without carbon credits). The Mustang Mach-E has gotten rave reviews across the board. 

Ford has the resources and brand recognition to overtake Tesla in five years or less. Tesla‚Äôs bulls talk about the appeal to Millennials...who are the poorest generation.  They also underestimate how many people will gravitate towards a trusted legacy brand for their first EV, rather than the Teslas that crash into trees.

Thank you for explaining what ‚Äúoutperform‚Äù means to me. I said I would have plenty left over because it‚Äôs not fair to put just shy of $1.3m against whatever you have in your Robinhood account."

2021-05-21 01:08:42,stocks,"Dividends must have just recently been reinstated then, I had some Ford stock earlier this year and did some DD and looked on their website at the investor info section and read the board meeting notes. Read there that they had suspended them for the last couple years, starting before COVID. Must have been a recent change."
2021-05-21 10:09:59,stocks,"I disagree strongly.  Vast majority of work trucks I see here in Seattle aren't carrying that much weight. For example, a glazier that is a client was looking into buying six gray market small trucks found they carry two workers, about 200# of tools, plus whatever glass they're carrying.  A Prius drive train will easily handle that. It's not like most small trucks are typically carrying a huge load of wood to build a house or pulling a trailer with a backhoe.  If you are, then you buy a F-250.

As far as FWD goes, unless you're carrying quite a bit of cargo, trucks often have trouble with traction.  Here in Seattle with steep  hills, slick concrete, and rain, pickups can be a lot of trouble to drive.  I don't drive a truck often, but I once got stuck on Spring St right in the middle of downtown.  I had to turn around and go the wrong way on a one-way street since I couldn't keep the back wheels from spinning to go up the hill."
2021-05-21 01:52:32,stocks,Unsustainable is just part of it. The other part is that carbon emissions are heating up the planet. It's not just about the cost of oil.
2021-05-20 21:35:52,stocks,What car is sized for 500 miles?
2021-05-20 22:00:27,stocks,"> As an example, my parents live 300 km round trip from me, and in the winter temperatures where they live frequently drop below -20 deg C, at that temperature range is about 50% of nominal. That means there is a unacceptably high chance that current EV ranges would not be enough to make a round trip to my parents house in winter, something I do frequently so my daughter can visit them. Just about every survey and market analyst report I've read lists range as a top barrier/concern for consumers considering EVs, even now with 200-250 mile range EVs. It's a valid point.

I don't think **most people** will need to drive 186 miles in one day in subzero temperatures with parents who don't let their child charge their car at their house very often. 

Not literally every single person needs to buy an EV right away for them to be a success."
2021-05-21 02:41:45,stocks,"The problem is what if the charge station is used? For gasoline cars, no problem - just wait 5 minutes. For EV it is going to take a lot more infrastructure to support that."

Paying for and carrying around 400 miles worth of extra battery all the time is just inefficient and pointless."
2021-05-21 00:55:55,stocks,"Yes, that's my point. Luxury vehicles should be higher margin, and Tesla makes luxury vehicles, it is easier to make money on them compared with the much larger mid to low end market. Luxury market is smaller. If tesla struggles to turn a profit on luxury vehicles, they are not likely to grow into the much larger mid/low end of the market any time soon where margins are tighter. Toyota, Volkswagen, Honda etc know how to make money on low margin cars."

EV optimal spots:

Mind you this is a legit OEM so they have been designing and virtually building the thing for two, probably three years.  Since it‚Äôs a new frame probably longer than that.  Your posts somewhat boil down to the ridiculous TSLA bull hypocrisy that EVs are superior because they‚Äôre so much simpler but at the same time traditional OEMs (With their experience in more complicated products) have no conceivable chance of catching up.

2021-05-21 11:55:25,stocks,"So the Prius drive train is low horsepower/torque for mpg sake. The Prius has the 1.8l gas engine paired with an electric battery powered hybrid system. It makes 121hp at 5200 rpm. It has 105ft-lbs of torque. Most common drive trian is FWD and second is their awd system which is not full time. It comes standard with a Continuously Variable Transmission and is the only option. 

Based on the specs above, the drive train would work in a small truck but it would have little to no tow capacity. The Prius by itself can pull 3500lbs maximum, this includes people and gear in the car. I'm not saying it wouldn't work but it would such a niche market, why not just put this tech into a toyota tacoma with increase batteries and towing capacity. Tacoma tows up to 6800 with a payload of 1058lbs

As for fwd/rwd/awd/4x4, if you're in Seattle with slippy weather tires play a huge factor. A truck running on summer tires versus wet/rain or winter tires is going to have a huge factor on grip. Hell even all seasons and all weather's are different. I figure, most work trucks you see are running in the cheaper All Weather tires which perform much worse in wet conditions. All weather tires perform well when it's warm and wet versus cold and wet. The tire compound hardens up below 55 degrees normally (some garden below 60 degrees). 

What truck were you driving when you got stuck? Do you know what tires the truck had?

I do see some strength in Tesla but it‚Äôs due to their other business arms, not automotive.  Keep in mind that their profit beat last quarter was driven by Bitcoin valuations.  I don‚Äôt believe many people will embrace autonomy for many years to come.  Once technology is available, the developing company loses advantage in less than a year usually.  If Tesla chooses to spin off starlink/solar stuff, the automotive part will be hurting.

I think you‚Äôre missing It‚Äôs a body on frame pickup, likely least space efficient platform there is. It‚Äôs not a Bolt. It‚Äôs still meant to do truck things and appeal to a traditional truck buyer so there‚Äôs no real benefit to some aero focused design when most people spending $60k+ are going to do what they do with a comparable ICE F150 today‚Ä¶ short trips and highway cruising with occasional bed use or hauling a few times a year. The F150 sells more than 750k examples a year. I still don‚Äôt believe they have the capacity to supply this but at a 5% conversion rate they‚Äôd beat Tesla‚Äôs total sales. I continue to be confused as to how you see that as nearly DOA or how this has been done before. I think the opposite, GM should've done this first with the Silverado and Sierra twins and taken the hit with the battery tech instead of trying to instantly get it back by launching a $110k super truck that will only sell a few thousand examples a year. My guess is they couldn't get their hands on enough batteries and chose to use their supply on the highest return option.

Nope I do not. There's a reason why your idea doesn't exist. 121hp that has a maximum tow/pay of 3500 is measly compared to the rest of the truck world. It would be better to out the hybrid system into a Tacoma.

How to interpret these numbers:

If you were to sell a covered call on SPY 6.07% above the weeks opening price, you should expect to see your shares taken away once every 100 weeks. Past performance is not indicative of future performance, but these numbers have been compiled from inception to now, and include about 1000-1500 weeks of data."
2021-05-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Put option break even? Sorry for the newb question but have been searching and i can't find the answer...
So.. say i own 2 puts of XYZ@165 strike and i paid $4 a share.

so. am i seeing something wrong? if i paid 800 and i get 800 back barely in the money why does everyone say it's the price of the stock+premium to calculate break even?

 I'm sure it's just me missing something.. trying to learn before i screw myself.

P.S. the ticker and numbers above are just for example..

2021-05-21 08:15:34,stocks,Before expiry the option can trade above it‚Äôs intrinsic value (=how much is the option in the money). The difference is called the time value which decays to 0 on expiry. So you can break even above/below the break even price by selling before expiry.

If you want to invest in real estate long term (which is wise), you need to look at REITs and what type of property they rent. I recommend against going into residential because there will likely be some pull back once the rental moratorium ends. I also recommend against mortgage REITs because they are in a ugly place right now. 

I am bullish on healthcare reits and senior living though you need to be careful about the management. Lots of scum in the stock market and REITs are no different. Id stick to the tried and true big dogs with long histories of performance like Ventas, Welltower or National Health Investors. There are other good ones, just saying to do your DD.

Commercial real estate is in a bad place right now due to the shift to online shopping. That doesnt mean thay are all bad so again, if you do your own research, there are some good ones out there. O has been mentioned a few times already.

2021-05-20 21:08:48,stocks,"The whole lithium sector was hyped to death due to unrealistic expectations regarding the time frame of the EV transition. I expect it to weaken before starting on a slope up for the longer term. Though it will get some support from inflation fears for the time being.

A good signal for when the current craze might be over is TSLA returning to a sane valuation, which will probably take a few more months; that will probably lead to loss of interest in the sector from inexperienced retail investors (which usually is a good buy signal).

The global demand for lithium will grow slower than expected, because the EV transition will take the better part of this decade rather than happen overnight. Later on we might get SS batteries, which should temper the demand for lithium.

One thing to keep in mind is that lithium is not a ""rare"" mineral, so it does not have the supply constraints of rare earth elements (which are in fact ""rare"" in terms of profitable mine prospects), nor does it have the geopolitical importance of the latter (which relates to China's near monopoly on REEs extraction and high performance magnets).

2021-05-21 10:22:33,stocks,"Oh really, it isn't? Selling a stock for a loss then buying it back? Those are the literal mechanics of a wash sale/short ladder if you just repeat the action.

IRS has a ruling against it because of tax deductions because it was very profitable for shorters to tank the price in this manner and declare a loss."

2021-05-21 01:04:03,stocks,"For retail it arguably makes no sense. For billion dollar hedge funds it's a different story. Short selling creates a selling pressure which can lower the stock price, which works in their favor. That can also trigger panic selling from other investors and traders which drops it even further."

2021-05-21 02:17:32,stocks,"Example 1: You buy puts $20 out of the money. The stock drops $15 then your options expire worthless. You were right about the stock dropping, but lost $$.

&#x200B;

Example 2: You buy puts figuring he stock would drop soon. The stock doesn't move and the options expire worthless, then the following week the stock tanks. You were right (about the stock tanking) but your timing was a little off, so you ended up losing money because you didn't buy far enough out.

&#x200B;

Example 3: You buy puts and the stock tanks. You have made 50%, double, maybe triple or more on your money. But, you are convinced that there is more downside to come, so you hold. The stock goes back up, then the options expire. You should have sold when you had profits. You were right, but still lost money in the end."
2021-05-21 05:55:10,stocks,"selling puts is equivalent to long, you want to sell calls if you think stock will fall as op thinks a particular stock will fall."

They're literally just selling tickets for sub-orbital joyrides (with the potential for suborbital point to point travel). 

It's not at all unlikely that they could be profitable within that niche. They've already sold plenty of preorder tickets (not to say that guarantees anything, but it does show that plenty of people have interest in what they're offering)."

But as of right now, I think most rich people are going to stick to helicopter tours and private jets rather then shelling out 250,000 to take a selfie with planet earth in the background. Sure, a handful of billionaires might send their kids to go once. Maybe some celebrities and athletes will go  for the clout. Let's give a generous estimate of 100 people every year deciding to go on a suborbital ride past the stratosphere that costs as much as a small house. That's 250,000,000 in revenue. Probably not even enough to maintain their fleet of spaceships which will sustain heavy damage every time they pierce the atmosphere."

2021-05-21 14:48:56,stocks,"Every brand new technology will go through an initial period of high prices, as well as the standard supply and demand price-curve. Regular air travel was the same to a lesser extent when that was a new technology. As they fine tune the technology and process, those $250k tickets will become $125k tickets and $60k tickets and so forth.

I think you're being pretty unreasonable about the demand too. You don't think there are thousands if not millions of millionaires/billionaires to whom $250k (and less) are a drop in the bucket? Those same people go on cruises, helicopter tours, luxurious vacations, and all manner of paid-for experiences. Keep in mind we're talking about something pretty much every person has day dreamed of since being a little kid, seeing the earth from [what feels like] outer space, and being weightless in 0g. 

Not to mention they've sold more than 600 preorder tickets *without even currently having a viable product*. You think once they're consistently launching flights into orbit they're suddenly going to cap out at 100 tickets a year?"

2021-05-20 22:55:19,stocks,"No, since you are planning for a very long retirement you should not be planning the same as someone who is retiring at 70. Because of the longer timeline, you run a much higher risk of running out of money if you pursue  lower return vehicles such as bonds.

I would recommend you invest in 70% US total market index fund and 30% International ex US index fund and keep it that way through your retirement. Your portfolio will have much higher volatility than a typical 30-year retirement portfolio, and you may have to adjust your spending based on year-to-year returns, but you run a much lower risk of running out of funds long term with this strategy."
2021-05-21 00:41:49,stocks,"There are so many questions like how much of that 250k will you be able to save, and how much do you need a year?

I think it is fair to say you can easily get over 2m by 45, probably quite a lot more. You can easily get a 50k return annually (assuming 2.5%) with 2m in safe assets. Assuming if inflation is relatively normal, then you can also do some math and start taking out from your principal. For instance, if you take 20k from your principal a year, how will that affect everything. This is assuming you can live on 50-70k a year.

If you ever hit hyper inflation though, you are screwed."

2021-05-21 03:58:39,stocks,"I dont think the risk in Chinese companies is going away any time soon - the government is unlikely to give up any of its power over those companies and could even over-exert control at times just to show they can.  How the market values that risk could fluctuate depending on whatever the current level of tension exists between China and other countries, though.  

In the US, being 'tough on China' has become something that both political parties are trying to show, so I dont see that relationship easing much in the next 10 years, but it could get incrementally better over time which could boost those valuations slightly.

Companies like Alibaba and JD look undervalued compared to the US mega caps because of those risks, but risk is a major part of determining value.  There are a lot of circumstances where I could see the value of Chinese companies dropping 75% or more overnight, and that's not the case with the US megas.  Just because they trade at a lower PE ratio doesnt automatically make them undervalued."
2021-05-21 02:50:34,stocks,I‚Äôve thought this and so do many. The China risk is real. When does it go away ?
2021-05-21 03:32:53,stocks,Alibaba basically provides all the crap on Amazon.  It's way undervalued IMO.
2021-05-21 03:53:13,stocks,Both are really undervalued. I‚Äôve got large positions in both but the China risk is real and should be considered before investing in them.
2021-05-20 23:18:43,stocks,Keeps rising? it‚Äôs down 18% in the last three months. It‚Äôs great value and a long term hold for me. I think you get in now. It‚Äôs at a discount right now.
2021-05-21 00:34:25,stocks,It‚Äôs crossing over a year on the individual shares you sell. You have to pick if you‚Äôre selling the new ones or the older ones
2021-05-21 00:37:15,stocks,"Actual diversification is a guaranteed return in the long run. However, the same cannot be said about putting the same amount of money into 1 stock. The variation is a lot higher if you only have 1 stock, but you don't want to be on the short end of the stick.

I think apple is a great company too. At the end of the day, I do not have all my money in apple because who knows what happens 30 years down the line. Probably still around and doing great, but you never know."

2021-05-21 09:40:50,stocks,"Gonna be blunt here but, are you thick or something?

THE. AMOUNT. IS. IRRELEVANT.

If Bill Gates goes out and blows 100 million dollars on a single put and loses it all in the space of a week, does that make it not high risk because it's chump change for him? It doesn't matter if it's 1 dollar or Citadel's entire warchest, the risk factor is completely independent from the initial amount of capital, the potential for losses is what makes the risk. Do you understand the difference or do I need to bust out the crayons?"
2021-05-21 09:53:33,stocks,"the amount is the only thing that matters.

He is risking $100. the max loss is $100.

Anyone can do this at anytime without breaking a sweat.

Why would anyone be interested in OP's progress when literally everyone here has the $100 to do the same thing."
2021-05-21 10:01:22,stocks,"That answers my question then...

>He is risking $100. the max loss is $100.

So the max loss is 100% of the initial capital, which you consider low risk? At what point do you think it's high risk? 150%? 200%? Your risk management strategy must be fucking hilarious ""Entry: When my FOMO kicks in SL: YOLO iM nOt A bItCh"""
2021-05-21 10:02:02,stocks,"Yes and he is only risking $100.

That is incorrect.

Did you make this claim?

2021-05-21 10:31:56,stocks,"WTF are you even talking about? That's common knowledge. Every autonomy company using LIDAR uses it.

* Waymo: https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona
* Cruise: https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/06/gm-cruise-origin-designed-to-handle-snow-will-be-geo-fenced/
* Argo AI: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/volkswagen-plans-self-driving-electric-microbus-with-argo-ai-by-2025.html

You can keep dodging the question, but you simply have no example of LIDAR autonomy without geofencing because it doesn't exist. It's not possible with that technology. LIDAR relies on prescanning the environment. That's the whole idea behind the technology, but you don't know that because you've never done any research and are just talking out of your arse.

Unless you're gonna show me a source that proves there is someone using LIDAR without geofencing, I'm done talking to you now. You're not trying to learn or share information, you're just talking bs and waste everyone's time including your own."
2021-05-21 11:10:33,stocks,"You didn't understand any of that.

They use geofencing to avoid making errors in conditions they haven't trained the AI for. While driving, the GPS, visual, and LIDAR inputs are used for real-time control. The lack of afferent LIDAR information is a hole in Tesla's system that causes it to drive into walls and under large truck trailers that the imaging system doesn't resolve as solid objects.

Geofencing isn't a requirement to use LIDAR, but those who are smart enough to use LIDAR to improve afferent data are also smart enough to use geofencing to avoid untrained conditions.

You can keep lying, you can admit you're ignorant, or you can shut up."

AR will dominate when it has sexy glasses that don't make you look like a dork, but they still have some amazing next level functionality. The amazing next-level functionality will be here really soon (like 2 or 3 years), but the sexy glasses that don't make you look like a dork could be 15 years away. 

For example, look at the Snap prototype. It still looks dorky as can be and the battery only lasts a half hour, lol. That's the other big challenge for AR. AR's use case is basically that you'd be wearing them all day. You'd charge them while you're sleeping and you wear them most of the day (the theory being that they'd be so compelling that you'd be willing to do that).

Plenty of fish in the sea.   One of my bankers has really done a great job but is conservative and for most of that, its a good play and position.  However, these sayings:  ""You can not time the market"".  ""You need to balance your portfolio"".  You buy all of the time and ""dollar cost Average"".  That's all rubbish in my opinion.  I believe that you must time the market and be intelligent in your decisions.  Take emotion out of it.  Balancing a portfolio of stocks means that you water down good investments and balancing means that you want average returns.  If you want average, buy market index funds and forget about it like QQQ's.  Dollar cost averaging means you are too lazy and are being a sheep.

You often want to buy when others are selling.  You want to sell when everyone is recommending the stock(s).  Example is MRVL.  They were crushed 5 years back and market CAP and cash on hand was almost the same amount.  Cramer and the ""pros"" hated it.   Stock was $6.50/$7 range.  All was negative.  I saw that the cash on hand was worth almost same as stock on market (the float).  Also tons of IP that was on top of cash on hand.  Everyone said stay away.  I bought over time from $6.50 untill $11 i bought no more, but i had about $300k in then.  Today it was $45/$46.  I still have it.  I have $1.3 Mil roughly.
