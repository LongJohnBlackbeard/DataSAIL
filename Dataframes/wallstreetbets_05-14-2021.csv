2021-05-14 19:22:15,wallstreetbets,"I'm shocked. Useful DD on this sub? What are you doing?

Seriously, kudos for an objective look at a company that you have some bias towards because you use their services.

I think it's too early to invest until there's more information to go on.

I wonder if it will be an acquisition by one of the big guys down the road if it grows its user base and proves itself over a few years."

2021-05-14 18:55:02,wallstreetbets,Great DD. cant wait to see how it plays out.
2021-05-14 19:00:17,wallstreetbets,"long roblox here.  I bought in for a stupid reason - on twitch, a guy I follow streams it and people just flock to this guys channel to play roblox with him.  People LOVE it, and although the guy is nice, he is a bit boring.  I‚Äôm convinced his growth is because kids are obsessed w the game.  Was enough for me!"
2021-05-14 19:11:42,wallstreetbets,"My account was banned from a game for a made-up reason. The only way to dispute is through recording my sessions, because who doesn't record every play-session they have, right?  Anyway, proof of innocence falls on me, no support from Roblox.

No way I'm spending any money In-platform or investing into it. Total garbage. Downvote if you like, but from user-end I absolutely hate Roblox.

&#x200B;

Edit: Kids are obsessed with it? Sure. Wait until they get banned from their favorite games willy-nilly. That would really help Roblox long-term."
2021-05-14 19:01:08,wallstreetbets,"The thing about this particular pick is that, as a business model, it does have incredible upside. I do agree in that its current price is overvalued but if Roblox can show that this model is a winning one, then their books will grow to match their market valuation."
2021-05-14 19:36:08,wallstreetbets,"It's literally been trading sideways, how'd you make money off puts? 'Grats on timing the top each time if that's the case"
2021-05-14 19:32:17,wallstreetbets,"I definitely should've covered how marketwide phenomena would affect Roblox's share price, but oh well. I do agree, we're in a transitional period of the market for different industries to outperform the wider market."
2021-05-14 19:28:54,wallstreetbets,"Can't say I'm very experienced with this either, so it's good that I was born with a wrinkle or too. I don't play Roblox actively anymore but the bias is still there nonetheless, I spent most of my early gaming years playing it. The upside for investing early can be definitely much higher but if Roblox can't sustain this growth then the trade can also go bad with an early entry.  


If it gets acquired by Apple I'm blowing my brains out on the spot. Doubt they would, I'd bet money Microsoft or something would nab it."
2021-05-14 19:04:18,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-05-14 19:19:35,wallstreetbets,"If you were banned from an individual game, I can't really see how Roblox can mediate that dispute, especially with the sheer amount of games that exist on the platform. However, I do understand the sentiment. There's definitely room for improvement for user end stuff, and I do think their user support is a little behind, and their report system is... bad, to say the least, from my memory. I remember one of my accounts got warned for, and I quote, ""being teh KKK"".

This still doesn't change the fact the company has a model that has good, if not great, upside potential."

2021-05-14 19:55:06,wallstreetbets,I bought calls expiring next year just in case. This will mark the 16th stock that I've lost money on listening to advice on reddit. Where do I keep getting the money to lose? The occasional reddit thread that causes a stock to shoot the moon for no reason. 1 win for every 5 losses roughly has put me a break even point so far.

2021-05-14 19:53:53,wallstreetbets,"Good luck to you guys but this is kind of bullshit, it's sad we feel a need to resort to praying for some manipulative short squeeze to happen to boost the stock. Long term, this stock is likely to succeed or fail on the merits of the company's engineering, design, and business acumen (with a little help from the Biden admin EV push), not from temporary market shenanigans. As a long GOEV investor, I want to see them do it the right way by building a sustainable business."
2021-05-14 19:19:37,wallstreetbets,I like the skateboard platform it's unique and original. GOEV has an earnings call and potential news on Monday 05/17/21 at market close - Check it out - Then make a decision - Monday may be a game changer...

Think about all the stuff that has been bleeding - Fsly, Roku, Pton, Zm, SQ, Twtr, Clne, TTD (down 30% on a 10 for 1 stock split). Those are more interesting that is why they have hit bottom and started to recover.

My guess is the macro of this is some sectors like retail are at ath -WSM, RH, KSS GPS etc.  When big money can't see big gains there any more they will turn their money somewhere else.

2021-05-14 17:49:28,wallstreetbets,"All this talk about SPY and **y'all forget**:

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? 

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. 

Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again."

2021-05-14 17:15:37,wallstreetbets,"Over the past year the market has pulled back three times in the 7% to 8% range only to overcome those losses and set new record highs again and again. This week saw such a pullback in the range of about 5% with the market gaining back about half of those losses in the later part of the week. We are beginning to see emerging economic data that is pointing to areas of concern - especially inflation. Inflation comes in two forms; the first is commodity inflation, most notably oil prices and ultimately gasoline. The second form is wage inflation, which is what is happening now. For example, this week McDonalds raised its minimum starting pay from $11/hour to $17/hour - not a minor increase. This big increase is because McDonalds is competing with a $900/week government check to its potential employees. Hence, wage inflation has a new and much high floor. If this trend of wage inflation continues expect the Federal Reserve to move interest rates higher. The market will not like that. Good luck to all"

The strike price was so high, Disney barely broke $200 in the past year.

I also personally hate Mickey Mouse due to getting injured at Disney theme park due to their negligence that broke 4 back ribs and put one through my lung.  Mickey fought me when all I wanted was my hospital bills paid.  I was in icu for a week.  Fuck Mickey Mouse.

I agree with the handicapped placard."

All its missing is volume/ strong buying pressure. 

Also, there were 2 large scale orders this week totaling almost 1.75mm between the 2 orders and I suspect that was Matt already starting the buyback.

If he shows his big green hulk dick even a couple times next week and added pressure from retail, that might be enough."
2021-05-14 17:23:15,wallstreetbets,"Just to reiterate here...  


\-$300M buybacks authorized. They have likely started buying as of this week. Share price hit all time low's.

\-Low amount of float available and getting even lower as they buyback shares

\-Low daily volume

\-High borrow rate + highly shorted -- they can't short forever if the share price starts moving up

\-Significant number of calls and OI vs. available float

\-Decent dividend rate to entice institutional and boomers to hold

\-Insider buying recently at $7.97/share for $470k-ish

600 shares @ $7.66 & 10 $7 calls 6/18"

2021-05-14 16:47:14,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think the missed calls are conspiracy theories.  I just think a squeeze is far more challenging to pull off than the predictions and most predictors understand.

Good luck - I hope you are right!!!"
2021-05-14 17:08:44,wallstreetbets,"I have done research and sure, it is possible.  My point is there are for more posts with reasonable evidence of a squeeze and high conviction that results in no squeeze at all. 

My suspicion is funds are getting much better at looking at short squeezes driven by retail.  Its not like they can‚Äôt read Wallstreetbets.  They also have better data on the real numbers for a squeeze than we get."
2021-05-14 18:09:42,wallstreetbets,Yep...it's because there is virtually no extrinsic value left in them due to theta decay and no instinsic value due to being OTM.
2021-05-14 16:38:25,wallstreetbets,"Again, not a chance"
2021-05-14 18:57:32,wallstreetbets,Proof or ban!
2021-05-14 18:42:33,wallstreetbets,No clue man but if the data is correct it does seem like a formula for a squeeze. As long as it goes into double digits I'm making decent money. I would say at least ATH and break through from there? Might not be instant could take some time.
2021-05-14 16:55:26,wallstreetbets,"I do agree that ""short squeeze"" is too often thrown about.

I am in UWMC for the value play long-term and saw the price to borrow over tripled in a single day; that had a short squeeze written all over it.

If there are only a few shares to borrow at exorbitant prices, it takes away a tool to push the price down (or at least makes it prohibitively expensive). I see that as a GREAT thing for my long position.

If WSB comes in and scares away the shorts, that's only a short-term bonus for me.

TBH, it is a runaway effect on short covers. Its not like one guy or group doing the shorting, its multiple funds and all in it for profit.

When stock price goes up, borrow costs go up, or there is no more available to short to play with the stock price; one of the funds will cover (profitably).

The other funds either think they can keep pushing it down or they know the cost to borrow will go down (because one fund is no longer borrowing them so they are available) so they stay.

A ""short squeeze"" as we on WBS know it is when all the funds are racing to get out at the same time. If they stagger getting out, we wont even notice the upward price pressure. Or if another fund sees the opportunity and dives in, wont notice.

It is when all the shorts are equally afraid and want to be the first to get out that triggers what WE call a short squeeze. Or something happens to make them afraid (like cost to borrow tripling in hours). 

The reality is that shorts cover EVERY SINGLE DAY it's just most times we don't notice because they do so strategically and in an orderly fashion.

The short squeezes we NOTICE are because those Hedge funds want to fuck each other JUST as bad as they want to fuck us and are racing to see who can get out faster :)"
2021-05-14 17:53:44,wallstreetbets,There are also funds that will want to ride retail momentum to screw over other funds
2021-05-14 16:39:32,wallstreetbets,Best of luck with your bags!
2021-05-14 17:59:06,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely.  

Its easy to end a short position at a loss small loss though.  The huge Melvin error on GME is avoidable once believed to be a danger.  The shorts have gotten away unscathed so often they screwed that one up.

Since the early squeezes it has become this mantra that has largely been lost dollars. 

Amc is making people money because of true value in recovery.  Same with silver in inflation.  

Rocket after the one squeeze, and I should have included the original, left bag holders of many, many in retail."

Most other smart money institutions up their share count while suggesting lower price targets; like Citi who puts it at $17, but bought in likely at $23-24. Or countless others. I think Blackrock is the only other big player recently to decrease holdings in a sizable amount. Everyone else is buying."
2021-05-14 19:27:10,wallstreetbets,"Initially because they DPO‚Äôd instead of IPO, so the institutions didn‚Äôt hype it to make themselves profit.

2021-05-14 19:21:19,wallstreetbets,"i didn't check any numbers but since pltr is still a growth company they most likely do not have much debt so cost of equity impacts WACC and the discount rate a lot.

2021-05-14 15:07:28,wallstreetbets,Looks like I timed it perfectly and sold at the bottom as well.
2021-05-14 15:07:51,wallstreetbets,Early February.
2021-05-14 15:11:16,wallstreetbets,Yes I agree.

Even with it so far out? Isn‚Äôt it better to just either watch it get worse or break even at least. 

Is their a more rational (sry) explanation, than I hate red...110% not trying to start shit or anything. 
Just curious wanting to pick your brain a little bit."
2021-05-14 14:03:25,wallstreetbets,Crab... how much did you lose?

2021-05-14 18:44:38,wallstreetbets,This is the first time I've ever been actually angry at someone for a trade that has nothing to do with me. I hate you.

joking aside, saw you grew $25k + 40k into a hefty fortune, congrats! You‚Äôre fine and can FD another day. I‚Äôm similar but only up a few mil, started with HELOC funds (now fully paid back)"

2021-05-14 14:42:20,wallstreetbets,Thanks that means a lot
2021-05-14 17:38:34,wallstreetbets,Problem is options can go to 0 shares typically cannot.  So usually if an options contract hits -50% I bail because I‚Äôd rather have some money than no money.  I think Dis is a strong reopening play but I don‚Äôt know when they will rally so I‚Äôll keep the shares for now.  Once I see some momentum or once COVID finally seems over I‚Äôll probably get in on 23 LEAPS.
2021-05-14 14:41:50,wallstreetbets,Over 1 million between two accounts
2021-05-14 18:31:46,wallstreetbets,You know......... what you are.....  you know..
2021-05-14 17:47:30,wallstreetbets,Yup could be the wrong desicion but Dis+ has a ways to go and COVID is still a thing in the world

2021-05-14 17:14:38,wallstreetbets,An account that suddenly became active and started posting in trading centered subs in the last 30 days making posts in the other subreddit directly linking their post on WSB (which they had posted over 10 times in a single week) for awards and upvotes.

2021-05-14 13:19:20,wallstreetbets,"The big issue here is regulatory.

The other offer from Canadian Pacific is around $275 per share and they have mentioned that they aren't going to raise it further after rival offer from Canadian National at $325.

Since this is about railroads, regulatory approval is the key issue here more than anything as US doesn't need further consolidation leading to monopolies.

Surface transport Board(STB) who is responsible for regulatory approval, has in principle, agreed that merger of KSU with CP is ok, as it will still be the smallest class one railway even after merger.

The decision for KSU with CN is still pending and is more difficult to get approval 

Only if that approval goes through, KSU can be bought by CN at $325, else they have to accept CP's only offer at $275

So this isn't a straight forward arbitrage opportunity, the stock can even tank to $275, depending of STB's decision"

2021-05-14 14:06:16,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for doing more research than I did. That's a solid point on the regulatory front (my opinion was just an opinion about regulatory). I believe CP has 5 days to respond to make a counter offer. If they don't up the offer, maybe that shows they think a regulatory decision will go their way. If they try to match or beat the bid, then game on. Maybe best to wait until mid-week to see what move CP makes"
2021-05-14 13:14:10,wallstreetbets,Good bot
2021-05-14 14:28:23,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I too will prefer waiting for mid-next week. KSU seems to have accepted the CN offer yesterday, just to start the stopwatch on CP and get them to bid more in the next 5 days.

KSU too don't have confidence that STB will approve CN offer, but if they pressure CP and get a bid of say $300/Share, and then even STB rejects CN offer, KSU is still better off with new CP bid at $300 rather than older bid at $275. 
I doubt CP can match CN for full value due to debt CP will need to take. But even if gives a bit lower offer, KSU will still consider it as STB is already ok with it

So its all about how CP reacts"

2021-05-14 17:52:36,wallstreetbets,Intel for sure.. they actually manufacture chips in the USA already. They supply the government with a majority of their chips too.
2021-05-14 19:16:15,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs government‚Ä¶so Intel

2021-05-14 16:06:55,wallstreetbets,"Ah good point, thanks"
2021-05-14 13:50:18,wallstreetbets,Finally someone who knows more about semiconductors besides processors.  The US based analog chip makers should benefit more from this than names like AMD and Intel.
2021-05-14 13:13:27,wallstreetbets,How on earth with AMD benefit? They spun their fab shop into another company.
2021-05-14 13:10:23,wallstreetbets,And that‚Äôs the retard comment of the day folks. When u don‚Äôt realize that chips are used in everything from cars to computers. Dd and research folks it‚Äôll help u not look like a clown ü§°
2021-05-14 13:05:46,wallstreetbets,how is Palantir even related to this?

2021-05-14 14:27:36,wallstreetbets,Amd doesn't fabricate domestically.  Why do you retards keep saying it will benefit.
2021-05-14 13:56:15,wallstreetbets,"Oh sorry, what I meant to say was Intel duh and AYYmd get money make more chips so processors markets go üöÄüöÄüöÄüåö

But yeah I don't think any average joe even knows the entire analog side of the semiconductor industry even exists."
2021-05-14 14:09:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, AMD‚Äôs fab is taiwanese. You have a point. but still, AMD is US company. It means they may benefit from the support as well. Besides, US can probably be ok with supporting TSMC. It is good to see strong Taiwanese companies against China. and TSMC opening a new fab in Phoenix.

In short. This support should help also AMD, but probably not as much as Intel."

 Texas Instruments, ADI, Microchip, OnSemi, MPS, Maxim, SiLabs... just some examples of US based chip suppliers that don't focus on CPU/GPU and could benfit.  Looks like they are up quite a bit today"
2021-05-14 15:56:19,wallstreetbets,"TSMC is building a Fab in Arizona, so definitely qualifies for that money, Global Foundries (IO Die and other simple 14nm parts) has some Fabs in New York and with that cash and the current demand might actually finally put their existing and working 7nm into production. So yea AMD, ARM, Apple and Nvidia will get some additional space to make more Chips by association. 

The Big Winners though are: Intel, IBM, TSMC and a bunch of other fabs the others mentioned."

2021-05-14 15:16:43,wallstreetbets,The UWMC Squeeze is real... it‚Äôs harder to convince people of this because we are pointing them to something they don‚Äôt know. Everyone interacts with GME and AMC in daily life. Not many smooth brain apes interact with UWMC unless they bought a home recently.
2021-05-14 12:43:38,wallstreetbets,No way to tell how much is unsettled?  Stock not moving and no volume ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2021-05-14 14:56:54,wallstreetbets,squeeze this nonsense before 5/21.  my calls are hurting.
2021-05-14 13:17:17,wallstreetbets,"Also options contracts expiring next Friday represent nearly [half of the entire available float](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naxmxw/from_ashes_to_the_moon_and_then_back_to_ashes_in/), and 90% of the volume of those contracts is unhedged, meaning this thing is a powder keg waiting to blow.

There are 83.72m shares in the float. That's small. In fact, something like 94% of the company is owned by the CEO, with those 83.72m representing the other 6%. Insiders own 12.85% of that float and institutions own 24.50%, which together is 37.35%. For those of you who never graduated from elementary school, that's 31.27m shares, which makes the free float 51.45 million shares.

Of that, 11.88m shares are short (as of 04/29) which is 23% of the free float. That's important, but not in and of itself enough to squeeze. (Addendum: It is certainly higher now than it was on 04/29, because as of TODAY there are zero shares available to short).

Options volume for 05/21 is huge - between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are approx. 205,500 calls, all out of the money. Their average delta is about 10% (according to Schwab), meaning that as they become ITM, 18.5m shares will be automatically bought by brokers to cover those calls. This is a gamma ramp - it will happen linearly if the stock ticks upwards, creating a positive feedback loop of rising price until they are entirely hedged. At the same time, shorts must cover if the price rises (or must they?). That means that IF the price rises significantly, nearly 30 million shares must be bought in the next 7 days to cover - that's **57% of all the shares available!**

Holy fuck.

Also on Wednesday the stock experienced an extremely sudden 10% surge (when everything else was in a multi-day freefall) and it hasn't gone back down."

Even without considering ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù possibility, UWMC is already a great, undervalued, long term investment worthy company with 5+% of annual dividend rate.
There is a big possibility of Russel index inclusion in early June. Oh, forgot to mention $300M buyback announcement few days ago...

Only thing in common with GME is, it is under shorties‚Äô massive attack."

2021-05-14 17:46:38,wallstreetbets,"Agree, this is a really low risk opportunity.  No offense to the GME crowd, but that companies future was uncertain.

2021-05-14 13:01:17,wallstreetbets,"I understand your point and reasoning. I am not trying to convince you. Only thing I want to say is, comparing RKT to UWM is like comparing apple and orange. They are not the same just because they both deal with mortgage. Excuse me for not bringing the best example, Warby Parker and Luxottica are not the same just because they deal with eyewear.

You will have a better understanding once you fully understand the nature of UWM‚Äôs business as a ‚Äúwholesale‚Äù company.

Unlike RKT, UWM‚Äôs revenue does not heavily rely on refi sales and the interest rate. I am not saying rate increase will not impact. It will be minimal compared to other retailers. UWM is a mortgage wholesale company. Their revenue is growing not just because of the historically low interest rate. You are just looking the part of it, not the whole picture.

I forgot to mention about the ultimatum. Now brokers dealing with UWM are exclusively dealing with UWM and it will increase the revenue.

Biden‚Äôs proposal of long term capital gain increase will demotivate long term investment of non dividends paying companies like alphabet and amazon. Those money can move to real estate. I expect increasing demand of real estate due to inevitable inflation. (We‚Äôve been printing too much $$$.) All of them will positively impact the demand in real estate boom.

I strongly urge you to check out the most recent earnings call on May 11th. You will have a better understanding of UWMC."

UWMC as a company had a good track record before going public and continues to deliver good results after going public.

At the current prices, it pays almost a 6% dividend, if I end up bag holding my shares it'll pay me back over time plus the premiums I can make selling CC.

To me, it's a safe YOLO that can actually pay off, and in the event it doesn't, I don't risk losing all my money like a lot of the other YOLO's I see on here."

2021-05-14 13:07:29,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the response.

Mortgages, whether wholesale or retail depend on interest rates.  Rates are the lowest they've been in history.  The future looks not great unless we take rates negative, which is possible.  

Good luck to you though.  I'm staying away from mortgages but I hope you all win big and I'm wrong.  I like to see people make money on plays regardless of my opinion."
2021-05-14 13:01:21,wallstreetbets,"That's even worse.  Refi's are where the money is at.  Marketing costs a fortune to get each customer and the market has very few differentiators.  A loan is a loan.  Doesn't matter the brand name.  

Good luck to you all though.  Hope the stock goes up."
2021-05-14 12:57:09,wallstreetbets,"That's true, but there is no repeat business.  If everyone knew that current iPhones are the best for the next 20 years, their stock would plummet because they depend on repeat business."

2021-05-14 18:36:53,wallstreetbets,"The ""public float"" is the 103 million total minus the insider shares, which are still on IPO lockup. Pretty close to the 90 million number I see in a lot of places. The SpAC IPO messes up a lot of this data since the share structure changed so recently. 


 Institutional shares are part of public float, but most of the big holdings will be in funds that arent exactly day trading."

2021-05-14 15:59:20,wallstreetbets,"I just picked December because that's when the GME FTDs got the limelight as much as my tiny brain can remember. I recall WSB having calendar memes about reg SHO... And all the dates came and went. I can't really blame people for wanting to have faith that the closeout requirements might have been the catalyst that everyone was hoping for.

Rates are lowest they've been.  Everyone refi'd last year.  They won't again.  

Good point on marketing, I was wrong.  Still don't think I'm wrong about mortgages.  Interest rates have to go up and that will kill refi's."

2021-05-14 16:47:23,wallstreetbets,The entire housing market is a fucking meme right now. Tons of meme potential for Millenials to meme how it takes a literal lottery ticket in options to afford a house.

2021-05-14 16:13:19,wallstreetbets,Show me the data that everyone relied last year?  Because I would venture to be that is simply not even close to being true.
2021-05-14 13:19:29,wallstreetbets,Honestly I hope you all get the üöÄ like you want.  I like seeing people with big gains even if I wasn't on them.  Good luck to you all.
2021-05-14 16:34:30,wallstreetbets,"I refi'd last year and it took 4 months longer than normal because the system was so overwhelmed.  Rates went 1-3% lower than previous years.  That always leads to a boom in refi's (sites below).  In the initial RKT surge last summer, there were a lot of news stories about people refinancing and the high demand.  The issue is that rates can't go lower unless we go to a negative rate like some European countries are testing.  

Who knows what will happen but this industry is 100% dependent on interest rates.  I'd be worried about that risk as an investor, especially with inflation heating up.  One hint of higher rates and all mortgage stocks will selloff like crazy.  If inflation keeps going up, the FED will be forced to raise rates.

2021-05-14 13:40:59,wallstreetbets,"Their tech is very well designed and managed and used by doctors offices every day. In one of those scoundrel written reports about them, they highlighted part of the article that said not many doctors use them...then the very first line after the highlighted part it literally says the office managers use the clover assistant every single day to input the doctors notes and then they fax it to clover. These reports are scaring so many people away, just like they want. They'll buy up all the cheap shares and sell them back to the paper hand for $12 next week and the week after"
2021-05-14 14:08:54,wallstreetbets,"Just curious as to what the tech does. So, the tech supposedly helps doctors make better decisions, but it is only used by office admins?"
2021-05-14 16:31:25,wallstreetbets,"Yes it‚Äôs used by PCP‚Äôa aka the doctors, not ‚Äòoffice admins‚Äô and yes it uses AI to go through entire patient history and give the best clinical recommendation - this also helps them ultimately reduce liability costs"
2021-05-14 14:23:07,wallstreetbets,It helps organize data and uses ai to suggest better methods of treating patients in real time. It makes total sense that all the doctors notes go in it and it makes even more sense that the doctor would get an office administrator to input it. The point is that it's being used everyday. It's possible the doctor doesn't know the brand or company of every product they use

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I‚Äôm bull on ABNB There are few stocks that I actually do extensive research on, normally I just kinda throw money at stuff and hope for the best. But the few stocks that I have put research into are because I feel they were either going to make a strong comeback post COVID or I felt they were a strong yet underrated investment. XOM was a stock I researched heavily and felt it was massively undervalued at $34 a share over a year ago, that has been a great long hold because of its strong dividend. RCL was my quick gain play, I put a third of my total investment in and came out well over double. I have now moved all of that to ABNB, I have liked the company from before it even went public, they are the kings of their sector and ‚ÄúAirBNB‚Äù is a term many use just for simply renting a house, it is a name everyone knows and has became accustom with. That sector is rapidly growing and I feel they have the best grasp on it. Recently the stock has had a massive pull back and put it in pricing that I have taken advantage of because I feel it‚Äôs a steal for where they are headed. I‚Äôm currently holding 85 shares @ an average of 158 a share. 
What are your thoughts on ABNB?"
2021-05-14 11:59:41,wallstreetbets,"I am bull on ABNB as well... Only thing I wonder is if I have to wait more than a year to see a big surge. Anyway, it is about 15% of my portfolio."
2021-05-14 16:10:13,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm long AirBnB, have been before they were public. I‚Äôll likely own them for a decade at least pending some drastic unforeseen change. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a millennial but my generation just doesn‚Äôt even go to hotels when planning travel. The only hotels I‚Äôve stayed in for the last decade have been for business, weddings, or because it was a diiiiiiirt cheap necessity in a desperate situation. 

If AirBnB starts making corporate connections and let‚Äôs me book them for the rare business trip over hotels? Sign me the fuck up. I‚Äôll take the cozy cottage with a sauna a five minute Uber away over the downtown hotel any day. Hell, last time a group of us went to SLC for a conference we did an AirBnB as it was way cheaper for the group to split over a hotel. 

I‚Äôm looking at the macro trends ahead to take all equities down and plan on averaging down over the next few months. Where you‚Äôll see real momentum start to build is this winter and into 2022."
2021-05-14 15:26:45,wallstreetbets,Summary: why you're bull on Airbnb is because you like the stock.

Another thing that got me locked in is when I‚Äôve been hearing 65+ year olds talk about doing an AirBNB instead of a hotel.

I'll buy in again if it drops, thinking maybe 130/120??? If not I'll buy back at 140. I wasnt going to sell initially but the price decline and ER response makes it feel like there is a pending selloff from insiders trying to cashout."

2021-05-14 16:09:52,wallstreetbets,"2021 update:

‚ÄúIt is a pleasure [to be here]‚Ä¶ Your studio looks smaller in person.

Now it's true that many investors have fared poorly in the recent downturn, but there are also plenty of people out there who are managing to ride this thing out by using a thing called diversification: spreading out all of your investments. Let me show you what I mean here. *chart*

You see here that stocks are down 34 points over a two-year period. People who invested in commodities did slightly better and while Treasury notes are down, one group of investors is doing well: the super-rich. They're actually doing great!

Now we don't have the bar graph technology to show you how high their portfolios have risen but if you look out of the window of our offices you'll get some idea. [Their bar] is about six stories taller. 

You see, by starting with lots and lots and lots of money you can still fall back on your gigantic wad even if you lose some.

I recommend Old Money. Once it's been in the family a while it's just about impossible to lose it. Even if you are a complete Fuckup!

Now, I'm looking at you Gabriel Plotkin‚Ä¶

**JS**: What about the people who don't have huge fortunes though?

Well Jon, they should have planned ahead. Now is no time not to
be rich. You have to get creative. Think outside the box. Consider meme stocks. Yes there is a lot of junk out there but for those of you who do your homework, opportunities abound.

For example, take a look at this mint condition collection of AMC calls. Isn't that gorgeous? These calls print on some arbitrary day that has no relation to financial performance and allows AMC to continue using retail investors as a literal ATM! I mean, who knows what these calls could be worth in a couple of years?!

**JS**: But- but Steve I think people looking at more traditional investment instruments such as real estate... 

Okay well the housing market lags the economy so real estate could be in for a rough ride. But these calls- I mean just look at them! Each one bought on margin from the most ironically named brokerage ever!

Jon, what do you think these calls would go for retail?

**JS**: 20 bucks?

More like 9000! But for a limited time they can be yours for only $299! $299 . That's less than $300 for calls that you and your family will cherish as it goes up and up and up in value! Jon, I am rating these calls an official stonk and a strong Buy!

**JS**: Hey that- that's very nice. But we're trying to focus on sound investments here‚Ä¶

Okay! All right, I know who I am dealing with here. You are a savvy investor! Fine, I will throw in this collection of commemorative stonks including BB, NOK, & CLOV! 

**JS**: Steve, oh I don't want to interrupt. Don't you collect this stuff? Is- aren't these just your personal bags? 

‚Ä¶.

No. No. No NO NO NO! I need the cash! I had everything in GME! I need $50,000 by Friday or they're gonna repossess the PT Cruiser! *I LOVE THAT CAR* ‚Ä¶It's new but it looks old. How cool is that?!"

2021-05-14 17:51:57,wallstreetbets,"i agree, i would say trump is a very hard president to write comedy about because so much about him breaks the presidential norms (not in the sense that there isnt material, but hard to phrase it without shitting on him) ,  but all of the talk shows became less funny because it came across less about the jokes, and more about the politics.

If you're pro trump you dont want to watch comedians shitting on your boy (at least the same way they do on the news) , if you're against trump, you dont want the punchline of all the jokes to be essentially.. oh he's so corrupt and dumb and evil!!! that will just depress you.  If you're watching comedy you want to escape from the news , not watch an extension of it.

Just because we have  mass shootings every day doesnt mean we have to let late show monologues be one of the victims.  I think it was a fine needle and stewart and letterman knew how to play it.   If you want to comment on the politics of the day,  it should probably be through satire, otherwise you're just hannity or coumo.

most of the jokes need to be more about choking on pretzels, dodging shoes, injecting bleach.  politicians being corrupt isnt a punchline, everyone basically already gets that.

could you even imagine the colbert report during the trump presidency???"
2021-05-14 16:48:24,wallstreetbets,"There is nothing wrong with political comedy. It just has to be funny and witty. Stewart used to have it. Colbert had it for awhile, the character got sort of old. There is nothing funny about Trevor Noah. He is basically Rachael Maddox with a laugh track."
2021-05-14 16:33:51,wallstreetbets,"Yup, said it perfectly."
2021-05-14 16:30:43,wallstreetbets,TIL I am alone in loving Noah
2021-05-14 17:14:48,wallstreetbets,My Wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs girlfriend‚Äôs boyfriend (which is me) needs a pool.
2021-05-14 18:35:17,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately that's what tracks now. That's what trends. Trevor Noah is Trevor Noah because that's what YouTube has data to say works. You got to realize there's also a generation in there. I feel like blue has become bluer, red has become redder, and although purple is growing as far as public appeal, what actually happens in the voting booth is even more divisive than before, and it's all identity politics."
2021-05-14 18:55:41,wallstreetbets,Bro Trevor Noah is hilarious y‚Äôall are fd up
2021-05-14 17:14:22,wallstreetbets,I like him in his personal rants. But I don't see his show as must see tv. Back in the Stewart days his show and ESPN's top 10 plays were the must-see tv on my TiVo every morning.
2021-05-14 18:31:46,wallstreetbets,tbf when Steward was first out I was in my first job out of college and still a liberal. Maybe that's the difference idk but even now as an anti trump conservative I think Trevor sucks and purposely change the channel when he pops on.
2021-05-14 18:11:29,wallstreetbets,"I love Trevor Noah too, I think he is funny."
2021-05-14 17:16:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah my dogs owner‚Äôs girlfriends boyfriends fathers son (which is me) has been swimming in his bathtub as of late.
2021-05-14 19:21:08,wallstreetbets,Right? Him and amy schumer are so funny. The 2 pillars of comedy for this generation
2021-05-14 17:16:49,wallstreetbets,"Oh he‚Äôs no Stewart. But Stewart also had like decades of experience and commitment to the program. Noahs still a baby in comparison. I personally think he handled COVID pretty well and gets better every year. I mean shit, if you tackle the J/P situation, you‚Äôve got balls. Give the balls some time to grow into diamonds"
2021-05-14 17:30:25,wallstreetbets,You must be rich to have a bathtub big enough to swim in!

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLNY - Pure Digital Infrastructure Play CLNY is a fantastic Pure Play Digital Infrastructure (DI) stock.

Why buy now?

1. Best in class CEO - Ganzi has raised close to $40B from some of the largest institutional funds and investors in the world IN THIS SECTOR. He has been in the Digital Infra field for more than 25 years and understands the connections & synergies between fiber, towers, small cell, data centers etc and is able to connect all the dots. This creates huge cross selling opportunities. Plus Ganzi will receive a well deserved 10M share bonus once CLNY trades over $10 per share for 90 days.
2. CLNY still is being valued as a transitional and traditional commercial RE REIT. Once Wall Street recognizes this DI pure play, the valuation multiple will greatly expand beyond it's peers. The key differentiator between Colony Capital and its competitors, is that [Colony is the only provider that can deliver end-to-end digital infrastructure](https://dgtlinfra.com/colony-capital-2020-review-and-2021-outlook/). Specifically, Colony Capital is investing in all four segments of digital infrastructure, in its core market of the United States.
3. CLNY is positioned to focus on the four key sectors of digital infrastructure. These include towers, data centers, fiber and small cells & distributed antenna systems. Colony is particularly poised to capitalize on secular themes such as the digital infrastructure behind 5G technology. As Marc Ganzi famously said: ‚Äúthe dinner bill for 5G is coming‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs expensive‚Äù.
4. The DI Cap Ex explosion that 5G will create over the next 5-10 years is enormous.  Global interconnection bandwidth is forecast to grow at a 45% CAGR‚Äîtranslating to 16,300+ terabits per second (Tbps).
5. Industries are shifting gears to adapt to global change. As digitization increases, installed capacities are forecast to grow at a tremendous rate for industries across regions.¬†"

2021-05-14 15:00:45,wallstreetbets,I never said I‚Äôm selling calls super OTM. I sell calls close to ITM and get a decent premium out of it. Also $100-$250 of weekly premium for selling 3 covered calls comes out to be 0.33-0.83 per contract.

2021-05-14 11:32:45,wallstreetbets,"Hydrogen fuel cells remind me of nuclear power.

Even though nuclear power is the most effective form of power generation with the smallest negative footprint on the environment and ecosystem, everyone tries to keep it down and only call out one or two short comings.

Hydrogen fuel cells are:

1. Cleanest emissions out of all forms of fuel.

2. Greener than batteries as there is no need to dispose of them.

3. Can have a higher output than batteries.

4. With the proper infrastructure, you can fill up in 5-10 minutes rather than 30mins - 1hour for batteries.

5. We are nearing being able to effectively use solar and wind to power the process of electrolysis to separate hydrogen from oxygen, which would make the fuel for the cells 100% emissions free.

6. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. (Insert angry oil company lobbyist right here)

7. Solar powered homes could one day provide power to homes during the day, while at the same time provide the power for electrolysis to make its own hydrogen fuel for a generator to power the home during the night. Goodbye batteries that we can‚Äôt dispose of, and that have a limited amount of resources.


Hell, the military was looking into Chevy trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells to use in the dessert. One of the reasons; the soldiers could literally drink the emissions as it‚Äôs pure h2o."

That is why I bought a ton of PLUG shares when they were $3. I have not sold any shares. I don't regret it since I know PLUG can climb back up to $50 range. When Texas had the severe snow storm a few months ago, I was laughing when Governor Greg Abbott blamed the snow storm on clean energy such as Hydrogen Fuel Cell and wind turbines.

Hydrogen Fuel Cell is going to play a big part in clean energy/renewal energy. Companies like Toyota are already investing in Fuel Cell for their fuel cell cars to compete with Tesla. I'm not sure if gasoline will be around forever but we saw what can happen like in the east coast with the gas shortage. The pictures of people getting gas and using paper bags as containers frighten me on what could happen in the future"
2021-05-14 11:37:03,wallstreetbets,Well to actually be able to drink that water they have to put in some impurities...
2021-05-14 15:35:22,wallstreetbets,"Look up the efficiency of hydrogen. The creation process and use is highly inefficient when compared to straight electricity.
Any time there are extra steps in a process, it gets less efficient. Inevitably batteries will be faster to charge, and if not, swap them out for new ones."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Deep Value Biotech Play MYOV THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING

https://preview.redd.it/hr6qof99e3z61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=510837b9021d59e04e722af5631daaaf542ac407

OK Retards, first a bit about Myovant's product : If I told you that the same drug could be used to treat prostate cancer in men and uterine fibroids and endometriosis in women you‚Äôd think I was full of shit.  But that is exactly what Myovant is offering with their drug Relugolix.  Those conditions are worsened by estrogen and testosterone so this drug blocks the signal your brain sends out to make them.  Its what‚Äôs called a GNRH antagonist and is a once daily pill. The best treatment now is called Lupron which is an injection that is an agonist so instea of blocking the signal it does the opposite and keeps firing the signal repeatedly until your body says fuck it and refuses to make any more.  This difference means symptoms actually get worse before they get better including making people feel like shit with hot flashes and worsening the prostate cancer and takes way longer to start working.  The big kicker is that there was 54% less cardiac events like heart attacks with Myov‚Äôs Relugolix than Lupron and actually that kills more men with prostate cancer than the cancer itself.  In women the drug is combined with the two drugs of a birth control pill and eliminates your natural estrogen and progesterone which are probably way too high to give you back a proper amount.  Pretty impressive results that were published in the New England Journal of Medicine twice and in women it avoids the bone loss that has plagued earlier attempts at this. TLDR: Good drug published in the world's most prestigious medical journal twice with less badness and more goodness than current treatments.

Here is where the deep value play comes in. What is this worth?  I‚Äôm an ER doc I don‚Äôt have a fucking clue how to value a pharma company but you know does?  The M&A department of Pfizer who gave Myovant a 4.2 billion dollar partnership for half of Relugolix at the end of last year including $850 million that doesn‚Äôt depend on selling a single drug.  So the company should be worth at least $8.4 billion right?  They also havea phase 2 fertility drug but throw that in for free.  So what‚Äôs the current market cap?  $1.87 billion with a just over $20 current price.  Hell Pfizer could have bought the whole company for cheaper and offered well double the current price.  Why the disconnect?  Ah there‚Äôs the rub and the opportunity that lies within because of it.

Myovant is 54% ownded by a Japanese Pharma company, Sumitomo.  It was bought along with 4 other companies that also end in Vant with each of the other 4 being 100% owned by them with Urovant most recently with a deal that just closed.  The writing is on the wall that Myovant is next to be bought and with the stock trading this cheap I can‚Äôt imagine that taking long.  The Sumi CEO has said multiple times that this is a $1 billion a year product and you would think he would want to lowball the value to be able to make a cheaper offer (mind you this was in Japanese to a group of Japanese investment advisors but there is an English translation)  If you are wavering in your decision to buy I recommend watching  [https://www.irwebmeeting.com/ds-pharma/vod/20210323/c52w8qkv/sumitovant\_02\_en/index.html](https://www.irwebmeeting.com/ds-pharma/vod/20210323/c52w8qkv/sumitovant_02_en/index.html) It‚Äôs 2.5 hours where Sumi talks like they already fully own Myovant and are talking up its potential and the role they see in its future.  This is a company that is scared shitless about pretty much their only blockbuster drug going off patent very soon and Myovant is there to plug the gap.  Sumi just reported earnings and has 2 billion in cash on the balance sheet which is a million more than last year ‚Äì hmm what could that be for?  And they are going to have way less R&D expenses as their cancer drugs have experienced a string of failures and are being abandoned.

So how to play this?  Shares may give a 100% return after being bought out which may be imminent.  Another potential catalyst is runup for FDA approval of Relugolix. Given this runup the alternative is the Full YOLO:  The May Options.  They expire in a week so 5 trading days for magic to happen so you could imagine that they are preposterously cheap.  Two ways to play this:  The 17.5 calls are basically trading for only a small premium on what the stock is trading for (strike price plus option price) so you could leverage up and control a shitload of shares for a week or go full YOLO and load up on some Lotto Calls like the 22.5, 25 or 30.

I  know you retards are way too illiterate to read this A1 DD so TL;DR: In our late economic cycle MYOV headed for a huge acquisition and will be bought out at any time for likely more than double the current share price. Can't go tits up.

But I‚Äôm just as tarded as everyone."
2021-05-14 12:58:38,wallstreetbets,"This is a good write up that captures a lot of what is going on. Stock twits board has a surprising amount of really great DD on it as well (for it being stock twits)

I would also add in 3 points.

First, the company has recently announced earnings and proven to Wall Street that they can commercialize and that demand for their product is no issue. They have Pfizer‚Äôs sales team and their own pushing the drug. This is HUGE for uptake. If you check their ER presentation you will get a full hard on, guaranteed.

Second and possibly more important is that there are a lot of catalysts coming up still.

Next week: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe 

June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application 

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some smaller markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment.

Third: institutional ownership is massive! I am not wanting to spend the time with a bunch of numbers, but altogether retail only holds about 5-7%. The big boys bought this up for a reason. They know where it‚Äôs headed and that it‚Äôs a cash cow. Right now, estimates are in the billions for annual sales within a few years.

All in all, the list here is long, I have done tons of research and this is my largest position. The fact that there is a buyout possible is a huge bonus. I think that this is a solid play and as a result have almost 25k shares, 250 calls, and have communicated directly with the company IR department multiple times."
2021-05-14 13:24:20,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion, this could not be more of a sure thing: **MYOV's drug is a pill that cures cancer** \- specifically prostate cancer. I have a friend who is a urologist and he is VERY excited to use this pill for his patients. In simple terms, this drug puts the original IV cancer treatment into a pill (who would prefer to have a needle in their arm if they could take a pill?).

On top of this prostate cancer medication, we will know on June 1st whether this product can be used to treat uterine fibroids. If it is approved, this will be ground breaking for the field of medicine - especially since the most common way to remove uterine fibroids is surgery. 

MYOV is ripe for an increase.

1- Have there been any disclosures about how the tiered payments from Pfizer work? Are these types of agreements usually reasonable (so not making sales an unreachable target)? It would be nice to have the details in an attempt to value the agreement. 

2- You referenced estimates in the billions. Is that for all use cases or just prostate cancer? Do you have any research available on market size. I see info on amount of patients that need this type of drug a year. Not sure how to model that into a $ amount. 

3- If the drug is truly so much better than the alternatives, is it extremely likely that it will own almost all its markets (or at least for prostate cancer)? Even though it is better than the alternatives, could other factors get in the way of it owning most of the market share?"

2021-05-14 10:37:22,wallstreetbets,Big day today for AMC
2021-05-14 14:31:17,wallstreetbets,"(Reuters) - Shares in heavily shorted AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings were up 4.0% in heavy trading on Friday, with the cinema operator the top focus on social media forums popular among retail investors.
The gain was forcing bearish investors out of their positions, according to one analyst who watches short-sellers.
AMC last traded at $13.28 after rising as high as $14.34 earlier in the session, with volume 2.5 times the 10-day moving average and the stock the most-heavily traded on all exchanges.

Buy and hold!"

2021-05-14 11:43:46,wallstreetbets,Disney reporting dramatically slowed subscriber growth on Disney+ is a really good sign for AMC's future.

2021-05-14 15:07:28,wallstreetbets,Inb4 the 500 million new share issuance is back on the table because the CEO got greedy

2021-05-14 10:57:56,wallstreetbets,Look at the 3 month chart of AMC. Based on the pattern there is resistance at 15. In my non proffesional retarded opinion puts are the way to go on this.
2021-05-14 10:25:18,wallstreetbets,"I wish they would have waited till we hit at least 20 to cash out or even higher , not good for our cause and the HOLD line , hope Adam does not cut himself a bonus check from this , seems like all the CEO's do just this after a sell off , would have been happier if he bought 2 million shares"
2021-05-14 11:43:20,wallstreetbets,"Just trying to understand the AMC logic (have no financial interest one way or the other) 

So after a year of being stuck inside with Netflix, people are finally off covid-19 house arrest and they're all going to... rush to a movie theater to sit down and watch a movie? Do the one thing they could've done for the last year?

(I'd expect the surge in nightclubs, gyms, travel, etc. But I'm not a galaxy brain like most on here so you'll have to excuse my simple ways)"

They already had these shares for years and unloaded them over two weeks aka our recent red week. Now they're done selling off and no new dilution and the stock is running. Idk whats so hard to understand about that.
2021-05-14 15:14:40,wallstreetbets,They did it over the last few months
2021-05-14 16:30:47,wallstreetbets,Soon ape
2021-05-14 16:52:20,wallstreetbets,Unless they on memes you ain't making shit

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"
2021-05-14 15:59:59,wallstreetbets,"They said they were going to sell those shares. There's another 400 or so they said they were not selling. This is all hearsay, so do your own research to confirm."
2021-05-14 18:37:21,wallstreetbets,"They proposed a vote to authorize 500 m shares at their annual meeting but it got pushback from the shareholders so they first promised to not issue them this year. Then they pulled the proposal, postponed their annual meeting and immediately issued the 43 m they already had authorized since before. My guess is that they desperately need cash, wanted to issue 500 m new shares but when they got pushback they figured they could sell the ones they had in store and survive until year end then went on to do a youtube interview to plea with the shareholders to vote yes. When that didn't work they pulled the proposal and postponed the meeting while selling the 43 million while trying to figure out a new proposal that the shareholders would vote yes to. Maybe 300 m with the condition of not issuing before jan 1 2022."
2021-05-14 16:01:19,wallstreetbets,thats the question that i came to see.. any responses?
2021-05-14 15:18:38,wallstreetbets,Hold that shit like a sommmeeeboooOooODy
2021-05-14 12:55:27,wallstreetbets,"Streaming, like so many other entertainment media, stopped being a good investment as soon as competition entered the market. It's one of those strange quirky areas in which more competition is actually bad for both business and the consumer, a bit like sports coverage - once people start being asked to buy five or six recurring subscriptions to access the bulk of the content they want, the bubble bursts and piracy returns to the top of peoples' go-to method of obtaining content.

See this all the time in Europe with sporting championships. The Rugby Union Champions' Cup is a good example, when it was restricted to Sky it was insanely popular, once they split it between Sky and BT piracy rates went through the roof because people just weren't willing to shell out for multiple expensive sports packages just to watch one tournament.

For that reason alone I'd see the streaming bubble burst relatively soon. The golden era is well and truly behind us."
2021-05-14 11:06:32,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm buying 50 more shares, I see you, we see you."
2021-05-14 15:17:07,wallstreetbets,So calls cool
2021-05-14 10:41:20,wallstreetbets,"What cause? Your cause is to make a bunch of money, and so is AMCs because they‚Äôre a corporation. This is a smart move from them."
2021-05-14 14:48:02,wallstreetbets,AMC was struggling pre pandemic so I don‚Äôt see any rebound potential as the market cap is higher than prepandemic levels at this point
2021-05-14 12:36:37,wallstreetbets,So many people are complaining about not being able to go to theaters
2021-05-14 11:51:25,wallstreetbets,Lots of big movies have been delayed due to covid also- so we could have a couple record years ahead.
2021-05-14 13:06:20,wallstreetbets,"AMC‚Äôs financials are irrelevant. The only thing that they could do that matters is dilute and that‚Äôs already out of the way. I‚Äôm approaching this like I would a useless cr*pto.

AMC IS A STORE OF VALUE"
2021-05-14 12:42:24,wallstreetbets,"Lots of big movies, like the Marvel franchise, have been delayed a year. They're all basically a guaranteed billion dollars and they announced they'll only be released in theaters. So it'll force people to go if they don't want to wait until they're out of theaters."
2021-05-14 15:15:49,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôve done that tho look at box office numbers for kong 
Demon slayer 
And mortal kombat"
2021-05-14 15:15:12,wallstreetbets,14 call for middle of June if you‚Äôre lucky
2021-05-14 16:19:08,wallstreetbets,I bought $100. That's all I can afford atm.
2021-05-14 18:04:26,wallstreetbets,I was at AMC last week and it was nice to see people out there.
2021-05-14 16:20:14,wallstreetbets,Look at its pre-covid numbers and sell around there.
2021-05-14 16:35:29,wallstreetbets,Untill it skyrockets past GME
2021-05-14 16:17:59,wallstreetbets,If it was me...I would hold until $250
2021-05-14 13:29:07,wallstreetbets,We were red for an entire week while they sold these off. Now they're done and the stock is running. This is good news and is NOT DILUTION like so many people are saying. They've already diluted. They have 2 billion in equity now. This isn't bad news and I don't understand why everyone is perceiving it as bad.
2021-05-14 13:32:23,wallstreetbets,"No they don't, because if they did... AMC would be worth 90-100 dollars right now."
2021-05-14 18:12:36,wallstreetbets,"When a user named Admiral Asswank has shown more credibility than you, it might be time to rethink your financial decisions."
2021-05-14 17:30:09,wallstreetbets,Can we please get rid of admiral asshat?
2021-05-14 15:56:19,wallstreetbets,Dude that ship has sailed. AMC hype was never at gamestop levels and lack of movies out now will only make it go lower. Move on.

2021-05-14 13:48:06,wallstreetbets,"People are being bamboozled.. it sucks.. learn from the past few months. The same people who keep saying hold or buy the dip are the  ones who already pulled out and made returns. Most of them on here have said that they already pulled what they initially invested and left over what they are willing to lose which shows the hypocrisy. 

The other worst part is the lies and fake news that people want to go see movies and that reopening the movie theaters is some how going to thrive.. especially when streaming services are so much convenient. Another thing is that concessions and even prices might go up because of inflation..."
2021-05-14 18:47:24,wallstreetbets,"No thanks, we are good with AMC üöÄ"
2021-05-14 18:00:22,wallstreetbets,$12.8 cost basis...... need less to say I‚Äôm not longer up 1% cause it‚Äôs hovering around 12.8 right now lol
2021-05-14 16:20:09,wallstreetbets,"Just get on the floor like I said before
Y'all remember that down low
Just put a little dip with it
Now roll those hips with it
Pop it, push it, rock it, roll it
Can't control it?
I can hold it"
2021-05-14 10:57:22,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôd be great, got a $20 call I‚Äôve been sitting on for months"
2021-05-14 16:23:25,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao, 1st post 1 day ago.

Keep trying to p&d buddy.

Tell Ken not to drop the soap."
2021-05-14 17:45:48,wallstreetbets,A soft touch to 20 next week. But whether to hold on is the question...
2021-05-14 18:58:29,wallstreetbets,"liar ""big stock"" like the deep state?"
2021-05-14 15:26:14,wallstreetbets,Can you PM me those discord servers?
2021-05-14 13:23:59,wallstreetbets,"Yep, so stupid these amc clowns talk about it so brazenly like they're not colluding"
2021-05-14 16:42:53,wallstreetbets,Who cares the law can lick my asshole
2021-05-14 13:23:32,wallstreetbets,Stop market manip
2021-05-14 12:57:16,wallstreetbets,Wasn‚Äôt a bad move in end January. He just got fked over.
2021-05-14 16:36:26,wallstreetbets,Would have been a perfectly fine move if they hadn‚Äôt manipulated the market against us to protect the hedges
2021-05-14 13:00:30,wallstreetbets,"I have a wife, that should explain it enough"
2021-05-14 16:24:34,wallstreetbets,U missin out then
2021-05-14 10:00:58,wallstreetbets,They expire today
2021-05-14 10:27:10,wallstreetbets,"I was watching when the 2 million jumped the volume , even Trey noticed it so this above statement is just not true"
2021-05-14 13:35:17,wallstreetbets,Mostly because I want to watch a movie and do so in an ambiguously sticky seat.
2021-05-14 19:47:45,wallstreetbets,what if you got a share of AMC with every movie ticket!  HELLO MARKETING TEAM?YES ILL TAKE THE JOB.
2021-05-14 15:02:04,wallstreetbets,Because each movie theatre loses tens of thousands of dollars per week. :)
2021-05-14 16:24:01,wallstreetbets,The fucking theta gods shined down on you today like the eye of a hurricane. You are a beacon to us all.
2021-05-14 13:32:46,wallstreetbets,"Same, I bought really cheap back in December and have been holding them. I bought around 100 shares and sold 60 @ $13. Honestly, If this was going to take off like GME it would have kept rising all week. 
I still hope to see it go up but at this rate I doubt it is."
2021-05-14 13:30:44,wallstreetbets,Shut the fuck up you don't know anything
2021-05-14 15:12:34,wallstreetbets,They did that over a couple of months
2021-05-14 12:38:41,wallstreetbets,Yes lol it‚Äôs never ‚Äúgood‚Äù for short term investors currently long
2021-05-14 13:31:46,wallstreetbets,BUY AND HOLD
2021-05-14 14:10:04,wallstreetbets,This is the ape way
2021-05-14 18:18:08,wallstreetbets,TO THE MOON
2021-05-14 17:37:22,wallstreetbets,Explain how please
2021-05-14 18:19:06,wallstreetbets,Exactly
2021-05-14 17:18:20,wallstreetbets,Stupid rich apes
2021-05-14 17:41:41,wallstreetbets,"Not always, it could be that they're a. Overvalued b. Economically fucked and need quick cash c. Financing a new investment/strategy or takeover. That being said, AMC is doing it for reason a & b. Overvalued and fucked if they dont bring in cash"
2021-05-14 19:11:52,wallstreetbets,Apes think borrowing 1 billion dollars at 10% interest is bullish
2021-05-14 16:28:44,wallstreetbets,For me 10k
2021-05-14 13:31:10,wallstreetbets,"In what fucking planet you actual moron

*sigh*"
2021-05-14 15:52:45,wallstreetbets,Care to explain how you came to that conclusion? Because it really seems like you‚Äôre just talking out of your ass.
2021-05-14 11:44:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's time for a new squeeze, GME is a floater right now."
2021-05-14 15:54:20,wallstreetbets,Lmao this is blatantly wrong.
2021-05-14 13:35:16,wallstreetbets,Why‚Äôs AMC stock going down?!
2021-05-14 16:58:29,wallstreetbets,"AMC puts printin every time, they already are"
2021-05-14 18:34:42,wallstreetbets,Nah diamond hands on this one I bought more.
2021-05-14 16:02:34,wallstreetbets,Hearsay? Didn‚Äôt he do an AMA? I‚Äôm not sure I need to do DD on it.
2021-05-14 19:16:36,wallstreetbets,"Thank you Sofsjo for the clarification. Do they have plans to do anything with those funds? Or is it to live today die tomorrow situation? I‚Äôve always liked AMC and believed in their business, however, COVID really put a wrench in that. I know they‚Äôve raised funds in the past and did nothing with it except pay the bills."
2021-05-14 16:01:56,wallstreetbets,Just you two.
2021-05-14 15:19:23,wallstreetbets,Not selling less that $300üòÇüòÇ
2021-05-14 16:11:09,wallstreetbets,If AMC did theater streaming pre release I am in. They could even do a monthly sub and send popcorn and snacks.
2021-05-14 10:44:06,wallstreetbets,"They are sucking money from us investors , their cause is to open all their theaters and sell tickets , he did this in January to us too , he is just like those blood sucker day traders"
2021-05-14 18:04:56,wallstreetbets,Yep.  Still a risk for bankruptcy if they don't start putting out new movies also. Hopefully they make it.
2021-05-14 13:31:00,wallstreetbets,"Yea, i had no idea that was such a big thing for some people üòÖ

I, personally, am not the biggest fan of spending $20 for popcorn but hey, what do i know? My portfolio is 100% GME so i might be a retard ü§∑"
2021-05-14 12:39:47,wallstreetbets,"AMC can't pay their debt even with pre-covid revenue, without some drastic massive change to their business model 2-3 big movies aren't going to save them."
2021-05-14 12:23:07,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha, that's fair. I wouldn't mind seeing Bond in theater. Probably Fast and the Furious 9 too."
2021-05-14 14:14:16,wallstreetbets,Exactly. My play is a bit different. The fact amc is a loser is good because it draws in the short sellers. It‚Äôs my bait so I can come around it eat them up.
2021-05-14 16:02:07,wallstreetbets,Only released in theaters and thepiratebay.
2021-05-14 19:44:30,wallstreetbets,So... Around 14.00
2021-05-14 16:13:28,wallstreetbets,Means low buys for us and higher returns. Let the doubters jump on our train after it's picked up momentum.
2021-05-14 17:17:25,wallstreetbets,why?
2021-05-14 15:54:21,wallstreetbets,"Seriously. After being given the option to stream movies online same day as theaters I don't see why anybody wirh a decent TV would bother going to the movies. Even occasionally. 

AMC is not gonna get much higher that this. I bought at around $14 and plan to just break even now that it's high again. It took three months to get this high, I'm certain their peak has hit. 

Theaters are done."
2021-05-14 18:15:40,wallstreetbets,I'm at 15.31 avg px :')
2021-05-14 12:15:47,wallstreetbets,"what strike?  I bought 10 in december with a $3.50 strike and 1/21/22 expiration and just no idea how long I should hold.

Could have sold them for $2k/each when it was $17/share in late Jan lol."
2021-05-14 13:33:04,wallstreetbets,Same... 6/4 expiry... I want the tendies yesterday tho.

2021-05-14 13:16:56,wallstreetbets,For amc. Yes it was dumb with that cos basis.
2021-05-14 13:21:53,wallstreetbets,"Yes it was.

It was absolutely the dumbest move lol"
2021-05-14 16:43:40,wallstreetbets,Nope. At some point you have to take responsibility for buying overpriced equities fueled by speculation.

Yeah.

2021-05-14 16:55:07,wallstreetbets,"Well I didn‚Äôt read the AMA, I‚Äôm just telling you what I heard from others."
2021-05-14 16:16:32,wallstreetbets,AMC would never do this. They would have to invest millions in a streaming platform AND still pay for the content. This would be a noop. This is why so many streaming platforms make their own content. It's a race to the bottom now.
2021-05-14 11:00:47,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre delusional. It is not the job of AMC to make a bunch of teenagers on the internet money off gambling stocks. Of course they want to open theaters and sell tickets, what the hell do you think their business model is?"
2021-05-14 14:38:18,wallstreetbets,"I do not miss the theaters at all. But lots of family and friends have expressed great anticipation for movie theaters reopening. To each their own, I‚Äôm not knocking them"
2021-05-14 13:39:57,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I'm Italian and used to joke about popcorn's price a lot. Thanks God after first covid wave (I mean, last summer where cinemas here were basically open) they dropped prices a lot. 10‚Ç¨ for popcorns+ticket sounds legit to me, it's not that bad of a deal. They're good af and I love cinemas!  
I don't care about AMC tho, I don't even know what it is tbh."
2021-05-14 12:43:03,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree, that‚Äôs why I sold at $12.50 and was happy.  Same day release on HBO Max is what I hope the future holds.  Just saying I can understand the bullish case.  Big movies plus smaller chains that did go under will provide enough revenue the next couple years to keep the doors open.  But long term the home watching experience has improved in a huge way and theaters aren‚Äôt needed.  (Same as the death of arcades when home consoles could do the same things)"
2021-05-14 16:16:05,wallstreetbets,"So who will take their place? With supply and demand, AMC will rebound until there is better market competition. Remember AMC hurt due to the pandemic, and so did everyone else. All other competitions are hurting even worse."
2021-05-14 14:24:25,wallstreetbets,"exactly, none of this has anything to do with anything but supply and demand for the stock itself. Any talk of amc as anything but a ticker is fud."
2021-05-14 19:51:08,wallstreetbets,"Money is money, and that's prob the bottom line."

Meanwhile GME had only 1.5x their normal trading volume yesterday (compared to the last 1-2 months) and it went up like $20 bucks and today it's on pace to go back down to it's usual low volume again while still maintaining the majority of it's price increase üòÖ"
2021-05-14 12:52:49,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, there may be an initial surge when everything eventually normalizes and people can go out again but ultimately covid has opened the door for new opportunities that it turns out people really fucking like...like watching a movie opening day from the comfort of your home via streaming service.

Me personally I only ever watched movies in the theatre that were really meant for a theatre experience like IMAX, without some other unique ""pull"" it's going to be nearly impossible for AMC to massively increase their revenue above pre-covid before the timer expires on their debt."

2021-05-14 16:42:07,wallstreetbets,That article clearly says that they aren't going to issue the 500 million shares NOT that they don't need shareholder approval. You should reread that.

Idk, I'm glad there's a big and nice community of AMC and I'm happy for them and I'm glad they do their own researches (which I'd love to hear anyway just for curiosity).

You don't know what you're talking about. This filing gave them the option, which they took, to ISSUE and sell 43 million new shares. 

The 500 million share issuance measure allows them the board - WITHOUT VOTING FROM SHAREHOLDERS - to register up to 500M shares whenever they want. It's hilarious to me that this took 3 minutes of searching, but you're so emotionally invested in it."
2021-05-14 16:27:25,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Definitely would have to happen before the industry pushes theaters out. Most likely wouldn't happen.

2021-05-14 12:27:01,wallstreetbets,you need to understand what calls are they are different from shares. Shares you can hold forever or until the company goes bankrupt. Calls are essentially a gamble where you say I will pay you 500 dollars to buy 100 shares at 10 dollars before a certain date. Now if the shares go over 15 dollars you are making a profit since you can pay 1000 dollars and get 100 shares with a value of over 1500$. The problem is if the share price does not reach those 15 dollars or much worse if it does not reach 10$ by the set date then your contract is worthless since you could buy 100 shares for less then 1000$. That is what happened to the person you initially responded to his contract gamble did not pay off so the value went to zero. The numbers here are made up a contract like that would probably not be that expensive so you would start making a profit soon after 10$ probably

No. They weren't. That doesn't even make any sense. The FILING was ""already there"", which gave them the option to issue and sell the shares when they pleased. What do you think ""Issue"" means in the filing? Here, I'll help you.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC , this seems huge. Position in 2nd slide , LFG!!! "
2021-05-14 11:00:15,wallstreetbets,"Fee is up to 77.4% now!

EDIT: 95.9% as of 12:15!!!"
2021-05-14 13:32:27,wallstreetbets,"Options contracts expiring next Friday represent nearly [half of the entire available float](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naxmxw/from_ashes_to_the_moon_and_then_back_to_ashes_in/), and 90% of the volume of those contracts is unhedged, meaning this thing is a powder keg waiting to blow.

There are 83.72m shares in the float. That's small. In fact, something like 94% of the company is owned by the CEO, with those 83.72m representing the other 6%. Insiders own 12.85% of that float and institutions own 24.50%, which together is 37.35%. For those of you who never graduated from elementary school, that's 31.27m shares, which makes the free float 51.45 million shares.

Of that, 11.88m shares are short (as of 04/29) which is 23% of the free float. That's important, but not in and of itself enough to squeeze. (Addendum: It is certainly higher now than it was on 04/29, because as of TODAY there are zero shares available to short).

Options volume for 05/21 is huge - between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are approx. 205,500 calls, all out of the money. Their average delta is about 10% (according to Schwab), meaning that as they become ITM, 18.5m shares will be automatically bought by brokers to cover those calls. This is a gamma ramp - it will happen linearly if the stock ticks upwards, creating a positive feedback loop of rising price until they are entirely hedged. At the same time, shorts must cover if the price rises (or must they?). That means that IF the price rises significantly, nearly 30 million shares must be bought in the next 7 days to cover - that's 57% of all the shares available!

Holy fuck.

Also on Wednesday the stock experienced an extremely sudden 10% surge (when everything else was in a multi-day freefall) and it hasn't gone back down."

2021-05-14 11:14:59,wallstreetbets,Not sure if you‚Äôre replying to me but a higher borrow fee means shorts have more of an incentive to cover because it costs them more money to hold.
2021-05-14 14:53:53,wallstreetbets,It means there is no one willing to buy your calls if you were to sell them (either to open or to close). A broker will always be willing to write you a new call though - and at $5 that is extremely cheap. It also means there is no longer any reason for anyone to buy calls above that strike. The open interest is the number of calls already written.
2021-05-14 09:57:28,wallstreetbets,Nice spread! Good luck friend.

The CEO is a beast. And not only did they reaffirm their dividend (ex date in June) and just make $860M in the first quarter, they announced the approval of a $300M stock buy back. That‚Äôs big money ! But let‚Äôs dive deeper. The $300M share buy back is of the class A shares that are in the float. $UWMC has a very small float.

104M shares. $300M / $6.70 = 45M. That means at current prices they can buy back nearly 44% of the entire F\*\*kin float. You have never heard of that before and you probably never will again. On earnings call yesterday CEO says ‚ÄúWe can start buying shares tomorrow and I am a buyer at this price !‚Äù

So that leaves 60M shares left in the float. Institutions own 23M of them (I bet it‚Äôs higher) short interest is close to 13M based on latest data.

This just caused the borrow rate to increase by 5X ! new data shows short borrow rates just hit 25%

Apes, there are less than 35M shares freely traded in this stock right now.

On top of all this we still have Russell Inclusion to be announced in June and another blow out 2Q is in the works.

This is NOT financial advice but I can't think of a reason I shouldn‚Äôt park a few dollars in a highly profitable stock, trading at all time lows, paying a 6% dividend with a current p/e under 4?

My position 7900 shares @ 7.64 and 45x 6/18 8c

TL,DR üèò=üíµüíµüíµüíµ = UWMC üöÄüöÄüöÄü§ë  


Edit: since I posted there are only 2,000 shares to loan and the borrow rate is 35%!!?!??

2021-05-14 13:47:10,wallstreetbets,They need to try to keep it under $7.50. If that gives that means the chain of ITM calls opens up. They need to calculate if they lose more on short interest or having to cover all the contracts

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CNBC's Jim Cramer Is So Full of Shit... Don't ask me why but I often watch Mad Money on CNBC. I also make note of where I got recommendations when I buy stocks, and I'm starting to realize how bad his recommendations often are and how dishonest he is about his bad calls. A few examples:

&#x200B;

1) Last night, someone called into to ask about Aeva and he said he couldn't recommend it. Oh really? Actually, HE DID recommend it just several weeks ago. I know because I bought it soon afterwards and it tanked. I understand things change and he's entitled to change his mind but how about at least saying something like, ""I know I recommended this one before, but I can't now because of inflation or whatever...""

2) XL Fleet. Same story as above. He recommended it, then he didn't and pretended like the earlier recommendation never happened.

3) Tech meltdown. In the runup to the 2020 election, Big Jim was pimping hard for Biden. Okay, fine, everyone's entitled to their opinion. But he kept repeatedly claiming that Biden would great for tech stocks, especially Apple, because he would improve relations with China. This call has been catastrophically wrong, at least so far but no acknowledgment of this whatsoever from him. As a so -called expert, shouldn't he have known that the policies Biden was calling for (huge increase in government spending, massive stimulus checks, enhanced unemployement checks, etc, etc) would cause inflation and inflation would be bad for many of these high multiple tech stocks? 

&#x200B;

Yeah, I know. I shouldn't be taking recommendations from Cramer and other so-called TV experts. That's on me...but I just wanted to add my thoughts here in case others take him seriously. And yes, I'm sure some of his recommendations also pan out well but I wish he would man up and admit when he makes bad calls."

My opinion. Only use tv, social media, friends, whatsapp groups, discord etc to **find** stocks. To hear about it etc. Then do some research.

I'm not saying you always have to do fundamental analysis etc just make sure you at least check the sentiment about the stock in multiple places and over time. Check it with your own future plans and strategies. If you can, do not buy it right away. If it's really time sensitive (9/10 its not) you can alwas buy or sell half of what you where thinking.

Get emotion out of investing. You make money **before** you buy the stock, you stay relaxed because you did research **before** you bought. If it doesn't feel right you have too much stake in the game.

before covid even hit, these same economists were worried that inflation was far too low. and 2020 saw DEFLATION, so the current inflation numbers are going to look skewed. if put on a graph where covid didn‚Äôt happen, it‚Äôs actually lower inflation than predicted.

anyone trying to sell you this inflation bullshit is lying to you. 100%.

edit: to put a finer fucking point on this stupid shit... those same doomsayers are just predicting something that literally none of the data backs up in any way. even the most recent data doesn‚Äôt point to inflation at all. it‚Äôs literally lack of essential workers (because many died during the essential part of the pandemic) and supply chains breaking due to a massive increase in demand.

a couple trillion dollars isn‚Äôt going to cause any real increase in inflation especially since most of it is being spent in a very diverse array of ways. this is the same logic as ‚Äúoh man, mcdonald‚Äôs CANT increase their min. wage to $15 because burgers would cost $5 more‚Äù. that‚Äôs so fucking stupid and wrong that whoever says that should be immediately thrown into the nether realm."

2021-05-14 14:45:52,wallstreetbets,"I actually went back and read your whole post.... I see what you did there! 

But honestly as someone who has listened to him nearly daily for at least 14-15 years... the best way to think about him is as a high school teacher. He opens every show saying he wants to teach you. The first segment of the show is a rundown of what happened in the market that day and why it happened. This information is priceless. I recommend people who do not have time to watch his show at least try and catch that first segment. Just to get the temperature of the market. The CEO interviews are priceless. I take this opportunity to try and judge if the CEO is full of shit or not. The other segments are usually caller interactions, and I usually just listen here for thoughts on things I already own. 

He tells you to do the homework, and often teaches you how to do the homework. I have many times seen him own up to calls that went wrong. To say that he does not do this shows that you do not listen to his show everyday or in full. 

The Bear Sterns controversy was complete and utter bullshit. As someone who was a fan of Jon Stewart, I lost a ton of respect for him on that poorly cut interview. People have to look at context. If you followed this whole thing, then you cannot honestly say that Cramer was wrong on that. If people had listened to Cramer during that time, they would have saved and made a whole lot of money. Cramer called the bottom of that recession, though he gave full credit to Mark Haines. 

Look I get it... nobody wants to do the work. People tune in to Cramer looking for a hot stock tip, then lose their shit when they take a dive in and right after you establish that full position, the stock craters 20% and you panic out. Been there done that. Once I looked in the mirror and realized that I did not follow any of the advice he had given, I placed the blame on myself where it belonged.

2021-05-14 10:09:48,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve always said Cramer is crook. Look at him.
2021-05-14 10:11:58,wallstreetbets,Did he poop his pants? Or why is he so full of shit?
2021-05-14 10:30:13,wallstreetbets,"cnbc in general is sort of retarded. they tried REALLY REALLY hard to keep screeching and pushing their inflation narrative, but every day new data comes out that they cant deny that deflation will be eventually what happens"

2021-05-14 09:45:19,wallstreetbets,Cramer has webbed feet and that's all you need to know
2021-05-14 10:10:42,wallstreetbets,He says buy you short. He says sell you buy
2021-05-14 10:26:29,wallstreetbets,He's an idiot
2021-05-14 10:27:31,wallstreetbets,It's obvious hes on a lot of companies payroll. If you know what I'm saying.......

2021-05-14 11:10:51,wallstreetbets,this inflation meme is getting unbearable. it was coiling up for the longest time. an infrastructure bill changes nothing
2021-05-14 11:22:01,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt think the verdict is out on number 3 unless he said tech would sky rocket in the first 150 days of Biden being in office.

2021-05-14 12:38:16,wallstreetbets,Cramer's an entertainer before he's a trader. Recommendations are based on current conditions. Three weeks ago might as well be 100 years.
2021-05-14 12:41:43,wallstreetbets,"Any popular personality on TV is just that. They're performance artists and it's really just there for some for some mindless ear candy (which, we all love and has a place in our lives).

My 3-year old daughter and I watch Undisputed with Skip and Shannon every morning having cereal and, as long as you remember to never take any shit they say even remotely seriously, it's a lot of fun.

There are ethical questions for sure when a performance artist isn't just coming up with takes to defend America's team but is actually recommending you spend your money, but that's another topic."
2021-05-14 12:57:47,wallstreetbets,Cramer does have occasionally some good ideas but his timing is usually bad. For example i bought T at 28.50. He said many times do not buy it. At 32 he got behind the stock. If he recommends a stock you really dig try to wait for a pullback before pulling the trigger.
2021-05-14 13:01:40,wallstreetbets,Wait are you talking about that guy who was in Ironman?
2021-05-14 13:04:36,wallstreetbets,Learn the hardware to go with what he says is a sell.ü§£
2021-05-14 13:06:32,wallstreetbets,You mean Cramer can‚Äôt predict the stock market???
2021-05-14 13:07:29,wallstreetbets,To be honest my paper hands and being a newbie cause my stupid losses. My instincts are shite so now I'm doing the opposite of my instincts . What could go wrong ?
2021-05-14 13:10:09,wallstreetbets,OP is really really bad at putting data into context lol
2021-05-14 13:12:01,wallstreetbets,3. AAPL is trading like $20 higher now than it was in Nov. 2020.

2021-05-14 13:25:25,wallstreetbets,"I now like to go visit Yahoo Finance, go through the top daily losers, buy whatever is on sale for the day and wait for it to go up. I don't even care much about the technicals, buy low, sell high (how high is up to you!) (please do not take this as financial advise. I'm freaking dumbass). This probably irritates people who study the market and throw their hands up in the air - like Jim Cramer"
2021-05-14 13:26:37,wallstreetbets,I like watching Mad Money and see Jim Cramer yell at me for being stupid!!! Or even Warren Buffet. Makes me happy when he's enraged
2021-05-14 13:27:13,wallstreetbets,Well yea he is the worst.. btw pltr to the moon make sure you jump on it soon
2021-05-14 13:29:13,wallstreetbets,"Also, he did not like fubo when it was $17 but he likes it now at $20."
2021-05-14 13:30:26,wallstreetbets,"While I think Cramer knows his shit in private,...in public, on his TV show, he's an entertainer not an analyst.  Like others have said, you usually do best inversing his picks."
2021-05-14 13:31:17,wallstreetbets,"I'm usually a fan of Cramer, and find myself defending him against the critics. However, I too have noticed the same pattern of him contradicting himself lately VERY OFTEN."

2021-05-14 13:37:29,wallstreetbets, Jim Cramer looks like Louis CK on crack
2021-05-14 13:39:32,wallstreetbets,"Here are some other interesting facts you may have missed:

Water is wet
Earth is not flat"
2021-05-14 13:41:58,wallstreetbets,"Easiest way to look like a stock picking genius is to throw out tons of recommendations and highlight the ones you got right and ignore the ones you got wrong. 

Those trading gurus selling courses or signal services do this all the time.

For people like Cramer, his job is to create liquidity. His rich friends can't sell as high if retail traders aren't FOMOing into the stock. Of course, can't make this obvious so gotta throw in random recommendations that end up correct longer term so people keep taking his advice."
2021-05-14 13:43:29,wallstreetbets,"Read Peter Lynches ""One up on Wall Street! Anytime I have deviated from his recommendations on stocks I have lost money. One of his basics is ""Never take a stock tip."" I am amazed people watch these guys and actually buy what they say. You never know their motive. DO it the old fashioned way. Good, dividend paying companies and time for compounding as you reinvest dividends and gains. Hell even buying the boring index funds do much better than picking stocks yourself, the same way they consistently beat the pros."

2021-05-14 13:55:18,wallstreetbets,"Jim Cramer is an entertainer.  Would you watch a show that told you to buy index funds and hold?  There would be nothing to talk about.  That show would have 1 episode and it would be 5 minutes long.

He talks about stocks daily, of course it's going to be bullshit.  Just like the 24 hour news cycle, it's all bullshit.

Wait a minute, this is a wendy's, cash out your retirement, liquidate your assets and go all in on PLTR!!!"
2021-05-14 13:55:47,wallstreetbets,"How does anyone take the guy seriously? He has been wrong for so long, his right hand has disappeared."

2021-05-14 14:03:38,wallstreetbets,This should go without saying..
2021-05-14 14:03:59,wallstreetbets,Well I dont like Jim Cramer but the problem is NOT him. Problem is YOU listening to him. Even watching Mad money is a sin
2021-05-14 14:06:33,wallstreetbets,Key with Cramer.  Buy when he says to and then IMMEDIATELY sell the next day.
2021-05-14 14:08:28,wallstreetbets,He's loud so he must be correct.
2021-05-14 14:08:54,wallstreetbets,"With all due respect, if he gets to you, he's already won."
2021-05-14 14:11:27,wallstreetbets,"Cramer is a turbobull he says everything going to moon, then memoryholes the wrong predictions.  It's basically the whole game of these ""stock analyst"" types."
2021-05-14 14:17:12,wallstreetbets,Hey man his dad used to beat him OK ?
2021-05-14 14:17:15,wallstreetbets,Crapping on Cramer is basically manure on a karma farm
2021-05-14 14:19:40,wallstreetbets,"He's guessing just like any of us. The difference is he's been doing it for longer than most of us have been alive so he does have some good big picture insight. But when it comes to actually picking good tickers and trading well? He's nearly always behind. He'll tell you to buy a stock that rallied massively because it's hot as hell when in reality it's likely ready for a huge correction. And that small cap that's ready for a massive rally? He wouldn't recommend it because it hasn't run yet. Once it runs he'll recommend it and then at that point it's just about ready to dump or pull back substantially. The market is forward-thinking, he is not (usually)."

2021-05-14 14:29:28,wallstreetbets,"The stimulus checks have been great for tech companies like Apple everyone is spending their stimulus products. 

Who gives a fuck about small cap tech companies like Uber? It‚Äôs the ones like Apple that drives this market."
2021-05-14 14:35:14,wallstreetbets,"On your third point, there are a good number of economists that believe the increase in inflation is due to the pandemic receding and supply chains/production re-aligning.  In other words, the expectation is that the bump in inflation last month is tied more to the effects of the pandemic on production and supply chain versus any specific policies being pushed by Biden.

(It should also be noted that stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment have been in play for over a year now, so  the idea that this is due to anything specific to Biden is somewhat absurd. Likewise for increase in government spending: it's questionable whether any meaningful increase in spending will occur, with Republicans outright rejecting such increases and Manchin rejected things like eliminating the filibuster. So the scenario I outlined above, as stated by a number of economists, is much more likely)."
2021-05-14 14:37:13,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is the Bill Maher of the stock market.  So completely out of touch.  I still don't know how he has a job after the Bear Stearns fiasco.
2021-05-14 14:40:00,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is the best.  When he says juke I jive.
2021-05-14 14:40:19,wallstreetbets,But why did you buy Aeva and not GME and AMC. Are you a retard?

If people dont watch he wont keep his job."

Unlike most of Reddit, I believe his heart is in the right place, and it‚Äôs not his fault he can‚Äôt predict the market - no one can. I wouldn‚Äôt advise anyone to buy or sell anything solely because Jim said so, but if you did just take it as a lesson and move on. Borrowed conviction rarely works."

2021-05-14 16:38:58,wallstreetbets,"Funny story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen.  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show - it may have been ""Mad Money"" or similar.  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most amazing woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  You could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, after my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another person as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show."

He also recommends so many stocks it‚Äôs impossible that he did dd on them all... he seems to be influenced by what his audience wants to hear and tends to be positive about almost any company willing to come on his show... if it‚Äôs a good (maybe better stock) than a competitor he likes or a company that wouldn‚Äôt come on his show he automatically dislikes it... he also reverses frequently... so ive learned to take his recommendations with a grain of salt and basically watch the intro for his more market environment education related stuff and because he moves markets or at least certain stocks sometimes... usually by the time he‚Äôs said something it‚Äôs already been hyped at that moment to it‚Äôs highest intra-day or after hours point and i would have made more money shorting it

Also if it‚Äôs popular on social media or with Cathy wood he automatically hates it"

2021-05-14 17:06:04,wallstreetbets,"If Jim Cramer thought Biden would improve relations with China, he has no understanding of geopolitics.  Biden will stabilize relations with China, and over the long term it's possible that they could improve, but there was never for a second going to be an instant turn around on China relations.

That said, without actually hearing the context of what he said, the tech situation sounds like a long term play.  Policies take a while to implement, and then conditions take a while to adjust.  Improving the US domestic tech sector will take months to years, not days to weeks."
2021-05-14 17:06:04,wallstreetbets,Your first problem was listening to Jim Cramer

*inflation and inflation would be bad for many of these high multiple*

Why is this shit even allowed on here? People in the stock market for longer than a year or two know that the President doesn't really affect things that much. Trump just took all the credit for a hot market because that's what he does. Even more importantly, this is how hypocritical and unaware of reality you are:

*Just last week, Trump tweeted, ‚ÄúThe Federal Reserve is derelict in its*   
*duties if it doesn‚Äôt lower the Rate and even, ideally, stimulate.‚Äù*

That was **before the pandemic. Stimulus and rate cuts.** If that happened, the pandemic would have set us into negative interest rates and we'd be fucked hard, although you would still sit there and blame Biden.

2021-05-14 18:15:18,wallstreetbets,"I bought Inseego two months ago at 10. One of my biggest losses. And Cramer recommended this stock 6 months ago at 20. Last year he said he is strictly against oil stocks and they were among the best performers in 2021, luckily I bought a lot of them. He was also against airline stocks one year ago and then they tripled in one month. And I once read that back in the day when he was a fund manager his performance was rather poor.

2021-05-14 18:43:51,wallstreetbets,"YOu are on the right track of being dismayed by Crame but underneath it all he's kind of givin too much credit. Sure, Biden was tagged as a guy giving cabinet positions to these big tech wigs and pegged as not being as progressive as people originally thought but that is just Dem deep state stuff. Of course they are listening to big tech and wall st and not really giving two shits about retail but you should be left to your own devices which is realizing inflation was coming and that the stimmy is just kicking can down road (implicit tax) and thinking for yourself. Pick up thepieces and move on, friend. It ain't gonna get better with so called ""experts"", which by the way have predicted it very wrong, on numerous occasiosn according to one study...way wrong."

It‚Äôs amazing this has never gained more traction and gone viral costing him his position with NBC; then again, he‚Äôs obviously a plant, and him and his cronies get together to strategize the best way to leverage his reach with the public, so to some degree he‚Äôs probably protected anyway.

My grandparents have done well in the market, mind, they never actively traded, it‚Äôs all from a lifetime of investing and holding, but, I know a lot of elderly people do watch Cramer, my grandmother included, and think he‚Äôs tits, little knowing that juicy expos√©s like this are out here on the internetz.

2021-05-14 10:55:46,wallstreetbets,Water is actually not wet. It only makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the ability of a liquid to adhere to the surface of a solid. So if you say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the surface of the object.
2021-05-14 15:49:57,wallstreetbets,"you can't chalk the whole thing up to supply chain. so many big employers all around the country are raising their minimum to $15 per hour, puts pressure on all of them to do so. and you can't discount the impact of sending out billions of dollars worth of stimulus."
2021-05-14 10:01:11,wallstreetbets,I'm not saying the guy owes anyone an apology. I'm saying be a man and admit when you previously recommended a stock and then changed your mind. Don't just tell us one day we have to buy a stock and then later on act like anyone who bought it is a damn fool.

Every one is panicking about the ""sToRm"" and my stocks are increasing in value while everything else tanks. If they actually decrease to the target, Ill start dumping more money in for the higher consistent dividend yield. Its like there is no way to lose. Problem is, I held for so long that most of the stocks that were invested have to lose 50% before I break even."

a crisis, and the spending thereafter, doesn‚Äôt seem to impact inflation rates all that much. in fact, ours was still very low until literally april. an extra $2 trillion did NOT cause that. if that were the case, the $6+ trillion in fed asset buying would have seen SOMETHING, but there‚Äôs no evidence of it.

raising minimum wages has minimal effect. the reason  prices typically rise so much is because of capitalism, not wage increase. especially with major, national and multi-national companies.

and to wrap it up, supply chain issues are the mains river behind skyrocketing prices. do you really think lumber has risen 120%+ because of INFLATION? or that home prices, gasoline, and meat prices have risen because of INFLATION? oh man, come on. you have to do some basic research here."

> Ancient, powerful creatures whose origins lie in the distant past of the cosmos, no two Great Old Ones are exactly alike, although they tend to share similar traits. Most are colossal monstrosities formed from the very fabric of the universe and virtually impossible to destroy, have minds whose thought processes are incomprehensible to humans, show little to no regard for the consequences their actions may have on lesser beings, and drive to insanity any who look upon their true form. In addition, the majority of them are able to influence the minds of sentient creatures even when sleeping or dormant. Initially believed to have been merely indifferent to the fates of those unfortunate enough to be around them, recent writings have shown the majority of them to be actively hostile to the mortal population of the cosmos.

We traders are the foolish mortal cultists who attempt to harness the power of the Great Old Ones for our own benefit. We cast spells (i.e., trade stocks) in hope of getting rich. We study arcane rituals and crazy nonsense in hopes of finding the key to power (i.e., DD). Sometimes it works, but usually it destroys us. Even when it works, we're driven insane by the sheer incomprehensibility of our alien masters."

2021-05-14 13:16:36,wallstreetbets,Right now it is null until under 410 IMO. This is the line in the sand from a TA perspective IMO. It was def more plausible when we were at 405 range since that was at the bottom support line of mid-term trend - if it would have broke 400 ish I think 380 was a PT on one of my posts. 417 is a test and then I think we see an ATH IMO but lets see.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why are red days redder for Redditors? An analytical perspective! We have all seen it. SPY drops 2% and then there is a barrage of posts and comments about how it‚Äôs due to manipulation/next recession/long-overdue correction etc. I wanted to understand what causes such extreme reactions over small drops in SPY. There might be multiple reasons as mentioned in other posts such as inexperienced investors/lesser time in the market/volatile portfolio. While the first two cannot be proven analytically, we can definitely verify the volatile portfolio concept.

For this, first, we have to understand Beta. Put simply, Beta is the measure of the volatility of a stock in relation to the overall market. If we consider SPY as the benchmark, Beta of SPY would be 1. A high-risk tech company with a Beta of 1.75 would be more volatile than the market. I.e., if SPY returns 10% in one week, the company is expected to return 17.5% (75% more than SPY). But, this works both ways. If SPY drops 10%, the stock will drop 17.5%. Herein lies the problem.

Here is the list of most discussed stocks last month, along with their Beta values.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/dr0pfv2j03z61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aa1e53e426ef4cdd8a9b173e95776df015a83cb)

As you can see, almost all of the popular stocks in social media have extreme volatility. For e.g., PLTR has a Beta of 9.6! This means that the stock will drop a whopping 9.6% for every 1% drop in the market.

For analysis purposes, I am creating an equally distributed portfolio of these 9 stocks (Coinbase is not considered as it has not been trading long enough to calculate Beta). **The average Beta of this portfolio is 3.14!**

This implies that if SPY drops a mere 3% your portfolio would be down 9.3%. This value would be even higher in case you have a portfolio that is skewed towards CLOV or PLTR. What‚Äôs ironic here is that GME with its negative Beta can act as a hedge against red days!

**Limitations of the analysis:** One of the major assumptions with the analysis is that people who talk about stocks probably own that stock which might not be the case. Also, this analysis might not hold for future patterns since Beta accounts only for historical data and cannot predict where the market will go. Finally, the data is taken from nasdaq.com (as of 2nd May) and they haven‚Äôt exactly disclosed the time period or the benchmark they use for Beta calculation.

**Conclusion:**

As we can prove from the analysis, we significantly underestimate the overall risk we are taking by adding popular stocks to our portfolio. The phenomenal gains we see on good days can easily be taken away on red days which explains the overreaction. In other words,

*‚Äúwhat Beta giveth, Beta taketh away!‚Äù*"

Sup, honorable apecitizens! Recently I‚Äôve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche‚Äôs market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking‚Äôs takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen‚Äôs preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

‚Äî A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn‚Äôt pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let‚Äôs take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement üåàtool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal üåà grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly ‚Äúis become meme, Destroyer of shorts‚Äù: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company‚Äôs shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla‚Äôs business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla‚Äôs opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I‚Äôve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk‚Äôs disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ‚òùÔ∏è is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see.

**TL;DR** is in the comments.

Citadel manages over $300 billion I believe He‚Äôs worth $30 billion and Citadel makes $6 billion a year. GME is worth $11 billion.

2021-05-14 10:25:56,wallstreetbets,"Yes the charts and technicals may add up but sentiment and fundamentals also provided the necessary fuel to the rocket for VW and TSLA to moon. 
VW literally 75% of float disappeared in a few weeks with the shareholder publicly stating they would not sell. 
TSLA turned a profit and all the environmental legislation fucking guarantees they will continue to have growing demand. Oh and literally like every other auto maker is a potential customer for batteries. 
GME was illegally shorted into oblivion, and was actually suffering from a business stand point. Now they have started to turn it around but there is more uncertainty around gme then tsla. Isk how people can compare gme to vw cuz the situations are just so different.

Idk man more power to you but like this is such unique situation with so many external factors ( and as we saw in jan a shit load of risk ) that its hard to determine if there will be another run up at all. I would love to see GME break 1k, who wouldnt( hehe oh kenny ) its just crazy how pervasive this single stonk has become"

25% of shares of GME are short. That‚Äôs $2.7 billion. Yet the hedge fund industry which manages $2 trillion and makes most of its money being long is going to put all of their assets on the line (if it moons to infinity that is the argument)  to get that $2 billion in profit (less than 1/10th of 1% of assets). They know WSB hates them but let‚Äôs take a step back and see how this makes sense from a hedge fund perspective. ."

The longs could have named their price and the shorts would have had to pay it. Porsche settled their options early because they were trying to do a hostile takeover of VW, so they needed the squeeze to end so they could buy even more.  If it had been millions of retail apes that were long rather than 1 big competitor, the VW squeeze would have played out for much longer, and gone much higher.  Now imagine if the **bare minimum** short interest was 200% and you start to get a picture of GME."
2021-05-14 14:28:00,wallstreetbets,">	It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out.

If this is true for GME, then what is the worst case outcome for the short sellers? What does the burning building actually look like? Are they going to lose money on a bad trade, or are they going to jail?"

Now it's just a memesub full of ppl treating the stock market as a casino and feel smart. I work at a fund and been studying the market for almost 10 years and this dude tells me I just don't get his dumpsterfire of a shitpost"
2021-05-14 18:34:38,wallstreetbets,"What info do you have that supports that it already happened, besides a jump in price?  

His TA shows the info that supports that fact that both VW and TSLA rose significantly before the actual squeeze. Squeezes don't happen in a day when they are this huge. Considering everything about GME is larger than both VW and TSLA in terms of how many shorts and what's at stake, it makes sense that this would be far longer drawn out, with more pronounced stages than anything ever seen before. 

There have been plenty of boomer articles (which I'm sure you read like a playboy magazine jerking off to Dow movements), and DD on how the initial run up was not shorts covering, but actual interest in the stock. 

Do you really believe that shorts would have to buy up 140% of the float, so ALL of the float plus an additional 40%, while also competing with literal millions of people in the world to buy up the stock, and you think they managed that? Not impossible, but would be very impressive. 

Now I'm sounding like a crazy ape..."

you all really think you gonna be millionaires when gme goes to $5000 ? there is no melvin capital to fund this escapade anymore, you all just gonna gouge each others eyes out trying to float this pig, the only people who will get rich off this is the brokers and HFTs, skimming money off all your trades"

2021-05-14 17:06:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that super fucking annoyed me. I would love to revive this subs culture, but GME isn't it. That's what ruined this subs culture, pushed out a lot of vets and completely changed the vibe of this place. It's hard to even get good information here because the apes all upvote each others retarded ass ideas. It's a bunch of new retards who barely understand options giving investing advice to a bunch of other retards now."
2021-05-14 18:44:28,wallstreetbets,"You have to understand, GME started here. This place is the birthplace of the gme movement, so for good or for bad these two things are inextricably linked and cannot be separated. 

This place created a monster and there's no denying that. Having this place spam with gme posts can get annoying, they have other subs for that. But here is where it all started so to turn your back on it totally is just gatekeeping. Just don't open the thread if you don't want to, fuck off."

2021-05-14 13:48:03,wallstreetbets,"That guy better be hiding about now.  Given the tweets GME been putting out, and the pics Cohen's been taking awfully close to yesterdays closed-door SEC meeting, methinks even the first day or two of tallying votes was enough to put them over the float."
2021-05-14 15:44:20,wallstreetbets,"I mean, what are the odds? Is it a slim too non chance or is it possible?"

2021-05-14 19:32:51,wallstreetbets,">So if there is more votes than shares

You are confusing the float with the total number of outstanding shares.  The float does not include closely held shares, or restricted shares - but these shares can still be legally voted."

2021-05-14 13:16:06,wallstreetbets,I can see that.    I do agree with the other people responding that the bigger issue is he seems to be capping this at a few 1000...when we all know he left of 3 or 4 zeros.

2021-05-14 14:58:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that comes from his comparison with the VW squeeze. But he neglects that this one ended with Porsche letting short sellers off the hook.

2021-05-14 16:10:42,wallstreetbets,"Finviz, Ortex, Fintel etc all show less than 30% short interest. So yes, I am sure about that.

The only potential for the mother of all squeezes was when it was around 140%. It will never get that close again and any hope of that squeeze still happening at this point is just delusion. 30% interest is still pretty significant and i‚Äôm sure it will remain somewhat volatile but the dream has been over for a while."
2021-05-14 14:41:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah its hard to tell when finra is hiding data. But it must be sky high after months of rabid shorting.

2021-05-14 17:13:40,wallstreetbets,"Data from the world‚Äôs top financial analysis companies is not an opinion.

No where in this article does it say Tesla is getting into biogas. It says that Tesla is looking to sell clean energy credits to this market.

Tesla isn‚Äôt getting into gas cars or anything like that. Tesla is going to continue pursuing the market of selling its clean energy credits.

Nothing is changing other than who can buy the energy credits."

2021-05-14 14:10:59,wallstreetbets,"That is not at all what the article says.

Currently there are some entities generating electricity with biogas, and they sell those clean energy credits. Tesla wants to be able to sell clean energy credits in that market. The article then mentions how some farmers (who use biogas to generate electricity) are mad at that proposal because it would appear that the Biden administration would be prioritizing Tesla over people who _actually_ use biogas.

Tesla is not getting into the business of biogas. It only wants to sell credits to that market."

2021-05-14 06:37:22,wallstreetbets,"Futures are continuing their rally, with tech stocks leading the way. The Nasdaq is up 1.1%. Russell 2000 0.7% higher. S&P 500 0.6% to the good and Dow Industrials ahead by 0.4%. That‚Äôs as of 0625.

This follows a day of nice gains for risk assets. There was a reversal after some pre-market selling. At the close the major indexes were up 1% and change (except for the Nasdaq, which gained only 0.7%).

No immediate indication what‚Äôs driving the relief rally, but I have my ideas. You have to listen to the podcast though. Not gonna type it.

Stocks have a bunch of ground to make up to turn green for the week. Nasdaq is still down 4.6% for the week. S&P almost 3% in the red. Dow down 2%. 

Couple of data releases today. Retail sales at 0830. Expectation is for a 0.8% increase in April, a major slowdown from the 9.8% advance in March. Industrial production at 0915 will shed some light on supply-chain bottlenecks. 

If those reports beat estimates we should see more buying, though probably not quite enough to turn us green for the week."

Stay hydrated - whisky is best here, but if before noon where you are, consider a healthier clear spirit like vodka or pure grain alcohol.

Eat a nutritious and balanced breakfast - make sure to include all five major crayon colours, and plenty of tendies for protein. Bananas are acceptable.

Perform one act of kindness - make your wife‚Äôs boyfriend a cup of coffee to start his day right - he‚Äôs probably very tired.

Do some mindfulness mantras - chanting a mantra over and over again can be very helpful in keeping the mind calm. A few suggestions include; ‚ÄòHoly Moly‚Äô, ‚ÄòI like the stock‚Äô, or ‚ÄòTo the moon‚Äô.

Take some time away from your computer screen - in this day and age, sitting for too long in front of your computer can be very taxing. Be good to yourself, and occasionally switch to staring at your phone screen instead.

Good luck out there today, retards."

2021-05-14 13:41:08,wallstreetbets,"Posting this again...

For everyone thinking about buying AMC:

**It is ten times 2016 market cap levels,** 

It won't see ""2019"" revenue until 20**23**,

*It still has debt*, no new innovation, no new tech, no advertising, no marketing, no acquisitions, no mergers, no change in leadership, no opening new theatres, no renovating existing theatres.

People demographically in the USA have become **less and less interested in movie theatres for the last 10 years**. We are about *to potentially enter another economic downturn because of gigainflation*. Cinemas don't do well when the poors have no money.

People were opening short positions at 30, 25, 20, 15 and 10 - they will need AMC to be in the 150-200 range to even begin margin calls... and either way they can *justify to their lender* that they don't have to cover. Why? BECAUSE THE STOCK IS **FUNDAMENTALLY OVERVALUED**.

Institutions can *negotiate their covenants with the lenders*. They do **not have to cover.**

If AMC wanted a squeeze, they'd have issued something to force shorts to cover. Like a dividend... or split or anything.

Instead, they have *only done everything to help shorts cover by diluting the stock*. $1,000,000,000 has been raised by AMC through stock dilutions. What has that been used for? To prevent *bankruptcy*. That isn't bullish. They *still have debt*.

Who do you think was initiating those buys yesterday? Did retail suddenly all decide in unison that yesterday was the day to go all in?

**Absolutely not.** It was sparked by an institution. Conveniently we see AMC dilute the stock *on the same day*.

AMü§°s have ***WAY*** too much faith in this company.

WAY too much man."

BABA at $260 its surely a steal theres no way it could go any lower, its rated a buy from value investors like charlie munger and growth investors like cathie woods and has a 30% upsideü§°

BABA at $229 once the anti trust judgement comes through from the CCP as long as they dont break apart the company the stock has to do wellü§°

BABA at $240 see i was right ill average up on shares now thats its only recieved a $2.8 billion dollar fine and the company isnt broken upü§°

BABA at $220 WOW BABA is really undervalued before earnings, let me grab some calls, the miss on eps should be fine since they were fined $2.8 billion and that should be priced in but i expect growth in its cloud sector, robotics, goods and service and total revenue to beat so it should just be easy moneyü§°

BABA at $206 Well im out of money to average down but it cant get any lower, its the biggest tech  company in the only country that has had a positive GDP during covid, on top of that china has a population of 1.4 billion so theres even more growth to be hadü§°

BABA at $170 well BABA now has a p/e of some oil companies and thats a dying sector yet BABA has insane growth in different areas and using all their profits to reinvest in their company and innovateü§°

BABA has been delisted on the US stock exchange and my shares are nearly worthless, its fine im sure China will take over the world and my shares of BABA will grant me nobility in the new world orderü§°"

I‚Äôm super happy I followed my gut on this and didn‚Äôt let this one go. Even my risky June options look like they will turn out just Fine. Not sure if it‚Äôs too late to hop on the ride though.
Also hoping that this thing has been shorted excessively, which is likely as it‚Äôs been just going down hill."

2021-05-14 07:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Everyone thinking about buying AMC:

**It is over triple 2016 market cap levels,** 

It won't see ""2019"" revenue until 20**23**,

*It still has debt*, no new innovation, no new tech, no advertising, no marketing, no acquisitions, no mergers, no change in leadership, no opening new theatres, no renovating existing theatres.

People demographically in the USA have become **less and less interested in movie theatres for the last 10 years**. We are about *to potentially enter another economic downturn because of gigainflation*. Cinemas don't do well when the poors have no money.

People were opening short positions at 30, 25, 20, 15 and 10 - they will need AMC to be in the 150-200 range to even begin margin calls... and either way they can *justify to their lender* that they don't have to cover. Why? BECAUSE THE STOCK IS **FUNDAMENTALLY OVERVALUED**.

Institutions can *negotiate their covenants with the lenders*. They do **not have to cover.**

If AMC wanted a squeeze, they'd have issued something to force shorts to cover. Like a dividend... or split or anything.

Instead, they have *only done everything to help shorts cover by diluting the stock*. $1,000,000,000 has been raised by AMC through stock dilutions. What has that been used for? To prevent *bankruptcy*. That isn't bullish. 

Who do you think was initiating those buys yesterday? Did retail suddenly all decide in unison that yesterday was the day to go all in?

**Absolutely not.** It was sparked by an institution. Conveniently we see AMC dilute the stock *on the same day*.

AMü§°s have ***WAY*** too much faith in this company.

WAY too much man."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"All you guys talk about is GME/AMC While ignoring the brewing short squeeze in $lmnd (currently &gt;30% SI). Stock could be set up for a major bounce due to being heavily oversold (down some 60-70% since highs in Jan).

Citron Research (Andrew Left) came up with a lame short report yesterday after shorting it down 20% the prior day, only for it to blow up in his face &amp; the stock running +7% yesterday, leaving them miserably unable to cover the short. Citron Research desperately followed up with 2 more tweets intraday, but management immediately clapped back directly on twitter, and the stock rallied further. 

It‚Äôs interesting to note that 6x the daily average volume was traded on Wednesday, where it fell -20% despite an excellent earnings print. This could possibly be multiple hedge funds collabing behind this short.

Andrew Left said his firm will stop ‚Äúactivist short selling‚Äù after the GME blow up, only to go back on his words a few months later. What‚Äôs worse, he‚Äôs shorting a charitable public benefit corp in Lemonade Inc.

This is a $3.5B mkt. cap stock with $1.2B in cash and no debt‚Ä¶ Being shorted as if they‚Äôre headed for eminent bankruptcy. A 89% YoY growth beast is literally being traded at close to it‚Äôs book value/share. That‚Äôs insane.

TLDR: let the Lemonade squeeze begin üçã. Jan2023 $200c üöÄ



*EDIT:

Jesus I am shocked that all logic and arguments I‚Äôve put forth are literally being ignored by many here in the comments just because my account was registered 2 months ago? How shallow minded. Consider this post taken down; I am no longer responding to your arbitrary comments that make zero reference to the content I‚Äôve written. This was supposed to be a fun DD but instead all I‚Äôve gotten were insults (not even funny type of insults, just nasty insults.)

Thank you WSB for showing me how valued critical thinking is among this community (clearly not a lot). Nothing personal, I wish you all well. Just clearly not the place for intellectual discussions as I initially thought. I‚Äôll fuck off to somewhere other than here to discuss investing ideas.

According to Statista,  **Luxury apparel market value worldwide** will reach 84.04 billion U.S. dollars by 2025. ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/941156/luxury-apparels-market-value-worldwide/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/941156/luxury-apparels-market-value-worldwide/))

$FTCH, or Farfetch, basically has a monopoly on the segment, with exponential revenues and a stable path to profitability. EBITDA was positive in 2020 end. 

Check the earnings for yesterday: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/farfetch-limited-ftch-reports-q1-214509242.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/farfetch-limited-ftch-reports-q1-214509242.html) \- 4 conclusions: exponential growth, path to profits, backed by giants, incredible product.

Additionally, the biggest market worldwide and by far the least exploited is CHINA. Farfetch is already dominant on the market with a **HUGE partnership with Alibaba**, the joint partnership with Tmall (basically the biggest luxury marketplace in **China, that $FTCH now rules**). 

Backed by major hedge funds, the stock price took a **GIGANTIC HIT with the ARCHEGOS scandal,** leading the stock price to a gigantic undervaluation (price targets reach as high as 120$, while current price is 38$). 

Combine this with the recent downfall in growth stocks due to inflation concerns, and we have an enourmous BULL thesis here. 

Per my analysis, the stock price should **triple in price by 2021 end.**

Prepare yourselves apes, cause summer is coming!

 **How did Floyd Mayweather become such a legendary boxer?**

He understood the human behaviors of his adversary.

Repeatable sequences his opponents like to throw, over and over. He observed and learned.

He was then able to anticipate and get that edge we are all looking for!

**The same approach  with the  charting .**

Check out the identified structures. Amplitude and length doesn't have to be the same, but the pattern. Then observe the subsequent moves in silver price once those patterns completed!

Silver's open interest (including options) MACD shows an insane setup for silver.

Question is... how high? Greedy analog move yields 73$ in Q4 2021.

You must understand the HUGE tidal wave in motion that will sky rocket silver prices.

This is the M2 money supply vs gold. Currently gold is waiting for the latest explosion in M2 to unwind as it let's the 12 month moving average catch up.

&#x200B;

Take away for this chart is the time bomb... Tic Toc....

 Okay, this is THE chart you guys wanna see.  Well, same as it's big brother gold... it has a +900% move baked in the cake. From a silver price of around 27$, that brings it up in excess of 200$ for 3 years period .  This is life-changing money if played right. 

 Now, here is the actual picture. WTF?!?! Pretty insane M1 money supply expansion. That is fuel for silverto climb up. Like some folks say, it's gonna need a rocket ship now to catch up.

As said  at the begining Silver is about to explode if we  are in or not .   !!!( This not financial advice do always you dd before any investment decision ) Don't forget I'am an ape like you not a financial adviser...

2021-05-14 10:47:24,wallstreetbets,"There are two elements driving the case of the silver squeeze.  


1.) This charting explains why silver is massively undervalued relative to M1 and how much it's held down despite rising industrial demand and massive retail demand.  


2.) The other factor is banks have short positions at 92% of the annual global supply.  These banks can't unwind their position easily. They did this while M1 was blowing up and were not paying attention.  


Other DD over on WSS yesterday indicates that COMEX may have run out of silver in the last week. Record outflows from the exchanges abruptly shifted to a net of 19 contracts out of the vault. LBMA admitted overstating their holdings by 3,300 tonnes. Data shows deliveries are drying last week. You can't deliver silver you don't have. üî•üèõÔ∏èüî•

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$DASH - Is it overvalued? DASH reported yesterday their Q1 results.

Revenue was 1.08B vs 995.65M as expected, but the loss was 0.34 vs 0.10 expected.

Their gross order volume was 9.9B... BUT, the company is forecasting 35-38B in orders for the year... so no growth, perhaps a decline (well if they are forecasting no growth and possibly a decline, it will likely be much worse) and they lost money this quarter... They are forecasting EBITDA (which Warren Buffet hates as you ignore your worst cost, depreciation, per him) for the year of 0-300M, so let's say it will be $0 or less.

So to recap a company with a market cap at closing ($115 sp) of 37B in a year like this, when delivery of food took off, will not make any money... The rest of the year they don't expect to grow or make money, but somehow people think in a competitive landscape this company will go on to grow and be very profitable one day?

What the heck am I missing? I am not selling my Puts, this company makes no sense. When lockup expires (I think in June), that will help people realize the idiocy of this. I would really love to hear the bull case given the Q1 numbers to understand why I am wrong.

Positions 30X 8/21 $100P. Cost was $5.5, price at closing was $9.75. I assume with the uptick after hours they will be way down in value."

Grub has a high cap for being a shit service shit stock already peaked and not bringing in much $$$

I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kladql/dash_vs_grub/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) on it months ago 

Dash also has corporate deals now Macy‚Äôs, gme, covid test distribution, Walmart, vons to name a few 
My bull case focused on dash gaining market share in good side buying out grub and maybe Uber eats and new corporate deals making certain places exclusive delivery from dash such as the names listed above but also popular fast food like chick fil A which gets priority on orders and sets a precedent for future deals such as Taco Bell McDonald‚Äôs

I think DASH is overvalued puts are the way but it will come out on top of food delivery apps so keep its valuation in comparison to GRUB ( closest competitor since Uber has other revenue)"

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/americans-fear-highest-inflation-in-nearly-a-decade.html

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/13/top-bank-of-england-economist-warns-of-1970s-style-price-inflation

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/upshot/inflation-is-here-what-now.html

*Idea*: I believe inflation will be short lived and we will revert to a deflationary environment in less than two years. Briefly, the rationale behind that is (1) stimulus checks/helicopter money programs will end, (2) the supply chain will go back to full capacity and demand will be met by offer, (3) no countries have implemented long standing relief programs, (4) demographics are going down and labor cost is going up, (5) globalization is increasing competition between companies, keeping prices down, (6) technological advancements push prices down.

You can agree or disagree with such an idea, but we are not here to assess whether I‚Äôm a moron or not.


*Question*: how do I bet on deflation? The idea I had was to take the short side of some of the inflation assets, but a short play is not sustainable for a retail investor on the long term due to daily fees. 

So, how do I play deflation?"
2021-05-14 03:31:03,wallstreetbets,"Since you can't afford shorting or floating rate swaps, why dont you do the opposite of what inflation believers would do? Tech companies usually do terrible during higher inflation times but pretty good during lower times, hypothetically, they trade on discount during high inflation, that means you can buy and hold for 2 years without any real fees. Also, empirically, growth companies trade on discount as well. I would personally disagree on that, because I believe that growth companies have increased their corporate savings in excess and we cant compare them with past data anymore, but history so far disagrees on me. We will see. Basically, if you want to play  2 years in advance, look around what ppl sell right now to hedge against inflation and buy them cheaper. This is not financial advice, just my opinion, but if you become rich out of I'd appreciate a free drink."
2021-05-14 02:58:59,wallstreetbets,"""Cash is not only the ultimate hedge, but also the only investment that rises in value during deflation. As stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities are all losing value, the amount of cash required to purchase these assets is falling, by definition. In other words, the relative value of cash is going up."" - some google search"

2021-05-14 04:41:59,wallstreetbets,Trade currency on the FX market. You can trade for the US dollar against the Japanese Yen. The Japanese central bank is known for trying to keep inflation near 0%.
2021-05-14 07:52:14,wallstreetbets,There are also TIPS. (Kinda worthless if you ask me)
2021-05-14 07:58:38,wallstreetbets,Kathy Wood thinks the same and Michael Burry thinks you both are getting it wrong!
2021-05-14 02:57:04,wallstreetbets,"I also disagree, but if you‚Äôre betting against inflation and for deflation, I would say your best bet would be to buy bearish etfs such as SQQQ"
2021-05-14 02:54:04,wallstreetbets,"I'd argue with Number 5, if you haven't noticed yet, major companies like P&G, Coca Cola and others announced they will slowly raise their prices this year.

2021-05-14 08:28:32,wallstreetbets,"You could be right, however why would you want to make a 2 year play when 4 6 month plays can yield better results? It‚Äôs not about reality. It‚Äôs about the narrative. As retail investors, our edge comes from agility. We can move in and out of trades without moving the market. Regardless of what you believe, play the narrative in the short term.

Or if you are a glutton for punishment and want to make a 2 year trade, buy leap puts on commodity indexes."
2021-05-14 08:49:09,wallstreetbets,you are confusing a deflationary environment with a disinflationary environment.
2021-05-14 09:35:59,wallstreetbets,"I believe inflation is here to stay, because the money printed might actually be in the hands of people willing to spend it, and they will bid up costs at any rate until either their money is gone, or not worth what it was. Maybe the only thing that could cause deflation in the short term is a mass hoarding of cash by people who won't spend it, I.E. the wealthy or the government?"
2021-05-14 10:09:08,wallstreetbets,"You would buy bonds, debt gets more expensive during a deflationary period."

2021-05-14 03:02:09,wallstreetbets,Buy low so you can sell high
2021-05-14 03:43:54,wallstreetbets,"More than that, I think that company debt is havier during deflation. Every dollar borrowed today is worth more tomorrow"
2021-05-14 03:04:19,wallstreetbets,"Sure - only problem is that you need to have *heaps* of cash to play like that. Which I don‚Äôt have.

So, I need a trade, namely a mechanism through which I can invest my money and turn them into more money by betting on deflation."

Edit: if you think this is wrong, explain your opinion, don‚Äôt just downvote like a pussy"
2021-05-14 03:02:28,wallstreetbets,"To my knowledge, you should short commodities , they have already risen significantly, so assuming you're right prices may go down"
2021-05-14 03:08:31,wallstreetbets,Got that - but why SQQQ specifically? QQQ is specific to the tech market. Do you believe deflation strikes harder tech stocks than other stocks?
2021-05-14 03:06:16,wallstreetbets,"As said in the main post : a retail investor cannot maintain a short position for long periods of time, because of daily fees. So, a short position is out of the picture..."
2021-05-14 03:13:45,wallstreetbets,"It was just the first bearish etf that popped into my smooth brain, but I do think a deflationary period would result in a shift away from high growth stocks such as tech stocks moreso than value stocks, even though the market as a whole would have a downturn."
2021-05-14 15:50:24,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this guys analysis is smooth brain. SQQQ is a great way to lose all your money. We've had low inflation for like 2 decades and QQQ has been absolutely crushing it. Right now, SQQQ has been up a bit because inflation worries have spooked investors away from tech plays"

I think the theater industry will still be alive but will considerably shrink. There just isn‚Äôt the demand for it even with pent up energy. It will spike and fizzle out very quickly.

2021-05-14 01:10:10,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd have to agree. I love going to the movies but AMC‚Äôs current business model has no way to grow. They were struggling pre-Covid and even as they open back up it will be limited capacity. Then selling shares is the only chance they have to stay afloat, but for how long?

Imagine renting out a theater for a couple hours with friends and playing on the big screen, or tournaments and etc."
2021-05-14 01:28:40,wallstreetbets,Yea. Because the borrowed MORE money..not because they MADE money. That‚Äôs like having a credit card with a very high limit and no job to pay off the CC bill with. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2021-05-14 09:18:45,wallstreetbets,"Could you recreate the exp at home? Probably ya depending on your budget, but the fact that theaters can still show older movies that do surprisingly well, some movies being better in theaters, the current back catalog of movies coming out in the next year and I think the future looks bright.

2021-05-14 12:52:04,wallstreetbets,Pre-Covid they were filling the theater at anywhere from $10 - $20 a seat. But Concessions generate most of their profit anyway. Which I find would be difficult to expand upon. Also I know of a lot of AMC‚Äôs that were already serving alcohol. I used to do insurance work for them and love the company. But their business model still needs to change if they expect to grow.

In this the short seller allegations against Clover Many say it has the potential to 2x in the next few weeks, but does it? Is Clover Health Stock still a Buy?! Clover's high membership growth, short seller Hindenburg's accusations, the competition with United Health (UNH), the opportunity in the online health industry,  Clover uses a software, named clover assistance, that improves every interaction at the point of care with machine learning. Physicians currently use clover assistants to help them deliver better care to patients, which gives better outcomes to patients and physicians as well. The company currently manages Medicare advantage plans and receives roughly $10,000 in annual revenue per patient. 

Few weeks ago, Hindenburg, the famous short seller, accused Chamath, the ‚Äúking of spacs‚Äù, of luring retail investors through CLOV. This instantly caused the stock to drop. We saw a pop when Clover and Chamath responded to this attack. CLOV took this attack in an opportunity to make investors know them better. Between both CLOV and Chamath, they responded to the claims point by point and even provided more information. Altogether, it shows that Clover has nothing to hide. Chamath is known for finding growth opportunities and has helped many great companies go public such as Virgin Galactic. Chamath has a reputation to keep up so I don‚Äôt think we would jeopardize that with a bad investment. This is not a DD do your own and this is straight up plagiarized information.

This is one of a few tech diamonds in the dirt right now. Mainly because they are growing faster than other tech companies while having a pristine balance sheet and very low P/S valuation. I challenge you to find another 3B annual revenue company that has better metrics in those 3 categories. EV is just ridiculously low when you consider 1.6B in cash and no debt.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Rackspace DD - The fact is that Facebook also had a $3.8B market cap once Extending on some guys RXT due diligence post the other day, my investment thesis goes something like this:

We are a large, profitable tech company, that does not currently have a tech value multiple (in fact it is cheap compared to pretty much any business). We also have a cost of production which is among the lowest of any in our industry.

An opportunity with such apparent strength and uniqueness needs analysis and understanding as to why it has been overlooked thus far.

Imo firstly, COP is lower than Silicon Valley because of our location. 

Secondly, this opportunity has not been recognised yet, because the company is not based in Silicon Valley, where the usual tech investors and tech marketing is. This investor oversight may be a combination of home-town bias, the biologically limited attentional capacity of people, and the overwhelming press focus on the front-end tech businesses. 

Location is actually not a relevant constraint on the potential of the business, because software is a product that does not require shipping."

2021-05-13 23:26:09,wallstreetbets,"I haven‚Äôt followed the previous discussion but I assume the global chip shortage will affect them. With customers having trouble sourcing hardware they might turn to private cloud offerings like that from RXT. That would be great for them (and other similar hosting providers), but what happens if RXT runs out of hardware? We are seeing lead times reaching one year for some rather common equipment.
Contrary to your statement location is a concern: round trip times for cloud applications are important. Not for all, though. Similarly regulatory concerns (E.g GDPR) are important and outright prevent some customers from consuming any of the services, even when hosted in Europe."
2021-05-14 00:06:25,wallstreetbets,"Did you even look at their financials? They are massively overleveraged after they got the ol' private equity treatment. They are a couple bad quarters from going tits up. Their business also relies on inefficiencies that currently exist between different web based cloud services. If one or more of those services changes their offerings or services slightly it could make rackspace no longer able to add value for customers.

If they do succeed, the extremely high leverage will mean you get an outsized payout, but it's such a massive if and in a business where they don't really control their own fate. There's a reason their price is this low, and it's not their location."

Those three companies have massive datacenters for their own internal needs that they also use for hosting, whereas Rackspace is pretty much all hosting. It seems near inconceivable for Rackspace to compete in building the infrastructure.

In fact, prior to COVID it seems Rackspace was barely growing and if anything was perhaps in decline. COVID gave them a boost, but I would expect the longer-term trend to continue which is not good for them. I just don't see any real reason why to be bullish on them."

What is this DD in any case... Not having a tech valuation (whatever is meant by that) is not a good thing, it possibly means investors think your company is junk. As to their cost of production being from the lowest, no clue what is meant by that as their financials seem to say another story."

That being said, i considered buying far OTM put LEAPS on TSLA. Didn't go trough with it because i'm better than that, but i mean, they would be 99% free money. TSLA was a slow short squeeze that then gained traction and kept going due to a pretty massive snowball effect, that's it. Nothing new, just the market doing market things."

A reminder that you can slowly liquidate a losing stock to negative gear and offset capital gains tax for the fin year you bought it AND the next

Eg: Sell a long held stock this fin year, sale income is a capital gain.

Buy another thing you plan to hold for a year.

Fucked up and bought something that shit the bed? Sell half of it to reduce capital gains made from the winning sale made this fin year. Sell the other half to reduce capital gains tax made on the other winning trade next fin year.

Let's you take an L and use it to pay less tax on your W's"

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Boeing Airlines as a Potential Hedge against Inflation According to the Q1 earning report ‚ÄúThe plane manufacturer reported a net loss of $561 million for the first three months of 2021 on revenue of $15.2 billion‚Äù. 

 $318 million dollars of this loss was related to a ‚Äú318 million pretax charge related to issues with a supplier for the modified 747 planes used as Air Force One,‚Äù after a contractor tasked with building the interior failed to meet its contractual obligations‚Äîhighlighting  logistical and supply bottlenecks in the production process: Boeing has filed a suit in court alleging losses: and still remains committed to fulfilling the contract on time.

Finally Boeing ended The first quarter with $63.6 billion in total debt, unchanged from the previous quarter (more on this debt later and how 30b in bonds sold last year is all of a sudden looking smart).

Despite what was a poor 1q earnings report for Boeing,the bright side about Boeing‚Äôs situation ‚Äîgiven the current market environment of rising commodity and production costs‚Äî is that at least they have plenty of Already Made, ready to go Airplanes --they will go up in value due to inflation ---: , currently the 737 Max models sell for around  100-120 million.

Given a modest, conservative rise in inflation: these planes are likely to go up at least 2 million a piece. Now if Boeing can just manage to sell the rest of these planes ‚Äî- The current backlog is aprox 4,700‚Äì and selling them at current prices: and not taking into account inflation or price increases Boeing can walk away from this not only clearing its debt but with 40 billion in pure profit after expenses.


Boeing expects to clear the backlog by the end of this year: but even if they don‚Äôt that could end up being a good thing for Boeing airlines as they watch their inventory of commercial jetliners appreciate due to inflation. 

In any case, while some tech stocks are going to need more and more money to grow, the BA 30billion war chest should be sufficient to get them through 2022. 

And the day they turn that debt into profit is the day Boeing shoots right up to $300 ‚Äîcould happen by q1 next year. And after it breaks $300 all bets are off: who knows how big it could get: maybe it ends up being the winner in the emerging space industry , maybe another war pops off in the Middle East and defense / military revenue grows even more: this could be a 6-800$+ stock one day... 


So what do you think Wall Street bets is Boeing airlines a smart hedge for rising inflation?"

2021-05-14 04:44:24,wallstreetbets,"First of all Boeing is not an airline! Couldn't get past that, so nothing else you typed matters."
2021-05-14 02:55:27,wallstreetbets,"Sigh.  This is not how airplane sales work.  Airlines get discounts off the asking price ‚Äî can be up to 50%.  The Southwest order likely had that level of discount.  The 737 Max will not go automatically go up with inflation; orders were cancelled as more news came out about the planning and production.

Your entire premise is flawed as you assume the planes sell for list price.  They do not."

2021-05-14 00:13:50,wallstreetbets,I haven't really followed Boeing too closely in a while. I got out a couple of years ago at about $400/share. It's a good company with really only 1 big competitor. I think there's still a lot of room to move up in price now that the 737 fiasco and pandemic aren't having as big an impact.

2021-05-14 01:13:16,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you call it ‚ÄúBoeing Airlines‚Äù despite the first line of the quoted report describing it correctly as a ‚Äúplane manufacturer‚Äù tells me everything we need to know about how solid this  DD is.

Also, the backlog is of planes that are already sold in the most part (and the ones that are not sold are cancelled orders). So there is no way those planes are worth 100 million each, especially because you did not account for discounting. 

I would not touch Boeing stock no matter what pretty numbers they throw out in the earnings or their spin."

Military contracts: Good!

New products blow away competition: Good!

New products grounded/delayed: BAD

Current electronics supply chain probs: BAD

I cheer for Boeing but the unpredictability and constant surprise hurdles make it too hard for me personally to dump money into. Maybe a good long-term investment but with the push for more economical competing products (‚Äúhyper loop‚Äù dreams and mag train networks to connect major cities) and competitors like Airbus and Lockheed Martin making strides while they stall reminds me of Intel Vs AMD over the last 5 years.

2021-05-13 22:47:05,wallstreetbets,"Airlines are volatile. No doubt. But Boeing has very little competition across many programs, not just commercial airplanes. Military contracts are often 20~40 year commitments even though it‚Äôs having a tough time on the commercial side, their defense group is still profitable.

I invested in them at the peak and then doubled down and re-doubled and re-doubled again when the stock was taking a dive. My high price was around $245 and low price was around $140, and it‚Äôs $222 at the moment.

I do expect it to clear $300 easily, possibly $400 in the next five to ten years. So it‚Äôs a long hold for me."

I‚Äôve talked with them on the phone twice to explain my account balance because if you‚Äôre trading (on margin)frequently and withdrawing/depositing weekly, you need a damn accountant to figure out how much money you actually have to buy stocks."

Fisker is a long position. They will be bringing an EV to market for less than $30,000, which will make the vehicle accessible to damn near anybody. The deal with Foxconn will allow Fisker to take a vehicle from concept to production within 1 year. Nothing about the fundamentals have changed...and the next bump will be when the company announces where the car will be manufactured (hopefully Wisconsin).  


Seriously. People wetting their pants over a stock underperforming before the product is even launched is laughable.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Palantir, how to build a theoretically perfect business, the possible incoming golden age of America, and why you shouldn't feel stupid for buying the dip. by now you all should be sick to death of hearing about Palantir. shit stock, hype company, everyone knows this already. most of you barely understand what they do. some of you do understand, and root for the potential of the birth of yet another trillion dollar company, but that's not what I'm going to talk about. There is an aspect to all this that I have not yet seen discussed anywhere, and as soon as people figure it out, I suspect Palantir will see activity beyond anything anyone right now has predicted. 

Lets start by asking a question. If you had to create a company that was perfect in every way, that was untouchable by competition and greater than any company before it, one that would make google or amazon look like AMC by comparison, what would you need to do?

first it would need to be a monopoly. no question there right? but a monopoly of what? There are currently 2 options that fit best and are also realistically achievable. those to things are information and energy. both will always exist, they will always be in high demand, they will never go out of style, and whoever finds a way to gain absolute control over one or both will effectively become the most wealthy person ever. 100 thousand years from now when humanity has transcended existence and all material wants we will still need information and energy. Palantir is attempting to monopolize information and to better understand why this is such a big deal, lets see what it would take to monopolize energy. 

the first and surprisingly easiest step, would be to create a viable source of free or almost free energy that you would then sell, probably through monthly payments, to the entire world. miniature thorium reactors, or breakthroughs in fusion technology could potentially do this. There is more to be done however...

1. In order for your business to last for centuries, your device needs to be impossible to recreate by anybody except your business and those associated with it. 
2. it needs to be cheap, very cheap, and yet generate revenue regularly no matter the conditions or state of the world.
3. It needs to be constantly improved, or somehow protected from the possibility of someone creating an even better idea and putting your company out of business. 

assuming all these goals are met, you would now be the owner of a business that will always generate profit, that will always exist and bring value to customers, and that exists in a market that grows as humanity grows, meaning your potential is linked to the success and proliferation of humanity.  With no possible competition, you would be the creator of the most successful company to ever exist. 

How now,  could this be accomplished with information, and how far is Palantir from achieving these same goals? is their product impossible to recreate? is it cheap and consistent with revenue? Is it immune to any possibility of anyone catching up with something even better? 

Almost. not quite yet, but they are surprisingly close.

&#x200B;

1. can their product be recreated?

technically yes, but both Gotham and Foundry are seeing adoption by some very important organizations. Gotham is already joined at the hip with the United States government, and with continued proven effectiveness and Palantir's willingness to make deals with other countries, its pretty much guaranteed that Gotham will be seeing mass adoption into other countries as well. Like a really nice disease, eventually everyone aligned with the United States will use it. 

Foundry's the big fish here though. The real deal and the reason Palantir is on track with their goal of becoming the biggest software company in the world. That's not me saying that, they literally make that claim in their most recent earnings report. 

All businesses and people essentially have the same problem. Data is very valuable, probably one of the most inherently valuable things in existence. Don't believe me? take a look at your computer. data is just the transfer of information and a computer is simply a really big bundle of information and tricks to measure that information.  A whole bunch of transistors turn on and off and through a massive amount of clever engineering and abstraction, all that data of whether or not something's on or off, 1 or 0, gets turned into your afternoon midget porn.  this is an extreme example of how much value can be pulled from data no matter  how  unimportant or useless it may seem. 100 years ago nobody would have ever guessed that stringing a bunch of lights together and having them interact through rules determined by whether they are on or off would possibly lead to what we have today but here we are. 

Data has value. The problem that every business has is that they have all this data, but how exactly do you extract value from that? how do you extract the most value possible? everyone has their own solutions to these problems, but there is no unification to any of it. This is where Foundry comes in.

Data that the Country or Business or person owns gets fed into Foundry, and everyone using it can assign specific rules to this data. This is a drastic oversimplification, but you frankly don't need to know the gritty details because they don't really matter here.  All you need to know is that  this oversimplification applies to computers as well. Computers are a massive collection of data, governed by rules where the result and potential uses are completely controlled by the person using the computer. 

There are plenty of questions here, how it works exactly, how private it is, what the use cases look like, and you can do this research on your own. What's interesting here is that while this product can definitely be recreated, its much much harder then it sounds and the fact that IBM and AWS have already given up and simply partnered with Palantir rather than try and recreate this technology just goes to show just how hard it would be to make a better Foundry or Gotham.  However, assuming that everyone eventually starts using this tech, what would happen if something better came along? 

2. Is Palantir's product immune to new and disruptive competition? 

The answer here is yes and absolutely. the REALLY neat thing about Foundry is that it essentially creates a perpetually self improving system. People input data and assign rules, but that data never disappears and those rules never change or are forgotten unless overruled by other more complex rules. this means that ANY new data added to the system is used to further improve the system.  Again if you  want more details do the research because I'm trying to talk to children here. 

I've been talking about data a lot but I feel I should stress the fact that your idea of what data is or can be is likely underdeveloped. did you poo today? what color was it? how soft was it?  was it chunkey or smooth?  how long were you on the toilet?  can any of this info be used to determine what you ate? how healthy you are?  what time did you poo?  do you poo in cycles or does it come randomly? can any of this information help predict when you will poo again?  maybe knowing these things can help you poo even better and more comfortably? 

This is all Data.  All of it can be used, and all of it has value to be found.  everything you see, do, feel, and think is data.  The number of ways this data can be connected and utilized to better understand the world and yourself is potentially infinite.  Therefore, a company that is able to create a product that can monopolize this potential could possibly grow even larger then one based on energy.  a product that is perpetually self improving will never be outpaced by anything else ESPECUALLY if they get a head start which is exactly what Palantir has spent 17 years and billions of dollars of R&D on. 

3. Is Palantir's product cheap and guaranteed to be profitably no matter the state of the world? 

I think it goes without saying that Software is the best business to be successful in. This is Unfortunately where Palantir is at their weakest currently, but as stated in their earnings report, they are hell bent on focusing on growth over everything else.  First they bag huge companies with lotsa money, then medium ones, then small businesses, and finally everyday average people.  Assuming company's continue to sign contracts, there will one day be a turning point where Palantir goes from a WSB name to a household one.  you wont even notice it happen, it will just happen. As for profitability regardless of the state of the world, Covid has already proven that Palantir's services are in very high demand. 

&#x200B;

On top of ALL this, Palantir is exclusively aligned with United States interests. Imagine if every country in the world used Palantir to some extent, and all that added value and power was exclusively controlled by the United States. There is an even bigger discussion to be had on the current technological race between the USA and China over who will perfect AI first, and the role Palantir will play in all this. The conclusion here is that whoever does win in the end, they will essentially decide the direction the world takes and how people in that world will live. This situation is very similar to the race between the U.S and Germany over who could invent the atomic bomb. luckily for us there's a lot less hot fiery death and a lot more new world order overshadowing the old one through the always watchful eyes of artificial intelligence. Elon musk is damn right to be afraid of AI, and If I had to pick one country to take it all I would like it to be the USA. This means that investing in Palantir is almost like betting on the United states in this all for one game. Make no mistake there is a very very good chance that whether or not you care about Palantir, your life is going to be affected by them one way or another. 

The moral of the story is buy the fucking dip and don't be a pussy about it. when you believe in a company enough it doesn't matter how much it dips because unless Karp and friends die in a fireball of death after boarding a small private jet to their mansions in Hawaii for a night of  drug fueled indulgences, the future will always be bright. If you're unsure about Palantir still don't worry.  They aren't going anywhere and there will be many many many more catalysts to fomo into and lose 50% of your portfolio on.

As an enterprise software company, it's really concerning that they can't turn a profit after all these years.

Software companies should generally have high profit margins because the marginal cost is near zero. Unless their services component is large, which is costly, or have other systemic problems. Their product is not magical and it requires a heavy handed sales component. That's why partnering with IBM makes sense for them. IBM has a special type of sales force for this kind of products and services. 

I have no doubt they will do better, but to have an insane valuation requires a solid path to profitability in the mass market."

So maybe in 5 years this company with an 80% adjusted growth margin and billions in free cash flow that just secured a security contract to protect the United States nuke supply will fail miserably and be a $10 stock or maybe it will be the western worlds premier data company.

2021-05-14 16:19:32,wallstreetbets,"If you really have a data science career, you understand that Palantir is a hype scam, right?

They are a good, valuable, solid company in some ways, but they just aren't what they claim to be (or what people seem to think they are publicly).

&#x200B;

The reason for their ""extreme integration"" is that they pay teams of data scientists to spend a ton of human hours tearing apart all of the systems of a client and then integrating them. The bit of ""ai"" is just gloss at the end.  


That's fine. They're basically a digital construction company. They build awesome skyscrapers for clients who they bill a lot of money per project.

&#x200B;

BUT, publicly they have everyone believing that they has some magical ""AI software"" that they deploy that simply magically analyzes all of a client's systems and ""radically integrates"" them in a cheap, scalable manner.

If their claims were true, then indeed, Palantir would be a $10 trillion company, no problem.

&#x200B;

But  their REAL business is almost the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of scalable and cheap because they have to 1) draw on the most limited labor pool in the world i.e. data scientists, 2) only hire the best of the best of them, and 3) pay those teams way above market rates to work for them (and they tend to massage this with huge stock awards to the teams).

&#x200B;

Is it a viable, profitable business in the end? Sure.

&#x200B;

Is it a limitless scalable master AI that freely lets them cash multi-million dollar project checks almost for free? No.

&#x200B;

What is another business where this happened recently: WeWork.

&#x200B;

Reporters would ask: ""So you make money by buying leases and subdividing them?"" and then founder/CEO Neumann would publicly always say, ""No, we're a scalable tech company!!!! We are changing work culture and living culture via proprietary technology!!!!""

&#x200B;

And they ballooned up to a $47 billion valuation before people finally realized the truth: they actually were just leasing property and subdividing leases.  


The same thing is happening with Palantir."
2021-05-14 02:01:27,wallstreetbets,"That's just sounds like a lot of buzzwords, not trying to roast your explanation but even the airbus article is buzzwordy. I don't know what it means to have data talking together, maybe you can have an aggregated view of many data pipelines? Uses AI to determine the best decision? So the basis of most real world AI is supervised learning. How can the software know the best decision for a scenario without training for it and also can you even train on something so random, you can't generalize decision making for any situation. The hot AI  rn is Machine learning specifically deep learning and it works well for a specialized task or prediction when you have lots of data covering a lot of cases with labeled predictions. ML sucks at generalized solutions so I'm really curious what their ai is actually doing?"

I'm not too familiar with the reasons for paying so much to employees, other than for retention of irreplaceable/rare skills. In any case, that sounds like an expensive R&D cost.

The reason people are blaming Palantir for all of the raids that happened is that they provided a much better tool to help those raids than the previous methods offered.  Blame the president, blame the leaders of ICE, but don‚Äôt blame the tool they used to track people.

Ice used palantir for raids yes, and maybe that is immoral, but these things happened because of rules created by elected officials. Eventually new officials are elected and those rules change as they already have. Palantir is not aligned with the government of the past but the present. They will continue to be used by the government for whatever they want and if the people dont like it we have established systems protected by the constitution to fight these things. Palantir is not emotionally aligned with anything but the constitution and the responsibility of servicing the government in their contractual obligations and to emotionally align yourself against them is to miss the point entirely."

I'm pretty convinced its a glorified BI dashboarding tool because I just can't wrap my mind around how Foundry and Gotham can magically join disparate data sources together and make insights happen. Anyone who has ever worked with big data knows almost all the work is in loading/preparing/cleaning data, which is incredibly manual because it's not something AI can easily figure out. Data doesn't magically 'talk' to each other without a lot of human input and I doubt Palantir has solved that aspect."

2021-05-13 21:37:12,wallstreetbets,"To be frank, the continued downward movement of PLTR is a symptom of general market bearishness rather than an indictment of the company itself. The only true strike mark against them is with regards to stock based compensation maturing in this time frame, which means that they are in a period of dilution. That said, a multitude of government contracts which are growing in value and number, rapid expansion into the private sector, and one deep ass moat around their technology means that this company isnt going anywhere for the foreseeable future, and actually should be increasing in value far faster than the rate of dilution. Recent earnings were bullish as hell, with all goals met or beat, and 30% YoY guidance reaffirmed. 

In short, my estimation is that the bearish market right now is a blessing in disguise, as I expect this stock to slingshot upwards in value when market conditions permit. From there, I believe it will stabilize at a significantly higher price per share. At that point, long term high returns will most likely continue unless or until guidance is revised to a lower level.

I dont write much DD, I'm just good at analyzing and drawing conclusions from it. Check out other posts and the recent earnings call if you want the hard numbers I'm getting this from."

2021-05-13 22:40:24,wallstreetbets,That means nothing in this market. MP beat earnings by over 1000% and look where they are now a few months later.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry BB Ivy's customer base revealed CIBC interview [click here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nyuz5eys7mwed4y/BlackBerry.mp4?dl=0)

Listen at time 26 minute

""With Ivy we launched in December, we began working on it well advanced of that, we began working with OEMs, Tier1s, and THE ECOSYSTEM in advanced of that.....so right now we're executing to the plan and we're delivering early access""

This means blackberry already has signed up OEMs and Tier1 to deploy Ivy and start monetizing. They are keeping the OEM and TIER1 SECRET for competitive and strategy reasons. T

i personally believe that with patent sale and Ivy ecosystem(OEM, TIER1) announcement the stock has huge potential. Remember, institutions own 50% of the share and only 250M remains in retail hands. 53M short. This will be bigger than January WSB event."
2021-05-13 21:27:13,wallstreetbets,Soooo 6$ BB calls?
2021-05-13 22:10:13,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, both will be fantastic potential! To add to that though go back and really listen to the QNX description. The CIBC guy is doing mental math on total installed cars, their past profit to try to project future revenues. 

He mentions TAM (Total Addressable Market), and ASP (Average Selling Price). 

What people aren't getting is QNX is one price, QNX Hypervisor is another price, and the Domain Controller is another (my best guess being a computer guy). 

So the next 175 Million cars sold with QNX will not yield 200 million (current profit). The next 175 million cars are looking at many multiples of licenses per car, and higher $ values for the premium licenses for Domain controllers and hypervisors. 

If the license count per car goes up 4 X , and some of the licenses are the premium licenses what does that do to the ASP/car and TAM calculation.

I think we are conservatively looking at a 2 x TAM, and 2 x ASP for QNX alone! \~ 800 million

Don't even get me started on IVY, or Security......."

2021-05-13 22:36:14,wallstreetbets,"No it‚Äôs really not more complicated, months before the deal was set it was called by every Racine Kenosha resident they would pull out or drastically fail to meet any of the contract  stipulations like they have in every other us based investment."
2021-05-13 23:14:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man. It's been shorted into oblivion the last couple of months. Short float is as much or more than $AMC now I believe. I've been accumulating longer term calls, so I'm hopeful for a nice squeeze."
2021-05-14 16:24:18,wallstreetbets,I sold $10C for 5/21. May close them before earnings. FSR may go parabolic in next one year.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Express ($EXPR) Stock: Over 10% Increase Explanation   Is this really true, we are doing a good job or is the market really paranoid about WSB?

&#x200B;

* **The stock price of Express, Inc. (NYSE: EXPR) increased by over 10% during intraday trading. This is why it happened.**

The stock price of Express, Inc. (NYSE: EXPR) increased by  over 10% during intraday trading. There was no direct news from the  company today so it appears that there are external factors in play.

 It appears [that the increase of AMC today](https://pulse2.com/amc-entertainment-nyse-amc-stock-over-25-increase-explanation/)  triggered a ‚Äúmeme‚Äù stock frenzy today by retail investors. Express is  part of a group of stocks that were short-squeezed in late January by  the r/WallStreetBets community on Reddit. So when the stock price of a  company in that group increases, the others also tend to increase as  well.

There will be counter forces on that like rental properties being attractive to buyers again which have not been because of the inability to evict bad tenants.

* Weak/cautious Q2 2021 guidance drove the stock down to almost half of ATH
* Shares are now below IPO price, at ATL
* Share lockup period expires 8/10/2021
* $MTCH now has an >8x greater valuation than $BMBL

**Bull Case**

* Online dating has displaced other ways of meeting in the US. That trend is likely to continue, growing the size of the pie for online dating companies. This trend is likely to be reproduced internationally, giving $BMBL an opportunity to acquire startups that succeed in emerging markets and protecting the company from one app going out of vogue. Match has survived doing the same thing.

* Women are more likely to perceive the pandemic as serious and comply with lockdowns ([https://voxeu.org/article/gender-differences-covid-19-perception-and-compliance](https://voxeu.org/article/gender-differences-covid-19-perception-and-compliance)), suggesting there may be suppression in online dating participation from women. $MTCH monetizes men while $BMBL monetizes women, so we could see stronger numbers than $BMBL expects as lockdown orders evaporate in the major cities. 
* Analyst targets imply a 50% upside as a ""Roaring 20s"" re-opening play. 
* Inflation numbers listed yesterday were heavily driven by used car sales, suggesting the broader tech sell off could be misguided.

&#x200B;

**Bear Case**

* Inflation lowers the value of recurring revenue technology companies. Since the app broadly targets consumers, it likely can't easily raise prices without losing paying users. Our perception of revenue multipliers for software companies could be completely wrong in this new era.
* Some women report that Bumble attracts men that prefer women chase them. It's unclear how this might affect Bumble's low term growth potential versus Match companies that favor a traditional dating strategy. 
* Very large percentage of the float available to short. The new low market cap may attract short sellers with a quick 20-40% upside.

I've probably paid for like 300 superswipes totaling around a grand in that time frame and received 1/10 the matches I do on Tinder and I only pay tinder $10-20/month and I've been using them for a decade. Lol.  

The only accurate statement you made is that $bmbl incentivizes monetization through women as opposed to through men, which if you think about it, is logically stupid bc men will always be down to pay more for the chance at getting laid.  Bmbl is going against the tide and cultural norms. Women who pay on these types of apps are desperate or slutty.  Not to mention most women, will just swipe which is free. 


I made about $160 back from a class action I just filled out against $bmbl bc they suck so much.  Getting anything over $7 from a class action is like big time they fucked up.  

Their algo is completely backwards.  

Source: I'm a solid 7/8 out of 10 man making 70k a year which in the SE is like 6 figures.  I have not had one match I liked in 4 weeks."

They're looking for the top 5% of guys, you're looking for the top 80% of women. Both sides are willing to pay.

Bumble's success just shows women are willing to pay more than you (men) to find a top 5% mate. If you think about it, they're willing to pay more to help find a scarcer resource."

Can that not be controlled by those who practically ‚Äôrun the world‚Äô? 

I believe they are purposely increasing prices and doing it at a rapid rate as compared to the past or through natural economic growth.  Could the reason for all of this be over population? I know that having kids has been of the factors decreasing due to higher prices. Bearing a child could at one point in the future be what only the wealthy could do/afford. Of course this may sound ridiculous to some.  but if we look at China and it‚Äôs income inequality those who are of the poorer spectrum, are having less kids.

2021-05-13 20:35:38,wallstreetbets,"Inflation can be though as a lag throughout a supply chain, based on wants and needs. It's obvious when you look at farming and seasonal supply chains.  In the end, everything will go up a bit at sometime, and we call this visible difference ""inflation"".  When money itself is scarce (i.e credit demand in 70s and 80s for boomer mortgages) it is a highly sought commodity on its own and the cost of the money feeds into inflation itself.  We are also at an historic time when death tolls from infant mortality, maternal mortality, and wars have decreased significantly.  Thus, the rise of other businesses such as tech, gaming, and service industries."

But that is the Fed's game plan."

If the government prints 5 trillion dollars, and 4.5 trillion goes into the pockets of people who never spend it, the economy at large probably won't see prices bid up. However, $5 trillion in the hands of people shouting ""WEN LAMBO"" will see a burger bid up to $50 real quick.

Yes, $56. Not $560, not $420, not even $100, the underlying value of TSLA is $56 per share. That's ASSUMING they grow as much as they claim they will next year. If we took their current P/E, and adjusted it to 25, the appropriate value per share would be $17.50. They are the most overvalued stock on the S&P500, they're almost Enron tier.

This is what rampant inflation does to a market. This is why you don't borrow six trillion dollars to spend on ""anythingyouwantstructure."" this is why you don't pay people to stay at home and not work. This is 100% the fault of Biden."

2021-05-14 03:17:38,wallstreetbets,"Pretty retarded. Tesla‚Äôs actual valuation using the discounted cash flow model and an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù growth outlook of the company in the next 5 years is around 200 dollars per share. It‚Äôs still grossly overvalued.

And the discounted cash flow model doesn‚Äôt even take into account the sharp increase in competition (right now Tesla is basically an EV monopoly) from all the other auto makers, plus the loss of al the cash from selling those environmentally friendly credits.

Definitely wouldn‚Äôt bet on TSLA right now."

2021-05-14 06:37:35,wallstreetbets,What's your strike price? You might be able to exercise some contracts if your strike price is lower than the current price.
2021-05-14 06:50:50,wallstreetbets,Solid research
2021-05-14 07:02:07,wallstreetbets,Stop using Robinhood you fucks

2021-05-14 15:54:01,wallstreetbets,"Eh, not quite sure that's how it works. A $500 stock can't ""rebound"", it's already extremely high priced."
2021-05-14 16:02:46,wallstreetbets,I did the opposite haha but I feel you. I was pretty red on Weds:
2021-05-14 16:52:14,wallstreetbets,Ohhh no
2021-05-14 18:13:15,wallstreetbets,Try selling vertical credit spreads instead of those debit buys and you might start making some money. They work even over a couple of days if you catch a trend.

2021-05-14 13:53:07,wallstreetbets,That was a bad trade
2021-05-14 15:52:24,wallstreetbets,Are you serious? 100 difference in such choppy market? When the contracts expire? We been calling TSLA short/puts since 680.
2021-05-14 13:15:40,wallstreetbets,Please post the next time you act on TSLA so I can do the opposite.

2021-05-14 17:30:55,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs true, but you may not be right until AFTER your puts expire. I thought long and hard about 300P 6-12 months out just to rub it in the face of all the Sheep on Elon‚Äôs dick. Decided against it."
2021-05-13 20:59:45,wallstreetbets,Well done you have sold before the crash. You can invest elsewhere good look.
2021-05-13 23:25:49,wallstreetbets,"This has both saved me and fucked me on short term calls. 

OP... maybe flip a coin? Heads you dip out, tails you double down?  This has also both saved me and fucked me. Lol"

2021-05-13 22:56:04,wallstreetbets,"Exercise as many of the calls as possible tomorrow and let's short squeeze the crap out of this lol. Options settle wednesday morning, like we saw on jan 22nd, so if enough people exercise their calls tomorrow it will get SUPER NUTTY next week.

I'm more than willing to take this bad boy to $500 per share. If we all load up on zero day calls with 25% chance to expire in the money like 2 hours before close, and then spike it into close AND EXERCISE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE CALLS, that will create a massive shortage of shares next week. Market makers typically only hedge like 10% of these getting exercised, and just imagine what happens when 90% get exercised... wire some cash in tomorrow same day"

did he buy a call with a lower strike price? help an ape out!"
2021-05-14 06:22:05,wallstreetbets,Major big clit energy
2021-05-13 20:43:47,wallstreetbets,You make an interesting point. I fear I have no choice but to agree.
2021-05-14 06:45:58,wallstreetbets,Lollll
2021-05-13 23:41:18,wallstreetbets,That was financial advice. Pay the man!
2021-05-13 20:59:27,wallstreetbets,I held. If I lose it all tomorrow I will just DECLARE BANKRUPTCY!
2021-05-14 04:15:43,wallstreetbets,before or after tax though?
2021-05-13 23:19:47,wallstreetbets,Whose money do you think I stole to make this dumb bet?
2021-05-13 20:13:55,wallstreetbets,You math good... But we still have tomorrow so will see if it pays off
2021-05-14 06:39:22,wallstreetbets,Practice on fake accounts. Save you money. And learn how they work... Then get lucky
2021-05-14 19:07:05,wallstreetbets,First ones free
2021-05-13 20:50:07,wallstreetbets,"Two weeks ago for the 28ths. Monday and Tuesday for the ones expiring tomorrow. 

Why?: 100 percent borrow utilization (no shares available to short) 

Friday, Monday and Tuesday 80 percent loan rate with 4 days to cover. So thought Thursday or Friday could pop in addition with Delta hedging. 

Knew their offering was about over so much less downward pressure and AMC has enough liquidity for the next 2 years ruling out bankruptcy (the reason it's so heavily shorted to begin with)"
2021-05-14 00:53:59,wallstreetbets,"Because the 10.5call printed Hella comparatively. Dumb ape make dumb money, smart ape get smart gets put down."
2021-05-14 06:38:19,wallstreetbets,In simple ape terms.... I bought the 9.5 calls when the stock price was around 9.20.. bought the 10.50 calls when the SP price was around 10.. cheaper otm calls print bigger.
2021-05-13 23:32:09,wallstreetbets,Which ones did you sell?
2021-05-14 02:28:41,wallstreetbets,I think it will back to $10 a share
2021-05-13 22:24:01,wallstreetbets,üòÇüòÇ it's a 50/50 for me either I get hurt or Melvin gets hurt.   Hope your odds are better.
2021-05-14 06:14:12,wallstreetbets,And that's why u didn't make 100K like OP :)
2021-05-14 19:07:29,wallstreetbets,Leverage
2021-05-13 22:48:21,wallstreetbets,What threads do you follow on Stocktwits? All the ones I‚Äôve read everyone sounds literally retarded.

2021-05-14 06:33:37,wallstreetbets,2 weeks ago on half. Mon Tuesday and some in the am on the Friday expirations
2021-05-13 22:19:29,wallstreetbets,Look through comments
2021-05-13 23:18:19,wallstreetbets,The trick is to buy before they go up
2021-05-13 23:30:38,wallstreetbets,"Hell no, it's early still!

&#x200B;

\*fyi, I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice."
2021-05-13 23:14:45,wallstreetbets,"GME

2021-05-13 20:15:28,wallstreetbets,TD took off the sell button
2021-05-14 02:28:19,wallstreetbets,"I know right . i love how he actually wrote a long thought out response to the question also, as if it wasnt just total fucking luck that this share offering happened the day before his shit expired totally worthless.  saddest part is this will give so many retards hope that this will be them with their 17 amc shares"
2021-05-14 02:31:09,wallstreetbets,"yes, exactly this."

2021-05-13 20:14:48,wallstreetbets,I don't think he asked you too
2021-05-13 22:19:51,wallstreetbets,Why would you be mad?
2021-05-14 02:32:27,wallstreetbets,check out tastytrades on utube. he has some really good options tutorials. u arent going to get a real explination in any comment. its something that requires in depth explanations and seeing it visualized. also u never fully learn until u dive in and lose ur own money
2021-05-14 07:38:39,wallstreetbets,What if he sold the 13s to exercise the 9s
2021-05-13 22:05:43,wallstreetbets,He could sell some for capital
2021-05-13 23:32:50,wallstreetbets,You make an interesting conclusion. I fear I have no choice but to conclude the same.
2021-05-14 10:14:17,wallstreetbets,"Woah woah woah, no financial advice here. Only degenerates."
2021-05-13 22:49:43,wallstreetbets,"You do know that you can't JUST say that you declare bankruptcy though, right...?"
2021-05-14 02:09:36,wallstreetbets,You'll be fine. AMC hits $20 tomorrow.

2021-05-13 22:30:27,wallstreetbets,i see de way
2021-05-14 07:47:33,wallstreetbets,Why are you saying 100 percent borrow utilization? There are gazzilions shares to borrow everywhere lol. More borrows = more squeeze potential.
2021-05-14 05:06:23,wallstreetbets,Price target next week?
2021-05-14 05:53:45,wallstreetbets,Good due diligence please cash out amc as a company is worth jack diddly

2021-05-13 21:15:56,wallstreetbets,For real?
2021-05-14 02:51:06,wallstreetbets,"So you state a price you think the actual share value will be at a certain date, and then you get to sell the share for that price even though you only paid like a fraction? And the guy who owns the share who called a put has to pay out?"
2021-05-13 22:22:55,wallstreetbets,SELL?????
2021-05-14 00:07:13,wallstreetbets,You make a conclusive point here. I have no choice but to show interest in your fear.

2021-05-14 06:06:19,wallstreetbets,"I'm just throwing my feces against the wall bro. But if you look at the percentage change, it was the 10 that mooned, not the 9.. and that's just how options go went approaching expiry and the squeeze gets put on."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Nikola may come back from the dead So I recently did some day trading with NKLA and made a solid $25 bucks (I know...thanks)

With that said I started to look at the company again after the borderline fraud scheme seems to be hitting the bottom.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tailwinds

1. Losses per share well beat expectations for the quarter. Projection was -$0.46 and they [actually](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nkla/earnings) lost -$0.31/share.....still losing money, but not as fast
2. The Tre (Chinese for 3) recently had a [successful](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/nikola-tre-semi-ev-drag-races-ford-f-350-work-truck-holds-up-well-for-a-while-160876.html) second place finish is a drag race against a Ford F350. Yeah I know it lost, but it held it's ground and shows that there is a functional prototype. Unlike the million EV car companies, TSLA and DDIAF (eCascadia) are the only (known to me) EV long haul truck companys competing, please enlighten me if you know more. BTW:[eCascadia](https://freightliner.com/trucks/ecascadia/?gclid=CjwKCAjwnPOEBhA0EiwA609ReaHPFfSnVomfrb5lOe0dcGAkOkMF-ec-TZ11GsUDMBWIbvxKMQMZzxoCJCUQAvD_BwE) looks cool
3. Nikola has a [LOI](https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-iveco-and-oge-announce-intent-to-accelerate-the-deployment-of-hydrogen-infrastructure-and-fueling-solutions-116) with some Germans to eat Schnitzel and create a hydrogen fuel cell infrastructure in Europe. This is a big deal because Germany is ([maybe](https://electrek.co/2016/06/14/all-new-cars-mandated-electric-germany-2030/)) going all electric by 2030 and Nikola could be a major winner on the logistics front. Once in Germany (The largest economy in Europe), it will more easily branch to the rest of the EU. 
4. The Shares are pretty cheap, being $0.35 on the 52 weak low.

Headwinds

1. They have sold zero semi-trucks
2. If you try to buy a truck you can only send an email to a [faceless void](https://nikolamotor.com/two#motor-contact).
3. Like other blank check EV offerings, NKLA is being chased by [lawyers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-03/spac-crackdown-threatens-gauzy-forecasts-that-power-ev-startups).

&#x200B;

Conclusion: I'm keeping my money on the sideline for now, but if there is any updates on the Germany junk or actual sales, I'll come back around. This could go to zero or probably $50-60/share based on news."
2021-05-13 20:15:08,wallstreetbets,Lol.....No. This company is a joke and the share price is only being propped up to current value by bagholders that refuse to realize their 60%+ loss desperately hoping for greater fools to take their place.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Natera (NTRA) - Long Term or Short Term Biotech Play Fellow morons,

I'm going to keep this more or less brief, even though I'm sure no one will actually read this. Being in medical school, I may be slightly less retarded than some of you, at least when it comes to identifying groundbreaking biotech companies. Pretty much all my friends are tired of hearing me talk about this company, even as they have increased from $35 pre-pandemic to $125 in February. Just kidding, I don't have any friends.

Natera (NTRA) is a diagnostic genetics company that specializes in the following three areas:

1) **Pre-natal testing:** making sure your kids aren't retarded

2) **Pre-transplant testing:** making sure your dumbass immune cells don't fuck up that new kidney you just got transplanted

3) **Cancer testing:** Finding out how much cancer is in your body by looking at the pieces of DNA that the cancer cells shed into your blood. The way we do this nowadays is by CT scans or MRIs, which aren't bad but can't find the cancer until it is big enough to see (\~5 mm). Also, they cost a shit ton of money, and CT scans expose you to radiation (which can cause more cancer later).

Point #3 is the reason why an irresponsibly large portion of my portfolio is in this company. They are already approved in **colorectal cancer** to:

1) Detect the levels of cancer in your body after surgery and help the oncologist determine if chemotherapy is even necessary

2) Determine whether the patient is responding to chemotherapy

3) Find out if the patient's cancer has come back on a microscopic level way before a scan could

The way these kinds of tests go in terms of FDA approval is that **they get approved in one cancer type initially before getting approved in cancer in general**. More cancer types = more revenue = higher stock price. As it turns out, all cancers are kind of fundamentally the same regardless of where they come from in your body. This was the case with Foundation Medicine (FMI), a company I YOLO'd on before they got bought out at $137 a share that was first to market in qualitative tumor measurement (Natera's test is quantitative). Oh, and Natera works with Foundation Medicine, so they will probably end up being first to market in this expanding indication too.

Natera just annihilated earnings but has sold off because all growth stocks are selling off. Their Y/Y revenue increased by 62%, and they have risen after earnings every single earnings report for the last 5 or so quarters. Median price target is $137.50. 

**The only reason I'm not buying more is that I pay $40,000 a year to harvest old men's discharge from their cocks and am out of cash. Don't be like me; buy this shit at a discount and watch it print fat stacks.**

$Long NTRA, $NTRA 120c 6/18

**TL;DR:** Natera (NTRA) is going to change the way we treat cancer, just crushed earnings, and is only selling off because growth stocks are selling off. They will inevitably surpass previous highs barring macroeconomic growth stock clusterfucks."

2021-05-13 21:02:31,wallstreetbets,SNDL diluted when the share price was very high. Other marijuana companies that recently diluted are selling shares at very low price and so their dilution is not as effective. SNDL over the past few weeks have released some promising news about M&A. On their balance sheet they have around 1 billion in cash. They can use this to conduct worldwide M&A and develop a sustainable business model. SNDL has lots of future potential and I believe it will the industry leader in a few years!

They will grow so much the price of cannabis will tank and these currently traded cannabis stocks will be ruined and try to merge with each other in the hopes of staying around.  The worst thing for the companies (which they won‚Äôt say) is the federal government legalizing cannabis."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CCL / Carnival Cruise Line I've made a bit since last year playing the ups and downs on CCL stock, put in about 1k when it crashed down to 8$ at the start of the covid nonsense, and kept feeding it every time it dipped. with a good half dozen complete sell offs when it peaked only to buy back in within 1-2 weeks when it dipped again.  
As it stands, I think the cruise industry got hit the worst by covid, but I think its popular enough that it will be around long after the plague ends.  This stock was in the high 60$s in 2018, and down from some mishaps to the 50$s and high 40$s in 2019.   Its got good potential in a long run of doubling any investment, but that could be 3 to 5 years at the earliest.  For the short haul though, it has dipped back down to 25$\~ and could easily rebound as it has the past 3 months bouncing between 25$ and 30$  
Other than like 10 AMC stock and a clutch few GME, I think this is my cash cow, and uhh, I like you apes, so look into it and decide if its right for you, cheers.

2021-05-13 23:23:27,wallstreetbets,"I don't previous highs are in play, but 40 is a legit good target. That's nearly 50% upside. I like it."
2021-05-14 03:37:23,wallstreetbets,"I think cruises are pretty much dead for the next few years:
- they have to rehire a massive amount of people and will have lost a lot of experienced staff. Higher costs and worse service ahoy.

- as pointed out above, they are drowning in debt so future profitability is eaten up be interest payments. Even if they recover to 2019 income, they won't be able to return to 2019 profits.

- the risk of getting stuck on a boat with a disease is now a real threat that people buying holidays will factor in. Maybe it's not rational, but risk-averse boomers will be thinking about this.

- the boats have been depreciating and have likely been under-maintained during Covid. Also if their future profitability is reduced, they will need to write down the value of the boat assets. A small change in NBV of the boats will wipe out several years of profit.

So to me this would be a risk worth looking at if Carnival was still 80-90% down from its 2019 high. It's currently around 58% down from pre-Covid so I think it's currently at a price that fairly represents its lower future cash flows. Maybe a bit of room for growth, but I think 2x from here even over the next 10 years is unlikely because the debt is so massive.

As the vaccine % rise and lockdown restrictions reduce, the amount of people looking to finally travel to out are going to blow up. I believe there is pent up demand.

2021-05-13 20:14:11,wallstreetbets,I really think there is enough room for a few lidar companies. I also hold LAZR. The thing with AEVA is that it is founded by former Apple engineers Soroush Salehian and Mina Rezk. I believe the mystery company they talked about in the earnings call today is Apple because of the obvious connections. That would make this company soar into the stratosphere
2021-05-13 20:38:57,wallstreetbets,I totally agree with you.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Time to sell TSLA Elon Musk is unstable and attention crazed. TSLA made a billion dollar investment and backed out in three months. This is either a lack of due diligence and incompetence OR a transparent attempt to manipulate earnings because they do not make enough money selling electric vehicles.

This is in addition to lack of vehicle demand in China. the long term future of Tesla is in the hands of a man stripped of his Chairmanship, is obsessed with his second rocket company and moonlights as a twitter/social media celebrity while also dating 20 year olds and hitting up night clubs. EDIT: He also uses TSLA as a credit card with 92 million shares pledged for loans EDIT 2: apparently grimes is 33. My bad. I was more alluding to their strange behavior together than the still quite sizable age gap

&#x200B;

Sell TSLA. There are better investments for your money. the stock is over valued because of Musk. Musk is becoming more and more unpredictable.

&#x200B;

Once all of the car companies ramp up, Tesla will sell zero credits. They will lose money and be forced to raise their price to $150k. It‚Äôs going to be like a Ferrari. Ridiculously expensive, not the best performing, looks pretty.

2021-05-14 00:27:41,wallstreetbets,We found Gordon Johnson's reddit account
2021-05-14 00:32:03,wallstreetbets,So you bought a bunch of current technologies from a company that you hate? Makes complete sense!
2021-05-14 00:32:21,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-14 00:32:41,wallstreetbets,Who the fook is this guy?
2021-05-14 00:38:40,wallstreetbets,"lol you really hating on our generations genius. Hes literally doing things that people like you think is crazy. People called our greatest inventors and geniuses crazy yet they pathed the way for our future and kids future. 

TSLA will go down though but not for any reasons here lol, you own gme and amc so you know how liquidation works once these hedges bleed out cash."
2021-05-14 00:40:21,wallstreetbets,TSLA's value depends on Elon's ability to hype himself and his companies.
2021-05-14 00:43:41,wallstreetbets,"Why is this post here? Are we now being pussies and posting rants because we lost money on calls that are expiring EOW? LOL 

&#x200B;

WSB has changed man, where the OG days where gals like OP would just straight up post loss porn vs. this."
2021-05-14 01:06:15,wallstreetbets,"Oof. Almost lost me with your gme and AMC holdings. But you didn't tell us to buy those, so maybe you have a brain after all."
2021-05-14 01:12:43,wallstreetbets,The Powerwall 2 looks really cool though. Are there any better batteries out there than that?
2021-05-14 01:21:09,wallstreetbets,What is this 2017 again?
2021-05-14 01:30:09,wallstreetbets,"Never discount Musk, ban this guy"
2021-05-14 01:38:47,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha, ohh God.."
2021-05-14 01:43:45,wallstreetbets,49/2 +7 =31.5 years old
2021-05-14 01:44:15,wallstreetbets,Pledging shares as collateral is part of a greater tax strategy. Its not because he doesn't have any money lol...
2021-05-14 01:46:24,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm no warren buffet but I have a lot more confidence in Elon Musks continued success than I do in yours. 

When you become the richest man in the world and send people to Mars let me know and I‚Äôll consider following your advice  a little more seriously."
2021-05-14 01:47:35,wallstreetbets,Tesla to 4K!!!!! Yeah üí∞!!
2021-05-14 02:00:26,wallstreetbets,"SpaceX is his first job, not Tesla."
2021-05-14 02:02:50,wallstreetbets,Lol. You people were calling him Daddy Elon just a couple months ago. Funny how your positions dictate how you see people.
2021-05-14 02:06:53,wallstreetbets,I wish the reddit folks would short the hell out of Tesla.. that would teach the b*stard Elon a good lesson for toying with people‚Äôs investments!
2021-05-14 02:08:05,wallstreetbets,"None of this is new, though. Musk has posted insane stuff on Twitter before, and then continued to release another wildly successful car.

A better argument is that the current price of Tesla is overinflated, which it undoubtedly is. But that doesn't mean Tesla won't continue to be wildly successful."
2021-05-14 02:22:44,wallstreetbets,"TSLA is old news, move on"
2021-05-14 02:23:19,wallstreetbets,What part of not selling is backing out?
2021-05-14 02:29:58,wallstreetbets,Elon musk doesn't know how to shut up sometimes like a certain mentally unstable orange president
2021-05-14 02:37:25,wallstreetbets,"OP sounds big mad, labeled it a discussion but didn‚Äôt ask any questions..."
2021-05-14 03:13:25,wallstreetbets,People sold a lot of 880 Tesla stocks to buy in gme. When gme and amc release the moon tendies ppl won‚Äôt forget papa musk. Let‚Äôs not forget it was him and Ryan Cohen and dfv that started this party. Anyone else missing papa musk gme moon memes
2021-05-14 03:18:12,wallstreetbets,"This was exactly my logic when I dumped A LOT of TSLA @ $60/share equivalent (pre split) a couple of years ago. It was around the time of the 420 tweet. 

I think about this decision every day.

Musk is unpredictable and quirky, sure.

Starlink IPO should be interesting....."
2021-05-14 03:26:28,wallstreetbets,Sell tesla buy GME can it be anymore obvious
2021-05-14 03:27:59,wallstreetbets,"TSLA‚Äôs price target with the discounted cash flow method is around 200 dollars per share. Take that as you will. It‚Äôs a cool company, but still grossly overvalued."
2021-05-14 03:31:16,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! Two months
2021-05-14 03:48:13,wallstreetbets,In Musk we trust
2021-05-14 03:53:24,wallstreetbets,So what you‚Äôre saying is you got puts on TSLA and it‚Äôs not looking good for you so you wrote up a Elon FUD post? Or did you pull a Rip VanWinkle from December 2019 to now then not look at any information about Tesla before posting this whimsically?
2021-05-14 04:00:34,wallstreetbets,"So you‚Äôre saying I should short GME? That can‚Äôt be right.

I‚Äôll buy more GME and TSLA.

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)"
2021-05-14 04:20:16,wallstreetbets,Sell Tesla but buy GME and AMC ahahahahahahahaha genuine retard
2021-05-14 04:37:27,wallstreetbets,Somebodies spaghetti is upsetti
2021-05-14 05:17:03,wallstreetbets,So then sell your TSLA and move one.  Unless you're waiting to buy low?  Hmm...
2021-05-14 05:29:00,wallstreetbets,Nightclubs and banging 20 years olds!!And you are telling me Not to invest in that?? Mf I‚Äôm doubling down lol
2021-05-14 05:46:31,wallstreetbets,"Only 4 words ***tsla 500 buy order*** 

if had only the money"
2021-05-14 05:48:09,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs been especially weird Thea past while even by Elon standards
2021-05-14 05:48:21,wallstreetbets,"You got me in the first half, I thought you really know what you talking about but when I read at the end that you're not long on Tesla but you have gme and amc it clicked for me.

Good luck with your gme and amc shares and let me hold my Tesla, time will tell who made the best decision !"
2021-05-14 06:18:07,wallstreetbets,"Let‚Äôs face it, he‚Äôs just Tony Stark"
2021-05-14 07:07:40,wallstreetbets,"Once you said you own gme and amc

I discounted everything you said"
2021-05-14 07:16:45,wallstreetbets,Moron
2021-05-14 07:17:51,wallstreetbets,My guess is you got hammered shorting it
2021-05-14 07:46:36,wallstreetbets,The guy is sending rockets hauling loads of statlites into outer space like 2 or 3 times a month........ we will probably be heading to Mars soon because of his innovation. I love your brand of armchair quarterbacking manü§£
2021-05-14 07:52:29,wallstreetbets,remember when Elon called that diver a pedo LMFAO
2021-05-14 08:42:45,wallstreetbets,what do u think of nio instead then?
2021-05-14 08:45:34,wallstreetbets,His short TSLA üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2021-05-14 09:01:22,wallstreetbets,"so, you‚Äôre telling a bunch of retards to sell something because the CEO went full retard?"
2021-05-14 09:02:21,wallstreetbets,"I already know he has a tweet lined up ‚Äú we solved the environmental issues with it by carbon offsetting and will be open purchases ‚Äú   It will shoot to 65k thinking he solved the Middle East crisis 

Look at the positive of the rumors are he bought at 30k and ‚Äú sold  ‚Äú even if he did at 40k he made a good fucking profit for the company .

I guarantee he bought the dip and will enjoy the profits of going from 50k to 60k+"
2021-05-14 09:03:33,wallstreetbets,Let me guess... You own some coin that Elon no longer supports...
2021-05-14 09:14:25,wallstreetbets,Calls boys
2021-05-14 09:20:08,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is a good stock for daytrading. As a long hold it seems like gambling to me, valuation is still very high here and the future bull cases with robotaxis etc seem like fantasies at this point in time."
2021-05-14 09:39:28,wallstreetbets,"Dude idk where you've been but nothing you mentioned hasn't already happened before in some way or form. Tesla makes crazy decisions all the time that defy logic, and Elon Musk is and has always been unhinged. Long $TSLA WOOOOO!!!!!"
2021-05-14 09:55:33,wallstreetbets,"They didn‚Äôt quite back out, the investment is still
There"
2021-05-14 10:12:15,wallstreetbets,He spreading fud so he can sell miners carbon credits
2021-05-14 10:24:57,wallstreetbets,"Well if it makes u feel better. atleast eth is worth more than tesla stock. It's ok for everyone to choose what happened to ""I like the stock"" lol you can always diversify your portfolio. Everyone is judgemental. If you like the stock buy it if you don't then that's OK too."
2021-05-14 10:28:20,wallstreetbets,if you had his money you would be getting 20 year old pussy too.
2021-05-14 10:53:30,wallstreetbets,I say we YOLO TSLA calls for today. $650 looking like a nice round number.
2021-05-14 11:13:34,wallstreetbets,Elon summed it up well in his SNL monologue - you can't expect a person who is revolutionizing 4 different industries to be sane or reasonable
2021-05-14 11:22:38,wallstreetbets,"It's time to BUY TSLA. They have several great projects in the pipeline. The Cybertruck, New Roadster, Semi-Truck, Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Full Self-drive. Besides other parallel business like Energy Power Packs, Solar Roof, Insurance, Supercharger Station Network. The simple comparison with other auto-makers is superficial."
2021-05-14 11:44:20,wallstreetbets,!Remindme 99 days
2021-05-14 12:19:04,wallstreetbets,"Bitter loss, and no one will listen"
2021-05-14 13:13:11,wallstreetbets,TSLA is one of few stocks that could be up 3% in 24 hours and having investors jumping ship.
2021-05-14 13:34:35,wallstreetbets,"OP, buys puts.

Now it's time to harness the power of social media to manipulate the market mwuhaha"
2021-05-14 13:37:06,wallstreetbets,"don't believe everything you see in the news there are alot of hypotheticals recommendations on the air just what if this what if that, you need to do your ground work and validate everything your hear dealing with speculation without any validity. look at the stocks market historical data and compare that to start with it. Yes the stocks market now   is down but everything that goes up have to come down and everything that is down soon  or later with goes up too. Validation of the information is the best advice I can give to anyone..."
2021-05-14 15:57:20,wallstreetbets,"So, let me get this straight.  


He invested and made hundreds of millions in a few months, then pulled it out before it crashed, and you think this is evidence that I **shouldn't** trust him with money?"
2021-05-13 20:30:16,wallstreetbets,"U stupid fuck it was time at 800 not now u fool 

Suck some
Cock and be useful"
2021-05-13 20:53:24,wallstreetbets,BET AGAINST PAPA MUSK?!  NEVER GO FULL RETARD!
2021-05-13 20:58:26,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I will buy more tomorrow"
2021-05-13 21:05:47,wallstreetbets,Oversold on most metrics...but he wants you to sell...fuck him and buy!
2021-05-13 20:07:33,wallstreetbets,"I buy this, makes sense. A bit too rational for wsb but it's a good point. What say you about ARK? You trust Cathie to dump TSLA or should we dump her like my wife dumped me?"
2021-05-13 20:09:55,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre an idiot if you sell now
2021-05-13 20:10:45,wallstreetbets,blah blah blah
2021-05-13 20:11:13,wallstreetbets,The guy that makes the most money is making the most craziest risky moves. Dam shocking
2021-05-13 20:26:39,wallstreetbets,Tesla is the way to go and Elon can do what he wants. The man is a billionaire and we all want to be him. I support whatever that man does.
2021-05-13 20:29:24,wallstreetbets,ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
2021-05-13 20:32:06,wallstreetbets,Ok will add some more $TSLA shares tomorrow for long bucket. Thanks for the suggestion
2021-05-13 20:35:57,wallstreetbets,In just commenting to come back and say how fucking retarded and stupid you are.
2021-05-13 20:41:43,wallstreetbets,They're sitting on their 200 sma. Either they melt back up and everyone sleeps soundly or cnbc keeps preaching the commodity supercycle and inflation hellscapes. I don't know about you guys but let me know if you finally get Cramers cell. I think it makes more sense to be a short term Tesla bear
2021-05-13 20:55:56,wallstreetbets,Or he is attempting to lower the price so others can enter the market.
2021-05-13 21:00:48,wallstreetbets,"Boils some tsla today - even if it turns out to be just a short trade, it has a few more pops left in the battery..."
2021-05-13 21:03:12,wallstreetbets,"You are supposed to sell when it gets high, you goofball."
2021-05-13 21:17:13,wallstreetbets,Sounds like somebody shorted.....
2021-05-13 21:17:17,wallstreetbets,"Brave of you to create this post in this echo chamber  


Honestly, the board has to losing their minds with him lately"
2021-05-13 21:22:54,wallstreetbets,"How about you go ahead and sell, afterwards, go jerk your wife's boyfriend off in front of your kids"
2021-05-14 04:32:59,wallstreetbets,This is the correct answer.
2021-05-14 09:28:59,wallstreetbets,Why are you so smart üé£
2021-05-14 15:07:35,wallstreetbets,"Did I hear buy 1000c expiring tomorrow(now today, even better). Consider it done....havin a full hour until market close seems like free money"
2021-05-13 21:53:39,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-13 22:47:13,wallstreetbets,Under $500 is my reload price too.
2021-05-13 23:40:01,wallstreetbets,I'd hold off until 200.
2021-05-14 00:07:40,wallstreetbets,One thing everyone seems to not be acknowledging is the majority of Tesla‚Äôs revenue has come from selling electric credits to companies that primarily make gas vehicles. Over the past two years 90% of those have been sold to Damler Chrysler (or however you spell it). They just bought an electric division and said they will no longer be buying credits. Without them Tesla would‚Äôve had very negative earnings the past few years. Look up the Forbes article about it from a week or so ago
2021-05-13 20:02:02,wallstreetbets,Nice! Just loaded up on 230 calls all the way up to 800. Retirement play.
2021-05-13 20:46:05,wallstreetbets,So TSLA did everything wrong? Calls all the way around.  I knew TSLA sitting at $570 had to be a meme so I better load up now. Weekly 2000Cs is it then?
2021-05-13 21:34:39,wallstreetbets,Those will print mad money.
2021-05-14 03:14:18,wallstreetbets,All my energy and retirement into margin TSLA calls AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH
2021-05-14 06:38:31,wallstreetbets,You sir are my hero.
2021-05-13 22:11:18,wallstreetbets,Yea dudes spreading FUD
2021-05-14 00:32:34,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-14 05:39:34,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-14 09:01:04,wallstreetbets,Even OP's mother is cringing at this advice. She just saw Elon on SNL and thought he was charming and intelligent and funny. She loves that he's thinking green and not afraid to cut his losses or put his money where his heart is.
2021-05-14 09:01:10,wallstreetbets,Even OP's mother is cringing at this advice. She just saw Elon on SNL and thought he was charming and intelligent and funny. She loves that he's thinking green and not afraid to cut his losses or put his money where his heart is.
2021-05-13 20:41:18,wallstreetbets,Anytime someone says no it always goes good. Elon good boy. Buy till your duck falls off.
2021-05-13 20:53:27,wallstreetbets,If you want more money sell now and invest the proceeds more wisely. üí≤ü™ôüí∞
2021-05-14 04:36:34,wallstreetbets,Uk tbvh gme as of now might actually be a really good play in the long term if you got in before 120 or so
2021-05-14 05:31:55,wallstreetbets,"Exactly

That's every guy's dream when he's older

And I hear women like older (RICH) men too"
2021-05-14 00:23:22,wallstreetbets,"I know right? Its the only reason for fame. Id love to be rich, hate to be famous, but banging 20 year olds till you die might be worth it."
2021-05-13 20:21:55,wallstreetbets,And Elon‚Äôs dad fucked his granddaughter or some shit like that...
2021-05-13 23:50:16,wallstreetbets,Except that there's 20 of them.
2021-05-13 22:03:31,wallstreetbets,Not at all
2021-05-14 00:28:13,wallstreetbets,"I mostly agree with OP, however if it dips to under 400 it'll be a good buying opportunity. It's clear that Elon is losing it, maybe he'll recover from it maybe he won't. If you're planning on buying TSLA then ask yourself - how much would Tesla be worth without Elon? And then set your buy orders at that limit."
2021-05-14 04:47:33,wallstreetbets,Tesla up 2% premarket. I'm inversing this guy with some 0DTE calls at open
2021-05-14 09:22:53,wallstreetbets,Remind me! 2 months
2021-05-13 20:47:51,wallstreetbets,My favorite is when you say something critical of him and then everyone on this sub says it‚Äôs because you are jealous of him Lolol.
2021-05-14 00:12:44,wallstreetbets,Na man we just love what he‚Äôs doing
2021-05-14 10:30:09,wallstreetbets,"I'm not a fan of what he does on Twitter or in media in general, but tell me a person who does more for the future of humanity than he does. I'll wait.

EDIT: Well, now I've waited, so I guess that's settled then."
2021-05-14 00:47:35,wallstreetbets,build quality yes. Tech no. Tesla is way ahead from a tech perspective.
2021-05-13 21:28:37,wallstreetbets,Well said Tesla is heeding for the strap heap there are far better cars out there. Nio will soon overtake Tesla. In China Nio as solved the problem of it taking a long time to recharge as it as a  growing network of battery changing stations where you can drive in and they swap your batteries over. Apparently you can be on your way in less than five minutes not much longer than  filling a petrol car.
2021-05-13 23:02:40,wallstreetbets,How much of a car company is Tesla vs an energy storage and AI company?
2021-05-14 01:07:44,wallstreetbets,Their.....
2021-05-14 14:51:22,wallstreetbets,Tesla will sell better in Europe once giga Berlin opens up. They will be able to sell the model y significantly cheaper
2021-05-13 20:44:57,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a good argument for dog money then.
2021-05-14 08:40:07,wallstreetbets,"Enron, learn from history."
2021-05-14 17:42:29,wallstreetbets,Well if the stock has volatile price movements based on hype it must be good. bUY!!!!
2021-05-14 03:21:30,wallstreetbets,"Its not magic coin, that just makes you sound like a bitter loser. The scientific term is ""imaginary internet monies""."
2021-05-14 10:42:45,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, i am sure he did that"
2021-05-13 21:46:10,wallstreetbets,"And the 25k car.

And then, one day in the distant future, the pivot towards a Robotaxi based business model."
2021-05-14 01:23:40,wallstreetbets,Battery and software technology is light years ahead for Tesla compared to other companies
2021-05-14 15:00:03,wallstreetbets,Quality control issues almost exclusively linked to their fremont plant. The newer shanghai plant is much more representative of the future. And production numbers continue to ramp up I don't see what issue there is here
2021-05-13 21:35:28,wallstreetbets,Yes and just think if everyone on WB sold there Tesla shares how many AMC shares we could buy.
2021-05-13 21:49:05,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not just China. Every major industrialized country at some level considers auto manufacturing to be a national security issue. Tesla just won‚Äôt be allowed to swallow market share. 

A Tesla factory in France would get firebombed in month. Unions there are nuts."
2021-05-13 22:04:06,wallstreetbets,"I kinda feel EV is going to happen the same way the 5G tech unfolded. 

Huawei got all these contracts for 5G across the world, people complained and eventually they were cancelled for security reasons. 

I feel like the Chinese EVs will get into global markets, while blocking Tesla and musk will bitch to Congress that it‚Äôs not fair because China is blocking them/VW/GM and others while they operate globally. Chinese EVs will get banned in the US/EU and we‚Äôll have fractured EV markets. 

Just speculation and brainstorming, but I could see it happen."
2021-05-13 21:02:20,wallstreetbets,Buy NIO?
2021-05-13 21:08:49,wallstreetbets,are you aware how much china helped Tesla set up that factory?... now your saying china is a problem xD LMAOOO
2021-05-13 21:18:43,wallstreetbets,"The Chinese always steal tech,  they haven't invented anything since gunpowder.  Why invent when people are stupid enough to let you steal their tech so I guess it's a sound strategy that never fails"
2021-05-13 23:46:43,wallstreetbets,TSLA needs e-motorcycle.... lots of people of China will ride it ü¶çü¶çüöÄüöÄ
2021-05-14 00:34:06,wallstreetbets,I don't currently own Tsla but having been to China many times for work. They pay a premium to own Apple and Samsung because they attribute that to America. They will likely pay a premium to own a Tsla as well. It's all about imagine and anything American is gold over there.
2021-05-13 20:55:43,wallstreetbets,$120
2021-05-14 00:43:35,wallstreetbets,I'd DCA from $400 to however low it goes.
2021-05-13 20:55:53,wallstreetbets,$120
2021-05-13 20:04:13,wallstreetbets,But would you pay for the privilege?

2021-05-13 21:47:48,wallstreetbets,They always buy and sell to keep it at 10% weight. That's the only criteria that matters to evaluate ARK's position.
2021-05-13 21:39:34,wallstreetbets,"I don,t"
2021-05-13 23:34:07,wallstreetbets,"*our eyes connect from across a crowded room and suddenly you hear my voice in your head* ‚ÄúBatteries, dude.. batteries..‚Äù"
2021-05-13 21:09:50,wallstreetbets,I think Musk built up too much ill will and it's coming back on him now along with the shorts
2021-05-13 21:46:00,wallstreetbets,Good move. Just think if everyone on WB sold there Tesla shares how many AMC we could buy.
2021-05-13 22:25:49,wallstreetbets,You lost me at Uber
2021-05-13 21:09:11,wallstreetbets,"Bill hwang staked the first 4 ark etfs. They pray together. Ark etfs make up massive % in many of their stocks.

2021-05-13 23:24:52,wallstreetbets,I'm not buying tesla until I see rednecks hoarding AA batteries in plastic bags thinking they're going to profit off of electric cars.
2021-05-13 23:31:56,wallstreetbets,"I don't think Tesla is going anywhere, but as the years go on, they will no longer hold their competitive advantage in the electric vehicle market.

The reality is, the competition is starting to catch up. While I HATE the new Mustang Mach-E, it is getting rave reviews and the one thing that consistently stands out from the reviews is that it is a better built, better handling, and overall more usable car than any Tesla.

The Porsche Taycan is a significantly better car than a Model S in almost every conceivable manner. Fit and finish is superior, the handling and driving characteristics are on par with what you expect from a Porsche, and the car can repeatedly perform throughout the day unlike a Tesla which battery won't allow it to stay at peak performance past a few laps/hot runs.  


EDIT: Downvote away people, I understand there are a lot of Tesla fanboys on here, and thats fine. But do even a modicum of research on the car market and you will see that Tesla does not provide a good product when compared to the competition."

Even if there was nothing but good news, TSLA would be a hard sell. The price isn't justified, it hasn't been justified for a long time."

2021-05-14 02:35:39,wallstreetbets,"I'd really like to know what specific technology Telsa has that's seen as being exclusive to them and light years ahead of their competitors.To their benefit (and possible detriment in the long haul) they have taken great tech that's out there and been early adopters for mass produced vehicles. That tech isn't unique to them. For batteries they're using Panasonic cells with no exclusivity. The 2170 is widely available to the point where Samsung is competing with Panasonic for the largest shares of the market. VW will be using the 4680 and it will very likely also be used by Nio. Audi, BMW, and Ford/Lincoln are all advancing quickly with their autonomous driving functionality, and solutions like Baidu's Apollo open up that tech to any auto maker who wants to outsource that tech (cheaper Chinese auto manufacturers). Honestly the most advanced autonomous vehicle tech right now isn't what you're seeing any of these companies or Tesla use in passenger cars, it's what's being used in park shuttles that rolled out this past year or so. As for controls, Tesla's touchscreens are great when they work and when you're parked or don't need to do something multiple taps deep into the menu. Competitors sticking more to tactical tech for controls isn't really a bad thing as long as those control work, their more common issues are a slow experience in using touch screens for accessory & luxury controls."
2021-05-13 21:36:58,wallstreetbets,GME and AMC far better buys

That might be some kind of digital video-game purchasing system, like Apple's (AAPL) App Store or Valve's Steam. Additionally, some hope the company will pivot into popular online gaming streaming. Amazon.com (AMZN) is finding success there with its Twitch online service.
The company sell more shares and used the proceeds to cut its $216 million in long-term debt. That debt carried a costly 10% interest rate and matured in 2023.


Love a company thats debt free

>Shorting activity is down sharply ‚Äî as short sellers see the risk of their moves and pull back. Shorts only control 15% of GME stock now, says S&P Global Market Intelligence, down from roughly 90% in early 2021.


>the situation changed dramatically earlier on this year when a Reddit fuelled short squeeze sent its shares soaring and helped the company in raising as much as $551 million in the form of fresh capital by selling only 3.5 million units.

Fresh injection of capital helped the company in clearing its long-term debt and gave it the platform for long-term growth. More importantly, it is also necessary to point out that in 2020, GameStop had managed to grow its e-commerce business by as much as 191% and that is something that the company is likely to look into in its future growth plans.
On the other hand, the GME stock is pretty cheap at the moment and trades at only 2.26 times its revenues.

Amazon or other ecommerce stocks trade at much much higher multiples.

2021-05-14 06:50:26,wallstreetbets,"Well, this January Tesla's market share dropped down to 3.5% for that month. Tesla tends to underperform at the beginning of the year but that seems significant regardless, 96.5% of the EVs sold in the EU in January were not Tesla vehicles. Plus PSA, Citroen and Fiat Chryslter have merged in Stellantis. From my perspective, I think there's going to start getting more and more media hype against Tesla because of their poor performance in the European market (typical doom and gloom stuff, but Tesla has a lot of emotional investors).  


Now VW's major break through will probably start to emerge in the 6-18 month timeline, probably seeing a series of increases. There's a McKinsey report from like, 2018 on the Chinese automobile market which basically shows a major preference for German brands over any other nationality, including American. VW already has big ICE market share and production actually started in December for their ID.6 SUV in China and by the end of the year they're expecting to have aroudn 600,000 units in annual production and 1,000,000 by 2022.

People in Spain cant even run air conditioners because electricity is so expensive.

also, their bill is for 2040.  you really want to make an investment based on a law 20 years out, that could easily be changed, and for a country of just 40 million people, with negative gdp growth, and the second worst unemployment in the EU?  You don't think changes might happen in 20 years in EU as their financial situation continues to worsen?

your average spanish person buys a used SEAT 4 cylinder and keeps it forever.  Repairs are in the hundreds, and even then hard to afford for them.

Can you imagine them having to fix something on a TSLA?  How much can the govt. subsidize electric cars when they are so broke?  Are people going to pay full price for pricey EVs?  at best they will be buying VW ID3 type cars."

2021-05-14 10:10:30,wallstreetbets,"Yes. You realize that $250k per year is still middle class, firstly?   


And secondly,  his father was rich. Do I think the rich have $28k lying around? Yes. Yes, I do.   


Do I think most mothers will fight tooth and nail to scrape up $10k for their kid at all costs? Yes, yes I do.  


I grew up with a fully disabled mother and a father working 60-70 hours every week as an electrician for a saw mill AND going full time to school (on loans). My sister's liver failed without cause (and she's in textbooks for it). Over $100k in medical expenses later, she lived. So my dad spent 5 years finishing college while working himself to death to take care of us. We were lower middle class by total income, but adjusted income due to medical bills for mom and my sister put us solidly in the poor category. When I got the opportunity to go with People to People as a student ambassador? A nearly $5000 venture? They found a way, which I'm sure included loans. That's what parents DO, bud.   


And that's why I've spent my adult life making sure to do things for them, even though they're in a much better financial situation now (dad finished his electrical engineering degree summa cum laude and has consistently moved up in jobs). I came from that situation and finished my aerospace engineering degree with a top aerospace school, on loans with $80k in debt coming out. I've consistently moved up.

Thursday 6:45 PM

70F Sunset, Clear skies

Achieving a state of sanguineness does not require irrational ebullience or a leap of faith. Sometimes all that is required is a pragmatic and probabilistically reasoned exercise of courage - both an acknowledgement of the many hurdles that lie ahead, but also the very intentional choice to acquire the composure, caution, and courage to alter those circumstances so that probability is weighted in your favor - essentially making the choice to brave that journey towards nirvana. Inspiration can be fickle, circumstances volatile, and faith fleeting, but habits are steady. Progress can be made incrementally, bounded by fear on one end and procrastination on the other, ensuring it is always steady and never rushed.

My knight /u/memetron9000 shall remain by my side through this journey, flanked by /u/sloptart69 and /u/angrysc0tsman12 as my men at arms, with nary a doubt in our minds on our path to nirvana."

2021-05-13 20:50:00,wallstreetbets,"I have a question.   

GME went up a lot today.  Volume was 4.5 million shares higher than past 10 days.  Was this a liquidation of a short position (the sharp spike must have been)?  Was it driven by algos on the back of AMC? Do the algos just keep it after they buy it (4.5 x $160 = $720 million)?   Does it have to do with hedge fund margin calls due to declines of other assets (this is what I think)."

2021-05-14 02:12:20,wallstreetbets,They slowed down printing the cards when the pandemic hit because they weren‚Äôt sure how demand would be impacted. Demand skyrocketed when people were stuck inside and got stimulus checks to spend on nostalgic cardboard. Now they can‚Äôt even ramp up the printers fast enough to meet the demand for new sets. They gotta call JPOW for some technical assistance

2021-05-13 21:49:45,wallstreetbets,It's not inflation the market fears. It's what the federal reserve will do in response to inflation --- raise interest rates. The market is pricing in a high interest rate environment. That would explain bank stocks going up
2021-05-13 21:53:56,wallstreetbets,Except that interest rates would rise.

It‚Äôs the original play, while AMC was what people rushed to after they felt they missed out on the ride up while looking for high short interest stocks to ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$DGX suddenly a PRIME Short Squeeze candidate DD Congrats to those who have made some tendies following my previous $DGX DDs series over the past 3 months (see post history). Although the returns have already been excellent, I stumbled across some additional data over the past 48hrs that make $DGX Quest Diagnostics even more enticing. Astonishingly, short interest has TRIPLED recently. No, this isn't your 50%+ short **obvious** short squeeze play, but hear me out. This short interest is a suicide play that's flying under the radar.

* $DGX is a relatively low volume stock. Hence this tripling of short interest has resulted in a Days to Cover ratio of 8.6. For perspective (**not** to disparage these plays), Days to Cover is below 1 for both GME and AMC.
* 8.6 Days to Cover is ABSURDLY high for a safe blue chip stock with elite financials and tons of cash on hand. Again, for even more perspective, close competitor $LH Labcorp sits at 1.9.
* Now here's the icing on the cake. The cherry on top. The tug after the massage:
   * **93% of $DGX float is owned by institutions**. After recent buybacks, their float presently sits at 130m shares, 121m of which is owned by institutions.
      * Vanguard is the largest holder. Blackrock recently increased their large stake as well. Safe dividend stock = low churn from institutions. They hold.
   * $DGX recently approved $1.5 billion ASR (accelerated share repurchase), meaning they are GUARANTEED to repurchase nearly 10% of float by Q4: roughly 10 to 11 MILLION shares.

**Napkin crayon math:** Present float of 130m LESS low churn institutional holdings = ""Retail"" is playing with 10m shares. The ASR alone requires the repurchasing of 10 million shares. Now add in that short interest recently spiked to 11 million shares.

**Result (TL;DR):** Assuming institutions continue to mostly hold this safe dividend, blue chip stock with incredibly strong financials and a mountain of cash on hand, the $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase alone would propel this stock upwards. Throw the massive short interest spike on top and $DGX can rocket. This is honestly one of the dumbest short positions I've ever come across in the market. It is a suicide mission with high risk, minimal reward ($130 is rock bottom floor for this stock). It's so irrational that when I first saw it 2 days ago, I assumed it was a typo. It's too large to simply be a hedge. See DDs for non short interest related analysis.

2021-05-13 22:23:01,wallstreetbets,Fee to borrow is only 0.3% tho (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/DGX) which means the shorts can hold their position for a long ass time since they‚Äôre not paying much interest.

2021-05-14 03:55:05,wallstreetbets,Those squeezes already happened tho lol
2021-05-13 22:59:15,wallstreetbets,"True, but I figure the borrow fees each broker uses should be in the same ballpark since they should be based on the risk associated with shorting each stock. Unless their risk models are super different I‚Äôd expect them to be pretty similar. But yeah, could be wrong."
2021-05-13 20:29:16,wallstreetbets,"I checked just now and it's at $137 AH, which is pretty close to their ATH. I'm not against believing there's runway here, or that the company is putting shorters in a tough place with a buyback, but $130 being rock bottom seems optimistic."
2021-05-13 21:51:36,wallstreetbets,"If you disagree, then you expect this stock to trade well below 10 P/E for an **extended** period of time. Which as I pointed out in my previous DDs, has never happened in the past decade+."

2021-05-14 04:48:08,wallstreetbets,it's rare to see theta gang strats applied in WSB. Luckily for us you bet against AMC during an uptrend and got massively fucked. DAMN greeding for premium is a bitch huh?
2021-05-14 03:33:48,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm surprised they don‚Äôt allow it. Even if you ask for the ability to?
2021-05-14 12:10:22,wallstreetbets,Lol good luck asking RH for anything that isn't already built into the app by default.
2021-05-14 12:20:03,wallstreetbets,Not what I meant. Most brokerages you‚Äôre required to ask for different option levels and you have to answer questions related to your goals and option trading experience.

2021-05-14 03:23:43,wallstreetbets,I'm suspicious that they may be slowly covering their positions to manageable levels and that that's the only reason the stock is holding the price its been for the last month. If thats true it could never squeeze and just slowly bleed forever.

2021-05-14 02:48:25,wallstreetbets,"I seriously doubt the Real Economy would collapse no matter how high the price goes, unless there is a major credit crunch because all the big banks got caught with toxic shorts, and the DTCC has been passing rules left right and centre to protect themselves and their members, Hedge funds are just not as important as they want everyone to believe. the clearing houses are somewhat important but there are rules to deal with continuity should they go bankrupt and the federal reserve is obligated to bailout the central clearinghouse to prevent the aforementioned credit crunch. Hyperinflation is a possibility but unlikely the Fed has been printing Dollars like maniacs for years and there's been barely any inflation what's a few more. And if there is an inflation issue then it's on congress to front up and pass a sensible budget that sucks the extra money out of the system.

And the SEC and the Fed have had since February to wind this situation up while it was small and everyone was happy to settle for $1k but they allowed shocking amounts of criminal behaviour to blow the whole crisis beyond all reason now people smell blood and like the taste. 

In the end we will see whether the US economy collapses or not when the bomb goes off."

It's just a number to hype people up but the share holders are going to want the best price they can get for it be it $1000 per share or $1000000000 a share or wherever it falls inbetween.

Besides whether there's enough money in the world to pay is academic, a cash and carry doesn't worry where the money comes from so long as the customer pays for the goods, assuming the scale of the looming disaster is as bad as suggested the Fed will and has to print enough to cover the cost or face a liquidity crisis the likes it has never seen, a catastrophic loss in investor confidence in the US market, or will have to negotiate a settlement, or a combination of factors."

2021-05-14 10:20:41,wallstreetbets,"The full story is too long, but let's just say that the rocket launching to the moon is probably a much smoother ride than GME has been for me. Those shares were purchased around $120-$160, but due to prior losses it assigned a wash sale cost basis of $591.6661. I learned accounting from Dumb-n-Dumber, and just keep a sticky note reminding myself this is my future beach house."
2021-05-14 03:25:56,wallstreetbets,Damn dude somehow sold for a loss then bought back in writhing 30 days and sold for a loss again. Tuff

2021-05-14 14:01:33,wallstreetbets,I saw a video of this. Guy buys when it rises and sells when it goes down. Hilarious
2021-05-13 23:11:56,wallstreetbets,"Do you ever wonder if it's overvalued? Even at its best, $160/share is extreme for a company like GameStop. But $250+?! That's not counting the fact that GME short interest is down like 70%.

So my question is, did you do any DD of your own or are you just blindly hoping for the best?"
2021-05-14 00:09:15,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs the basis of my decision - I don‚Äôt want to work until I‚Äôm old.  I like the stock that much.

2021-05-13 23:36:55,wallstreetbets,"With GameStop, you just don‚Äôt know.

Literally a week later it was back at $250+ again.

There is no rhyme or reason when it comes to this stock. It can explode at any time, but I agree, it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd risk my retirement money on."
2021-05-14 00:01:34,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve done an immense amount of DD - and I like the stock. :)
2021-05-14 12:54:28,wallstreetbets,"Don't sit here and act live the value of gme is obvious. Nobody fucking knows. I've heard $10,000 said seriously and $1 said seriously. And it's been up and down several times between $300 and $40.

2021-05-14 04:52:05,wallstreetbets,Stop pretending the value of a stock is tied only to the company's profits.

2021-05-13 21:08:18,wallstreetbets,Fears are overblown. The Chinese government crackdown on monopolies was a slap on the wrist. Jack Ma is fine. Not even close to what Microsoft went through for its monopolistic activities in the US. The US media fear mongering on China is pretty toxic. 19 forward P/E. 64% revenue growth last year and good guidance for this year. Insane growth. EPS miss due to a one time fine by the government.

2021-05-14 04:09:27,wallstreetbets,"They missed the adjusted earnings by a bit. The net loss was caused by the fine, though. Cloud growth also missed expectations because they lost one of their biggest customers due to political risk associated with China. E commerce slightly underperformed, although it is hard to say why exactly until we see other Chinese e commerce names report earnings.

That being said, I still think it‚Äôs a strong buy at this price."

You know how a casino is a literal casino?

The market is a casino but instead of being a literal casino it's figurative.

Do you understand now? 

Lmk if it still doesn't make sense and I'll try to explain it a different way for you. 

You know how the casino is a business? That's the stock market. The market is run by for profit private banks who control the market and thus make it. 

Like a casino where you place bets on outcomes out of your control in the market you also place bets on outcomes that are out of control. 

In a casino you have games of chance to bet on. 

In the market you have stocks to bet on. 

The difference is that the casino is an independent third party that enforces the rules IMPARTIALLY and fairly in games players play against other players. 

The government is the house, an independent third party tasked with enforcing the rules, law impartially and fairly in a market where you place bets on companies. 

In a casino the dealer works for the house and is independent of the players with 0 stakes in the game. 

The dealer is the market maker in the market. 

The market maker is also a player though and thus when they deal they deal better hands to themselves, the player, than you their opponent. 

In poker you all get the same information in real time at the same time. 

In the market the dealer shuffles the deck and plays the cards that benefit them as they know all the hands other players hold. 

When you the player call the house over to enforce the rules of the Casino they laugh at you and say ""the dealer is a professional what did you expect?""

Do you understand now? 

The market is a casino.

The casino is a casino. 

You have better odds in a casino than you do in the market. 

Lmk if you still can't understand that the market is a casino and all the games are rigged against you. The games are operated by the players you bet against as they are the dealer and control which cards get played when etc. 

Hopefully you understand now. 

Invest in SPY as you can't beat the market. 

Why can't you best the market? Because it's rigged silly. 

When the casino loses too much they can ban you from playing. 

When the market makers lose too much they can ban you from playing, like they did.

You called the house over to instruct the dealer to play fairly and the house laughed at you. 

Hope this helps you understand how the figurative casino is like the literal casino only literal casinos are fair and impartial. üòò"

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"V2G, a Long-term EV Energy Infrastructure Play # About the Grid and V2G

Like any other commodity, the price of electricity constantly fluctuates in accordance with supply and demand. However, unlike most commodities, electricity is not cheaply storable. This causes a huge inefficiency for electricity providers because they must develop enough power plants to meet peak power demand. Building new power plants is incredibly capital intensive and a poor use of capital if those plants are only needed for a few hours per day, week, or month during high load events. Instead, utilities are incentivized to ""flatten the curve"" of electricity demand and keep their capital investment in new power plants low. Historically, prices to consumers have been fixed with time of day fluctuations built into the calculation, but smart meters and deregulation have led to more states offering real-time pricing. [source](https://extension.psu.edu/real-time-pricing-for-electricity). This creates opportunity.

It's a load balancing problem. Power plants can supply all the necessary power if demand is spread uniformly, but when everyone wants that power from 4PM-8PM on a hot summer day, it's a problem and black-outs occur.

Enter V2G. Why let any asset sit idle when it could be making you money? Rather than turning your EV into a robo-taxi when you're not using it, here's a simpler idea: leverage the most valuable component of the EV, the battery. Grid operators will pay to rent your energy storage and use your car's battery as a ""virtual power plant"" to meet peak demand.

# The future of the grid

Green energy like solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of electricity generation in most parts of the world ([Bloomberg 2019 Energy Outlook](https://www.enelgreenpower.com/media/news/2019/07/bloomberg-new-energy-outlook-2019)). Yet, passive green energy generation varies depending on conditions and cannot respond to greater demand like a traditional power station. Additionally, electricity demand will continue to grow with the population and EV ownership. By 2035, an estimated 50% of ALL cars will be electric ([Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ninety-percent-of-u-s-cars-must-be-electric-by-2050-to-meet-climate-goals/)). Adding more battery storage to the grid is part of the solution.

# Hurdles

**Plug problems**

There are 2 dominant fast charging plugs used for EV's: CHADeMO and CCS (adapters between the two are not possible). In North America and Europe, CCS has become and will continue to be the  standard, but it does not yet support bidirectional charging which is projected for 2025 ([Inside EVs](https://insideevs.com/news/342354/charin-ccs-combo-standard-to-offer-v2g-by-2025/)).

CHADeMO does support bidrectional charging and has decent coverage across the globe, but it's dying everywhere outside of Japan. There are a couple mass market CHADeMO vehicles on the market, notably the Nissan Leaf, but it's difficult for people to justify buying V2G equipment right now because changing from a CHADeMO to CCS vehicle would render the V2G equipment useless.

Tesla. In the US, Tesla uses a proprietary plug for fast-charging instead of the CCS standard they have shifted towards in most other markets. Tesla is the single largest EV maker, so their proprietary plug poses problems for a V2G future. Tesla would need to be willing to enable bidirectional charging on their fleet and potentially canabilize their Powerwall business.

**Battery degradation.**

All studies I've seen suggest this is minimal ([source](https://youtu.be/QKg_GWDogFc?t=420)). Advancing technology in accordance with Wright's law ([source](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/electric-vehicle-battery-prices-fall/)) should bring larger, cheaper, more resilient batteries, so long-term, I do not expect this to be an issue.

**Battery capacity and user error**

Let's say you're a 9-5 wage slave. You plug in your vehicle at 5:30 and it starts powering your house to offset peak power prices. But, a couple hours later you decide you want to go out only to discover your vehicle has lost 10+ kWH powering your house. Obviously, this defeats the purpose of such a system. There are 2 solutions to this.

1. Press a button on the V2G equipment that will keep your car charging instead of discharging on days when you may go out.
2. Get a car with a large enough battery that it practically has no effect. If your car doubles as a home battery backup, it makes sense to spend the extra money on this and benefit from the greater range. It's beautiful - wait for it - synergy.

**Regulation**

Back in 2016, Tesla's chief technology office said battery degradation and regulation were the 2 largest risks ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzAPyk8Wbhk&t=219s)). I don't disagree about regulation. This is where V2H makes a lot of sense. Getting permission from numerous different regulatory agencies sounds like a bureaucratic nightmare.

It's feasible because it's essentially the same scenario as someone with solar panels that feed back into the grid. Yet, we still see nightmare cases like Bill Maher who waited over 1,000 days to get regulatory approval for solar panels.

Fortunately, V2H is plenty profitable and should require less regulation since you would not feed power back into the grid. I plugged in my own home energy usage and found I could decrease my ""capacity charge"" on my electric bill from $50/month to $0/month if my vehicle powers my house everyday from 4-6 PM during typical peak demand and then recharge late at night using practically free electricity.

# Conclusion

At present, EV buyers are generally wealthier and more educated. So, they are likely to adopt V2G/V2H because the math works out. It's a low risk investment with consistent returns via savings on energy bills. The only issue? There's no V2G product available on the US market, yet. You want to extract as much value from a depreciating asset like a vehicle as fast as possible because advancing technology makes your vehicle more obsolete everyday. If battery degradation is minimal, as evidence suggests, then it's only logical to enroll your vehicle into V2G and extract maximum value from it with minimal inconvenience.

CHADeMO vehicles have served as the guinea pigs. They have shown the feasibility of V2G. Utilities have partnered with private companies even with residential customers ([residential experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7h9EecmLatY&)). Now, it's a matter of waiting for CCS to achieve bidirectional charging, waiting for enough vehicles to proliferate, and then the V2G payday will come.

2021-05-13 21:55:43,wallstreetbets,You got a 1.
2021-05-13 22:58:01,wallstreetbets,"You apparently haven't been paying attention Pltr has gotten crushed.  It can't go much lower. Fsly been crushed, ZM, Roku, Pton etc.  Most of thelat speculative tech has already been beaten down.

I would actually look at retail and other recover stocks that are sitting at ATH.  WSM and RH are great examples.  Way over valued. They went straight up the last 4 months. WSM literally went up 90%. Already have Puts on both. RH up like 65% and WSH up 12% today."
2021-05-13 21:56:49,wallstreetbets,"Ooof, critical fail... Hooo boy, what's the damage?"
2021-05-13 23:00:07,wallstreetbets,"The stocks are no where near where they were pre covid. They can go down a lot more before going up. Pltr was $9 a year ago and is $18 right now, it can easily see $15-$13 soon in the short term. I have a small position in it, my major put was in roblox and MVIS."
2021-05-14 00:24:44,wallstreetbets,"Fair value of Pltr is about $22. We are already getting down into a liquidation valuenof cash and assets right now.

Many of the tech companies have valid financials to support a higher valuation.  Amd for example increased yoy Q1 revenue 93% and profit over 180% yet the price is low $70s.  They are eating Intc lunch in consumer products and data centers and starting to get into Nvda space with GPUs etc."
2021-05-14 07:36:23,wallstreetbets,"Given all the SBC the company hands out alongside options/warrants exercisable, lots of dilution available in the company. 

300 million in exercisable stock options ITM 
535 million available 

Obviously using the treasury stock method reduces those numbers, but doubt that inflow of cash will have Palantir doing buybacks."
2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"An honest question with reasons below. Why is anyone supporting AMC? The effort to stick it to the hedge funds was a great cause especially for GME but WSB's purpose for AMC is one that allowed execs from AMC to take clear advantage of everyone on WSB. 

In February, AMC top executives took bonuses of $8.3 million (literally for carrying them through the pandemic, which is interesting because they shutdown operations and made near zero income. Zero! So exactly how did they carry the company through the pandemic?). Yet WSB comes along and catapults the stock value so now these clowns are worthy of million dollar bonuses? This is no different than the banks taking TARP $ in 2008-09 and were instructed by the Fed to loan $ out to consumers but instead paid massive bonuses to themselves. Doesn't any of this anger anyone? It does me, I'm seriously pissed. 

Don't believe me, check it out: 

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amc-entertainment-awards-ceo-adam-aron-3-75m-bonus 

Even worse, NOW executive compensation has exploded. When movie theaters closed in March 2020 as the coronavirus took hold, AMC‚Äôs top executives including Aron agreed to cut their cash salary by 15% and decrease other compensation over three years (which is noble) in exchange for stock that will only vest if the price doubles or triples. (Uh, that would be fair if they championed the turnaround in the stock, which they didn't do, WSB did). 

See how that worked out? WSB saved the company (which is great because going to the movies is practically a need in life along with food, shelter and clothing). But again, the executives had zero involvement with the performance of the stock, ZERO. WSB is what championed this turnaround making the executive compensation pathetic.  So now what? Sell? Hold or something else? Either way, why was this company supported from the beginning?

2021-05-14 04:36:47,wallstreetbets,"account made on march 19th 2021, get out of here you spy"
2021-05-14 02:11:19,wallstreetbets,"Back in march earnings calls. It was reported that only 1-5% of what the cash they received was from the stock price.

I wouldn't call a stock that's been at around 10 dollars a stock that ""soared"". Gme is the one that soared. AMC is still currently undervalued compared to pre 2020 levels. 

But all this doesn't matter, I'm personally not investing in AMC because of business practices. I'm here for the squeeze. Don't really care how they use the money."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$AMD is undervalued and will steadily grow to $100+ by Q4. Tech sector ie (QQQ) was among the best performing index‚Äôs for the past decade and covid only accelerated that sentiment. That sentiment will likely continue due to younger money growing with time. 

Micro Chips are needed more than ever. Ie Autos, Cloud, Block chain, Energy. 

AMDs big shift (2017) was to outsource foundry and bring in Taiwan base wafers which is highlighted as AMDs biggest successful move. 

AMD has commented in the latest ER that the chip shortage in the media is not going to affect their output. They have the strongest relationship with TSM and internally Lisa Su knows she will have dibs. This is a key foundation for AMD which is affecting two of their biggest lines (profit margin via cheap chips, and capacity not being affected as TSM is going to ship as many chips as AMD needs)

AMD has grown in double digits for the past 3 years. Ie QoQ growth, YoY growth, further, gross profit remains intact and will likely not change as TSM is their horse. Every earnings forecast is revised up. Expecting more double digit growth for the foreseeable future. 

With AMD stock price going down, current PE stands at ~30. This is very low for any tech sector stock, especially one that is expecting large growth in an industry that will only grow. PE will continue to drop if AMD stays flat or drops in stock price. They will continue to grow revenue exponentially which will also cause PE to drop."

2021-05-13 21:56:52,wallstreetbets,"You need big air or a 240mm aio for 5800x and above. They seem to base their max clock speeds off of a 70c temp. Also find the negative offset in curve optimizer for your particular chip. That will reduce temps and increase clock speeds. My 5600x runs the coolest at around 60c under a 240 aio in a cooler master nr200p case. 5800x was toasty with peaks up to 80c under a 240 aio and no curve optimization. Replaced it with a 5900x that runs around 70c under a 360 aio while rendering with a -10 offset on the curve optimizer. Clock speeds are at 4.3ghz all core. While gaming with same settings, my temps are about 60-65c but it boosts to 4.75ghz all core with peaks of 5.15ghz.

2021-05-13 20:04:05,wallstreetbets,"To overly simplify it. A calls premium goes up in value if the underlying asset increases in value and if the Implied Volatility or IV goes up then it increases in value even more. 

A call gives you the right to buy 100 shares per contract purchased at the strike price by a certain date. Once the date is reached, then the call is automatically exercised or sold (if you don‚Äôt have the funds to purchase 100 shares of the underlying asset). Most people never exercise calls though, and instead choose to ‚Äúbuy to close‚Äù to either realize a profit or stop a loss before the expiration date.

A put gives you the right to sell 100 shares of a stock at the strike price by the date specified in the contract. Everything above applies to a put except that a puts premium goes up in value if the underlying asset decreases in value. 

Buying a put is NOT shorting a stock.

Options are actually quite complicated too. They decrease in value over time due to Theta and the rate of decay increases tenfold as the expiration date approaches. I would suggest not trading options until you do some of your own research and then give it a go with a dollar amount you are OK with losing before you try it out. 

You can realize massive gains with options; however, it is also much easier to lose all your money trading them too. With stocks, you can hold them forever and most likely it will eventually be profitable. Options do not have this luxury. They can expire out of the money completely worthless and leave you penniless on the trade"

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Redfin (RDFN) Severely Undervalued with Great Catalysts Hello Fellow Autists,

The residential real estate market is booming. REITS are too boomer for you, so you look for growth plays to play real estate. Redfin (RDFN) is a play that is greatly undervalued.  

**What is Redfin?** Redfin is a residential real estate brokerage. The company uses technologies such as map search and virtual house showings to increase exposure, improve the quality of the customer experience, all while delivering efficiencies and saving the consumer costs. Redfin also provides the ability to do digital and online document management making it a one stop shop for one‚Äôs real estate needs. **Their mission is to redefine real estate in favor of the consumer. To change an industry that has had little disruption. Redfin's business model to undercut competition is based on sellers paying Redfin a discounted fee, either 1 or 1.5% to list the seller's home.**  

This company does it all, they will buy your house, sell your house, you can buy a house on it, get approved for a mortgage, get a mortgage, or even hire a concierge service to get your home ready for people to view it in person or online. Your wife's boyfriend can take care of all his real estate needs and finally get you a house to you don't have to ask him if you can turn on the AC at night. Think of this company as a potential amazon of real estate and nobody does what they do.

In the past few years Redfin has had crazy growth, in 2019 alone they had over 60% revenue growth and during the quarter of COVID lockdowns they sustained over 4% growth compared to that quarter last year which is crazy because everybody was under lockdown. 

&#x200B;

Recently the company lost over 30% of its share value after earnings per share miss (They beat revenue estimates) and the Nasdaq brutality that has happened lately. They are currently trading at around 49-50 dollars a share as I write this, which is about a 5 billion dollar market cap. They are projected to have well over 5 billion dollars in revenue alone and be profitable in 2025. They will be profitable by end of 2021. This is a company that recently in 2016 only had about .33% of all the homes sold in North America, and now they have over 1% and growth will be exponential as they acquire more listing through their catalysts. I did a DCF analysis and the perpetuity approach price value of the stock using slightly bullish over consensus numbers was around 95$ per share. With sensitivity analysis the best case is around 150$ per share.  

**The investment thesis:** Redfin will trade higher through the catalysts of **surging real estate prices** due to people moving out of cities due to Covid, inflation, interest rates, and the general economy booming right now, the **acquisition of Rentpath**, and the **expansion of RedfinNow program**. Plus the company right now is way undervalued and is a steal. 

Real Estate Industry Outlook: 

 In 2020, Redfin accounted for 1.00% of total home sales, leaving much more room for redfin to acquire market share 

‚Ä¢ 8% estimate rise in real estate sales in 2021, which will benefit Redfin‚Äôs business

‚Ä¢ As home prices rise, the profits for Redfin rise as well

‚Ä¢ During 2020, revenue in the real estate market hit $33.6 trillion

‚Ä¢ Over the last 10 years, mortgage rates have declined by \~2.42%, benefiting residential real estate

Essentially real estate is booming, and Redfin was already in hyper growth mode before COVID. 

&#x200B;

**Expansion of RedfinNow**

This is a newer program and they are committed to growing it recently adding San Francisco to territory this program exists. RedfinNow is a great way to liquidate your home with a cash offer from Redfin. You get a no-obligation offer in a few days. Close on your schedule, and move when you're ready. This is helping them get more listings because in this industry more listings makes you get more views and Redfin is already the most visited online brokerage by a lot. This will add to their exponential growth of their business and as long as they buy the houses for dirt cheap they will also churn out good profit on them. This is their number one growing segment of revenue.

&#x200B;

**Acquisition of Rentpath** 

In February, Redfin moved into the rental industry, acquiring RentPath for $608 Million.

\-RentPath has more than 20,000 apartment buildings on its rental websites, and grew its traffic more than 25% last year

\-One in five  of Redfin‚Äôs 40+ million monthly visitors also wants to see homes for rent

\-Redfin plans to have all of Rentpath‚Äôs listing on their own website by 2022, the partnership will allow for: 

\- Better Search Experience

\- Better Value for Advertisers

\-Higher Traffic Growth

\-And open up to a younger customer base as many younger people want to see rentals because they are not in a position to buy a house whether it be because of finances, job, etc. 

&#x200B;

**Summarization:** Redfin is extremely undervalued where it is at right now and is a steal. The company has no competitor that does what they do. Zillow only makes its money from advertising while Redfin has all sorts of revenue segments that are diverse. The real estate market outlook that has been brought on by Covid took this already crazy growth company pulled it back a little in a slingshot and let it rip. Throw in RedfinNow and Rentpath and this company is going to be a terror for other companies to deal with. This is a great long term play and longer dated call options are going to be great. At the end of the day redfin is a company for the consumer and saves them lots of money while they make money. you can save up to 40k selling a million dollar house on their website. That's a lot of money to use on some  FD's.

2021-05-14 09:40:34,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea how to play options, care to explain in more detail üëÄ?"
2021-05-14 12:48:21,wallstreetbets,"There are a lot of ways to play options.  Selling covered calls is one of the least risky, but it can print money over the long term.

A call is a contract between the seller and the buyer, where up until an agreed upon date (expiration date), the buyer has the right / option to buy 100 shares of the stock from the seller at an agreed upon price (strike price).  A covered call is just a call where the seller of the contract is already holding the shares to meet their obligation should the buyer exercise the contract.

When you see what you think is an undervalued stock, a simple way to try to make money off of it is to buy it and set a limit sell for it to be sold when it reaches a price you think it should be at.

A way to potentially make more money is to buy the stock and sell weekly calls on it (option contracts that expire after one week, shortest term available) with the strike price being what you would have set for your limit sell.  That way you make exactly as much money as you would have just selling the stock at that limit price, but also whatever you happen to collect in premiums for selling call contracts on the shares in the time it takes the stock to reach that price.

Using UWMC as an example, one could buy and hold 100 shares and sell weekly $9 calls for something like $0.10/share, or $10/contract.  That doesn't sound like much, but it adds up, and when the stock reaches $9 and your call contract gets exercised by the buyer, you still take all of those gains up to the strike price as profits.

And consider this:  UWMC is considered to have a decent dividend for it's share price at $0.40/year, which is paid out as $0.10 each quarter (every 3 months).  Selling covered calls for $0.10/share pays you that dividend every week."

Actually, I think there still may be truth to the post. Maybe HF's are hiding SI, maybe my initial date was off and we are still prime for a squeeze soon.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But this post is not about gamestop. I am writing this post to answer a question that melvins bot asked me: How the actual fuck do you make money trading options and you don't know what ""writing a put"" means?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Well I do know what writing a put means, but I believe the newbies of WSB would like to hear my answer.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How do you make money in the stock market if you aren't a financial professional? The answer is simple: The Long/Short Portfolio

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What is Long/Short? The premise of a long/short portfolio is to be prepared for anything that could happen in the market. Even the best traders in the world can't guess and time every single economic event. The goal of the long/short is to have a portfolio set up that can make money in any market. The most basic long/short combination is SPY/VIX. If you compare the charts, they are pretty much exact inverses of each other. Because of this, you can protect yourself against a market crash.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To give an example of how I use the SPY/VIX, I had spy investments that were up 25% around the 13th of april. My belief is that gamestop will squeeze soon, and when it does, the rest of the market will sell off. To act on this belief, I pulled most of my gains out of the spy and slightly increased my position in the VIX. This ""reaction"" can be triggered by your personal beliefs in the market, gamestop was just an example. If you only purchase the vix when it is near an all time low, and never purchase the spy at an all time high, you will have a foolproof hedge\* Not to mention, the vix does not just pop on devastating market events. Normal corrections can be profited from through the vix. As you can see, this set up is made for protection. For example, if you were invested in the VIX and S&P before the covid crash, your vix investment would have increased just as much as your spy decreased. If you sold your vix, and waited a year, your spy would be back to it's previous value, and you would pocket the profit from the vix.

\*Foolproof as in one investment will hedge the other. A 50/50 vix spy split will not be profitable.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are many ways to set up a long/short portfolio. SPY/VIX is the simplest, and probably the least profitable because it is created for this very reason. Perhaps an investor could find cyclical stocks that benefit from the others loss, and use that as a long/short. It's also possible to find cyclical stocks that are at a very low price, and hedge with more mainstream investments/tools, just like a certain DFV. It's ok to gamble on meme stocks as long as your portfolio has a long/short backbone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All in all, it is not possible to guess everything that will happen. So how do good traders make money even if they don't understand the exact intricacies and implications of options, or even economic functions in general? Long/short. They don't know everything. They just use the tools available to them to be prepared for everything.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok cool lots of talk about strategy but this is WSB and you're here for options. So how do you use long/short with options? Invest the exact same way a boomer would, but with leaps. What is the difference between parking your spare cash in S&P shares vs S&P leap calls for 2 years? If you are an active investor, there is no difference in risk. I would

argue that through periodic vix investments, it is even less risky then letting your cash sit in shares. The benefit is that the return of the leap S&P options will return much more profit then the shares.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: I'm not responsible for any money you lose. And please, if you don't know options, research a lot before playing with them. From personal experience, it is very very easy to lose money. If you want to practice the long/short, use SPY/VIXY shares for a safer start. If you are new to investing in general, paper trade first.  This is my own approach to the market. I am sharing it because I got my start in the market through WSB. This sub has cycles. It's normal for awhile, then a post hits the front page and there's a huge influx of noobs. Eventually, the words of the OGs get through to the noobs, and they learn the game. I think this new cycle has brought more newbies then the OGs can keep up with. So here's my advice, take it or leave it

It doesn't have to be as big as mine but if you're reading news 24/7, good at economics, excellent at reading patterns, competent with your technical analysis and ready to lose money, you'll make a great trader. Trading is an art that gets perfected over time. The day I started looking at money as just ""numbers"" and not something that can buy me things, I stopped making net losses. Psychology plays a colossal role. Avoid leveraging too much, it will be the death of you.

Also, never revenge trade. It was my biggest lesson. I wish I had more to give you but it is as simple as that. Sometimes the best way is the simplest.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PLTR: Two Huge Catalysts That No One is Talking About (DD) Credit to r/Ryanj928

Okay listen up Palantards. Within the next two weeks, we have the potential to see two contracts being awarded to Palantir that most likely will have bring in roughly $750 million or more to Palantir's total deal value. THIS IS HUGE! As of Q1 2021, Palantir's total deal value was $2.8 billion, so this potential deal value of $750 million would be 26.8% of Palantir's total deal value. This type of news brings further shock to the growth that Palantir is experiencing, and with their margins only getting better, this will drastically improve the cash flow of this company.

‚Äã

So what are the Catalysts?

1:) The FDIC's Rapid Phased Prototyping Competition - This competition was started in August of 2020 when the FDIC formally invited 33 companies to submit a concept that would help update the old, cumbersome software that FDIC banks were using to report information, financial risks, integrate data; All on a cloud-based platform that ultimately will host end-to-end supervision processes. Exactly what Palantir does. This competition has been ongoing, and Palantir, unsurprisingly, was selected as 1 out of the 11 finalists for the competition. These companies presented their last demo days in March, and one company is expected to get the contract that could run 7.5 years and total up to $487.5 million. This contract can be expanded into additional work, and could generate more revenue if Palantir is awarded the contract. Based off the FDIC's timeline for the RPP competition, it seems they are expecting to make a decision before the end of the month, since the competitors showed their final prototype back in mid-March and the timeline has been moving in two month intervals.

‚Äã

2:) The Renewal of the U.S. Special Operations Command Contract - This was previously Palantir's largest ever contract before the U.S Army contract in 2019. This contract was valued $277,500,00 and was a 5 year contract that was awarded in 2016 that is set to expire on May 25th. Based off Palantir's reputation in the DoD, its reasonable to say that Palantir is the best competitor for this project and will most likely be given a renewal contract by the U.S Special Ops Command. This renewal will most likely be a larger contract, due to natural COG rising and potential to be involved in other areas of software for the agency. But this contract will certainly be announced on/before May 25th and will be a huge number for investors to read. Although this is just a renewal, this is a HUGE renewal, one of their largest ever.

‚Äã

Conclusion: These two catalysts will provide a strong argument to showcase Palantir's dominance in data analytics, and show itself as the only competitor capable of handling data safely and efficiently in the world. I strongly believe that these two catalysts will be huge momentum for the company itself (not just the stock) and will further confirm our eventual destination to the moon. With Palantir finally getting passed the profitability marker, deals like this will cement that profitability and hurl it from being branded as an unprofitable, 17 year old company to one that is quickly increasing cash flow by the multiple. Those who are value traders/professionals and use models, you understand how this will change the stock price. This will be a once in a decade company and I fully am behind it.

My models currently show a $29 PT, but this number will greatly change within the next quarter, especially when inflation fears reside."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NRG Energy - a value trade with good fundamental and technical delta. NRG Energy ($NRG) ‚Äì A utility with millions of customers and a stupid cheap price to forward P/E of 5.82 and an even juicier price to free-cash-flow of 5.63. They also pay a 1.30 annual dividend which works out to 3.87%. In addition, every year since 2017 they have reduced their share count with buybacks,

NRG Energy is a very profitably utility that faced headwinds following their acquisition of Direct Energy which was involved in the winter storm that locked up a lot of Texas‚Äôs green energy sector. (Impact of it was $550 million.) This is minor in the scale of NRG‚Äôs revenue and their annual free-cash-flow.

Recent distribution of the stock has hit a point where I think the selling pressure is off. It has spent the last two weeks in a down-trend to based at support right around $33.35 This is a zone which held strong at several points this year.

Selling volume hit a relative high yesterday and if today‚Äôs volume comes in way light that will confirm an oversold condition and very likely start a counter-trend. (Moving back up.)

According to [Y-charts](https://ycharts.com/companies/NRG/stock_buyback) they started buying back shares again in the quarter ended in March. ($8 million worth.) If they hit the same numbers as 2020 they should buyback about $250 million before the end of the year.

The stock is trading in a sweet spot $4 below it‚Äôs 200-day moving average. As you can see from this 1-year weekly chart below. Even in March of 2020, the pandemic crash, it only stayed below the 200 for 8-weeks. In all other cases it was a 5-week or less time period. The current time below 200 is 4-weeks. (The green line is the 200 day moving average.)

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why Boomers and Millennials like $UWMC Boomers and Millennials agree on little nowadays. One is lazy, doesn't listen, already knows everything, and only thinks about themselves. The other are millennials. But $UWMC is a stock both can buy and hold for short term or long term. Here's why:

**The millennials case for $UWMC:**

Stock Deeply Undervalued: millennials love stocks that hedgies have (allegedly) artificially pushed down the price. UWM is a growing company and Wall Street has positioned itself as if UWM is shrinking.

Share Buybacks: millennials will recognize this buyback is different then say Apple. With $300 million in buybacks, UWM can reduce the whole float by almost 40%.

Option Open Interest: There are 131,934 open interest in options (as of this morning) with strikes at $10 and under. That is a lot of shares that the sellers of those options would need to find. The float could be reduced significantly by share buybacks at that time. Institutional investors easily control 20+million shares and they aren't selling at these prices. Gores holds 15.8m shares they bought for $10 a few months ago.

CEO: Mat is pissed Wall Street doesn't love his company as much as he does. He will do what it takes to get the price to what he needs it to be with the buybacks. He is game to play.

**The boomer case for $UWMC:**

Mortgages: Boomers love mortgages, the bigger the better. UWM is the largest wholesale mortgage provider in America. The mortgage industry isn't going anywhere and boomer's small brains can at least understand that.

Healthy Financials: UWM runs a tight ship and is very profitable. It also trades at a low P/E around 6 or so. Boomers love low P/E's cause they hate tech and tech is ""expensive"". They buy low P/E companies like T cause they are much smarter than millennials at investing.

Dividends: Boomers love dividends. They think it is free money. At a $7.5 stock price $UWMC pays a 5.3% dividend. But even better, UWM pays a dividend on its class A shares only. Class A is only 7% of the outstanding shares, so it costs UWM $42 million to pay a 5.3% dividend. For context, their net income Q1 was $800m+.

Share Buybacks: Boomers love getting their capital returned in a slow, and boring way. UWMC has a $300 million share buyback underway right now.

Mat Ishbia: Mat is a CEO boomers love. He played team sports and won an NCAA national championship riding the bench at Michigan State. Boomers love reading stories like that because they always preached hard work to their own kids from the couch.

So either a short term or long term investment, boomer or millenial, $UWMC looks interesting."
2021-05-14 00:35:53,wallstreetbets,I think this is the stock to own.  Rafi thinks this is headed to $20 soon if stars align.  Q1 was actually a beat not a miss.  Merger happened 1/3 of the way through the quarter but nobody is talking about that whatever.  Stock buybacks signal company is willing to defend it's sp so it is done going down now.  Cheers.  Lets get wsb behind it now and blow this small float out of the water.

2021-05-13 23:43:17,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm a millennial in with 2000 shares. I like the long term dividend/boomer argument as much as the millennial argument. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm at an $8.22 cost basis, but I already made a lot off the run up to $10 a few months ago, so I felt comfortable starting to buy back in the $8 range. I believe in the company, and I‚Äôm not sweating $1 too much

Selling options combined with the dividend for a few years will be pretty sweet, I think. A compounding interest type deal, unless my options get called. If they do though, that means I‚Äôm making good money anyways, as I‚Äôm selling well above my cost basis"

The love for thy neighbors. Leave no man behind. I see humanity could finally be breaking that chain. I pray for you all. This is our chance. Our once in a lifetime chance to have riches.

2021-05-13 22:28:38,wallstreetbets,It did a dip last week partially in response to it. The dilution is now priced in with the conclusion of the sale. And AMC is in a better financial position than it was before.

2021-05-14 01:32:58,wallstreetbets,"16.40$ here, when I got spammed for suggesting that I would buy at 12$, because apparently it was ""never going to drop below 15""."
2021-05-13 22:24:30,wallstreetbets,"Dilution; an at-the-market option allows AMC to create and sell it's own shares for cash in order to reinvest, pay off debts, and pay other current liabilities. By doing this, the amount of shares being sold causes the price of their share to decrease as they are offering more shares to buyers at market or lower cost. Because lower bid shares are being bought instead of higher bid limit orders, the price stays the same or drops.

The price can also drop as share dilution scares off investors who would rather have their money sit in stable or growth stocks, and it's a sign of weak free cash flow (which is to say, the business cannot cover current expenses easily or generate more of its own cash through investment)."
2021-05-14 00:24:56,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-05-13 20:14:41,wallstreetbets,Same lmao...
2021-05-14 00:05:31,wallstreetbets,"Me too bro ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry). You might have bought in pre-market like me, as that was the only time it went to 25. Only you and me might be aware of it as even the historical chart doesn‚Äôt show that price ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)"
2021-05-13 22:15:56,wallstreetbets,"No shame, congratulations on the house!"
2021-05-13 20:43:55,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt put a date on it.
2021-05-14 01:04:49,wallstreetbets,They did this a few months ago and it crashed the stock actually.  That's why everyone is bagholding $14 and $16 a share.

You guys gonna be bag holding soon when the sell offs start.."

2021-05-13 23:53:45,wallstreetbets,"Didn't they say they'd sign a contract that if given permission to issue a share dilution not a single share would be issued until 2022? This is shady AF, absolute contempt for their shareholders."
2021-05-14 05:21:32,wallstreetbets,No. Make me
2021-05-13 21:34:25,wallstreetbets,"So these were from a previously approved round and the ones voters just approved are ""locked up"" until 2022?"
2021-05-13 21:06:47,wallstreetbets,Thanks on it
2021-05-13 22:02:13,wallstreetbets,"For some like me that grabbed only 30-50 shares at $13-$15 was betting on a new GME. It was exploding the night it went up. So a lot jumped on. I always knew on its own merit, and amount of holders. It would hit 15-20 on its own merit, after a long wait till summer/fall. But I don‚Äôt believe personally it‚Äôs gonna hit $100 plus. I‚Äôd rather get my money back than wait for maybe $20 to make $80 or so. Just a bad move back then for many. I could do a lot more with the $400-$500 elsewhere. If I bought at $2-$8 with minimum 100 shares, I would hold right now."
2021-05-14 00:31:36,wallstreetbets,Eating crayons makes my balls big
2021-05-13 21:43:43,wallstreetbets,I have 102. Bought in Jan. Been crazy watching it go up.. might just buy more at the dip.. definitely wish I would have just taken the risk and bought 1000 shares.
2021-05-13 20:49:46,wallstreetbets,This is such good advice it should probably be banned from this sub lol

If it hits $100, gonna sell off  about 1/3 of my shares. Gonna hold the rest and see what happens. Averaging at $7.00/share, so it's all free money at this point."
2021-05-13 22:29:03,wallstreetbets,Keep buying. Lower your average. I worked mine down to 8.50.

2021-05-14 03:52:25,wallstreetbets,How do we know they didn‚Äôt sell the shares to cover the shorts outside of the normal market? Hence no price movement?

Then some of those bonds are ""bought"" by the Fed, but all they do is give the banks an IOU and a note saying ""you can loan out N times as much money as the IOU is worth"". Still no new actual cash out there. Only when the *banks* lend out that money is money 'created'. And that loaned cash has to be paid back eventually; it isn't out there forever.

2021-05-14 05:39:46,wallstreetbets,"It's based in the concept of discounting cash flows. A company is only worth the value of all of its future profits discounted back to today. 

Why ""discount""? Because $1 earned today is worth more than $1 earned a year from now. 

 How do we compare money earned today versus money earned years in the future? Interest rates.

At a given interest rate, what amount would you need today to have $1 in the future? This is the 'present value' of that future $. Now you can compare alternatives of receiving money today versus receiving money in the future effectively by using present values of each scenario. 

Assuming 10% interest rates: 

1) $1 earned today is worth $1

2) The present value of a dollar earned 1 year from now is  $0.909

3) the present value of a dollar earned 2 years from now is $0.826

What does this mean? It means if someone offered to pay you $1 a year from now or $0.95 today, you take the $0.95.  $0.95 > $0.909. Said differently, if you took $0.95 today and invested it @ 10%, you have more than $1 in a year. 


Now assuming 15% interest rates: 
1) $1 earned today is worth $1

2) The present value of a dollar earned a year from now is  $0.870

3) the present value of a dollar earned 2 years from now is $0.756

Notice as the interest rates rise, the present value falls. It takes less money today to grow because interest is higher. 

 If a company is just the present value of all of its future profits, then the present value of a company is expected to fall as interest rates rise. 

Why does this effect tech companies more? More of their value is expected to be in future years due to their high growth rates (and often limited profitability today). Notice the delta in present values in the 1-year scenarios and the 2-year scenarios above. The PV in 2-year scenario drops ~2x as much. The further the profits are expected from today, the more sensitive they are to interest rate changes."
2021-05-14 09:48:53,wallstreetbets,"Dude imho real inflation hasn't been around during a time that tech was as important and powerful in our society as it is currently. Everyone that says you should drop tech BeCaUsE InFlAtIoN is in my opinion reading an extremely old edition of a textbook whose footnotes were disproven. 

Case in point- if businesses should be worried about inflation, how will they hedge? I can name quite a few tech institutions that are hedging with some digital assets. Are industrials planning on doing the same, or will they stick with the accruing debt playbook?"

2021-05-14 09:50:41,wallstreetbets,WHAT DID YOU CALL ME SIR!!??
2021-05-14 03:54:15,wallstreetbets,One of the few markets we can be sure will be non-existent in a few years is that of a (insurance) broker. It‚Äôs going to be okay man! Can always become a bag-packer.
2021-05-14 19:04:56,wallstreetbets,It seems like you put some effort into this. Are you aware the Clintons are involved? Are you aware of what happens to those that speak out against them?
2021-05-13 20:13:54,wallstreetbets,"It's me, one of the scumbag agents. I really hope I'm personally not a scumbag though. Yes Medicare Advantage has networks, but, depending on your zip code, you can sometimes get PPO's for $0 premiums with out of network benefits. Sometimes the network make sense for the customer, but it isn't for everyone. They are getting more attractive every year, whereas 5 years ago I would have said don't go near medicare advantage, I really do switch more people to MA every year. But I do agree, there are a lot of scumbag agents chasing a dollar - probably enrolling people in Clover Health."
2021-05-14 06:30:06,wallstreetbets,Tell me about it!

2021-05-14 10:49:19,wallstreetbets,Well at least it is headed the right direction for now... let‚Äôs see if it all gets given back again.
2021-05-14 09:34:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah - very strange activity. It beat earnings and went up $25 (25%) in AH trading that same day and then the very next day literally gave it all back. Not sure why that would be unless it was as simple as institutional investors buying it up and the old institutional investors getting out. Wacky.

2021-05-13 21:41:29,wallstreetbets,Palantir is one of the most successful companies in the stock market today set up for infinite growth. Just have to keep buying and give it time. I'm suprise the price target isn't higher honestly.

2021-05-14 03:00:20,wallstreetbets,they probably meant $17 since they have a habit of adding extra zeros...Remember this is the same company that wrote a check to Revlon for $900 million instead of $9 million.
2021-05-14 03:50:26,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow it's that easy huh. Okay, I officially give GME a sell rating at $3."

2021-05-14 13:08:50,wallstreetbets,Probably a typo they ment 17 lmao
2021-05-13 22:39:12,wallstreetbets,Typo. Should be $17 or $70.

2. Well yeah, no shit. I hope the squeeze happens, but GME is profitable for me at $101 too, so I can afford to hold. $180 is still a really high price as far as I'm concerned."
2021-05-13 21:11:02,wallstreetbets,I was looking at this earlier today.  What app specifically?  There are 3 Fidelity apps in the iOS appstore.
2021-05-14 07:12:52,wallstreetbets,"For me, I‚Äôm yet to see solid thesis on why a short squeeze is unlikely or a way that shorts wouldn‚Äôt have to cover. 

The risk I feel is that you are reliant on millions of other retail investors not paperhanding. But they‚Äôve been pretty resilient for months now. 

Would I YOLO life savings on GME/AMC?  No. 

But I think it‚Äôs worth gambling an amount I can afford to lose and seeing it out to the end. 

Just my personal view on it."
2021-05-14 08:34:59,wallstreetbets,OH NO!! <shocked pikachu face>

If your home¬†was¬†built before 1978, it is more likely to have¬†lead-based¬†paint. In 1978, the federal government¬†banned¬†consumer uses of¬†lead-based¬†paint, but some states¬†banned¬†it even earlier. Some can have no symptoms, but people may experience:

Pain areas: in the abdomen or joints
Gastrointestinal: constipation, nausea, or vomiting
Developmental: learning disability or slow growth
Whole body: fatigue or loss of appetite
Behavioral: hyperactivity or irritability
Also common: baby colic, headache, insomnia, or memory loss

One right off the bat is when [Gura got age restricted playing resident evil 2](https://youtu.be/eZgFpqswapE) (which disables super chat) and she didn‚Äôt even bother to stop the stream to reset.

Another time is when Ame purposely turns off super chat because she‚Äôs receiving too many.

They‚Äôre really there to entertain their audience, not specifically only to make money."
2021-05-13 22:06:25,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it just depends on if it‚Äôs your thing or not. I won‚Äôt fault them for not liking Hololive, but I‚Äôll vehemently disagree with criticism that ignores their talent. Like, people fanatically devote themselves to Pew, XQC, or Asmongold, and you do you, but ignoring them because their avatars? That‚Äôs kinda trashy. Hololive is wholesome with dashes of mature humor sprinkled in, rather than just being edgy or nonstop swearing like other streamers, and I just have to appreciate it."
2021-05-14 01:43:05,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll give you an upvote for gigguk lol. I don‚Äôt watch streamers since toast and forsen stopped hearthstone and even then I only watched clips. I find twitch streamers really boring, tried watching a Ludwig stream (drawing and guessing game) and it was just really stale jokes and bad art. I think the only reason it was interesting was for the cash prize. VTubers seem to put in a lot more work but for me it still seems like cut anime girl says bad word is what‚Äôs popular. Reminds me of people laughing because a kid said a bad word or said something grown up. I do enjoy stories but the ones he mentioned seem very meh. I get their popularity and would probably would have liked them if I was in middle school. If you have an anime recommendation throw it my way lol. Haven‚Äôt watched anime in a while."
2021-05-14 01:50:41,wallstreetbets,"Demon Slayer and Jujutsu Kaisen are pretty hot and popular lately. Some old classics that are still top tier are Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Hunter x Hunter, and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Some longer ones still running are the Jojo Series, and mainstreams like One Piece (how is it still ongoing?!)

But yeah I don't watch anime as much anymore too, been busy with life and instead started reading and watching Vtubers more."

2021-05-14 01:42:23,wallstreetbets,"How banks build up extra reserves is a manifold answer, it's usually through:

1. Overnight lending by the Fed to some institutions that have to meet cash obligations to some other institutions but don't want to have to decrease lending to get those reserves to pay. So: bank A borrows money from bank B (to lend out), bank B chickens out and wants their cash back in case shit goes sideways because of event X (could be crisis, could be cash crunch etc). Bank A has already made the loans, so they don't have cash on hand unless they recall the loans already made. They turn to the Fed for an overnight loan collateralised by the Treasuries they hold. Fed makes the loan with reserves credited into bank A and bank A pays bank B with reserves. Bank B now has extra reserves that they do not need to back up their deposits -> Excess reserves.
2. QE: Fed wants to directly expand broad money (reserves + coins + notes are just base money, no one can spend/lend reserves in the non-banking world), they go out to the market to buy bonds from funds. But they have to give someone the reserves (cash is shit for billions of dollars), so they go to the fund's bank A, credit them with reserves, bank A opens a deposit for the fund matching the amount. But this amount of reserves is greater than what's needed to back up their deposits -> excess reserves.

Yes it should nudge the t-bill rates up in the short end since, as far as I understand (I don't work in a bank), repo and short T-bills are pretty substitutable. If you're a money market funds, there are some regulations about what you have to hold so there might be some preferences here and there."

My theory is this I don't see the CPI numbers dropping anytime soon so hence the month or two timeline on them.  It tends to just waffle up and down in small increments but has steadily moved downward when CPI numbers come out.  I mean obviously there's a shitload of any other variables that could blow this whole thing apart like some new uncureable COVID strain out of India or something then its back up to the moon.

And this isn't a day trade and i got no TA for ya this is just looking at the general economy and going yep i think stuff is going to keep going up in price while wages will stay the same hence more inflation i'm also think that the fed will eventually raise interest rates before the end of this year.

At this point the markets don't make sense and the governments stopped pretending it's a free economy, they control everything.

2021-05-14 06:21:06,wallstreetbets,We shall see if the current rise in prices is actual inflation or just price rising to meet demand. We're not going to know if prices are going to return to normal until this time next year. I believe that they will in most products which have competition in the marketplace. Products that have an price increases due to unprecedented demand this year that don't have competition will probably leave their prices high and bath in the extra margin.

Prices will drop.

I honestly think that the inflation fear-mongering has more to do with the financial systems and interested parties not wanting to see wages rise.  2020 had probably one of the most unusual turnover in jobs since, well, never.  In addition, work from home, which was strongly resisted by many companies in the past, was shown to be a very viable solution for many companies.  This allows a greater job market for employees, as you no longer have to live where you work, so much more opportunities available.   Also, people sitting home for a year had time to find new hobbies, learn new skills, and discover perhaps that the field or job they used to have just wasn't as good as they thought.  Many people also realized the savings that staying home caused and probably re-tooled their budgets.  Also, many women left the workforce during all this and some dual earner households may decide to change that.  So in general, all these things are going to make employees a lot more picky when it comes to employment, thus demanding a higher wage.

 If wages increase on the low side, that extra $ is less for the high side.  If they try to pass along the cost to consumers then the gov will have no choice to increase tax or interest to prevent inflation which will also have a greater effect for the high side.  So both ways they lose.  They are trying to scare companies to downsize staff in anticipation of this artificial ""inflation"" in order to keep the underlings in their place.

TLDR; Headhunters and employment firms are gonna bank in this post covid economy."
2021-05-14 01:26:14,wallstreetbets,"The fun thing about student debt and inflation is that if inflation is 4-6% it actually means your debt is shrinking (relatively) by that much each year.  I dunno what current loan rates are but people who took loans when I did are only paying 3-5% for interest.  So you are basically getting a negative interest.  And if you have cash left over that you didn't spend from the loan, you can throw it in a treasury bond and get the inflation rate as the interest.  And you still get the tax writeoff at the end of the year.   It's  free money."
2021-05-14 01:25:17,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps. I tend to stay off the conspiracy aspect, but that can always be explained as self-interest (i.e. wanting wages to stay low) forming opinions (that inflation is going up) without it being a deliberative process (i.e. it is not a conspiracy)."
2021-05-14 03:30:41,wallstreetbets,"oh no, I didn't mean to imply conspiracy.  Lots of self interested parties just spouting their own self-interested narratives, to which elevated wages represent a danger to their interests.  But you also have to understand how things get into the news cycle - well thought-out and delivered press releases that assert the narrative that is in their benefit.  If you think for a second that banks and companies -don't- have meetings about this type of stuff, you've had more honest jobs than me."

Warren Buffet years ago said he does not short shares for this very reason... The price is high so the company raises funds which in turn puts them on more solid footing which gets the shareholders excited and the price goes up and so on.

It is nuts if you consider AMC's current market cap is probably 7X what it was before COVID, without any fundamental improvement in the business.

Unless AMC changes their business for the better, and better than it has ever been, anyone investing in them today is going to find themselves down the line holding a near worthless stock."

2021-05-14 01:27:19,wallstreetbets,"The Xilinx merger, interests rate re-valuation, TSM production constraints (drought, over demands for chips), and intel engineering focus ceo are main reasons for amd at $73.

The vertical, mostly non-competitive merger between Xilinx and amd depends on China. It‚Äôs a Major risk, even if approval seem likely. A clear example would be with NXPI merger with quadcom, which was not approved. The end of the year is a conservative estimate, and the merger may close sooner under the perfect conditions. Xilinx ceo has commented on the merger as proceeding along. UK regulators are ending open comments against the merger May 21 based on articles found. President Joe Biden wants the job act pass first before moving on. China is likely not in the cross hair yet. We got 6 to 7 months more. amd is better with the merger as a company. Amd stock may have been better off without the merger near terms. Less parties shorting amd and going long Xilinx.

Interests rates are believed to be capped at 2% or less based on comments about bond market and US feds. Covid is not ending else where without vaccination (beside likely the USA and for sure Israel). Negative interest rates (demands for US bonds) are still there globally. Women unemployment is high in the US. Childcare is decimated. 

Intel the other factor.
Intel is expected to be pulling off Alder Lake for the massive with reportedly 20% IPC boost, windows scheduler optimized for heterogeneous workload vs current homogeneous workloads, and wide availability for ddrm 5 (expecting 10% available in 2021 according to dr Ian from Anandtech). Alder lake max configuration is 8 golden coves (high performance core with 16 threads) and 8 gracemont/ atoms (low energy consumption with 8 threads). It looks to be losing out to AMD in total performance. Not sure about lower consumption? 

If alder is less than expectations, amd should head higher. 

As apple moves toward 5 nm, more 7 nm allocation is available to every one else. TSM is also expanding. Supply constraint is at its maximum now, and less so going forward?

Amd pricing should be higher with merger conclusion approaching. Sell OTM calls to stay long the stocks / long terms calls ? 

I am bottom fishing with options and long the stocks into the merger."

2021-05-14 13:31:21,wallstreetbets,"These inflation numbers seems to have a lot more to do with supply chain constraints. Typical macro supply and demand. Labor is be part of this too with unemployment benefits. Once supply chain normalizes both on the logistical and manufacturing product front as well as on the labor front, so does inflation."
2021-05-14 01:53:21,wallstreetbets,"I think so, they just cant afford to work especially when prices are so much higher. I bet its also the real reason behibd the unrests, wages are too low for the average person to have a reasonable life. Wages are too low because the fed has made return on capital too high through complete wreckless monetary policy."
2021-05-14 13:57:00,wallstreetbets,You left out the odd trillion printed money here and there...
2021-05-14 01:55:46,wallstreetbets,"I don't see interest rates as the problem. 60% of the wealth in the country is being skimmed off by the top 1% who largely don't pay taxes. Society is largely collapsing under the weight of this. The state of affairs is by design, not by accident, and it has happened before. Ever heard of the French Revolution? It solved a similar problem efficiently."
2021-05-14 14:09:30,wallstreetbets,"True, but what we‚Äôre seeing is the double whammy of both. And inflation (in the CPI sense) has been pretty minimal for many years, with 2020 only being .7%. Take away the constraints and it changes the picture to a healthier level."
2021-05-14 14:16:05,wallstreetbets,"Point is, supply chain management has a lot to do with a lot, especially when most of industry is set up for just in time manufacturing and having to switch to stockpiling, creating a huge surge in current demand since it‚Äôs forecasting (or mitigating potential risk of) future manufacturing and logistical constraints."
2021-05-14 02:00:13,wallstreetbets,"Lets hope it doesnt go that far when the stupid ruling class can avoid this by raising wages, interest rates and tax."
2021-05-14 09:44:38,wallstreetbets,"your point about splitting index up is worth an additional reply. I know exactly how this works since any stock index works in identical way. 

Eg, sometimes a stock will show a blowout move due to earnings or take over. This will show that day it was reaponsible for x% of the move of index. Looking at the data you'd be tempted to dismiss it, call it transitory or one off, but its a silly way to look at things, because you have no idea what fair value is or what is priced in right now. Ie. the stock should have been at xxx if we had perfect data but we had to wait til earnings to find out this data, thus it shows a jump to fair value. 

Same thing for prices of any item in the cpi, non can be dismissed, used cars could have been specially beaten down over last months due to xyz and this month it bounces. Just like whichever item showed a big drop this month is likely to reverse with a big jump or steady rise later. 

It is absolutely non sense to dismiss any part of cpi data because you have no idea what is the fair value of any of the items. The used car data series only makes sense to a used car sales man, since nobody is an expert in everything we can only look at the level of the index. to say a rise is transitory, you are basically speculating prices will fall on average without reduction in money supply, they might, but a typical economist will have zero basis for this speculation and we should attach zero importance to these types of forecasts...

As to split mon inflation with the rest. forget it, it is completely impractical. You can never disentangle money from demand supply, its like disassociating the length of your sofa from the ruler you are measuring with..."
2021-05-14 10:09:48,wallstreetbets,"Inflation (in this case, CPI) is high because a year ago we had massive deflation. [Source](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/economicdata/cpi_05122020.pdf)

This higher inflation (CPI) is a correction from that previous data point. It's like in March when the stock market was up to something like 120% year on year.

But everything that's up high has a reason. For example, used cars are so high because the chip shortage is creating a shortage of new cars. (New cars aren't up because manufacturers set those prices, while used cars are a more open market). When the chip shortage is resolved the price of used cars will drop.

Oil has a similar issue, oil companies cut production and it'll take time to ramp back up.

But CPI isn't the only aspect of inflation. For example, it doesn't account for wages. It doesn't account for material costs. Etc. The idea the CPI is the end all be all to inflation is incorrect. It's only one indicator, and the trend of future inflation might or might not correlate to this.

April 2022 the CPI will likely be very low (or maybe even negative again) because the inflated costs will decrease as the market works out things like the oil supply and shortages. What I mean by ""true"" inflation, is the long-term real value reduction of the dollar after this oscillation caused by the pandemic ends. We won't know the hard impact of inflation for years."
2021-05-14 10:58:26,wallstreetbets,"your idea could happen but you need to understand you are speculating on a whole series of events - chip shortagr going away, input costs all coming down and wages not going up and nothing else disruptive happening... What you are doing is basic mean reversion trade, any mean reversion trader will tell you your odds are just slightly in favor but the one incorrect bet will blow out your account.

The fed is not competant enough to make bets like this and should never claim inflation is transitory as they clearly have no ability to forecast it."
2021-05-14 11:16:52,wallstreetbets,"You seem to misunderstand my position. I'm not saying that inflation isn't high. I've been saying the entire time that most likely inflation isn't high. Anything in the market is speculation. But are the odds in favor of a lower (2-3% inflation) or a higher (4%-5%) inflation, in the long term. It's more likely to be lower because the April 2020 - April 2021 inflation rate is unreliable."
2021-05-14 14:05:03,wallstreetbets,"I get your view, im just saying it could very easily get worse instead of better."

2021-05-14 06:48:43,wallstreetbets,"Inflation will not be necessary for metals to take off. Both have already experienced nice gains over the last 12 months and it wasn't due to money printing. Defaults and bankruptcies are on the horizon and CMBS is gonna be a thing. Plenty of debt is going to be extinguished and those dollars will disappear. This inflationary period is only going to last for so long. The dollar is not going to crash and talk of Euro or Yuan is not based in reality

The actual demand for a very limited supply will be the driver regardless of traditional economic indicators. Fear will drive gold (it's already happening) and silver will follow.

There's probably one more significant downdraft for metals but demand will be epic and premiums will be stunning."

In the 80s the times were different and this time we are even in front of a bigger mountain to climb, the mount everest. So be prepared for inflation.

2021-05-14 13:34:55,wallstreetbets,"I mean it's kind of a hobby too.

Also these are auctions, if they didn't want to get ripped off they'd set a starting bid or directly sell at a given price. Short of melting them, they're only valuable to people who think they're valuable. To everyone else, they're just some random old coins we found in grandpa's drawer.

And lots of these coins were like 90% silver. Individually they're small but it adds up fast, and sometimes you're buying for less than 50% of the melt value.

And again, the melt value is just their floor value. Some can be worth 2, 3, 4x as much. I couldn't tell you why some random years and mints are more valuable than others to save my life (besides basic supply and demand), but there are plenty of amateur and professional resources out there that list how much they're worth.

2021-05-14 07:00:07,wallstreetbets,Was it consensual or of the unwanted butt play with toys variety? Are aliens selfish lovers or did it make sure you got off too? Do aliens wear condoms or is there no need since interspecies pregnancy is super unlikely? How does your comment have zero follow up questions other than mine?
2021-05-14 16:34:33,wallstreetbets,I can not tell you if it was consensual because I dont speak alien.

2021-05-14 10:37:45,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but what sparked the sell-off? 18% drop into a 2nd 3.5% (so far today) drop today on a big beat must mean that they guided lower or some other issues, right?  


I'm interested and starting to dig on this stock, but if you folks already invested are ahead of me, please share!"
2021-05-14 11:23:09,wallstreetbets,"They said they might mine about 20% less next quarter due to corona. But that doesn't justify a 23% drop, especially since that's temporary and they would have still beat earnings with those numbers now probably.

It‚Äôs not like ‚Äúoops, how did more shares get in there???‚Äù 43 million shares were the last ones they had to dilute with( which they‚Äôve had since 2013 btw and is most likely less than 5% of what HF‚Äôs need to cover) and it just so happens that institutions that weren‚Äôt shorting AMC, like Vanguard and Blackrock, and retail investors took majority of those. Not to mention 80 million out of the 300 million in volume yesterday were shorts... that‚Äôs double the shares that were just diluted and the price rose 25%. If the stock keeps being heavily shorted and retail and institutions not shorting the stock are buying up any shares the company‚Äôs diluting with... what‚Äôs your point?"

2021-05-14 11:52:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah same, May 25th. They need to start paying dividends or do some buyback. Hows your stick literally the same price it was at IPO? Its been what, 8 to 9 months now? They don't care abiut their investors at all. The stocks been trading 80% of the time in a range. Lets see what the meeting is all about else I'm bailing first chance. Not to mention, there is hardly any volume so no one is touching this stock."
2021-05-14 11:54:23,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd prefer they release 3% more into the float, so ETFs and S&P can pick it up. I know the sale would cause a further dip, but the upward pressure after that would be immense"

There are cases like the Lonnie Zamora incident, USS Nimitz encounter or the Arial school sighting that are very interesting and can't be easily explained.

If you're new to this I highly recommend watching the documentary The Phenomenon by James Fox."

2021-05-13 20:56:30,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely not.

I may be biased, my wife does work for a subsidiary of Nucor so I do have a conflict of interests. But I do get to overhear a lot in how they‚Äôre discussing the quarters they‚Äôre having. Steel is BOOMING. We‚Äôve tried to get as much stock as possible. People are building like crazy post-COVID. Production is crazy right now. There is SO much demand.

I think if they get the infrastructure plan off the ground federally, Nucor is going to get A LOT of that money. All those infrastructure talks are subject to Buy American laws. Also, SECDEF was on Nucor‚Äôs Board before Biden tapped him. I love Nucor‚Äôs outlook."

2021-05-13 20:51:29,wallstreetbets,"Uh.. that‚Äôs not how investing works.

I bought in at $45 in February not because I expected it to hit $300 again anytime soon, but because it was a great investment at that price. Since then, they‚Äôve brought on many high level e-commerce executive talent, completed a $500M stock sale, paid off their long term debt, and opened a huge distribution center in PA. They are in such a fantastic position for growth.

So if it hits $40 again, I‚Äôm not dumping my 401k in because I think it‚Äôs going to immediately rebound, I‚Äôm dumping it in because it‚Äôs an incredible value and I couldn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd be getting the same deal I got before all that happened.

You‚Äôre talking about GME being worth $2.9B market cap (after just raising $550M of capital). That‚Äôs so insane, I would absolutely love that opportunity."

Best part (though not good if it happens) unlike leverage trading in the stock market, if your price target doesn‚Äôt hit, you don‚Äôt owe the money you leveraged.

The analyst of Raymond James (who has not been able to understand the RNG potential, as since when the stock was below $3 he had a neutral rating...) missing the larger picture......  
  
But why now RNG trucks deserve attention? BEV trucks, especially for class 8 versions, are not yet there from a commercial point of view. The ones that will be available will likely require:  
  
\- either some time to be charged  
\- and / or some space from the cargo capacity of the truck.  
  
If you add to this that in some harbors like the LA ones, 16k trucks operate per day, it becomes clear that the area would not be able to stand all these vehicles to switch to electricity. The grid will not be there tomorrow and won't be there in 5 years.  
  
Most importantly, Regulation on the emission side is not waiting for BEV trucks. California will require already in 2024 all trucks to record -75% NOX...

http://www.etnet.com.hk/www/tc/stocks/realtime/quote\_shortsell.php?code=9988"
2021-05-14 13:58:50,wallstreetbets,This stock is heavily shorted. But fundamentals are great for it. Great long-term hold.
2021-05-14 15:09:46,wallstreetbets,"Lol DocMD is fluff. Best to review their financials and I'm not talking the little stuff you see on morningstar or yahoo finance. Read their 100+pg doc and you'll know why it's not ""well"" (no pun intended)."
2021-05-14 10:07:04,wallstreetbets,"Baba will reward you big time, but you need to have üíé balls and patience."
2021-05-14 13:47:05,wallstreetbets,Oh my alibaba so undervalued that‚Äôs why Cathie wood dumped 200 million rollers worth baba on earnings üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2021-05-14 13:46:29,wallstreetbets,Yay enjoy alibaba while it dips
2021-05-14 13:52:06,wallstreetbets,Cathy wood and over valued stocks that will crash... Zillow and others similar
2021-05-14 14:00:17,wallstreetbets,Haha good luck getting baba in the ass
2021-05-14 06:09:43,wallstreetbets,I buy my copper for 1/3 spot. I get a box of 25$ from the bank and separate the pre-1982 from the new ones. Each penny is .03
2021-05-14 15:14:52,wallstreetbets,"I mean, isn‚Äôt that what Google is for? Asking questions?"
2021-05-14 10:59:25,wallstreetbets,Looks like they are building a production facility in Colorado.
2021-05-14 12:04:09,wallstreetbets,Sold - thanks
2021-05-14 03:56:27,wallstreetbets,Following this play. Look like it is falling back to the former SPAC NAV. Any update analysis on the last few days event?
2021-05-14 10:38:47,wallstreetbets,"I'm looking at 17ish by next week and 23 ish about 2-3 weeks out - pending any detrimental catalyst. 

https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZEjEohog/"
2021-05-13 22:37:36,wallstreetbets,"update for notes:

Cathie now has 22,316,365 shares. Bad data of float above, it's 205.91M, so she owns 10.9% of float now. borrow fee spiked to 29.6% on iborrowdesk.

TA wise it's bearish. just watching for now but she's on to something"
2021-05-14 11:21:22,wallstreetbets,lol didn't even realized its up 12% today. going back to where it belongs i guess
2021-05-13 22:45:23,wallstreetbets,Thanks friend. I‚Äôll share some charts later tonight and tomorrow. Like a week out. Just for viewing.  Still not touching it until it finds support at 15.
2021-05-14 11:24:27,wallstreetbets,yeah. 15 is üîë imo. If it closes above today ill look at playing mid day on monday!
2021-05-14 12:06:06,wallstreetbets,ooh boy you in? some fomo but risky
2021-05-14 12:18:51,wallstreetbets,Nah. I missed the rip this morning but if it holds support into close Ill look for an entry on monday!
2021-05-14 12:19:18,wallstreetbets,trim at 17 - 20 and look for PT  23 in the next few weeks IMO but lets see :)
2021-05-13 20:21:25,wallstreetbets,Same. I bought in soon after that TX storm.
2021-05-14 11:04:35,wallstreetbets,"Now vanguard just bought almost 8,000,000 shares today."
2021-05-14 08:16:11,wallstreetbets,Short shares available are now at zero. Now is the time to buy and squeeze.
2021-05-14 12:00:24,wallstreetbets,Now over 9 million institutional shares bought today and counting. This represents a 6% increase in institutional ownership today alone.

2021-05-14 07:46:16,wallstreetbets,"Isnt TTD doing. 10:1 split in June?
Being under 500 I think I‚Äôm about to buy into it"
2021-05-14 06:16:51,wallstreetbets,To be fair it was before a crazy pandemic that shut everything down
2021-05-14 01:39:17,wallstreetbets,Dash is up on earnings are you going to reenter? Seems like a great position to do so.
2021-05-14 12:47:15,wallstreetbets,Looks like $ROPE squad for you today
2021-05-14 09:08:25,wallstreetbets,"I just want this to be over. I keep thinking it is, but the price flux is too attractive to my stupid brain. Sitting in here at 8.30 average on CLNE watching idiots make more money than me while an OIL PIPELINE PROBLEM tanks a literal clean energy company..."
2021-05-14 12:48:21,wallstreetbets,This thing is propped up by SoftBank as an early investor. It's valuation has never made sense to me. Considering some puts though after it absolutely ripped today
2021-05-14 12:53:47,wallstreetbets,"Down 5% overall, could have done worse![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_bad_man)"
2021-05-14 10:04:43,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm with you. I played round one of GME and did pretty well, 5 figure gains so not as great as some but good enough. I sat out round 2 because it made no sense to me and I was certain it was just the HF messing with it and would rug pull it. Which kind of happened but not completely. Now, I just really have no idea how it‚Äôs maintaining its price other than it being a hyped value storage stock."
2021-05-14 13:22:45,wallstreetbets,I planned to short it at 130. Glad I dodged that bullet. Holy jesus.
2021-05-14 12:58:41,wallstreetbets,That's actually really solid consider the 26% up it is today. I expected you to lose it all
2021-05-14 10:09:46,wallstreetbets,"¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 

I was lucky enough to double my portfolio value back then because the huge dumps triggered my stop losses, but it feels like I've regressed so much on my positions following that whole business. Wish I was just playing the peaks and dips of GME sometimes, feel like that's the most predictable thing about this market right now."
2021-05-14 13:05:21,wallstreetbets,"Well I got out early at market open, thank got for tight stop loss :)

I'm considering shorting more after this bull run, betting the institutions are gonna help me"
2021-05-14 13:06:30,wallstreetbets,I'm watching it as well. Would love to make lambos on this thing dropping. One of my most hated stocks
2021-05-14 16:53:54,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll jump in on it once it stabilizes a bit.
2021-05-14 10:47:27,wallstreetbets,"Just wanted to revisit this - I work for a very large chemical/materials company who has moved their values progressively over the last decade, but not to the point of being ‚Äúwoke.‚Äù They are rooted in traditional values (they‚Äôre the only notable thing about our town of >50,000). They notified us yesterday (we are all still working from home) that our return to workplace would not be as originally planned - that we would be seeing a hybrid, next generation model put in place. 

Neat that even a company like ours is molding. They just had a year of ‚Äúfree‚Äù case study that they probably previously thought couldn‚Äôt have been done."
2021-05-14 10:05:29,wallstreetbets,"$100 puts at ATH were dirt cheap. Plus I‚Äôd need to own shares, I don‚Äôt sell naked"
2021-05-14 12:15:50,wallstreetbets,...what do you think the C in CSP stands for?
2021-05-14 13:24:01,wallstreetbets,"I believed you, I‚Äôm an idiot"
2021-05-14 06:19:04,wallstreetbets,Do we invest in this or whatt
2021-05-14 14:30:19,wallstreetbets,"I can‚Äôt read, but this post looks long enough to be decent DD. 1x $7 5/21 calls @ $0.21 and 50x shares @ 6.66 üöÄüöÄüöÄ"

2021-05-14 11:05:30,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm no financial advisor or financial expert, first of all. I also have no experience with options.

But based on Inovio‚Äôs timeline, late 2021 (Nov-Dec) is the earliest. I‚Äôd be looking at 2022, 2023 as safer estimates."
2021-05-14 01:39:27,wallstreetbets,^ this guy doesn't get it

2021-05-14 15:25:07,wallstreetbets,Thank you for this info. I saw some people saying they bought it even before it went meme because it was a good buy. I'll keep an eye on it and will hold.
2021-05-13 23:03:04,wallstreetbets,NEVER
2021-05-13 23:17:42,wallstreetbets,Monkey see monkey do
2021-05-14 04:23:39,wallstreetbets,Right now we talk about inflation... The pressure is enormous. Let‚Äôs wait for this to cool down a bit. Xpeng will rebounce later.

2021-05-14 02:02:12,wallstreetbets,">Their financials suck - double increase in revenue and yet a 20% reduction in NI losses - for every dollar they make they lose 80% in profit

Earnings released, looking good, but the stocks still flat!"
