2021-05-14 18:58:31,wallstreetbets,I definitely think it's highly overvalued. I've made some money off puts but I'm gonna keep at it esp if the market stays red

2021-05-14 19:22:15,wallstreetbets,"I'm shocked. Useful DD on this sub? What are you doing?

Seriously, kudos for an objective look at a company that you have some bias towards because you use their services.

I think it's too early to invest until there's more information to go on.

I wonder if it will be an acquisition by one of the big guys down the road if it grows its user base and proves itself over a few years."
2021-05-14 19:05:38,wallstreetbets,Exactly thanks 🦍 rblx is Bs
2021-05-14 18:55:02,wallstreetbets,Great DD. cant wait to see how it plays out.
2021-05-14 19:00:17,wallstreetbets,"long roblox here.  I bought in for a stupid reason - on twitch, a guy I follow streams it and people just flock to this guys channel to play roblox with him.  People LOVE it, and although the guy is nice, he is a bit boring.  I’m convinced his growth is because kids are obsessed w the game.  Was enough for me!"
2021-05-14 19:11:42,wallstreetbets,"My account was banned from a game for a made-up reason. The only way to dispute is through recording my sessions, because who doesn't record every play-session they have, right?  Anyway, proof of innocence falls on me, no support from Roblox.

No way I'm spending any money In-platform or investing into it. Total garbage. Downvote if you like, but from user-end I absolutely hate Roblox.

&#x200B;

Edit: Kids are obsessed with it? Sure. Wait until they get banned from their favorite games willy-nilly. That would really help Roblox long-term."
2021-05-14 19:01:08,wallstreetbets,"The thing about this particular pick is that, as a business model, it does have incredible upside. I do agree in that its current price is overvalued but if Roblox can show that this model is a winning one, then their books will grow to match their market valuation."
2021-05-14 19:36:08,wallstreetbets,"It's literally been trading sideways, how'd you make money off puts? 'Grats on timing the top each time if that's the case"
2021-05-14 19:32:17,wallstreetbets,"I definitely should've covered how marketwide phenomena would affect Roblox's share price, but oh well. I do agree, we're in a transitional period of the market for different industries to outperform the wider market."
2021-05-14 19:28:54,wallstreetbets,"Can't say I'm very experienced with this either, so it's good that I was born with a wrinkle or too. I don't play Roblox actively anymore but the bias is still there nonetheless, I spent most of my early gaming years playing it. The upside for investing early can be definitely much higher but if Roblox can't sustain this growth then the trade can also go bad with an early entry.  


If it gets acquired by Apple I'm blowing my brains out on the spot. Doubt they would, I'd bet money Microsoft or something would nab it."
2021-05-14 19:04:18,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-05-14 19:19:35,wallstreetbets,"If you were banned from an individual game, I can't really see how Roblox can mediate that dispute, especially with the sheer amount of games that exist on the platform. However, I do understand the sentiment. There's definitely room for improvement for user end stuff, and I do think their user support is a little behind, and their report system is... bad, to say the least, from my memory. I remember one of my accounts got warned for, and I quote, ""being teh KKK"".

This still doesn't change the fact the company has a model that has good, if not great, upside potential."

2021-05-14 19:56:07,wallstreetbets,"I’ve made a little bit on puts.  It’ll go up and down.  Buy puts on Green Day’s.

2021-05-14 19:55:06,wallstreetbets,I bought calls expiring next year just in case. This will mark the 16th stock that I've lost money on listening to advice on reddit. Where do I keep getting the money to lose? The occasional reddit thread that causes a stock to shoot the moon for no reason. 1 win for every 5 losses roughly has put me a break even point so far. My graph is just big isosceles triangles. 20% chance op is right!

2021-05-14 19:35:00,wallstreetbets,"One other thing, we just learned that VANGUARD just bought over 9 Million shares of this company since 3/31/21 - They are now the largest shareholder of CANOO/GOEV at around $9.03 a share. The earnings call that is this Monday 05/17/21 was originall supposed to happen in June. They moved it up."

2021-05-14 19:53:53,wallstreetbets,"Good luck to you guys but this is kind of bullshit, it's sad we feel a need to resort to praying for some manipulative short squeeze to happen to boost the stock. Long term, this stock is likely to succeed or fail on the merits of the company's engineering, design, and business acumen (with a little help from the Biden admin EV push), not from temporary market shenanigans. As a long GOEV investor, I want to see them do it the right way by building a sustainable business."
2021-05-14 19:19:37,wallstreetbets,I like the skateboard platform it's unique and original. GOEV has an earnings call and potential news on Monday 05/17/21 at market close - Check it out - Then make a decision - Monday may be a game changer...

You already know the strategy is to hold shares."

Think about all the stuff that has been bleeding - Fsly, Roku, Pton, Zm, SQ, Twtr, Clne, TTD (down 30% on a 10 for 1 stock split). Those are more interesting that is why they have hit bottom and started to recover.

My guess is the macro of this is some sectors like retail are at ath -WSM, RH, KSS GPS etc.  When big money can't see big gains there any more they will turn their money somewhere else.

2021-05-14 17:12:46,wallstreetbets,AMC will break out next week. The amount of corruption and manipulation of this stock is insane. 200 million volume and yet it almost dropped.
2021-05-14 17:36:44,wallstreetbets,Bought 1000 at peak  and a 1000 more at the end of day bottom. Holding. Box office numbers hit from first blockbuster release and will hit new highs

2021-05-14 19:37:08,wallstreetbets,AMC is a trash stock that is losing 100+ million per month. The only thing they are good at is selling their debt via stock sales to retail bagholders.

2021-05-14 19:52:03,wallstreetbets,"Im referring to float in its definitive form, not including retail or institutions. Retail more than likely owns the float of GME several times over.

Compare institutional ownership of GME and AMC next week after the 13Fs are all filed. Then look at the float numbers. You will see what im talking about."

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? 

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. 

Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again."

2021-05-14 17:15:37,wallstreetbets,"Over the past year the market has pulled back three times in the 7% to 8% range only to overcome those losses and set new record highs again and again. This week saw such a pullback in the range of about 5% with the market gaining back about half of those losses in the later part of the week. We are beginning to see emerging economic data that is pointing to areas of concern - especially inflation. Inflation comes in two forms; the first is commodity inflation, most notably oil prices and ultimately gasoline. The second form is wage inflation, which is what is happening now. For example, this week McDonalds raised its minimum starting pay from $11/hour to $17/hour - not a minor increase. This big increase is because McDonalds is competing with a $900/week government check to its potential employees. Hence, wage inflation has a new and much high floor. If this trend of wage inflation continues expect the Federal Reserve to move interest rates higher. The market will not like that. Good luck to all"

2021-05-14 16:14:01,wallstreetbets,"July 16th is pushing it and $280 is way too high, but you should see some solid green days on Disney soon. As of yesterday they're expanding capacity on their theme parks, and their movie segment is still trickling out new releases but they will come roaring back as movie theaters reopen in the latter half of the year. Merchandising will surge with movie releases. I'd wait for a partial recovery and sell before Theta starts eating you alive, then maybe roll those calls out to a later date when Disney is likely to have more news."
2021-05-14 15:58:15,wallstreetbets,Want some terrible advice: sell your $11k-12k in remaining value and put them into 2023 PLTR leaps.
2021-05-14 17:57:59,wallstreetbets,"This has to be the most retarded play I have seen.  Disney pissed people off with the Gina Carano situation and lost so many subscribers.  It was guaranteed to miss subscriber count.  

The strike price was so high, Disney barely broke $200 in the past year.

I also personally hate Mickey Mouse due to getting injured at Disney theme park due to their negligence that broke 4 back ribs and put one through my lung.  Mickey fought me when all I wanted was my hospital bills paid.  I was in icu for a week.  Fuck Mickey Mouse.

2021-05-14 16:55:38,wallstreetbets,"Been following uwmc for months. If we get 9 dollars to hold long enough that MM have to hedge, I don't see a way for them to stop it after that. 

All its missing is volume/ strong buying pressure. 

Also, there were 2 large scale orders this week totaling almost 1.75mm between the 2 orders and I suspect that was Matt already starting the buyback.

If he shows his big green hulk dick even a couple times next week and added pressure from retail, that might be enough."
2021-05-14 17:23:15,wallstreetbets,"Just to reiterate here...  


\-$300M buybacks authorized. They have likely started buying as of this week. Share price hit all time low's.

\-Low amount of float available and getting even lower as they buyback shares

\-Low daily volume

\-High borrow rate + highly shorted -- they can't short forever if the share price starts moving up

\-Significant number of calls and OI vs. available float

\-Decent dividend rate to entice institutional and boomers to hold

\-Insider buying recently at $7.97/share for $470k-ish

600 shares @ $7.66 & 10 $7 calls 6/18"
2021-05-14 15:14:10,wallstreetbets,Moved to a discussion post since mods are finicky.
2021-05-14 18:04:03,wallstreetbets,"Every evening this week there has been evidence of shorts covering at around 7:30. The SP likes to go up after hours and get shorted most of the day. Typically there is a spike around 11:30 and 2:30, I believe this to be more covering. I see many Green Day’s ahead for this stock. I have call options expiring next Friday with strike prices of 7.5 and 9."

The low borrow availability combined with insane borrow rates that popped in the last 48 hours. Flirting with Max Pain on options at the moment. It’s been in the Threshold Securities list for almost 2 weeks (that should remind people of a certain other stock) The super small float and the fact that about 30% of that is held by insiders and institutional investors. There is the dividend factor too, but that one is tiny compared to the rest."

My suspicion is funds are getting much better at looking at short squeezes driven by retail.  Its not like they can’t read Wallstreetbets.  They also have better data on the real numbers for a squeeze than we get."
2021-05-14 18:09:42,wallstreetbets,Yep...it's because there is virtually no extrinsic value left in them due to theta decay and no instinsic value due to being OTM.

2021-05-14 18:42:33,wallstreetbets,No clue man but if the data is correct it does seem like a formula for a squeeze. As long as it goes into double digits I'm making decent money. I would say at least ATH and break through from there? Might not be instant could take some time.
2021-05-14 16:55:26,wallstreetbets,"I do agree that ""short squeeze"" is too often thrown about.

I am in UWMC for the value play long-term and saw the price to borrow over tripled in a single day; that had a short squeeze written all over it.

If there are only a few shares to borrow at exorbitant prices, it takes away a tool to push the price down (or at least makes it prohibitively expensive). I see that as a GREAT thing for my long position.

If WSB comes in and scares away the shorts, that's only a short-term bonus for me.

TBH, it is a runaway effect on short covers. Its not like one guy or group doing the shorting, its multiple funds and all in it for profit.

When stock price goes up, borrow costs go up, or there is no more available to short to play with the stock price; one of the funds will cover (profitably).

The other funds either think they can keep pushing it down or they know the cost to borrow will go down (because one fund is no longer borrowing them so they are available) so they stay.

A ""short squeeze"" as we on WBS know it is when all the funds are racing to get out at the same time. If they stagger getting out, we wont even notice the upward price pressure. Or if another fund sees the opportunity and dives in, wont notice.

It is when all the shorts are equally afraid and want to be the first to get out that triggers what WE call a short squeeze. Or something happens to make them afraid (like cost to borrow tripling in hours). 

The reality is that shorts cover EVERY SINGLE DAY it's just most times we don't notice because they do so strategically and in an orderly fashion.

The short squeezes we NOTICE are because those Hedge funds want to fuck each other JUST as bad as they want to fuck us and are racing to see who can get out faster :)"
2021-05-14 17:53:44,wallstreetbets,There are also funds that will want to ride retail momentum to screw over other funds
2021-05-14 16:39:32,wallstreetbets,Best of luck with your bags!
2021-05-14 17:59:06,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely.  

Its easy to end a short position at a loss small loss though.  The huge Melvin error on GME is avoidable once believed to be a danger.  The shorts have gotten away unscathed so often they screwed that one up.

Since the early squeezes it has become this mantra that has largely been lost dollars. 

Amc is making people money because of true value in recovery.  Same with silver in inflation.  

Rocket after the one squeeze, and I should have included the original, left bag holders of many, many in retail."

2021-05-14 15:37:09,wallstreetbets,OTM calls on PLTR haven’t worked out in awhile. Maybe times have changed but I’d do spreads at the money because premiums have been getting clobbered.

This retard here. Still down overall woth hasbro 😂"
2021-05-14 19:26:38,wallstreetbets,ALL IN $120 puts for July 2nd I think it was. I was really kicking myself for not buying puts when I saw the stock at $160 a couple weeks ago then saw it just at $110 like damn those puts woulda printed BIG. Then today I was stoked when I saw puts 70% off during my lunch break and went all in. Very well written piece btw reminds me of when I first joined WSB before 8 million retards joined trying to get rich off shitty videogame and lidar stocks
2021-05-14 19:24:48,wallstreetbets,I'm waiting for it to go up more then buying puts

2021-05-14 14:52:22,wallstreetbets,When did you buy these? How low did they go?
2021-05-14 15:04:57,wallstreetbets,nope
2021-05-14 14:54:47,wallstreetbets,Comment award goes to you good sir
2021-05-14 16:15:19,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-05-14 15:24:49,wallstreetbets,What's the point of jumping out after 9%?  Might as well buy the S&P if that's the goal..
2021-05-14 14:57:40,wallstreetbets,Went as low as 0.82; down a few grand but started this position end of April and just kept buying the dip.. BTFD isn't just for stonk ya know 🤓
2021-05-14 15:13:34,wallstreetbets,Bearish on big daddy PLTR?  You're an anomaly my friend!
2021-05-14 15:29:26,wallstreetbets,Why asks us then tbh
2021-05-14 15:29:24,wallstreetbets,that part
2021-05-14 15:04:49,wallstreetbets,"Gotta be scary seeing it plummet like that. Not sure if these will be ITM by August, but I'm hoping it has more room to run in the next month. You will get some time decay, but if it gets up to say 22 by next month these might be worth a bit more."
2021-05-14 15:31:44,wallstreetbets,I guess it was a rhetorical question 🤑
2021-05-14 15:16:15,wallstreetbets,It didn't really plummet relatively speaking.. Call options fluctuate wildly anything less than -30% still has hope
2021-05-14 15:32:19,wallstreetbets,I think we’re friends now tbh
2021-05-14 14:56:27,wallstreetbets,Balls deep in calls. That’s what I get for being a perma bull.
2021-05-14 18:16:47,wallstreetbets,The dip has very little to do with PLTR and more to do with the ass pounding delivered to most every growth stock. Don’t overthink...just keep buying.
2021-05-14 18:36:54,wallstreetbets,"You guys have been tricked by the crazy volatility of all these social media stocks in the last few months.

Most companies do not warrant insane deep value calls because the price has already been adjusted in by people spending a lot more time than reading a few reddit DDs and a few PR articles."
2021-05-14 16:07:16,wallstreetbets,"I might be a retard here, but 22,23,24 and 25 is only 4 years so shouldn’t your formula only be to the power of 4? 1.1x1.3^4 =3.14

My brain is wrinkle free so don’t hold back with the criticism of what I fuked up here."

2021-05-14 18:42:39,wallstreetbets,"I have usually made a point of buying stocks that have high institutional plus insider ownership. If the big boys are not interested in a stock, I probably shouldn’t be either.

I read a lot of positive things about PLTR, but why are institutions not interested in it?"
2021-05-14 14:59:41,wallstreetbets,"I’m not paying attention enough to that stock but didn’t they win a government contract? A DOD contract to be exact. Once a company gets unlimited military money there’s no way the stonk will go down unless they legit fuck up by destroying shit

I have a watchlist for any listed company with DOD contracts (especially Lockheed) due to the unlimited money game and dividends. Time to suck on the teet on america again except not grinding away my hips and knees for free college. Can’t wait for the MOASS to kickoff and the discount prices to kick in after for said watchlist"
2021-05-14 18:04:24,wallstreetbets,!remind me in 4 years
2021-05-14 16:46:35,wallstreetbets,"Why are you using a 12% discount rate (legit question, seems pretty high to me)?"

2021-05-14 16:29:01,wallstreetbets,free pi
2021-05-14 19:16:19,wallstreetbets,"Good - that’s one less bear news article we’ll have to wait on. Might as well get it out of the way when all growth/tech stocks are getting hit.

Most other smart money institutions up their share count while suggesting lower price targets; like Citi who puts it at $17, but bought in likely at $23-24. Or countless others. I think Blackrock is the only other big player recently to decrease holdings in a sizable amount. Everyone else is buying."
2021-05-14 19:27:10,wallstreetbets,"Initially because they DPO’d instead of IPO, so the institutions didn’t hype it to make themselves profit. 

Now they have to keep it down so they can buy in and make their money anyway. Most institutions have been increasing their holdings."
2021-05-14 17:22:39,wallstreetbets,They haven’t announced any new government contracts for 2021 and beyond. Hoping it happens soon. They have their current 5 yr one expiring and they were in the bid for another one amongst many other contractors that if they land would be very good news / -10% day
2021-05-14 19:21:19,wallstreetbets,"i didn't check any numbers but since pltr is still a growth company they most likely do not have much debt so cost of equity impacts WACC and the discount rate a lot. Cost of equity for pltr, assuming 2% Risk free rate, a beta of 2 and a Market risk premium of 7% = 16%"
2021-05-14 19:43:02,wallstreetbets,"I’m not saying it’s bad. Most of you got a crash course in options that only experience can teach.

Use your knowledge and gamble like you want to. But not because you believe the company is going to moon, but because you think the price is going to be crazy and you think you can capitalize."
2021-05-14 19:36:17,wallstreetbets,The hell is DPO? Days past ovulation?
2021-05-14 17:26:44,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-05-14 19:44:12,wallstreetbets,"Direct public offering as opposed to Initial public offering. 

Basically they skipped all the fee’s that an IPO would have caused, and with an IPO they would have let the institutions buy in before it went public. 

Instead they DPO’d which let us retail folks get in at the cheaper price and benefit, instead of institutions."
2021-05-14 15:30:41,wallstreetbets,24% of ABNB customers stay for longer than 28 days. They are a residential rental company now
2021-05-14 15:44:55,wallstreetbets,"If only people knew about the lockup date ahead of time and could plan for it, probably has nothing to do with abnb tanking the months before."

2021-05-14 15:30:41,wallstreetbets,Didn’t it come down from 220 ish down to where it is now
2021-05-14 14:07:41,wallstreetbets,"I think it might be priced in already... Also people living their lives and working at a tech company don't necessarily rush to sell their equities the moment they get them.

Personally bullish on the share price from here. The valuation seems steep, and I think there are a few interesting avenues for growth that will moderate that."
2021-05-14 14:59:20,wallstreetbets,"On a reopening play, I think abnb could be good in the sense that it allows you to go on a vacation but not stay in a big building with a bunch of strangers. That said, I’d wait to make that bet until after insiders decide whether to sell or not"
2021-05-14 13:56:59,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. Two things, 1) How can I learn about this 2) How can I capitalize on this? Thanks"
2021-05-14 14:37:47,wallstreetbets,So is ABNB A BUY?
2021-05-14 13:58:57,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-05-14 18:04:32,wallstreetbets,So what is a good price point to buy ABNB?
2021-05-14 14:24:27,wallstreetbets,"How can you be bullish? I'd argue at least half of the world is locked up, no travelling as in 2019..."

2021-05-14 16:00:41,wallstreetbets,Damn dude... did Citadel at least take you out before they fucked you like that?! Sorry for your loss bro.
2021-05-14 15:09:06,wallstreetbets,I feel like this has in the top 10 loss on this sub.
2021-05-14 17:42:41,wallstreetbets,"This ain't seven figures

Edit: NM I'm retarded"
2021-05-14 13:49:40,wallstreetbets,Probably right but probably has a while trading sideways.  DIS+ growth not as strong as the market wants. Might get back in with 23 LEAPS after I am done with slitting my wrists
2021-05-14 14:55:19,wallstreetbets,"I dont get it, why?"
2021-05-14 13:41:17,wallstreetbets,"Holy fook. Sum ting wong 

Lmfao 🤣

How are you feeling right now?"
2021-05-14 13:51:33,wallstreetbets,Starting an OnlyFans instead
2021-05-14 14:48:43,wallstreetbets,We’ve all been there before bud
2021-05-14 14:03:10,wallstreetbets,I tried really really hard
2021-05-14 16:37:46,wallstreetbets,I was tired of watching the stock go down 0.5% every day for the past 3 months.
2021-05-14 13:50:37,wallstreetbets,Will you clean my face off now?
2021-05-14 14:02:50,wallstreetbets,Definitely wont be looking because I don;t have them anymore
2021-05-14 13:48:02,wallstreetbets,Current top comment says he realized the loss...Must've really needed the capital to not let it ride.
2021-05-14 13:59:36,wallstreetbets,I wish you would have told me before
2021-05-14 16:39:11,wallstreetbets,If I get 833k upvotes will that fill the massive monetary hole in my life right now?
2021-05-14 16:41:08,wallstreetbets,I didn’t have enough for the cardboard box suite so are you willing to share the sleeping bag?
2021-05-14 13:59:45,wallstreetbets,Christ!
2021-05-14 13:54:59,wallstreetbets,Ya it’s an honor
2021-05-14 14:45:22,wallstreetbets,Without lube
2021-05-14 13:55:25,wallstreetbets,I hate Doug
2021-05-14 14:01:54,wallstreetbets,Already a mod there thanks
2021-05-14 14:47:36,wallstreetbets,In a way it’s like breaking up with a crappy girlfriend.  I feel relieved that I don;t have to look at that crap in my account.
2021-05-14 14:50:41,wallstreetbets,Found me out
2021-05-14 16:39:50,wallstreetbets,Because getting some money back is better than getting no money back
2021-05-14 16:40:24,wallstreetbets,Good for you. THe mouse has massively underperformed over the past few months.
2021-05-14 16:42:11,wallstreetbets,The weed smokes me
2021-05-14 17:49:23,wallstreetbets,Very possible by the end of the year.  Although COVID might continue to fuck it and Dis+ growth story isnt there yet.  Im keeping shares
2021-05-14 13:52:09,wallstreetbets,You don’t fuck with the mouse the mouse fucks with you.
2021-05-14 18:00:06,wallstreetbets,"He placed a call on Disney, that’s not fucking with the mouse. He got fucked by the mouse"
2021-05-14 14:00:46,wallstreetbets,Not sure it’s my first time trading options
2021-05-14 14:44:46,wallstreetbets,My next play is OnlyFans
2021-05-14 14:45:03,wallstreetbets,Sold them
2021-05-14 14:45:49,wallstreetbets,This guy got fucked by a goddamn mouse
2021-05-14 14:47:50,wallstreetbets,I know right.
2021-05-14 14:50:50,wallstreetbets,Glad I can be of service
2021-05-14 15:07:28,wallstreetbets,Looks like I timed it perfectly and sold at the bottom as well.
2021-05-14 15:07:51,wallstreetbets,Early February.
2021-05-14 15:11:16,wallstreetbets,Yes I agree.
2021-05-14 16:38:23,wallstreetbets,Good luck with that
2021-05-14 16:41:38,wallstreetbets,300% of NW
2021-05-14 17:50:08,wallstreetbets,That bad huh?
2021-05-14 17:51:21,wallstreetbets,I have tons of shares as well.  Still believe in Dis long term. It’ll fly but don’t know when.
2021-05-14 17:16:09,wallstreetbets,It's vanguard. So probably years of working and saving for retirement
2021-05-14 17:52:14,wallstreetbets,Ape stonk
2021-05-14 17:52:59,wallstreetbets,F
2021-05-14 17:54:38,wallstreetbets,"I felt that way about the spring but COVID has proven more resiliant than I thought.  I think options are risky until COVID is over. Might be this summer, might not."
2021-05-14 17:55:14,wallstreetbets,5-10%
2021-05-14 17:59:01,wallstreetbets,That’s why I post to this sub
2021-05-14 17:59:26,wallstreetbets,More like pod destruction
2021-05-14 18:32:39,wallstreetbets,I make 17 dollars an hour and just set up an OnlyFans so I’m good.
2021-05-14 18:31:53,wallstreetbets,Yup.  But got the majority of my money from listening to the retards here.
2021-05-14 18:41:34,wallstreetbets,Got tired of seeing it red in my portfolio every single day.
2021-05-14 19:01:05,wallstreetbets,Mouse took us all to poundtown.
2021-05-14 14:04:03,wallstreetbets,Can you wash my sheets when you are done?
2021-05-14 16:42:47,wallstreetbets,I fucked Citadel earlier this year so I guess we are even
2021-05-14 15:36:05,wallstreetbets,Gotta change the title.. we're simple people here
2021-05-14 17:57:39,wallstreetbets,It’s seven figures
2021-05-14 18:53:04,wallstreetbets,"slit a penis on ur wrist for me xoxo

edit: which one of u madlads gave me an award for telling somebody to kill themselves"
2021-05-14 13:48:00,wallstreetbets,Looks like I can still afford the deluxe cardboard box
2021-05-14 14:10:05,wallstreetbets,And your worst was just good enough.
2021-05-14 17:10:59,wallstreetbets,"You know a lot more than I do, that’s Fer sure. 

Even with it so far out? Isn’t it better to just either watch it get worse or break even at least. 

Is their a more rational (sry) explanation, than I hate red...110% not trying to start shit or anything. 
Just curious wanting to pick your brain a little bit."
2021-05-14 14:03:25,wallstreetbets,Crab... how much did you lose?
2021-05-14 14:03:46,wallstreetbets,600.000? Holy cow
2021-05-14 16:47:38,wallstreetbets,You'll be happy to know that I will brining a bidet to our new residence
2021-05-14 15:01:30,wallstreetbets,"Doug, you know what you are..."
2021-05-14 16:48:48,wallstreetbets,Expiry in 2022 tho?
2021-05-14 18:29:34,wallstreetbets,This man speaks the truth
2021-05-14 16:55:07,wallstreetbets,U really belong here
2021-05-14 16:08:09,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, the Wright Brothers didn’t give up when they first failed. Dust yourself off and get back on that horse. 

Wait, I just realized you dropped 833K on your first options trade. Fuck bro."
2021-05-14 14:13:23,wallstreetbets,Wow I admire your balls
2021-05-14 19:14:37,wallstreetbets,Please tell me you're joking
2021-05-14 15:08:31,wallstreetbets,Why wouldn’t you hold considering how much time there’s left on these?
2021-05-14 17:22:47,wallstreetbets,Wot lol... Be serious bro
2021-05-14 17:52:50,wallstreetbets,Ape stonk
2021-05-14 17:58:41,wallstreetbets,Damn son lol - you self made?
2021-05-14 18:44:38,wallstreetbets,This is the first time I've ever been actually angry at someone for a trade that has nothing to do with me. I hate you.
2021-05-14 14:10:06,wallstreetbets,"nah, I don’t clean a grown ass-man’s sheets.

joking aside, saw you grew $25k + 40k into a hefty fortune, congrats! You’re fine and can FD another day. I’m similar but only up a few mil, started with HELOC funds (now fully paid back)"
2021-05-14 16:36:05,wallstreetbets,To what?
2021-05-14 15:31:07,wallstreetbets,If you're lucky you can get them to throw in a complimentary beggars mug with that deluxe cardboard
2021-05-14 17:46:28,wallstreetbets,I'm shocked. I assume this wasn't all your money?....... right? I 😅
2021-05-14 14:42:20,wallstreetbets,Thanks that means a lot
2021-05-14 17:38:34,wallstreetbets,Problem is options can go to 0 shares typically cannot.  So usually if an options contract hits -50% I bail because I’d rather have some money than no money.  I think Dis is a strong reopening play but I don’t know when they will rally so I’ll keep the shares for now.  Once I see some momentum or once COVID finally seems over I’ll probably get in on 23 LEAPS.
2021-05-14 14:41:50,wallstreetbets,Over 1 million between two accounts
2021-05-14 18:31:46,wallstreetbets,You know......... what you are.....  you know..
2021-05-14 17:47:30,wallstreetbets,Yup could be the wrong desicion but Dis+ has a ways to go and COVID is still a thing in the world
2021-05-14 17:58:05,wallstreetbets,Thanks fam
2021-05-14 14:41:19,wallstreetbets,Wife gonna make her boyfriend gonna chop them off when she finds out
2021-05-14 15:10:34,wallstreetbets,Ill probably grab 23 LEAPS once I see some positive momentum return.
2021-05-14 18:10:58,wallstreetbets,Ape stonk
2021-05-14 14:43:40,wallstreetbets,Gotta take the risk to make the cash
2021-05-14 17:57:02,wallstreetbets,"No some was from my wife, some from my parents, and some from my childrens college fund."
2021-05-14 18:32:18,wallstreetbets,GME made you tendies?
2021-05-14 15:36:36,wallstreetbets,word. best of luck on your next bets!
2021-05-14 17:59:02,wallstreetbets,"That's fine about the children, I've paid my way through on my own. You'll do better next time! 

Just YOLO on LABU next week"
2021-05-14 18:00:25,wallstreetbets,Ya and my wife has a boyfriend and the parents are demented so no one will notice
2021-05-14 18:02:03,wallstreetbets,"Ask your wife's boyfriend for stock advice too, gl"
2021-05-14 13:32:06,wallstreetbets,r/dataisbeautiful well done
2021-05-14 14:08:17,wallstreetbets,"You should check out the posts about a certain metal masquerading as inflation being pushed by certain users. If you go through all the commenters it's certain that the posts are being propped up from another subreddit.

2021-05-14 14:02:57,wallstreetbets,What's the correlation between account age and sentiment?
2021-05-14 15:18:50,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-14 17:56:01,wallstreetbets,Worth deeper analysis
2021-05-14 15:08:47,wallstreetbets,tbh i've been here a day and I can gurantee your theory is flawed -  Gourd Futures and long on Bunnies are perfect plays.
2021-05-14 14:07:36,wallstreetbets,"This is a really good tool.  I think it would be good for moderators to be able to use something like this to flag new accounts with suspicious behavior.  There may not be a lot of people doing this, but it only takes a few accounts with high volume to cause distrust."
2021-05-14 16:23:35,wallstreetbets,"The key takeaway where you've missed the forest for the trees is that GME has disproportionate number of newcomers flooding extremely positive sentiments while more normal users aren't that keen anymore.


Wonder why you did not mention that?"
2021-05-14 13:36:17,wallstreetbets,Pretty impressive for a gorilla
2021-05-14 14:12:48,wallstreetbets,"If you have the time, a great follow-up to this would be a social network graph linking account replies. With all the discussion on bot armies, my assumption would be that bots target the same posts or some correlation between post and sentiment. Ala, a very positive sentiment gets lots of negative sentiment responses."
2021-05-14 17:45:18,wallstreetbets,Thank you sir and much respect. What tool/language do you use for those charts? Very familiar with python and Tableau myself but otherwise need to learn more.
2021-05-14 13:39:30,wallstreetbets,"wow really nice work!   
It's interesting it shows the more one comments the more negative the comments tend to be expecially with GME"

2021-05-14 13:36:46,wallstreetbets,this is beautiful you ape. I hope your wrinkled brain has space for more creases.

2021-05-14 18:00:38,wallstreetbets,All in on JNUG
2021-05-14 16:24:46,wallstreetbets,Like PSLV?
2021-05-14 16:33:15,wallstreetbets,I’m guessing you’re talking about steel? How is it masquerading as inflation when the price of steel is actually going up?
2021-05-14 16:12:33,wallstreetbets,Buying gold isn’t a crime and IAU rocks
2021-05-14 16:39:45,wallstreetbets,"Copper?  How is buying copper a crime?    


Propped up by another subreddit?  You mean like certain retail companies that seem to have multiple subreddits, but spam WSB with ""distraction""?"
2021-05-14 16:14:40,wallstreetbets,Let's turn Everred to Evergreen
2021-05-14 17:57:17,wallstreetbets,"I also think a lot of older members have left, or rarely post."
2021-05-14 18:13:20,wallstreetbets,"Yet the majority of new users are bots not just advocating against but the more common tactic is to push other allegedly shorted stocks for “the next squeeze.” 

Bots are rampant in WSB. Most accounts created on or around Jan 27th and you can easily see them pushing anything else but GME. Hopefully OP can gather some data on that"
2021-05-14 19:35:54,wallstreetbets,"This looks like spam. The mods have been notified.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
2021-05-14 15:34:33,wallstreetbets,I report every single one and even one of the mods commented on the thread saying they were warned like 10 posts ago soo...🤷
2021-05-14 18:12:29,wallstreetbets,Short that shit?
2021-05-14 16:54:30,wallstreetbets,I'd say u/mtw132's comments are sus. Check his history and he's an inflation denier. It could be both steel or silver. Both are plays rn.
2021-05-14 17:14:38,wallstreetbets,An account that suddenly became active and started posting in trading centered subs in the last 30 days making posts in the other subreddit directly linking their post on WSB (which they had posted over 10 times in a single week) for awards and upvotes. Which then gets deleted and repeated again the next day. Nothing sus at all.
2021-05-14 18:27:09,wallstreetbets,"I’m not going to say there aren’t bots. But, I don’t think a majority of them are. People are really just fixated on short squeezes because they like the idea of getting money quickly. Most of them learned about what stocks are 4 months ago. I cannot explain the obsession with GME though. I’m all for being a fan of a company, but it’s a little ridiculous when apes downvote anything not GME."
2021-05-14 15:58:28,wallstreetbets,"This is the reason I didn't close my 12 puts for 2022 I didn't like it then I don't like it now. 

Would love to see the floor open up on them"
2021-05-14 16:58:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’ve just taken a look. I don’t understand how you can deny inflation is happening, there’s official figures all over the world showing it. Not surpassing considering the amount of money that’s been printed."
2021-05-14 18:30:30,wallstreetbets,I don’t think it’s always apes that are downvoting anything non GME. Permission to spam you with the bots I’ve found just in the last day or so?
2021-05-14 19:41:43,wallstreetbets,You may want to close those once the market bottoms out. Silver as an asset will recover
2021-05-14 18:31:05,wallstreetbets,"Granted, and slightly terrified."
2021-05-14 19:51:32,wallstreetbets,They're currently 80% down I'll hold them till even or expiry. It's only money
2021-05-14 19:52:15,wallstreetbets,True enough

2021-05-14 14:06:01,wallstreetbets,Let us know where you will be losing these $46k. I am not even gonna say I will inverse it by buying Puts because then we would both lose.

2021-05-14 19:43:37,wallstreetbets,How were you able to average .40 on a leap? Did you buy them way OTM earlier this year when GPS was at $10? You must have had a really bullish outlook. Either that or you're from the future. Stop cheating future man.
2021-05-14 15:11:52,wallstreetbets,Here I am celebrating $30
2021-05-14 15:48:19,wallstreetbets,why the hell is Gap's ticker GPS lol should just be GAP

When you exercise, don’t you have to pay for the 2500 shares at $17? So the net gain is $4k and change?"

2021-05-14 13:19:20,wallstreetbets,"The big issue here is regulatory.

The other offer from Canadian Pacific is around $275 per share and they have mentioned that they aren't going to raise it further after rival offer from Canadian National at $325.

Since this is about railroads, regulatory approval is the key issue here more than anything as US doesn't need further consolidation leading to monopolies.

Surface transport Board(STB) who is responsible for regulatory approval, has in principle, agreed that merger of KSU with CP is ok, as it will still be the smallest class one railway even after merger.

The decision for KSU with CN is still pending and is more difficult to get approval 

Only if that approval goes through, KSU can be bought by CN at $325, else they have to accept CP's only offer at $275

So this isn't a straight forward arbitrage opportunity, the stock can even tank to $275, depending of STB's decision"

2021-05-14 14:06:16,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for doing more research than I did. That's a solid point on the regulatory front (my opinion was just an opinion about regulatory). I believe CP has 5 days to respond to make a counter offer. If they don't up the offer, maybe that shows they think a regulatory decision will go their way. If they try to match or beat the bid, then game on. Maybe best to wait until mid-week to see what move CP makes"
2021-05-14 13:14:10,wallstreetbets,Good bot
2021-05-14 14:28:23,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I too will prefer waiting for mid-next week. KSU seems to have accepted the CN offer yesterday, just to start the stopwatch on CP and get them to bid more in the next 5 days.

KSU too don't have confidence that STB will approve CN offer, but if they pressure CP and get a bid of say $300/Share, and then even STB rejects CN offer, KSU is still better off with new CP bid at $300 rather than older bid at $275. 
I doubt CP can match CN for full value due to debt CP will need to take. But even if gives a bit lower offer, KSU will still consider it as STB is already ok with it

So its all about how CP reacts"

ASML, AMAT, KLAC, KLIC, LRCX

This will not help NVDA, QCOM, or AMD until new fab capacity is online (so end of 2022 at the earliest).  Once more fab capacity has been created, the chip designers should benefit from lower contract manufacturing prices."

2021-05-14 14:09:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, AMD’s fab is taiwanese. You have a point. but still, AMD is US company. It means they may benefit from the support as well. Besides, US can probably be ok with supporting TSMC. It is good to see strong Taiwanese companies against China. and TSMC opening a new fab in Phoenix.

In short. This support should help also AMD, but probably not as much as Intel."

Insiders own 12.85% of that float and institutions own 24.50%, which together is 37.35%. For those of you who never graduated from elementary school, that's 31.27m shares, which makes the free float 51.45 million shares.

Of that, 11.88m shares are short (as of 04/29) which is 23% of the free float. That's important, but not in and of itself enough to squeeze. (Addendum: It is certainly higher now than it was on 04/29, because as of TODAY there are zero shares available to short).

Options volume for 05/21 is huge - between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are approx. 205,500 calls, all out of the money. Their average delta is about 10% (according to Schwab), meaning that as they become ITM, 18.5m shares will be automatically bought by brokers to cover those calls. This is a gamma ramp - it will happen linearly if the stock ticks upwards, creating a positive feedback loop of rising price until they are entirely hedged. At the same time, shorts must cover if the price rises (or must they?). That means that IF the price rises significantly, nearly 30 million shares must be bought in the next 7 days to cover - that's **57% of all the shares available!**

Holy fuck.

Also on Wednesday the stock experienced an extremely sudden 10% surge (when everything else was in a multi-day freefall) and it hasn't gone back down."

2021-05-14 13:01:17,wallstreetbets,"I understand your point and reasoning. I am not trying to convince you. Only thing I want to say is, comparing RKT to UWM is like comparing apple and orange. They are not the same just because they both deal with mortgage. Excuse me for not bringing the best example, Warby Parker and Luxottica are not the same just because they deal with eyewear.

You will have a better understanding once you fully understand the nature of UWM’s business as a “wholesale” company.

Unlike RKT, UWM’s revenue does not heavily rely on refi sales and the interest rate. I am not saying rate increase will not impact. It will be minimal compared to other retailers. UWM is a mortgage wholesale company. Their revenue is growing not just because of the historically low interest rate. You are just looking the part of it, not the whole picture.

I forgot to mention about the ultimatum. Now brokers dealing with UWM are exclusively dealing with UWM and it will increase the revenue.

Biden’s proposal of long term capital gain increase will demotivate long term investment of non dividends paying companies like alphabet and amazon. Those money can move to real estate. I expect increasing demand of real estate due to inevitable inflation. (We’ve been printing too much $$$.) All of them will positively impact the demand in real estate boom.

I strongly urge you to check out the most recent earnings call on May 11th. You will have a better understanding of UWMC."

UWMC as a company had a good track record before going public and continues to deliver good results after going public.

At the current prices, it pays almost a 6% dividend, if I end up bag holding my shares it'll pay me back over time plus the premiums I can make selling CC.

To me, it's a safe YOLO that can actually pay off, and in the event it doesn't, I don't risk losing all my money like a lot of the other YOLO's I see on here."

That's going to help."

2021-05-14 16:47:23,wallstreetbets,The entire housing market is a fucking meme right now. Tons of meme potential for Millenials to meme how it takes a literal lottery ticket in options to afford a house.

2021-05-14 16:13:19,wallstreetbets,Show me the data that everyone relied last year?  Because I would venture to be that is simply not even close to being true.
2021-05-14 13:19:29,wallstreetbets,Honestly I hope you all get the 🚀 like you want.  I like seeing people with big gains even if I wasn't on them.  Good luck to you all.
2021-05-14 16:34:30,wallstreetbets,"I refi'd last year and it took 4 months longer than normal because the system was so overwhelmed.  Rates went 1-3% lower than previous years.  That always leads to a boom in refi's (sites below).  In the initial RKT surge last summer, there were a lot of news stories about people refinancing and the high demand.  The issue is that rates can't go lower unless we go to a negative rate like some European countries are testing.  

Who knows what will happen but this industry is 100% dependent on interest rates.  I'd be worried about that risk as an investor, especially with inflation heating up.  One hint of higher rates and all mortgage stocks will selloff like crazy.  If inflation keeps going up, the FED will be forced to raise rates.

2021-05-14 13:34:41,wallstreetbets,Thanks!  I'm not that smart either.  Probably should have kept my opinion to myself.  I'm always looking for new plays but mortgages or anything dependent on interest rates staying low in order to keep their current volume is not a play I will make.

2021-05-14 15:41:47,wallstreetbets,I think that is a good sign. It tells me management know's how to communicate through different mediums and not just boomer media. Furthermore that shows me balls. You know redditors can be assholes so.

In one of those scoundrel written reports about them, they highlighted part of the article that said not many doctors use them...then the very first line after the highlighted part it literally says the office managers use the clover assistant every single day to input the doctors notes and then they fax it to clover. These reports are scaring so many people away, just like they want. They'll buy up all the cheap shares and sell them back to the paper hand for $12 next week and the week after"
2021-05-14 14:08:54,wallstreetbets,"Just curious as to what the tech does. So, the tech supposedly helps doctors make better decisions, but it is only used by office admins?"
2021-05-14 16:31:25,wallstreetbets,"Yes it’s used by PCP’a aka the doctors, not ‘office admins’ and yes it uses AI to go through entire patient history and give the best clinical recommendation - this also helps them ultimately reduce liability costs"
2021-05-14 14:23:07,wallstreetbets,It helps organize data and uses ai to suggest better methods of treating patients in real time. It makes total sense that all the doctors notes go in it and it makes even more sense that the doctor would get an office administrator to input it. The point is that it's being used everyday. It's possible the doctor doesn't know the brand or company of every product they use

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I’m bull on ABNB There are few stocks that I actually do extensive research on, normally I just kinda throw money at stuff and hope for the best. But the few stocks that I have put research into are because I feel they were either going to make a strong comeback post COVID or I felt they were a strong yet underrated investment. XOM was a stock I researched heavily and felt it was massively undervalued at $34 a share over a year ago, that has been a great long hold because of its strong dividend. RCL was my quick gain play, I put a third of my total investment in and came out well over double. I have now moved all of that to ABNB, I have liked the company from before it even went public, they are the kings of their sector and “AirBNB” is a term many use just for simply renting a house, it is a name everyone knows and has became accustom with. That sector is rapidly growing and I feel they have the best grasp on it. Recently the stock has had a massive pull back and put it in pricing that I have taken advantage of because I feel it’s a steal for where they are headed. I’m currently holding 85 shares @ an average of 158 a share. 
What are your thoughts on ABNB?"
2021-05-14 11:59:41,wallstreetbets,"I am bull on ABNB as well... Only thing I wonder is if I have to wait more than a year to see a big surge. Anyway, it is about 15% of my portfolio."
2021-05-14 16:10:13,wallstreetbets,"I’m long AirBnB, have been before they were public. I’ll likely own them for a decade at least pending some drastic unforeseen change. 

Maybe it’s because I’m a millennial but my generation just doesn’t even go to hotels when planning travel. The only hotels I’ve stayed in for the last decade have been for business, weddings, or because it was a diiiiiiirt cheap necessity in a desperate situation. 

If AirBnB starts making corporate connections and let’s me book them for the rare business trip over hotels? Sign me the fuck up. I’ll take the cozy cottage with a sauna a five minute Uber away over the downtown hotel any day. Hell, last time a group of us went to SLC for a conference we did an AirBnB as it was way cheaper for the group to split over a hotel. 

I’m looking at the macro trends ahead to take all equities down and plan on averaging down over the next few months. Where you’ll see real momentum start to build is this winter and into 2022."
2021-05-14 15:26:45,wallstreetbets,Summary: why you're bull on Airbnb is because you like the stock.
2021-05-14 12:34:26,wallstreetbets,It was 34 a year ago and fell to 34 in October. Ummm looks like you are both correct. 🍸

OP can claim they called a price, but its hard to verify without proof. It was $34 5 months ago. How do I know? Because I have proof via screenshots that I called the bottom. My post history will show I called the bottom. If you are going to claim you called the bottom on something and are telling people to buy after a shitty earnings release, please post a screenshot of proof that you called the bottom."

2021-05-14 16:23:42,wallstreetbets,"I can totally agree with that statement, I’ve used AirBNB for groups and as you said you get way more than a hotel can offer for less per person. Another thing that got me locked in is when I’ve been hearing 65+ year olds talk about doing an AirBNB instead of a hotel. I know younger people love the idea but sometimes the older generation is harder to sway but it seems to be a concept that is excepted by all generations."

I averaged at 140/share and bought when IPO released. Saw it go all the way up to 210 and now back to 140. 

I'll buy in again if it drops, thinking maybe 130/120??? If not I'll buy back at 140. I wasnt going to sell initially but the price decline and ER response makes it feel like there is a pending selloff from insiders trying to cashout."
2021-05-14 18:43:59,wallstreetbets,Because smart insiders/prior shareholders aren't selling on Monday.  I know because I'm one of them

2021-05-14 12:38:24,wallstreetbets,"Too easy to photoshop, but it is pretty easy to provide proof. Why not just post a screenshot? Considering this is your first post and you are making some drastic claims, I would say you should provide proof. Otherwise I would double down on this being fake.        

If I post proof of me recommending people buy the stock at $34 will you drink a pee martini?"
2021-05-14 13:06:38,wallstreetbets,"I don’t give two flying shits if you recommend XOM @ $34. You slapped up “Fake Post” on this thread saying I’m lying that I didn’t buy XOM @ $34 per share over a year ago. 
You are trying to defend yourself acting like some Wallstreetbets prophet claiming that you “called the bottom @ $34” and told everyone to buy it. 
So… will you drink a pee martini if I can not only prove that I bought XOM @ $34 over a year ago but bought it @ $31 over a year ago as well? Which would also mean you didn’t call the bottom. Come on TreeHugChamp, you know you are right, what do you have to lose?

2021-05-14 14:29:52,wallstreetbets,Why would I agree to something someone can easily photoshop? At this point even if you did post “proof” I wouldn’t believe it because anyone could’ve photoshopped a photo by now. If you really want to go proof or ban we can ask a mod.
2021-05-14 14:49:04,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate you thinking I’m smart enough to use photoshop but I’m sorry to disappoint you that I don’t know how. So sure, if the argument is still that you don’t believe I bought XOM for $34 a share over a year ago then I’m good with a proof or ban."

2021-05-14 16:09:52,wallstreetbets,"2021 update:

“It is a pleasure [to be here]… Your studio looks smaller in person.

Now it's true that many investors have fared poorly in the recent downturn, but there are also plenty of people out there who are managing to ride this thing out by using a thing called diversification: spreading out all of your investments. Let me show you what I mean here. *chart*

You see here that stocks are down 34 points over a two-year period. People who invested in commodities did slightly better and while Treasury notes are down, one group of investors is doing well: the super-rich. They're actually doing great!

Now we don't have the bar graph technology to show you how high their portfolios have risen but if you look out of the window of our offices you'll get some idea. [Their bar] is about six stories taller. 

You see, by starting with lots and lots and lots of money you can still fall back on your gigantic wad even if you lose some.

I recommend Old Money. Once it's been in the family a while it's just about impossible to lose it. Even if you are a complete Fuckup!

Now, I'm looking at you Gabriel Plotkin…

**JS**: What about the people who don't have huge fortunes though?

Well Jon, they should have planned ahead. Now is no time not to
be rich. You have to get creative. Think outside the box. Consider meme stocks. Yes there is a lot of junk out there but for those of you who do your homework, opportunities abound.

For example, take a look at this mint condition collection of AMC calls. Isn't that gorgeous? These calls print on some arbitrary day that has no relation to financial performance and allows AMC to continue using retail investors as a literal ATM! I mean, who knows what these calls could be worth in a couple of years?!

**JS**: But- but Steve I think people looking at more traditional investment instruments such as real estate... 

Okay well the housing market lags the economy so real estate could be in for a rough ride. But these calls- I mean just look at them! Each one bought on margin from the most ironically named brokerage ever!

Jon, what do you think these calls would go for retail?

**JS**: 20 bucks?

More like 9000! But for a limited time they can be yours for only $299! $299 . That's less than $300 for calls that you and your family will cherish as it goes up and up and up in value! Jon, I am rating these calls an official stonk and a strong Buy!

**JS**: Hey that- that's very nice. But we're trying to focus on sound investments here…

Okay! All right, I know who I am dealing with here. You are a savvy investor! Fine, I will throw in this collection of commemorative stonks including BB, NOK, & CLOV! 

**JS**: Steve, oh I don't want to interrupt. Don't you collect this stuff? Is- aren't these just your personal bags? 

….

No. No. No NO NO NO! I need the cash! I had everything in GME! I need $50,000 by Friday or they're gonna repossess the PT Cruiser! *I LOVE THAT CAR* …It's new but it looks old. How cool is that?!"

2021-05-14 17:51:57,wallstreetbets,"i agree, i would say trump is a very hard president to write comedy about because so much about him breaks the presidential norms (not in the sense that there isnt material, but hard to phrase it without shitting on him) ,  but all of the talk shows became less funny because it came across less about the jokes, and more about the politics.

If you're pro trump you dont want to watch comedians shitting on your boy (at least the same way they do on the news) , if you're against trump, you dont want the punchline of all the jokes to be essentially.. oh he's so corrupt and dumb and evil!!! that will just depress you.  If you're watching comedy you want to escape from the news , not watch an extension of it.

Just because we have  mass shootings every day doesnt mean we have to let late show monologues be one of the victims.  I think it was a fine needle and stewart and letterman knew how to play it.   If you want to comment on the politics of the day,  it should probably be through satire, otherwise you're just hannity or coumo.

most of the jokes need to be more about choking on pretzels, dodging shoes, injecting bleach.  politicians being corrupt isnt a punchline, everyone basically already gets that.

could you even imagine the colbert report during the trump presidency???"
2021-05-14 16:48:24,wallstreetbets,"There is nothing wrong with political comedy. It just has to be funny and witty. Stewart used to have it. Colbert had it for awhile, the character got sort of old. There is nothing funny about Trevor Noah. He is basically Rachael Maddox with a laugh track."

I feel like blue has become bluer, red has become redder, and although purple is growing as far as public appeal, what actually happens in the voting booth is even more divisive than before, and it's all identity politics."

2021-05-14 17:14:22,wallstreetbets,I like him in his personal rants. But I don't see his show as must see tv. Back in the Stewart days his show and ESPN's top 10 plays were the must-see tv on my TiVo every morning.
2021-05-14 18:31:46,wallstreetbets,tbf when Steward was first out I was in my first job out of college and still a liberal. Maybe that's the difference idk but even now as an anti trump conservative I think Trevor sucks and purposely change the channel when he pops on.

2021-05-14 17:16:49,wallstreetbets,"Oh he’s no Stewart. But Stewart also had like decades of experience and commitment to the program. Noahs still a baby in comparison.

Why buy now?

1. Best in class CEO - Ganzi has raised close to $40B from some of the largest institutional funds and investors in the world IN THIS SECTOR. He has been in the Digital Infra field for more than 25 years and understands the connections & synergies between fiber, towers, small cell, data centers etc and is able to connect all the dots. This creates huge cross selling opportunities. Plus Ganzi will receive a well deserved 10M share bonus once CLNY trades over $10 per share for 90 days.
2. CLNY still is being valued as a transitional and traditional commercial RE REIT. Once Wall Street recognizes this DI pure play, the valuation multiple will greatly expand beyond it's peers. The key differentiator between Colony Capital and its competitors, is that [Colony is the only provider that can deliver end-to-end digital infrastructure](https://dgtlinfra.com/colony-capital-2020-review-and-2021-outlook/). Specifically, Colony Capital is investing in all four segments of digital infrastructure, in its core market of the United States.
3. CLNY is positioned to focus on the four key sectors of digital infrastructure. These include towers, data centers, fiber and small cells & distributed antenna systems. Colony is particularly poised to capitalize on secular themes such as the digital infrastructure behind 5G technology. As Marc Ganzi famously said: “the dinner bill for 5G is coming… and it’s expensive”.
4. The DI Cap Ex explosion that 5G will create over the next 5-10 years is enormous.  Global interconnection bandwidth is forecast to grow at a 45% CAGR—translating to 16,300+ terabits per second (Tbps).
5. Industries are shifting gears to adapt to global change. As digitization increases, installed capacities are forecast to grow at a tremendous rate for industries across regions. "

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Yolo hanging on strong....PLTR

2021-05-14 12:16:14,wallstreetbets,I’d sell covered calls every week if I was you. I have 300 shares and I sell 3 contracts making minimum $100-$250 a week just holding this bag of depression

2021-05-14 11:44:59,wallstreetbets,Is it true that the heavier the bags the more ripped you become holding them?
2021-05-14 11:39:22,wallstreetbets,I keep hoping someone that bought in the 30s shows up

2021-05-14 16:27:12,wallstreetbets,Feel it. Burned a lot of us I’m sure. I have pretty good scars from xmas 2020.
2021-05-14 14:57:32,wallstreetbets,"Yah as someone who sells 190 calls on my 19,000 shares I call BS. 

I usually sell $2-3 out of the money and avg about 1700-2200

No way he’s selling 3 contracts and pulling that amount unless he’s buying at the money and it’s dropping each week."
2021-05-14 15:00:45,wallstreetbets,I never said I’m selling calls super OTM. I sell calls close to ITM and get a decent premium out of it. Also $100-$250 of weekly premium for selling 3 covered calls comes out to be 0.33-0.83 per contract.
2021-05-14 17:31:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah dude that shit is crazy hahaha.
I’d be happy with $50 within the next two years. I’m also a big long term PLTR bull"
2021-05-14 18:06:10,wallstreetbets,"See, your mistake is using logic. 

You’ll see some movement once they they announce contracts from Biden’s cyber security/infrastructure push. Palantir is best in class for supply chain management, which is a pressure point that’s been pushed on since the pandemic started."

2021-05-14 11:32:45,wallstreetbets,"Hydrogen fuel cells remind me of nuclear power.

Even though nuclear power is the most effective form of power generation with the smallest negative footprint on the environment and ecosystem, everyone tries to keep it down and only call out one or two short comings.

Hydrogen fuel cells are:

1. Cleanest emissions out of all forms of fuel.

2. Greener than batteries as there is no need to dispose of them.

3. Can have a higher output than batteries.

4. With the proper infrastructure, you can fill up in 5-10 minutes rather than 30mins - 1hour for batteries.

5. We are nearing being able to effectively use solar and wind to power the process of electrolysis to separate hydrogen from oxygen, which would make the fuel for the cells 100% emissions free.

6. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. (Insert angry oil company lobbyist right here)

7. Solar powered homes could one day provide power to homes during the day, while at the same time provide the power for electrolysis to make its own hydrogen fuel for a generator to power the home during the night. Goodbye batteries that we can’t dispose of, and that have a limited amount of resources.


Hell, the military was looking into Chevy trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells to use in the dessert. One of the reasons; the soldiers could literally drink the emissions as it’s pure h2o."
2021-05-14 14:59:50,wallstreetbets,I love PLUG
2021-05-14 17:00:37,wallstreetbets,Pls save my $36 July ICLN calls. They've been worthless since like January.
2021-05-14 11:33:55,wallstreetbets,My dong just got hard
2021-05-14 19:27:38,wallstreetbets,"u/JakTravis_u_SOB

That is why I bought a ton of PLUG shares when they were $3. I have not sold any shares. I don't regret it since I know PLUG can climb back up to $50 range. When Texas had the severe snow storm a few months ago, I was laughing when Governor Greg Abbott blamed the snow storm on clean energy such as Hydrogen Fuel Cell and wind turbines.

Hydrogen Fuel Cell is going to play a big part in clean energy/renewal energy. Companies like Toyota are already investing in Fuel Cell for their fuel cell cars to compete with Tesla. I'm not sure if gasoline will be around forever but we saw what can happen like in the east coast with the gas shortage. The pictures of people getting gas and using paper bags as containers frighten me on what could happen in the future"
2021-05-14 11:37:03,wallstreetbets,Well to actually be able to drink that water they have to put in some impurities...
2021-05-14 15:35:22,wallstreetbets,"Look up the efficiency of hydrogen. The creation process and use is highly inefficient when compared to straight electricity.
Any time there are extra steps in a process, it gets less efficient. Inevitably batteries will be faster to charge, and if not, swap them out for new ones."
2021-05-14 11:44:54,wallstreetbets,"Shit has been around for a long ass time and lost out vs batteries for a reason.

Google ""why hydrogen fuel cells were a failure"" or somethin"
2021-05-14 16:02:42,wallstreetbets,"Ok but how about we stop destroying the environment with lithium batteries until that point, literally every part of a hydrogen fuel cell car is identical to a battery ev, except for the means of power storage, all the motor technology can be straight transfered over"

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Too many people being short on ARKK. I see a short squeeze opportunity with a potential of massive gains if we all buy in. ARKK can easily surpass its previous ATH and moon to $200. I’m going all in. 🚀🦍

2021-05-14 11:02:27,wallstreetbets,Good luck with $200. I would exit if hits $120.

Side note, anyone else sick of 90% of DD these days being squeeze related?"
2021-05-14 11:09:39,wallstreetbets,"Sure. But if ARK keeps taking losing positions, their ETFs will show shit results. Kathie is slowly losing her relevance and people are seeing that she's a one-hit wonder."

2021-05-14 11:03:07,wallstreetbets,"Good choice. Ruft Place. Right time. Short Data supports the thesis. ARK has some really awesome investments. Even if this doesn’t squeeze hard immediately, you will be a long term winner."

2021-05-14 11:10:51,wallstreetbets,Shouldn’t we maybe put it into AMC then move to ARKK after the squeeze? Asking for a friend.

2021-05-14 17:54:34,wallstreetbets,"It’s not about Reddit, it’s driven by the market. Summer overlapping the lift on mask mandate. On top, what’s the percentage do you recall on GME"

2021-05-14 17:03:11,wallstreetbets,We own 70 percent of the float and without naked shorts there’s about 90 million plus shorted shares I think that sounds pretty good
2021-05-14 18:02:38,wallstreetbets,"GME based on game VS AMC in entertaining (including movie theaters), a more extensive industry for biz. It’s out of the question if AMC could replicate the same as GME did but timing."

2021-05-14 12:06:39,wallstreetbets,I’m dying with my GME

So so many houses can be bought for dirt cheap...... but don’t listen to me cause I’m just gonna paper hand and buy a Lamborghini once I hit 350k"

2021-05-14 15:05:19,wallstreetbets,Nobody knows what it’s going to hit....what we do know is this...if everyone holds their stock the price will continue to rise. Of course there will be market manipulation along the way but it will go up!

2021-05-14 17:16:42,wallstreetbets,That is pretty good! Search GME for those same factors and you'll see why it's a much better version of the same situation.
2021-05-14 18:15:17,wallstreetbets,"I think the stars aligned much better for GameStop. If AMC had a new promising CEO and a promising streaming platform on the way then I could see the potential. In addition, gamestops float is far smaller."

2021-05-14 16:10:22,wallstreetbets,"I hope you're not honestly looking for advice on reddit into the stock market where everyone is trying to make a profit ... If you sell your shares before I do, I may make less. Why would you believe anyone is giving you honest advice?"
2021-05-14 11:12:36,wallstreetbets,"I'd say depending on what your cost average is and if you're low around the 5-6$ range and have a decent amount of shares then why not sell now. If you want to risk it and ride the day then hold and see where it ends up at. Your call.

Edit: lol at all the folks salty down voting me. Must be bag holders."

2021-05-14 19:19:17,wallstreetbets,i am selling at $100
2021-05-14 17:18:24,wallstreetbets,Wasn’t comparing but just stating that amc is also looking pretty good too one squeezes and the other squeezes right after
2021-05-14 13:21:44,wallstreetbets,GME is still selling at a discount. There's still time to board the rocket before liftoff. 💎🤚🏻🚀🚀🚀🌛
2021-05-14 18:03:55,wallstreetbets,That’s a very different kind of game 😳
2021-05-14 17:23:00,wallstreetbets,This a stock that should be trading in the 20s regularly 50$ isn’t a squeeze
2021-05-14 19:27:45,wallstreetbets,"yep, i'm a leech on my gf account, but that shit they charge is pure robbery.

2021-05-14 15:48:03,wallstreetbets,You must be new around here...
2021-05-14 15:39:23,wallstreetbets,Very well could but there are many factors that go into this play.

2021-05-14 17:29:38,wallstreetbets,You’re right and because after the pandemic when things started to clear up people would see how much  movie theatres are under appreciated and would invest for a future turn around which would happen due to the slowly increasing attendance due to people missing going out
2021-05-14 13:34:09,wallstreetbets,"""You hold until we tell you to sell""

2021-05-14 11:54:06,wallstreetbets,"If you bought shares why not just hold? You’ve been in for this long, just wait for a few earnings and make a nice profit. I don’t get these questions, what do you mean “what should I do?” 😂

Now me, I’m sitting on a cool 100 May 21 $11c, I’m the one in a dilemma."
2021-05-14 11:14:42,wallstreetbets,The consensus price target is $12-15. Hold! Might not happen this month but it'll happen eventually.
2021-05-14 16:43:57,wallstreetbets,The floor is pretty clearly at 7.20~ so good luck if you didn’t get the dip yesterday
2021-05-14 14:07:46,wallstreetbets,I have 200 May 21 $7.5C. Hoping for a great ER
2021-05-14 14:10:25,wallstreetbets,"For real. You only lose when you sell stocks. Surely shutting your eyes for 6-18 months is a better option than selling now.

2021-05-14 11:25:03,wallstreetbets,"I still believe in earning to crush this bull theory. Might not get the gamma squeeze we want but I still think we can hit 12 afterearnings.

2021-05-14 17:40:13,wallstreetbets,What does the consensus price target have to do with the stick price?
2021-05-14 19:20:36,wallstreetbets,"Congrats on your quarter mil! I’m seeing price targets of $13-22, so $20 gets you there."
2021-05-14 16:42:05,wallstreetbets,Those could be up 500% on Monday my dude.
2021-05-14 17:54:11,wallstreetbets,"Well nothing only that market analysts (JPMorgan Chase & Co. & Citi etc) believe it would be fairly valued with a stock price ~$12. 
So owning stock under that price doesn’t seem bad so long as you can afford to wait long enough to see the market reflect that price. 

I imagine most analysts will produce new price targets after ER which could be higher or lower though."
2021-05-14 19:27:23,wallstreetbets,Yea only if it's springs to 20 a share BY THE 21st.
2021-05-14 19:48:58,wallstreetbets,MVIS went up $14 in 5 days last month. Anything’s possible with volume.
2021-05-14 19:52:24,wallstreetbets,True.  But volume has been garbage lately

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Deep Value Biotech Play MYOV THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING

https://preview.redd.it/hr6qof99e3z61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=510837b9021d59e04e722af5631daaaf542ac407

OK Retards, first a bit about Myovant's product : If I told you that the same drug could be used to treat prostate cancer in men and uterine fibroids and endometriosis in women you’d think I was full of shit.  But that is exactly what Myovant is offering with their drug Relugolix.  Those conditions are worsened by estrogen and testosterone so this drug blocks the signal your brain sends out to make them.  Its what’s called a GNRH antagonist and is a once daily pill. The best treatment now is called Lupron which is an injection that is an agonist so instea of blocking the signal it does the opposite and keeps firing the signal repeatedly until your body says fuck it and refuses to make any more.  This difference means symptoms actually get worse before they get better including making people feel like shit with hot flashes and worsening the prostate cancer and takes way longer to start working.  The big kicker is that there was 54% less cardiac events like heart attacks with Myov’s Relugolix than Lupron and actually that kills more men with prostate cancer than the cancer itself.  In women the drug is combined with the two drugs of a birth control pill and eliminates your natural estrogen and progesterone which are probably way too high to give you back a proper amount.  Pretty impressive results that were published in the New England Journal of Medicine twice and in women it avoids the bone loss that has plagued earlier attempts at this. TLDR: Good drug published in the world's most prestigious medical journal twice with less badness and more goodness than current treatments.

Here is where the deep value play comes in. What is this worth?  I’m an ER doc I don’t have a fucking clue how to value a pharma company but you know does?  The M&A department of Pfizer who gave Myovant a 4.2 billion dollar partnership for half of Relugolix at the end of last year including $850 million that doesn’t depend on selling a single drug.  So the company should be worth at least $8.4 billion right?  They also havea phase 2 fertility drug but throw that in for free.  So what’s the current market cap?  $1.87 billion with a just over $20 current price.  Hell Pfizer could have bought the whole company for cheaper and offered well double the current price.  Why the disconnect?  Ah there’s the rub and the opportunity that lies within because of it.

Myovant is 54% ownded by a Japanese Pharma company, Sumitomo.  It was bought along with 4 other companies that also end in Vant with each of the other 4 being 100% owned by them with Urovant most recently with a deal that just closed.  The writing is on the wall that Myovant is next to be bought and with the stock trading this cheap I can’t imagine that taking long.  The Sumi CEO has said multiple times that this is a $1 billion a year product and you would think he would want to lowball the value to be able to make a cheaper offer (mind you this was in Japanese to a group of Japanese investment advisors but there is an English translation)  If you are wavering in your decision to buy I recommend watching  [https://www.irwebmeeting.com/ds-pharma/vod/20210323/c52w8qkv/sumitovant\_02\_en/index.html](https://www.irwebmeeting.com/ds-pharma/vod/20210323/c52w8qkv/sumitovant_02_en/index.html) It’s 2.5 hours where Sumi talks like they already fully own Myovant and are talking up its potential and the role they see in its future.  This is a company that is scared shitless about pretty much their only blockbuster drug going off patent very soon and Myovant is there to plug the gap.  Sumi just reported earnings and has 2 billion in cash on the balance sheet which is a million more than last year – hmm what could that be for?  And they are going to have way less R&D expenses as their cancer drugs have experienced a string of failures and are being abandoned.

So how to play this?  Shares may give a 100% return after being bought out which may be imminent.  Another potential catalyst is runup for FDA approval of Relugolix. Given this runup the alternative is the Full YOLO:  The May Options.  They expire in a week so 5 trading days for magic to happen so you could imagine that they are preposterously cheap.  Two ways to play this:  The 17.5 calls are basically trading for only a small premium on what the stock is trading for (strike price plus option price) so you could leverage up and control a shitload of shares for a week or go full YOLO and load up on some Lotto Calls like the 22.5, 25 or 30.

I  know you retards are way too illiterate to read this A1 DD so TL;DR: In our late economic cycle MYOV headed for a huge acquisition and will be bought out at any time for likely more than double the current share price. Can't go tits up.  

# 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-05-14 10:13:34,wallstreetbets,He said deep value.   I'm in.
2021-05-14 10:32:40,wallstreetbets,"Pharma companies with unreleased products seem to always be “on the brink” and they’ll only always announce “promising” news for obvious reasons. Always always always a risky play. 

But I’m just as tarded as everyone."
2021-05-14 12:58:38,wallstreetbets,"This is a good write up that captures a lot of what is going on. Stock twits board has a surprising amount of really great DD on it as well (for it being stock twits)

I would also add in 3 points.

First, the company has recently announced earnings and proven to Wall Street that they can commercialize and that demand for their product is no issue. They have Pfizer’s sales team and their own pushing the drug. This is HUGE for uptake. If you check their ER presentation you will get a full hard on, guaranteed.

Second and possibly more important is that there are a lot of catalysts coming up still.

Next week: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe 

June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application 

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some smaller markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment.

Third: institutional ownership is massive! I am not wanting to spend the time with a bunch of numbers, but altogether retail only holds about 5-7%. The big boys bought this up for a reason. They know where it’s headed and that it’s a cash cow. Right now, estimates are in the billions for annual sales within a few years.

All in all, the list here is long, I have done tons of research and this is my largest position. The fact that there is a buyout possible is a huge bonus. I think that this is a solid play and as a result have almost 25k shares, 250 calls, and have communicated directly with the company IR department multiple times."
2021-05-14 13:24:20,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion, this could not be more of a sure thing: **MYOV's drug is a pill that cures cancer** \- specifically prostate cancer. I have a friend who is a urologist and he is VERY excited to use this pill for his patients. In simple terms, this drug puts the original IV cancer treatment into a pill (who would prefer to have a needle in their arm if they could take a pill?).

On top of this prostate cancer medication, we will know on June 1st whether this product can be used to treat uterine fibroids. If it is approved, this will be ground breaking for the field of medicine - especially since the most common way to remove uterine fibroids is surgery. 

MYOV is ripe for an increase.

1- Have there been any disclosures about how the tiered payments from Pfizer work? Are these types of agreements usually reasonable (so not making sales an unreachable target)? It would be nice to have the details in an attempt to value the agreement. 

2- You referenced estimates in the billions. Is that for all use cases or just prostate cancer? Do you have any research available on market size. I see info on amount of patients that need this type of drug a year. Not sure how to model that into a $ amount. 

3- If the drug is truly so much better than the alternatives, is it extremely likely that it will own almost all its markets (or at least for prostate cancer)? Even though it is better than the alternatives, could other factors get in the way of it owning most of the market share?"

The gain was forcing bearish investors out of their positions, according to one analyst who watches short-sellers.
AMC last traded at $13.28 after rising as high as $14.34 earlier in the session, with volume 2.5 times the 10-day moving average and the stock the most-heavily traded on all exchanges.

2021-05-14 14:13:53,wallstreetbets,I thought the CEO said he wasn’t going to do this
2021-05-14 14:47:09,wallstreetbets,AMC to the moon. 🚀🚀
2021-05-14 19:18:24,wallstreetbets,WSB is literally saving these companies who would have went bankrupt otherwise. History being made.
2021-05-14 12:38:58,wallstreetbets,AMC MUDDA FUKKAS
2021-05-14 11:43:46,wallstreetbets,Disney reporting dramatically slowed subscriber growth on Disney+ is a really good sign for AMC's future. The mouse and AMC had a co-dependency before the pandemic and now it appears that pandemic subscriber growth was not sustainable enough to break that co-dependency.
2021-05-14 15:07:28,wallstreetbets,Inb4 the 500 million new share issuance is back on the table because the CEO got greedy
2021-05-14 18:03:47,wallstreetbets,"Let’s absolutely destroy these AMC short sellers.. I mean like completely trap them in a fully leveraged AMC short. After May 28th once Quiet place 2 and Cruella Open, the box office will be phenomenal!!  And when F9 opening in June we will see a 100m+ domestic box office, 1st weekend."
2021-05-14 10:57:56,wallstreetbets,Look at the 3 month chart of AMC. Based on the pattern there is resistance at 15. In my non proffesional retarded opinion puts are the way to go on this.
2021-05-14 10:25:18,wallstreetbets,"I wish they would have waited till we hit at least 20 to cash out or even higher , not good for our cause and the HOLD line , hope Adam does not cut himself a bonus check from this , seems like all the CEO's do just this after a sell off , would have been happier if he bought 2 million shares"
2021-05-14 11:43:20,wallstreetbets,"Just trying to understand the AMC logic (have no financial interest one way or the other) 

So after a year of being stuck inside with Netflix, people are finally off covid-19 house arrest and they're all going to... rush to a movie theater to sit down and watch a movie? Do the one thing they could've done for the last year?

(I'd expect the surge in nightclubs, gyms, travel, etc. But I'm not a galaxy brain like most on here so you'll have to excuse my simple ways)"

2021-05-14 16:00:34,wallstreetbets,Bought 3000 shares at 13.20 today. Bought another 500 on the dip at 12.40. What price should I sell at? How long should I hold.  New to this so be kind.
2021-05-14 12:52:01,wallstreetbets,"Can anyone explain why the stock is still green despite this news? I've always been bullish about AMC's rebound potential once the pandemic recedes and people are flooded with new movies to go and see, but this is a *massive* stock dilution, I don't see how we're not experiencing total market carnage with this right now O_o"
2021-05-14 12:20:45,wallstreetbets,Just looked and AMC and GME have the same trading pattern.

2021-05-14 16:06:07,wallstreetbets,"Agreed AMC is in a position to only launch up. It is not even a meme stock, just a good investment."
2021-05-14 15:11:43,wallstreetbets,"When a company sells stock it pretty much always means they think it’s overvalued...this isn’t bullish no matter how you look at it. It may go up temporarily on the power of stupidity and ignorance, but that will be short term at best."

2021-05-14 12:07:13,wallstreetbets,Sold my weekly 10.50 calls yesterday at just over 12 when it was stuck there for a while in the morning. Oops.
2021-05-14 13:30:33,wallstreetbets,This isn't dilution holy shit. Dilution is introducing new shares to the market. They already had these shares for years and unloaded them over two weeks aka our recent red week. Now they're done selling off and no new dilution and the stock is running. Idk whats so hard to understand about that.
2021-05-14 15:14:40,wallstreetbets,They did it over the last few months
2021-05-14 16:30:47,wallstreetbets,Soon ape

2021-05-14 15:59:59,wallstreetbets,"They said they were going to sell those shares. There's another 400 or so they said they were not selling. This is all hearsay, so do your own research to confirm."
2021-05-14 18:37:21,wallstreetbets,"They proposed a vote to authorize 500 m shares at their annual meeting but it got pushback from the shareholders so they first promised to not issue them this year. Then they pulled the proposal, postponed their annual meeting and immediately issued the 43 m they already had authorized since before. My guess is that they desperately need cash, wanted to issue 500 m new shares but when they got pushback they figured they could sell the ones they had in store and survive until year end then went on to do a youtube interview to plea with the shareholders to vote yes. When that didn't work they pulled the proposal and postponed the meeting while selling the 43 million while trying to figure out a new proposal that the shareholders would vote yes to. Maybe 300 m with the condition of not issuing before jan 1 2022."

2021-05-14 12:55:27,wallstreetbets,"Streaming, like so many other entertainment media, stopped being a good investment as soon as competition entered the market. It's one of those strange quirky areas in which more competition is actually bad for both business and the consumer, a bit like sports coverage - once people start being asked to buy five or six recurring subscriptions to access the bulk of the content they want, the bubble bursts and piracy returns to the top of peoples' go-to method of obtaining content.

See this all the time in Europe with sporting championships. The Rugby Union Champions' Cup is a good example, when it was restricted to Sky it was insanely popular, once they split it between Sky and BT piracy rates went through the roof because people just weren't willing to shell out for multiple expensive sports packages just to watch one tournament.

For that reason alone I'd see the streaming bubble burst relatively soon. The golden era is well and truly behind us."
2021-05-14 11:06:32,wallstreetbets,"I’m buying 50 more shares, I see you, we see you."

2021-05-14 14:48:02,wallstreetbets,AMC was struggling pre pandemic so I don’t see any rebound potential as the market cap is higher than prepandemic levels at this point
2021-05-14 12:36:37,wallstreetbets,So many people are complaining about not being able to go to theaters
2021-05-14 11:51:25,wallstreetbets,Lots of big movies have been delayed due to covid also- so we could have a couple record years ahead.
2021-05-14 13:06:20,wallstreetbets,"AMC’s financials are irrelevant. The only thing that they could do that matters is dilute and that’s already out of the way. I’m approaching this like I would a useless cr*pto.

AMC IS A STORE OF VALUE"
2021-05-14 12:42:24,wallstreetbets,"Lots of big movies, like the Marvel franchise, have been delayed a year. They're all basically a guaranteed billion dollars and they announced they'll only be released in theaters. So it'll force people to go if they don't want to wait until they're out of theaters."

2021-05-14 16:20:14,wallstreetbets,Look at its pre-covid numbers and sell around there.
2021-05-14 16:35:29,wallstreetbets,Untill it skyrockets past GME
2021-05-14 16:17:59,wallstreetbets,If it was me...I would hold until $250
2021-05-14 13:29:07,wallstreetbets,We were red for an entire week while they sold these off. Now they're done and the stock is running. This is good news and is NOT DILUTION like so many people are saying. They've already diluted. They have 2 billion in equity now. This isn't bad news and I don't understand why everyone is perceiving it as bad.
2021-05-14 13:32:23,wallstreetbets,"No they don't, because if they did... AMC would be worth 90-100 dollars right now."

2021-05-14 13:48:06,wallstreetbets,"People are being bamboozled.. it sucks.. learn from the past few months. The same people who keep saying hold or buy the dip are the  ones who already pulled out and made returns. Most of them on here have said that they already pulled what they initially invested and left over what they are willing to lose which shows the hypocrisy. 

The other worst part is the lies and fake news that people want to go see movies and that reopening the movie theaters is some how going to thrive.. especially when streaming services are so much convenient. Another thing is that concessions and even prices might go up because of inflation..."

2021-05-14 11:44:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's time for a new squeeze, GME is a floater right now."
2021-05-14 15:54:20,wallstreetbets,Lmao this is blatantly wrong.
2021-05-14 13:35:16,wallstreetbets,Why’s AMC stock going down?!
2021-05-14 16:58:29,wallstreetbets,"AMC puts printin every time, they already are"
2021-05-14 18:34:42,wallstreetbets,Nah diamond hands on this one I bought more.
2021-05-14 16:02:34,wallstreetbets,Hearsay? Didn’t he do an AMA? I’m not sure I need to do DD on it.
2021-05-14 19:16:36,wallstreetbets,"Thank you Sofsjo for the clarification. Do they have plans to do anything with those funds? Or is it to live today die tomorrow situation? I’ve always liked AMC and believed in their business, however, COVID really put a wrench in that. I know they’ve raised funds in the past and did nothing with it except pay the bills."
2021-05-14 16:01:56,wallstreetbets,Just you two.
2021-05-14 15:19:23,wallstreetbets,Not selling less that $300😂😂
2021-05-14 16:11:09,wallstreetbets,If AMC did theater streaming pre release I am in. They could even do a monthly sub and send popcorn and snacks.
2021-05-14 10:44:06,wallstreetbets,"They are sucking money from us investors , their cause is to open all their theaters and sell tickets , he did this in January to us too , he is just like those blood sucker day traders"
2021-05-14 18:04:56,wallstreetbets,Yep.  Still a risk for bankruptcy if they don't start putting out new movies also. Hopefully they make it.
2021-05-14 13:31:00,wallstreetbets,"Yea, i had no idea that was such a big thing for some people 😅

I, personally, am not the biggest fan of spending $20 for popcorn but hey, what do i know? My portfolio is 100% GME so i might be a retard 🤷"
2021-05-14 12:39:47,wallstreetbets,"AMC can't pay their debt even with pre-covid revenue, without some drastic massive change to their business model 2-3 big movies aren't going to save them."
2021-05-14 12:23:07,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha, that's fair. I wouldn't mind seeing Bond in theater. Probably Fast and the Furious 9 too."
2021-05-14 14:14:16,wallstreetbets,Exactly. My play is a bit different. The fact amc is a loser is good because it draws in the short sellers. It’s my bait so I can come around it eat them up.
2021-05-14 16:02:07,wallstreetbets,Only released in theaters and thepiratebay.
2021-05-14 19:44:30,wallstreetbets,So... Around 14.00
2021-05-14 16:13:28,wallstreetbets,Means low buys for us and higher returns. Let the doubters jump on our train after it's picked up momentum.
2021-05-14 17:17:25,wallstreetbets,why?
2021-05-14 15:54:21,wallstreetbets,"Seriously. After being given the option to stream movies online same day as theaters I don't see why anybody wirh a decent TV would bother going to the movies. Even occasionally. 

AMC is not gonna get much higher that this. I bought at around $14 and plan to just break even now that it's high again. It took three months to get this high, I'm certain their peak has hit. 

Theaters are done."
2021-05-14 18:15:40,wallstreetbets,I'm at 15.31 avg px :')
2021-05-14 12:15:47,wallstreetbets,"what strike?  I bought 10 in december with a $3.50 strike and 1/21/22 expiration and just no idea how long I should hold.

Could have sold them for $2k/each when it was $17/share in late Jan lol."
2021-05-14 13:33:04,wallstreetbets,Same... 6/4 expiry... I want the tendies yesterday tho.

2021-05-14 13:21:53,wallstreetbets,"Yes it was.

It was absolutely the dumbest move lol"
2021-05-14 16:43:40,wallstreetbets,Nope. At some point you have to take responsibility for buying overpriced equities fueled by speculation.

2021-05-14 16:55:07,wallstreetbets,"Well I didn’t read the AMA, I’m just telling you what I heard from others."
2021-05-14 16:16:32,wallstreetbets,AMC would never do this. They would have to invest millions in a streaming platform AND still pay for the content. This would be a noop. This is why so many streaming platforms make their own content. It's a race to the bottom now.
2021-05-14 11:00:47,wallstreetbets,"You’re delusional. It is not the job of AMC to make a bunch of teenagers on the internet money off gambling stocks. Of course they want to open theaters and sell tickets, what the hell do you think their business model is?"
2021-05-14 14:38:18,wallstreetbets,"I do not miss the theaters at all. But lots of family and friends have expressed great anticipation for movie theaters reopening. To each their own, I’m not knocking them"
2021-05-14 13:39:57,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I'm Italian and used to joke about popcorn's price a lot. Thanks God after first covid wave (I mean, last summer where cinemas here were basically open) they dropped prices a lot. 10€ for popcorns+ticket sounds legit to me, it's not that bad of a deal. They're good af and I love cinemas!  
I don't care about AMC tho, I don't even know what it is tbh."
2021-05-14 12:43:03,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree, that’s why I sold at $12.50 and was happy.  Same day release on HBO Max is what I hope the future holds.  Just saying I can understand the bullish case.  Big movies plus smaller chains that did go under will provide enough revenue the next couple years to keep the doors open.  But long term the home watching experience has improved in a huge way and theaters aren’t needed.  (Same as the death of arcades when home consoles could do the same things)"
2021-05-14 16:16:05,wallstreetbets,"So who will take their place? With supply and demand, AMC will rebound until there is better market competition. Remember AMC hurt due to the pandemic, and so did everyone else. All other competitions are hurting even worse."
2021-05-14 14:24:25,wallstreetbets,"exactly, none of this has anything to do with anything but supply and demand for the stock itself. Any talk of amc as anything but a ticker is fud."

AMC owns Odeon, which you've probably heard of."
2021-05-14 13:46:51,wallstreetbets,"😂 yea, plus AMC had 5x their normal trading volume yesterday (compared to the last 1-2 months) and only moved up a couple dollars and today they are on pace for probably around 3x their normal trading volume 🤷

Meanwhile GME had only 1.5x their normal trading volume yesterday (compared to the last 1-2 months) and it went up like $20 bucks and today it's on pace to go back down to it's usual low volume again while still maintaining the majority of it's price increase 😅"
2021-05-14 12:52:49,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, there may be an initial surge when everything eventually normalizes and people can go out again but ultimately covid has opened the door for new opportunities that it turns out people really fucking like...like watching a movie opening day from the comfort of your home via streaming service.

Me personally I only ever watched movies in the theatre that were really meant for a theatre experience like IMAX, without some other unique ""pull"" it's going to be nearly impossible for AMC to massively increase their revenue above pre-covid before the timer expires on their debt."
2021-05-14 14:01:43,wallstreetbets,"And if I watch a movie, it is with my wife and we are in one of the luxury theaters where they serve you booze and decent food (not bar food)

Did someone fill Blockbuster's place when they scoffed at Netflix's proposal and went bankrupt? Nope.

What's filling the void is streaming services and direct-to-stream releases of movies.

Not everything has to be a zero sum game where if AMC doesn't exist something else *like* AMC **has** to exist. AMC can cease to exist if a better option exists out there that AMC cannot compete with and is disrupted by. Which is exactly what happened with Netflix and Blockbuster."

I don’t like Twitter, I think it’s in trouble when regulation hits, but I won’t short it. 

I think SnapChat is hella overvalued. But I’m not shorting it.

2021-05-14 16:44:47,wallstreetbets,Adam literally said they've had these 43 million shares on hand for years. They were not newly created. You're referring to the 500 million share dilution proxy vote that they took off the table. Next.
2021-05-14 16:42:07,wallstreetbets,That article clearly says that they aren't going to issue the 500 million shares NOT that they don't need shareholder approval. You should reread that.
2021-05-14 16:46:58,wallstreetbets,"Bro lmaoo I'm the one thats blatantly incorrect? Homie this is saying they're not issuing the 500 million shares and took the proxy vote off the table.

Idk, I'm glad there's a big and nice community of AMC and I'm happy for them and I'm glad they do their own researches (which I'd love to hear anyway just for curiosity).  
I'm also 100% into GME since january so yep, it is what it is."

It dilutes."

2021-05-14 16:50:55,wallstreetbets,">AMC filed a shelf registration today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to permit the issuance and sale of up to 43 million shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock from time to time through an ""at-the-market"" equity offering program

You don't know what you're talking about. This filing gave them the option, which they took, to ISSUE and sell 43 million new shares. 

The 500 million share issuance measure allows them the board - WITHOUT VOTING FROM SHAREHOLDERS - to register up to 500M shares whenever they want. It's hilarious to me that this took 3 minutes of searching, but you're so emotionally invested in it."
2021-05-14 16:27:25,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Definitely would have to happen before the industry pushes theaters out. Most likely wouldn't happen.

2021-05-14 19:09:40,wallstreetbets,Good topic of discussion for first stockholders' meeting.
2021-05-14 16:58:30,wallstreetbets,"The 43 million shares were already there. They just sold them. And they do still need the shareholder approval for the 500 million share authorization. 

You either didn't read the article or your reading comprehension is horrible. The latter being more likely as you didn't even understand my orignal comment. I never claim you said they issued the 500 million new shares either."
2021-05-14 16:57:40,wallstreetbets,Okay buddy boyo you have a great day. Ill be sure to personally send you my gains when this is said and done.

2021-05-14 12:27:01,wallstreetbets,you need to understand what calls are they are different from shares. Shares you can hold forever or until the company goes bankrupt. Calls are essentially a gamble where you say I will pay you 500 dollars to buy 100 shares at 10 dollars before a certain date. Now if the shares go over 15 dollars you are making a profit since you can pay 1000 dollars and get 100 shares with a value of over 1500$. The problem is if the share price does not reach those 15 dollars or much worse if it does not reach 10$ by the set date then your contract is worthless since you could buy 100 shares for less then 1000$. That is what happened to the person you initially responded to his contract gamble did not pay off so the value went to zero. The numbers here are made up a contract like that would probably not be that expensive so you would start making a profit soon after 10$ probably
2021-05-14 10:35:36,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it is a good start , sellers hurt us , buyers help us get closer to the squeeze"

2021-05-14 17:04:04,wallstreetbets,">The 43 million shares were already there.

No. They weren't. That doesn't even make any sense. The FILING was ""already there"", which gave them the option to issue and sell the shares when they pleased. What do you think ""Issue"" means in the filing? Here, I'll help you.

2021-05-14 09:58:48,wallstreetbets,I’ll buy them next week. I have all my money in positions I don’t want to sell yet.

2021-05-14 19:52:32,wallstreetbets,What’s a math
2021-05-14 19:33:41,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC , this seems huge. Position in 2nd slide , LFG!!! "
2021-05-14 11:00:15,wallstreetbets,"Fee is up to 77.4% now!

EDIT: 95.9% as of 12:15!!!"
2021-05-14 13:32:27,wallstreetbets,"Options contracts expiring next Friday represent nearly [half of the entire available float](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naxmxw/from_ashes_to_the_moon_and_then_back_to_ashes_in/), and 90% of the volume of those contracts is unhedged, meaning this thing is a powder keg waiting to blow.

There are 83.72m shares in the float. That's small. In fact, something like 94% of the company is owned by the CEO, with those 83.72m representing the other 6%. Insiders own 12.85% of that float and institutions own 24.50%, which together is 37.35%. For those of you who never graduated from elementary school, that's 31.27m shares, which makes the free float 51.45 million shares.

Of that, 11.88m shares are short (as of 04/29) which is 23% of the free float. That's important, but not in and of itself enough to squeeze. (Addendum: It is certainly higher now than it was on 04/29, because as of TODAY there are zero shares available to short).

Options volume for 05/21 is huge - between the $7.5 and $15 strikes, there are approx. 205,500 calls, all out of the money. Their average delta is about 10% (according to Schwab), meaning that as they become ITM, 18.5m shares will be automatically bought by brokers to cover those calls. This is a gamma ramp - it will happen linearly if the stock ticks upwards, creating a positive feedback loop of rising price until they are entirely hedged. At the same time, shorts must cover if the price rises (or must they?). That means that IF the price rises significantly, nearly 30 million shares must be bought in the next 7 days to cover - that's 57% of all the shares available!

Holy fuck.

Also on Wednesday the stock experienced an extremely sudden 10% surge (when everything else was in a multi-day freefall) and it hasn't gone back down."
2021-05-14 10:03:13,wallstreetbets,Yup!  Premium is about to go through the roof.  Nothing left to borrow lol and Ish is buying shares.  #$%@ the shorts lol.  This sucker is going up.  Cheers.

2021-05-14 11:14:59,wallstreetbets,Not sure if you’re replying to me but a higher borrow fee means shorts have more of an incentive to cover because it costs them more money to hold.
2021-05-14 14:53:53,wallstreetbets,It means there is no one willing to buy your calls if you were to sell them (either to open or to close). A broker will always be willing to write you a new call though - and at $5 that is extremely cheap. It also means there is no longer any reason for anyone to buy calls above that strike. The open interest is the number of calls already written.

2021-05-14 15:52:23,wallstreetbets,"This is the best DD I’ve seen on the stock that is recent 

This DD is NOT my own, but was removed for troublesome language. I read through the DD and understand why the OP had their post pulled down. That being said, the content is solid and I think its worth repeating. I have edited the below DD to remove the parts that were maybe a little too over-eager.

$UWMC ULTIMATE DD

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC. The massive 5.75% dividend. Their insanely LOW P/E of about 3.9 and their insane income growth. 4,200% increase in net income! 🚀 (No that’s not a typo)

So why would any one want to buy this stock right now ?

The CEO is a beast. And not only did they reaffirm their dividend (ex date in June) and just make $860M in the first quarter, they announced the approval of a $300M stock buy back. That’s big money ! But let’s dive deeper. The $300M share buy back is of the class A shares that are in the float. $UWMC has a very small float.

104M shares. $300M / $6.70 = 45M. That means at current prices they can buy back nearly 44% of the entire F\*\*kin float. You have never heard of that before and you probably never will again. On earnings call yesterday CEO says “We can start buying shares tomorrow and I am a buyer at this price !”

So that leaves 60M shares left in the float. Institutions own 23M of them (I bet it’s higher) short interest is close to 13M based on latest data.

This just caused the borrow rate to increase by 5X ! new data shows short borrow rates just hit 25%

Apes, there are less than 35M shares freely traded in this stock right now.

On top of all this we still have Russell Inclusion to be announced in June and another blow out 2Q is in the works.

This is NOT financial advice but I can't think of a reason I shouldn’t park a few dollars in a highly profitable stock, trading at all time lows, paying a 6% dividend with a current p/e under 4?

My position 7900 shares @ 7.64 and 45x 6/18 8c

TL,DR 🏘=💵💵💵💵 = UWMC 🚀🚀🚀🤑  


Edit: since I posted there are only 2,000 shares to loan and the borrow rate is 35%!!?!??


can't stop the work."
2021-05-14 11:23:45,wallstreetbets,"No idea tbh. By comparison AMC’s borrow fee ramped up from 26.6% on Monday to 90.1% on Wednesday and then tapered off a bit to 84.3% end of day, after that it squeezed yesterday and it’s still running."
2021-05-14 13:07:46,wallstreetbets,"Something, can't you read?"
2021-05-14 14:34:56,wallstreetbets,Means everyone is waiting.  No one is selling.  They only do enough to push it down under the 7.5 strike
2021-05-14 13:29:02,wallstreetbets,Additional context $RKT is at .8% to borrow right now. So in the same space this is 100x more expensive to borrow right now
2021-05-14 13:22:29,wallstreetbets,This level does not happen often. But I believe AMC went this high to start the week and you see what’s happening there. I’m not predicting anything other than it’s really expensive to short right now
2021-05-14 09:55:25,wallstreetbets,They were in the money for a bit. Lol thank you
2021-05-14 16:25:05,wallstreetbets,there was news that triggered the AMC movement. not the borrow fees.

2021-05-14 15:11:45,wallstreetbets,Thank you 🤙
2021-05-14 13:43:28,wallstreetbets,"So does this mean people who have already shorted are now paying the increased fee or is it only applicable to new shorts? 

Also, why on earth would anyone be selling if the stars seem to be aligning for a squeeze? Once something like this happens, wouldn't it be more sensible to pile in and force the shorts to cover?"
2021-05-14 16:27:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I agree it wasn’t the sole reason, but if they had a low borrow fee I think the catalyst wouldn’t have had such a big effect."
2021-05-14 14:08:46,wallstreetbets,Oh...let me tell you what he said...waaait a minute!
2021-05-14 13:47:10,wallstreetbets,They need to try to keep it under $7.50. If that gives that means the chain of ITM calls opens up. They need to calculate if they lose more on short interest or having to cover all the contracts
2021-05-14 13:50:45,wallstreetbets,Ah ok. So if there are no more shares to short how are they keeping the price down? It seems odd to me that they'd be holding shares and shorting.
2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CNBC's Jim Cramer Is So Full of Shit... Don't ask me why but I often watch Mad Money on CNBC. I also make note of where I got recommendations when I buy stocks, and I'm starting to realize how bad his recommendations often are and how dishonest he is about his bad calls. A few examples:

&#x200B;

1) Last night, someone called into to ask about Aeva and he said he couldn't recommend it. Oh really? Actually, HE DID recommend it just several weeks ago. I know because I bought it soon afterwards and it tanked. I understand things change and he's entitled to change his mind but how about at least saying something like, ""I know I recommended this one before, but I can't now because of inflation or whatever...""

2) XL Fleet. Same story as above. He recommended it, then he didn't and pretended like the earlier recommendation never happened.

3) Tech meltdown. In the runup to the 2020 election, Big Jim was pimping hard for Biden. Okay, fine, everyone's entitled to their opinion. But he kept repeatedly claiming that Biden would great for tech stocks, especially Apple, because he would improve relations with China. This call has been catastrophically wrong, at least so far but no acknowledgment of this whatsoever from him. As a so -called expert, shouldn't he have known that the policies Biden was calling for (huge increase in government spending, massive stimulus checks, enhanced unemployement checks, etc, etc) would cause inflation and inflation would be bad for many of these high multiple tech stocks? 

&#x200B;

Yeah, I know. I shouldn't be taking recommendations from Cramer and other so-called TV experts. That's on me...but I just wanted to add my thoughts here in case others take him seriously. And yes, I'm sure some of his recommendations also pan out well but I wish he would man up and admit when he makes bad calls."
2021-05-14 09:39:33,wallstreetbets,Just do the opposite of what he says
2021-05-14 10:20:20,wallstreetbets,"Keep in mind that Jim Cramer, like all other media and most SoMe influencers, are not talking because they have something to say, but becouse someone is listening. And they need to keep talking at all cost to retain their position."

Cramer this week: Retail stocks are the new gold rush! Buy! Buy! Buy! You have to get in before it is to late!

Cramer the very next week after retail stocks tank: Big money managers are selling off retail stocks as fast as they can. You should have gotten out while you had the chance.

My opinion. Only use tv, social media, friends, whatsapp groups, discord etc to **find** stocks. To hear about it etc. Then do some research.

I'm not saying you always have to do fundamental analysis etc just make sure you at least check the sentiment about the stock in multiple places and over time. Check it with your own future plans and strategies. If you can, do not buy it right away. If it's really time sensitive (9/10 its not) you can alwas buy or sell half of what you where thinking.

Get emotion out of investing. You make money **before** you buy the stock, you stay relaxed because you did research **before** you bought. If it doesn't feel right you have too much stake in the game.

To end, JIm is full of shit and he is **not** being payed to make you money. He is being payed to make television and maybe even to make other people rich."

edit: to put a finer fucking point on this stupid shit... those same doomsayers are just predicting something that literally none of the data backs up in any way. even the most recent data doesn’t point to inflation at all. it’s literally lack of essential workers (because many died during the essential part of the pandemic) and supply chains breaking due to a massive increase in demand.

a couple trillion dollars isn’t going to cause any real increase in inflation especially since most of it is being spent in a very diverse array of ways. this is the same logic as “oh man, mcdonald’s CANT increase their min. wage to $15 because burgers would cost $5 more”. that’s so fucking stupid and wrong that whoever says that should be immediately thrown into the nether realm."
2021-05-14 10:01:26,wallstreetbets,"If you sit there and admit that you’re wrong, then you are going to be losing your own clout. While it may make him a more honorable man to admit mistake, it doesn’t make him more reliable - quite the opposite. 

It’s entertainment television, not legitimate financial advice. The problem is that it’s marketed as financial advice and not entertainment television"
2021-05-14 09:57:00,wallstreetbets,"You’re asking Cramer to be a bit too apologetic in my opinion. Everything he has to say about the market is simply speculation, just like anyone else. To apologize for not being right about the market is silly given how often any analyst is wrong about any particular play. The line from wolf of Wall Street, “No one fucking knows”."
2021-05-14 14:45:52,wallstreetbets,"I actually went back and read your whole post.... I see what you did there! 

But honestly as someone who has listened to him nearly daily for at least 14-15 years... the best way to think about him is as a high school teacher. He opens every show saying he wants to teach you. The first segment of the show is a rundown of what happened in the market that day and why it happened. This information is priceless. I recommend people who do not have time to watch his show at least try and catch that first segment. Just to get the temperature of the market. The CEO interviews are priceless. I take this opportunity to try and judge if the CEO is full of shit or not. The other segments are usually caller interactions, and I usually just listen here for thoughts on things I already own. 

He tells you to do the homework, and often teaches you how to do the homework. I have many times seen him own up to calls that went wrong. To say that he does not do this shows that you do not listen to his show everyday or in full. 

The Bear Sterns controversy was complete and utter bullshit. As someone who was a fan of Jon Stewart, I lost a ton of respect for him on that poorly cut interview. People have to look at context. If you followed this whole thing, then you cannot honestly say that Cramer was wrong on that. If people had listened to Cramer during that time, they would have saved and made a whole lot of money. Cramer called the bottom of that recession, though he gave full credit to Mark Haines. 

Look I get it... nobody wants to do the work. People tune in to Cramer looking for a hot stock tip, then lose their shit when they take a dive in and right after you establish that full position, the stock craters 20% and you panic out. Been there done that. Once I looked in the mirror and realized that I did not follow any of the advice he had given, I placed the blame on myself where it belonged. 

When I started listening... my portfolio expanded. Massively. 

Thanks Cramer!"

I also can't agree with your description of why we have 'inflation'.   It might pan out to be true, but at the moment it seems to be driven by simply shortages and high demand."

He takes into consideration the sector, price (chart), latest earnings news and sentiment all in 20-25 seconds.  But if you listen to him in the am or when interviewing CEO’s he’s done more DD and has more insight before speaking.  Cramer is probably the most intelligent person on TV when seriously discussing stocks/cos.


He takes heat because he’s willing to give opinions and is accessible, tell me 1 other person who gives his!! Not his firms opinion and he takes crap for saying buy today and sell 7 days later BUT it’s when facts change or new info is available all others give an opinion and do not change that opinion and that will cost you more $$$ than selling (or buying back) 7 days later"

ASPN (Aspen Aerogels): not sure but way down since I bought it

NCNO (NCino): down 29% this month

AFRM (Affirm)): down 27% this month

SNOW: way the fuck down since he recommened it

TTD (Trade Desk): down 31% this month

PLUG: way the hell down

Now I know a lot of these are the same types of stocks but from Around November-February, probably 75% of the stocks the guy plugged were ""Woodstocks.""

My 3-year old daughter and I watch Undisputed with Skip and Shannon every morning having cereal and, as long as you remember to never take any shit they say even remotely seriously, it's a lot of fun.

There are ethical questions for sure when a performance artist isn't just coming up with takes to defend America's team but is actually recommending you spend your money, but that's another topic."
2021-05-14 12:57:47,wallstreetbets,Cramer does have occasionally some good ideas but his timing is usually bad. For example i bought T at 28.50. He said many times do not buy it. At 32 he got behind the stock. If he recommends a stock you really dig try to wait for a pullback before pulling the trigger.

But when it comes to actually picking good tickers and trading well? He's nearly always behind. He'll tell you to buy a stock that rallied massively because it's hot as hell when in reality it's likely ready for a huge correction. And that small cap that's ready for a massive rally? He wouldn't recommend it because it hasn't run yet. Once it runs he'll recommend it and then at that point it's just about ready to dump or pull back substantially.

2021-05-14 14:35:14,wallstreetbets,"On your third point, there are a good number of economists that believe the increase in inflation is due to the pandemic receding and supply chains/production re-aligning.  In other words, the expectation is that the bump in inflation last month is tied more to the effects of the pandemic on production and supply chain versus any specific policies being pushed by Biden.

(It should also be noted that stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment have been in play for over a year now, so  the idea that this is due to anything specific to Biden is somewhat absurd. Likewise for increase in government spending: it's questionable whether any meaningful increase in spending will occur, with Republicans outright rejecting such increases and Manchin rejected things like eliminating the filibuster. So the scenario I outlined above, as stated by a number of economists, is much more likely)."
2021-05-14 14:37:13,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is the Bill Maher of the stock market.  So completely out of touch.  I still don't know how he has a job after the Bear Stearns fiasco.
2021-05-14 14:40:00,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is the best.  When he says juke I jive.
2021-05-14 14:40:19,wallstreetbets,But why did you buy Aeva and not GME and AMC. Are you a retard?

Buy his recommendation.

Unlike most of Reddit, I believe his heart is in the right place, and it’s not his fault he can’t predict the market - no one can. I wouldn’t advise anyone to buy or sell anything solely because Jim said so, but if you did just take it as a lesson and move on. Borrowed conviction rarely works."

2021-05-14 16:14:16,wallstreetbets,He's just a tv entertainer now.
2021-05-14 16:14:34,wallstreetbets,Why not make a WSB investment advice show and train an ape to throw poo at the next meme stock while we wave out tendies in the air?
2021-05-14 16:23:17,wallstreetbets,Remember when he said to buy Lehman brothers two weeks before they went bankrupt.  Lol Cramer is clown actually I do the opposite of what he says and do very well.

2021-05-14 16:37:52,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain why Cramer has any investing credibility or what he actually accomplished as an investor?
2021-05-14 16:38:58,wallstreetbets,"Funny story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen.  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show - it may have been ""Mad Money"" or similar.  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most amazing woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don’t know – why would I know?”, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous – it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn’t even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim’s continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  You could cut the tension with a knife – and this was over the radio.  Anyway, after my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle – I don’t think that I was ever more embarrassed for another person as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim’s enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don’t blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show."
2021-05-14 16:39:17,wallstreetbets,"Who the *fuck* is Cramer, and why haven't you ordered yet?

Because sir. SIR. This is a *Wendy's*

P.S. fuck Cramer."
2021-05-14 16:39:27,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer has been full of shit since he started talking
2021-05-14 16:41:02,wallstreetbets,I made a lot of money off of Zoom and Crowdstrike listening to Cramer last year.  I've also made a lot of money on GME reading wallstreetbets.  Listen and read the information as presented and do your own research on it before investing in something.
2021-05-14 16:41:05,wallstreetbets,Why do people even praise him.
2021-05-14 16:50:35,wallstreetbets,"You understand that anything you see or hear on tv, including news, should just be seen as entertainment right? Especially a business network that wants to trick you into thinking they are on your side and want to help you make good decisions for your financial future. If you actually look at CNBC financial shows and think its going to be useful to you, you are sorely mistaken."
2021-05-14 16:55:28,wallstreetbets,"It sucks you listened to him, but I also feel like that's ones of the only ways someone would be able to list examples like you did: when you get screwed by it.  The other would be if you hate him and just want to flame for his level of selling out"
2021-05-14 17:01:13,wallstreetbets,Lol anyone saying Biden would be better for corporations than trump should just be ignored
2021-05-14 17:03:06,wallstreetbets,"I haven’t had much luck with stocks I was introduced to on his show and that he did dd on supposedly and positioned in a positive light... for example BMBL, ABNB, AFRM, and TPGY... he rarely admits he’s wrong and he takes credit when he’s right. He also recommends so many stocks it’s impossible that he did dd on them all... he seems to be influenced by what his audience wants to hear and tends to be positive about almost any company willing to come on his show... if it’s a good (maybe better stock) than a competitor he likes or a company that wouldn’t come on his show he automatically dislikes it... he also reverses frequently... so ive learned to take his recommendations with a grain of salt and basically watch the intro for his more market environment education related stuff and because he moves markets or at least certain stocks sometimes... usually by the time he’s said something it’s already been hyped at that moment to it’s highest intra-day or after hours point and i would have made more money shorting it

Also if it’s popular on social media or with Cathy wood he automatically hates it"
2021-05-14 17:04:13,wallstreetbets,"No shit. Earlier this week when PTON crapped the bed and went to $84 he got on his soap box and ranted to not buy the dip.

2021-05-14 17:06:04,wallstreetbets,"If Jim Cramer thought Biden would improve relations with China, he has no understanding of geopolitics.  Biden will stabilize relations with China, and over the long term it's possible that they could improve, but there was never for a second going to be an instant turn around on China relations.

That said, without actually hearing the context of what he said, the tech situation sounds like a long term play.  Policies take a while to implement, and then conditions take a while to adjust.  Improving the US domestic tech sector will take months to years, not days to weeks."
2021-05-14 17:06:04,wallstreetbets,Your first problem was listening to Jim Cramer

*stimulus checks, enhanced unemployement checks, etc, etc) would cause*   
*inflation and inflation would be bad for many of these high multiple*   
*tech stocks?*

Why is this shit even allowed on here? People in the stock market for longer than a year or two know that the President doesn't really affect things that much. Trump just took all the credit for a hot market because that's what he does. Even more importantly, this is how hypocritical and unaware of reality you are:

*Just last week, Trump tweeted, “The Federal Reserve is derelict in its*   
*duties if it doesn’t lower the Rate and even, ideally, stimulate.”*

That was **before the pandemic. Stimulus and rate cuts.** If that happened, the pandemic would have set us into negative interest rates and we'd be fucked hard, although you would still sit there and blame Biden.

Why is this bullshit allowed?"
2021-05-14 18:15:18,wallstreetbets,"I bought Inseego two months ago at 10. One of my biggest losses. And Cramer recommended this stock 6 months ago at 20. Last year he said he is strictly against oil stocks and they were among the best performers in 2021, luckily I bought a lot of them. He was also against airline stocks one year ago and then they tripled in one month. And I once read that back in the day when he was a fund manager his performance was rather poor. I really don't understand why CNBC hasn't fired him."

Sure, Biden was tagged as a guy giving cabinet positions to these big tech wigs and pegged as not being as progressive as people originally thought but that is just Dem deep state stuff. Of course they are listening to big tech and wall st and not really giving two shits about retail but you should be left to your own devices which is realizing inflation was coming and that the stimmy is just kicking can down road (implicit tax) and thinking for yourself.

It’s amazing this has never gained more traction and gone viral costing him his position with NBC; then again, he’s obviously a plant, and him and his cronies get together to strategize the best way to leverage his reach with the public, so to some degree he’s probably protected anyway.

My grandparents have done well in the market, mind, they never actively traded, it’s all from a lifetime of investing and holding, but, I know a lot of elderly people do watch Cramer, my grandmother included, and think he’s tits, little knowing that juicy exposés like this are out here on the internetz.

2021-05-14 10:14:11,wallstreetbets,"This is by far the worst of it, the damage that one recommendation made is probably still being felt by some people today."
2021-05-14 10:55:46,wallstreetbets,Water is actually not wet. It only makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the ability of a liquid to adhere to the surface of a solid. So if you say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the surface of the object.
2021-05-14 15:49:57,wallstreetbets,"you can't chalk the whole thing up to supply chain. so many big employers all around the country are raising their minimum to $15 per hour, puts pressure on all of them to do so. and you can't discount the impact of sending out billions of dollars worth of stimulus."
2021-05-14 10:01:11,wallstreetbets,I'm not saying the guy owes anyone an apology. I'm saying be a man and admit when you previously recommended a stock and then changed your mind. Don't just tell us one day we have to buy a stock and then later on act like anyone who bought it is a damn fool.

In fact, I think most recommendations on reddit are moronic, because they keep recommending over valued, premium priced stocks that have nowhere else to go, but down after they lose popularity.

Every one is panicking about the ""sToRm"" and my stocks are increasing in value while everything else tanks. If they actually decrease to the target, Ill start dumping more money in for the higher consistent dividend yield. Its like there is no way to lose. Problem is, I held for so long that most of the stocks that were invested have to lose 50% before I break even."
2021-05-14 11:56:48,wallstreetbets,Solid DD on wetness.
2021-05-14 17:05:06,wallstreetbets,"yes, i can discount that, incidentally. if that were the case we would have seen the same thing in the aftermath of the 2008 world banking crisis. we didn’t because it just went back to the equilibrium it was at previously.

a crisis, and the spending thereafter, doesn’t seem to impact inflation rates all that much. in fact, ours was still very low until literally april. an extra $2 trillion did NOT cause that. if that were the case, the $6+ trillion in fed asset buying would have seen SOMETHING, but there’s no evidence of it.

raising minimum wages has minimal effect. the reason  prices typically rise so much is because of capitalism, not wage increase. especially with major, national and multi-national companies.

and to wrap it up, supply chain issues are the mains river behind skyrocketing prices. do you really think lumber has risen 120%+ because of INFLATION? or that home prices, gasoline, and meat prices have risen because of INFLATION? oh man, come on. you have to do some basic research here."
2021-05-14 10:05:35,wallstreetbets,I guess you’re right. I’m not really bothered by his behavior. I watch the show to get an overview on what’s happening in the market. I don’t really listen to his picks.

> Ancient, powerful creatures whose origins lie in the distant past of the cosmos, no two Great Old Ones are exactly alike, although they tend to share similar traits. Most are colossal monstrosities formed from the very fabric of the universe and virtually impossible to destroy, have minds whose thought processes are incomprehensible to humans, show little to no regard for the consequences their actions may have on lesser beings, and drive to insanity any who look upon their true form. In addition, the majority of them are able to influence the minds of sentient creatures even when sleeping or dormant. Initially believed to have been merely indifferent to the fates of those unfortunate enough to be around them, recent writings have shown the majority of them to be actively hostile to the mortal population of the cosmos.

We traders are the foolish mortal cultists who attempt to harness the power of the Great Old Ones for our own benefit. We cast spells (i.e., trade stocks) in hope of getting rich. We study arcane rituals and crazy nonsense in hopes of finding the key to power (i.e., DD). Sometimes it works, but usually it destroys us. Even when it works, we're driven insane by the sheer incomprehensibility of our alien masters."

2021-05-14 13:16:36,wallstreetbets,Right now it is null until under 410 IMO. This is the line in the sand from a TA perspective IMO. It was def more plausible when we were at 405 range since that was at the bottom support line of mid-term trend - if it would have broke 400 ish I think 380 was a PT on one of my posts. 417 is a test and then I think we see an ATH IMO but lets see.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why are red days redder for Redditors? An analytical perspective! We have all seen it. SPY drops 2% and then there is a barrage of posts and comments about how it’s due to manipulation/next recession/long-overdue correction etc. I wanted to understand what causes such extreme reactions over small drops in SPY. There might be multiple reasons as mentioned in other posts such as inexperienced investors/lesser time in the market/volatile portfolio. While the first two cannot be proven analytically, we can definitely verify the volatile portfolio concept.

For this, first, we have to understand Beta. Put simply, Beta is the measure of the volatility of a stock in relation to the overall market. If we consider SPY as the benchmark, Beta of SPY would be 1. A high-risk tech company with a Beta of 1.75 would be more volatile than the market. I.e., if SPY returns 10% in one week, the company is expected to return 17.5% (75% more than SPY). But, this works both ways. If SPY drops 10%, the stock will drop 17.5%. Herein lies the problem.

Here is the list of most discussed stocks last month, along with their Beta values.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/dr0pfv2j03z61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aa1e53e426ef4cdd8a9b173e95776df015a83cb)

As you can see, almost all of the popular stocks in social media have extreme volatility. For e.g., PLTR has a Beta of 9.6! This means that the stock will drop a whopping 9.6% for every 1% drop in the market.

For analysis purposes, I am creating an equally distributed portfolio of these 9 stocks (Coinbase is not considered as it has not been trading long enough to calculate Beta). **The average Beta of this portfolio is 3.14!**

This implies that if SPY drops a mere 3% your portfolio would be down 9.3%. This value would be even higher in case you have a portfolio that is skewed towards CLOV or PLTR. What’s ironic here is that GME with its negative Beta can act as a hedge against red days!

**Limitations of the analysis:** One of the major assumptions with the analysis is that people who talk about stocks probably own that stock which might not be the case. Also, this analysis might not hold for future patterns since Beta accounts only for historical data and cannot predict where the market will go. Finally, the data is taken from nasdaq.com (as of 2nd May) and they haven’t exactly disclosed the time period or the benchmark they use for Beta calculation.

**Conclusion:**

As we can prove from the analysis, we significantly underestimate the overall risk we are taking by adding popular stocks to our portfolio. The phenomenal gains we see on good days can easily be taken away on red days which explains the overreaction. In other words,

*“what Beta giveth, Beta taketh away!”*"

Sup, honorable apecitizens! Recently I’ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

(Not a financial advice, as I am not a professional advisor, just an amateur ANALyzer)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

— A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

# Tesla, or how Elon Mask truly “is become meme, Destroyer of shorts”: Apr 2019 - Apr 2020

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ☝️ is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see.

**TL;DR** is in the comments.

If it goes to ZERO and Citadel was short all of the shares (only 25% short now) you know what Ken Griffin would make? $2.5 billion. Citadel manages over $300 billion I believe He’s worth $30 billion and Citadel makes $6 billion a year. GME is worth $11 billion. He’s going to risk it all when GME goes to infinity and fight a successful social media mob?   Something tells me he’s smarter than that.

Only a small resistance to his rule still remains. A handful of former hedge fund owners leading a shorting resistance from the shadows.

2021-05-14 10:25:56,wallstreetbets,"Yes the charts and technicals may add up but sentiment and fundamentals also provided the necessary fuel to the rocket for VW and TSLA to moon. 
VW literally 75% of float disappeared in a few weeks with the shareholder publicly stating they would not sell. 
TSLA turned a profit and all the environmental legislation fucking guarantees they will continue to have growing demand. Oh and literally like every other auto maker is a potential customer for batteries. 
GME was illegally shorted into oblivion, and was actually suffering from a business stand point. Now they have started to turn it around but there is more uncertainty around gme then tsla. Isk how people can compare gme to vw cuz the situations are just so different.

Idk man more power to you but like this is such unique situation with so many external factors ( and as we saw in jan a shit load of risk ) that its hard to determine if there will be another run up at all. I would love to see GME break 1k, who wouldnt( hehe oh kenny ) its just crazy how pervasive this single stonk has become"

2021-05-14 12:03:33,wallstreetbets,Losing short positions have potential for INFINITE LOSSES. That doesnt change because of what happened in TSLA or VW. $2200 wouldn’t do shit for me im holding till im filthy fuckin rich or bust. 🚀🦍💎

2021-05-14 12:07:40,wallstreetbets,So realistically what should be my sell point. I really do hope it hits 10-20k and I know some stocks are even higher than that but 2k sounds alot more believable. But I'll be kicking my self if I miss out on hundreds of thousands of dollars.
2021-05-14 12:09:12,wallstreetbets,i don't think any one has really sold their positions in GME.  everyone is waiting for earnings report on **6/8/2021** to see if the hedge funds try to pull the same bulls@$t that they did on the first earnings.  I was pissed that i missed that one.

25% of shares of GME are short. That’s $2.7 billion. Yet the hedge fund industry which manages $2 trillion and makes most of its money being long is going to put all of their assets on the line (if it moons to infinity that is the argument)  to get that $2 billion in profit (less than 1/10th of 1% of assets). They know WSB hates them but let’s take a step back and see how this makes sense from a hedge fund perspective. ."

2021-05-14 12:29:12,wallstreetbets,"Most relevant VW comparison: the VW short interest was so far beyond 100% that the squeeze could have lasted much longer.  The longs could have named their price and the shorts would have had to pay it. Porsche settled their options early because they were trying to do a hostile takeover of VW, so they needed the squeeze to end so they could buy even more.  If it had been millions of retail apes that were long rather than 1 big competitor, the VW squeeze would have played out for much longer, and gone much higher.  Now imagine if the **bare minimum** short interest was 200% and you start to get a picture of GME."
2021-05-14 14:28:00,wallstreetbets,">	It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out.

If this is true for GME, then what is the worst case outcome for the short sellers? What does the burning building actually look like? Are they going to lose money on a bad trade, or are they going to jail?"
2021-05-14 14:37:06,wallstreetbets,No. The VW squeeze was stopped by Porsche selling off. This time shorts won't be spared

2021-05-14 18:34:38,wallstreetbets,"What info do you have that supports that it already happened, besides a jump in price?  

His TA shows the info that supports that fact that both VW and TSLA rose significantly before the actual squeeze. Squeezes don't happen in a day when they are this huge. Considering everything about GME is larger than both VW and TSLA in terms of how many shorts and what's at stake, it makes sense that this would be far longer drawn out, with more pronounced stages than anything ever seen before. 

There have been plenty of boomer articles (which I'm sure you read like a playboy magazine jerking off to Dow movements), and DD on how the initial run up was not shorts covering, but actual interest in the stock. 

Do you really believe that shorts would have to buy up 140% of the float, so ALL of the float plus an additional 40%, while also competing with literal millions of people in the world to buy up the stock, and you think they managed that? Not impossible, but would be very impressive.

2021-05-14 08:48:26,wallstreetbets,"And mostly, we just like the stock"
2021-05-14 12:56:58,wallstreetbets,Short % of float is down over 100% since January?
2021-05-14 11:43:53,wallstreetbets,"Haha literally, if i even see moon, squueze, ape, hands in a title or comment i just instantly write it off as garbage junk"
2021-05-14 11:14:43,wallstreetbets,So many people seemed to miss your perfect little comment below that photo.
2021-05-14 10:45:59,wallstreetbets,TSLA didn’t have 200%+ SI
2021-05-14 08:49:10,wallstreetbets,"I’ll cheer for it, but I don’t believe in it :(
Go get em!"
2021-05-14 15:02:01,wallstreetbets,He’s just jealous cause the only hair he has is in his ass
2021-05-14 16:47:33,wallstreetbets,"coz this garbage keeps coming up in my feeds, fuckin all stop being tards, gme is OVER, move on, find something new

it was a shit company 10 years ago , its a shit company now, it will be a shit company in 10 years from now

you all really think you gonna be millionaires when gme goes to $5000 ? there is no melvin capital to fund this escapade anymore, you all just gonna gouge each others eyes out trying to float this pig, the only people who will get rich off this is the brokers and HFTs, skimming money off all your trades"
2021-05-14 16:55:35,wallstreetbets,[Buy me a drink and find out](https://i.imgur.com/WUW70gX.jpg) (lots less tidy here)
2021-05-14 17:20:53,wallstreetbets,You let them shut off the buy button tho.
2021-05-14 18:01:29,wallstreetbets,Rules went out the window when the mods meltdown at the end of Jan

2021-05-14 10:40:48,wallstreetbets,I’ll have you know that I only lost 23% yesterday.
2021-05-14 17:03:25,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-05-14 08:36:40,wallstreetbets,Just this erection from your post
2021-05-14 11:19:55,wallstreetbets,"Lol.

Edit: Read the whole post. Opinion stands. Thanks for putting this together, but the fact your brought up u/ControltheNarrative makes this entire post seem like SUSaF price anchoring. TBF, my brain is pretty smooth in the TA Dept."
2021-05-14 14:08:11,wallstreetbets,Lol maybe.. Hey thank you for the effort you put into this detailed analysis bro!
2021-05-14 19:29:22,wallstreetbets,Think about it
2021-05-14 13:59:35,wallstreetbets,I would agree. If it hits 2k then I think it’ll go a lot higher
2021-05-14 12:19:37,wallstreetbets,Post your beard slut
2021-05-14 10:52:10,wallstreetbets,"XX chromosomes, HRT, and a daily minoxidil chin lather?"
2021-05-14 13:04:54,wallstreetbets,"What, that you meant your bottom beard?"
2021-05-14 14:25:35,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 5 hours

2021-05-14 13:50:17,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, you guys are never satisfied. My phone camera is shitty, you all would be whining around, had I done that."
2021-05-14 11:57:36,wallstreetbets,dumb question... but i havent voted yet and was wondering (as an ape) am i supposed to vote yes on everything lol
2021-05-14 12:20:01,wallstreetbets,I didn't read a single word either. But I'm in
2021-05-14 12:44:34,wallstreetbets,Was looking for ^this
2021-05-14 12:42:59,wallstreetbets,So say we all
2021-05-14 13:52:22,wallstreetbets,"Thread title says ""Thousands""

FUD."
2021-05-14 12:30:04,wallstreetbets,Bullishit
2021-05-14 17:06:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that super fucking annoyed me. I would love to revive this subs culture, but GME isn't it. That's what ruined this subs culture, pushed out a lot of vets and completely changed the vibe of this place. It's hard to even get good information here because the apes all upvote each others retarded ass ideas. It's a bunch of new retards who barely understand options giving investing advice to a bunch of other retards now."
2021-05-14 18:44:28,wallstreetbets,"You have to understand, GME started here. This place is the birthplace of the gme movement, so for good or for bad these two things are inextricably linked and cannot be separated. 

This place created a monster and there's no denying that. Having this place spam with gme posts can get annoying, they have other subs for that. But here is where it all started so to turn your back on it totally is just gatekeeping. Just don't open the thread if you don't want to, fuck off."
2021-05-14 14:04:56,wallstreetbets,Satisfied?
2021-05-14 12:05:26,wallstreetbets,"Sure, should take no more than an hour! I’m gonna hurry"
2021-05-14 17:51:45,wallstreetbets,Based and sharing-pilled my purps are yours.
2021-05-14 08:36:48,wallstreetbets,Fucking masterpiece
2021-05-14 09:01:08,wallstreetbets,I'm gonna be watching a video of a dude eating poo aren't I?
2021-05-14 09:16:00,wallstreetbets,I think I'd take the ban if that were me
2021-05-14 09:00:15,wallstreetbets,Which one? I will set remind me later note.
2021-05-14 09:07:51,wallstreetbets,He must be actually retarded
2021-05-14 11:45:14,wallstreetbets,Well they are a Redditor. Who doesn't love their own shit here?
2021-05-14 12:38:38,wallstreetbets,When is the vote deadline?
2021-05-14 13:48:03,wallstreetbets,"That guy better be hiding about now.  Given the tweets GME been putting out, and the pics Cohen's been taking awfully close to yesterdays closed-door SEC meeting, methinks even the first day or two of tallying votes was enough to put them over the float."
2021-05-14 15:44:20,wallstreetbets,"I mean, what are the odds? Is it a slim too non chance or is it possible?"
2021-05-14 16:36:22,wallstreetbets,Ctfu
2021-05-14 19:32:51,wallstreetbets,">So if there is more votes than shares

You are confusing the float with the total number of outstanding shares.  The float does not include closely held shares, or restricted shares - but these shares can still be legally voted."
2021-05-14 09:07:19,wallstreetbets,Do you have a link to said comment?
2021-05-14 15:00:16,wallstreetbets,"Ah yeah definitely, but I wouldn’t assume too hard that someone would live up to their bet if they had to eat shit."
2021-05-14 18:05:51,wallstreetbets,If you wrote DD like this I'd read it.  No need to write A Tale of Two Cities

2021-05-14 11:08:35,wallstreetbets,What is it with silver? I saw that Wsb silver group and I was confused. Wasn’t silver one of the “smoke screens” MSM put up to throw everyone off gme? Did people actually buy into that and run with it?
2021-05-14 11:31:08,wallstreetbets,"All that stuff was at the same time. We want culture from before all this shit. 

Things existed before you apes."
2021-05-14 10:01:18,wallstreetbets,The autism dried up like GME’s volume.
2021-05-14 09:57:50,wallstreetbets,You've been missing out on some juicy DD these past 3 months.
2021-05-14 12:59:46,wallstreetbets,"damn you’re for real retarded, huh?"
2021-05-14 12:23:20,wallstreetbets,what did it say?
2021-05-14 13:16:06,wallstreetbets,I can see that.    I do agree with the other people responding that the bigger issue is he seems to be capping this at a few 1000...when we all know he left of 3 or 4 zeros.
2021-05-14 13:09:47,wallstreetbets,Agreed
2021-05-14 18:53:09,wallstreetbets,"Yea for real, OP isn’t even responding to people saying this is possible FUD and it’s to make people think the peak is a couple thousand, we all know the floor is 100 million, so I don’t know what this bearish SOB is tryna tell everyone"
2021-05-14 19:31:53,wallstreetbets,This
2021-05-14 12:34:40,wallstreetbets,Everyone who's been following knows 10 million is the floor.
2021-05-14 14:58:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that comes from his comparison with the VW squeeze. But he neglects that this one ended with Porsche letting short sellers off the hook. 

There won't be mercy this time tho and also the short positions on GME are many many times bigger! So don't blow your load prematurely guys"
2021-05-14 13:25:19,wallstreetbets,Read the whole damn thing
2021-05-14 11:39:46,wallstreetbets,That’s the HF target sell price for us. It’s the amount they can afford and still stay afloat.
2021-05-14 10:51:52,wallstreetbets,My concerns exactly
2021-05-14 12:49:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeh, this is a big concern. Trying to make us cash out at the 2-3k mark. Not happening. Much more value here. One will go first and everyone else will wait. After that they will reassess the potential damage. Then a dip back down to where we are (or lower) and then. Tick. Tick. Tick. BOOM!"
2021-05-14 11:13:56,wallstreetbets,"It’s just the first wave, compare that to TSLA after squeeze chart and stop worrying"
2021-05-14 10:58:01,wallstreetbets,No more. That’s shallot.
2021-05-14 09:26:32,wallstreetbets,"My name is superior!

Also this shit stock is never seeing 1000$ no matter how Much you guys want it to"
2021-05-14 11:18:35,wallstreetbets,I like turtles
2021-05-14 13:24:08,wallstreetbets,"Well that might be your problem. It’s not what you like, it’s the investor.

2021-05-14 11:19:42,wallstreetbets,Why not
2021-05-14 11:10:15,wallstreetbets,"I just assume if someone takes the energy to comment “10M a sHaRE,”they are both serious and high as shit on gasoline fumes."
2021-05-14 10:48:46,wallstreetbets,That's cool and all but some other guy says amc market cap will eclipse the entirety of the world's wealth. So I've got that going for me.
2021-05-14 11:35:24,wallstreetbets,"Usually cuz it's missing the ""and why part""."
2021-05-14 08:48:13,wallstreetbets,6/9 is the real catalyst
2021-05-14 13:07:05,wallstreetbets,Still don't understand this
2021-05-14 13:38:32,wallstreetbets,"It's like the Q nonsense at this point. ""Here's how GME can still squeeze!"" is starting to sound like ""Here's how Trump can still win!""

And just like the Q idiots, when their ""squeeze will happen tomorrow!"" theories don't come true, they just push the date further and further back and change the narrative to fit the squeeze not having happened."
2021-05-14 11:37:44,wallstreetbets,In five years they will still be posting dd and yelling LOOK AT THIS TASTY DIP and GUYS WERE TOMORROW QUAD WITCHING MOON DAY
2021-05-14 13:52:54,wallstreetbets,Jealous?
2021-05-14 12:53:01,wallstreetbets,Doubt he’s even a bagholder since he never posts positions on any of these magical TA posts claiming the squeeze is just another month or two away.

2021-05-14 13:57:48,wallstreetbets,I went with the board I trust Ryan cohen
2021-05-14 12:17:26,wallstreetbets,That is what the Board is suggesting
2021-05-14 18:32:49,wallstreetbets,"Do whatever floats your boat. The board is recommending yes to all, but that is the same with every single proxy you'll ever get. Baring some anomaly I haven't yet encountered in my 6 months of trading. 

The main thing is voting."
2021-05-14 15:34:59,wallstreetbets,I only voted no on keeping George Sherman on the board.  Dude almost single handedly killed the company with his refusal to adapt to the future.

2021-05-14 16:12:50,wallstreetbets,"I would say there's a possibility for it, whole GME thing is so fuckd up that nobody knows. I can't say odds for that but I wouldn't make this bet. So I would say it's 50/50.

But If there's more votes than shares this dude's thousands could be just a pitstop"
2021-05-14 09:13:57,wallstreetbets,Different sub but I could try to find it if you want
2021-05-14 09:18:13,wallstreetbets,"With these $10 movements up and down happening almost every 3 days I wish I have been, couldna been making bank for a while"

The LBMA audit that came out on Monday shows that they were short the same amount of silver that the comex claimed to have acquired during the first day of silver squeeze. JP Morgan is the custodian of slv, they were just fined 900 million in 2019 for manipulating metals markets on “thousands of occasions”. We are all fighting the same retard fight against the bankers."
2021-05-14 13:44:55,wallstreetbets,Probably that the mods left it because it says the top is $2200 not 2 mil. Just a guess.
2021-05-14 12:27:49,wallstreetbets,Following to hear. I see the all seeing eye award. I want to see!

2021-05-14 13:17:49,wallstreetbets,OP you need to clarify this in the post. Apes are assuming that the squeeze stops at 2k and has nothing left after. Please clarify this
2021-05-14 11:49:24,wallstreetbets,These jokes are making me cry.

2021-05-14 16:10:42,wallstreetbets,"Finviz, Ortex, Fintel etc all show less than 30% short interest. So yes, I am sure about that.

The only potential for the mother of all squeezes was when it was around 140%. It will never get that close again and any hope of that squeeze still happening at this point is just delusion. 30% interest is still pretty significant and i’m sure it will remain somewhat volatile but the dream has been over for a while."
2021-05-14 14:41:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah its hard to tell when finra is hiding data. But it must be sky high after months of rabid shorting.
2021-05-14 15:04:42,wallstreetbets,Lol probably takes him 45 wipes per shit

2021-05-14 11:29:29,wallstreetbets,Was it ever discussed seriously? The only people I’ve ever heard anyone talk about silver as an investment have been doomsday preppers or the “the whole economy is a sham! We need to go back to gold and silver to back our currency!” type

No where in this article does it say Tesla is getting into biogas. It says that Tesla is looking to sell clean energy credits to this market.

Tesla isn’t getting into gas cars or anything like that. Tesla is going to continue pursuing the market of selling its clean energy credits.

Nothing is changing other than who can buy the energy credits."

2021-05-14 08:03:22,wallstreetbets,You think?
2021-05-14 14:10:59,wallstreetbets,"That is not at all what the article says.

Currently there are some entities generating electricity with biogas, and they sell those clean energy credits. Tesla wants to be able to sell clean energy credits in that market. The article then mentions how some farmers (who use biogas to generate electricity) are mad at that proposal because it would appear that the Biden administration would be prioritizing Tesla over people who _actually_ use biogas.

Tesla is not getting into the business of biogas. It only wants to sell credits to that market."

I bought a put this morning while it was dipping. Scalped a couple hundred dollars and sold it to close. At least I thought I did.

I don’t know what happened, but the order never executed. I was multitasking, it was probably my own fault.

I come back to the computer a few hours later and my account is trash. The fucking put never closed and just bled out.

2021-05-14 06:37:22,wallstreetbets,"Futures are continuing their rally, with tech stocks leading the way. The Nasdaq is up 1.1%. Russell 2000 0.7% higher. S&P 500 0.6% to the good and Dow Industrials ahead by 0.4%. That’s as of 0625.

This follows a day of nice gains for risk assets. There was a reversal after some pre-market selling. At the close the major indexes were up 1% and change (except for the Nasdaq, which gained only 0.7%).

No immediate indication what’s driving the relief rally, but I have my ideas. You have to listen to the podcast though. Not gonna type it.

Stocks have a bunch of ground to make up to turn green for the week. Nasdaq is still down 4.6% for the week. S&P almost 3% in the red. Dow down 2%. 

Couple of data releases today. Retail sales at 0830. Expectation is for a 0.8% increase in April, a major slowdown from the 9.8% advance in March. Industrial production at 0915 will shed some light on supply-chain bottlenecks. 

If those reports beat estimates we should see more buying, though probably not quite enough to turn us green for the week."

2021-05-14 06:10:40,wallstreetbets,"Could be another day of ups and/or downs today, so here are some tips for you apes to stay on top of your game.

Stay hydrated - whisky is best here, but if before noon where you are, consider a healthier clear spirit like vodka or pure grain alcohol.

Eat a nutritious and balanced breakfast - make sure to include all five major crayon colours, and plenty of tendies for protein. Bananas are acceptable.

Perform one act of kindness - make your wife’s boyfriend a cup of coffee to start his day right - he’s probably very tired.

Do some mindfulness mantras - chanting a mantra over and over again can be very helpful in keeping the mind calm. A few suggestions include; ‘Holy Moly’, ‘I like the stock’, or ‘To the moon’.

Take some time away from your computer screen - in this day and age, sitting for too long in front of your computer can be very taxing. Be good to yourself, and occasionally switch to staring at your phone screen instead.

Good luck out there today, retards."

|NIO|$ 40.00|22%|
|NIO|$ 43.00|31%|
|SPY|$ 430.00|3%|
|AAPL|$ 135.00|6%|
|AMD|$ 83.50|12%|
|VIAC|$ 43.00|11%|

Bumble BMBL to introduce a ‘Bumble Bagholders’ mode in addition to the date and BFF modes.

You can match with likeminded retards who also baghold shit stocks at the top, such as NKLA, GME, PLTR etc. The user with the heaviest bags has to make the first move. Instead of buying boosts you buy squeezes. If you don’t get on with the match you can short ladder attack their profile, which removes them from your match list."

2021-05-14 13:41:08,wallstreetbets,"Posting this again...

For everyone thinking about buying AMC:

**It is ten times 2016 market cap levels,** 

It won't see ""2019"" revenue until 20**23**,

*It still has debt*, no new innovation, no new tech, no advertising, no marketing, no acquisitions, no mergers, no change in leadership, no opening new theatres, no renovating existing theatres.

People demographically in the USA have become **less and less interested in movie theatres for the last 10 years**. We are about *to potentially enter another economic downturn because of gigainflation*. Cinemas don't do well when the poors have no money.

People were opening short positions at 30, 25, 20, 15 and 10 - they will need AMC to be in the 150-200 range to even begin margin calls... and either way they can *justify to their lender* that they don't have to cover. Why? BECAUSE THE STOCK IS **FUNDAMENTALLY OVERVALUED**.

Institutions can *negotiate their covenants with the lenders*. They do **not have to cover.**

If AMC wanted a squeeze, they'd have issued something to force shorts to cover. Like a dividend... or split or anything.

Instead, they have *only done everything to help shorts cover by diluting the stock*. $1,000,000,000 has been raised by AMC through stock dilutions. What has that been used for? To prevent *bankruptcy*. That isn't bullish. They *still have debt*.

Who do you think was initiating those buys yesterday? Did retail suddenly all decide in unison that yesterday was the day to go all in?

**Absolutely not.** It was sparked by an institution. Conveniently we see AMC dilute the stock *on the same day*.

AM🤡s have ***WAY*** too much faith in this company.

WAY too much man."

BABA at $260 its surely a steal theres no way it could go any lower, its rated a buy from value investors like charlie munger and growth investors like cathie woods and has a 30% upside🤡

BABA at $229 once the anti trust judgement comes through from the CCP as long as they dont break apart the company the stock has to do well🤡

BABA at $240 see i was right ill average up on shares now thats its only recieved a $2.8 billion dollar fine and the company isnt broken up🤡

BABA at $220 WOW BABA is really undervalued before earnings, let me grab some calls, the miss on eps should be fine since they were fined $2.8 billion and that should be priced in but i expect growth in its cloud sector, robotics, goods and service and total revenue to beat so it should just be easy money🤡

BABA at $206 Well im out of money to average down but it cant get any lower, its the biggest tech  company in the only country that has had a positive GDP during covid, on top of that china has a population of 1.4 billion so theres even more growth to be had🤡

BABA at $170 well BABA now has a p/e of some oil companies and thats a dying sector yet BABA has insane growth in different areas and using all their profits to reinvest in their company and innovate🤡

BABA has been delisted on the US stock exchange and my shares are nearly worthless, its fine im sure China will take over the world and my shares of BABA will grant me nobility in the new world order🤡"

Bought in 3 days ago, whole market dipped and this thing is printing. Stock went down like crazy because of the fear of accounting errors, turns out it was nothing. Currently way under analyst prediction (hitting the lowest one now). 
I’m super happy I followed my gut on this and didn’t let this one go. Even my risky June options look like they will turn out just Fine. Not sure if it’s too late to hop on the ride though.
Also hoping that this thing has been shorted excessively, which is likely as it’s been just going down hill."

2021-05-14 07:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Everyone thinking about buying AMC:

**It is over triple 2016 market cap levels,** 

It won't see ""2019"" revenue until 20**23**,

*It still has debt*, no new innovation, no new tech, no advertising, no marketing, no acquisitions, no mergers, no change in leadership, no opening new theatres, no renovating existing theatres.

People demographically in the USA have become **less and less interested in movie theatres for the last 10 years**. We are about *to potentially enter another economic downturn because of gigainflation*. Cinemas don't do well when the poors have no money.

People were opening short positions at 30, 25, 20, 15 and 10 - they will need AMC to be in the 150-200 range to even begin margin calls... and either way they can *justify to their lender* that they don't have to cover. Why? BECAUSE THE STOCK IS **FUNDAMENTALLY OVERVALUED**.

Institutions can *negotiate their covenants with the lenders*. They do **not have to cover.**

If AMC wanted a squeeze, they'd have issued something to force shorts to cover. Like a dividend... or split or anything.

Instead, they have *only done everything to help shorts cover by diluting the stock*. $1,000,000,000 has been raised by AMC through stock dilutions. What has that been used for? To prevent *bankruptcy*. That isn't bullish. 

Who do you think was initiating those buys yesterday? Did retail suddenly all decide in unison that yesterday was the day to go all in?

**Absolutely not.** It was sparked by an institution. Conveniently we see AMC dilute the stock *on the same day*.

AM🤡s have ***WAY*** too much faith in this company.

WAY too much man."

2021-05-14 07:50:18,wallstreetbets,Truth. Just attempt to swing on the way up and then profit on the massive dump it takes...
2021-05-14 07:56:21,wallstreetbets,Something is up with amc if not why would the Pelosi’s buy so much stock last week.
2021-05-14 07:56:49,wallstreetbets,"Not wrong, but your forgetting sentiment is very important. Right now there is still bullish sentiment. Same thing happened with Tesla and it crushed shorts all the way up. It’s just now starting to die because the sentiment changed. Meme stocks are never about fundamental. As long as people still believe it will run and buy in at large volume it will continue. Fundamentally it should be shorted, but that would burn your money faster than a California wild fire 9/10 times!"

However, I watched Godzilla vs Kong at home and would have MUCH rather seen the two alien fucknuts beat each other’s ass in an IMAX room.

There is a huge international market that has not really received any attention and some companies have a pretty strong footing already established. There also is too much emphasis on the recreational side and not enough on hemp as an industry disrupter. Just my 2 cents for what it's worth.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"All you guys talk about is GME/AMC While ignoring the brewing short squeeze in $lmnd (currently &gt;30% SI). Stock could be set up for a major bounce due to being heavily oversold (down some 60-70% since highs in Jan).

Citron Research (Andrew Left) came up with a lame short report yesterday after shorting it down 20% the prior day, only for it to blow up in his face &amp; the stock running +7% yesterday, leaving them miserably unable to cover the short. Citron Research desperately followed up with 2 more tweets intraday, but management immediately clapped back directly on twitter, and the stock rallied further. 

It’s interesting to note that 6x the daily average volume was traded on Wednesday, where it fell -20% despite an excellent earnings print. This could possibly be multiple hedge funds collabing behind this short.

Andrew Left said his firm will stop “activist short selling” after the GME blow up, only to go back on his words a few months later. What’s worse, he’s shorting a charitable public benefit corp in Lemonade Inc.

This is a $3.5B mkt. cap stock with $1.2B in cash and no debt… Being shorted as if they’re headed for eminent bankruptcy. A 89% YoY growth beast is literally being traded at close to it’s book value/share. That’s insane.

TLDR: let the Lemonade squeeze begin 🍋. Jan2023 $200c 🚀



*EDIT:

Jesus I am shocked that all logic and arguments I’ve put forth are literally being ignored by many here in the comments just because my account was registered 2 months ago? How shallow minded. Consider this post taken down; I am no longer responding to your arbitrary comments that make zero reference to the content I’ve written. This was supposed to be a fun DD but instead all I’ve gotten were insults (not even funny type of insults, just nasty insults.)

Thank you WSB for showing me how valued critical thinking is among this community (clearly not a lot). Nothing personal, I wish you all well. Just clearly not the place for intellectual discussions as I initially thought. I’ll fuck off to somewhere other than here to discuss investing ideas.

According to Statista,  **Luxury apparel market value worldwide** will reach 84.04 billion U.S. dollars by 2025. ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/941156/luxury-apparels-market-value-worldwide/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/941156/luxury-apparels-market-value-worldwide/))

$FTCH, or Farfetch, basically has a monopoly on the segment, with exponential revenues and a stable path to profitability. EBITDA was positive in 2020 end. 

Check the earnings for yesterday: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/farfetch-limited-ftch-reports-q1-214509242.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/farfetch-limited-ftch-reports-q1-214509242.html) \- 4 conclusions: exponential growth, path to profits, backed by giants, incredible product.

Additionally, the biggest market worldwide and by far the least exploited is CHINA. Farfetch is already dominant on the market with a **HUGE partnership with Alibaba**, the joint partnership with Tmall (basically the biggest luxury marketplace in **China, that $FTCH now rules**). 

Backed by major hedge funds, the stock price took a **GIGANTIC HIT with the ARCHEGOS scandal,** leading the stock price to a gigantic undervaluation (price targets reach as high as 120$, while current price is 38$). 

Combine this with the recent downfall in growth stocks due to inflation concerns, and we have an enourmous BULL thesis here. 

Per my analysis, the stock price should **triple in price by 2021 end.**

Prepare yourselves apes, cause summer is coming!

 **How did Floyd Mayweather become such a legendary boxer?**

He understood the human behaviors of his adversary.

Repeatable sequences his opponents like to throw, over and over. He observed and learned.

He was then able to anticipate and get that edge we are all looking for!

**The same approach  with the  charting .**

Check out the identified structures. Amplitude and length doesn't have to be the same, but the pattern. Then observe the subsequent moves in silver price once those patterns completed!

Silver's open interest (including options) MACD shows an insane setup for silver.

Question is... how high? Greedy analog move yields 73$ in Q4 2021.

You must understand the HUGE tidal wave in motion that will sky rocket silver prices.

This is the M2 money supply vs gold. Currently gold is waiting for the latest explosion in M2 to unwind as it let's the 12 month moving average catch up.

&#x200B;

Take away for this chart is the time bomb... Tic Toc....

 Okay, this is THE chart you guys wanna see.  Well, same as it's big brother gold... it has a +900% move baked in the cake. From a silver price of around 27$, that brings it up in excess of 200$ for 3 years period .  This is life-changing money if played right. 

 Now, here is the actual picture. WTF?!?! Pretty insane M1 money supply expansion. That is fuel for silverto climb up. Like some folks say, it's gonna need a rocket ship now to catch up.

2021-05-14 10:47:24,wallstreetbets,"There are two elements driving the case of the silver squeeze.  


1.) This charting explains why silver is massively undervalued relative to M1 and how much it's held down despite rising industrial demand and massive retail demand.  


2.) The other factor is banks have short positions at 92% of the annual global supply.  These banks can't unwind their position easily. They did this while M1 was blowing up and were not paying attention.  


Other DD over on WSS yesterday indicates that COMEX may have run out of silver in the last week. Record outflows from the exchanges abruptly shifted to a net of 19 contracts out of the vault. LBMA admitted overstating their holdings by 3,300 tonnes. Data shows deliveries are drying last week. You can't deliver silver you don't have. 🔥🏛️🔥

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$DASH - Is it overvalued? DASH reported yesterday their Q1 results.

Revenue was 1.08B vs 995.65M as expected, but the loss was 0.34 vs 0.10 expected.

Their gross order volume was 9.9B... BUT, the company is forecasting 35-38B in orders for the year... so no growth, perhaps a decline (well if they are forecasting no growth and possibly a decline, it will likely be much worse) and they lost money this quarter... They are forecasting EBITDA (which Warren Buffet hates as you ignore your worst cost, depreciation, per him) for the year of 0-300M, so let's say it will be $0 or less.

So to recap a company with a market cap at closing ($115 sp) of 37B in a year like this, when delivery of food took off, will not make any money... The rest of the year they don't expect to grow or make money, but somehow people think in a competitive landscape this company will go on to grow and be very profitable one day?

What the heck am I missing? I am not selling my Puts, this company makes no sense. When lockup expires (I think in June), that will help people realize the idiocy of this. I would really love to hear the bull case given the Q1 numbers to understand why I am wrong.

Positions 30X 8/21 $100P. Cost was $5.5, price at closing was $9.75. I assume with the uptick after hours they will be way down in value."

2021-05-14 04:08:06,wallstreetbets,"Market share

Grub has a high cap for being a shit service shit stock already peaked and not bringing in much $$$

I think dash will buy out grub

I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kladql/dash_vs_grub/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) on it months ago 

Dash also has corporate deals now Macy’s, gme, covid test distribution, Walmart, vons to name a few 
My bull case focused on dash gaining market share in good side buying out grub and maybe Uber eats and new corporate deals making certain places exclusive delivery from dash such as the names listed above but also popular fast food like chick fil A which gets priority on orders and sets a precedent for future deals such as Taco Bell McDonald’s

I think DASH is overvalued puts are the way but it will come out on top of food delivery apps so keep its valuation in comparison to GRUB ( closest competitor since Uber has other revenue)"
2021-05-14 04:12:26,wallstreetbets,"Shit u actually right about that. Undoubtedly the biggest players in the game. 

With that being said, fuck em. (I will check your post out, but fuck doordash)"
2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Deflation - how do I play it? Hi all!


*Current situation*: everyone appears to be convinced that we will be plagued by crazy inflation in the near future

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/americans-fear-highest-inflation-in-nearly-a-decade.html

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/13/top-bank-of-england-economist-warns-of-1970s-style-price-inflation

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/upshot/inflation-is-here-what-now.html

*Idea*: I believe inflation will be short lived and we will revert to a deflationary environment in less than two years. Briefly, the rationale behind that is (1) stimulus checks/helicopter money programs will end, (2) the supply chain will go back to full capacity and demand will be met by offer, (3) no countries have implemented long standing relief programs, (4) demographics are going down and labor cost is going up, (5) globalization is increasing competition between companies, keeping prices down, (6) technological advancements push prices down.

You can agree or disagree with such an idea, but we are not here to assess whether I’m a moron or not.


*Question*: how do I bet on deflation? The idea I had was to take the short side of some of the inflation assets, but a short play is not sustainable for a retail investor on the long term due to daily fees. 

So, how do I play deflation?"
2021-05-14 03:31:03,wallstreetbets,"Since you can't afford shorting or floating rate swaps, why dont you do the opposite of what inflation believers would do? Tech companies usually do terrible during higher inflation times but pretty good during lower times, hypothetically, they trade on discount during high inflation, that means you can buy and hold for 2 years without any real fees. Also, empirically, growth companies trade on discount as well. I would personally disagree on that, because I believe that growth companies have increased their corporate savings in excess and we cant compare them with past data anymore, but history so far disagrees on me. We will see. Basically, if you want to play  2 years in advance, look around what ppl sell right now to hedge against inflation and buy them cheaper. This is not financial advice, just my opinion, but if you become rich out of I'd appreciate a free drink."
2021-05-14 02:58:59,wallstreetbets,"""Cash is not only the ultimate hedge, but also the only investment that rises in value during deflation. As stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities are all losing value, the amount of cash required to purchase these assets is falling, by definition. In other words, the relative value of cash is going up."" - some google search"

It’s about the narrative. As retail investors, our edge comes from agility. We can move in and out of trades without moving the market. Regardless of what you believe, play the narrative in the short term.

Or if you are a glutton for punishment and want to make a 2 year trade, buy leap puts on commodity indexes."
2021-05-14 08:49:09,wallstreetbets,you are confusing a deflationary environment with a disinflationary environment.
2021-05-14 09:35:59,wallstreetbets,"I believe inflation is here to stay, because the money printed might actually be in the hands of people willing to spend it, and they will bid up costs at any rate until either their money is gone, or not worth what it was. Maybe the only thing that could cause deflation in the short term is a mass hoarding of cash by people who won't spend it, I.E. the wealthy or the government?"

2021-05-14 03:04:19,wallstreetbets,"Sure - only problem is that you need to have *heaps* of cash to play like that. Which I don’t have.

So, I need a trade, namely a mechanism through which I can invest my money and turn them into more money by betting on deflation."

2021-05-14 01:10:10,wallstreetbets,"I’d have to agree. I love going to the movies but AMC’s current business model has no way to grow. They were struggling pre-Covid and even as they open back up it will be limited capacity. Then selling shares is the only chance they have to stay afloat, but for how long?

2021-05-14 01:28:40,wallstreetbets,Yea. Because the borrowed MORE money..not because they MADE money. That’s like having a credit card with a very high limit and no job to pay off the CC bill with. 😂😂😂
2021-05-14 09:18:45,wallstreetbets,"Could you recreate the exp at home?

2021-05-14 09:26:24,wallstreetbets,"All I'm saying is its not exactly like the VHS+TV experience used to be back in the day. Of course I might still consider going to the theatres, but honestly that has already gotten a very rare event pre-covid. And I'm not exactly missing that expierence that much anymore to be honest thanks to my home cinema. I do miss going out to eat, socialize and drink though."
2021-05-14 12:52:04,wallstreetbets,Pre-Covid they were filling the theater at anywhere from $10 - $20 a seat. But Concessions generate most of their profit anyway. Which I find would be difficult to expand upon. Also I know of a lot of AMC’s that were already serving alcohol. I used to do insurance work for them and love the company. But their business model still needs to change if they expect to grow.
2021-05-14 01:35:04,wallstreetbets,"The company entered 2020 with $10.35 billion in total debt, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence

Since then, the financial health of the company has gotten worse, but it’s stock price has gone up....so. Are you buying the stock based on its underlying value?  Or are you buying it because you like holding bags at the end of parties?"
2021-05-14 01:40:37,wallstreetbets,"Well to be honest with you I’m buying for the squeeze and long term.  But THIS IS POST COVID, not pre covid and theres record numbers of people going back to movies.  And no shit the financial situation got worse after covid hit, they weren’t even open.  😂
Times have changed, and people will and are going back to movies in droves.   As of right now, the company could never be doing better in terms of money.  Adam Aaron literally said that it’s the most cash in reserves they’ve ever had.  I’m holding because I  100% believe in this stock, and the 3 million share holders already holding it, I’m confident we’re gonna be just fine.  ✌🏻"

Make your money. That’s why we are here....and if you can make it from a squeeze then heck yea dude. Rack that shit in...but just be carful long term man. Same leadership that took the company to shot is the same leadership that’s telling you how great they are through 2021. GME shook the top and now seem to be standing on solid ground. Thats the difference and pretty much, thats what I’m trying to say"
2021-05-14 01:56:45,wallstreetbets,"Well hey you’re entitled to your own personal opinion.   Believe me though I’m careful, none of my investments so far have led me astray.  I never invest in things without extensive research because I just hate the thought of losing money on my investments.  Plus another thing too, many streaming services announced they that they are discontinuing direct to streaming services like HBO Max for example, and Pixar just admitted that they are upset that Disney is releasing their newest movie on Disney+ as an exclusive.  They wanna make money off the theatres like the rest of us.  If you ever wanna PM me too I can try and look for all this info for you.  🤙🏻"

In this the short seller allegations against Clover Many say it has the potential to 2x in the next few weeks, but does it? Is Clover Health Stock still a Buy?! Clover's high membership growth, short seller Hindenburg's accusations, the competition with United Health (UNH), the opportunity in the online health industry,  Clover uses a software, named clover assistance, that improves every interaction at the point of care with machine learning. Physicians currently use clover assistants to help them deliver better care to patients, which gives better outcomes to patients and physicians as well. The company currently manages Medicare advantage plans and receives roughly $10,000 in annual revenue per patient. 

Few weeks ago, Hindenburg, the famous short seller, accused Chamath, the “king of spacs”, of luring retail investors through CLOV. This instantly caused the stock to drop. We saw a pop when Clover and Chamath responded to this attack. CLOV took this attack in an opportunity to make investors know them better. Between both CLOV and Chamath, they responded to the claims point by point and even provided more information. Altogether, it shows that Clover has nothing to hide. Chamath is known for finding growth opportunities and has helped many great companies go public such as Virgin Galactic. Chamath has a reputation to keep up so I don’t think we would jeopardize that with a bad investment. This is not a DD do your own and this is straight up plagiarized information. But it’s all facts I ain’t a financial adviser I’m just advising you apes 🦍 to buy this stock and watch it fly.

This is one of a few tech diamonds in the dirt right now. Mainly because they are growing faster than other tech companies while having a pristine balance sheet and very low P/S valuation. I challenge you to find another 3B annual revenue company that has better metrics in those 3 categories. EV is just ridiculously low when you consider 1.6B in cash and no debt.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Rackspace DD - The fact is that Facebook also had a $3.8B market cap once Extending on some guys RXT due diligence post the other day, my investment thesis goes something like this:

We are a large, profitable tech company, that does not currently have a tech value multiple (in fact it is cheap compared to pretty much any business). We also have a cost of production which is among the lowest of any in our industry.

An opportunity with such apparent strength and uniqueness needs analysis and understanding as to why it has been overlooked thus far.

Imo firstly, COP is lower than Silicon Valley because of our location. 

Secondly, this opportunity has not been recognised yet, because the company is not based in Silicon Valley, where the usual tech investors and tech marketing is. This investor oversight may be a combination of home-town bias, the biologically limited attentional capacity of people, and the overwhelming press focus on the front-end tech businesses. 

Location is actually not a relevant constraint on the potential of the business, because software is a product that does not require shipping."

2021-05-13 23:26:09,wallstreetbets,"I haven’t followed the previous discussion but I assume the global chip shortage will affect them. With customers having trouble sourcing hardware they might turn to private cloud offerings like that from RXT. That would be great for them (and other similar hosting providers), but what happens if RXT runs out of hardware? We are seeing lead times reaching one year for some rather common equipment.
Contrary to your statement location is a concern: round trip times for cloud applications are important. Not for all, though. Similarly regulatory concerns (E.g GDPR) are important and outright prevent some customers from consuming any of the services, even when hosted in Europe."
2021-05-14 00:06:25,wallstreetbets,"Did you even look at their financials? They are massively overleveraged after they got the ol' private equity treatment. They are a couple bad quarters from going tits up. Their business also relies on inefficiencies that currently exist between different web based cloud services. If one or more of those services changes their offerings or services slightly it could make rackspace no longer able to add value for customers.

If they do succeed, the extremely high leverage will mean you get an outsized payout, but it's such a massive if and in a business where they don't really control their own fate. There's a reason their price is this low, and it's not their location."

Those three companies have massive datacenters for their own internal needs that they also use for hosting, whereas Rackspace is pretty much all hosting. It seems near inconceivable for Rackspace to compete in building the infrastructure.

In fact, prior to COVID it seems Rackspace was barely growing and if anything was perhaps in decline. COVID gave them a boost, but I would expect the longer-term trend to continue which is not good for them. I just don't see any real reason why to be bullish on them."

What is this DD in any case... Not having a tech valuation (whatever is meant by that) is not a good thing, it possibly means investors think your company is junk. As to their cost of production being from the lowest, no clue what is meant by that as their financials seem to say another story."

That being said, i considered buying far OTM put LEAPS on TSLA. Didn't go trough with it because i'm better than that, but i mean, they would be 99% free money. TSLA was a slow short squeeze that then gained traction and kept going due to a pretty massive snowball effect, that's it. Nothing new, just the market doing market things."

A reminder that you can slowly liquidate a losing stock to negative gear and offset capital gains tax for the fin year you bought it AND the next

Eg: Sell a long held stock this fin year, sale income is a capital gain.

Buy another thing you plan to hold for a year.

Fucked up and bought something that shit the bed? Sell half of it to reduce capital gains made from the winning sale made this fin year. Sell the other half to reduce capital gains tax made on the other winning trade next fin year.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Boeing Airlines as a Potential Hedge against Inflation According to the Q1 earning report “The plane manufacturer reported a net loss of $561 million for the first three months of 2021 on revenue of $15.2 billion”. 

 $318 million dollars of this loss was related to a “318 million pretax charge related to issues with a supplier for the modified 747 planes used as Air Force One,” after a contractor tasked with building the interior failed to meet its contractual obligations—highlighting  logistical and supply bottlenecks in the production process: Boeing has filed a suit in court alleging losses: and still remains committed to fulfilling the contract on time.

Finally Boeing ended The first quarter with $63.6 billion in total debt, unchanged from the previous quarter (more on this debt later and how 30b in bonds sold last year is all of a sudden looking smart).

Despite what was a poor 1q earnings report for Boeing,the bright side about Boeing’s situation —given the current market environment of rising commodity and production costs— is that at least they have plenty of Already Made, ready to go Airplanes --they will go up in value due to inflation ---: , currently the 737 Max models sell for around  100-120 million.

Given a modest, conservative rise in inflation: these planes are likely to go up at least 2 million a piece. Now if Boeing can just manage to sell the rest of these planes —- The current backlog is aprox 4,700– and selling them at current prices: and not taking into account inflation or price increases Boeing can walk away from this not only clearing its debt but with 40 billion in pure profit after expenses.


Boeing expects to clear the backlog by the end of this year: but even if they don’t that could end up being a good thing for Boeing airlines as they watch their inventory of commercial jetliners appreciate due to inflation. 

In any case, while some tech stocks are going to need more and more money to grow, the BA 30billion war chest should be sufficient to get them through 2022. 

And the day they turn that debt into profit is the day Boeing shoots right up to $300 —could happen by q1 next year. And after it breaks $300 all bets are off: who knows how big it could get: maybe it ends up being the winner in the emerging space industry , maybe another war pops off in the Middle East and defense / military revenue grows even more: this could be a 6-800$+ stock one day... 


So what do you think Wall Street bets is Boeing airlines a smart hedge for rising inflation?"
2021-05-13 22:44:50,wallstreetbets,"That’s some 5-head DD, i just like BA because I think they’re among a small number of companies the government can’t allow to fail"
2021-05-13 22:37:09,wallstreetbets,Not sure how it is with the manufacturers but there has been a joke I’ve heard for years that the easiest way to get a million dollars is to invest 10 million in airlines
2021-05-14 04:44:24,wallstreetbets,"First of all Boeing is not an airline! Couldn't get past that, so nothing else you typed matters."
2021-05-14 02:55:27,wallstreetbets,"Sigh.  This is not how airplane sales work.  Airlines get discounts off the asking price — can be up to 50%.  The Southwest order likely had that level of discount.  The 737 Max will not go automatically go up with inflation; orders were cancelled as more news came out about the planning and production.

Your entire premise is flawed as you assume the planes sell for list price.  They do not."

I think there's still a lot of room to move up in price now that the 737 fiasco and pandemic aren't having as big an impact.

2021-05-14 01:13:16,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you call it “Boeing Airlines” despite the first line of the quoted report describing it correctly as a “plane manufacturer” tells me everything we need to know about how solid this  DD is.

Also, the backlog is of planes that are already sold in the most part (and the ones that are not sold are cancelled orders). So there is no way those planes are worth 100 million each, especially because you did not account for discounting. 

I would not touch Boeing stock no matter what pretty numbers they throw out in the earnings or their spin."

Military contracts: Good!

Recent track record for reliability: BAD

New products blow away competition: Good!

New products grounded/delayed: BAD

Too big to fail government investments: Good!

Current electronics supply chain probs: BAD

I cheer for Boeing but the unpredictability and constant surprise hurdles make it too hard for me personally to dump money into. Maybe a good long-term investment but with the push for more economical competing products (“hyper loop” dreams and mag train networks to connect major cities) and competitors like Airbus and Lockheed Martin making strides while they stall reminds me of Intel Vs AMD over the last 5 years.

2021-05-13 23:26:55,wallstreetbets,Same.  Except the recovery has been pissed poor compared to GE and airlines.  Still plenty of room to run up this year.  Question is when.
2021-05-13 22:47:05,wallstreetbets,"Airlines are volatile. No doubt. But Boeing has very little competition across many programs, not just commercial airplanes. Military contracts are often 20~40 year commitments even though it’s having a tough time on the commercial side, their defense group is still profitable.

I invested in them at the peak and then doubled down and re-doubled and re-doubled again when the stock was taking a dive. My high price was around $245 and low price was around $140, and it’s $222 at the moment.

I do expect it to clear $300 easily, possibly $400 in the next five to ten years. So it’s a long hold for me."

However, they only get a small down payment at order. Rest of the money comes in milestone payments during mfg and delivery. 

Also yes discounts are big and kept a trade secret, airbus does the same. The list price on a 737 max is around $100M, they never sell for $100M but those are their cheapest plane.

Treys trades talked about how he lost half of over 20k+ put into AMC when they sold his shares for less the reason why he switched out and is now on webull. Forgot what his last broker was might have been fidelity?
2021-05-14 01:43:05,wallstreetbets,I had suspected vanguard was shit and now it is confirmed. He had his shares in a cash account. IRA or not they had no reason to sell. He was not in a margin call. Fuck vanguard
2021-05-13 22:21:34,wallstreetbets,Apparently you can’t invest from an IRA. I needed to move the trade to my brokerage account. Lesson learned the hard way

I’ve talked with them on the phone twice to explain my account balance because if you’re trading (on margin)frequently and withdrawing/depositing weekly, you need a damn accountant to figure out how much money you actually have to buy stocks."
2021-05-14 07:43:49,wallstreetbets,Yep that's why traders don't use vanguard. That and many other reasons.

The first vehicle will be manufactured with Magna, another powerhouse for auto production.  With the current Short float at 20%+ FSR is a great candidate for a runup that started today after hours, will carry into tomorrow and continue next week(ER monday).

Fisker is a long position. They will be bringing an EV to market for less than $30,000, which will make the vehicle accessible to damn near anybody. The deal with Foxconn will allow Fisker to take a vehicle from concept to production within 1 year. Nothing about the fundamentals have changed...and the next bump will be when the company announces where the car will be manufactured (hopefully Wisconsin).

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Palantir, how to build a theoretically perfect business, the possible incoming golden age of America, and why you shouldn't feel stupid for buying the dip. by now you all should be sick to death of hearing about Palantir. shit stock, hype company, everyone knows this already. most of you barely understand what they do. some of you do understand, and root for the potential of the birth of yet another trillion dollar company, but that's not what I'm going to talk about. There is an aspect to all this that I have not yet seen discussed anywhere, and as soon as people figure it out, I suspect Palantir will see activity beyond anything anyone right now has predicted. 

Lets start by asking a question. If you had to create a company that was perfect in every way, that was untouchable by competition and greater than any company before it, one that would make google or amazon look like AMC by comparison, what would you need to do?

first it would need to be a monopoly. no question there right? but a monopoly of what? There are currently 2 options that fit best and are also realistically achievable. those to things are information and energy. both will always exist, they will always be in high demand, they will never go out of style, and whoever finds a way to gain absolute control over one or both will effectively become the most wealthy person ever. 100 thousand years from now when humanity has transcended existence and all material wants we will still need information and energy. Palantir is attempting to monopolize information and to better understand why this is such a big deal, lets see what it would take to monopolize energy. 

the first and surprisingly easiest step, would be to create a viable source of free or almost free energy that you would then sell, probably through monthly payments, to the entire world. miniature thorium reactors, or breakthroughs in fusion technology could potentially do this. There is more to be done however...

1. In order for your business to last for centuries, your device needs to be impossible to recreate by anybody except your business and those associated with it. 
2. it needs to be cheap, very cheap, and yet generate revenue regularly no matter the conditions or state of the world.
3. It needs to be constantly improved, or somehow protected from the possibility of someone creating an even better idea and putting your company out of business. 

assuming all these goals are met, you would now be the owner of a business that will always generate profit, that will always exist and bring value to customers, and that exists in a market that grows as humanity grows, meaning your potential is linked to the success and proliferation of humanity.  With no possible competition, you would be the creator of the most successful company to ever exist. 

How now,  could this be accomplished with information, and how far is Palantir from achieving these same goals? is their product impossible to recreate? is it cheap and consistent with revenue? Is it immune to any possibility of anyone catching up with something even better? 

Almost. not quite yet, but they are surprisingly close.

&#x200B;

1. can their product be recreated?

technically yes, but both Gotham and Foundry are seeing adoption by some very important organizations. Gotham is already joined at the hip with the United States government, and with continued proven effectiveness and Palantir's willingness to make deals with other countries, its pretty much guaranteed that Gotham will be seeing mass adoption into other countries as well. Like a really nice disease, eventually everyone aligned with the United States will use it. 

Foundry's the big fish here though. The real deal and the reason Palantir is on track with their goal of becoming the biggest software company in the world. That's not me saying that, they literally make that claim in their most recent earnings report. 

All businesses and people essentially have the same problem. Data is very valuable, probably one of the most inherently valuable things in existence. Don't believe me? take a look at your computer. data is just the transfer of information and a computer is simply a really big bundle of information and tricks to measure that information.  A whole bunch of transistors turn on and off and through a massive amount of clever engineering and abstraction, all that data of whether or not something's on or off, 1 or 0, gets turned into your afternoon midget porn.  this is an extreme example of how much value can be pulled from data no matter  how  unimportant or useless it may seem. 100 years ago nobody would have ever guessed that stringing a bunch of lights together and having them interact through rules determined by whether they are on or off would possibly lead to what we have today but here we are. 

Data has value. The problem that every business has is that they have all this data, but how exactly do you extract value from that? how do you extract the most value possible? everyone has their own solutions to these problems, but there is no unification to any of it. This is where Foundry comes in.

Data that the Country or Business or person owns gets fed into Foundry, and everyone using it can assign specific rules to this data. This is a drastic oversimplification, but you frankly don't need to know the gritty details because they don't really matter here.  All you need to know is that  this oversimplification applies to computers as well. Computers are a massive collection of data, governed by rules where the result and potential uses are completely controlled by the person using the computer. 

There are plenty of questions here, how it works exactly, how private it is, what the use cases look like, and you can do this research on your own. What's interesting here is that while this product can definitely be recreated, its much much harder then it sounds and the fact that IBM and AWS have already given up and simply partnered with Palantir rather than try and recreate this technology just goes to show just how hard it would be to make a better Foundry or Gotham.  However, assuming that everyone eventually starts using this tech, what would happen if something better came along? 

2. Is Palantir's product immune to new and disruptive competition? 

The answer here is yes and absolutely. the REALLY neat thing about Foundry is that it essentially creates a perpetually self improving system. People input data and assign rules, but that data never disappears and those rules never change or are forgotten unless overruled by other more complex rules. this means that ANY new data added to the system is used to further improve the system.  Again if you  want more details do the research because I'm trying to talk to children here. 

I've been talking about data a lot but I feel I should stress the fact that your idea of what data is or can be is likely underdeveloped. did you poo today? what color was it? how soft was it?  was it chunkey or smooth?  how long were you on the toilet?  can any of this info be used to determine what you ate? how healthy you are?  what time did you poo?  do you poo in cycles or does it come randomly? can any of this information help predict when you will poo again?  maybe knowing these things can help you poo even better and more comfortably? 

This is all Data.  All of it can be used, and all of it has value to be found.  everything you see, do, feel, and think is data.  The number of ways this data can be connected and utilized to better understand the world and yourself is potentially infinite.  Therefore, a company that is able to create a product that can monopolize this potential could possibly grow even larger then one based on energy.  a product that is perpetually self improving will never be outpaced by anything else ESPECUALLY if they get a head start which is exactly what Palantir has spent 17 years and billions of dollars of R&D on. 

3. Is Palantir's product cheap and guaranteed to be profitably no matter the state of the world? 

I think it goes without saying that Software is the best business to be successful in. This is Unfortunately where Palantir is at their weakest currently, but as stated in their earnings report, they are hell bent on focusing on growth over everything else.  First they bag huge companies with lotsa money, then medium ones, then small businesses, and finally everyday average people.  Assuming company's continue to sign contracts, there will one day be a turning point where Palantir goes from a WSB name to a household one.  you wont even notice it happen, it will just happen. As for profitability regardless of the state of the world, Covid has already proven that Palantir's services are in very high demand. 

&#x200B;

On top of ALL this, Palantir is exclusively aligned with United States interests. Imagine if every country in the world used Palantir to some extent, and all that added value and power was exclusively controlled by the United States. There is an even bigger discussion to be had on the current technological race between the USA and China over who will perfect AI first, and the role Palantir will play in all this. The conclusion here is that whoever does win in the end, they will essentially decide the direction the world takes and how people in that world will live. This situation is very similar to the race between the U.S and Germany over who could invent the atomic bomb. luckily for us there's a lot less hot fiery death and a lot more new world order overshadowing the old one through the always watchful eyes of artificial intelligence. Elon musk is damn right to be afraid of AI, and If I had to pick one country to take it all I would like it to be the USA. This means that investing in Palantir is almost like betting on the United states in this all for one game. Make no mistake there is a very very good chance that whether or not you care about Palantir, your life is going to be affected by them one way or another. 

The moral of the story is buy the fucking dip and don't be a pussy about it. when you believe in a company enough it doesn't matter how much it dips because unless Karp and friends die in a fireball of death after boarding a small private jet to their mansions in Hawaii for a night of  drug fueled indulgences, the future will always be bright. If you're unsure about Palantir still don't worry.  They aren't going anywhere and there will be many many many more catalysts to fomo into and lose 50% of your portfolio on.

Since I don't understand how it can be done I'm inclined to believe it's not as useful as it claims to be, unless any Palantir engineers can explain it better or someone can chime in better what it actually does."

As an enterprise software company, it's really concerning that they can't turn a profit after all these years.

Software companies should generally have high profit margins because the marginal cost is near zero. Unless their services component is large, which is costly, or have other systemic problems. Their product is not magical and it requires a heavy handed sales component. That's why partnering with IBM makes sense for them. IBM has a special type of sales force for this kind of products and services. 

I have no doubt they will do better, but to have an insane valuation requires a solid path to profitability in the mass market."

2021-05-14 11:46:29,wallstreetbets,No they dont. Companys like to imply this but nobody actually says this unless they want the SEC up their ass for misleading investers. Palantir has their balls in their throat here and I respect that.

2021-05-14 12:31:20,wallstreetbets,"The problem is if they keep up the insanely large stock compensation packages, the value of the company rises, the company makes billions, but the shares never increase in value"
2021-05-14 16:19:32,wallstreetbets,"If you really have a data science career, you understand that Palantir is a hype scam, right?

They are a good, valuable, solid company in some ways, but they just aren't what they claim to be (or what people seem to think they are publicly).

&#x200B;

The reason for their ""extreme integration"" is that they pay teams of data scientists to spend a ton of human hours tearing apart all of the systems of a client and then integrating them. The bit of ""ai"" is just gloss at the end.  


That's fine. They're basically a digital construction company. They build awesome skyscrapers for clients who they bill a lot of money per project.

&#x200B;

BUT, publicly they have everyone believing that they has some magical ""AI software"" that they deploy that simply magically analyzes all of a client's systems and ""radically integrates"" them in a cheap, scalable manner.

If their claims were true, then indeed, Palantir would be a $10 trillion company, no problem.

&#x200B;

But  their REAL business is almost the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of scalable and cheap because they have to 1) draw on the most limited labor pool in the world i.e. data scientists, 2) only hire the best of the best of them, and 3) pay those teams way above market rates to work for them (and they tend to massage this with huge stock awards to the teams).

&#x200B;

Is it a viable, profitable business in the end? Sure.

&#x200B;

Is it a limitless scalable master AI that freely lets them cash multi-million dollar project checks almost for free? No.

&#x200B;

What is another business where this happened recently: WeWork.

&#x200B;

Reporters would ask: ""So you make money by buying leases and subdividing them?"" and then founder/CEO Neumann would publicly always say, ""No, we're a scalable tech company!!!! We are changing work culture and living culture via proprietary technology!!!!""

&#x200B;

And they ballooned up to a $47 billion valuation before people finally realized the truth: they actually were just leasing property and subdividing leases.  


The same thing is happening with Palantir."
2021-05-14 02:01:27,wallstreetbets,"That's just sounds like a lot of buzzwords, not trying to roast your explanation but even the airbus article is buzzwordy. I don't know what it means to have data talking together, maybe you can have an aggregated view of many data pipelines? Uses AI to determine the best decision? So the basis of most real world AI is supervised learning. How can the software know the best decision for a scenario without training for it and also can you even train on something so random, you can't generalize decision making for any situation. The hot AI  rn is Machine learning specifically deep learning and it works well for a specialized task or prediction when you have lots of data covering a lot of cases with labeled predictions. ML sucks at generalized solutions so I'm really curious what their ai is actually doing?"

2021-05-14 01:08:57,wallstreetbets,The employees are only there because of the stock options. Palantir pays significantly less in salary than FAANG companies their employees would otherwise work at.
2021-05-14 00:12:34,wallstreetbets,"Good points. The company does have future, but the stock price future is not clear. I'm not too familiar with the reasons for paying so much to employees, other than for retention of irreplaceable/rare skills. In any case, that sounds like an expensive R&D cost. On the other hand, if all the profit goes back to employees is a good thing for themselves but not for investors. We'll see."
2021-05-13 21:49:18,wallstreetbets,That would be more appropriate
2021-05-14 00:02:19,wallstreetbets,Preach!!
2021-05-14 01:32:44,wallstreetbets,"Palantir offers a tool, Gotham, that ICE uses to carry out their orders.  I’m sure ICE has used, and still uses, Microsoft products to track immigrants, but no one blames Bill Gates for immigration raids.  The reason people are blaming Palantir for all of the raids that happened is that they provided a much better tool to help those raids than the previous methods offered.  Blame the president, blame the leaders of ICE, but don’t blame the tool they used to track people.

And I have a lot of libertarian molecules in my body"
2021-05-14 01:28:05,wallstreetbets,"The guardian? Blah how biased and unreliable. Not to mention if Palantir doesn’t help the U.S gain ai dominance than China will be our rulers and you will like your new rulers even less.

Also I see nothing wrong with using palantir to enforce the border. The border is worse now for kids, America and definitely the border towns."
2021-05-14 11:29:42,wallstreetbets,"I disagree with your sentiment, but beyond that I think you are focusing to much on a very small an ineffectual area of focus. Ice used palantir for raids yes, and maybe that is immoral, but these things happened because of rules created by elected officials. Eventually new officials are elected and those rules change as they already have. Palantir is not aligned with the government of the past but the present. They will continue to be used by the government for whatever they want and if the people dont like it we have established systems protected by the constitution to fight these things. Palantir is not emotionally aligned with anything but the constitution and the responsibility of servicing the government in their contractual obligations and to emotionally align yourself against them is to miss the point entirely."
2021-05-14 11:50:50,wallstreetbets,"Nope. I was wrong, looking at it closer now I get it. Shorty 3 month history I guess. Seems like a solid LTH."
2021-05-14 13:47:33,wallstreetbets,"I was born to live fast and die young, old man. I can't sit around for decades until my money does something, I need it now so that I can spend it on cool shit, like alcohol and women. You know, stuff that matters."
2021-05-14 17:23:48,wallstreetbets,"This is my worry. They’ve said they’ll bring it under control, but when?"
2021-05-14 02:16:31,wallstreetbets,"When it comes down to it no one seems to be able to explain what their software actually does. I'm pretty convinced its a glorified BI dashboarding tool because I just can't wrap my mind around how Foundry and Gotham can magically join disparate data sources together and make insights happen. Anyone who has ever worked with big data knows almost all the work is in loading/preparing/cleaning data, which is incredibly manual because it's not something AI can easily figure out. Data doesn't magically 'talk' to each other without a lot of human input and I doubt Palantir has solved that aspect."
2021-05-13 23:33:34,wallstreetbets,If you can’t read an informative post then maybe buying FDs aren’t in your best interest
2021-05-14 00:27:51,wallstreetbets,You are correct sir. Karp has stated several times that they plan to continue this into the future. No end date. They believe giving their employees these options will incentive the employees to grow with the company...not sure of another model similar so will have to look into it. I think you hit on it though. Retention is very important for them.
2021-05-14 12:14:33,wallstreetbets,"I'm a huge believer in putting your customers and employees wellbeing over your investers. The nature of investing means that downturns are expected and investors can afford to wait for as long as they believe. However your customers and employees are the ones solely responsible for your success, not your investers. Investers just give opportunity but it's up to the employees to make things happen and the customers to approve of the service you provide."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,The best time to buy is when others panic. 25k share yolo on $PLTR. 
2021-05-13 21:37:12,wallstreetbets,"To be frank, the continued downward movement of PLTR is a symptom of general market bearishness rather than an indictment of the company itself. The only true strike mark against them is with regards to stock based compensation maturing in this time frame, which means that they are in a period of dilution. That said, a multitude of government contracts which are growing in value and number, rapid expansion into the private sector, and one deep ass moat around their technology means that this company isnt going anywhere for the foreseeable future, and actually should be increasing in value far faster than the rate of dilution. Recent earnings were bullish as hell, with all goals met or beat, and 30% YoY guidance reaffirmed. 

In short, my estimation is that the bearish market right now is a blessing in disguise, as I expect this stock to slingshot upwards in value when market conditions permit. From there, I believe it will stabilize at a significantly higher price per share. At that point, long term high returns will most likely continue unless or until guidance is revised to a lower level.

I dont write much DD, I'm just good at analyzing and drawing conclusions from it. Check out other posts and the recent earnings call if you want the hard numbers I'm getting this from."
2021-05-13 23:47:49,wallstreetbets,"Don’t listen to the haters. I am with you 100%. PLTR may be a short-term loser, but it will be a 4-5 bagger in the coming years. Check out the Seeking Alpha DD on it if you haven’t done so already. PLTR is an investment, not a trade. If anything, buy the dip to average down. Retail traders have gotten so accustomed to quick money because of how easy it was to gain after March 2020. They’ve either forgotten or don’t know what long-term investing looks like. Hold strong, it will pay off."
2021-05-13 21:28:37,wallstreetbets,"Im with you dawg, except im down 30% 💩"

2021-05-13 22:05:42,wallstreetbets,yep. i was about to stop buying shares before earnings. then i read over the earnings when i woke up that day. right back to stashing money into palantir dips with zero doubt. 😂

2021-05-13 21:44:54,wallstreetbets,"Very. This feels to me like Gamestop did when it was hovering around $20. That said, I dont get the same sense of massively impending price action so much as that its due for a strong price rediscovery as more institutions buy in and the market works through sector rotation."

2021-05-13 23:19:49,wallstreetbets,"Here is a pro tip, you should never buy high. When you are down money, and you believe in the stock and you do your DD, the stock is essentially at a discounted price and you should buy more. If it continues going down you should buy more again.

2021-05-13 22:38:39,wallstreetbets,"The number as of december 31st 2020 was that outstanding options could account for up to 34% dilution if all exercised. That should be quite a bit lower now after this quarter, and dilution going forward was estimated to run at about 4% annually IIRC. Compared with projected 30% growth, and a revenue beat this quarter of 49%, and you can see why I believe concerns over it to be pretty overblown.

I'm also expecting the SBC heavy model to taper off now that they are entering profitability, and can rely on salary based compensation more than in the past."
2021-05-13 21:48:52,wallstreetbets,"Eh, only if I was worried about being assigned. They've already paid for themselves since I tend to just roll when they come up on a month out and arent even close to tapping out available margin.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry BB Ivy's customer base revealed CIBC interview [click here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nyuz5eys7mwed4y/BlackBerry.mp4?dl=0)

Listen at time 26 minute

""With Ivy we launched in December, we began working on it well advanced of that, we began working with OEMs, Tier1s, and THE ECOSYSTEM in advanced of that.....so right now we're executing to the plan and we're delivering early access""

This means blackberry already has signed up OEMs and Tier1 to deploy Ivy and start monetizing. They are keeping the OEM and TIER1 SECRET for competitive and strategy reasons. T

i personally believe that with patent sale and Ivy ecosystem(OEM, TIER1) announcement the stock has huge potential. Remember, institutions own 50% of the share and only 250M remains in retail hands. 53M short. This will be bigger than January WSB event."
2021-05-13 21:27:13,wallstreetbets,Soooo 6$ BB calls?
2021-05-13 22:10:13,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, both will be fantastic potential! To add to that though go back and really listen to the QNX description. The CIBC guy is doing mental math on total installed cars, their past profit to try to project future revenues. 

He mentions TAM (Total Addressable Market), and ASP (Average Selling Price). 

What people aren't getting is QNX is one price, QNX Hypervisor is another price, and the Domain Controller is another (my best guess being a computer guy). 

So the next 175 Million cars sold with QNX will not yield 200 million (current profit). The next 175 million cars are looking at many multiples of licenses per car, and higher $ values for the premium licenses for Domain controllers and hypervisors. 

If the license count per car goes up 4 X , and some of the licenses are the premium licenses what does that do to the ASP/car and TAM calculation.

I think we are conservatively looking at a 2 x TAM, and 2 x ASP for QNX alone! \~ 800 million

Don't even get me started on IVY, or Security......."

&#x200B;

* **The stock price of Express, Inc. (NYSE: EXPR) increased by over 10% during intraday trading. This is why it happened.**

The stock price of Express, Inc. (NYSE: EXPR) increased by  over 10% during intraday trading. There was no direct news from the  company today so it appears that there are external factors in play.

 It appears [that the increase of AMC today](https://pulse2.com/amc-entertainment-nyse-amc-stock-over-25-increase-explanation/)  triggered a “meme” stock frenzy today by retail investors. Express is  part of a group of stocks that were short-squeezed in late January by  the r/WallStreetBets community on Reddit. So when the stock price of a  company in that group increases, the others also tend to increase as  well.

2021-05-14 09:14:36,wallstreetbets,"The potential in the pipeline is a gold mine.  I have been accumulating this stock since 2018 and the cancer & pain management portfolios are impressive, not to mention the technology they have developed with the Mayo Clinic, Columbia and major holdings with other biotech future partners like Cellularity, Immunity Bio, etc... just take a deep look.  The shorts have been beating the SP down for years and it’s just a matter of time before Revenues come in.  Predicting this will be a $100 stock in 18mos and $200 in 3 years.  I like the stock but I’m not a financial advisor.  I build high performance custom homes for a living."
2021-05-14 16:55:36,wallstreetbets,This company was teasing investors 10 years ago. “..exciting technologies in the pipeline..” I think it would be prudent to wait. Let them prove their stuff is marketable. If they do get a blockbuster then buy the shares. Putting money to work now is risky.

2021-05-14 00:57:46,wallstreetbets,100% - the bearish sentiment seems to be dominating so I assume the rest of this month will be flat. I agree that it is an overreaction because I was watching it rally to $242 when the fine was announced over a month ago and I started buying calls following a dip from that level lol. How was this not priced in!?

If I invest $50,000 after it crashes, it's a very safe investment because it can't go down much more, only up.

I'm also swing trading currently although on a smaller scale to make some profit. I wouldn't hold long term right now though."

The fact is the feds low rate simi that never went away after 08 and the helicopter money that has made investors out of everyone has meant all sorts of companies can exist as zombies - see BA as an example.  These are terribly run companies that will only service their debts and avoid bankruptcy thru inflation.  They do have have large market share currently and produce things that will be bought anyway even at high prices.  

Long term though it’s a bad allocation of capital that will impair growth. The economy won’t tank if inflation persists but in real terms we will get poorer and it will become increasingly hard to find investments that offer real returns"

Residential real estate is probably stupidly overpriced right now in the burbs and will see some pull back.  There will be counter forces on that like rental properties being attractive to buyers again which have not been because of the inability to evict bad tenants. 

Right now I’d look at raw land too, nobody is buying because construction is impossible but that means some of these 2 and 5 acre lots in the immediate exurbs are likely bargains.  If I had a spare million I’d pick up 3 or 4 of them"
2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BMBL Bum Bull DD **Fast facts**

* Weak/cautious Q2 2021 guidance drove the stock down to almost half of ATH
* Shares are now below IPO price, at ATL
* Share lockup period expires 8/10/2021
* $MTCH now has an >8x greater valuation than $BMBL

**Bull Case**

* Online dating has displaced other ways of meeting in the US. That trend is likely to continue, growing the size of the pie for online dating companies. This trend is likely to be reproduced internationally, giving $BMBL an opportunity to acquire startups that succeed in emerging markets and protecting the company from one app going out of vogue. Match has survived doing the same thing.

Thomas, and Sonia Hausen. 2019. “Disintermediating your Friends: How online dating in the United States displaces other ways of meeting.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 116:17753–17758. https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/116\/36\/17753 ](https://preview.redd.it/414vzk8vwyy61.png?width=410&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3ea8ddadeb0b21ba141f33eb664518fb614956c)

&#x200B;

* Women are more likely to perceive the pandemic as serious and comply with lockdowns ([https://voxeu.org/article/gender-differences-covid-19-perception-and-compliance](https://voxeu.org/article/gender-differences-covid-19-perception-and-compliance)), suggesting there may be suppression in online dating participation from women. $MTCH monetizes men while $BMBL monetizes women, so we could see stronger numbers than $BMBL expects as lockdown orders evaporate in the major cities. 
* Analyst targets imply a 50% upside as a ""Roaring 20s"" re-opening play. 
* Inflation numbers listed yesterday were heavily driven by used car sales, suggesting the broader tech sell off could be misguided.

&#x200B;

**Bear Case**

* Inflation lowers the value of recurring revenue technology companies. Since the app broadly targets consumers, it likely can't easily raise prices without losing paying users. Our perception of revenue multipliers for software companies could be completely wrong in this new era.
* Some women report that Bumble attracts men that prefer women chase them. It's unclear how this might affect Bumble's low term growth potential versus Match companies that favor a traditional dating strategy. 
* Very large percentage of the float available to short. The new low market cap may attract short sellers with a quick 20-40% upside.

I've probably paid for like 300 superswipes totaling around a grand in that time frame and received 1/10 the matches I do on Tinder and I only pay tinder $10-20/month and I've been using them for a decade. Lol.  

The only accurate statement you made is that $bmbl incentivizes monetization through women as opposed to through men, which if you think about it, is logically stupid bc men will always be down to pay more for the chance at getting laid.  Bmbl is going against the tide and cultural norms. Women who pay on these types of apps are desperate or slutty.  Not to mention most women, will just swipe which is free. 


I made about $160 back from a class action I just filled out against $bmbl bc they suck so much.  Getting anything over $7 from a class action is like big time they fucked up.  

Their algo is completely backwards.

Can that not be controlled by those who practically ’run the world’? 

I believe they are purposely increasing prices and doing it at a rapid rate as compared to the past or through natural economic growth.  Could the reason for all of this be over population? I know that having kids has been of the factors decreasing due to higher prices. Bearing a child could at one point in the future be what only the wealthy could do/afford. Of course this may sound ridiculous to some.  but if we look at China and it’s income inequality those who are of the poorer spectrum, are having less kids.

there is no grand shadowy conspiracy manipulating events from behind the scenes. people cant even do their daily routine without fucking up and alienating those around them

Deff not about overpopulation though"
2021-05-13 20:25:14,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is a tool the 1% use to siphon liquidity from the world. 

Inflated prices do not affect them,  they are the ones setting those prices. 

FACT"
2021-05-13 20:13:36,wallstreetbets,"Over population isn’t a thing. That’s what the smart people say, so just relax and let out overlords make it impossible to buy the lumber for a jungle gym from your Wendy’s minimum wage."
2021-05-13 20:35:38,wallstreetbets,"Inflation can be though as a lag throughout a supply chain, based on wants and needs. It's obvious when you look at farming and seasonal supply chains.  In the end, everything will go up a bit at sometime, and we call this visible difference ""inflation"".  When money itself is scarce (i.e credit demand in 70s and 80s for boomer mortgages) it is a highly sought commodity on its own and the cost of the money feeds into inflation itself.  We are also at an historic time when death tolls from infant mortality, maternal mortality, and wars have decreased significantly.  Thus, the rise of other businesses such as tech, gaming, and service industries."
2021-05-13 20:10:31,wallstreetbets,As someone who is routinely high.....you might need to lay off the greens for a bit lol
2021-05-13 20:00:30,wallstreetbets,"It’s a good point, I think there are a collective of corporations that all price compete for the same raw materials, which would drive the price up based on supply. I also think the logistical constrains from COVID-19 maybe in play but overall the only way inflation as a fundamental principle makes sense is if it impacts all industries/commodities in a semi-equal manner… But this  never seems to pan out."

2021-05-13 21:00:33,wallstreetbets,Uh got a question what if i got negative dollars? Does it mean i owe money or do the central banks just print more money?
2021-05-13 21:05:39,wallstreetbets,"Wow how high are you?

Edit: I commented before I finished reading because I was like wtf this guy has to be high, then I finished reading."
2021-05-13 21:18:01,wallstreetbets,It’s all rigged. When the feds wanna bring in more money they inflate everything. Including taxes.

2021-05-13 21:24:55,wallstreetbets,Def high
2021-05-13 22:38:46,wallstreetbets,"The fed and government need inflation to help pay off the enormous debt we have.  The trick is to do it and keep the tbills rate low.  Think about it this way.  If you doubled the cost of everything including your taxes and pay, the 20 trillion in debt stays the same.  I am not at all optimistic that our debt can be controlled though.  But that is the Fed's game plan."
2021-05-13 23:55:26,wallstreetbets,Poor people have more kids.... maybe the plan is to stop population a collapse by keeping us poor.
2021-05-14 00:41:46,wallstreetbets,The USD doesn’t have any intrinsic value anyway.
2021-05-14 01:28:27,wallstreetbets,"Nah it’s pretty simple really. We’ve got dumb ass politicians that understand economics as much as I understand quantum mechanics. The faster we stop paying people to not produce, the faster inflation goes down."
2021-05-14 03:29:14,wallstreetbets,"Am I the only in here? They’re printing money on purpose to devaluate the dollar. People forgot about the debt? Hyperinflation won’t happen lol. Inflation will though, but trust me there aint nothing an interest rate can’t fix. They will time it right. They know what they’re doing."
2021-05-14 04:24:17,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a Wendy’s
2021-05-14 09:56:15,wallstreetbets,"To fabricate inflation data, they just need to hoard more wealth. If the government prints 5 trillion dollars, and 4.5 trillion goes into the pockets of people who never spend it, the economy at large probably won't see prices bid up. However, $5 trillion in the hands of people shouting ""WEN LAMBO"" will see a burger bid up to $50 real quick. Money in hands of poor and wealth equality = inflation with this number of greenbacks floating around imho"
2021-05-13 22:25:55,wallstreetbets,If you want it to change you have to kill the rich but sense no one will do that assume you're position over the barrel and take it in the ass like good little sheep

etc.

Fixed that for ya."
2021-05-14 12:55:52,wallstreetbets,The only thing that causes Inflation is mass fear of inflation. If we all agree there is no inflation then there is no inflation.
2021-05-14 13:03:36,wallstreetbets,"I wondered if they are letting inflation run for a bit to counteract the $15 minimum wage movement that's been going on. Before too long that wage hike won't matter, and they won't know what hit them."

Inflation is an issue but it ain't about depopulation especially as a higher population is better for those that own shit rather than those that don't."

2021-05-13 22:25:13,wallstreetbets,I think it's more along the lines of very little to gain and lots to lose for Nasa on that front. Their budget is only 1/35th of the military budget. Why spend that money to get to a desolate rock to jump around a bit? Also if they end up dying on re entry you've got a PR disaster because you sent a couple people there just to jump around a bit then they died. $25 billion doesn't really get you a lot each year.

Your theory on only the rich being able to afford having children made me think that if you are correct, then not only will they have all the children but they will have only the best children due to the level genetic modifiation that will be possible in the not too distant future that of course only they can afford.

Yes, $56. Not $560, not $420, not even $100, the underlying value of TSLA is $56 per share. That's ASSUMING they grow as much as they claim they will next year. If we took their current P/E, and adjusted it to 25, the appropriate value per share would be $17.50. They are the most overvalued stock on the S&P500, they're almost Enron tier.

Just buy puts, it's free money, every institutional investor knows it, hype can keep a stonk that high forever."

And the discounted cash flow model doesn’t even take into account the sharp increase in competition (right now Tesla is basically an EV monopoly) from all the other auto makers, plus the loss of al the cash from selling those environmentally friendly credits.

Definitely wouldn’t bet on TSLA right now."

2021-05-14 04:43:49,wallstreetbets,I got a hot tip that your mum went all in on GME
2021-05-14 05:06:22,wallstreetbets,"It'll start going up now, no worries!

Make Tesla Great Again"
2021-05-14 05:41:15,wallstreetbets,"I haven't seen many people talking about this small detail from Tesla last earnings report :

'Tesla Semi deliveries will also begin in 2021'  next week the news will come and you will win !"
2021-05-14 05:59:20,wallstreetbets,Buy when others are afraid. :D
2021-05-14 06:02:07,wallstreetbets,You still have time bro. Keep the faith!
2021-05-14 06:37:35,wallstreetbets,What's your strike price? You might be able to exercise some contracts if your strike price is lower than the current price.
2021-05-14 06:50:50,wallstreetbets,Solid research
2021-05-14 07:02:07,wallstreetbets,Stop using Robinhood you fucks
2021-05-14 07:08:46,wallstreetbets,still have time...TSLA very volatile.

2021-05-14 08:54:51,wallstreetbets,Just the tip.

Disclaimer: I barely even know what a stock is, I don't own any TSLA."
2021-05-14 09:53:28,wallstreetbets,Nicely done! You belong here :)
2021-05-14 10:22:37,wallstreetbets,Seems you got more than the tip.
2021-05-14 12:59:01,wallstreetbets,Rule #1 only do shares on meme stocks
2021-05-14 15:35:42,wallstreetbets,That's a hell of a tip. Glad ya didn't share.  Don't want to know.
2021-05-14 15:54:01,wallstreetbets,"Eh, not quite sure that's how it works. A $500 stock can't ""rebound"", it's already extremely high priced."
2021-05-14 16:02:46,wallstreetbets,I did the opposite haha but I feel you. I was pretty red on Weds:
2021-05-14 16:52:14,wallstreetbets,Ohhh no
2021-05-14 18:13:15,wallstreetbets,Try selling vertical credit spreads instead of those debit buys and you might start making some money. They work even over a couple of days if you catch a trend.
2021-05-14 19:14:19,wallstreetbets,Poking your own fresh turds with your nose is not a “hot tip” you fabulous retard.
2021-05-14 19:22:24,wallstreetbets,Why not roll it out longer? Can you do that on RH?
2021-05-13 20:19:18,wallstreetbets,"#was the ""hot tip"" a herpes penis?"
2021-05-14 00:19:26,wallstreetbets,Apparently people trying to motivate others to sell tsla has been a reoccurring theme today. Watch out for these guys. They super sus
2021-05-14 13:53:07,wallstreetbets,That was a bad trade
2021-05-14 15:52:24,wallstreetbets,Are you serious? 100 difference in such choppy market? When the contracts expire? We been calling TSLA short/puts since 680.
2021-05-14 13:15:40,wallstreetbets,Please post the next time you act on TSLA so I can do the opposite.
2021-05-14 06:35:45,wallstreetbets,Whats TVPRWPF
2021-05-13 21:06:57,wallstreetbets,And he was laughing a you walked away.
2021-05-13 20:07:03,wallstreetbets,This sound like a hot tip
2021-05-14 09:04:36,wallstreetbets,Up $14 premarket already lol
2021-05-13 21:04:45,wallstreetbets,"It might go up tomorrow but it's big crash is coming. How many AMC, GME OR TLRY  could you buy with your Tesla funds."
2021-05-14 09:15:11,wallstreetbets,Guess I was write lmao it did hope y’all listened
2021-05-14 17:30:55,wallstreetbets,"It’s true, but you may not be right until AFTER your puts expire. I thought long and hard about 300P 6-12 months out just to rub it in the face of all the Sheep on Elon’s dick. Decided against it."
2021-05-13 20:59:45,wallstreetbets,Well done you have sold before the crash. You can invest elsewhere good look.
2021-05-13 23:25:49,wallstreetbets,"This has both saved me and fucked me on short term calls. 

OP... maybe flip a coin? Heads you dip out, tails you double down?  This has also both saved me and fucked me. Lol"
2021-05-14 00:25:19,wallstreetbets,No it’s 695 strike - $5 less retarded than the 700 strike.
2021-05-13 20:30:54,wallstreetbets,You mean on the guy who gave him the hot tip?

2021-05-13 20:23:02,wallstreetbets,I love how delightfully early-pandemic this is.
2021-05-14 07:04:43,wallstreetbets,Pretty much basically just the hottest ticker on the market
2021-05-14 16:44:55,wallstreetbets,I'm a pretty big fan of OFWGKTA myself.
2021-05-13 20:44:26,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-05-13 23:27:40,wallstreetbets,Who would buy Tlry???
2021-05-14 00:32:38,wallstreetbets,At least it’s not 5/14 expiration. Still have a chance
2021-05-14 01:12:14,wallstreetbets,I’m not arguing that there’s just been a lot of posts encouraging panic selling lately 😂
2021-05-14 01:10:10,wallstreetbets,You’re sus
2021-05-14 01:10:18,wallstreetbets,Super duper sus
2021-05-13 22:16:21,wallstreetbets,Better times... though I do have more money now. Lol
2021-05-14 08:07:05,wallstreetbets,"You know, if i had found that i would have thrown money at it. And that worries me"
2021-05-14 07:07:15,wallstreetbets,Ah ok 👍
2021-05-14 01:13:33,wallstreetbets,Tesla isnt going to 0 but there is definitely more room to fall and I'm not trying to catch that knife

Instead of buying options on hype and staying in them long, am gonna buy options on trend and stay in them for about 15 seconds and whatever I get is what I get. Win or loss. Just get about 30 of them and see what happens. Had I done that with CLOV Id be up $2000. Am instead now down $4000..."
2021-05-14 01:14:57,wallstreetbets,How do u know it won’t rise? U wouldn’t happen to be psychic right? 😂🦆
2021-05-14 01:15:39,wallstreetbets,What happened why are people panic selling it?
2021-05-14 01:25:48,wallstreetbets,U know I’m not really a fan of China but they are pretty smart. Even so I really believe a company can do truly well even without entering the Chinese market.
2021-05-14 15:31:06,wallstreetbets,This is my strategy as a noob. And it has worked out well this week. I put a put on Wish yesterday and they went down 29%. Thought AMC would dip and getting fooked. (Over my daily limit on trades)Closing bell can’t come soon enough
2021-05-14 01:17:13,wallstreetbets,https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/05/13/business/tesla-china-sales-decline/index.html
2021-05-14 01:32:34,wallstreetbets,"This isnt gonna kill Tesla for good but they would have been better off just exporting cars from the USA or doing knock down kits and assembling them there as cheaply as possible. I think they tried to expand in asia before they had a natural market to support a ""gigafactory."" The sales numbers they are putting up are pitiful considering china has a booming economy and a population of 1b. If tesla are lucky they can unload those cars elsewhere but they already have a factory in Europe soooo... gonna be a fun time with logistics."
2021-05-14 01:17:37,wallstreetbets,They tried to expand into china and the cars basically arent selling
2021-05-14 01:18:36,wallstreetbets,That’s it? 😂
2021-05-14 01:19:58,wallstreetbets,Well I still believe in it but I guess it’s everyone’s personal call on it I’m not sure China is a big decider on things but hey I guess to each his own...
2021-05-14 01:20:19,wallstreetbets,Anyway thank you for the info
2021-05-14 01:21:54,wallstreetbets,Btw CNN? Really do they even have any credibility left 😂
2021-05-14 01:30:31,wallstreetbets,To be quite frank I dnt understand why Elon would want to do business with a country that commits genocide on its own people he should pull out forget China. Their products are really cheap anyway remember 99 cent store toys 😂 yea china
2021-05-14 01:34:13,wallstreetbets,Ooh no cheap no good cutting corners no good take it from me I bought a closet from Amazon that was made in China. Bro like at 4 am the whole thing falls apart on my floor 😂. I woke up terrified I thought I was going to die 😂😂😂
2021-05-14 01:22:08,wallstreetbets,"They opened a factory in china solely so they could sell cars in Asia and they havent even made much of a dent in the EV market over there. Tbh I'm not really surprised, the chinese are known for not being big on buying foreign goods, even if they're made in china"
2021-05-14 01:22:39,wallstreetbets,No news outlet does.
2021-05-14 01:34:57,wallstreetbets,Speaking of toys you can get a Chinese ev that might as well be a life size toy car lol. Hardly bigger than a golf cart but seats 4
2021-05-14 01:33:54,wallstreetbets,"I imagine he saw it as a huge untapped market, like anyone who has no idea who they are trying to sell to 😂"
2021-05-14 01:35:25,wallstreetbets,Lmao
2021-05-14 01:23:10,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-05-14 01:37:45,wallstreetbets,I think China is going to take Elon’s idea and produce their own cheaper electric cars that fall apart at 4am😂
2021-05-14 01:39:49,wallstreetbets,"They probably already are haha.

You know what's even funnier? A chinese built Tesla probably isnt any worse than an american built Tesla. Their quality control is so fucking bad it makes Chrysler look normal."

2021-05-13 23:07:04,wallstreetbets,Is it too late to buy amc? I have 460$ and want to know if I should dump it all in.
2021-05-13 22:56:04,wallstreetbets,"Exercise as many of the calls as possible tomorrow and let's short squeeze the crap out of this lol. Options settle wednesday morning, like we saw on jan 22nd, so if enough people exercise their calls tomorrow it will get SUPER NUTTY next week.

I'm more than willing to take this bad boy to $500 per share. If we all load up on zero day calls with 25% chance to expire in the money like 2 hours before close, and then spike it into close AND EXERCISE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE CALLS, that will create a massive shortage of shares next week. Market makers typically only hedge like 10% of these getting exercised, and just imagine what happens when 90% get exercised... wire some cash in tomorrow same day"
2021-05-14 01:07:39,wallstreetbets,"Lol someone ask how he knew to pick the right time a bankruptcy overlevereged company would gamma ramp?

2021-05-14 12:21:21,wallstreetbets,"Wow! I am very impressed. I wish I did the call side this week. Puts are worthless however it drove the price of my stock Holdings 🎊🎉  I need a few of these opening my businesses.

Hopefully those puts will rebound before May 21st expiration"
2021-05-14 12:40:58,wallstreetbets,Look at this fucking retard

2021-05-14 14:25:10,wallstreetbets,what if you don't have the money for those calls?  would they just automatically be sold or would some get exercised and the rest would get sold based on the profits from the sale?  noob to options\*
2021-05-14 14:31:59,wallstreetbets,Only stock saving me right now!
2021-05-14 14:33:56,wallstreetbets,Oh that’s not a third leg.

2021-05-14 18:44:50,wallstreetbets,Great job jerk face....we hope you make even more major bank 🙄🤬
2021-05-13 22:34:15,wallstreetbets,"I don’t remember Deep fucking value ever talking about AMC. There’s only one ticket, and it’s GME. I hope you figure that out. Your fighting against the top 1% and most wealthy people to ever exist. They sent stupid. Anything BUT GME is a distraction.. congratulations on your gains, but that’s pennies in comparison to one share of GME when this moons"
2021-05-13 22:17:01,wallstreetbets,Holy shit wow I’m not even mad. Unless you don’t sell early tomorrow and they expire worthless.
2021-05-14 01:08:49,wallstreetbets,He sold. Duemp it.
2021-05-13 21:27:40,wallstreetbets,i hope you don’t get wrecked tom
2021-05-13 22:51:28,wallstreetbets,Green AMC?? Wow!
2021-05-13 23:59:11,wallstreetbets,I really need to figure out how to do options calls lol. My simple gains on growth don’t cut it
2021-05-14 00:54:18,wallstreetbets,"noob here: i haven't once bought/sold a call/put. what did OP do here?

did he buy a call with a lower strike price? help an ape out!"
2021-05-14 06:22:05,wallstreetbets,Major big clit energy
2021-05-13 20:43:47,wallstreetbets,You make an interesting point. I fear I have no choice but to agree.
2021-05-14 06:45:58,wallstreetbets,Lollll
2021-05-13 23:41:18,wallstreetbets,That was financial advice. Pay the man!
2021-05-13 20:59:27,wallstreetbets,I held. If I lose it all tomorrow I will just DECLARE BANKRUPTCY!
2021-05-14 04:15:43,wallstreetbets,before or after tax though?
2021-05-13 23:19:47,wallstreetbets,Whose money do you think I stole to make this dumb bet?
2021-05-13 20:13:55,wallstreetbets,You math good... But we still have tomorrow so will see if it pays off
2021-05-14 06:39:22,wallstreetbets,Practice on fake accounts. Save you money. And learn how they work... Then get lucky
2021-05-14 19:07:05,wallstreetbets,First ones free
2021-05-13 20:50:07,wallstreetbets,"Two weeks ago for the 28ths. Monday and Tuesday for the ones expiring tomorrow. 

Why?: 100 percent borrow utilization (no shares available to short) 

Friday, Monday and Tuesday 80 percent loan rate with 4 days to cover. So thought Thursday or Friday could pop in addition with Delta hedging. 

Knew their offering was about over so much less downward pressure and AMC has enough liquidity for the next 2 years ruling out bankruptcy (the reason it's so heavily shorted to begin with)"
2021-05-14 00:53:59,wallstreetbets,"Because the 10.5call printed Hella comparatively. Dumb ape make dumb money, smart ape get smart gets put down."
2021-05-14 06:38:19,wallstreetbets,In simple ape terms.... I bought the 9.5 calls when the stock price was around 9.20.. bought the 10.50 calls when the SP price was around 10.. cheaper otm calls print bigger.
2021-05-13 23:32:09,wallstreetbets,Which ones did you sell?
2021-05-14 02:28:41,wallstreetbets,I think it will back to $10 a share
2021-05-13 22:24:01,wallstreetbets,😂😂 it's a 50/50 for me either I get hurt or Melvin gets hurt.   Hope your odds are better.
2021-05-14 06:14:12,wallstreetbets,And that's why u didn't make 100K like OP :)
2021-05-14 19:07:29,wallstreetbets,Leverage
2021-05-13 22:48:21,wallstreetbets,What threads do you follow on Stocktwits? All the ones I’ve read everyone sounds literally retarded.
2021-05-14 03:18:11,wallstreetbets,"Pick up the phone when it goes green, green"
2021-05-14 06:33:37,wallstreetbets,2 weeks ago on half. Mon Tuesday and some in the am on the Friday expirations
2021-05-13 22:19:29,wallstreetbets,Look through comments
2021-05-13 23:18:19,wallstreetbets,The trick is to buy before they go up
2021-05-13 23:30:38,wallstreetbets,"Hell no, it's early still!

&#x200B;

\*fyi, I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice."
2021-05-13 23:14:45,wallstreetbets,"GME  
THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE"
2021-05-13 20:15:28,wallstreetbets,TD took off the sell button
2021-05-14 02:28:19,wallstreetbets,"I know right . i love how he actually wrote a long thought out response to the question also, as if it wasnt just total fucking luck that this share offering happened the day before his shit expired totally worthless.  saddest part is this will give so many retards hope that this will be them with their 17 amc shares"
2021-05-14 02:31:09,wallstreetbets,"yes, exactly this."
2021-05-14 02:24:25,wallstreetbets,Look at my post history. Give you a better idea
2021-05-14 02:35:44,wallstreetbets,TD
2021-05-14 08:47:08,wallstreetbets,Hold strong my dude
2021-05-13 23:52:55,wallstreetbets,"Imagine being dumb enough to think DFV is the only one capable of doing research on a stock. Seriously man do some of your own research because that comment makes you sound like a sheep, not an ape."
2021-05-13 20:14:48,wallstreetbets,I don't think he asked you too
2021-05-13 22:19:51,wallstreetbets,Why would you be mad?
2021-05-14 02:32:27,wallstreetbets,check out tastytrades on utube. he has some really good options tutorials. u arent going to get a real explination in any comment. its something that requires in depth explanations and seeing it visualized. also u never fully learn until u dive in and lose ur own money
2021-05-14 07:38:39,wallstreetbets,What if he sold the 13s to exercise the 9s
2021-05-13 22:05:43,wallstreetbets,He could sell some for capital
2021-05-13 23:32:50,wallstreetbets,You make an interesting conclusion. I fear I have no choice but to conclude the same.
2021-05-14 10:14:17,wallstreetbets,"Woah woah woah, no financial advice here. Only degenerates."
2021-05-13 22:49:43,wallstreetbets,"You do know that you can't JUST say that you declare bankruptcy though, right...?"
2021-05-14 02:09:36,wallstreetbets,You'll be fine. AMC hits $20 tomorrow.
2021-05-14 04:26:28,wallstreetbets,IRA

2021-05-13 21:01:16,wallstreetbets,You smart ape. Me no understand. Bananas plz?
2021-05-13 21:32:21,wallstreetbets,Big balls to put your whole portfolio on it bro - happy it worked out for you.
2021-05-13 23:59:35,wallstreetbets,"I don't remember seeing prices that cheap 2 weeks ago.  Congrats and Fuck you!

I have a bunch of Jan 23 leaps running from $2 to $35 Calls.  I got in back in December dirt cheap.  But no way would I drop that much on two weeks.  Great play!"
2021-05-13 22:30:27,wallstreetbets,i see de way
2021-05-14 07:47:33,wallstreetbets,Why are you saying 100 percent borrow utilization? There are gazzilions shares to borrow everywhere lol. More borrows = more squeeze potential.
2021-05-14 05:06:23,wallstreetbets,Price target next week?
2021-05-14 05:53:45,wallstreetbets,Good due diligence please cash out amc as a company is worth jack diddly
2021-05-14 04:36:33,wallstreetbets,"Not a put down, this dumb ape does not know why spreads are better."
2021-05-14 09:48:48,wallstreetbets,10.5c expiring today. It was looking like I picked a good price until it totally mooned.
2021-05-14 12:48:58,wallstreetbets,Maybe I made it elsewhere :P
2021-05-14 02:25:36,wallstreetbets,"pretty much anything that isnt amc or gme.  despite how bad and trolly stocktwits can be, it sure as hell beats this echo chamber of 2 stocks over and over and over and over. cant wait to see the next amc meme with some rocket ships. so funny and clever !"
2021-05-13 22:29:26,wallstreetbets,don't see any answer as to the date you bought
2021-05-13 23:19:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah but it says it was 3.25 today .. It was 10.24 when I bought in I think 🤔
2021-05-14 02:39:31,wallstreetbets,This
2021-05-13 23:15:31,wallstreetbets,?
2021-05-13 23:45:06,wallstreetbets,Tendie Dreams?
2021-05-14 01:15:39,wallstreetbets,"I can’t decide what took more steel balz, putting 47k on FDs or not selling after making over 100k in a day.  Hopefully tomorrow keeps what you made, nice job!"
2021-05-13 20:33:36,wallstreetbets,rip ur gains then
2021-05-13 21:15:56,wallstreetbets,For real?
2021-05-14 02:51:06,wallstreetbets,"So you state a price you think the actual share value will be at a certain date, and then you get to sell the share for that price even though you only paid like a fraction? And the guy who owns the share who called a put has to pay out?"
2021-05-13 22:22:55,wallstreetbets,SELL?????
2021-05-14 00:07:13,wallstreetbets,You make a conclusive point here. I have no choice but to show interest in your fear.
2021-05-14 07:36:00,wallstreetbets,Same conclusions to conclude with here.
2021-05-13 22:51:10,wallstreetbets,I declare bankruptcy on you!
2021-05-13 23:50:46,wallstreetbets,"He didn’t say it, he declared it."
2021-05-14 02:59:02,wallstreetbets,no? ;D
2021-05-14 02:23:44,wallstreetbets,That's what I was betting... It's volatile as ass stock.. could hit 11 before bouncing back up
2021-05-13 20:32:57,wallstreetbets,I’m retarded
2021-05-14 06:06:19,wallstreetbets,"I'm just throwing my feces against the wall bro. But if you look at the percentage change, it was the 10 that mooned, not the 9.. and that's just how options go went approaching expiry and the squeeze gets put on."
2021-05-14 13:06:41,wallstreetbets,Proof or ban LoL
2021-05-14 06:10:20,wallstreetbets,Your witty response tho? Pure af golden threads ... you got other stocks ripping up n down faster than your wife's boyfriends cock??
2021-05-13 23:28:15,wallstreetbets,That’s the price of the call dumb dumb
2021-05-13 23:21:47,wallstreetbets,You have enough for a few shares of some tasty GME
2021-05-14 06:29:23,wallstreetbets,It peaked 220k profit

2021-05-14 17:27:15,wallstreetbets,You sell the option to buy the shares!
2021-05-14 00:52:36,wallstreetbets,I concur
2021-05-14 10:23:19,wallstreetbets,Your point is appealing. I fear the choice that I have to agree.
2021-05-14 01:04:08,wallstreetbets,Bankruptcy! Bankruptcy on your whole family! Bankruptcy on you! Bankruptcy on your cow!
2021-05-14 07:47:04,wallstreetbets,My mistake! Carry on 🙌🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-13 20:54:53,wallstreetbets,Your actually closer I have a few more higher risk lower cost options under that didn't fit in the screen shot

2021-05-14 02:30:50,wallstreetbets,"not really , hes just being realistic. telling someone to sell isnt being a gay bear, its trying to make sure the dude secures some bag with only 1 day left . hed be a gay bear if he was bashing amc and calling it shit etc . u sound like a gaybear for not wanting him to take profits to be honest. maybe becuz ur the one who sold him the calls so in reality ur the gaybear."
2021-05-13 22:46:47,wallstreetbets,"Calm down guys, he spelt HOLD wrong"
2021-05-14 02:07:50,wallstreetbets,Agreed
2021-05-14 14:44:55,wallstreetbets,Interesting but I’m going to have to disagree.

2021-05-14 02:33:56,wallstreetbets,I was just referring to the dudes comment history. He only buys puts lol he’s a gay bear. I don’t know why you’re defending him though?

2021-05-14 04:28:13,wallstreetbets,Indeed

2021-05-14 10:18:32,wallstreetbets,Do not hold calls
2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Nikola may come back from the dead So I recently did some day trading with NKLA and made a solid $25 bucks (I know...thanks)

With that said I started to look at the company again after the borderline fraud scheme seems to be hitting the bottom.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tailwinds

1. Losses per share well beat expectations for the quarter. Projection was -$0.46 and they [actually](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nkla/earnings) lost -$0.31/share.....still losing money, but not as fast
2. The Tre (Chinese for 3) recently had a [successful](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/nikola-tre-semi-ev-drag-races-ford-f-350-work-truck-holds-up-well-for-a-while-160876.html) second place finish is a drag race against a Ford F350. Yeah I know it lost, but it held it's ground and shows that there is a functional prototype. Unlike the million EV car companies, TSLA and DDIAF (eCascadia) are the only (known to me) EV long haul truck companys competing, please enlighten me if you know more. BTW:[eCascadia](https://freightliner.com/trucks/ecascadia/?gclid=CjwKCAjwnPOEBhA0EiwA609ReaHPFfSnVomfrb5lOe0dcGAkOkMF-ec-TZ11GsUDMBWIbvxKMQMZzxoCJCUQAvD_BwE) looks cool
3. Nikola has a [LOI](https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-iveco-and-oge-announce-intent-to-accelerate-the-deployment-of-hydrogen-infrastructure-and-fueling-solutions-116) with some Germans to eat Schnitzel and create a hydrogen fuel cell infrastructure in Europe. This is a big deal because Germany is ([maybe](https://electrek.co/2016/06/14/all-new-cars-mandated-electric-germany-2030/)) going all electric by 2030 and Nikola could be a major winner on the logistics front. Once in Germany (The largest economy in Europe), it will more easily branch to the rest of the EU. 
4. The Shares are pretty cheap, being $0.35 on the 52 weak low.

Headwinds

1. They have sold zero semi-trucks
2. If you try to buy a truck you can only send an email to a [faceless void](https://nikolamotor.com/two#motor-contact).
3. Like other blank check EV offerings, NKLA is being chased by [lawyers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-03/spac-crackdown-threatens-gauzy-forecasts-that-power-ev-startups).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Yet to be seen on South Park](https://preview.redd.it/nsbo4oj1zyy61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7058144f353c67c0e915fac4c0f622cc6b66bcf)

&#x200B;

Conclusion: I'm keeping my money on the sideline for now, but if there is any updates on the Germany junk or actual sales, I'll come back around. This could go to zero or probably $50-60/share based on news."
2021-05-13 20:15:08,wallstreetbets,Lol.....No. This company is a joke and the share price is only being propped up to current value by bagholders that refuse to realize their 60%+ loss desperately hoping for greater fools to take their place.
2021-05-13 22:44:25,wallstreetbets,Tre is not 3 in chinese... LOL

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Natera (NTRA) - Long Term or Short Term Biotech Play Fellow morons,

I'm going to keep this more or less brief, even though I'm sure no one will actually read this. Being in medical school, I may be slightly less retarded than some of you, at least when it comes to identifying groundbreaking biotech companies. Pretty much all my friends are tired of hearing me talk about this company, even as they have increased from $35 pre-pandemic to $125 in February. Just kidding, I don't have any friends.

Natera (NTRA) is a diagnostic genetics company that specializes in the following three areas:

1) **Pre-natal testing:** making sure your kids aren't retarded

2) **Pre-transplant testing:** making sure your dumbass immune cells don't fuck up that new kidney you just got transplanted

3) **Cancer testing:** Finding out how much cancer is in your body by looking at the pieces of DNA that the cancer cells shed into your blood. The way we do this nowadays is by CT scans or MRIs, which aren't bad but can't find the cancer until it is big enough to see (\~5 mm). Also, they cost a shit ton of money, and CT scans expose you to radiation (which can cause more cancer later).

Point #3 is the reason why an irresponsibly large portion of my portfolio is in this company. They are already approved in **colorectal cancer** to:

1) Detect the levels of cancer in your body after surgery and help the oncologist determine if chemotherapy is even necessary

2) Determine whether the patient is responding to chemotherapy

3) Find out if the patient's cancer has come back on a microscopic level way before a scan could

The way these kinds of tests go in terms of FDA approval is that **they get approved in one cancer type initially before getting approved in cancer in general**. More cancer types = more revenue = higher stock price. As it turns out, all cancers are kind of fundamentally the same regardless of where they come from in your body. This was the case with Foundation Medicine (FMI), a company I YOLO'd on before they got bought out at $137 a share that was first to market in qualitative tumor measurement (Natera's test is quantitative). Oh, and Natera works with Foundation Medicine, so they will probably end up being first to market in this expanding indication too.

Natera just annihilated earnings but has sold off because all growth stocks are selling off. Their Y/Y revenue increased by 62%, and they have risen after earnings every single earnings report for the last 5 or so quarters. Median price target is $137.50. 

**The only reason I'm not buying more is that I pay $40,000 a year to harvest old men's discharge from their cocks and am out of cash. Don't be like me; buy this shit at a discount and watch it print fat stacks.**

$Long NTRA, $NTRA 120c 6/18

**TL;DR:** Natera (NTRA) is going to change the way we treat cancer, just crushed earnings, and is only selling off because growth stocks are selling off. They will inevitably surpass previous highs barring macroeconomic growth stock clusterfucks."

2021-05-13 21:02:31,wallstreetbets,SNDL diluted when the share price was very high. Other marijuana companies that recently diluted are selling shares at very low price and so their dilution is not as effective. SNDL over the past few weeks have released some promising news about M&A. On their balance sheet they have around 1 billion in cash. They can use this to conduct worldwide M&A and develop a sustainable business model. SNDL has lots of future potential and I believe it will the industry leader in a few years!

Weed can be just good enough,  which in today’s terms means it’s pretty fucking great.  These big companies in tobacco and also large plant growers for retailers will make the switch because they have the land and resources to grow in quantities none of these other ones can do.  

They will grow so much the price of cannabis will tank and these currently traded cannabis stocks will be ruined and try to merge with each other in the hopes of staying around.  The worst thing for the companies (which they won’t say) is the federal government legalizing cannabis."

I can see them buying companies but companies like TLRY who buy out entire corporations aren’t bending over to get screwed when they’re the “Pepsi of Weed” and SNDL becomes the “Coke of weed”. I just don’t see that happening.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CCL / Carnival Cruise Line I've made a bit since last year playing the ups and downs on CCL stock, put in about 1k when it crashed down to 8$ at the start of the covid nonsense, and kept feeding it every time it dipped. with a good half dozen complete sell offs when it peaked only to buy back in within 1-2 weeks when it dipped again.  
As it stands, I think the cruise industry got hit the worst by covid, but I think its popular enough that it will be around long after the plague ends.  This stock was in the high 60$s in 2018, and down from some mishaps to the 50$s and high 40$s in 2019.   Its got good potential in a long run of doubling any investment, but that could be 3 to 5 years at the earliest.  For the short haul though, it has dipped back down to 25$\~ and could easily rebound as it has the past 3 months bouncing between 25$ and 30$  
Other than like 10 AMC stock and a clutch few GME, I think this is my cash cow, and uhh, I like you apes, so look into it and decide if its right for you, cheers.  


tl;dr-  ccl is at one of its lows, could gain 2-5 $ real quick.

2021-05-14 11:31:03,wallstreetbets,"I bought CCL at 8 and RCL at 24 (RCL was trading at 165 before COVID) because I bet this was short lived and that cruising is never going away.

Ports are starting to open back up and both CCL and RCL are getting crews vaccinated to resume US sailings. Both of these companies are going to get back, within 2 years, not 3 to 5."
2021-05-13 23:23:27,wallstreetbets,"I don't previous highs are in play, but 40 is a legit good target. That's nearly 50% upside. I like it."
2021-05-14 03:37:23,wallstreetbets,"I think cruises are pretty much dead for the next few years:
- they have to rehire a massive amount of people and will have lost a lot of experienced staff. Higher costs and worse service ahoy.

- as pointed out above, they are drowning in debt so future profitability is eaten up be interest payments. Even if they recover to 2019 income, they won't be able to return to 2019 profits.

- the risk of getting stuck on a boat with a disease is now a real threat that people buying holidays will factor in. Maybe it's not rational, but risk-averse boomers will be thinking about this.

- the boats have been depreciating and have likely been under-maintained during Covid. Also if their future profitability is reduced, they will need to write down the value of the boat assets. A small change in NBV of the boats will wipe out several years of profit.

So to me this would be a risk worth looking at if Carnival was still 80-90% down from its 2019 high. It's currently around 58% down from pre-Covid so I think it's currently at a price that fairly represents its lower future cash flows. Maybe a bit of room for growth, but I think 2x from here even over the next 10 years is unlikely because the debt is so massive.

# TA Notes -

* SPY closed above the 410 mark.
* Some support at 20 SMMA
* **Bulls need to now take 413 vol trigger/resistance and fill gap.**
* **Bears need to take back 410 and head back down to 405.**
* **Best case for bulls - gap up, further from 410**
* **Best case for bears - gap down under 410 and test resistance.**

# TA Notes:

* Bears held 320.
* Support at 60 SMMA.
* We could consolidate in the 310-320 range like we did for most of March from a daily perspective.
* **Bulls need to see 320 break and support and 325 break.**
* **Bears need to break 60 SMMA and hold 320 support. Look for 315-310.**
* **Best case for bulls is a gap above 320 resistance and test and hold new support.**

2021-05-13 23:42:08,wallstreetbets,So what was the massive selloff at the end of the day about? Seemed out of left field.
2021-05-13 22:56:38,wallstreetbets,Felt like spy was being propped up
2021-05-13 23:00:10,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Seemed a bit off end of day. Massive buying, then selling at 3:57"
2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TRQ golden opportunity to get in. The company beat earning estimates, yoy earning beat. The stock is 20% down because the company slightly revised their 2021 projections, but those projections are still 300% over last year. Copper ain't getting cheaper any time soon and this company produces a lot "
2021-05-13 21:47:13,wallstreetbets,"Didn’t their Canadian mine just suffer a very bad wall collapse? 

I know their Mongolian mine just shut down for Covid."
2021-05-13 20:49:21,wallstreetbets,What did he say
2021-05-13 21:37:46,wallstreetbets,he said copper could come down a little bit from recent highs
2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Time to sell TSLA Elon Musk is unstable and attention crazed. TSLA made a billion dollar investment and backed out in three months. This is either a lack of due diligence and incompetence OR a transparent attempt to manipulate earnings because they do not make enough money selling electric vehicles.

This is in addition to lack of vehicle demand in China. the long term future of Tesla is in the hands of a man stripped of his Chairmanship, is obsessed with his second rocket company and moonlights as a twitter/social media celebrity while also dating 20 year olds and hitting up night clubs. EDIT: He also uses TSLA as a credit card with 92 million shares pledged for loans EDIT 2: apparently grimes is 33. My bad. I was more alluding to their strange behavior together than the still quite sizable age gap

&#x200B;

Sell TSLA. There are better investments for your money. the stock is over valued because of Musk. Musk is becoming more and more unpredictable.

&#x200B;

Disclosure. no longer long TSLA other than through funds i otherwise like. own: gme, amc

&#x200B;

i also have solar panels that were from solar city now Tesla. the worst app, customer service and everything i have ever used."
2021-05-13 23:26:02,wallstreetbets,"We live in bizarro world so invest in whatever dumb shit you want.   


That said.. talking about DD when you just own shares of AMC and GME is pretty funny."

2021-05-13 23:28:54,wallstreetbets,As an FYI the China plant produces cars for more than just China.
2021-05-13 23:40:39,wallstreetbets,I am a true retard but even then I'd buy TSLA now if I could afford.
2021-05-14 01:29:01,wallstreetbets,Agree.   Agree.   Tesla is in for a big and very rude awakening.
2021-05-14 01:43:00,wallstreetbets,"I honestly cannot tell, wether TSLA will go up and down,

2021-05-13 22:57:09,wallstreetbets,"Relax, they sold 10% of it. They are the crown jewel of my portfolio and I refuse to be a paper-handed bitch over a 4 month decline after I've held for almost 6 years.

If you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen. As a long term TSLA shareholder I welcome this opportunity to shake out paper-hands and short term focused investors, having a quality majority long term shareholder base that is bought into the vision of the company is worth a decent amount of value.  


Edit: Positions: approx 33% of portfolio in TSLA shares"
2021-05-13 20:50:21,wallstreetbets,Elon Musk is certainly unstable and obsessed with been in the lime light. He  will say anything just to get in the media. Only a fool would trust Musk he will back something one day and be against it the next. Has for TSLA there are far better cars out there. The future for TSLA is not bright and there will soon crash. Sell now and invest else were before you lose it all. Remember Wire Card over 100 Euro one day and Lee than 1 Euro the next. Tesla's great fall is coming so bail out now.
2021-05-13 21:20:27,wallstreetbets,I upvoted your post but I will buy Tesla anytime it is below 550 until my investment thesis changes

2021-05-14 01:14:57,wallstreetbets,TIME TO BUY AMC😎😎😎
2021-05-13 20:30:33,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is like the old Studebaker. Fancy at first, new technology. 

But they will get swallowed whole by GM, Ford, VW, Hyundai, Toyota, Honda. 

The only reason they are positive at all is the environmental credits that the other car companies buy. 

Once all of the car companies ramp up, Tesla will sell zero credits. They will lose money and be forced to raise their price to $150k. It’s going to be like a Ferrari. Ridiculously expensive, not the best performing, looks pretty.

TSLA will be GME in 5 years. Washed up and worthless."

2021-05-13 22:11:04,wallstreetbets,Enough to go to the moon 🚀
2021-05-13 22:31:55,wallstreetbets,"Lots of people are all on Elon's nuts. But the reality is if Tesla had some boring but stable old suit with great management and financial experience in the automobile sector, Tesla would be more grown, respected and taken seriously by its competitors.

Ford, GM, Toyota and most other automakers will eventually overtake Tesla in EV sales, even with the head start they had over the others.

Musk is holding his company back. Get out while you can."

2021-05-14 00:40:21,wallstreetbets,TSLA's value depends on Elon's ability to hype himself and his companies.

2021-05-14 02:06:53,wallstreetbets,I wish the reddit folks would short the hell out of Tesla.. that would teach the b*stard Elon a good lesson for toying with people’s investments!
2021-05-14 02:08:05,wallstreetbets,"None of this is new, though. Musk has posted insane stuff on Twitter before, and then continued to release another wildly successful car.

Good luck with your gme and amc shares and let me hold my Tesla, time will tell who made the best decision !"

2021-05-14 09:02:21,wallstreetbets,"I already know he has a tweet lined up “ we solved the environmental issues with it by carbon offsetting and will be open purchases “   It will shoot to 65k thinking he solved the Middle East crisis 

Look at the positive of the rumors are he bought at 30k and “ sold  “ even if he did at 40k he made a good fucking profit for the company .

I guarantee he bought the dip and will enjoy the profits of going from 50k to 60k+"
2021-05-14 09:03:33,wallstreetbets,Let me guess... You own some coin that Elon no longer supports...
2021-05-14 09:14:25,wallstreetbets,Calls boys
2021-05-14 09:20:08,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is a good stock for daytrading. As a long hold it seems like gambling to me, valuation is still very high here and the future bull cases with robotaxis etc seem like fantasies at this point in time."
2021-05-14 09:39:28,wallstreetbets,"Dude idk where you've been but nothing you mentioned hasn't already happened before in some way or form. Tesla makes crazy decisions all the time that defy logic, and Elon Musk is and has always been unhinged. Long $TSLA WOOOOO!!!!!"

2021-05-14 11:22:38,wallstreetbets,"It's time to BUY TSLA. They have several great projects in the pipeline. The Cybertruck, New Roadster, Semi-Truck, Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Full Self-drive. Besides other parallel business like Energy Power Packs, Solar Roof, Insurance, Supercharger Station Network. The simple comparison with other auto-makers is superficial."

Yes the stocks market now   is down but everything that goes up have to come down and everything that is down soon  or later with goes up too. Validation of the information is the best advice I can give to anyone..."

2021-05-13 20:32:06,wallstreetbets,Ok will add some more $TSLA shares tomorrow for long bucket. Thanks for the suggestion

2021-05-13 20:41:43,wallstreetbets,They're sitting on their 200 sma. Either they melt back up and everyone sleeps soundly or cnbc keeps preaching the commodity supercycle and inflation hellscapes. I don't know about you guys but let me know if you finally get Cramers cell. I think it makes more sense to be a short term Tesla bear
2021-05-13 20:55:56,wallstreetbets,Or he is attempting to lower the price so others can enter the market.
2021-05-13 21:00:48,wallstreetbets,"Boils some tsla today - even if it turns out to be just a short trade, it has a few more pops left in the battery..."

2021-05-13 23:40:01,wallstreetbets,I'd hold off until 200.
2021-05-14 00:07:40,wallstreetbets,One thing everyone seems to not be acknowledging is the majority of Tesla’s revenue has come from selling electric credits to companies that primarily make gas vehicles. Over the past two years 90% of those have been sold to Damler Chrysler (or however you spell it). They just bought an electric division and said they will no longer be buying credits. Without them Tesla would’ve had very negative earnings the past few years. Look up the Forbes article about it from a week or so ago
2021-05-13 20:02:02,wallstreetbets,Nice! Just loaded up on 230 calls all the way up to 800. Retirement play.
2021-05-13 20:46:05,wallstreetbets,So TSLA did everything wrong? Calls all the way around.  I knew TSLA sitting at $570 had to be a meme so I better load up now. Weekly 2000Cs is it then?
2021-05-13 21:34:39,wallstreetbets,Those will print mad money.
2021-05-14 03:14:18,wallstreetbets,All my energy and retirement into margin TSLA calls AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH

2021-05-14 00:32:34,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-14 05:39:34,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-14 09:01:04,wallstreetbets,Even OP's mother is cringing at this advice. She just saw Elon on SNL and thought he was charming and intelligent and funny. She loves that he's thinking green and not afraid to cut his losses or put his money where his heart is.

2021-05-13 20:53:27,wallstreetbets,If you want more money sell now and invest the proceeds more wisely. 💲🪙💰
2021-05-14 04:36:34,wallstreetbets,Uk tbvh gme as of now might actually be a really good play in the long term if you got in before 120 or so
2021-05-14 05:31:55,wallstreetbets,"Exactly

That's every guy's dream when he's older

And I hear women like older (RICH) men too"
2021-05-14 00:23:22,wallstreetbets,"I know right? Its the only reason for fame. Id love to be rich, hate to be famous, but banging 20 year olds till you die might be worth it."
2021-05-13 20:21:55,wallstreetbets,And Elon’s dad fucked his granddaughter or some shit like that...
2021-05-13 23:50:16,wallstreetbets,Except that there's 20 of them.
2021-05-13 22:03:31,wallstreetbets,Not at all
2021-05-14 00:28:13,wallstreetbets,"I mostly agree with OP, however if it dips to under 400 it'll be a good buying opportunity. It's clear that Elon is losing it, maybe he'll recover from it maybe he won't. If you're planning on buying TSLA then ask yourself - how much would Tesla be worth without Elon? And then set your buy orders at that limit."
2021-05-14 04:47:33,wallstreetbets,Tesla up 2% premarket. I'm inversing this guy with some 0DTE calls at open
2021-05-14 09:22:53,wallstreetbets,Remind me! 2 months
2021-05-13 20:47:51,wallstreetbets,My favorite is when you say something critical of him and then everyone on this sub says it’s because you are jealous of him Lolol.
2021-05-14 00:12:44,wallstreetbets,Na man we just love what he’s doing
2021-05-14 10:30:09,wallstreetbets,"I'm not a fan of what he does on Twitter or in media in general, but tell me a person who does more for the future of humanity than he does. I'll wait.

EDIT: Well, now I've waited, so I guess that's settled then."
2021-05-14 00:47:35,wallstreetbets,build quality yes. Tech no. Tesla is way ahead from a tech perspective.
2021-05-13 21:28:37,wallstreetbets,Well said Tesla is heeding for the strap heap there are far better cars out there. Nio will soon overtake Tesla. In China Nio as solved the problem of it taking a long time to recharge as it as a  growing network of battery changing stations where you can drive in and they swap your batteries over. Apparently you can be on your way in less than five minutes not much longer than  filling a petrol car.
2021-05-13 23:02:40,wallstreetbets,How much of a car company is Tesla vs an energy storage and AI company?
2021-05-14 01:07:44,wallstreetbets,Their.....
2021-05-14 14:51:22,wallstreetbets,Tesla will sell better in Europe once giga Berlin opens up. They will be able to sell the model y significantly cheaper
2021-05-13 20:44:57,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a good argument for dog money then.
2021-05-14 08:40:07,wallstreetbets,"Enron, learn from history."
2021-05-14 17:42:29,wallstreetbets,Well if the stock has volatile price movements based on hype it must be good. bUY!!!!
2021-05-14 03:21:30,wallstreetbets,"Its not magic coin, that just makes you sound like a bitter loser. The scientific term is ""imaginary internet monies""."
2021-05-14 10:42:45,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, i am sure he did that"
2021-05-13 21:46:10,wallstreetbets,"And the 25k car.

And then, one day in the distant future, the pivot towards a Robotaxi based business model."
2021-05-14 01:23:40,wallstreetbets,Battery and software technology is light years ahead for Tesla compared to other companies
2021-05-14 15:00:03,wallstreetbets,Quality control issues almost exclusively linked to their fremont plant. The newer shanghai plant is much more representative of the future. And production numbers continue to ramp up I don't see what issue there is here
2021-05-13 21:35:28,wallstreetbets,Yes and just think if everyone on WB sold there Tesla shares how many AMC shares we could buy.
2021-05-13 21:49:05,wallstreetbets,"It’s not just China. Every major industrialized country at some level considers auto manufacturing to be a national security issue. Tesla just won’t be allowed to swallow market share. 

A Tesla factory in France would get firebombed in month. Unions there are nuts."
2021-05-13 22:04:06,wallstreetbets,"I kinda feel EV is going to happen the same way the 5G tech unfolded. 

Huawei got all these contracts for 5G across the world, people complained and eventually they were cancelled for security reasons. 

I feel like the Chinese EVs will get into global markets, while blocking Tesla and musk will bitch to Congress that it’s not fair because China is blocking them/VW/GM and others while they operate globally. Chinese EVs will get banned in the US/EU and we’ll have fractured EV markets. 

Just speculation and brainstorming, but I could see it happen."
2021-05-13 21:02:20,wallstreetbets,Buy NIO?
2021-05-13 21:08:49,wallstreetbets,are you aware how much china helped Tesla set up that factory?... now your saying china is a problem xD LMAOOO
2021-05-13 21:18:43,wallstreetbets,"The Chinese always steal tech,  they haven't invented anything since gunpowder.  Why invent when people are stupid enough to let you steal their tech so I guess it's a sound strategy that never fails"
2021-05-13 23:46:43,wallstreetbets,TSLA needs e-motorcycle.... lots of people of China will ride it 🦍🦍🚀🚀
2021-05-14 00:34:06,wallstreetbets,I don't currently own Tsla but having been to China many times for work. They pay a premium to own Apple and Samsung because they attribute that to America. They will likely pay a premium to own a Tsla as well. It's all about imagine and anything American is gold over there.
2021-05-13 20:55:43,wallstreetbets,$120
2021-05-14 00:43:35,wallstreetbets,I'd DCA from $400 to however low it goes.

2021-05-13 20:04:13,wallstreetbets,But would you pay for the privilege?
2021-05-13 23:23:38,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2021-05-13 21:47:48,wallstreetbets,They always buy and sell to keep it at 10% weight. That's the only criteria that matters to evaluate ARK's position.
2021-05-13 21:39:34,wallstreetbets,"I don,t"
2021-05-13 23:34:07,wallstreetbets,"*our eyes connect from across a crowded room and suddenly you hear my voice in your head* “Batteries, dude.. batteries..”"
2021-05-13 21:09:50,wallstreetbets,I think Musk built up too much ill will and it's coming back on him now along with the shorts
2021-05-13 21:46:00,wallstreetbets,Good move. Just think if everyone on WB sold there Tesla shares how many AMC we could buy.
2021-05-13 22:25:49,wallstreetbets,You lost me at Uber
2021-05-13 21:09:11,wallstreetbets,"Bill hwang staked the first 4 ark etfs. They pray together. Ark etfs make up massive % in many of their stocks. Only half ark money is in the etfs so those numbers are probably higher. She has to sell more liquid stocks like TSLA so the other ones don’t crash more. 

Not advice. Opinion"
2021-05-13 23:24:52,wallstreetbets,I'm not buying tesla until I see rednecks hoarding AA batteries in plastic bags thinking they're going to profit off of electric cars.
2021-05-13 23:31:56,wallstreetbets,"I don't think Tesla is going anywhere, but as the years go on, they will no longer hold their competitive advantage in the electric vehicle market.

The reality is, the competition is starting to catch up. While I HATE the new Mustang Mach-E, it is getting rave reviews and the one thing that consistently stands out from the reviews is that it is a better built, better handling, and overall more usable car than any Tesla.

The Porsche Taycan is a significantly better car than a Model S in almost every conceivable manner. Fit and finish is superior, the handling and driving characteristics are on par with what you expect from a Porsche, and the car can repeatedly perform throughout the day unlike a Tesla which battery won't allow it to stay at peak performance past a few laps/hot runs.  


EDIT: Downvote away people, I understand there are a lot of Tesla fanboys on here, and thats fine. But do even a modicum of research on the car market and you will see that Tesla does not provide a good product when compared to the competition."
2021-05-14 06:51:00,wallstreetbets,"Quit the crap they spent billions expanding, Elon compensation plan, R&D and new factories. If you took that away and not care for future growth their earnings would be A+"
2021-05-13 22:25:34,wallstreetbets,Agree 100%. I say... That is the way.
2021-05-14 00:01:11,wallstreetbets,"u/Flrg808, I totally agree with you. I think u/TheB1ackPrince just got the taste of the market. Isn't the market sweet guys? Instead of shitting on Elon, this dude should celebrate his LOSS. In fact, If I were Mr. Musk, I would take u/TheB1ackPrince's girlfriend to enjoy life a bit more. Welcome to the modern day's casino of the World Stock Market"
2021-05-14 01:21:51,wallstreetbets,He didn't use complicated words .. he didn't use crayons to draw anything .. no strange numbers involved .. sounds like Elon in person
2021-05-14 07:41:35,wallstreetbets,But now I have to inverse you? I am so confused. Maybe I need to inverse myself a few times.
2021-05-14 11:19:20,wallstreetbets,I bought 1 690 call expiring soon. So far so good. Tesla should hit 700 next week again.
2021-05-13 23:22:24,wallstreetbets,I live in California. I would say 1 out of every 20 are Tesla's where I am. Also I just got one lol
2021-05-13 23:07:55,wallstreetbets,"yes, because the state dictates if you are allowed to buy a car, and if so, what kind.  They are currently mandating EVs to people."
2021-05-13 20:21:50,wallstreetbets,But in case you want to make money bet against elon from time to time
2021-05-14 10:34:45,wallstreetbets,"Talking about the underlying value of a stock is FUD? It's worth $17.50 at a P/E of 25, or $56 if you use forward P/E. All evidence and reason says TSLA is overvalued as fuck.

Even if there was nothing but good news, TSLA would be a hard sell. The price isn't justified, it hasn't been justified for a long time."
2021-05-14 05:40:03,wallstreetbets,When I need an emergency fund I just go behind the dumpster at Wendy's and give out slurpees for cash.

2021-05-14 02:35:39,wallstreetbets,"I'd really like to know what specific technology Telsa has that's seen as being exclusive to them and light years ahead of their competitors.To their benefit (and possible detriment in the long haul) they have taken great tech that's out there and been early adopters for mass produced vehicles. That tech isn't unique to them. For batteries they're using Panasonic cells with no exclusivity. The 2170 is widely available to the point where Samsung is competing with Panasonic for the largest shares of the market. VW will be using the 4680 and it will very likely also be used by Nio. Audi, BMW, and Ford/Lincoln are all advancing quickly with their autonomous driving functionality, and solutions like Baidu's Apollo open up that tech to any auto maker who wants to outsource that tech (cheaper Chinese auto manufacturers). Honestly the most advanced autonomous vehicle tech right now isn't what you're seeing any of these companies or Tesla use in passenger cars, it's what's being used in park shuttles that rolled out this past year or so. As for controls, Tesla's touchscreens are great when they work and when you're parked or don't need to do something multiple taps deep into the menu. Competitors sticking more to tactical tech for controls isn't really a bad thing as long as those control work, their more common issues are a slow experience in using touch screens for accessory & luxury controls."

That might be some kind of digital video-game purchasing system, like Apple's (AAPL) App Store or Valve's Steam. Additionally, some hope the company will pivot into popular online gaming streaming. Amazon.com (AMZN) is finding success there with its Twitch online service.
The company sell more shares and used the proceeds to cut its $216 million in long-term debt. That debt carried a costly 10% interest rate and matured in 2023.


Love a company thats debt free

>Shorting activity is down sharply — as short sellers see the risk of their moves and pull back. Shorts only control 15% of GME stock now, says S&P Global Market Intelligence, down from roughly 90% in early 2021.


>the situation changed dramatically earlier on this year when a Reddit fuelled short squeeze sent its shares soaring and helped the company in raising as much as $551 million in the form of fresh capital by selling only 3.5 million units.

Fresh injection of capital helped the company in clearing its long-term debt and gave it the platform for long-term growth. More importantly, it is also necessary to point out that in 2020, GameStop had managed to grow its e-commerce business by as much as 191% and that is something that the company is likely to look into in its future growth plans.
On the other hand, the GME stock is pretty cheap at the moment and trades at only 2.26 times its revenues.

Amazon or other ecommerce stocks trade at much much higher multiples.

Tesla tends to underperform at the beginning of the year but that seems significant regardless, 96.5% of the EVs sold in the EU in January were not Tesla vehicles. Plus PSA, Citroen and Fiat Chryslter have merged in Stellantis. From my perspective, I think there's going to start getting more and more media hype against Tesla because of their poor performance in the European market (typical doom and gloom stuff, but Tesla has a lot of emotional investors).  


Now VW's major break through will probably start to emerge in the 6-18 month timeline, probably seeing a series of increases. There's a McKinsey report from like, 2018 on the Chinese automobile market which basically shows a major preference for German brands over any other nationality, including American. VW already has big ICE market share and production actually started in December for their ID.6 SUV in China and by the end of the year they're expecting to have aroudn 600,000 units in annual production and 1,000,000 by 2022.

You don't think changes might happen in 20 years in EU as their financial situation continues to worsen?

your average spanish person buys a used SEAT 4 cylinder and keeps it forever.  Repairs are in the hundreds, and even then hard to afford for them.

And secondly,  his father was rich. Do I think the rich have $28k lying around? Yes. Yes, I do.   


Do I think most mothers will fight tooth and nail to scrape up $10k for their kid at all costs? Yes, yes I do.  


I grew up with a fully disabled mother and a father working 60-70 hours every week as an electrician for a saw mill AND going full time to school (on loans). My sister's liver failed without cause (and she's in textbooks for it). Over $100k in medical expenses later, she lived. So my dad spent 5 years finishing college while working himself to death to take care of us. We were lower middle class by total income, but adjusted income due to medical bills for mom and my sister put us solidly in the poor category. When I got the opportunity to go with People to People as a student ambassador? A nearly $5000 venture? They found a way, which I'm sure included loans. That's what parents DO, bud.   


And that's why I've spent my adult life making sure to do things for them, even though they're in a much better financial situation now (dad finished his electrical engineering degree summa cum laude and has consistently moved up in jobs). I came from that situation and finished my aerospace engineering degree with a top aerospace school, on loans with $80k in debt coming out. I've consistently moved up.

Thursday 6:45 PM

70F Sunset, Clear skies

Achieving a state of sanguineness does not require irrational ebullience or a leap of faith. Sometimes all that is required is a pragmatic and probabilistically reasoned exercise of courage - both an acknowledgement of the many hurdles that lie ahead, but also the very intentional choice to acquire the composure, caution, and courage to alter those circumstances so that probability is weighted in your favor - essentially making the choice to brave that journey towards nirvana. Inspiration can be fickle, circumstances volatile, and faith fleeting, but habits are steady. Progress can be made incrementally, bounded by fear on one end and procrastination on the other, ensuring it is always steady and never rushed.

My knight /u/memetron9000 shall remain by my side through this journey, flanked by /u/sloptart69 and /u/angrysc0tsman12 as my men at arms, with nary a doubt in our minds on our path to nirvana."

But that’s because she doesn’t know why you’re really drinking. She doesn’t know what calls are, or that you put your joint savings into them at the top on Monday.

Several dizzying minutes later, you realize she’s too drunk to come, and so are you. This is going no where.

Either NIO is severely undervalued (which is likely considering its market cap is barely at 50B right now)

2021-05-14 04:09:13,wallstreetbets,"“For years, investors refused to back the Bowflex, saying it looked like an octopus or a spider — not like an exercise machine. Instead, the Bowflex went on to become the fastest-selling piece of exercise equipment in the United States with sales pole-vaulting from $10 million in 1995 to $585 million in 2002, nearly doubling each year.

But it's that very success that nearly killed the company.

The Bowflex became so popular it inspired a legion of imitators — including one that took matters into its own hands, just as the 17-year patent for the Bowflex was due to expire.”

And I lost my millionaire hopes in an overlevwraged investment on $ROPE

Got pissed off and ripped u/memetron9000 nips off 

Smacked u/darkbyte so hard I knocked the 🦋 tat under her tits off

I lay naked in the grass, sugar in my ass, in shambles like some broken glass

We incurred net losses of approximately $7.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. As of March 31, 2021, we had net working capital of approximately $231 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $195 million. We have not yet achieved profitability.

Buying the big tech stocks, i.e. MSFT, AAPL, etc, value, and S&P dip (and expecting good returns in the mid-term) requires the suspension of all reasonable incredulity. 

You’re betting on a perfect storm, being low rates, low inflation, yet continuous stimulus via money printing, with no monetary, economic, and geopolitical hiccups as we sit at ATHs with goldilocks p/e ratios."

2021-05-13 20:50:00,wallstreetbets,"I have a question.   

GME went up a lot today.  Volume was 4.5 million shares higher than past 10 days.  Was this a liquidation of a short position (the sharp spike must have been)?  Was it driven by algos on the back of AMC? Do the algos just keep it after they buy it (4.5 x $160 = $720 million)?   Does it have to do with hedge fund margin calls due to declines of other assets (this is what I think)."
2021-05-13 21:03:34,wallstreetbets,At least a lot of the new people learned to never hold puts when you’re up big. Now if Tesla could rebound $60 tomorrow I could finally hit big on Tesla weeklies

I wanna go with Joe because I'm pretty sure he has a longer reach but Trump's got that ButterBean physique going on and that dude had a cannon for an arm.  Biden does cardio though so he might be able to outlast Trump.  If Biden doesn't get knocked out in round two or three then I'd give it to him.  Trump would be a 3 round fighter max in my opinion, remember that dude loves his McDongles"

2021-05-13 21:49:45,wallstreetbets,It's not inflation the market fears. It's what the federal reserve will do in response to inflation --- raise interest rates. The market is pricing in a high interest rate environment. That would explain bank stocks going up
2021-05-13 21:53:56,wallstreetbets,Except that interest rates would rise.

It’s the original play, while AMC was what people rushed to after they felt they missed out on the ride up while looking for high short interest stocks to “squeeze”. I personally believe GME could still actually short squeeze, and if it doesn’t, it has potential to grow regardless. Plus no one wants to go to movies or overpay for popcorn anymore."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$DGX suddenly a PRIME Short Squeeze candidate DD Congrats to those who have made some tendies following my previous $DGX DDs series over the past 3 months (see post history). Although the returns have already been excellent, I stumbled across some additional data over the past 48hrs that make $DGX Quest Diagnostics even more enticing. Astonishingly, short interest has TRIPLED recently. No, this isn't your 50%+ short **obvious** short squeeze play, but hear me out. This short interest is a suicide play that's flying under the radar.

* $DGX is a relatively low volume stock. Hence this tripling of short interest has resulted in a Days to Cover ratio of 8.6. For perspective (**not** to disparage these plays), Days to Cover is below 1 for both GME and AMC.
* 8.6 Days to Cover is ABSURDLY high for a safe blue chip stock with elite financials and tons of cash on hand. Again, for even more perspective, close competitor $LH Labcorp sits at 1.9.
* Now here's the icing on the cake. The cherry on top. The tug after the massage:
   * **93% of $DGX float is owned by institutions**. After recent buybacks, their float presently sits at 130m shares, 121m of which is owned by institutions.
      * Vanguard is the largest holder. Blackrock recently increased their large stake as well. Safe dividend stock = low churn from institutions. They hold.
   * $DGX recently approved $1.5 billion ASR (accelerated share repurchase), meaning they are GUARANTEED to repurchase nearly 10% of float by Q4: roughly 10 to 11 MILLION shares.

**Napkin crayon math:** Present float of 130m LESS low churn institutional holdings = ""Retail"" is playing with 10m shares. The ASR alone requires the repurchasing of 10 million shares. Now add in that short interest recently spiked to 11 million shares.

**Result (TL;DR):** Assuming institutions continue to mostly hold this safe dividend, blue chip stock with incredibly strong financials and a mountain of cash on hand, the $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase alone would propel this stock upwards. Throw the massive short interest spike on top and $DGX can rocket. This is honestly one of the dumbest short positions I've ever come across in the market. It is a suicide mission with high risk, minimal reward ($130 is rock bottom floor for this stock). It's so irrational that when I first saw it 2 days ago, I assumed it was a typo. It's too large to simply be a hedge. See DDs for non short interest related analysis.

**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Ally SUCKS as a brokerage. Use someone else"
2021-05-13 22:23:01,wallstreetbets,Fee to borrow is only 0.3% tho (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/DGX) which means the shorts can hold their position for a long ass time since they’re not paying much interest.

2021-05-14 03:55:05,wallstreetbets,Those squeezes already happened tho lol
2021-05-13 22:59:15,wallstreetbets,"True, but I figure the borrow fees each broker uses should be in the same ballpark since they should be based on the risk associated with shorting each stock. Unless their risk models are super different I’d expect them to be pretty similar. But yeah, could be wrong."
2021-05-13 20:29:16,wallstreetbets,"I checked just now and it's at $137 AH, which is pretty close to their ATH. I'm not against believing there's runway here, or that the company is putting shorters in a tough place with a buyback, but $130 being rock bottom seems optimistic."
2021-05-13 21:51:36,wallstreetbets,"If you disagree, then you expect this stock to trade well below 10 P/E for an **extended** period of time. Which as I pointed out in my previous DDs, has never happened in the past decade+."

2021-05-14 12:20:03,wallstreetbets,Not what I meant. Most brokerages you’re required to ask for different option levels and you have to answer questions related to your goals and option trading experience.

2021-05-14 17:27:00,wallstreetbets,"I think there’s a spot here to double it up. It’s clearly not just oversold, but in recent days it looks like the short borrow rates and failure to deliver have skyrocketed. It’s actually teed up to squeeze. I don’t see it staying above 15-16 with warrants outstanding but it’s a good combo right now."

I was going to try to put up a serious topic on weather or not I should sell. I need the money and unless GME hits $400 I won’t break even."
2021-05-13 20:01:43,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t you’d just be putting yourself further back while supporting people you’ve never met before. You won’t make money.
2021-05-13 20:27:42,wallstreetbets,"Yea I took a cash advance, yolo on some options, and am about to lose $2000 so don't to what I did. Do the right thing. Gamble later."
2021-05-13 22:48:53,wallstreetbets,It’s hard to live in the current economy with only two incomes. Might I suggest finding your wife a nice boyfriend?

Personally, I'm 100% in on GME, and will never be putting a dollar into anything else. I'm not selling until every single member of my family, every single one of my friends, and every single member of *their* families can **all** retire comfortably.

That's just me, though. But there will never be another infinite squeeze as GME will be."

2021-05-13 21:31:30,wallstreetbets,For me It's not all about the money. I make enough to live comfortably. Money that I put in stocks is money that I wouldn't mind losing which I currently have none due to family health problems.

They are going to drag this out and try to nuke everything else with it to avoid margin calls and admitting defeat.


Guess what, if the squeeze was allowed to play out in January, people would have gladly accepted $1k floors and shorts would cover, albeit bruised.

They flew too close to the sun and didn't learn their lesson so they tried again lmao"
2021-05-13 21:55:20,wallstreetbets,They want options to expire worthless. Just a short term approach. They know
2021-05-14 03:23:43,wallstreetbets,I'm suspicious that they may be slowly covering their positions to manageable levels and that that's the only reason the stock is holding the price its been for the last month. If thats true it could never squeeze and just slowly bleed forever.

2021-05-14 02:48:25,wallstreetbets,"I seriously doubt the Real Economy would collapse no matter how high the price goes, unless there is a major credit crunch because all the big banks got caught with toxic shorts, and the DTCC has been passing rules left right and centre to protect themselves and their members, Hedge funds are just not as important as they want everyone to believe. the clearing houses are somewhat important but there are rules to deal with continuity should they go bankrupt and the federal reserve is obligated to bailout the central clearinghouse to prevent the aforementioned credit crunch. Hyperinflation is a possibility but unlikely the Fed has been printing Dollars like maniacs for years and there's been barely any inflation what's a few more. And if there is an inflation issue then it's on congress to front up and pass a sensible budget that sucks the extra money out of the system.

And the SEC and the Fed have had since February to wind this situation up while it was small and everyone was happy to settle for $1k but they allowed shocking amounts of criminal behaviour to blow the whole crisis beyond all reason now people smell blood and like the taste. 

In the end we will see whether the US economy collapses or not when the bomb goes off."

2021-05-14 01:19:18,wallstreetbets,Yeah the Fed will have to step in once the chain of people who are responsible for paying out are flat broke. They have unlimited money so everyone will be paid in the end. We'll except for the 70 odd million shares that the company issued those holders will be left with whatever the true resting price is.

2021-05-13 20:00:40,wallstreetbets,Forex is like trying to hold a jar of pennies in your hand and trying to pick up more pennies on the road.  You make money slow and drop everything fast.  Fucking hate forex.

2021-05-14 04:34:28,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you didn't read where I said that the number that people bandy about doesn't matter because market forces will decide where the actual peak sits.

It's just a number to hype people up but the share holders are going to want the best price they can get for it be it $1000 per share or $1000000000 a share or wherever it falls inbetween.

Besides whether there's enough money in the world to pay is academic, a cash and carry doesn't worry where the money comes from so long as the customer pays for the goods, assuming the scale of the looming disaster is as bad as suggested the Fed will and has to print enough to cover the cost or face a liquidity crisis the likes it has never seen, a catastrophic loss in investor confidence in the US market, or will have to negotiate a settlement, or a combination of factors."

2021-05-14 14:01:17,wallstreetbets,"Your original 190k could relatively easily been worth 1.5 mil in 30 years. 

Good luck, but why risk it all?"
2021-05-14 14:01:48,wallstreetbets,why are you putting over 180k in game stop?  you could of bought a house and had supplemental income for life now your just pissing it away on a 12b mkt cap that is being hyped because it just announced an E-sports team.. this fourm makes me want to vomit .. lmao. good luck? i guess. lmao

2021-05-14 00:51:57,wallstreetbets,"🤷🏻‍♀️ I guess them paying off their debt years early, raising half a billion dollars without tanking their stock price, hiring execs and leaders from Amazon and Chewy to head their transformation into e-commerce and esports aren’t really signs of growth then. 

I still like the stock. I also like the fact that several new SEC rules are emerging now because of this stock. It’s accomplished far more than what the Occupy Wallstreet movement did in 2008 - in a much shorter time span. 

But ook ook, I eat crayons so .. 🚀🚀🚀"

2021-05-13 21:21:11,wallstreetbets,Yes this needs more backstory
2021-05-14 07:40:11,wallstreetbets,He probably meant 491
2021-05-14 02:44:45,wallstreetbets,It’s because of a ‘wash sale’ - I can’t explain it well enough unfortunately but that’s what causes that.. I unfortunately know from experience.
2021-05-13 22:01:14,wallstreetbets,bro like if its legit. why on earth would you play with your money like that? did you earn it yourself?
2021-05-13 21:03:39,wallstreetbets,"Hey, it won't matter soon enough. You have at least 7xx tickets to the moon."

2021-05-14 10:55:20,wallstreetbets,During after-hours trading GME touched the 500's.
2021-05-13 21:42:19,wallstreetbets,Wash sale bit you hard
2021-05-14 10:20:41,wallstreetbets,"The full story is too long, but let's just say that the rocket launching to the moon is probably a much smoother ride than GME has been for me. Those shares were purchased around $120-$160, but due to prior losses it assigned a wash sale cost basis of $591.6661. I learned accounting from Dumb-n-Dumber, and just keep a sticky note reminding myself this is my future beach house."
2021-05-14 03:25:56,wallstreetbets,Damn dude somehow sold for a loss then bought back in writhing 30 days and sold for a loss again. Tuff
2021-05-13 22:38:24,wallstreetbets,Figured it’s money I’m not gonna see for a while. I’m 32. I worked for it + previous company matched. Why not.
2021-05-13 23:55:56,wallstreetbets,"Some people just don't give a shit about themselves and think they're invincible.

Unless there's a larger nest egg somewhere and this is literally play money, this is a heinously stupid decision if you don't want to work until you're old."

2021-05-14 10:29:24,wallstreetbets,Ok yeah I can see how you could build up wash sales that big.
2021-05-14 14:01:33,wallstreetbets,I saw a video of this. Guy buys when it rises and sells when it goes down. Hilarious
2021-05-13 23:11:56,wallstreetbets,"Do you ever wonder if it's overvalued? Even at its best, $160/share is extreme for a company like GameStop. But $250+?! That's not counting the fact that GME short interest is down like 70%.

So my question is, did you do any DD of your own or are you just blindly hoping for the best?"
2021-05-14 00:09:15,wallstreetbets,"That’s the basis of my decision - I don’t want to work until I’m old.  I like the stock that much.

My larger nest egg is also diversified .. 100% in GME as well. Huehuehuehue"
2021-05-14 11:15:26,wallstreetbets,"You're probably right, I only remember lower 500's"
2021-05-14 14:24:57,wallstreetbets,Yup it’s immediately made worse because he bought for a higher price lol
2021-05-13 23:36:55,wallstreetbets,"With GameStop, you just don’t know.

Every retard and their mother here said GameStop was over after the first squeeze and that it would never go above the $40 level it was trading. The 🌈 🐻 even said it was going back down to $10. Everybody was certain given its “fundamentals”. 

Literally a week later it was back at $250+ again.

There is no rhyme or reason when it comes to this stock. It can explode at any time, but I agree, it’s not something I’d risk my retirement money on."
2021-05-14 00:01:34,wallstreetbets,I’ve done an immense amount of DD - and I like the stock. :)
2021-05-14 12:54:28,wallstreetbets,"Don't sit here and act live the value of gme is obvious. Nobody fucking knows. I've heard $10,000 said seriously and $1 said seriously. And it's been up and down several times between $300 and $40.

So don't sit there and act superior like you just knew it wasn't worth $250."
2021-05-14 04:52:05,wallstreetbets,Stop pretending the value of a stock is tied only to the company's profits.
2021-05-14 00:20:44,wallstreetbets,"By diversifying you have a 100% chance of retiring somewhat early.  Your method has a 1% chance of hitting (we’ll forget for now that smoothbrains don’t know when to sell, so it won’t matter) and a 99% chance of you working until death.

You should rethink."
2021-05-14 04:52:40,wallstreetbets,Remember March 10th.
2021-05-14 01:09:20,wallstreetbets,"Well that's good that you did your own DD, and I wish you the best. I have MVIS shares but I'm not expecting anything, definitely not expecting anything short term."
2021-05-14 02:01:44,wallstreetbets,when did this place turn into r/investing?
2021-05-14 00:41:39,wallstreetbets,"🤷🏻‍♀️ too many words- can’t read.

Hehe, kidding, thank you for the concern. I’m pretty confident in my decision thus far.

2021-05-14 01:32:02,wallstreetbets,Stay away from Chinese stocks right now. Far far away. There is a lot more downside in my opinion In all these ADR'S from China.
2021-05-14 00:32:54,wallstreetbets,"I bought at 155 and just dumped all I had, shoulda got out when it hit 300, I'm a dumbass.  Tanked.  Still holding $AMC and $NOK tho.  Still a dumbass."
2021-05-14 16:33:35,wallstreetbets,I thought I missed it last year...I am buying this now..
2021-05-14 00:26:19,wallstreetbets,Cause they sell literal garbage
2021-05-13 21:08:18,wallstreetbets,Fears are overblown. The Chinese government crackdown on monopolies was a slap on the wrist. Jack Ma is fine. Not even close to what Microsoft went through for its monopolistic activities in the US. The US media fear mongering on China is pretty toxic. 19 forward P/E. 64% revenue growth last year and good guidance for this year. Insane growth. EPS miss due to a one time fine by the government.
2021-05-13 20:31:33,wallstreetbets,His post was way too good to be true. definitely glad I read it and promptly forgot about it
2021-05-14 11:19:00,wallstreetbets,He was pretty clear about waiting for an entry.   That DD caught my interest too but I still haven’t made a move because I followed his advice.  Plus the expiry dates he suggested were at least a few months out...so you should have time if you stuck to those suggestions.
2021-05-13 21:25:45,wallstreetbets,Well you know sometimes you lose some and then other times you lose some.
2021-05-14 11:17:55,wallstreetbets,You may be right ! Manage your risk that’s how I trade
2021-05-13 22:19:00,wallstreetbets,This is the same thought I had when i bought 2 10/15 calls when $BABA was at $235 😢
2021-05-14 04:09:27,wallstreetbets,"They missed the adjusted earnings by a bit. The net loss was caused by the fine, though. Cloud growth also missed expectations because they lost one of their biggest customers due to political risk associated with China. E commerce slightly underperformed, although it is hard to say why exactly until we see other Chinese e commerce names report earnings.

That being said, I still think it’s a strong buy at this price."
2021-05-14 11:20:42,wallstreetbets,Yeah I waited but was not patient enough and expected earnings to pop so panicked. Damn earnings!
2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Am I too retarded or not retarded enough?

2021-05-13 20:38:15,wallstreetbets,I'll have to eat a couple crayons to figure this out.
2021-05-14 07:34:32,wallstreetbets,You and I must be working at the same Wendy's. Your portfolio doesn't look all that different from my own...
2021-05-13 20:35:39,wallstreetbets,doesn't one option contract cost $0.65 in e\*trade to open?
2021-05-13 21:28:10,wallstreetbets,You're alright op.  20% loss is honestly nothing for most people to worry about this month (relatively speaking).
2021-05-13 22:06:41,wallstreetbets,My portfolio is in almost exactly the same position as yours.
2021-05-13 22:07:42,wallstreetbets,Thats a whole lotta tickers

2021-05-13 22:47:04,wallstreetbets,"This looks pretty solid to me.  Understand that stocks cycle up and down. Buy Amzn under $3100 and sell $3450+.  I actually think it will cycle back up pretty soon to over $3600. Same with Aapl and others. 

Sure hoping Pltr keeps back over $22 asap."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I love WSB and PLTR PLTR is the first stock I’ve ever bought and it’s the only stock in my portfolio. My position is currently down 32.13% but the loss is not over $10k so no loss porn here haha

I didn’t expect to start off my investing journey this way but if it wasn’t the GME wave on WSB, I wouldn’t even sign up for an online broker or buy any stocks later on. I learned the spirit of putting all available funds in one stock and diamond hands from WSB, also “it’s not a loss if you didn’t sell”. I’m really feelin’ it now

Glad GME is still up there unlike many boomers predicted. Just wanted to say WSB is amazing and we all might be retards in real life but hope everyone’s having some fun along the ride like I did!"
2021-05-13 21:59:03,wallstreetbets,Why does pltr have so many outstanding shares?

2021-05-13 22:33:44,wallstreetbets,Im in at 25.63
2021-05-13 22:36:11,wallstreetbets,Be long on pltr. don’t look at your position until 2025 and you will be rewarded.
2021-05-13 23:56:28,wallstreetbets,Every1 buy PLTR 100$ calls this is financial advice
2021-05-13 21:32:11,wallstreetbets,Burnt down in one day though
2021-05-13 20:28:55,wallstreetbets,People always say this but PLTR already had its day. It literally went to 45 a few months ago. It will take years to get back there unless there is another squeeze.
2021-05-13 21:31:48,wallstreetbets,GME was though
2021-05-14 00:18:29,wallstreetbets,Maybe if the executives stop squeezing the thing for every penny.

You know how a casino is a literal casino?

The market is a casino but instead of being a literal casino it's figurative.

Do you understand now? 

Lmk if it still doesn't make sense and I'll try to explain it a different way for you. 

You know how the casino is a business? That's the stock market. The market is run by for profit private banks who control the market and thus make it. 

Like a casino where you place bets on outcomes out of your control in the market you also place bets on outcomes that are out of control. 

In a casino you have games of chance to bet on. 

In the market you have stocks to bet on. 

The difference is that the casino is an independent third party that enforces the rules IMPARTIALLY and fairly in games players play against other players. 

The government is the house, an independent third party tasked with enforcing the rules, law impartially and fairly in a market where you place bets on companies. 

In a casino the dealer works for the house and is independent of the players with 0 stakes in the game. 

The dealer is the market maker in the market. 

The market maker is also a player though and thus when they deal they deal better hands to themselves, the player, than you their opponent. 

In poker you all get the same information in real time at the same time. 

In the market the dealer shuffles the deck and plays the cards that benefit them as they know all the hands other players hold. 

When you the player call the house over to enforce the rules of the Casino they laugh at you and say ""the dealer is a professional what did you expect?""

Do you understand now? 

The market is a casino.

The casino is a casino. 

You have better odds in a casino than you do in the market. 

Lmk if you still can't understand that the market is a casino and all the games are rigged against you. The games are operated by the players you bet against as they are the dealer and control which cards get played when etc. 

Hopefully you understand now. 

Invest in SPY as you can't beat the market. 

Why can't you best the market? Because it's rigged silly. 

When the casino loses too much they can ban you from playing. 

When the market makers lose too much they can ban you from playing, like they did.

You called the house over to instruct the dealer to play fairly and the house laughed at you. 

Hope this helps you understand how the figurative casino is like the literal casino only literal casinos are fair and impartial. 😘"

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"V2G, a Long-term EV Energy Infrastructure Play # About the Grid and V2G

Like any other commodity, the price of electricity constantly fluctuates in accordance with supply and demand. However, unlike most commodities, electricity is not cheaply storable. This causes a huge inefficiency for electricity providers because they must develop enough power plants to meet peak power demand. Building new power plants is incredibly capital intensive and a poor use of capital if those plants are only needed for a few hours per day, week, or month during high load events. Instead, utilities are incentivized to ""flatten the curve"" of electricity demand and keep their capital investment in new power plants low. Historically, prices to consumers have been fixed with time of day fluctuations built into the calculation, but smart meters and deregulation have led to more states offering real-time pricing. [source](https://extension.psu.edu/real-time-pricing-for-electricity). This creates opportunity.

It's a load balancing problem. Power plants can supply all the necessary power if demand is spread uniformly, but when everyone wants that power from 4PM-8PM on a hot summer day, it's a problem and black-outs occur.

Enter V2G. Why let any asset sit idle when it could be making you money? Rather than turning your EV into a robo-taxi when you're not using it, here's a simpler idea: leverage the most valuable component of the EV, the battery. Grid operators will pay to rent your energy storage and use your car's battery as a ""virtual power plant"" to meet peak demand.

# The future of the grid

Green energy like solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of electricity generation in most parts of the world ([Bloomberg 2019 Energy Outlook](https://www.enelgreenpower.com/media/news/2019/07/bloomberg-new-energy-outlook-2019)). Yet, passive green energy generation varies depending on conditions and cannot respond to greater demand like a traditional power station. Additionally, electricity demand will continue to grow with the population and EV ownership. By 2035, an estimated 50% of ALL cars will be electric ([Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ninety-percent-of-u-s-cars-must-be-electric-by-2050-to-meet-climate-goals/)). Adding more battery storage to the grid is part of the solution.

# Hurdles

**Plug problems**

There are 2 dominant fast charging plugs used for EV's: CHADeMO and CCS (adapters between the two are not possible). In North America and Europe, CCS has become and will continue to be the  standard, but it does not yet support bidirectional charging which is projected for 2025 ([Inside EVs](https://insideevs.com/news/342354/charin-ccs-combo-standard-to-offer-v2g-by-2025/)).

CHADeMO does support bidrectional charging and has decent coverage across the globe, but it's dying everywhere outside of Japan. There are a couple mass market CHADeMO vehicles on the market, notably the Nissan Leaf, but it's difficult for people to justify buying V2G equipment right now because changing from a CHADeMO to CCS vehicle would render the V2G equipment useless.

Tesla. In the US, Tesla uses a proprietary plug for fast-charging instead of the CCS standard they have shifted towards in most other markets. Tesla is the single largest EV maker, so their proprietary plug poses problems for a V2G future. Tesla would need to be willing to enable bidirectional charging on their fleet and potentially canabilize their Powerwall business.

**Battery degradation.**

All studies I've seen suggest this is minimal ([source](https://youtu.be/QKg_GWDogFc?t=420)). Advancing technology in accordance with Wright's law ([source](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/electric-vehicle-battery-prices-fall/)) should bring larger, cheaper, more resilient batteries, so long-term, I do not expect this to be an issue.

**Battery capacity and user error**

Let's say you're a 9-5 wage slave. You plug in your vehicle at 5:30 and it starts powering your house to offset peak power prices. But, a couple hours later you decide you want to go out only to discover your vehicle has lost 10+ kWH powering your house. Obviously, this defeats the purpose of such a system. There are 2 solutions to this.

1. Press a button on the V2G equipment that will keep your car charging instead of discharging on days when you may go out.
2. Get a car with a large enough battery that it practically has no effect. If your car doubles as a home battery backup, it makes sense to spend the extra money on this and benefit from the greater range. It's beautiful - wait for it - synergy.

**Regulation**

Back in 2016, Tesla's chief technology office said battery degradation and regulation were the 2 largest risks ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzAPyk8Wbhk&t=219s)). I don't disagree about regulation. This is where V2H makes a lot of sense. Getting permission from numerous different regulatory agencies sounds like a bureaucratic nightmare.

It's feasible because it's essentially the same scenario as someone with solar panels that feed back into the grid. Yet, we still see nightmare cases like Bill Maher who waited over 1,000 days to get regulatory approval for solar panels.

Fortunately, V2H is plenty profitable and should require less regulation since you would not feed power back into the grid. I plugged in my own home energy usage and found I could decrease my ""capacity charge"" on my electric bill from $50/month to $0/month if my vehicle powers my house everyday from 4-6 PM during typical peak demand and then recharge late at night using practically free electricity.

# Conclusion

At present, EV buyers are generally wealthier and more educated. So, they are likely to adopt V2G/V2H because the math works out. It's a low risk investment with consistent returns via savings on energy bills. The only issue? There's no V2G product available on the US market, yet. You want to extract as much value from a depreciating asset like a vehicle as fast as possible because advancing technology makes your vehicle more obsolete everyday. If battery degradation is minimal, as evidence suggests, then it's only logical to enroll your vehicle into V2G and extract maximum value from it with minimal inconvenience.

CHADeMO vehicles have served as the guinea pigs. They have shown the feasibility of V2G. Utilities have partnered with private companies even with residential customers ([residential experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7h9EecmLatY&)). Now, it's a matter of waiting for CCS to achieve bidirectional charging, waiting for enough vehicles to proliferate, and then the V2G payday will come.

2021-05-13 21:39:15,wallstreetbets,1000 at 14....
2021-05-13 21:25:44,wallstreetbets,"I bough at the top. averaging down. still buying calls. still hopeful but... im down, a lot"
2021-05-13 21:59:03,wallstreetbets,They only had it for about a month you might be looking at the air bag inflator residue.
2021-05-14 00:19:47,wallstreetbets,I told you degenerates it’s smart to be bullish on BB!
2021-05-14 01:09:29,wallstreetbets,"My BB is 41.5% down, so no reason for me to sell until the price at least doubles, or even triples. 💎🙌😎"
2021-05-14 01:38:28,wallstreetbets,Never thought BB would drop this low ever again. Man was that the worst call I ever made… do not even get me started on Rocket.
2021-05-13 21:46:40,wallstreetbets,"Guys I am the ape of century, bought 130 blackberry at 26$ and sold it at 9$ 😑"
2021-05-13 21:21:27,wallstreetbets,"No matter what positive news that comes  out which is often, it still tanks like someone has a finger on it maybe shitadell"
2021-05-13 21:57:52,wallstreetbets,"Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice. The more I buy the more it takes a deuce"
2021-05-13 23:11:20,wallstreetbets,"Typical CTO: ""that sounds good but we have iPhones here so we can't use it."" Sometimes I feel like they really should have kept the name Research in Motion instead of Blackberry, or go with something completely different."
2021-05-13 23:15:37,wallstreetbets,"4500 shares, going 5k shares shortly. Not expecting much this year"
2021-05-14 00:58:59,wallstreetbets,I sold today for more GME and AMC so thank me when it goes up.
2021-05-14 08:33:15,wallstreetbets,"1316 @ 9.31 plus around $1200 in various calls, got a few cash secured puts sitting near the money, might get those shares and lower average a bit."
2021-05-14 08:55:53,wallstreetbets,This is like being mentally retarded and claiming you've never lost a fight - no one is going to throw fists at you to begin with.
2021-05-14 17:32:56,wallstreetbets,"I sell at 28 and rebuy 100K$ at 11, very confortable for the long terme, 2023 at 50 if not 100, the margin in the software space are very good and they will be well position in the cybersecury and autonomus vehicule"
2021-05-13 21:23:31,wallstreetbets,Its not dropping its just on sale
2021-05-14 02:41:25,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-13 23:47:30,wallstreetbets,"No, it’s a 5$ stock - it’ll correct eventually"
2021-05-14 01:45:04,wallstreetbets,I too have developed floppy tits from another ticker.
2021-05-13 21:37:56,wallstreetbets,"It is so cheap, time to buy calls"
2021-05-13 21:50:19,wallstreetbets,"Honestly they just need a decent performance.  If they post a profit at any time its GG. Stock will go to $20 in a day.  But until then, its just gonna bleed."
2021-05-13 21:29:23,wallstreetbets,no it only works one way. you only have the power to tank a stock
2021-05-14 02:36:10,wallstreetbets,If they partnered with tesla they'd probably still go down
2021-05-13 21:50:47,wallstreetbets,Sold 35x 10p.  Guess i'm in for 3500 shares.
2021-05-13 20:37:54,wallstreetbets,Whut
2021-05-14 02:15:13,wallstreetbets,Buy stocks in companies that you believe in and pay for. How many you apes have a blackberry?! AMC is the way
2021-05-13 22:44:10,wallstreetbets,"2k shares at 19 baby, well be ok"
2021-05-13 23:04:07,wallstreetbets,"55% here, I feel your pain."
2021-05-14 00:17:13,wallstreetbets,"u/woojo1984, don't my friend, everything will be okay. I used to lose my money at the tit's bar (teetees bar); now, everything is closed, I find the same thrill and thrust @ loss $BB"
2021-05-13 22:25:52,wallstreetbets,It will hit 5.87 then back up to 25 and more..it could possibly hit 3.48 but the lower it goes DO NOT sell it will come back up
2021-05-14 02:28:59,wallstreetbets,61% here
2021-05-14 09:56:20,wallstreetbets,Checking in at 55% as well brother ape
2021-05-14 00:09:57,wallstreetbets,"u/mattlamattla, you don't lose until you sell. Hold and be patient; the market rewards those who are patient!"
2021-05-13 21:58:28,wallstreetbets,huh?
2021-05-13 23:49:07,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nbwzdr/blackberry_bb_ivys_customer_base_revealed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf     ..you think it’s a $5 stock? I suggest you read this
2021-05-14 14:32:37,wallstreetbets,"With these markets, I’m sure there are a lot of floppy tits out there. I know I’m upside down in lucid, pltr, bb, and a bunch of other random calls"
2021-05-13 21:55:45,wallstreetbets,You’re gonna be a rich man in the year 3000
2021-05-14 06:08:20,wallstreetbets,I imagine there's a decent chance that quite a few actually *do* have Blackberry in their cars.
2021-05-13 23:04:48,wallstreetbets,Don’t shame her!
2021-05-13 21:27:02,wallstreetbets,"I was down about that much, but do to the power of averaging down im now only down 43%"
2021-05-13 23:56:28,wallstreetbets,"For your sake I hope I’m wrong...

Check my comment history on BB - been pretty close to the company for a very long time and don’t have the same optimism.

All in I just don’t think the upside warrants the risk (Nevermind how long your $$ will be stuck in a stock trading sideways / slowly depreciating while you wait to see if it does rally)"
2021-05-14 09:47:01,wallstreetbets,"That's a really low tier DD. They're obviously already trying to sell in - that's not new news, all companies try to sell their product/service. When they start actually talking about who's signed up, to what extent, the potential profits, that's real news.

As that comment section mentioned - Spark/Radar had ""early access"" users, and didn't have customers on launch. Many OEMs / Tier1s will take the sales pitches, but agree to buy something is an entirely different ball game."
2021-05-13 20:07:38,wallstreetbets,"100 @ 12.88

Doubled down with another 100 @ 8.75.

I deserve it."
2021-05-14 00:04:30,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. And for the record, from the point at which I first invested to this moment, I haven’t been very optimistic myself given a variety of reasons. Until now. I will check out some of your comments I value learning from different perspectives"
2021-05-13 20:11:53,wallstreetbets,"3@14.59. I’ve only been actively trading since January, but it’s the only thing in my portfolio that has yet to see anything but red."

2021-05-14 06:01:02,wallstreetbets,"They weren't doing that to begin with, just the lower-quality and duplicate posts.

But they figured that people *want* them. So for now they're here."

2021-05-13 20:33:25,wallstreetbets,WSB always hates GME and AMC until it squeezes because the mods are all bought out

2021-05-14 00:50:23,wallstreetbets,Preying on your downfall. Celebrate the rise
2021-05-14 00:52:09,wallstreetbets,"So at one point today this call was worth $3.25. 
How and why did you not sell ?"
2021-05-14 02:31:25,wallstreetbets,"You got lucky, congrats fucker. No way I’d lay $3k on a bet like that. Ever."
2021-05-14 02:45:31,wallstreetbets,I wonder who could be the downvoters. Probably nothing to do with the sub being blatantly compromised.
2021-05-14 03:53:19,wallstreetbets,Boner alert!
2021-05-14 04:00:02,wallstreetbets,"It says unrealized... you did sell it, right? Lol"

2021-05-14 18:50:40,wallstreetbets,The real question: did you realize at underlying 14 or 12.85
2021-05-14 01:20:15,wallstreetbets,I’ll fuckin down vote you again
2021-05-13 20:10:33,wallstreetbets,"A bit new to option call, but if he closed all 50 contracts does that counts as a PDT? or would that be one whole transaction and count as only one trade?"
2021-05-13 21:44:41,wallstreetbets,Inverse WSB has always been a classic play
2021-05-13 21:35:03,wallstreetbets,"Preach, some 🌈🐻 told me to sell my SPY 500c 1/21/22 hahahahahahahahaha"

2021-05-14 14:15:11,wallstreetbets,Bruh the contract expires in a day. Who’s the real retard here
2021-05-14 09:30:27,wallstreetbets,I hope this is a fucking joke
2021-05-14 08:09:24,wallstreetbets,InvestorLine cousins!
2021-05-13 23:44:51,wallstreetbets,"....yet

2021-05-14 09:14:34,wallstreetbets,"Blind squirrel here, can confirm. I found a butt once."
2021-05-13 23:48:27,wallstreetbets,Id be proud of winning even though it definitely was a coin toss. DD doesnt mean jack shit in 2021
2021-05-14 01:00:25,wallstreetbets,Bro. Did you see the strike price? Fuck that!
2021-05-14 00:51:47,wallstreetbets,He bought them over a week ago. PDT only happens if you open a position and close it the same day ON MARGIN. Closing a cash position in the same day is not a pattern day trade.
2021-05-13 20:29:52,wallstreetbets,Fuko degraduloto
2021-05-14 04:01:12,wallstreetbets,Are you buying puts on gme and amc then?
2021-05-14 04:32:14,wallstreetbets,"That's not what a 🌈🐻 would say. A 🌈🐻 would say something like ""I'm happy SPY went up so I can buy puts, get fucked and lose all my money""."
2021-05-14 08:40:04,wallstreetbets,I too think trading the calls for shares would be smart.
2021-05-14 03:07:00,wallstreetbets,"(no one does some people just like to act like they do, probs gonna squeeze hard tho right?)"
2021-05-13 20:26:41,wallstreetbets,Thx 🥰
2021-05-14 01:01:25,wallstreetbets,"ahhhh okay, gotcha.  
Let's say hypothetically he bought all 50 of those contract today and then wanted to sell all 50 of those same exact contracts on the same day. That would be considered PDT correct?"
2021-05-14 04:11:39,wallstreetbets,"No idea how you came to that conclusion but not at the moment, no."
2021-05-14 08:38:22,wallstreetbets,How high before buying puts on amc?
2021-05-14 09:19:35,wallstreetbets,So you just have 50k lying around?
2021-05-14 02:51:58,wallstreetbets,Looool ok
2021-05-14 02:19:02,wallstreetbets,Only if he's trading on MARGIN. If it's a cash account it doesn't matter.
2021-05-14 02:50:15,wallstreetbets,"I would imagine PDT is by number of transactions. If he bought/sold each one individually then that’d be 50 transactions, but he could sell all of it in one transaction."
2021-05-14 10:29:33,wallstreetbets,You don't?
2021-05-14 10:30:44,wallstreetbets,Also he can still sell the call to someone else who will buy the shares tomorrow still. think of it as a coupon for 100 shares.
2021-05-14 09:55:22,wallstreetbets,"Oh okay, thank you guys for the info! much love <3"

It’s expected that our inflation would rise after the recent major spending due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Some could brush it off, others worry their asses off but let’s take a look at our history. We’ve been in a bull market the past 10 years, gotten a pretty good ride since the most major recession and we’re long overdue for a bear market. I think the past two days are a significant *red* herring that we’re going to experience some trouble. I’m no expert, but I think it’d be wise to either hold off or double down on the degenerate gambling. Thoughts apes?"

I would actually look at retail and other recover stocks that are sitting at ATH.  WSM and RH are great examples.  Way over valued. They went straight up the last 4 months. WSM literally went up 90%. Already have Puts on both. RH up like 65% and WSH up 12% today."

2021-05-13 23:00:07,wallstreetbets,"The stocks are no where near where they were pre covid. They can go down a lot more before going up. Pltr was $9 a year ago and is $18 right now, it can easily see $15-$13 soon in the short term. I have a small position in it, my major put was in roblox and MVIS."
2021-05-14 00:24:44,wallstreetbets,"Fair value of Pltr is about $22. We are already getting down into a liquidation valuenof cash and assets right now.

Many of the tech companies have valid financials to support a higher valuation.  Amd for example increased yoy Q1 revenue 93% and profit over 180% yet the price is low $70s.  They are eating Intc lunch in consumer products and data centers and starting to get into Nvda space with GPUs etc."
2021-05-14 07:36:23,wallstreetbets,"Given all the SBC the company hands out alongside options/warrants exercisable, lots of dilution available in the company. 

300 million in exercisable stock options ITM 
535 million available 

Obviously using the treasury stock method reduces those numbers, but doubt that inflow of cash will have Palantir doing buybacks."
2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"An honest question with reasons below. Why is anyone supporting AMC? The effort to stick it to the hedge funds was a great cause especially for GME but WSB's purpose for AMC is one that allowed execs from AMC to take clear advantage of everyone on WSB. 

In February, AMC top executives took bonuses of $8.3 million (literally for carrying them through the pandemic, which is interesting because they shutdown operations and made near zero income. Zero! So exactly how did they carry the company through the pandemic?). Yet WSB comes along and catapults the stock value so now these clowns are worthy of million dollar bonuses? This is no different than the banks taking TARP $ in 2008-09 and were instructed by the Fed to loan $ out to consumers but instead paid massive bonuses to themselves. Doesn't any of this anger anyone? It does me, I'm seriously pissed. 

Don't believe me, check it out: 

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amc-entertainment-awards-ceo-adam-aron-3-75m-bonus 

Even worse, NOW executive compensation has exploded. When movie theaters closed in March 2020 as the coronavirus took hold, AMC’s top executives including Aron agreed to cut their cash salary by 15% and decrease other compensation over three years (which is noble) in exchange for stock that will only vest if the price doubles or triples. (Uh, that would be fair if they championed the turnaround in the stock, which they didn't do, WSB did). 

See how that worked out? WSB saved the company (which is great because going to the movies is practically a need in life along with food, shelter and clothing). But again, the executives had zero involvement with the performance of the stock, ZERO. WSB is what championed this turnaround making the executive compensation pathetic.  So now what? Sell? Hold or something else? Either way, why was this company supported from the beginning?

2021-05-14 04:36:47,wallstreetbets,"account made on march 19th 2021, get out of here you spy"
2021-05-14 02:11:19,wallstreetbets,"Back in march earnings calls. It was reported that only 1-5% of what the cash they received was from the stock price.

I wouldn't call a stock that's been at around 10 dollars a stock that ""soared"". Gme is the one that soared. AMC is still currently undervalued compared to pre 2020 levels. 

But all this doesn't matter, I'm personally not investing in AMC because of business practices. I'm here for the squeeze. Don't really care how they use the money."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$AMD is undervalued and will steadily grow to $100+ by Q4. Tech sector ie (QQQ) was among the best performing index’s for the past decade and covid only accelerated that sentiment. That sentiment will likely continue due to younger money growing with time. 

Micro Chips are needed more than ever. Ie Autos, Cloud, Block chain, Energy. 

AMDs big shift (2017) was to outsource foundry and bring in Taiwan base wafers which is highlighted as AMDs biggest successful move. 

AMD has commented in the latest ER that the chip shortage in the media is not going to affect their output. They have the strongest relationship with TSM and internally Lisa Su knows she will have dibs. This is a key foundation for AMD which is affecting two of their biggest lines (profit margin via cheap chips, and capacity not being affected as TSM is going to ship as many chips as AMD needs)

AMD has grown in double digits for the past 3 years. Ie QoQ growth, YoY growth, further, gross profit remains intact and will likely not change as TSM is their horse. Every earnings forecast is revised up. Expecting more double digit growth for the foreseeable future. 

With AMD stock price going down, current PE stands at ~30. This is very low for any tech sector stock, especially one that is expecting large growth in an industry that will only grow. PE will continue to drop if AMD stays flat or drops in stock price. They will continue to grow revenue exponentially which will also cause PE to drop."

Their big successful move in 2017 was in the release of their clean sheet, next gen chip (Zen). They've been fabless for a while.

2021-05-13 20:38:53,wallstreetbets,"as a lifelong intel fan, i went ahead and went with an AMD last year. i got a 3700x because i was cooling it with a l9a in a Dan case so i wasnt expecting much, but it was a shit cpu. since i have the x570 mobo i got the 5800x and oh boy that thing runs hotter than a fucking toaster. soon i will get the coveted 5900x and if that shit doesnt match the hype, AMD is still AMD in my book. and Rdna2 and SAM bullshit is some cuckery."

2021-05-13 21:56:52,wallstreetbets,"You need big air or a 240mm aio for 5800x and above. They seem to base their max clock speeds off of a 70c temp. Also find the negative offset in curve optimizer for your particular chip. That will reduce temps and increase clock speeds. My 5600x runs the coolest at around 60c under a 240 aio in a cooler master nr200p case. 5800x was toasty with peaks up to 80c under a 240 aio and no curve optimization. Replaced it with a 5900x that runs around 70c under a 360 aio while rendering with a -10 offset on the curve optimizer. Clock speeds are at 4.3ghz all core. While gaming with same settings, my temps are about 60-65c but it boosts to 4.75ghz all core with peaks of 5.15ghz. 

If you want set and forget, go intel. If you like to tweak and tune, go amd. Hope that helps"

2021-05-13 22:03:46,wallstreetbets,Should be plenty of cooling capability then. I postulate the reason that the 5800x runs so hot is because all 8 cores on the ccd are active compared to just 6 on the ccd's of the 5600x or 5900x. I wonder if the same heat is generated by the 5950x for the same reason. I'll have to ask my buddy what his temps are on his sometime

2021-05-13 22:00:21,wallstreetbets,While this can be true they’ll run this market down even lower since most stocks are bought on margin and over valued. Theyll make more money is what im saying
2021-05-13 20:04:05,wallstreetbets,"To overly simplify it. A calls premium goes up in value if the underlying asset increases in value and if the Implied Volatility or IV goes up then it increases in value even more. 

A call gives you the right to buy 100 shares per contract purchased at the strike price by a certain date. Once the date is reached, then the call is automatically exercised or sold (if you don’t have the funds to purchase 100 shares of the underlying asset). Most people never exercise calls though, and instead choose to “buy to close” to either realize a profit or stop a loss before the expiration date.

A put gives you the right to sell 100 shares of a stock at the strike price by the date specified in the contract. Everything above applies to a put except that a puts premium goes up in value if the underlying asset decreases in value. 

Buying a put is NOT shorting a stock.

Options are actually quite complicated too. They decrease in value over time due to Theta and the rate of decay increases tenfold as the expiration date approaches. I would suggest not trading options until you do some of your own research and then give it a go with a dollar amount you are OK with losing before you try it out. 

You can realize massive gains with options; however, it is also much easier to lose all your money trading them too. With stocks, you can hold them forever and most likely it will eventually be profitable. Options do not have this luxury. They can expire out of the money completely worthless and leave you penniless on the trade"

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Redfin (RDFN) Severely Undervalued with Great Catalysts Hello Fellow Autists,

The residential real estate market is booming. REITS are too boomer for you, so you look for growth plays to play real estate. Redfin (RDFN) is a play that is greatly undervalued.  

**What is Redfin?** Redfin is a residential real estate brokerage. The company uses technologies such as map search and virtual house showings to increase exposure, improve the quality of the customer experience, all while delivering efficiencies and saving the consumer costs. Redfin also provides the ability to do digital and online document management making it a one stop shop for one’s real estate needs. **Their mission is to redefine real estate in favor of the consumer. To change an industry that has had little disruption. Redfin's business model to undercut competition is based on sellers paying Redfin a discounted fee, either 1 or 1.5% to list the seller's home.**  

This company does it all, they will buy your house, sell your house, you can buy a house on it, get approved for a mortgage, get a mortgage, or even hire a concierge service to get your home ready for people to view it in person or online. Your wife's boyfriend can take care of all his real estate needs and finally get you a house to you don't have to ask him if you can turn on the AC at night. Think of this company as a potential amazon of real estate and nobody does what they do.

https://preview.redd.it/dh2x14z91xy61.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d864509782271001b5de5c5d29c7eaf3dd814c

In the past few years Redfin has had crazy growth, in 2019 alone they had over 60% revenue growth and during the quarter of COVID lockdowns they sustained over 4% growth compared to that quarter last year which is crazy because everybody was under lockdown. 

&#x200B;

Recently the company lost over 30% of its share value after earnings per share miss (They beat revenue estimates) and the Nasdaq brutality that has happened lately. They are currently trading at around 49-50 dollars a share as I write this, which is about a 5 billion dollar market cap. They are projected to have well over 5 billion dollars in revenue alone and be profitable in 2025. They will be profitable by end of 2021. This is a company that recently in 2016 only had about .33% of all the homes sold in North America, and now they have over 1% and growth will be exponential as they acquire more listing through their catalysts. I did a DCF analysis and the perpetuity approach price value of the stock using slightly bullish over consensus numbers was around 95$ per share. With sensitivity analysis the best case is around 150$ per share.  

**The investment thesis:** Redfin will trade higher through the catalysts of **surging real estate prices** due to people moving out of cities due to Covid, inflation, interest rates, and the general economy booming right now, the **acquisition of Rentpath**, and the **expansion of RedfinNow program**. Plus the company right now is way undervalued and is a steal. 

Real Estate Industry Outlook: 

 In 2020, Redfin accounted for 1.00% of total home sales, leaving much more room for redfin to acquire market share 

• 8% estimate rise in real estate sales in 2021, which will benefit Redfin’s business

• As home prices rise, the profits for Redfin rise as well

• During 2020, revenue in the real estate market hit $33.6 trillion

• Over the last 10 years, mortgage rates have declined by \~2.42%, benefiting residential real estate

Essentially real estate is booming, and Redfin was already in hyper growth mode before COVID. 

&#x200B;

**Expansion of RedfinNow**

This is a newer program and they are committed to growing it recently adding San Francisco to territory this program exists. RedfinNow is a great way to liquidate your home with a cash offer from Redfin. You get a no-obligation offer in a few days. Close on your schedule, and move when you're ready. This is helping them get more listings because in this industry more listings makes you get more views and Redfin is already the most visited online brokerage by a lot. This will add to their exponential growth of their business and as long as they buy the houses for dirt cheap they will also churn out good profit on them. This is their number one growing segment of revenue.

&#x200B;

**Acquisition of Rentpath** 

In February, Redfin moved into the rental industry, acquiring RentPath for $608 Million.

\-RentPath has more than 20,000 apartment buildings on its rental websites, and grew its traffic more than 25% last year

\-One in five  of Redfin’s 40+ million monthly visitors also wants to see homes for rent

\-Redfin plans to have all of Rentpath’s listing on their own website by 2022, the partnership will allow for: 

\- Better Search Experience

\- Better Value for Advertisers

\-Higher Traffic Growth

\-And open up to a younger customer base as many younger people want to see rentals because they are not in a position to buy a house whether it be because of finances, job, etc. 

&#x200B;

**Summarization:** Redfin is extremely undervalued where it is at right now and is a steal. The company has no competitor that does what they do. Zillow only makes its money from advertising while Redfin has all sorts of revenue segments that are diverse. The real estate market outlook that has been brought on by Covid took this already crazy growth company pulled it back a little in a slingshot and let it rip. Throw in RedfinNow and Rentpath and this company is going to be a terror for other companies to deal with. This is a great long term play and longer dated call options are going to be great. At the end of the day redfin is a company for the consumer and saves them lots of money while they make money. you can save up to 40k selling a million dollar house on their website. That's a lot of money to use on some  FD's.

2021-05-13 23:06:35,wallstreetbets,"Although until now I hadn't considered their stock, I do like the Redfin model. They're a disruptor in an otherwise stale Real Estate industry. I'm actually surprised they haven't made more inroads, but the current model with it's mostly 6% commission structure is closely guarded by the old school gatekeepers (and their lobby)."
2021-05-14 01:34:44,wallstreetbets,"I've used Redfin since the beginning and they easily have the best site for shopping and researching homes. The problem is that every single one of their agent referrals over the past 10 years have tried to steer me away from using Redfin (for what I assume a better commission percentage), and that is a business development failure on Redfin's part and leads to lack of monetization.  I spend 100X more time on Redfin than Zillow, have tried to exclusively use Redfin, yet their ""partners"" continue to backstab them. They need to fix that."

2021-05-14 09:40:34,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea how to play options, care to explain in more detail 👀?"
2021-05-14 12:48:21,wallstreetbets,"There are a lot of ways to play options.  Selling covered calls is one of the least risky, but it can print money over the long term.

A call is a contract between the seller and the buyer, where up until an agreed upon date (expiration date), the buyer has the right / option to buy 100 shares of the stock from the seller at an agreed upon price (strike price).  A covered call is just a call where the seller of the contract is already holding the shares to meet their obligation should the buyer exercise the contract.

When you see what you think is an undervalued stock, a simple way to try to make money off of it is to buy it and set a limit sell for it to be sold when it reaches a price you think it should be at.

A way to potentially make more money is to buy the stock and sell weekly calls on it (option contracts that expire after one week, shortest term available) with the strike price being what you would have set for your limit sell.  That way you make exactly as much money as you would have just selling the stock at that limit price, but also whatever you happen to collect in premiums for selling call contracts on the shares in the time it takes the stock to reach that price.

Using UWMC as an example, one could buy and hold 100 shares and sell weekly $9 calls for something like $0.10/share, or $10/contract.  That doesn't sound like much, but it adds up, and when the stock reaches $9 and your call contract gets exercised by the buyer, you still take all of those gains up to the strike price as profits.

And consider this:  UWMC is considered to have a decent dividend for it's share price at $0.40/year, which is paid out as $0.10 each quarter (every 3 months).  Selling covered calls for $0.10/share pays you that dividend every week."

Actually, I think there still may be truth to the post. Maybe HF's are hiding SI, maybe my initial date was off and we are still prime for a squeeze soon.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But this post is not about gamestop. I am writing this post to answer a question that melvins bot asked me: How the actual fuck do you make money trading options and you don't know what ""writing a put"" means?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Well I do know what writing a put means, but I believe the newbies of WSB would like to hear my answer.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How do you make money in the stock market if you aren't a financial professional? The answer is simple: The Long/Short Portfolio

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What is Long/Short? The premise of a long/short portfolio is to be prepared for anything that could happen in the market. Even the best traders in the world can't guess and time every single economic event. The goal of the long/short is to have a portfolio set up that can make money in any market. The most basic long/short combination is SPY/VIX. If you compare the charts, they are pretty much exact inverses of each other. Because of this, you can protect yourself against a market crash.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To give an example of how I use the SPY/VIX, I had spy investments that were up 25% around the 13th of april. My belief is that gamestop will squeeze soon, and when it does, the rest of the market will sell off. To act on this belief, I pulled most of my gains out of the spy and slightly increased my position in the VIX. This ""reaction"" can be triggered by your personal beliefs in the market, gamestop was just an example. If you only purchase the vix when it is near an all time low, and never purchase the spy at an all time high, you will have a foolproof hedge\* Not to mention, the vix does not just pop on devastating market events. Normal corrections can be profited from through the vix. As you can see, this set up is made for protection. For example, if you were invested in the VIX and S&P before the covid crash, your vix investment would have increased just as much as your spy decreased. If you sold your vix, and waited a year, your spy would be back to it's previous value, and you would pocket the profit from the vix.

\*Foolproof as in one investment will hedge the other. A 50/50 vix spy split will not be profitable.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There are many ways to set up a long/short portfolio. SPY/VIX is the simplest, and probably the least profitable because it is created for this very reason. Perhaps an investor could find cyclical stocks that benefit from the others loss, and use that as a long/short. It's also possible to find cyclical stocks that are at a very low price, and hedge with more mainstream investments/tools, just like a certain DFV. It's ok to gamble on meme stocks as long as your portfolio has a long/short backbone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All in all, it is not possible to guess everything that will happen. So how do good traders make money even if they don't understand the exact intricacies and implications of options, or even economic functions in general? Long/short. They don't know everything. They just use the tools available to them to be prepared for everything.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok cool lots of talk about strategy but this is WSB and you're here for options. So how do you use long/short with options? Invest the exact same way a boomer would, but with leaps. What is the difference between parking your spare cash in S&P shares vs S&P leap calls for 2 years? If you are an active investor, there is no difference in risk. I would

argue that through periodic vix investments, it is even less risky then letting your cash sit in shares. The benefit is that the return of the leap S&P options will return much more profit then the shares.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: I'm not responsible for any money you lose. And please, if you don't know options, research a lot before playing with them. From personal experience, it is very very easy to lose money. If you want to practice the long/short, use SPY/VIXY shares for a safer start. If you are new to investing in general, paper trade first.  This is my own approach to the market. I am sharing it because I got my start in the market through WSB. This sub has cycles. It's normal for awhile, then a post hits the front page and there's a huge influx of noobs. Eventually, the words of the OGs get through to the noobs, and they learn the game. I think this new cycle has brought more newbies then the OGs can keep up with. So here's my advice, take it or leave it

2021-05-13 23:34:00,wallstreetbets,"Well, I started trading at the age of 16. I lost 100k my first year, then recovered that the next year. The loss taught me everything I had to learn. Experience is the best teacher. I know you won't like hearing this but losses are the only way you will learn. It doesn't have to be as big as mine but if you're reading news 24/7, good at economics, excellent at reading patterns, competent with your technical analysis and ready to lose money, you'll make a great trader. Trading is an art that gets perfected over time. The day I started looking at money as just ""numbers"" and not something that can buy me things, I stopped making net losses. Psychology plays a colossal role. Avoid leveraging too much, it will be the death of you.

Also, never revenge trade. It was my biggest lesson. I wish I had more to give you but it is as simple as that. Sometimes the best way is the simplest.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PLTR: Two Huge Catalysts That No One is Talking About (DD) Credit to r/Ryanj928

Okay listen up Palantards. Within the next two weeks, we have the potential to see two contracts being awarded to Palantir that most likely will have bring in roughly $750 million or more to Palantir's total deal value. THIS IS HUGE! As of Q1 2021, Palantir's total deal value was $2.8 billion, so this potential deal value of $750 million would be 26.8% of Palantir's total deal value. This type of news brings further shock to the growth that Palantir is experiencing, and with their margins only getting better, this will drastically improve the cash flow of this company.

​

So what are the Catalysts?

1:) The FDIC's Rapid Phased Prototyping Competition - This competition was started in August of 2020 when the FDIC formally invited 33 companies to submit a concept that would help update the old, cumbersome software that FDIC banks were using to report information, financial risks, integrate data; All on a cloud-based platform that ultimately will host end-to-end supervision processes. Exactly what Palantir does. This competition has been ongoing, and Palantir, unsurprisingly, was selected as 1 out of the 11 finalists for the competition. These companies presented their last demo days in March, and one company is expected to get the contract that could run 7.5 years and total up to $487.5 million. This contract can be expanded into additional work, and could generate more revenue if Palantir is awarded the contract. Based off the FDIC's timeline for the RPP competition, it seems they are expecting to make a decision before the end of the month, since the competitors showed their final prototype back in mid-March and the timeline has been moving in two month intervals.

​

2:) The Renewal of the U.S. Special Operations Command Contract - This was previously Palantir's largest ever contract before the U.S Army contract in 2019. This contract was valued $277,500,00 and was a 5 year contract that was awarded in 2016 that is set to expire on May 25th. Based off Palantir's reputation in the DoD, its reasonable to say that Palantir is the best competitor for this project and will most likely be given a renewal contract by the U.S Special Ops Command. This renewal will most likely be a larger contract, due to natural COG rising and potential to be involved in other areas of software for the agency. But this contract will certainly be announced on/before May 25th and will be a huge number for investors to read. Although this is just a renewal, this is a HUGE renewal, one of their largest ever.

​

Conclusion: These two catalysts will provide a strong argument to showcase Palantir's dominance in data analytics, and show itself as the only competitor capable of handling data safely and efficiently in the world. I strongly believe that these two catalysts will be huge momentum for the company itself (not just the stock) and will further confirm our eventual destination to the moon. With Palantir finally getting passed the profitability marker, deals like this will cement that profitability and hurl it from being branded as an unprofitable, 17 year old company to one that is quickly increasing cash flow by the multiple. Those who are value traders/professionals and use models, you understand how this will change the stock price. This will be a once in a decade company and I fully am behind it.

My models currently show a $29 PT, but this number will greatly change within the next quarter, especially when inflation fears reside."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NRG Energy - a value trade with good fundamental and technical delta. NRG Energy ($NRG) – A utility with millions of customers and a stupid cheap price to forward P/E of 5.82 and an even juicier price to free-cash-flow of 5.63. They also pay a 1.30 annual dividend which works out to 3.87%. In addition, every year since 2017 they have reduced their share count with buybacks,

NRG Energy is a very profitably utility that faced headwinds following their acquisition of Direct Energy which was involved in the winter storm that locked up a lot of Texas’s green energy sector. (Impact of it was $550 million.) This is minor in the scale of NRG’s revenue and their annual free-cash-flow.

Recent distribution of the stock has hit a point where I think the selling pressure is off. It has spent the last two weeks in a down-trend to based at support right around $33.35 This is a zone which held strong at several points this year.

Selling volume hit a relative high yesterday and if today’s volume comes in way light that will confirm an oversold condition and very likely start a counter-trend. (Moving back up.)

According to [Y-charts](https://ycharts.com/companies/NRG/stock_buyback) they started buying back shares again in the quarter ended in March. ($8 million worth.) If they hit the same numbers as 2020 they should buyback about $250 million before the end of the year.

The stock is trading in a sweet spot $4 below it’s 200-day moving average. As you can see from this 1-year weekly chart below. Even in March of 2020, the pandemic crash, it only stayed below the 200 for 8-weeks. In all other cases it was a 5-week or less time period. The current time below 200 is 4-weeks. (The green line is the 200 day moving average.)

2021-05-14 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why Boomers and Millennials like $UWMC Boomers and Millennials agree on little nowadays. One is lazy, doesn't listen, already knows everything, and only thinks about themselves. The other are millennials. But $UWMC is a stock both can buy and hold for short term or long term. Here's why:

**The millennials case for $UWMC:**

Stock Deeply Undervalued: millennials love stocks that hedgies have (allegedly) artificially pushed down the price. UWM is a growing company and Wall Street has positioned itself as if UWM is shrinking.

Share Buybacks: millennials will recognize this buyback is different then say Apple. With $300 million in buybacks, UWM can reduce the whole float by almost 40%.

Option Open Interest: There are 131,934 open interest in options (as of this morning) with strikes at $10 and under. That is a lot of shares that the sellers of those options would need to find. The float could be reduced significantly by share buybacks at that time. Institutional investors easily control 20+million shares and they aren't selling at these prices. Gores holds 15.8m shares they bought for $10 a few months ago.

CEO: Mat is pissed Wall Street doesn't love his company as much as he does. He will do what it takes to get the price to what he needs it to be with the buybacks. He is game to play.

**The boomer case for $UWMC:**

Mortgages: Boomers love mortgages, the bigger the better. UWM is the largest wholesale mortgage provider in America. The mortgage industry isn't going anywhere and boomer's small brains can at least understand that.

Healthy Financials: UWM runs a tight ship and is very profitable. It also trades at a low P/E around 6 or so. Boomers love low P/E's cause they hate tech and tech is ""expensive"". They buy low P/E companies like T cause they are much smarter than millennials at investing.

Dividends: Boomers love dividends. They think it is free money. At a $7.5 stock price $UWMC pays a 5.3% dividend. But even better, UWM pays a dividend on its class A shares only. Class A is only 7% of the outstanding shares, so it costs UWM $42 million to pay a 5.3% dividend. For context, their net income Q1 was $800m+.

Share Buybacks: Boomers love getting their capital returned in a slow, and boring way. UWMC has a $300 million share buyback underway right now.

Mat Ishbia: Mat is a CEO boomers love. He played team sports and won an NCAA national championship riding the bench at Michigan State. Boomers love reading stories like that because they always preached hard work to their own kids from the couch.

So either a short term or long term investment, boomer or millenial, $UWMC looks interesting."
2021-05-14 00:35:53,wallstreetbets,I think this is the stock to own.  Rafi thinks this is headed to $20 soon if stars align.  Q1 was actually a beat not a miss.  Merger happened 1/3 of the way through the quarter but nobody is talking about that whatever.  Stock buybacks signal company is willing to defend it's sp so it is done going down now.  Cheers.  Lets get wsb behind it now and blow this small float out of the water.

The love for thy neighbors. Leave no man behind. I see humanity could finally be breaking that chain. I pray for you all. This is our chance. Our once in a lifetime chance to have riches. Don’t forget your loved ones who got you to this point. Share your wealth and do good with it unlike those rich assholes at the top who laugh at us. 🦧 unite! Let’s fucking 🚀to the 🌝!"

2021-05-13 20:51:04,wallstreetbets,"You should have averaged down like I did. Now I'm in the green with amc, it's a good strategy to use."
2021-05-14 00:39:20,wallstreetbets,Good Luck Fisdal!!!

2021-05-14 03:47:55,wallstreetbets,Jesus... I was complaining about buying at $12.96 lol well I'm finally evening out and still holding. We shall see where this goes....
2021-05-14 07:42:44,wallstreetbets,It's always better to average it down when it drops.
2021-05-14 10:49:44,wallstreetbets,I just got covered at $10.66. Finally in the green after months of holding. We’re coming for you fellow ape!

2021-05-14 02:05:03,wallstreetbets,"Avg is $7 and I'm in for a grand. Hoping this buys me a sick new car, but I could probably get a decent Honda if I cashed out now. 
Sucks for them that I already have one of those. Holding for $100 or better."
2021-05-14 01:03:14,wallstreetbets,With that many shared You should be the 1st to plant the Flag!

2021-05-13 22:28:38,wallstreetbets,It did a dip last week partially in response to it. The dilution is now priced in with the conclusion of the sale. And AMC is in a better financial position than it was before.
2021-05-14 08:49:30,wallstreetbets,💎🙌 are the only way my man
2021-05-13 21:23:17,wallstreetbets,Its different. There wasn't any new shares issued.
2021-05-13 21:29:32,wallstreetbets,Different my dude. He already had those shares available to do that.

2021-05-13 22:14:35,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at 4, and back in at 9. I was projecting a summertime number around 14-15. I did not expect today's numbers. 
I'm missing a chromosome if that helps 💎💎🖐🖖"

2021-05-13 21:04:20,wallstreetbets,100k is the floor
2021-05-13 20:56:22,wallstreetbets,Put more in and hold for GameStop prices
2021-05-14 04:20:01,wallstreetbets,"It's already trading at 3 times market cap of 2016... with no signs of changing the business or transforming it.

It is a LOOOOONG hold. People will get bored."
2021-05-14 10:31:30,wallstreetbets,My goal is $20 mid summer
2021-05-13 21:35:37,wallstreetbets,13avg gang. Time to eat
2021-05-13 22:32:08,wallstreetbets,I have 25 stocks. It will make good.
2021-05-13 22:40:14,wallstreetbets,"  Yuns will be Green once again tomorrow.  If you held at $5, should be easy to hold at $50k.  Keep hanging in, and you will be a multimillionaire soon!"
2021-05-14 00:42:17,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-13 21:27:55,wallstreetbets,In the $16 club as well.
2021-05-13 21:27:45,wallstreetbets,Holy shit my friend
2021-05-13 21:51:16,wallstreetbets,"You can bring your average down by buying more now you, ape!"
2021-05-13 22:23:33,wallstreetbets,I bought my first 2k at $13.62. Followed that by buying another 2k at $17.25. Soooo yeah!
2021-05-13 22:44:29,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
2021-05-14 00:13:53,wallstreetbets,40 shares at 18 lol! It hit 20 and the plummeted😅
2021-05-14 01:32:58,wallstreetbets,"16.40$ here, when I got spammed for suggesting that I would buy at 12$, because apparently it was ""never going to drop below 15""."
2021-05-13 22:24:30,wallstreetbets,"Dilution; an at-the-market option allows AMC to create and sell it's own shares for cash in order to reinvest, pay off debts, and pay other current liabilities. By doing this, the amount of shares being sold causes the price of their share to decrease as they are offering more shares to buyers at market or lower cost. Because lower bid shares are being bought instead of higher bid limit orders, the price stays the same or drops.

The price can also drop as share dilution scares off investors who would rather have their money sit in stable or growth stocks, and it's a sign of weak free cash flow (which is to say, the business cannot cover current expenses easily or generate more of its own cash through investment)."
2021-05-14 00:24:56,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-05-13 20:14:41,wallstreetbets,Same lmao...
2021-05-14 00:05:31,wallstreetbets,"Me too bro ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry). You might have bought in pre-market like me, as that was the only time it went to 25. Only you and me might be aware of it as even the historical chart doesn’t show that price ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)"
2021-05-13 22:15:56,wallstreetbets,"No shame, congratulations on the house!"
2021-05-13 20:43:55,wallstreetbets,Don’t put a date on it.
2021-05-14 01:04:49,wallstreetbets,They did this a few months ago and it crashed the stock actually.  That's why everyone is bagholding $14 and $16 a share.
2021-05-14 02:16:51,wallstreetbets,"You still don't get it do you? 
You guys gonna be bag holding soon when the sell offs start.."
2021-05-13 22:32:51,wallstreetbets,"I need a double dose of Keanu Reeves, STAT!"
2021-05-14 00:48:33,wallstreetbets,You need to squeeze your shit on outta here
2021-05-14 10:20:08,wallstreetbets,"we all sell at the top you fucking worm, APES STRONG TOGETHER"
2021-05-13 23:53:45,wallstreetbets,"Didn't they say they'd sign a contract that if given permission to issue a share dilution not a single share would be issued until 2022? This is shady AF, absolute contempt for their shareholders."
2021-05-14 05:21:32,wallstreetbets,No. Make me
2021-05-13 21:34:25,wallstreetbets,"So these were from a previously approved round and the ones voters just approved are ""locked up"" until 2022?"
2021-05-13 21:06:47,wallstreetbets,Thanks on it
2021-05-13 22:02:13,wallstreetbets,"For some like me that grabbed only 30-50 shares at $13-$15 was betting on a new GME. It was exploding the night it went up. So a lot jumped on. I always knew on its own merit, and amount of holders. It would hit 15-20 on its own merit, after a long wait till summer/fall. But I don’t believe personally it’s gonna hit $100 plus. I’d rather get my money back than wait for maybe $20 to make $80 or so. Just a bad move back then for many. I could do a lot more with the $400-$500 elsewhere. If I bought at $2-$8 with minimum 100 shares, I would hold right now."
2021-05-14 00:31:36,wallstreetbets,Eating crayons makes my balls big
2021-05-13 21:43:43,wallstreetbets,I have 102. Bought in Jan. Been crazy watching it go up.. might just buy more at the dip.. definitely wish I would have just taken the risk and bought 1000 shares.
2021-05-13 20:49:46,wallstreetbets,This is such good advice it should probably be banned from this sub lol
2021-05-14 01:45:46,wallstreetbets,That’s...not retarded
2021-05-14 02:38:56,wallstreetbets,This should be higher
2021-05-14 09:32:52,wallstreetbets,I want to see at least $420.69
2021-05-14 08:51:01,wallstreetbets,Are you sure you’re in the right place? This is actual sound advice.
2021-05-14 13:24:11,wallstreetbets,"> stocks gets you

lel"
2021-05-13 21:11:01,wallstreetbets,How do you solve the tax on such huge returns?
2021-05-14 13:47:15,wallstreetbets,"That only puts off the hard squeeze. It’s good advice for normal trading, but terrible for forcing a squeeze.
But what do I know, I’m not a financial advisor.
🙈🙊🙉💎💎💎"
2021-05-14 00:37:13,wallstreetbets,$15 to $20? You should get a job at Wendy’s Mr Artichoke Junior
2021-05-14 01:50:42,wallstreetbets,"I'm relatively new at this, and playing with less than $1,000, but I'm trying to balance optimism with realism. If it hits $100, gonna sell off  about 1/3 of my shares. Gonna hold the rest and see what happens. Averaging at $7.00/share, so it's all free money at this point."
2021-05-13 22:29:03,wallstreetbets,Keep buying. Lower your average. I worked mine down to 8.50.
2021-05-13 21:45:18,wallstreetbets,No worries fellow Ape. Patience.

2021-05-14 02:13:31,wallstreetbets,"If I'm not reading it wrong, there are gonna be a lot of bag holders on this one."
2021-05-14 03:52:25,wallstreetbets,How do we know they didn’t sell the shares to cover the shorts outside of the normal market? Hence no price movement?
2021-05-14 00:25:27,wallstreetbets,How many ?
2021-05-14 00:41:11,wallstreetbets,We’re coming for you soon
2021-05-14 04:15:33,wallstreetbets,"That's actually wrong, I believe last time was around 2015/2016. And it went up because of how they sell them. He said it in an interview."
2021-05-14 02:49:22,wallstreetbets,This was super obvious sarcasm come on man
2021-05-13 22:32:27,wallstreetbets,Don't get my hopes up.
2021-05-14 00:50:37,wallstreetbets,Didn’t hear market watch talk about AMC all day and we’re up over 23% for the day....what gives....🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-14 00:49:46,wallstreetbets,Lmao someone’s triggered because AMC is not doing what WSB says it should do aye

2021-05-14 04:48:41,wallstreetbets,"Because you guys are ruining the forum with spam.

You're a real special kind of idiot"
2021-05-13 21:57:48,wallstreetbets,This is 100% inaccurate.
2021-05-13 21:47:41,wallstreetbets,That vote was cancelled.
2021-05-13 21:47:39,wallstreetbets,"There are 0 shares available for AMC to add. They approved today’s 43M years ago, like 2013? Or something around that time frame. There are no additional shares in the future approved either right now. 

Stock is going to bust a giant load on HF’s"
2021-05-13 22:07:50,wallstreetbets,"I mean you do you. But seeing how much of the float is shorted, against how much of the float may be owners by retail investors, against the amount of short positions Citadel has against AMC alone. I’m willing to say that if people don’t paper hand it may get into the thousands a share."
2021-05-13 23:43:39,wallstreetbets,"I went all in on AMC in Feb.. Tis was a great day, and excited what tomorrow and beyond brings."

2021-05-13 23:57:39,wallstreetbets,That’s like asking why would I accept a promotion if it pays more and therefore I have to pay more taxes... why do people keep asking these questions on the tax?
2021-05-13 20:32:06,wallstreetbets,With is being almost $13 per share would it be smart to purchase? How high is is this projected to go?
2021-05-13 21:12:09,wallstreetbets,What price should we sell

2021-05-14 07:20:20,wallstreetbets,100% correct. Level headed analysis doesn’t apply to this stock at the moment. Old schoolers would probably be more comfortable owning and discussing their shares in Xerox or Ovaltine.

That money is funded by taxes as well as bonds sold to banks. That's a net zero in terms of money supply. Then some of those bonds are ""bought"" by the Fed, but all they do is give the banks an IOU and a note saying ""you can loan out N times as much money as the IOU is worth"". Still no new actual cash out there. Only when the *banks* lend out that money is money 'created'. And that loaned cash has to be paid back eventually; it isn't out there forever.

There are dangers to what the Fed is doing, but becoming Zimbabwe isn't one of them."

2021-05-14 05:39:46,wallstreetbets,"It's based in the concept of discounting cash flows. A company is only worth the value of all of its future profits discounted back to today. 

Why ""discount""? Because $1 earned today is worth more than $1 earned a year from now. 

 How do we compare money earned today versus money earned years in the future? Interest rates.

At a given interest rate, what amount would you need today to have $1 in the future? This is the 'present value' of that future $. Now you can compare alternatives of receiving money today versus receiving money in the future effectively by using present values of each scenario. 

Assuming 10% interest rates: 

1) $1 earned today is worth $1

2) The present value of a dollar earned 1 year from now is  $0.909

3) the present value of a dollar earned 2 years from now is $0.826

What does this mean? It means if someone offered to pay you $1 a year from now or $0.95 today, you take the $0.95.  $0.95 > $0.909. Said differently, if you took $0.95 today and invested it @ 10%, you have more than $1 in a year. 


Now assuming 15% interest rates: 
1) $1 earned today is worth $1

2) The present value of a dollar earned a year from now is  $0.870

3) the present value of a dollar earned 2 years from now is $0.756

Notice as the interest rates rise, the present value falls. It takes less money today to grow because interest is higher. 

 If a company is just the present value of all of its future profits, then the present value of a company is expected to fall as interest rates rise. 

Why does this effect tech companies more? More of their value is expected to be in future years due to their high growth rates (and often limited profitability today). Notice the delta in present values in the 1-year scenarios and the 2-year scenarios above. The PV in 2-year scenario drops ~2x as much. The further the profits are expected from today, the more sensitive they are to interest rate changes."
2021-05-14 09:48:53,wallstreetbets,"Dude imho real inflation hasn't been around during a time that tech was as important and powerful in our society as it is currently. Everyone that says you should drop tech BeCaUsE InFlAtIoN is in my opinion reading an extremely old edition of a textbook whose footnotes were disproven. 

Case in point- if businesses should be worried about inflation, how will they hedge? I can name quite a few tech institutions that are hedging with some digital assets. Are industrials planning on doing the same, or will they stick with the accruing debt playbook?"

2021-05-14 06:58:46,wallstreetbets,Biggie bag from Wendy's I'd call it a win

2021-05-14 09:34:44,wallstreetbets,I made almost 15k in the last few months almost solely on Tesla options. Now I’ve had three in a row fuck me like this. ALL that money gone 🤷🏽‍♂️😂
2021-05-13 20:32:42,wallstreetbets,"If I learned anything from trading, it's NEVER BUY TSLA OPTIONS"
2021-05-13 20:48:19,wallstreetbets,Some advice. Try to be less retarded.
2021-05-13 23:08:28,wallstreetbets,How much of your total money available does this loss represent?
2021-05-14 08:06:50,wallstreetbets,I’ve never been in a Tesla Uber. LOL
2021-05-14 10:18:25,wallstreetbets,Keep trying! Maybe that -5k will turn into a -50k like it did for me!

2021-05-14 09:52:59,wallstreetbets,"Exact date? Lol no, but weekly calls are more expensive than buying a call further out, per day anyways. Tesla calls Imo aren’t the best thing anymore, I don’t see it rising thousands of percent any time soon."
2021-05-13 23:28:20,wallstreetbets,As of right now. Never ever
2021-05-14 03:01:17,wallstreetbets,Or gme.

Q1 revenues: $121M (approx. 5% beat)

Q2 revenue guidance raised from $117M to $155M 

Full year 2021 guidance raised from $500M to $600M"
2021-05-14 10:49:19,wallstreetbets,Well at least it is headed the right direction for now... let’s see if it all gets given back again.
2021-05-14 09:34:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah - very strange activity. It beat earnings and went up $25 (25%) in AH trading that same day and then the very next day literally gave it all back. Not sure why that would be unless it was as simple as institutional investors buying it up and the old institutional investors getting out. Wacky.
2021-05-14 08:50:03,wallstreetbets,"Message from the future, I was on the money. Sales figures remained on par with last month."

2021-05-13 21:41:29,wallstreetbets,Palantir is one of the most successful companies in the stock market today set up for infinite growth. Just have to keep buying and give it time. I'm suprise the price target isn't higher honestly.
2021-05-13 20:16:56,wallstreetbets,TO THE MOON
2021-05-13 21:17:29,wallstreetbets,They reporting price targets in pesos?
2021-05-13 21:28:03,wallstreetbets,A $170 price target in 2027 sounds reasonable
2021-05-14 00:36:03,wallstreetbets,Pltr has been a disappointment for me :(
2021-05-13 20:07:57,wallstreetbets,I looked quick I thought it said $17 and I just ‘bout shit muh britches 💩
2021-05-13 20:10:37,wallstreetbets,Maybe a typo? Did they mean $17. But yeah... crack is a hell of a drug!
2021-05-13 20:15:24,wallstreetbets,I guess we now know Citigroup is short Palantir.
2021-05-13 20:28:09,wallstreetbets,"Hahah citi can lick my hairy ball sack

2021-05-13 20:56:20,wallstreetbets,They took too much Sharons I reckon...
2021-05-13 21:10:17,wallstreetbets,they intentionally did it to grab attention.

2021-05-14 00:51:17,wallstreetbets,I think they put the decimal in the wrong place. (should be one place to the left)
2021-05-14 01:02:24,wallstreetbets,People must have misread it and thought they said $17.00
2021-05-14 01:20:46,wallstreetbets,Citi needs fresh bag holders.
2021-05-14 01:20:58,wallstreetbets,Holy SHIT wtf?!  this seems extraordinarily high.

2021-05-14 01:53:30,wallstreetbets,I say buy between 15-16.
2021-05-14 03:00:20,wallstreetbets,they probably meant $17 since they have a habit of adding extra zeros...Remember this is the same company that wrote a check to Revlon for $900 million instead of $9 million.
2021-05-14 03:50:26,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow it's that easy huh. Okay, I officially give GME a sell rating at $3."
2021-05-14 04:07:16,wallstreetbets,I think somebody stuck an extra 0 in there and meant $17
2021-05-14 13:08:50,wallstreetbets,Probably a typo they ment 17 lmao
2021-05-13 22:39:12,wallstreetbets,Typo. Should be $17 or $70.
2021-05-13 22:19:29,wallstreetbets,So you are saying they mistyped $17
2021-05-14 00:08:12,wallstreetbets,Lmao
2021-05-14 04:09:51,wallstreetbets,"It's $17, not $170"

2021-05-14 13:19:14,wallstreetbets,I’m a man of my word
2021-05-14 00:16:36,wallstreetbets,The day they were all spamming that wsb was buying silver as a distraction from GME was some twilight zone shit.  It was literally every news outlet and no one on here was buying or talking about silver...  That's the day I learned how manipulated it really is.
2021-05-13 23:40:19,wallstreetbets,This comment should have 1000 more points. Eventually mainstream media will lie themselves out of a job
2021-05-13 23:22:42,wallstreetbets,Zachs does if I'm not mistaken
2021-05-13 22:36:49,wallstreetbets,Some would say it's a speedball picking up speed...

2021-05-14 15:36:13,wallstreetbets,"I've just run the numbers and my new announced price target for GE is $270.

2021-05-14 10:54:33,wallstreetbets,"Right now, at under $20/share, this is one of the better plays out there for the long term (5-10 year horizon). PLTR is deeply involved in joint DoD applications as we (USA) shift to asymmetric warfare. So many applications there thay extend way beyond Gotham."

2021-05-14 01:37:58,wallstreetbets,"1. Excuse me sir, but why were rational voices in this sub in the first place?
2. Well yeah, no shit. I hope the squeeze happens, but GME is profitable for me at $101 too, so I can afford to hold. $180 is still a really high price as far as I'm concerned."
2021-05-13 21:11:02,wallstreetbets,I was looking at this earlier today.  What app specifically?  There are 3 Fidelity apps in the iOS appstore.
2021-05-14 07:12:52,wallstreetbets,"For me, I’m yet to see solid thesis on why a short squeeze is unlikely or a way that shorts wouldn’t have to cover. 

The risk I feel is that you are reliant on millions of other retail investors not paperhanding. But they’ve been pretty resilient for months now. 

Would I YOLO life savings on GME/AMC?  No. 

But I think it’s worth gambling an amount I can afford to lose and seeing it out to the end. 

Just my personal view on it."
2021-05-14 08:34:59,wallstreetbets,OH NO!! <shocked pikachu face>
2021-05-14 14:20:21,wallstreetbets,I mean yall could actually place these bets and just sell some calls...
2021-05-14 07:35:27,wallstreetbets,"If $180 is a high price for you, then you should sell.

No squeeze is happening. All the shorts are sitting at the top now. It's not like when the stock was worth a few dollars."

If your home was built before 1978, it is more likely to have lead-based paint. In 1978, the federal government banned consumer uses of lead-based paint, but some states banned it even earlier. Some can have no symptoms, but people may experience:

Pain areas: in the abdomen or joints
Gastrointestinal: constipation, nausea, or vomiting
Developmental: learning disability or slow growth
Whole body: fatigue or loss of appetite
Behavioral: hyperactivity or irritability
Also common: baby colic, headache, insomnia, or memory loss

Lead is added to paint to accelerate drying, increase durability, maintain a fresh appearance, and resist moisture that causes corrosion."

2021-05-13 20:12:47,wallstreetbets,"There have been many instances where making money isn’t the priority for these hololive streamers. One right off the bat is when [Gura got age restricted playing resident evil 2](https://youtu.be/eZgFpqswapE) (which disables super chat) and she didn’t even bother to stop the stream to reset.

Another time is when Ame purposely turns off super chat because she’s receiving too many.

They’re really there to entertain their audience, not specifically only to make money."
2021-05-13 22:06:25,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it just depends on if it’s your thing or not. I won’t fault them for not liking Hololive, but I’ll vehemently disagree with criticism that ignores their talent.

I find twitch streamers really boring, tried watching a Ludwig stream (drawing and guessing game) and it was just really stale jokes and bad art. I think the only reason it was interesting was for the cash prize. VTubers seem to put in a lot more work but for me it still seems like cut anime girl says bad word is what’s popular. Reminds me of people laughing because a kid said a bad word or said something grown up. I do enjoy stories but the ones he mentioned seem very meh. I get their popularity and would probably would have liked them if I was in middle school. If you have an anime recommendation throw it my way lol. Haven’t watched anime in a while."

2021-05-14 01:42:23,wallstreetbets,"How banks build up extra reserves is a manifold answer, it's usually through:

1. Overnight lending by the Fed to some institutions that have to meet cash obligations to some other institutions but don't want to have to decrease lending to get those reserves to pay. So: bank A borrows money from bank B (to lend out), bank B chickens out and wants their cash back in case shit goes sideways because of event X (could be crisis, could be cash crunch etc). Bank A has already made the loans, so they don't have cash on hand unless they recall the loans already made. They turn to the Fed for an overnight loan collateralised by the Treasuries they hold. Fed makes the loan with reserves credited into bank A and bank A pays bank B with reserves. Bank B now has extra reserves that they do not need to back up their deposits -> Excess reserves.
2. QE: Fed wants to directly expand broad money (reserves + coins + notes are just base money, no one can spend/lend reserves in the non-banking world), they go out to the market to buy bonds from funds. But they have to give someone the reserves (cash is shit for billions of dollars), so they go to the fund's bank A, credit them with reserves, bank A opens a deposit for the fund matching the amount. But this amount of reserves is greater than what's needed to back up their deposits -> excess reserves.

Yes it should nudge the t-bill rates up in the short end since, as far as I understand (I don't work in a bank), repo and short T-bills are pretty substitutable. If you're a money market funds, there are some regulations about what you have to hold so there might be some preferences here and there."

It tends to just waffle up and down in small increments but has steadily moved downward when CPI numbers come out.

And this isn't a day trade and i got no TA for ya this is just looking at the general economy and going yep i think stuff is going to keep going up in price while wages will stay the same hence more inflation i'm also think that the fed will eventually raise interest rates before the end of this year.

2021-05-14 01:13:21,wallstreetbets,"The problem isn't so much excess liquidity, it's supply constraints, as well as changes in consumer needs (ie, buying different things being at home all the time) that are raising some prices and these constraints will resolve into 2021/2022 assuming normal life resumes.  Prices will drop.

I honestly think that the inflation fear-mongering has more to do with the financial systems and interested parties not wanting to see wages rise.  2020 had probably one of the most unusual turnover in jobs since, well, never.  In addition, work from home, which was strongly resisted by many companies in the past, was shown to be a very viable solution for many companies.  This allows a greater job market for employees, as you no longer have to live where you work, so much more opportunities available.   Also, people sitting home for a year had time to find new hobbies, learn new skills, and discover perhaps that the field or job they used to have just wasn't as good as they thought.  Many people also realized the savings that staying home caused and probably re-tooled their budgets.  Also, many women left the workforce during all this and some dual earner households may decide to change that.  So in general, all these things are going to make employees a lot more picky when it comes to employment, thus demanding a higher wage.

 If wages increase on the low side, that extra $ is less for the high side.  If they try to pass along the cost to consumers then the gov will have no choice to increase tax or interest to prevent inflation which will also have a greater effect for the high side.  So both ways they lose.  They are trying to scare companies to downsize staff in anticipation of this artificial ""inflation"" in order to keep the underlings in their place.

TLDR; Headhunters and employment firms are gonna bank in this post covid economy."
2021-05-14 01:26:14,wallstreetbets,"The fun thing about student debt and inflation is that if inflation is 4-6% it actually means your debt is shrinking (relatively) by that much each year.  I dunno what current loan rates are but people who took loans when I did are only paying 3-5% for interest.  So you are basically getting a negative interest.  And if you have cash left over that you didn't spend from the loan, you can throw it in a treasury bond and get the inflation rate as the interest.  And you still get the tax writeoff at the end of the year.   It's  free money."
2021-05-14 01:25:17,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps. I tend to stay off the conspiracy aspect, but that can always be explained as self-interest (i.e. wanting wages to stay low) forming opinions (that inflation is going up) without it being a deliberative process (i.e. it is not a conspiracy)."
2021-05-14 03:30:41,wallstreetbets,"oh no, I didn't mean to imply conspiracy.  Lots of self interested parties just spouting their own self-interested narratives, to which elevated wages represent a danger to their interests.  But you also have to understand how things get into the news cycle - well thought-out and delivered press releases that assert the narrative that is in their benefit.  If you think for a second that banks and companies -don't- have meetings about this type of stuff, you've had more honest jobs than me."

The perceptions is that Musk did a rug pull on DOG and BIT. I don't believe it myself, but judging by memes in other areas that's the narrative they are pushing. People invested  in Musk the man as much as his ideas. If they lose faith in the man then the stock will suffer because of it."

I messed with options one time with $400 and went from a $1000 gain to worthless overnight. At the time, I thought it was best to hold it until it was closer to the expiration date. I wish more people would post about taking a profit ASAP when it comes to options. It really is something you have to try before you truly understand it."
2021-05-14 00:09:24,wallstreetbets,"For starters, you don’t “do” options. That’s like saying you “do” weed. You buy/sell options."

2021-05-14 05:15:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah those are fairly short-term puts IMO. You're taking huge risk with that, unless you can see a big event coming up I wouldn't buy puts with such a close expiration date.

Puts are already giving you quite a bit of leverage, so I prefer to space them out over a longer timeframe. Even if I think the crash is coming next month, I prefer to buy year-long puts."

2021-05-14 01:27:19,wallstreetbets,"The Xilinx merger, interests rate re-valuation, TSM production constraints (drought, over demands for chips), and intel engineering focus ceo are main reasons for amd at $73.

The vertical, mostly non-competitive merger between Xilinx and amd depends on China. It’s a Major risk, even if approval seem likely. A clear example would be with NXPI merger with quadcom, which was not approved. The end of the year is a conservative estimate, and the merger may close sooner under the perfect conditions. Xilinx ceo has commented on the merger as proceeding along. UK regulators are ending open comments against the merger May 21 based on articles found. President Joe Biden wants the job act pass first before moving on. China is likely not in the cross hair yet. We got 6 to 7 months more. amd is better with the merger as a company. Amd stock may have been better off without the merger near terms. Less parties shorting amd and going long Xilinx.

Interests rates are believed to be capped at 2% or less based on comments about bond market and US feds. Covid is not ending else where without vaccination (beside likely the USA and for sure Israel). Negative interest rates (demands for US bonds) are still there globally. Women unemployment is high in the US. Childcare is decimated. 

Intel the other factor.
Intel is expected to be pulling off Alder Lake for the massive with reportedly 20% IPC boost, windows scheduler optimized for heterogeneous workload vs current homogeneous workloads, and wide availability for ddrm 5 (expecting 10% available in 2021 according to dr Ian from Anandtech). Alder lake max configuration is 8 golden coves (high performance core with 16 threads) and 8 gracemont/ atoms (low energy consumption with 8 threads). It looks to be losing out to AMD in total performance. Not sure about lower consumption? 

If alder is less than expectations, amd should head higher. 

As apple moves toward 5 nm, more 7 nm allocation is available to every one else. TSM is also expanding. Supply constraint is at its maximum now, and less so going forward?

Amd pricing should be higher with merger conclusion approaching. Sell OTM calls to stay long the stocks / long terms calls ? 

I am bottom fishing with options and long the stocks into the merger."

2021-05-14 13:31:21,wallstreetbets,"These inflation numbers seems to have a lot more to do with supply chain constraints. Typical macro supply and demand. Labor is be part of this too with unemployment benefits. Once supply chain normalizes both on the logistical and manufacturing product front as well as on the labor front, so does inflation."

I bet its also the real reason behibd the unrests, wages are too low for the average person to have a reasonable life.

It solved a similar problem efficiently."

2021-05-14 14:16:05,wallstreetbets,"Point is, supply chain management has a lot to do with a lot, especially when most of industry is set up for just in time manufacturing and having to switch to stockpiling, creating a huge surge in current demand since it’s forecasting (or mitigating potential risk of) future manufacturing and logistical constraints."
2021-05-14 02:00:13,wallstreetbets,"Lets hope it doesnt go that far when the stupid ruling class can avoid this by raising wages, interest rates and tax."
2021-05-14 09:44:38,wallstreetbets,"your point about splitting index up is worth an additional reply. I know exactly how this works since any stock index works in identical way. 

Eg, sometimes a stock will show a blowout move due to earnings or take over. This will show that day it was reaponsible for x% of the move of index. Looking at the data you'd be tempted to dismiss it, call it transitory or one off, but its a silly way to look at things, because you have no idea what fair value is or what is priced in right now. Ie. the stock should have been at xxx if we had perfect data but we had to wait til earnings to find out this data, thus it shows a jump to fair value. 

Same thing for prices of any item in the cpi, non can be dismissed, used cars could have been specially beaten down over last months due to xyz and this month it bounces. Just like whichever item showed a big drop this month is likely to reverse with a big jump or steady rise later. 

It is absolutely non sense to dismiss any part of cpi data because you have no idea what is the fair value of any of the items. The used car data series only makes sense to a used car sales man, since nobody is an expert in everything we can only look at the level of the index. to say a rise is transitory, you are basically speculating prices will fall on average without reduction in money supply, they might, but a typical economist will have zero basis for this speculation and we should attach zero importance to these types of forecasts...

As to split mon inflation with the rest. forget it, it is completely impractical. You can never disentangle money from demand supply, its like disassociating the length of your sofa from the ruler you are measuring with..."
2021-05-14 10:09:48,wallstreetbets,"Inflation (in this case, CPI) is high because a year ago we had massive deflation. [Source](https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/economicdata/cpi_05122020.pdf)

This higher inflation (CPI) is a correction from that previous data point. It's like in March when the stock market was up to something like 120% year on year.

But everything that's up high has a reason. For example, used cars are so high because the chip shortage is creating a shortage of new cars. (New cars aren't up because manufacturers set those prices, while used cars are a more open market). When the chip shortage is resolved the price of used cars will drop.

Oil has a similar issue, oil companies cut production and it'll take time to ramp back up.

But CPI isn't the only aspect of inflation. For example, it doesn't account for wages. It doesn't account for material costs. Etc. The idea the CPI is the end all be all to inflation is incorrect. It's only one indicator, and the trend of future inflation might or might not correlate to this.

April 2022 the CPI will likely be very low (or maybe even negative again) because the inflated costs will decrease as the market works out things like the oil supply and shortages. What I mean by ""true"" inflation, is the long-term real value reduction of the dollar after this oscillation caused by the pandemic ends. We won't know the hard impact of inflation for years."
2021-05-14 10:58:26,wallstreetbets,"your idea could happen but you need to understand you are speculating on a whole series of events - chip shortagr going away, input costs all coming down and wages not going up and nothing else disruptive happening... What you are doing is basic mean reversion trade, any mean reversion trader will tell you your odds are just slightly in favor but the one incorrect bet will blow out your account.

The fed is not competant enough to make bets like this and should never claim inflation is transitory as they clearly have no ability to forecast it."
2021-05-14 11:16:52,wallstreetbets,"You seem to misunderstand my position. I'm not saying that inflation isn't high. I've been saying the entire time that most likely inflation isn't high. Anything in the market is speculation. But are the odds in favor of a lower (2-3% inflation) or a higher (4%-5%) inflation, in the long term. It's more likely to be lower because the April 2020 - April 2021 inflation rate is unreliable."

2021-05-14 06:48:43,wallstreetbets,"Inflation will not be necessary for metals to take off. Both have already experienced nice gains over the last 12 months and it wasn't due to money printing. Defaults and bankruptcies are on the horizon and CMBS is gonna be a thing. Plenty of debt is going to be extinguished and those dollars will disappear. This inflationary period is only going to last for so long. The dollar is not going to crash and talk of Euro or Yuan is not based in reality

The actual demand for a very limited supply will be the driver regardless of traditional economic indicators. Fear will drive gold (it's already happening) and silver will follow.

There's probably one more significant downdraft for metals but demand will be epic and premiums will be stunning."

2021-05-14 13:34:55,wallstreetbets,"I mean it's kind of a hobby too.

Also these are auctions, if they didn't want to get ripped off they'd set a starting bid or directly sell at a given price. Short of melting them, they're only valuable to people who think they're valuable. To everyone else, they're just some random old coins we found in grandpa's drawer.

And lots of these coins were like 90% silver. Individually they're small but it adds up fast, and sometimes you're buying for less than 50% of the melt value.

And again, the melt value is just their floor value. Some can be worth 2, 3, 4x as much. I couldn't tell you why some random years and mints are more valuable than others to save my life (besides basic supply and demand), but there are plenty of amateur and professional resources out there that list how much they're worth.

2021-05-14 11:46:02,wallstreetbets,Would love to hear that at the upcoming share holders meeting. Would make this a much longer term play for me
2021-05-14 11:52:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah same, May 25th. They need to start paying dividends or do some buyback. Hows your stick literally the same price it was at IPO? Its been what, 8 to 9 months now? They don't care abiut their investors at all. The stocks been trading 80% of the time in a range. Lets see what the meeting is all about else I'm bailing first chance. Not to mention, there is hardly any volume so no one is touching this stock."
2021-05-14 11:54:23,wallstreetbets,"I’d prefer they release 3% more into the float, so ETFs and S&P can pick it up. I know the sale would cause a further dip, but the upward pressure after that would be immense"

2021-05-14 10:25:55,wallstreetbets,"I truly believe something is going to happen this year in terms of ufos. I encourage everyone to take a look at this topic of ufos and potential extraterrestrial visitors.

There are cases like the Lonnie Zamora incident, USS Nimitz encounter or the Arial school sighting that are very interesting and can't be easily explained.

If you're new to this I highly recommend watching the documentary The Phenomenon by James Fox."

2021-05-13 20:56:30,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely not.

I may be biased, my wife does work for a subsidiary of Nucor so I do have a conflict of interests. But I do get to overhear a lot in how they’re discussing the quarters they’re having. Steel is BOOMING. We’ve tried to get as much stock as possible. People are building like crazy post-COVID. Production is crazy right now. There is SO much demand.

I think if they get the infrastructure plan off the ground federally, Nucor is going to get A LOT of that money. All those infrastructure talks are subject to Buy American laws. Also, SECDEF was on Nucor’s Board before Biden tapped him. I love Nucor’s outlook."

2021-05-13 20:51:29,wallstreetbets,"Uh.. that’s not how investing works.

I bought in at $45 in February not because I expected it to hit $300 again anytime soon, but because it was a great investment at that price. Since then, they’ve brought on many high level e-commerce executive talent, completed a $500M stock sale, paid off their long term debt, and opened a huge distribution center in PA. They are in such a fantastic position for growth.

So if it hits $40 again, I’m not dumping my 401k in because I think it’s going to immediately rebound, I’m dumping it in because it’s an incredible value and I couldn’t believe I’d be getting the same deal I got before all that happened.

You’re talking about GME being worth $2.9B market cap (after just raising $550M of capital). That’s so insane, I would absolutely love that opportunity."
2021-05-14 07:44:34,wallstreetbets,"10x an E. T.  H spot trade over the weekend rode it from 3600 to 4K GG 

Best part (though not good if it happens) unlike leverage trading in the stock market, if your price target doesn’t hit, you don’t owe the money you leveraged. You get liquidated yes that’s bad but it’s better than owing money. Just throw more money in the slot machine and see if u can 10x an E—T—H long and ride it to 5k."

2021-05-14 03:36:13,wallstreetbets,"Historically, every peak after good news has been shorted massively, as the company was in a permanent state of crisis. The analyst of Raymond James (who has not been able to understand the RNG potential, as since when the stock was below $3 he had a neutral rating...) missing the larger picture......  
  
But why now RNG trucks deserve attention? BEV trucks, especially for class 8 versions, are not yet there from a commercial point of view. The ones that will be available will likely require:  
  
\- either some time to be charged  
\- and / or some space from the cargo capacity of the truck.  
  
If you add to this that in some harbors like the LA ones, 16k trucks operate per day, it becomes clear that the area would not be able to stand all these vehicles to switch to electricity. The grid will not be there tomorrow and won't be there in 5 years.  
  
Most importantly, Regulation on the emission side is not waiting for BEV trucks. California will require already in 2024 all trucks to record -75% NOX...

The partnership with Microsoft and payment of the XBOX store or others. Every deal that foley has his hands on wasn’t in that Earnings report or at least just minimal. Go and see on Fintel the 13F fillings...wells Fargo just bought 7.7million shares! There are many others and the institutional ownership is only near 9%. Just wait and see what happens in this price range right now..."

Plus there were reduced sport events during the pandemic. Now things are opening up. I'm still long on this stock for sure but also betting on short term bounce as it getting so low in value."

They notified us yesterday (we are all still working from home) that our return to workplace would not be as originally planned - that we would be seeing a hybrid, next generation model put in place.
