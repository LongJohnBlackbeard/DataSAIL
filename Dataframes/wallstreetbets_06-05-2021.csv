2021-06-05 19:37:29,wallstreetbets,"This will explode!
So many positive catalysts:

1. Super high short interest.
2. Highly owned by institutions who can’t sell until 30$ for 90 days
3. Just added to MCIV index
4. Will be added to RUSSEL 3000
5. Available shares keeps decreasing
6. Borrowing rate going up
7. More exposure to apes!
8. They beat earnings during their last call
9. Any NEXT PR will fuel this to the moon!
10. THEY HAVE CASH AND NO DEBT, thus NO Dilutions like AMC
11. I missed out on GME at 10$, I’m
Not missing this rocketship!"
2021-06-05 19:57:18,wallstreetbets,I'm hoping we see a run up to $3000 PPS.
2021-06-05 19:48:24,wallstreetbets,I swear it's MMED
2021-06-05 19:59:50,wallstreetbets,"Also CHECK out CLOV!

Also joining the Russel 3000 soon

So many positive catalysts:

1. Extremely high SI (40%+)
2. High institutional investors who can’t sell until stock hits 30$ for 90 days. Stock is currently at 9$.
3. Recently joined MCSI index and had a nice run up from 7.7 to 9
4. ZERO DEBT, 700 million cash, unlike AMC, no risk of dilution!
5. Will be added to Russel 3000 soon, should be another nice reason to begin lift off
6. Available shares to short almost done and BORROWING rate going up, doubled last week.
7. They beat earnings two weeks ago! 
8. Backed by Chamath and Clintons
9. Don’t miss the next rocketship"

2021-06-05 19:50:27,wallstreetbets,They uplisted to the NASDAQ and thus the ticket change.
2021-06-05 19:50:43,wallstreetbets,Well I'm holding the Canadian version now haha i didn't look at exchange

2021-06-05 19:53:16,wallstreetbets,It is a place we don't discuss on WSB... This the ticker given was the NASDAQ ticker lol.
2021-06-05 19:54:16,wallstreetbets,yeah. Very much correlated.  Part of the plan was to get institutional money (thus the NASDAQ uplisting) and Russell 3000 can only hold US shares of US companies I think.
2021-06-05 19:58:10,wallstreetbets,I wonder why /s lol I'm gonna hold like good retard anyways see what happens lol

2021-06-05 19:05:59,wallstreetbets,"holy shit was this at Notre Dame?

I remember the prof then gave us an extra hour after the exam to make up for the disturbance. Apparently he does this every year, sometimes with multiple gorillas.

EDIT: [Here's an article from 2012](https://bizmagazine.nd.edu/issues/2012/fall-2012/meet-carl-ackermann/) that this has not only been an annual tradition for the finance department, but something that the University has officially published. Strange that they can't just update the time window, but I for one love the shenanigans and it's one of the things that made ND such a great business school. Carl's a legendary professor."
2021-06-05 19:41:48,wallstreetbets,"Hey everybody, some context:

I didn't realize that I didn't meet the comment karma requirement when I first posted this, so the title comes off as being incredibly arrogant and selfish. To clarify: **the professor paid us to do this.** My roommate (the banana) and I were former students of his, who also had this happen during the exam. The University only gives two hours to take a midterm exam, which the prof felt was too short and didn't let his students adequately take it. He came up with a manufactured disturbance years ago and has been doing it annually ever since.

By creating a small disturbance that doesn't even last a minute just a few minutes after the exam begins, he can excuse giving extra time, and the administration allows it. The students surveyed afterwards have a majority approval of that since time is a goddamn **premium** on these tests and that extra hour is a godsend."
2021-06-05 18:56:44,wallstreetbets,RIP to banana guy whose face was seen during this lmao
2021-06-05 19:08:35,wallstreetbets,It looks like it wasn’t funny 2019 either.  I hope you are better at buying and holding.

2021-06-05 18:52:13,wallstreetbets,Why would you disturb exam writing individuals like this ? Damn that's just bad. Be a better person kiddo. This is childish shit. If your fun is disturbing others you got to re-evaluate your life choices.
2021-06-05 19:22:04,wallstreetbets,"Who gave this a wholesome award lol

Edit: Sorry for acting like an idiot. I gave the OP two upvotes and award to compensate for this. I am deeply sorry for this and I shouldn’t have jumped to conclusions like I did earlier. Please accept my apology. Thanks u/Shawndy58 and u/ElCoochieController for trying to rectify the situation as well"

2021-06-05 19:33:12,wallstreetbets,"Yes!! This is almost exactly what happened. I didn't realize I wasn't meeting the karma requirement when I posted this (how come you can post but not comment until 50 karma?), but yeah it was 100% an inside job so the prof could grant students extra time. He does indeed do this every year, and my roommate (the banana) and I happened to be the ones he chose for 2018 and 2019."
2021-06-05 19:21:27,wallstreetbets,"And they wait for him, and his film crew with opened doors ? That's just a traditional stunt to give the kids an extra hour..."
2021-06-05 19:54:01,wallstreetbets,nahhh from the way you titled it kinda think you posted it as some 'cool ape prank' you did to get some props for on here. F
2021-06-05 19:53:22,wallstreetbets,Lol that was my roommate. He doesn't really give a fuck.
2021-06-05 19:17:30,wallstreetbets,lmao like half the guys are just focused on their exam
2021-06-05 19:37:58,wallstreetbets,"Eh, funny or not, the prof wanted it to happen. He does this every year and I just happened to do it 2018/2019. Only reason he didn't do it this past year was because of on-campus Covid protocols.

Let me make one thing clear: this wasn't to be funny, even though we did have fun with it. This was to grant students a 50% time extension in manufacturing a small, controlled disturbance early on as an excuse."
2021-06-05 19:27:49,wallstreetbets,"I chuckled, at this comment. Not at the video."
2021-06-05 19:57:08,wallstreetbets,Thanks mate. I really should have posted a more explanatory title so people didn't think this was just on my own accord.
2021-06-05 19:35:47,wallstreetbets,"Sorry for the delay in responding - karma requirements and all that

We were paid to do this by the prof. My roommate (the banana) and I were former students who had this happen to them when we went through the exam on our own. The University only grants two hours to take the test, so he manufactures an over-the-top disturbance that lets him have an excuse to say ""hey everyone I'm giving you an extra hour to take the exam to make up for the gorilla incident"" and the administration allows it.

The disturbance is short, only a few minutes into the exam, and allows people an entire 50% time extension."
2021-06-05 19:07:12,wallstreetbets,Imaging willingly showing people this.
2021-06-05 19:30:50,wallstreetbets,"The Prof paid us, former students who had this happen to them in a previous year, to do this. The logic is that the University only grants a two hour time window, so he wanted to have an excuse to grant an additional hour. By doing this one-minute disturbance only a few minutes into the exam, he could justify it to the administration. He's consistently one of the highest-rated professors, so he must be doing something right."
2021-06-05 19:19:54,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, what a bunch of assholes"
2021-06-05 19:46:41,wallstreetbets,"Funny you should say that! This was actually the first time my path crossed with my current SO who, at the time, wanted to kill me. It became a funny story after we started dating and she found out who that gorilla was 😂"
2021-06-05 19:29:21,wallstreetbets,"The Prof paid us to do it and all the TA's were in on it... If I didn't do it he would have hired some other former student to. It's to grant an extra hour of time, which after the exam he asks the students if they approved of it and every year the majority says yes it was worth it for the extra time"
2021-06-05 19:22:18,wallstreetbets,"And churlish.

OP needs to be sent to OShagHennesy's office."
2021-06-05 19:07:45,wallstreetbets,Think about it everyone is focused on those two. If it was planned someone inside was cheating
2021-06-05 19:52:27,wallstreetbets,If you read op comments you’ll understand why.
2021-06-05 19:52:05,wallstreetbets,"Funny thing is we were actually paid by the prof to do this and it's the first time I met my SO, so I'd say it ended up pretty nicely"

2021-06-05 19:45:23,wallstreetbets,"Because I couldn't provide any context due to karma requirements preventing me from commenting 😓

It's actually for a good cause! The prof paid us to do this (doesn't take no for an answer as we would do it for free) so he can grant one hour of extra time to a two-hour exam. To everybody, that's a **godsend** as time is at a premium. He always asks students afterwards and they overwhelmingly say it's worth the disturbance to have that extra time, so we must be doing something right."
2021-06-05 19:49:33,wallstreetbets,"Actually, it was carefully timed and practiced to be just over 30 seconds from start to finish! The Prof and the TA's planned this out so that an extra hour could be granted to the students, and everybody involved agreed that it's a good thing.

To answer your question: none! I'm betting on GME paying off my student loans lol"
2021-06-05 19:56:40,wallstreetbets,"Notre Dame, actually!"
2021-06-05 19:49:58,wallstreetbets,Except... I actually did do this? There's literal video evidence that this happened lol
2021-06-05 19:57:47,wallstreetbets,The prof paid us to crash it for 30 seconds near the beginning so he could grant a 1 hour time extension. Actually quite beneficial to the students.
2021-06-05 19:26:37,wallstreetbets,Yeah this seems pretty clearly like the prof wanted it to happen
2021-06-05 19:34:40,wallstreetbets,And the other half just realized they were doing theirs upside down a few minutes later
2021-06-05 19:46:32,wallstreetbets,Small controlled interruptions in time extensions you say
2021-06-05 19:40:05,wallstreetbets,So involuntary cheating?

2021-06-05 19:35:58,wallstreetbets,You prolly should've included this in the post. People in the comments are out to get you lmao
2021-06-05 19:39:23,wallstreetbets,"You should’ve put that in the title, otherwise you just look disruptive and discourteous. Why would anyone think otherwise without more information?"

2021-06-05 19:51:21,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it was planned, but by the prof and TA's"
2021-06-05 19:56:10,wallstreetbets,"Still kinda dumb of an excuse. If the prof is the one paying for this to happen, couldn’t he just make a shorter exam with the same difficulty?"
2021-06-05 19:50:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that didn't happen. Professor didn't have anything to do with it. You and your mates are all cunts. Everyone here knows it, just delete this post."
2021-06-05 19:52:51,wallstreetbets,Well I guess good on you. But professor should just offer more time without the schtick
2021-06-05 19:59:55,wallstreetbets,That shit is wholesome af
2021-06-05 19:36:39,wallstreetbets,Lol. Funny.
2021-06-05 19:43:12,wallstreetbets,"Mind explaining how it's cheating? We just do a quick disturbance that, sure, it's a distraction, but the TA's are instructed to watch very carefully for any students who try to take advantage of the situation. We had a meeting before the exam to go over what exactly will happen, what cadence the moves will be, etc."
2021-06-05 19:54:22,wallstreetbets,U ever taken a college exam to see how tough it is? That professor is godtier
2021-06-05 19:47:12,wallstreetbets,I didn't have the karma to comment but somehow had enough karma to post. I had no idea I would get this badly fucked over by that small window between the two lmao
2021-06-05 19:47:53,wallstreetbets,"When I posted this, I thought that since I had enough karma to post I had enough karma to comment. To say I was mistaken is an **understatement**."
2021-06-05 19:50:18,wallstreetbets,I didn't know that I didn't have the comment karma requirement when I posted :I
2021-06-05 19:51:00,wallstreetbets,For the first 40 or so minutes after it was posted I was frantically trying to comment to explain what the context is omg this went so horribly
2021-06-05 19:58:09,wallstreetbets,Not unless he has to go by a certain standard and the syllables has to go by the head department and college guidelines. My uncle who is a college teacher just answered this question.
2021-06-05 19:52:30,wallstreetbets,"The time limit is part of the exam.
By taking more time than allotted, it is cheating.
Consider the SATs.  If somehow you were able to start early or finish later, that would be cheating.
PENCILS DOWN!"
2021-06-05 19:55:30,wallstreetbets,"You know, you might have a point there if it weren't for the fact that other departments are given more time and finance was limited just because size, or the fact that the administration actually allows this to happen year after year, or the fact that everybody involved in the process agrees that it's a good decision?

What you fail to realize is that the University is a private institution and can take however long it wants to when giving exams. That isn't cheating. Playing by the University's own rules to give students a little extra time doesn't let them gain new information - it lets them work through problems without as much of a time crunch and actually prove they know the material."

2021-06-05 17:51:20,wallstreetbets,"I'm just here for the blowies.

2021-06-05 18:58:44,wallstreetbets,I like the stock
2021-06-05 17:56:53,wallstreetbets,"My Wendy's never has BBQ sauce. Only ranch. 

Count me out."
2021-06-05 18:57:38,wallstreetbets,"The correct process of buying through robinhood (because of the instant margin) would be to place limit orders for .05 right? It says ""there are no sellers"". Am I correct to assume at some point there may be and that's what we're banking on?"
2021-06-05 19:59:36,wallstreetbets,"It has been flirting in the lower 20s for a while now , I’ll give you that … but idk … I’ll wait another week or so to see I what happens …"
2021-06-05 18:13:06,wallstreetbets,I've been long on thus bad boy since 18. Good stock
2021-06-05 19:36:38,wallstreetbets,New burger idea.. the Stonkinator! With tendies piled up to the moon !
2021-06-05 19:38:07,wallstreetbets,Plus they got their snarky twitter roasting thing...dammit! I'm in!
2021-06-05 17:29:56,wallstreetbets,Missed out on BB and AMC. I like what im seeing with your analysis. Lets short it.
2021-06-05 19:20:54,wallstreetbets,Change Wendy to a hotter girl and I might be in.
2021-06-05 18:32:27,wallstreetbets,"Wendys is so gross I'd rather lose money than invest in them. 

You retards have never had a friend that has worked at one before huh."
2021-06-05 18:14:09,wallstreetbets,In for 72
2021-06-05 18:33:11,wallstreetbets,The burgers are horrible. No way I’m investing in that.
2021-06-05 19:46:27,wallstreetbets,"I need my burgers round, they give me an option for that amd I'm in. Square burgers feel even more industrial than the McGarbage."
2021-06-05 17:47:34,wallstreetbets,Pamp it
2021-06-05 18:35:27,wallstreetbets,I usually give them 20%
2021-06-05 19:01:57,wallstreetbets,"With all the money earned from behind a Wendy’s dumpster used to buy FD’s, why not own Wendy’s stock. Makes good sense."
2021-06-05 18:40:34,wallstreetbets,🦈🦈🦈📈📈📈🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-05 19:06:53,wallstreetbets,Derrick?
2021-06-05 19:52:15,wallstreetbets,good one dad
2021-06-05 18:56:28,wallstreetbets,I like getting a Dave’s triple and eating it without the bun like a savage. Fuck it I’m in.
2021-06-05 18:02:57,wallstreetbets,"But, maybe, if we all buy. They'll create a WSB sauce to go with all our tendies."
2021-06-05 18:34:28,wallstreetbets,When we do a wsb hostile takeover we'll put bbq sauce on the vote or  else we oust the board
2021-06-05 19:00:57,wallstreetbets,"Yea, if you were to do market buy you will get it filled st the $0.20 ask instead. But you won't be able to buy options until Monday open"
2021-06-05 17:38:24,wallstreetbets,"It hasn’t started yet, what are you on about"
2021-06-05 18:52:28,wallstreetbets,What are you talking about? They’re one of the only main fast food places with fresh never frozen beef that isn’t pink slime. Their turn around from cow to hamburger is like 48 hours. Tastes pretty bomb too. I’m in.
2021-06-05 18:39:43,wallstreetbets,I’ll uh have 2 double double with a biggy fry and 99 cent frosty.   Water for my drink.  lol
2021-06-05 18:07:40,wallstreetbets,Bop it.
2021-06-05 18:52:04,wallstreetbets,"Sum a bich, i am in!"
2021-06-05 19:58:32,wallstreetbets,Then they can afford to get you a nicer dumpster for you to blow randos behind
2021-06-05 19:35:38,wallstreetbets,Ape sauce made from real apes
2021-06-05 17:40:30,wallstreetbets,Let me put on my clown mask.
2021-06-05 18:14:05,wallstreetbets,Twist it
2021-06-05 19:40:02,wallstreetbets,Ape sauce wouldn't be the worst thing I've put in my mouth at a Wendy's
2021-06-05 19:09:34,wallstreetbets,Damn downvoted for that? Anonymous bitch
2021-06-05 18:24:47,wallstreetbets,Milk it
2021-06-05 18:29:54,wallstreetbets,Cuck it
2021-06-05 18:36:31,wallstreetbets,Short it
2021-06-05 19:20:15,wallstreetbets,Shoot it
2021-06-05 19:21:02,wallstreetbets,Kill your parents
2021-06-05 19:22:06,wallstreetbets,Cut em
2021-06-05 19:41:15,wallstreetbets,Slit it
2021-06-05 19:53:45,wallstreetbets,Cook it
2021-06-05 19:36:39,wallstreetbets,"Long BB, short PP"
2021-06-05 18:02:50,wallstreetbets,"Every single news article on BB is shitting all over its current valuation and taking about how unsustainable the current stock price is..

If that’s not a wallstreetbets bull sign, I’m not sure what is."
2021-06-05 17:47:11,wallstreetbets,I can't fucking read just tell me what berries to buy
2021-06-05 18:09:20,wallstreetbets,All I got from this was to YOLO my money into BB.
2021-06-05 18:44:49,wallstreetbets,"I bought at the top, come for me.  currently down 48%"
2021-06-05 17:51:02,wallstreetbets,You do realize the 23.69 figure is daily short volume so if a MM opens a short position @ 16  closes it at 15.90 in the same day it adds to that daily short volume but not the short interest since it was covered. The short interest are the shares that haven't closed out.
2021-06-05 19:12:00,wallstreetbets,Can I touch your BBs?
2021-06-05 17:10:47,wallstreetbets,So what you're saying is buy BB before the price sky rockets? Got it
2021-06-05 17:17:48,wallstreetbets,Idk what this means i just know blackberries taste good and they fuel my huge chimpanzee testosterone makers.
2021-06-05 18:49:37,wallstreetbets,Lots of words good
2021-06-05 18:03:04,wallstreetbets,So what youre saying is sell the house to buy BB then buy another house next Friday?
2021-06-05 18:46:04,wallstreetbets,I see BB I like it 💎
2021-06-05 18:53:53,wallstreetbets,you will never see 13$ again. it was the dipest price. I will reload at 4am on Monday morning.​
2021-06-05 19:03:04,wallstreetbets,BB to the moon
2021-06-05 17:26:53,wallstreetbets,Bought 116 shares at 17 in January. Hope I can at least break even
2021-06-05 17:23:07,wallstreetbets,We also know and have confirmation that HF sell naked shorts to further drive the price down of a stock.
2021-06-05 17:46:55,wallstreetbets,But what will trigger the margin calls?
2021-06-05 18:37:36,wallstreetbets,Can’t wait for 2 day mega green days next week I’d surely capitalize on em
2021-06-05 18:03:51,wallstreetbets,What’s the news on. AMC
2021-06-05 18:40:11,wallstreetbets,WKHS!
2021-06-05 19:41:01,wallstreetbets,BB is just a hedge distraction to keep you out of gme/amc!
2021-06-05 18:01:30,wallstreetbets,Bollocks
2021-06-05 18:01:30,wallstreetbets,Bollocks!
2021-06-05 17:46:59,wallstreetbets,So what your saying is buy and squeeze $RMED.
2021-06-05 19:17:51,wallstreetbets,They are not wrong. Not so much with BB book value is three bucks but AMC is bankrupt. Well they still had 5 billion in deferred rent obligations and last week had two different share offerings. That will prolong their bankruptcy for a year.
2021-06-05 18:06:21,wallstreetbets,"The black ones, theyre pretty cheap right now but theyre gonna be really expensive in a week or two"
2021-06-05 18:39:10,wallstreetbets,i am all in on $gme bananas are commonly the better bank for your buck
2021-06-05 19:37:30,wallstreetbets,Way ahead of you. Can’t wait to enjoy my sweet sweet berries.
2021-06-05 19:04:38,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-06-05 18:25:16,wallstreetbets,Do you know what is the current short interest?
2021-06-05 17:19:36,wallstreetbets,From what I have seen average case PT is $25.
2021-06-05 17:22:46,wallstreetbets,BB good for PP

2021-06-05 19:21:16,wallstreetbets,Yes sir. This is how it works
2021-06-05 19:19:04,wallstreetbets,Marked for stupidity
2021-06-05 18:13:03,wallstreetbets,You could’ve broken even or even small profit Thursday morning high at 20 why didn’t you?
2021-06-05 17:30:23,wallstreetbets,I bought 30shares for 15.09 on Thursday and sold for 14.00 on Friday to buy more calls.
2021-06-05 18:55:43,wallstreetbets,and where is your „confirmation“?
2021-06-05 19:15:23,wallstreetbets,"They can’t fight all of these fires at once. GME and AMC are going to break them this week, and I think BB is going to be along for the ride."
2021-06-05 19:46:39,wallstreetbets,Really?
2021-06-05 18:23:21,wallstreetbets,The dingle bberry's are a very tasty tasty dip indeed 😋👌🏿plus they get larger the longer you hold them
2021-06-05 19:57:58,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-05 18:27:39,wallstreetbets,"No one knows the daily short interest day to day since it's only required to be self reported every 2 weeks per regulation. Any day to day short interest report is only an estimate by companies like s3, ortex ,fintel, etc."
2021-06-05 19:09:15,wallstreetbets,I go to WMT and get some BB for the PP right now.

2021-06-05 19:43:00,wallstreetbets,I’ll wait for Monday and see where the market is before buying calls ….
2021-06-05 19:42:47,wallstreetbets,I read it on the internet it has to be true.
2021-06-05 18:29:46,wallstreetbets,Thanks 🦍
2021-06-05 18:42:01,wallstreetbets,https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch
2021-06-05 18:47:27,wallstreetbets,I know it's a touchy topic but Does anyone know or have a guess at target for BB? I'm averaged down to 18.24. bring the Bull run lol.
2021-06-05 19:20:39,wallstreetbets,"Yep, for the latest one in May, the reporting period begins May 28th short sellers have to report their positions by 6/2 6PM and is then published 6/9. That means the earliest numbers are at least 9 trading days out of date and that number is what people use for reference up til 6/24 which is the next dissemination date ."
2021-06-05 19:11:57,wallstreetbets,If it cracks anything above 20 im out lmao
2021-06-05 19:47:26,wallstreetbets,I don't know why people are downvoting you... I bought in at 17 and have decided to hold for a long while no matter what after I missed out on GME or AMC... But you'll still be making money and it's a smart investment strategy. Someone has to sell eventually and everyone has different levels of profit that will make them happy for a trade. People being this way pushed me away from this sub and investing in the meme stocks for a long time and it will continue to push away others because retards in this sub (not the good kind of retards) can't understand people having different financial goals than themselves and will shit on anyone or anything different than their own goal.
2021-06-05 17:09:03,wallstreetbets,You glorious bastard 🍇🦍🚀🍌

please tell me you dont actually think thats a symmetrical triangle

rule 7 is no bullshitting - please dont post technical analysis if you have no idea what you are doing - it's misleading and can fuck over a lot of people

clearly many have no idea judging by the upvotes/awards"
2021-06-05 17:07:38,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain why bb is a safe play? Obv id love for it to be successful short term but would also be willing to wait. I have 160 shares in it rn bc I’m 16 and have money to play with and honestly am willing to hold as long as I eventually get it back.
2021-06-05 19:13:25,wallstreetbets,Didn’t read. You saying BB to the moon?

2021-06-05 18:26:20,wallstreetbets,I feel like a similar situation is happening with AMC. All a big case of FUD.

I think the market tab says, buy no matter what the price is at the opening, but not sure what the difference is between stop and stop limit? I'm using Schwab"

2021-06-05 19:19:50,wallstreetbets,This appears to be his first and only post. From an account that's 5 days old.  If these bots work tho then my gamble could still pay off?
2021-06-05 19:55:50,wallstreetbets,"OP is talking out of his ass and this post is nonsense. Why would ""there's buying pressure at $14"" indicate that $38 per share is a reasonable short-term price target? This is just him telling people what they want to hear."
2021-06-05 19:16:04,wallstreetbets,This is the biased confirmation I needed.
2021-06-05 18:46:19,wallstreetbets,Yes! 100% and a fair few commenters seem to be in the same boat
2021-06-05 19:23:47,wallstreetbets,It's a 5 day old account and only has 1 post.  Bot??
2021-06-05 17:54:19,wallstreetbets,Safe play?  Son this is a casino.

I'm in for $5000, buying more Monday morning if that makes you feel any better.  Only invest what you can afford to lose though."
2021-06-05 17:29:54,wallstreetbets,"BlackBerry has been a reputable company for decades, and even survived their flagship product going obsolete. It'll be a good stock to hold onto for years, even if it doesn't spike in value immediately."
2021-06-05 17:39:32,wallstreetbets,"It's absolutely not a safe play, it's a short term hold. Even that is waning. If you want real cyber security plays look into Crowd Strike, Z scaler, Rapid7, Palo Alto Networks."

2021-06-05 18:29:29,wallstreetbets,"Been checking a lot of comments to BB posts, and there's this pattern of a lot of recent low carma accounts talking completely nonsense price targets..."

2021-06-05 19:23:01,wallstreetbets,"I was thinking about this too. There’s a lot of brand new accounts all talking about meme stocks other than AMC/GME - it’s almost like they’re up to something. And couple that with a post I was reading about how a lot of the GME/AMC posts were disappearing on Thursday/Friday . . . who’s to say?

I smell something fishy though."

2021-06-05 16:47:16,wallstreetbets,"In my humble opinion this stock is for 2024. Why? Listen to Rogans interview with Rick Doblin of MAPS, the psychedelic research institute. He’s saying at a minimum ecstasy will be legal for prescription come 2023, and psilocybin by 2024. Which in my opinion mindmed is known for lsd and mushrooms (psilocybin). Needless to say but this is a long term hold. Very promising future.

Edit: transparency matters to me. I have over 1K shares."

2021-06-05 17:04:42,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, but it's like $3/share right now. You could buy quite a few shares with minimal investment. Why not get in it now?"
2021-06-05 18:34:24,wallstreetbets,Agreed it’s long term. We are still in the early stages of clinical research and public acceptance. I listen to the psychedelics today podcast also to help me gain some understanding of how the studies are conducted. Shit sounds complicated and frustrating to get anything done. The ceo even says he’s not interested in short term performance. 3-5 years before they produce anything. That being said we’re all in it because we believe in what they are doing and the healing potential of the substances

2021-06-05 16:55:31,wallstreetbets,Friday's closing price was $3.20 an they have >380M shares outstanding. That's slightly over $1bn.

2021-06-05 18:43:34,wallstreetbets,True.
2021-06-05 18:43:06,wallstreetbets,I believe they have it but at a micro level. From what I heard in an interview with the CEO and Kevin O’Leary was that they eventually want to train other doctors to administer therapy. Look at it sorta like teledoc but for shrooms.

2021-06-05 18:54:52,wallstreetbets,Google: mindmed adds chief development officer with fda phase 2 psilocybin clinical trial experience.
2021-06-05 18:56:35,wallstreetbets,Looks early but promising.
2021-06-05 19:16:16,wallstreetbets,So he has experience with it. Hopefully he's the guy to bring it to trial for MNMD for the first time. I think that's the one with the best medicinal potential so it's too bad they aren't already in on it
2021-06-05 19:18:31,wallstreetbets,"Give it time. At least they’re highly interested in it. From all the interviews I’ve seen, it looks like mushrooms will be the most highly sought after program. LSD is also a good sign going forward."

2021-06-05 15:45:08,wallstreetbets,Bought in at 20.50 and have had nothing but red. It’s trending up so I think it’ll get back up but holding a lot longer than I initially wanted to do

2021-06-05 17:57:28,wallstreetbets,They new SUV looks great and seems to be really affordable. Good partners with Magna and Foxconn will likely allow higher initial quality than Tesla had. They have already quite a lot of reservations. Lot of institutional investors as well. Could be a great investment at the current price.
2021-06-05 15:59:48,wallstreetbets,Worked for porsche and we could never sell any fiskers they always just sat in the lot driven a few and I wasn't impressed for the price.

2021-06-05 18:14:25,wallstreetbets,All I know is Fiskers don't make noise when they start up.
2021-06-05 18:36:54,wallstreetbets,Fisker is also one of the most shorted stocks

2021-06-05 16:04:47,wallstreetbets,You forgot the most important thing IMO - they signed a deal with Foxconn and without a doubt will have a car that integrates with apple tech seamlessly.  Perhaps this is the apple car tech everyone is waiting for.
2021-06-05 17:35:16,wallstreetbets,I don’t think of it at all
2021-06-05 18:03:12,wallstreetbets,Complete scam. Not to mention what happened to other companies he has been involved in. He is a snake oil salesman who made it big thx to shareholders. I agree we will never see production cars from them.

2021-06-05 16:12:52,wallstreetbets,I would stay in both as AMC success gives traction to heavily shorted stocks and WKHS happens to have the highest SI in the entire market. Not financial advice btw 🚀.

2021-06-05 16:16:48,wallstreetbets,TY! I like to diversify anyways.  I do have a stop loss at a 1 cent profit so if that happens I'll probably go AMC or wait until WKHS is upward trending.

2021-06-05 19:07:37,wallstreetbets,I’m holding long-term if needed! Made the mistake of selling stocks way too early at first sign of loss a year ago. Not gonna make that mistake again.
2021-06-05 15:30:47,wallstreetbets,78% isn't YOLO.  But good luck!  I'm in at $9.75 for 100.
2021-06-05 18:04:03,wallstreetbets,BB is long term!  Below $100 is a dip.  -not a financial advice.

2021-06-05 14:59:35,wallstreetbets,Same to much hype for it not to go up . You’ll get your money back eventually as long as you don’t sell . Bb is expected to have increased value in the coming years . I bought premarket 1000 shares for like 19+ . Averaged down to like 18 lol
2021-06-05 15:14:41,wallstreetbets,"-$2.56k here, hopefully with the amount of people we have buying it’ll go up 10% on Monday atleast"

2021-06-05 16:02:16,wallstreetbets,Me too. Had I held out one more fucking day I'd be sitting pretty.  Sold 1000 shares of MVIS for a 2k loss to buy 1000 shares of BB only to watch it tank.  Then ofcourse the next day mvis goes up $4 a share.  Unfuckingbeleiveable!

2021-06-05 17:44:19,wallstreetbets,This is key.
2021-06-05 15:51:34,wallstreetbets,Lmao that's like 10k Canadian... You expect 1 million people to yolo 10k into BB at these prices??
2021-06-05 17:54:47,wallstreetbets,They are unstoppable
2021-06-05 17:55:27,wallstreetbets,Especially with there diversifying into the security markets and they have lots of room for growth overall.
2021-06-05 19:35:26,wallstreetbets,"How when the whole world is boutta open up and people will be going back to movies like never before.

In contrast wtf kinda magic can bb come up with to turn the tide?"
2021-06-05 14:47:48,wallstreetbets,"100 @ 19$ I’ll never sell it, because IDGAF"
2021-06-05 17:59:02,wallstreetbets,"Price will not be the same.

Edit: or am i not getting your question right. You bought ten BB shares for a total of $130 and are wondering if that value can be different by Monday, right?

Edit 2: Forgot it's Saturday. You probably just placed an order to execute a buy for whatever price the market will open at. You were just seeing the price of ~$13 the market closed at. Besides that you might wanna delete that order and get a little bit more comfortable with the whole trading topic. Otherwise $130 is not that much, but since i don't know your financial background only you know if you can afford to lose it."
2021-06-05 19:06:04,wallstreetbets,"That order did not execute yet. You just put in the order and it will go off at the market price when the market owns, so you have no idea what you'll be paying. However, buying at open is a bad idea 90% of the time, as is selling at close. I would recommend trying to get in about 30 minutes to an hour after open as the price usually drops to start the day. **USUALLY**"
2021-06-05 19:04:44,wallstreetbets,Is

It was at $11 last week, iirc."
2021-06-05 15:15:58,wallstreetbets,The Avatar has returned
2021-06-05 15:46:33,wallstreetbets,BB is a long term play. Sitting on leaps $15 and $20. All this short-term hype is a distraction.

Only smart human beings who realize decent gains and sadly way more people who will be bagholding or selling at a loss because of greed. Simple as that!"
2021-06-05 19:16:56,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the reply. I’ll take a look at it Monday and reconsider.
2021-06-05 15:48:25,wallstreetbets,That is the way . Lol people talk about dd . You can literally put any stock I. Google and look up the stock forecast and see where it’s projected to go . Takes 5 seconds
2021-06-05 16:17:55,wallstreetbets,What is dd?
2021-06-05 15:50:52,wallstreetbets,"Seriously. 

This entire subreddit has become ""XXX is the next short squeeze!"" as if that is our sole purpose here. I get it, its exciting...but BB has been discussed here for a year as a long-term play lol. Maybe it squeezes, maybe it doesn't. It's still looking like a good long-term play."

Been in since October last year , holding good size bag, was able to survive this drop...
But... To all  stated above, want to add that next week has a largest open interest of Call options strike $1.5 since the beginning of the SNDL history!!!!

And another thing - heavy share count now does not matter.  
That's exactly the moment when we, the bag holders have consumed the greater part of the shares available to short.  
And another thing - due to the SSR, short sellers can't commit new sales during the following trading day if the SP lost 10% during the previous day, except an ""uptick"".  Not sure what now can be considered an uptick if the previous closing price day before the drop was 1.49.

2021-06-05 13:47:09,wallstreetbets,"https://whalewisdom.com/stock/sndl-2

Speaking to the short interest point, there are MaSSIVE short positions being reported by the same large firms just in options holdings alone. The stock hasn’t even begun to pop off given what we’re seeing with other stocks being shorted by the same firms. They will soon be unable to keep up with margin requirements, making it likely this stock will see some serious movement.

I like and support the company long term as well, so I wouldn’t mind if I had to bag hold at any point. Feels much more comfortable than flipping a stock like AMC"
2021-06-05 14:25:11,wallstreetbets,Ok so I’ll buy some more BB.

2021-06-05 14:44:29,wallstreetbets,Can we.share this post to.r/SNDL ?
2021-06-05 15:31:59,wallstreetbets,"Not sure on this... My $$ would be on ACB in say a year from now.  They seem so much further ahead and mature, in a pretty immature market segment. Only 200m shares outstanding - compared to 1.9B !! SNDL could def be a fun stock to day trade though.

ACB partners with legit next-level plant biotech companies like 22nd century, to develop the highest quality and perhaps even more important: consistency of grow, on a mass scale. They are seriously on the cutting edge of science. SNDL seems to have a rep for being much lower quality and consistency (just a general observation)

I am relatively new to the mj stock arena, so I guess consider this a casual observers opinion and I'm still fairly early in formulating a plan on how I want to invest in these types of companies.

And I wish no ill-will in any of my comment. SNDL may emerge as the clear leader, and if so then kudo's to you for capitalizing on it! I'm just not there yet."
2021-06-05 15:28:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm not convinced by SNDL. Yes it's super shorted and manipulated, plus the legalisation of pot in the US could mean the sky's the limit. But at the moment it's a company that is known to need more capital, and probably a lot. It means major dilution. And if shorts know major dilution is coming there is simply no need for them to close their position... Just wait until dilution and the price comes down by itself. I think there are far more bullish arguments for a host of other companies to be honest."
2021-06-05 17:51:21,wallstreetbets,Does this DD mean I'm too late to buy more cheap shares on Monday?
2021-06-05 18:53:49,wallstreetbets,1000 shares at .95. Holding firm. Will probably go in big with my AMC profits on monday if shares stay around $1

2021-06-05 13:55:32,wallstreetbets,Well said. The shadow short interest that can be found in the option market can be huge.
2021-06-05 14:12:35,wallstreetbets,I definitely agree with you some big movement 🔜
2021-06-05 15:36:55,wallstreetbets,"Don't sweat it, I was in 2023 .5s @ .03/per.. those are up 75% compared to the .5s I have for July, up 1500%

Leaps require volatility to really make a move, but with legalization looming, regardless if A or B pot stock is going to benefit from it - they're all gonna rip.. 

You made a safe play, and an inexpensive one at that.. you'll be fine friend."
2021-06-05 13:56:37,wallstreetbets,You should be fine in the long run but equity is the way to play it imo. But going out to 2023 you should be all good. Could really take off
2021-06-05 13:56:31,wallstreetbets,Theta gang gunna gape you brother... you clearly have no idea what you’re doing
2021-06-05 13:45:55,wallstreetbets,"I agree it’s manipulated but mostly by institutions that make premiums by keeping the stock flat while they accumulate. If you buy equity here it should kill it over nearly any holding period imo. Doesn’t mean if it triples you shouldn’t take some off. But a year or two from now I expect it to be higher than any peak. I bought FCEL and BNGO as investments way under $1 and they both hit over $10 and are going places long term. If you find a quality company, stick with it."
2021-06-05 15:10:45,wallstreetbets,Only stock I’ve heard by everyone to get but only moves from .7 to 1.5.
2021-06-05 16:51:23,wallstreetbets,"From my limited understanding, they would only reverse split if they can't keep their stock above $1 for 10 consecutive days to avoid de-listing from the nasdaq, they have until November 22 I believe."
2021-06-05 15:58:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but they also have a very big debt compare Sundial, if I would pick I would refer Sundial, Hexo, or Tilray than ACB"
2021-06-05 15:45:11,wallstreetbets,"Have them too.... As well as CGC APHA and tons of US ""selected single penny stonks"" 
Do believe they Legalize it to the end of this month."
2021-06-05 13:42:21,wallstreetbets,I have both!!!
2021-06-05 14:14:42,wallstreetbets,"Woooohoooand 6-7 it is! Well, it will take 3 weeks or possibly even less!  SNDL is on a great foundation. 600m by 3:00! Rock it!"
2021-06-05 16:38:37,wallstreetbets,Convincing argument.
2021-06-05 18:31:25,wallstreetbets,More like 420 Japanese Yen.
2021-06-05 14:00:15,wallstreetbets,"I’m learning yes Mr Obvious, glad you felt the need to state that.. 👍🏾👍🏾 theta is .0003 tho so I’m str8 on that regard"
2021-06-05 18:18:48,wallstreetbets,"True but SNDL has absolutely crushed their shareholders with repeated dilution. Again, look at shares outstanding for these 2 companies.

ACB seems to have taken a more shareholder friendly path to servicing debt - and yes I'm aware they are going to be selling $200m at-the-market shares to raise funds. Prudent is ok. Excessive is troublesome. The real question is when can any of these guys become profitable???"
2021-06-05 14:14:50,wallstreetbets,"Woooohoooand 6-7 it is! Well, it will take 3 weeks or possibly even less!  SNDL is on a great foundation. 600m by 3:00! Rock it!"
2021-06-05 18:21:46,wallstreetbets,"You'd think the blatant manipulation and historically poor performance of the stock would be convincing enough. But we're dealing with an army of retards here, so you've got to water it down for them."
2021-06-05 14:05:48,wallstreetbets,"I mean sure, I’m just saying, even if the price slowly moves up as you get closer to expiration, the price of the contract will never move 🤷🏻‍♂️"
2021-06-05 14:06:58,wallstreetbets,I mean thank u for that knowledge.. definitely didn’t know it in that aspect.. but I guess it’s a learning lesson
2021-06-05 15:12:17,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, no problem. Have you taken a look at r/options? They were very helpful when I first started trading a few years ago. Them, and some options YouTube videos where I could actually visualize what it was that they were saying. Those were all incredibly helpful and I credit them all with my options success."
2021-06-05 17:28:47,wallstreetbets,I follow them yes will pay more attention to it
2021-06-05 13:52:15,wallstreetbets,"Idea of potential risk for going all in: you lose it all.

I’m also going to be utilizing bull put spreads on spy as I see upward momentum in the coming weeks. Really a great understated strategy, pretty easy to double your input capital as long as there isn’t a market collapse within the time frame.

I typically close spreads at 50% profit to lock in gains, unless I’m confident it’ll continue to 100% ."
2021-06-05 13:33:14,wallstreetbets,"Why a spread? The lower option is a hedge against the underlying dropping like a rock. If you aren't afraid of that, a simple CC will do."
2021-06-05 13:56:22,wallstreetbets,A simple covered call would do but I’m not a fan of the returns on the CC vs the bull put spreads. Or is it the same?
2021-06-05 16:10:30,wallstreetbets,30k is only a good amount if you are under 30 but it doesn't sound like you will have that problem much longer.
2021-06-05 15:08:10,wallstreetbets,If you're gonna be a degenerate with SPX do it with /ES instead for better margin requirements and use naked puts not spreads so you can rescue yourself from temporarily dips
2021-06-05 13:29:24,wallstreetbets,"Why SPX instead of SPY or any other index, etf, or fund?"
2021-06-05 13:54:26,wallstreetbets,Happy trading my friend.
2021-06-05 17:03:03,wallstreetbets,Better hope inflation doesnt come back to high.
2021-06-05 15:05:38,wallstreetbets,Bro SPX _is the index SPY tracks_ lmao
2021-06-05 13:30:31,wallstreetbets,Because of tax benefits
2021-06-05 17:41:05,wallstreetbets,"Numbers are Thursday, plenty of time to scalp"
2021-06-05 15:11:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah lol I forgot and was thinking of the various etf's and such like SPXU, SPXT, etc."
2021-06-05 13:34:22,wallstreetbets,"Well, afaik S&P goes up on average 7% YoY. So as long as you retire on a good year and not a bad one, you should be good. However, in terms of taxes, I think if you use a roth acct, then your investments within the acct are tax-free. This should include stock gains and dividends, but I'm not a tax expert. This is all info I just stumbled across along various subs. Grain of salt and all that."
2021-06-05 13:55:17,wallstreetbets,I’m going to have to look into a Roth account and what comes with it. Hopefully no wars are on the horizon or another economically collapsing event
2021-06-05 12:57:44,wallstreetbets,"Solid, watching"
2021-06-05 13:37:57,wallstreetbets,150 6/18 40c. Jacked to the tits for Tuesday.
2021-06-05 14:31:41,wallstreetbets,500 shares my self and 100 contacts 20k worth ! Am ready for next week on pr see what happens is a hidden gem right now
2021-06-05 16:02:34,wallstreetbets,"Have shares and July 30 and Dec 40 calls.
This will smash it this year as a recovery play.

40 will be the new floor after earnings"
2021-06-05 18:42:28,wallstreetbets,"The only bear case I can think of is they mentioned in their JPM webinar that they had to shut a number of stores down for 1-3 days during the Texas ice storm. However, I just view this as a delay of sales and not loss of sales. There is the risk of them having their inventory supplies stunted by this and a potential loss of goods due to damage as well. Bull perspective on this is that the Texas ice storm could have created a huge surge in sales as Texans replace their own damaged goods. 

Position: 200 shares @ $30.30. 7/16 30c, 40c and 45c’s."
2021-06-05 15:07:27,wallstreetbets,"I would give an award but all my money is in ASO and I can't afford the awards. If this comes through I will be buying some Reddit awards and giving you an award post earnings. I'm all in on ASO. 500 shares, 10 35 calls and 20 40 calls along with five December calls for 45. I am terrified and might chicken out before earnings by selling half Monday afternoon. Who knows."
2021-06-05 17:22:30,wallstreetbets,"The 1400 stimmy + insane gun and ammo prices/sales will probably show themselves in the earnings on Tuesday. Q4 '20 EPS were $1.09, and most retailers earnings are up in Q1 '21 compared to Q4 '20, so reasonably an EPS of $1.25 to $2.00 seems like a likely range, higher than the analyst consensus of $0.84. Can't wait for earnings and lets ride this bitch to the moon!"
2021-06-05 19:06:08,wallstreetbets,"I’m also a fan and have options for 6/18, but I doubt the California decision will make any difference. First, the closest ASO is in Missouri. Second, there’s a stay on the court decision pending appeal by the Attny Gen which he will clearly file."
2021-06-05 13:50:39,wallstreetbets,Kreacher has been watching
2021-06-05 15:00:08,wallstreetbets,Love the stock. Love the chart.
2021-06-05 15:48:47,wallstreetbets,111 shares @31.33 and I wish I bought three times that
2021-06-05 14:08:42,wallstreetbets,"great dd thanks for your time, all i needed was rockets though."
2021-06-05 14:34:26,wallstreetbets,"How do you do fellow ASO fan. I only have one 6/18 30 Call, but wishing I bought more."

2021-06-05 15:50:57,wallstreetbets,Been saying this since I bought at $7
2021-06-05 15:34:22,wallstreetbets,Holding 1677 shares (the brilliance of reverse split) and loosing like 80%. Doubled down recently. Should reach mid $30s with us and Europe legalization. They finally got rid off the corrupt top management. And they are Big in Hemp. 🚀💎🙌
2021-06-05 14:20:56,wallstreetbets,Holding my 45 shares
2021-06-05 14:29:21,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been holding 10000 shares since mid 2020. With us legalization, it’s an easy win."

2021-06-05 12:32:10,wallstreetbets,Their revenue is consistently dropping in a growing market…
2021-06-05 12:52:53,wallstreetbets,Just buy $TLRY tilray
2021-06-05 16:48:03,wallstreetbets,TLRY > shit > SNDL/ACB
2021-06-05 14:53:30,wallstreetbets,Why are you comparing the market cap to tilray lmfao
2021-06-05 16:21:41,wallstreetbets,ACB sucks. I cut my losses a long time ago after looking at the fundamentals. They’re deep in the hole and most of the competition seems to be in a far better place for when federal legalization is on the table.
2021-06-05 12:37:06,wallstreetbets,I lost an entire IRA on $ACB when I purchased long calls at its peak.
2021-06-05 18:08:33,wallstreetbets,"ACB is a disappointment. Weak numbers, with or without covid."
2021-06-05 14:53:57,wallstreetbets,Aurora actually sucks buy literally any other weed company

2021-06-05 13:07:51,wallstreetbets,Time to double down. Don't be a pussy.
2021-06-05 14:24:17,wallstreetbets,They do one like once a year I think everyone on this sub has lost money in ACB at some point
2021-06-05 19:44:48,wallstreetbets,not yet but on my way
2021-06-05 19:52:24,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget the sell more shares and dilute current shareholders before the reverse split step. I hate ACB

2021-06-05 17:25:10,wallstreetbets,Same. Threw 2500 at them. Already up 20%
2021-06-05 12:29:52,wallstreetbets,So what? Are you really a BOT is the question HAHAAA
2021-06-05 12:51:21,wallstreetbets,...what dude? It's not that hard to look up the date of a stocks last earnings and then the stocks chart that week. Go do that and try again.
2021-06-05 12:50:10,wallstreetbets,What are you talking about? How did it tank ?
2021-06-05 12:55:37,wallstreetbets,March 30- earnings $26 - April 5 $31
2021-06-05 14:30:05,wallstreetbets,"I played last earnings, it tanked the open after earnings, share lockup expired and I had a guh moment, but it went on a bull run after that. Wish I doubled down on that dip, IV was crushed, 30cs went to all time lows, missed out."
2021-06-05 14:31:20,wallstreetbets,I bought few calls with exp month out so hopefully I will be okay

2021-06-05 15:17:27,wallstreetbets,As soon as I saw the interview. I thought that was on purpose. He did not react in any way like it was an accident. I dont doubt it was a message to the apes. Hold ur bastards!
2021-06-05 15:30:58,wallstreetbets,I said this on the original video posted . Seems like he did it on purpose for whatever reason. Maybe he wanted to be “Meme” gold. Free advertising sorta deal. And he wanted us apes to think this guy fucks and in return we would fuks with his stock .
2021-06-05 16:14:02,wallstreetbets,Not sure if everyone is joking and this is funny or if they are serious and this is scary.
2021-06-05 12:46:31,wallstreetbets,"This is actually kind of brilliant, for a retard."
2021-06-05 14:58:09,wallstreetbets,"Fuck that guy.  No hidden meaning in that all the top execs were dumping personal stocks at the same time as the company was selling shares to hedge funds.  Dilution plain and simple.
Personally I dont give a fuck about the long term AMC.  I came for the squeeze, I'm staying for the squeeze, if the juice isnt worth it well the joke is on me.  I'm in at $13 low risk, high reward.
I'm in it for the money."
2021-06-05 14:58:27,wallstreetbets,“Do you guys think Q lied to us???”
2021-06-05 15:28:23,wallstreetbets,"It very well could mean ""naked shorting."" Seriously, who would not wear pants during an interview and what are the odds the camera slips?

If he got up and forgot then it was an accident but this wasnt... IMHO."

2021-06-05 16:15:13,wallstreetbets,This is legitimately schizophrenic.
2021-06-05 12:56:31,wallstreetbets,"I hope you are right.  But everyone on zoom type interviews only dresses for waist up. I’m sure I’ll get down voted but he was hired to run the company.  So keeping it afloat is his first priority.  As far as needing the option to sell more stocks, of course, when the squeeze hits, he will be able to sell enough for the companies future for decades.  So just my long term thinking if I was in his shoes."

2021-06-05 14:26:56,wallstreetbets,"And if you keep watching after 50 min camera move, AA looks to his right for a time before answering.

2021-06-05 16:52:18,wallstreetbets,"Before they go live, the questions they are asked are given to the interviewee ahead of time. If the wording is different from how it is phrased on the question sheet, they always hesitate. The reason why they are given the questions is to avoid dead air. There is nothing that causes a producer to panic like dead air as someone searches for the right answer. Or, stumbling through an answer. If a CEO looks dumb on-air, it might affect stock price.

In my experience, sometimes it's an agent (representation) or an attorney or both that gives the go ahead or the, fuck that shake - change the subject. If they are asked something that isn't on the list and it hits too close to home or is in opposition to the PR that has been prepared, that is why people walk out of interviews. So yes, his attorney (or several) were present. No question. Good catch."
2021-06-05 17:53:54,wallstreetbets,I don't know but hopefully both of us can retire early.
2021-06-05 15:27:57,wallstreetbets,I 100% wouldn’t doubt that he’d have one there even without doing something crazy like secret  messaging. Live interviews like this are liabilities more than even the Anderson tweet that got threatened for libel or whatever.

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"High SI, Fundamentally Undervalued & An Interesting Healthcare Revolution? TLDR: This company has a high short interest that is only continuing to increase according to [Ortex](https://public.ortex.com/) along with a days to cover that has essentially tripled in the last week alone. Fundamentally they are better now than ever before yet are trading at more than a 60% premium from ATHs. Shorts have hammered the stock, and I think an opportunity may have presented itself, if you all agree?

TLDR for the TLDR: This stock is good and has a higher SI than BB and has an extremely auspicious (likely to succeed) business model with innovations that guarantee and justify a price target that is nearly 4x the current share price by EOY.

(Where I got all this info will be listed)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

High SI -

Of the shares outstanding the short interest of this stock is 36M shares, 13.12% per the last settlement date, May 14th, BUT the estimated short interest according to Ortex is now 42M shares, a fairly substantial increase from the current (as of last publication) 36M short interest.

Days to cover has increased from the 1s to now 3.32 in just a few days. Which is good because it means if a run-up were to happen then the shorts would have a hard time exiting their position, making a short squeeze more auspicious.

According to [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/), the short share availability has only decreased and stayed today, indicating that very few shorts have covered today even with the price up significantly. This is because the less short shares the brokers have to lend out, the higher amount of short shares that have already been lent out, meaning that the people those short shares have been lent out to have not covered given that the short share availability has done nothing but go down and sideways all of Friday.

Not only does this stock have a high SI but it has increased recently, meaning a squeeze opportunity may be perfectly aligning.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fundamentally Undervalued -

Most high growth stocks have gotten obliterated since February 16th and this one is no different in that regard. However the fundamentals of this company have only exponentially increased with essentially zero price action reaction.

There is proven manipulation in this stock's price action (imo). Just to name a few of the catalysts the price action practically utterly ignored (ALL of these were after February 16-the peak of high growth); 2 revenue beats, 1 EPS beat, CEO and 3 C-suite members getting LEAPS with share exercisability valuing in the hundreds of millions WITH an exercise price of $7.83 which is ABOVE the current and then stock price, announcement of 5 studies that in the company's own words would act as important marketing events that would likely lead to increased sales, CFO projection of 'substantial double-digit revenue growth' along with his 20-40% YOY operating expense increase projection for the 'next few years' (According to own company estimates as far as sales and adoption profitability chances based on their numbers are likely to come at least one year before analysts are projection ((imo)), MORE bullish insider transactions in the form of the CMO picking up more LEAPS after her original one mentioned above, CEO and COO being awarded tens of millions of dollars in profit in the form of hundreds of thousands of shares 840k to be exact and as of now they have not sold any, new EXTREMELY innovative product confirmation-nanonozzle (imo), added to MSCI index, confirmation of several large sales, several studies proving 100% concordance and increased accuracy of their main product compared to 'gold standard' of the market this company is trying to disrupt, HUGE institutional ownership increase, from around 4-5% at lows up to 15.60% currently.

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12jAjUCFcVm7447LKvB4gQPg2BRT-1SxILV_2jNXpxB8/edit?usp=sharing) explains more in depth why this company is extremely fundamentally undervalued and WILL do great things in the future.

&#x200B;

Interesting Healthcare Revolution -

A higher life expectancy for everyone in the aggregate along with a better quality of life is what would happen should their goal of 'global Sap\*\*\* adoption be effectuated. 'Chemotherapeutic drug enhancements' is one of many of the revolutions that we could see specifically because of what this company does. Paraphrasing the CEO, 'we believe that the next big wave of innovation in Biology will derive from optical genome mapping', which is what **Bio-na-no Geno-mi-cs, $B-N-G-O**'s Saphyr does-optical genome mapping, and they do it better than anyone. According to the company itself, >500bp detection in SVs with Saphyr compared to the CMA, FISH, and KT competition is cost effective, requires less hands on time, and has a faster turnaround time. Not to mention it has more accurate readings and has less false positives. LOH and SNV detection are said to be in the works, currently zero of the three competing methods can detect these. Nor can FISH, CMA, or KT detect the wide range of variant classes Saphyr can.

With this knowledge, one *wonders* why Saphyr has not already been adopted in all 2,500 cytogenetic labs, most of this can be attributed to resistance of change and relatively low academic praise and exposure of Saphyr's capabilities, but with FIVE large clinical studies in the works on NIPT, postnatal screening, hematological malignancies in leukemia and lymphomas, and solid tumor research, that is sure to change all in due time. Not to mention cost per genome reducing from $450-$550 currently to $100 by at maximum 2023 (Saphyr is already cost effective, just imagine how cheap it will be compared to other methods once the price more than halves per genome). Throughput to increase by 14x from the already immense maximum of 5000 genomes per year with the current Saphyr system. Throw in in the nanonozzle release that 'may' include SNV detection and will 'fill in the gaps of what current NGS is missing', and one has a strong case to make that this company will revolutionize healthcare and the entire genomic sector as we know it.

So What? -

I hold 1623 shares and a LEAPS call option-

https://preview.redd.it/yh2v1k1lwg371.jpg?width=1397&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b7a13df39320562ae320d8845dec8c9786cd8d2b

I plan on yoloing another 10k shares in $B-N-G-O by EOY at the latest.

I will not sell anything for years. I am hodling regardless of what market headwinds come to fruition, in my mind the company will do great things but it is hard to predict when they drop PR and harder to predict when other people will react to it. There is a short squeeze on the horizon and I believe >$10 is the true current fundamental value of the company easily.

If my fellow retards want to burn the shorts of **$B-N-G-O** then I will lead the charge by yoloing in the rest of the current BP in my account-enough for about 300-400 more shares.

There IS a short squeeze on the horizon and I am willing to hodl with diamond hands for however long it takes. If WSB were to agree then I think I have an idea of [what may happen-](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nlua3m/the_fellowship_of_the_saphyr/)

LMK what y'all think - is 🚀 $B-N-G-O 🚀 next up?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Need to know terms-

Nanonozzle - innovations or product that would enable 'sequencing capabilities' along with ('maybe') single nucleotide variant detection. Basically when this releases (we don't know when) the stock price will probably go up anywhere from 30%-500% depending on how innovative it is and how much it makes NGS obsolete, which is what the C-suite has implied it will do.

NGS - next generation sequencing, competition with OGM.

OGM - optical genome mapping, what $B-N-G-O's main product -the Saphyr- does.

All my sources can be found in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12jAjUCFcVm7447LKvB4gQPg2BRT-1SxILV_2jNXpxB8/edit?usp=sharing) (use ctrl f to find them easily).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR for the TLDR for the TLDR: B-N-G-O is good fundamentally, has a high short interest, **proven** manipulation in the price action, and would be put in a more [auspicious](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/auspicious) position to **revolutionize** healthcare were we to squeeze the shorts."

If you’re thinking of enzyme/small molecule inhibitors in the “lock and key” model - knowing minute mutations in target proteins could guide chemists to much more potent and selective therapeutics.

This is why most of my portfolio is BNGO (100 shares @ 5.78 and 1 6/18 $8 Call.). Will be adding more once I graduate and am not a poor college student anymore.

Best of luck retards."

# Market Cap

***Market cap is all that matters. NOK does way more than the only real Western 5g rival $ERIC; and***

***the market cap has a lot of catching up to do. Both companies have good cashflow and turnover;***

***but NOK is positioned for all of the above, plus it can play a very strong*** **ESG** ***card.***

*This is easily a 100 bill market cap company now. But with a bit of FOMO and considering it could be at the centre of a paradigm shift... I see this as a 500 billion market cap by 2025.*

*$BB vs $NOK*

*Nokia revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2021 was $6.120B, a 12.91% increase year-over-year.*

*BlackBerry revenue for the twelve months ending February 28, 2021 was $893M, a 14.13% decline year-over-year.*

*Nokia revenue for the twelve months ending March 31, 2021 was $25.661B, a 0.61% decline year-over-year.*

*Nokia cash on hand for the quarter ending March 31, 2021 was $10.887B, a 49.65% increase year-over-year.*

# Final thought

**So NOK was once bigger than AAPL**

**AAPL is not prepared for any of the above**

**NOKIA HAS BEEN AROUND 150 YEARS**

**AAPL won't be**

I'm cool with the stock. I'll continue to hold to see if it does anything. Just want to make sure I don't get burned on my call if there's something I'm missing."

Compared to peers, thats shit! They were doing what Tesla does in the world of Tech the whole time! $59 for a telecom play that was never just a telecom play? That is like everyone that bet Amazon was only a book company...look at them now! NOK did they business without drawing attention and was forgotten about.

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC Volume Price Analysis Part 2   

Hey guys/girls/old apes/baby apes/tards and autists, 

For those of you following AMC daily, what a week, right? We have had some pretty intense price action out there and since I posted last week, I’ve been flooded with private messages from some of you guys wanting more information as we go along to help you understand where this market is going. Just to be clear, I am not your financial advisor and you really should invest based on your own analysis of the stock and risk tolerance. I know there is a lot of information going around out there and it can be confusing for people. Now more than ever, the use of technical tools helps us make choices not based on fear and greed, but on logic and the balance of probabilities. That being said, here is my view of the past week with AMC using volume and price as my guide.

&#x200B;

[Weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/zn6y8j95rg371.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b2031e3bb869df44838baf462f7657da7017937)

On the weekly chart, since the breakout from the HTF (high tight flag), we have quickly reached my initial target of 63.96$. The real body of last week’s candle is longer than the previous week’s on slightly higher volume which is normal. It means Wyckoff’s law of effort and result still suggests the price action is in harmony with its associated volume. For a stock to rise, it needs effort (represented here as volume). So here we have rising price action with rising volume which is good. I am a little bit concerned about the long upper wick on this candle, though, because this suggests there is quite some selling happening here. Could be a mix of price suppression, professionals taking money off the table, and some retail booking profits/panic selling. For sure, what this long upper wick tells me is that the bears have not given up yet and we are not out of the woods. The good news here is that the heavy resistance we found at 35$ got blown out of the water on very high volume. So whatever happens, we now have VERY HIGH support at 35-36$ (resistance becomes support when broken).  

 

[Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/ij4cvnvarg371.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=966c13ab4754a1fa66069d72fd810412c823986d)

Moving on to the daily chart, candle #1 is a very important candle. I see a very long white body with rising volume which is excellent. I want to bring your attention to candle #2. When I compare these two candles, I see that candle #1 has a way bigger body than #2 but only slightly higher volume. This tells me that bears have capitulated at these levels (35$-36$) and price could move smoothly without much resistance, which is very bullish. Keep in mind that long white candles on very high volume offer a lot of support at around half the real body if a retrace would occur (around 50$). The upper wick suggests some selling was happening here, but nothing that concerns me. Candle #3 is a black spinning top and suggests indecision by market participants. It coincided with a lot of FUD being laid out there and investors were trying to digest all the information that was being poured out by the media (by the way, trading the news is a bad idea… just saying). I like that the lower wick is longer than the upper wick which suggests more buying than selling is happening. I believe a lot of weak hands were stopped out of their positions during this day (for the newbies out there, placing your stop loss too high will most likely result in closing your positions in highly volatile stocks as you may have experienced). The spinning top closed at 51.34$, suggesting the 50$ region acted as support here. I am not surprised of this pullback because we hit around 90 on the RSI Wednesday and a lot of traders look at this indicator to book profits. Candle #4 is an inverted hammer and suggests weakness. It acts as a bearish continuation 65% of the time, but it’s really not a candle I find very reliable. Although the current price action suggests some weakness in the last 2 trading days, the good news is that the volume is dropping significantly and thus suggests this is a short-term pullback in a major uptrend (remember Wyckoff’s law of effort and result). We can confidently HOLD our long positions in this stock because the likeliest outcome is for the uptrend to resume soon once all the weak hands are weeded out of this stock. Some could argue that the start of a bull flag is being printed on the chart as well, which is good news once it breaks out to the upside.

&#x200B;

[30 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/pp0v8fdfrg371.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=35a0628428c149c40d1f0f5cf02bdc3396aeb234)

On the 30 minutes chart, candle #1 signals stopping volume with the long lower wick on the down candle at the 42$ region on above average volume. This short-term downtrend was stopped at the 40$ region with a hammer candle on high volume at #2. Shorter candle on higher volume suggests a lot of buying is happening at the 40$-42$ region and thus this is very strong support for us. Professionals were buying heavily here. 

&#x200B;

[60 minutes chart](https://preview.redd.it/1bwtebuirg371.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=81ebb4758f22c9c1802847d44e8f08c51aa0f8c2)

Lastly on the 60 minutes chart, we see in the last part of Thursday and Friday a small downtrend on declining volume suggesting divergence in Wyckoff’s law of effort and result. This downtrend is weak and will not last very long. For those who have not yet jumped on this rocket, you have another opportunity to hop in at an interesting price (currently around 48$). I still believe we are currently trading at a discount on AMC. For conservative traders, I see very strong support at 40-42$, but you could miss out on the rally if we do not retest this region. For those of you already strapped on your rocket ship seat, we HOLD THE LINE! This stock has A LOT more upside risk than downside risk at this point and we are merely in a small consolidation zone which is normal after a significant rally. Stocks do not trend in a straight line. During the whole week, I did NOT sell any of my call options even though they reached +1000% at some point. This is not the action of greed, but confidence that price action and volume support a lot more upside on this stock. Selling too soon is as bad as selling too late. I am so confident in this trade that I will be buying the dips next week to average up on my position AGAIN.

TLDR: Volume and price still in harmony. Buy the dips. Strong support at 40$-42$. Short-term downtrend in a major uptrend still intact. WE HOLD THE LINE!!!!

Cheers,

AMC 20$ 07/16C

AMC 30$ 07/16C

AMC 40$ 08/20C"

2021-06-05 11:36:59,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain what the fibonacci numbers represent, and how every time we hit a certain high, it appears to trigger a sell off? I watched one youtuber who showed that both GME in Jan and AMC this week hit a specific level of the fibonnaci and stopped, and he was speculating that the amount of 'effort' to break that level into the next level was exponentially difficult and there also might be institutional sell offs at that level too. I am learning more about Elliot Waves and the Fibinocci levels and it seems that stocks seem to hit these levels of max gain before dropping and later increasing."

2021-06-05 14:56:02,wallstreetbets,"Great job, I need some more confidence. I realize that you can’t get five straight days of record setting greens for AMC. I think we can get this to $100 in the next 1-2 weeks if we hold the line as mentioned here. This stock had a lot of randoms outside of Reddit buying shit up trying to take a ride but they were unreliable paper hands that just heard about it through someone and bought shares. They didn’t sell and buy dips, they just bought increased and sold as high as they saw. We buy dips and hold for the damn fuel to max out before we take off."

2. volume dropped the entire time the last time AMC fell off and went sideways for months 
3. capitulation is NOT bullish in this context - capitulation on a huge red candle after a massive drop would be - it's usually a key reversal signal

alright i could go on - but seriously - this is all an opinion piece and its clear you just started learning about TA

a lot of people are going to follow your information with real money"
2021-06-05 12:03:06,wallstreetbets,This is good stuff. I had a similar feeling looking at how small the volume was AH on Friday and how much the price tanked it seemed like an indicator of something that isn’t a real reflection of the sentiment.

2021-06-05 12:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Why do you assume this? Do you have an data? Plenty of volume, huge price increase, pretty indicative of covering in a squeeze scenario."
2021-06-05 11:50:11,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-05 11:42:36,wallstreetbets,"Fibonacci numbers are based on the Fibonacci ratios found in nature and thus traders use them to set price targets since some market participants believe markets are bound by the laws of nature. Personally, I only use these ratios to determine price targets in Elliot waves. I haven’t analyzed AMC with fibo ratios or Elliot wave though."
2021-06-05 13:58:06,wallstreetbets,It is my opinion that AMC just completed Wave 3 of its current EW cycle and is in the corrective wave 4 that is very close to completing before giving way to an upward moving wave 5.  Wave 3 in this case ($73 high) reached above the 261% fibonacchi extension of wave 1 (the high in Jan was the end of wave 1) which is a 10% probability and it makes sense given the extreme interest and volume in the stock. This is an outlier in terms of probabilities. When wave 5 completes the PT will be somewhere $84-110 as the highest probability and $152 being the lowest probability.
2021-06-05 12:25:47,wallstreetbets,"What he also left out is that a majority of stock trades are done by algo bots. And fib numbers are just patterns that happen to show up in the math models those bots are based on. So essentially you are normally betting on the odds of stocks moving to a specific ratio or percentage increase/decrease with all trades, not just AMC. It’s really helpful for managing risk and finding those support or resistance levels that you see on charts. You can also see when you plot them out that in some cases, you get numbers that are wider and wider apart as the ratio increases, plus there are some set percentages traders look for when booking profits or entering a trade on a bounce or after a sell off."

2021-06-05 18:59:23,wallstreetbets,"No I can’t. I don’t do fundamental analysis, only TA. Besides, the FED has made sure that we are not navigating in a normal market environment with agressive QE and low rates. Has this market made any sens in the last year ? Asking the question is answering it."
2021-06-05 12:48:40,wallstreetbets,This is a momentum trade. We are not buying the P/E ratio.
2021-06-05 14:38:43,wallstreetbets,Cool our home then. Tbh I don't really listen to her at the moment I'm too busy watching the ticker.
2021-06-05 16:21:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah dude, im Canadian and i keep the windows open all night to cool the house"
2021-06-05 14:02:50,wallstreetbets,It's always winter somewhere in the world.
2021-06-05 13:33:45,wallstreetbets,Southern Hemisphere?
2021-06-05 15:28:36,wallstreetbets,You guys are getting crayons?
2021-06-05 19:17:08,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino"
2021-06-05 15:37:37,wallstreetbets,"They went full retarded, NEVER go full retarded!"
2021-06-05 13:22:35,wallstreetbets,Do your research.
2021-06-05 11:45:21,wallstreetbets,"OK thank you for this. I was looking, given that our floor for amc will probably be high 40's on Monday, what the maximum growth _could_ be based on the Fibo number at that level. However given that there is rumor around the T+21 for GME on Wednesday 6/9 there is also a potential for a huge increase in price which might pull AMC along for the ride. So I am expecting a bullish week but was looking for some place to exercise profits. This is not financial advice."
2021-06-05 14:03:15,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this DD. This is what I was looking for. I want to learn all I can about the Fib Number and Elliot wave so I can create a realistic exit strategy and options science. There is speculation that the last wave is 6 days away from the next wave which is estimated to be this coming Wednesday, the EXACT SAME DAY as GME has it's T+21 so we can expect some volatility. 

Not financial advice. Thank you."
2021-06-05 12:30:25,wallstreetbets,"This. I am hopeful I can learn everything about this number, as it's fascinating that profits seem to _always_ happen at these numbers and a sell off or direction change happens. So if I know that 163.80 is the next fib number, I might put in sells at that number fo lock profits."
2021-06-05 12:41:39,wallstreetbets,"Yup, I also think next week should be pretty bloody. Very little support, 49 was broken pretty easily, and afterhours was even worse. I'm surprised it bounced to 43, actually."
2021-06-05 14:44:12,wallstreetbets,"This guy fucks, not now because he’s ignoring our wife but he will."
2021-06-05 19:34:19,wallstreetbets,Texas here. You open the windows and temp goes up 50 degrees
2021-06-05 16:32:43,wallstreetbets,Winter is coming
2021-06-05 14:07:59,wallstreetbets,I thought it was always 5 o' clock somewhere?
2021-06-05 14:37:09,wallstreetbets,Is that why I’m always cold?
2021-06-05 18:45:07,wallstreetbets,Had one.  Stuck it up my nose.  Not sure where it is now...
2021-06-05 15:51:41,wallstreetbets,Suck my unit
2021-06-05 14:02:20,wallstreetbets,"Ah so you have no proof or data to back up what you are claiming.

Cool."
2021-06-05 14:09:59,wallstreetbets,If that where the case I wouldn’t be typing this since time would be frozen.
2021-06-05 15:40:11,wallstreetbets,Not for you..
2021-06-05 15:26:46,wallstreetbets,Sounds like he has more data than you just saying he has none
2021-06-05 16:59:57,wallstreetbets,Volume and price increase.
2021-06-05 17:15:16,wallstreetbets,But you have no proof or data to back up saying its going down ...
2021-06-05 18:26:16,wallstreetbets,Volume and price rising is indicative of shorts covering. That's the data that backs up what the OP is claiming to refute without proof. Just wow.
2021-06-05 18:45:51,wallstreetbets,It would be if they were covering but they aren’t when more shorts are being lent out than returned still and shorts are at 99% utilization still but trying to explain anything to someone who doesn’t want to hear it doesn’t matter you have your opinion and your by your statements your stuck on it. The evidence is clear and that’s shown in the price right now. Everyone has their own research and yours is opposite of ours hope you have a nice day cause I sure am with my +328% gains see you on Monday 👍good luck
2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Does this feel like the week of January 31st to anyone else? When GME closed at 325, down from its ATH of 485, all of the ""apes"" on here were grasping at increasingly frail straws to tell themselves the everything was gonna be fine and the moon was their next stop, and then GME dipped below $50 by February 4th? Is it just me? 

Both AMC and GME peaked at/near $35 billion market cap midweek, then had a lot of action into slow bleeds to close the week at around 23 billion. Almost identical sorts of price action, as well as eerily similar volumes and the first round of panic selling before the halts. What do we think in terms of realistic price targets for AMC? Low of $15, closing EOW at around 20? Lower?"
2021-06-05 11:00:43,wallstreetbets,"This is easy. If I buy AMC $45 on Monday, it’ll easily hit $20 EOW. HOWEVER - if I don’t buy, it’ll be $150 EOW. I won’t buy, so I do my part at helping apes."
2021-06-05 10:59:35,wallstreetbets,"No, that time Robinhood stopped allowing to trade AMC and GME for their hedge fund friends. This time majority of the apes are with other brokers. This time it will be different :)"
2021-06-05 10:56:47,wallstreetbets,We got way more apes this time you can’t compare bro
2021-06-05 11:30:47,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly what will happen. Whenever the price tanks for meme stocks, and then you’re left wondering “y banana fall short?” It’s because you were too late. 

And then you have your bunch  of retards who will try to tell you “today was a bad day but tomorrow we moon” with TA and charts they draw on there padded walls and interpret to read exactly what it is they want it to say. 

I’m long on certain positions here, but I won’t deny the reality of how the game is played"
2021-06-05 11:52:39,wallstreetbets,"Everything we do here cycles.  It might’ve crested for now, but it’ll come back around in 1-3 months time.


We’ve become our own little stock trend."
2021-06-05 12:02:33,wallstreetbets,"I don’t understand why it matters (on a weekend at that!) unless you yourself have a position in either stock. 

But I’ve noticed you’ve posted bearish comments on amc frequently over the past 24 hrs so I know what you’re up to carry on sir!"
2021-06-05 10:58:40,wallstreetbets,#WHO let CRAMER in?
2021-06-05 11:05:26,wallstreetbets,"This MAY look like GME...but you are looking at the wrong part of the GME chart.  GME had a mini shoot up, then a fall, BEFORE hitting its ATH.  It did not feel like a mini shoot up at the time, but it definitely was.

And even IF you are right, which you aren't, look at GME AFTER Jan and where it is at now.  $14 stock shooting to over $400 and then to settle in the 200s...the 200s is still 5x+ where we are right now.

There are other reasons to dispel FUD like this, but I will leave it with that."
2021-06-05 11:01:39,wallstreetbets,"Well yes it feels like that, And I hope history repeats itself because I need to unload these 35 Ford contracts"
2021-06-05 11:40:43,wallstreetbets,"yes it is exactly like January....why? Because that's what waves do/feel like. This is probably wave 5 that will be the point to sell into, but most wont, as always. Will you capture your dreams for a meme?"
2021-06-05 17:37:35,wallstreetbets,Honestly I just through trailing stop limit whatever’s on my memestocks and call it a day.
2021-06-05 11:01:16,wallstreetbets,Spreading FUD. AMC is launching next week 🦍💎🚀
2021-06-05 15:01:52,wallstreetbets,"Speaking from someone who joined in January and bought all of that reaching bullshit (after a nice 80 entry point) and ended up losing money because of it. I can tell you. This is *exactly* that. It feels bizarre now. The ""why everyone talk about BB now?"" The ""FTD naked shorts will cover the data is lying"" etc. Basically the denial that last week was driven 99% by the options book getting outright fucking assaulted with amc call buying."
2021-06-05 11:11:44,wallstreetbets,"GME reached ATH on a gamma squeeze n never hit them again, AMC already gamma squeezed, and numbers show 200 million shorts covered that day. But that was only the net change in short interest, it didn’t account for new short positions taken out that day, which means a large part, at least 33% of original shorts have already covered and that’s assuming not a single new short position opened. It’s over, AMC will never get as high as it was Wednesday."
2021-06-05 12:19:13,wallstreetbets,"Go ahead downvote my first comment, y’all don’t listen to reason, literal retards."
2021-06-05 11:09:34,wallstreetbets,This guy is an AMC hater for sure. Every post you comment on you either shit on it or spread FUD.
2021-06-05 12:56:56,wallstreetbets,Judging by comparing to the past is always bound to fail.
2021-06-05 19:02:29,wallstreetbets,Is bb gonna pop Monday?
2021-06-05 12:39:05,wallstreetbets,Nope
2021-06-05 11:55:26,wallstreetbets,I see we have the same stonk skills.  Buy high sell low.
2021-06-05 12:48:07,wallstreetbets,"Jokes aside, Meme stocks typically moon on mondays from the shorts T+2 rule so they generally don't short often on Mondays plus they don't get enough bang for the buck. So the worst time to buy is Monday at 3:30 pm when the price has skyrocketed to the top. On the flipside, due to MAX PAIN, Fridays is the best time to buy when the price hits the toilet. New investors see the price on Monday and buy, and then see the drop on Friday and sell paper hands. I buy on Fridays during the Max Pain dip, and sell on Mondays/Tuesdays during the spike. This is especially true of calls. Not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor just a village idiot."
2021-06-05 12:18:21,wallstreetbets,"That’s Busch league. You have to try my new strat:

Buy puts against the meme stocks and then trying to buy in too high when they don’t go down, only for them to dip below my buy in but higher than my strike on the day they expire."
2021-06-05 14:08:56,wallstreetbets,Seriously. This is my mindset. I don’t but so you all can make money. Case in point.... bought in on February 9 with $5k. The next day it was worth $2k. Currently holding steady around $1800. Fuck me but... you’re welcome. Good luck all.
2021-06-05 12:31:21,wallstreetbets,a true champion. let us know what else you buy
2021-06-05 12:14:59,wallstreetbets,"I can just about guarantee the same!  Last night at my buddies pad he told me liquidate everything i have and put it into amc, because the stock is about to go "" hyperbolic"".

My buddy works for chase bank as a loan officer and makes a couple hundred k a year.   He""s the one that got me into stocks.

Dammit.   I know that if i buy all in, that the stock will fucking tank, but goddamn i was seeing $$$ signs again last night with this fucker.   

Well, im gonna tank your stocks motherfuckers.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and im sorry you dirty apes, but i have to take that gamble.  Buying in more monday, and its gonna fuck up your stock cause im unlucky.

Im sorry.

Please forgive :("
2021-06-05 12:09:19,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣🤣
2021-06-05 13:19:39,wallstreetbets,Yes sir I took my 12k out and went to tda
2021-06-05 10:57:43,wallstreetbets,He is really hell bent on bringing AMC down 🤣🤣🤣🤣
2021-06-05 10:58:21,wallstreetbets,"Do you? Are you sure? Or do you just have more people who are subscribing to this subreddit, who were already here last time? At the peak of GME's frenzy, this subreddit had 8 million subs and there were points were there were over 1,000,000 users here at one time. Right now we're at 110,000 online and the highest I saw during the frenzy last week was 300,000. No way is this a bigger movement than GME was."
2021-06-05 13:03:08,wallstreetbets,"At least someone understands the reality and that is why you , my friend will make it further in your investing career then most who just joined."
2021-06-05 13:04:01,wallstreetbets,"He has no life, no wife and if he had one, she'd lack the boyfriend.... Ugly as fuck...."
2021-06-05 15:53:09,wallstreetbets,Why are you commenting?
2021-06-05 10:59:24,wallstreetbets,"Been here a lot longer than you have, muchacho."
2021-06-05 11:36:42,wallstreetbets,You know stock price means diddly right? The market cap of amc to hit the 200s would be well over $100 billion which would be way higher than gme ever got to.
2021-06-05 11:29:44,wallstreetbets,Thank you😜
2021-06-05 15:52:01,wallstreetbets,Holy god this comment is retarded. Please don’t listen to this person. They’re completely wrong here.
2021-06-05 11:04:16,wallstreetbets,To 25$ puts ready to firm
2021-06-05 14:54:46,wallstreetbets,"You have absolutely no idea what your talking about. Cite your sources or shut the fuck up, we’re going to the fucking moon BBaby. And you can take that to the fucking bank there bud"
2021-06-05 15:57:41,wallstreetbets,"Because it's funny, stupid."
2021-06-05 19:17:15,wallstreetbets,"No clue. If I were a gambling man, I'd say absolutely not."
2021-06-05 13:38:44,wallstreetbets,"Im really new and appreciate that advice, hadnt heard that before🍌🍌🍌🍖"
2021-06-05 14:25:12,wallstreetbets,"But Wednesday it took the stock 120% to $73. 
Also last time GME was $145 or something on Friday after Thursday’s $70 and took it to $245 on Monday opening bell. Wednesday it hit $450 before the restrictions."
2021-06-05 14:10:41,wallstreetbets,Perhaps you should be king of the village with that share
2021-06-05 14:59:02,wallstreetbets,"I you sell high, buy lows with the gains. Pay yourself back to recover your investment and continue riding the rocket with your dip shares."
2021-06-05 12:21:38,wallstreetbets,"Dammit u are a fucking genius!  I could bleed money even faster that way!!!   Have a banana you beautiful ape!

🍌"
2021-06-05 12:31:49,wallstreetbets,Hold with us
2021-06-05 14:46:30,wallstreetbets,But if your buddy knows some things whys he still gotta boss
2021-06-05 16:20:05,wallstreetbets,"Tda blocked during January too and has has the highest payment for order flow on the books.  Am a td customer, just haven't switched because all my gme sits in td."
2021-06-05 10:59:45,wallstreetbets,Are you just replying to literally every comment that I make?
2021-06-05 11:12:24,wallstreetbets,And you didnt invest in GME dont act like you are in any way part of it
2021-06-05 11:11:39,wallstreetbets,Lmao you have been dragging AMC down during and before its peak. All your opinions here are invalid. Get out.
2021-06-05 11:00:22,wallstreetbets,My dad joined the stock market after decades of claiming its rigged. This event got him in. He ain’t fucking selling.
2021-06-05 11:00:06,wallstreetbets,I'm aware you called the bottom in '08... you remind us all the time!!!
2021-06-05 11:39:01,wallstreetbets,"No, the price does not ""mean diddly"". Yes, the market cap, by definition, would exceed not only GME but many other companies.  No, trying to artificially shoehorn market cap to any set number does not determine share price, which respond to both fundamentals AND supply & demand."
2021-06-05 11:08:11,wallstreetbets,Ok boomer
2021-06-05 15:07:50,wallstreetbets,"My exit at 60 is better than anything you’ll get, so sad for you."

2021-06-05 19:30:54,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't put too much stock in it, as it's extremely untrue. Look at the Monday after GME hit its ATH."
2021-06-05 14:35:17,wallstreetbets,"So the case can be argued that the biggest days seemed to be Wednesday and not friday, that in general, the max pain happens on Fridays."

He humble brags about it all the time.   Lol i actually work hard for my money.

But he is in banking, and follows stocks pretty closely, and is the only real life person i have that understands whats going on, or at least pretends to.

Haha i said he got me excited, and that he works for a bank, not that he is a genius, rich or super motivated.

😃"
2021-06-05 18:39:23,wallstreetbets,Yea I pay fees on my account ..... so no payment for order flow here .... my trades go to wherever they get best execution price... u can also switch your settings
2021-06-05 11:05:43,wallstreetbets,I was checking if i should listen to you based on your posting histories. But you are clearly a rat. Go fuck yourself
2021-06-05 11:06:16,wallstreetbets,"Disturbing, hedgefund trolls infiltrated us"
2021-06-05 12:05:29,wallstreetbets,Nobody wants your skeptic 🌈🐻 posts. We all know the risks so stop trying to act like you care if we lose money
2021-06-05 15:54:29,wallstreetbets,"I never said anything about GME, but I most certainly did invest in it. Bought in at 95 and sold at 260. Made tens of thousands of dollars in a few days."
2021-06-05 15:55:05,wallstreetbets,Cranky girl. Does someone need a diaper change?
2021-06-05 15:58:22,wallstreetbets,"Oh, well if your dad jumped in with his 400 dollars, then that changes everything."
2021-06-05 12:58:01,wallstreetbets,"You are trying to say that AMC has not reached the levels of GME because it’s price is well below the peak of GME. That’s just so stupidly wrong since AMC’s market cap was about the same at peak. I’m not shoehorning anything, you are comparing a arbitrary metric of two stocks. If what you were saying made any sense all the company would have to do to make the stock skyrocket would be to keep splitting the stock."
2021-06-05 19:34:15,wallstreetbets,I don't think you understand what market cap means. Is this the level of understanding of the average AMC shareholder? Good lord.
2021-06-05 15:36:41,wallstreetbets,"My average of 5$ a share speaks for itself, give your balls a tug m8"
2021-06-05 14:26:35,wallstreetbets,"Man thank you for that!  This is my first month aping around and ive dwpended on youtube videos and wsb for info to learn, and bow i know about investopedia!   Damn thats super helpful too.   Every time i learn something new feel like ill be that much more successful at this.  Not like i am now but maybe one day?

Thanks again!"
2021-06-05 14:50:06,wallstreetbets,Good info! Thanks
2021-06-05 19:32:35,wallstreetbets,"He's pretending. ""Going hyperbolic"" is a nonsense term that sprouted up during the first GME run and is a 100% sign that he started trading within the last 6 months."
2021-06-05 18:40:01,wallstreetbets,Thx bb
2021-06-05 12:36:01,wallstreetbets,I actually think this is just a regular guy afraid of losing money but he wants in. APE DONT THINK APE SWING
2021-06-05 15:52:48,wallstreetbets,Who said that I care? I think it's hilarious.
2021-06-05 19:45:52,wallstreetbets,No you did not. You know no shit at that time  you are nothing but a troll who wants people here to put their money in a stock where you already invested. Lol die trying
2021-06-05 19:41:12,wallstreetbets,You are the boomer who needs one. Get the fuck out of here.
2021-06-05 16:47:12,wallstreetbets,"wow you really are a BOT or an idiot who bought puts on AMC. Give it up we EAT through you losers. If you insist on knowing, my father has 400k in this. We arent all poor apes, we are One fighting for All.

Except you, Short/Put/Bagholder. We will rip you for every cent you own."
2021-06-05 15:52:30,wallstreetbets,That’s exactly what he’s doing.
2021-06-05 13:00:16,wallstreetbets,"No, that is NOT what I am saying.  What I said only countered the OPs direct point.  I have an entire post explaining why this is not done yet...this post is not it!  I am not comparing 2 arbitrary metrics at all."
2021-06-05 19:35:38,wallstreetbets,I fully understand what market cap means and the formula to calculate it...I cover it the first day of my classes.  But thank you for trying!
2021-06-05 15:57:24,wallstreetbets,Proof or ban.
2021-06-05 12:42:05,wallstreetbets,I hope you are right
2021-06-05 16:09:34,wallstreetbets,Gorillas don't swing. They're too big to brachiate. That's why they sleep on the ground.

2021-06-05 19:43:10,wallstreetbets,Uh ohhhhhh. Big girl made wet-wet during her nap.
2021-06-05 16:52:19,wallstreetbets,"You're an idiot and yes, I bought puts on AMC. They literally increased in value by thousands of dollars on both Thursday and Friday. I'm here to make money. You seem to be... enjoying other pursuits. Good luck with that."

2021-06-05 19:49:04,wallstreetbets,"Your history of comments exposed who you are, you didnt say anything good about AMC and you were never a part of the GME movement. Troll. Loser. Boomer. Sad. Thats who you are."
2021-06-05 17:53:51,wallstreetbets,Hope you cashed in on those out- only takes a gap up to tear you to shreds buddy. Good luck on your pursuit losing your entire investment.
2021-06-05 19:50:57,wallstreetbets,"It was never a ""movement,"" you moron. People are here to make money, I'm sorry you can't seem to rub two brain cells together to figure that out."
2021-06-05 18:53:38,wallstreetbets,"Mine are far out enough that a gap up, which ain't coming, jefe, won't really hurt. My puts went UP in value (granted, by like 0.5%, but still) when AMC shares jumped from 55 to 72 dollars in a few minutes."
2021-06-05 19:39:23,wallstreetbets,"I bought 1 put 1 year from now to hedge against 20 calls. They’re gonna squeeze you out the money- look at GME, 6 months strong idc how far out you bought them it’s only good for a slight hedge. You think GME will be less or or more 6 months from know?

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tableau Visualization for FTDs (Only first two weeks in May data so far) I went to the SEC website and downloaded just the data for the first half of May.  


Source: [SEC FTD DATA](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)  


I built this heatmap after beating my head against Tableau for a bit (updating the software, resetting passwords, remember how the hell to use it...)  


[HeatMap](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/steven.antonucci6887/viz/SECFTDs/FirstHalfMay2021)  


It is a work in progress, as it only has one piece of the data loaded and I filtered out all of the records that the sum of the failure is LESS THAN $50M.  If you are not familiar with a heat map, here's how to understand what you are looking at:  


The darker the blue, the more SHARES are involved.  


The larger the box, the more MONEY is involved.  


Obviously, the really big DOLLAR stuff is tied to index funds... but, have a look at who is BLUEST?  


I'm going outside for a bit, but feel free to ask questions and I'll see what I can do to extend this out to a longer timeline and add filters so you can ""query it""?"
2021-06-05 11:03:39,wallstreetbets,Good effort but more info in the post would be appreciated. AMC is dark blue for those who don't care to investigate.
2021-06-05 13:05:56,wallstreetbets,"There is another thing that I saw in the data:  


It represents 12,000 different ticker symbols, which was astonishing in it's own right...but I started looking at some of the companies and they were all pink sheet stocks worth nothing.  


Why would anyone FTD so many shares of stock worth nothing?  What are they doing in these pink sheet stocks?"
2021-06-05 12:47:03,wallstreetbets,"I didn't do that intentionally so that people would actually look at the data.  


Yes, AMC IS THE HIGHEST FTD by VOLUME for this time period..."

2021-06-05 19:27:08,wallstreetbets,"It's odd...  


There's something going on with a deli in NJ that somehow was given a ticker symbol and a $100M valuation, even though it's one guy and he makes $36K in sales per year.  


Oh, and tons of Chinese holding companies too...  


How do they launder things through these things...is the question?"
2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC Outperforming other stocks in terms of short seller pain FYI, AMC has had the most painful to short sellers since GME.  This is not to say that they covered GME, in fact many have not. 

Whoever tells you clov : $CLOV shorts are still up $3 million in mark-to-market profits for the month and up $90 million for the year. Even though they are down big over the last week, shorts won't cover in size (short squeeze) until they are deep in the red.



Whoever tells you bb:  you’ll notice the short interest has been to low, it would take months to have them cover.  Short sellers would need to be in the red for far too long before a squeeze can even be considered.


As of 17 hours ago .

$AMC short int is $4.53BN
88.20M shs shorted
17.65% SI% of Float
15.00% S3 SI% Float
9.05% fee
Shs shorted down -1.40M shares, worth $72M, -1.6%, last week.
Shorts down -$3.91BN in 2021 mark-to-market losses; up +$303M on today's -6.7% move. Shorts are down -$2.07BN for the week

All data As per : ihor dusaniwsky


You’ll notice AMC is the closest you’ll get to short positions closing. They can afford doing it with other stocks because they can drag it out. However with  AMC it’s been months already."
2021-06-05 12:43:25,wallstreetbets,Gme is still heavily shorted.  Post makes it sound like short sellers have stopped shorting but that’s not the case.  Just a reminder.  Amc and gme to the moon

Folks in the U.S. are fucking *starved* for a return to normality and nothing is more normie in American pop culture than going to the movies.  
Really the only problem is Hollywood's recent wave of shit-tier Oscar-bait films no one outside of Hollywood wants to see in the theater, so that may be why folks are shorting AMC.  
I also can't believe that shorters aren't quite getting the fact that WSB can stay retarded longer than hedge fund investors can remain confident."

This is personal for a lot of us and we don’t need to be dividing attention around several stocks. We need all hands on deck right now for AMC or the hedge funds will win. We have proven we can do this before with GME and we can do it again possibly even worse to hedge funds if we all band together for this.

2021-06-05 13:02:09,wallstreetbets,"I think the hedge funds are smarter than you think. They buy/sell calls and puts and make bank on the movement. They spend millions on advanced analytical software to spot trends in price, social media, etc, and react. They can pull bullshit in after hours trading too. I'm sure some are down heavy on AMC's movement but many are up big.

I read that only 11% of the huge AMC volume last week was retail trading. That should tell you something. I also read that around 30m shares shorted last week were returned dramatically dropping the short squeeze pressure. Those that are still in it can afford to hang on. And while it's one thing to diamond hand shares if you bought sub $12, it's another thing to risk holding shares buying above $40."

2021-06-05 11:53:02,wallstreetbets,CLOV is next. Nobody saying CLOV has squeezed yet. CLOV can be the most painful though
2021-06-05 12:26:22,wallstreetbets,Guys volume of AMC is like 500M. Shorts under 100M. You could have every short close and it wouldn’t matter. A short squeeze is when shorted shares is much larger than average volume. You can’t short squeeze with the current volume.

It's not about ""destroying shorts"" nor are these communities banding together to target them specifically. 

If there is any bit of that going on, it's a matter of exposing a criminal regime of naked short selling, bankrupting the economy and using the proceeds to do more nefarious things.

2021-06-05 17:18:44,wallstreetbets,I really hope you are right as I have put a bit of cash into AMC just so I could increase my position in GME with the profits
2021-06-05 15:54:12,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-05 19:58:23,wallstreetbets,This is exactly why I'm doing options with AMC and shares with GME
2021-06-05 19:10:10,wallstreetbets,"last 13F of Citadel show 724,599 shares and some put and calls but we don't know the strike price, the total float is 500M so even if they own some shares they own <0,2%.  
so they wanted to show that they are long on AMC, but can we trust those data? 

I think that they could create new share and report them as long even if they just self naked short them, isn't it? if they are able to create new naked short and don't report it, if they sell those stock to another company than buy it back to they can report it as long, right?

this is just my personal speculation, I could be wrong but for what I have understand since January, we can't trust any information provided and we have to ask why they want to show us something in their report"
2021-06-05 17:32:42,wallstreetbets,Real shit.
2021-06-05 18:52:02,wallstreetbets,"This is false, Citadel also has long positions in GME. Not as much but they still do"
2021-06-05 12:30:53,wallstreetbets,"next level FUD tactics: make BB look like FUD and distraction against AMC (which is a phenomenal short squeeze potential and I am balls deep invested) which however is also FUD/distraction or in more positive words; a little sidekick if you compare it to the GME play. Can't loose if you like both stocks. BB is great long-term but my god will people FOMO into AMC/GME soon and BB will crash when they move back to the original play(s).

2021-06-05 13:02:14,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I have more AMC than GME. I think the best shot is to focus on those two. Squeeze AMC then move to GME once out.
2021-06-05 13:12:04,wallstreetbets,Why would a smaller float mean it would squeeze harder? Wouldn’t a greater number of shares needing to be bought back equate to a higher number when we all hold?

2021-06-05 18:33:47,wallstreetbets,Agree.  Problem is everybody wants that free popcorn from AMC.  They didn't do any DD.  All you need to do is go on-line and SAY you are an investor in AMC to get the popcorn.  But you don't have to prove it.  muhhhahahahaa!
2021-06-05 12:47:16,wallstreetbets,"do some DD, thats only public shorts. If you haven't been paying attention all the freaking out about naked shorting is why AMC is so important.

2021-06-05 15:49:23,wallstreetbets,"A market crash in this scenario would be the consequence of hedge funds having to liquidate other long positions to cover their bleeding short positions. In this case the beta for shorted stocks would go super negative and they would rise while the rest of the market crashes. It's that act of covering that crashes everything else. (Note that GMEs beta has already been ludicrously negative for a while(-1.94) - it rises when the market falls and vice versa. This hints at how insanely unhinged it is from market fundamentals.)

Afterwards smart retail and surviving hedge funds tale the money made and roll it over into high value stocks that crashed with the market since all the good stuff is gonna he on sale."

I see big projects where I live like giant airport renovations where 3 people stand around for months and months. That money is going somewhere. It's paying someone. No work is getting done. Then, when a new political party takes over, they cancel that project or 'scale back' the scope, and instead build oil pipelines or Mexico-US Border walls. Point is, both sides are stealing and so little ever actually reaches those 'blue collar working people'."

2021-06-05 14:14:03,wallstreetbets,I'm hopeful I can parlay the AMC squeeze into the GME squeeze. But my complete amateurish opinion is they'll likely pop off almost simultaneously. I hope they get greedy enough to try and save one and not just abandon both tho...
2021-06-05 15:04:54,wallstreetbets,"What about after the squeeze with AMC, buy a shit load of BB shares since it’s so low.. blow that up and have some paper hands from the BB FOMO! Then buy back into GME"
2021-06-05 13:29:25,wallstreetbets,"I think what matters is how much short interest there is relative to the float, e.g. how many times do shorters need to buy the float to cover.

In that sense, a smaller float is one of many factors of importance."
2021-06-05 15:13:05,wallstreetbets,Gme has more shorting. Gme has a smaller amount of shares that should exist. Retail owns the available shares of gme multiple times over.where AMC just announced retail finally owns all the shares. Amc is not highly institutionally owned like gme.. it's like comparing apples and oranges.... The only thing in common is they both fall from a tree (being shorted). Plus ppl like citadel own a lott of shares and are long on amc... Ya know the guys that are naked shorting the entire market.... That sounds like future ammo preparations without having to actually naked short amc.

2021-06-05 14:07:58,wallstreetbets,It wouldn’t make since for retail to be holding 80% of the float if only 11% was traded by retail.. 🤔
2021-06-05 18:24:10,wallstreetbets,There are definitely a few weird things out there. For example I owned 200 AMC $1p Jan contracts I paid $0.09 for a few weeks ago. With their recent capital raise they are totally worthless since AMC has no chance of going bankrupt now. The stock will never drop to $1 by Jan so I figured no one would pay even $0.01 for them. But I was actually able to still sell them for $0.06 each even when AMC was sitting above $60. FTW? Someone must want something with those lol.
2021-06-05 13:07:18,wallstreetbets,"I like the stock, and bought some because I saw some DD and high SI on it, but can you ELI 5 what lower float is? I understand market cap :) CLOV to the moon 😎"

2021-06-05 16:32:51,wallstreetbets,Could say the same was with AMC a month ago...and remember what the headline says...when Melissa fucked up and she realized she fucked up.... “AMC”....come on.

2021-06-05 17:23:06,wallstreetbets,BB is a fine stock for a cybersecurity and EV play.  It might take a year or two to work out though.  It isn't really shorted that much though.  You might get a mini squeeze from people who don't want to risk holding it incase it spikes but after that it's bagholders all the way down.
2021-06-05 13:06:43,wallstreetbets,BB is a massive FUD campaign and people will loose shit tons of money unless they hold long-term. Now long-term holding means they can't move into AMC/GME without realizing losses or giving up on BB
2021-06-05 16:43:42,wallstreetbets,This needs to be spread more. GME/AMC are the plays. They’re kicking the can down the road.

2021-06-05 14:52:51,wallstreetbets,My retard understanding based on what sir\_wanksalot69 wrote is that there are Very Large insurance policies involved to pick up the tab and get those shares for the brokerage no matter the cost
2021-06-05 16:33:52,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, that’s good information."
2021-06-05 19:49:55,wallstreetbets,Yuuuup. If the squeeze hits and i make bank i am buying the sp500 dip and rolling it all into a boring ass index like vtsax for at least a year.
2021-06-05 18:20:58,wallstreetbets,Interesting
2021-06-05 16:19:18,wallstreetbets,My tits are jacked.
2021-06-05 16:27:52,wallstreetbets,"I own both, although I own much more AMC."
2021-06-05 15:06:24,wallstreetbets,All I’m saying is focus on the 2 companies that are doing damage to hedgefunds right now to tip everything into the common persons favor. After those 2 then the market is going to look very very different.
2021-06-05 14:11:41,wallstreetbets,"But having to buy the entire float *beyond* 100% is irrelevant. It doesn’t matter how many times they have to buy the float, anything more than *all of it* is superfluous. Could be 2X, could be 1000X of the float. As long as people hold their shares it doesn’t matter. Unless you’re just saying having to buy the float multiple times = having to buy more shares. In which case, I agree as it would seem to agree with my point that more shares needing to be bough = greater magnitude of squeeze, not smaller float."
2021-06-05 15:34:48,wallstreetbets,"It’s not exactly apples and oranges if they fall from the same tree is it? More like comparing golden crisp and Granny Smith. Having an allegiance to a stock is stupid IMO. We’re all here to make money. Personally, amc has a *mich more attractive* price point. And if we’re in agreement that they will both squeeze , seems like the logical choice is to make the percentage gains play versus the current Dick measuring contest happening between the 2 factions. If I invest $1000 in each, the distance to double for each is different. I will double my money as soon as amc hits $90. While you’ll need GME to hit $500. Outcome is the same right? 2X my money, however, the distance to the goal is *far* shorter on amc. I hold both, so don’t think I’m just fanboying, it’s just math."
2021-06-05 18:44:31,wallstreetbets,Knock knock

2021-06-05 11:28:10,wallstreetbets,Paper hand. Do some dd.
2021-06-05 11:27:06,wallstreetbets,I never thought it would hit $50 but positioned my options for a possible spike over $50. That happened and happened in a hurry. And those options I picked up a couple weeks prior printed huge last week. So never say never.
2021-06-05 16:56:20,wallstreetbets,Always worked in the companies favour... but retailers being up  over 1000% is nice isn’t it ?
2021-06-05 19:18:52,wallstreetbets,Do you have anything specific though? It's really hard to either correct the issue or explain it if I can't get any examples =/
2021-06-05 17:33:05,wallstreetbets,"Highly upvoted and awarded posts these times are sadly following the same pattern: ""random ticker - rocket  - to thaa moon - rocket and moon emoji"".

2021-06-05 16:52:57,wallstreetbets,Add in the extra 25 million they want sell
2021-06-05 14:55:00,wallstreetbets,With only 26 million gme available for the public to buy
2021-06-05 18:23:45,wallstreetbets,Yes. Welcome to the stock market.
2021-06-05 14:34:16,wallstreetbets,"I think both can be true. There are around 500 million shares right? At any given time around 400 million are owned by retail traders since many institutional investors like Wanda and Mudrick have closed their positions.

Meanwhile daily volume has been maybe 400m average, so around 44m daily from retail who tend to buy/hold, or maybe trade once or twice a day individually. And the rest from pros and market makers who are trading several times per hour."
2021-06-05 15:09:09,wallstreetbets,"Float is the actual amount of stock that can be traded. CLOV has around 145M and 35M of those shares are on the hand of insiders. Some of those award to insiders, can’t even be traded until certain conditions are met. That leaves the float with 110M shares and a market cap of roughly 1B$. That is way less that AMC or GME and higher SI than them. All together make CLOV very susceptible to our “ape” action"
2021-06-05 13:30:24,wallstreetbets,"I don't care if you work in the industry. Its public knowledge that failing to deliver on your shorts is illegal in the [SEC regulations](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.html) after 2008. AMC has super high fail to delivers and retail owns over 80% of the stock. Its also illegal to use shorts to manipulate stock price. 

I don't need your mental gymnastics trying to explain away blatant manipulation of a stock to bankrupt it."
2021-06-05 14:00:53,wallstreetbets,"Completely agreed, people should buy into investments that net 0.00001% return per year instead of buying a 2$ stock and selling it for 400$ or buying a 30$ call and selling it at 500$ like I did. Invest in some dumb bubble ETF my man"
2021-06-05 15:18:16,wallstreetbets,Finally someone with sense. It’s insane how conspiratorial meme stocks have become.
2021-06-05 19:38:03,wallstreetbets,Theyre long AMC.
2021-06-05 17:43:17,wallstreetbets,Because they are hedged on AMC because they hold shares?
2021-06-05 17:59:04,wallstreetbets,Can you provide a link to this video. I took a internet break and now i keep hearing it talked about.
2021-06-05 16:18:30,wallstreetbets,There’s some good DD that suggests they are using AMC to hedge GME going up. AMC/GME were >80% correlated last week.
2021-06-05 17:33:28,wallstreetbets,Agreed but and there is a lot of long term plays like CLNE and SENS but a lot of the discussion in the thread is about bleeding out hedgefunds and getting 10x your investment in the near future. BB has nothing to do with that and is mainly being used to get people out of AMC and GME.
2021-06-05 17:04:10,wallstreetbets,How long is “long term”? I bought AMC in January and am dabbling in BB now.
2021-06-05 14:18:14,wallstreetbets,What is fud
2021-06-05 16:56:38,wallstreetbets,So BB is not real and we have been f$&@ked
2021-06-05 15:35:13,wallstreetbets,And they always seem to have a great ass
2021-06-05 12:50:02,wallstreetbets,Low standards and easy plays. 😎
2021-06-05 14:36:05,wallstreetbets,So we loose either way?
2021-06-05 16:02:05,wallstreetbets,Agree 100% GME and AMC have already put hedge funds on their heels. Blackberry has done nothing yet. Let’s focus on the stocks that they fear the most right now and then down the road BB can be an option too. We have to stay together on this. Making them feel the pain is the ultimate goal.
2021-06-05 15:07:51,wallstreetbets,Interesting!  Exciting times for the common folks to make some decent money.  Let’s go!!! 💎
2021-06-05 14:45:03,wallstreetbets,But a smaller float is better if people paper hand.
2021-06-05 15:06:51,wallstreetbets,"Squeeze size depends on how fast enough people paperhands to kill the momentum.

Best outcome is with the float needing to be bought multiple times over, not just once."
2021-06-05 15:56:38,wallstreetbets,The only thing really in favor of AMC is the price is still cheap enough to actually execute calls when ITM. Smaller float is much better since it takes less people to own all the float. And multiple times over means higher squeeze since all shorts need to be closed. But everyone what they like. Both will make money.
2021-06-05 15:36:30,wallstreetbets,They fall from A tree .. not the same tree. That was the whole point... Which means they have nothing in common except that they're both shorted.
2021-06-05 12:22:44,wallstreetbets,You need to go over to /r/investing and load up on some etf's with your shortsighted mentality.

2021-06-05 18:15:15,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
2021-06-05 19:40:08,wallstreetbets,And they couldn’t buy GME shares?…
2021-06-05 18:10:14,wallstreetbets,https://twitter.com/cash_hendrixxx/status/1400924536753827841?s=21
2021-06-05 19:44:02,wallstreetbets,"Talking 5 years. BB was a trend in this sub like a year ago, its not going to ever squeeze, but is a good long term buy"
2021-06-05 14:26:15,wallstreetbets,Fear uncertainty doubt
2021-06-05 14:38:16,wallstreetbets,Fear uncertainty doubt
2021-06-05 17:09:44,wallstreetbets,"Bb and anything other than AMC and GME are all p&d schemes to distract from the real show. Unfortunately not enough people are doing their own Dd, or even reading the DD being posted here or the other subreddit and are going to lose big."
2021-06-05 14:50:17,wallstreetbets,No we win either way
2021-06-05 15:57:02,wallstreetbets,"Exchange has the right to delist a stock if the Exchange believes the stock is too illiquid/manipulated/etc and detaches too much from the original purpose of traditional investing.

So yes, people can 'lose' even if they are right. Plus, we saw Jan squeeze. There's nothing to stop brokerages from preventing further buys. Then we get brokerages like EToro that automatically sold people's shares 'by glitch/mistake'.

No repercussions."
2021-06-05 16:37:14,wallstreetbets,"If the squeeze happens, we win until we don't. The price could go well into the thousands before something gives, but everyone posting ""10k is not a meme!"" or ""I'm not selling until $42000!"" are being delusional."
2021-06-05 15:26:36,wallstreetbets,But that still just boils down to volume.
2021-06-05 16:43:12,wallstreetbets,So are you saying AMC *will not* squeeze or that the share price will not go as high?
2021-06-05 12:24:01,wallstreetbets,Don't worry about me.  I'm doing just fine.
2021-06-05 13:08:02,wallstreetbets,Who cares. It doesn't affect me printing profits on this trade lol.  Hater born everyday.  I let them do what they do best.  I print instead.
2021-06-05 17:27:31,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget who they sold the stock too either..
2021-06-05 13:45:20,wallstreetbets,"I bought AMC at $3.50, good luck with that."
2021-06-05 14:25:10,wallstreetbets,Mods check this guy out and see if he’s really in the industry and if not ban this MF
2021-06-05 17:12:44,wallstreetbets,Omg 😱 what should I do I’ve been holding the freaking bag
2021-06-05 14:52:53,wallstreetbets,That’s good
2021-06-05 19:47:57,wallstreetbets,"This is the thing nobody is considering, the powers that be including the government will never let the price get astronomical. Im holding gme but i will be paying attention to what the sec and white house says when shit starts to get crazy."
2021-06-05 16:12:01,wallstreetbets,"If there's 10x the volume of stock but it sells at a tenth of the price, then people buy 10x as much per paycheck, and sell 10x as much when they paperhands.

Absolute volume is not really important in stocks. You have to think about ratios.

A 1m shorts is easier to cover over a 100m float than over a 10m float because you need 1% of the former to paperhands, and 10% of the latter. Ratios are important."
2021-06-05 18:25:12,wallstreetbets,Won't be anywhere near as high. But it will still squeeze if ppl actually hold all their shares.
2021-06-05 13:23:33,wallstreetbets,Yeh this guy probably puts on pants during investor calls
2021-06-05 12:25:06,wallstreetbets,"Not worried, it's theoretically possible that these shares will reach 1000+."
2021-06-05 17:53:42,wallstreetbets,This is my thoughts
2021-06-05 17:55:28,wallstreetbets,"Yep, done on purpose to cover shorts"
2021-06-05 14:00:10,wallstreetbets,"Dudes whole history is just shitting on GME and AMC.  
Seems sus to me."
2021-06-05 17:35:14,wallstreetbets,I’ll never give financial advise since i am not qualified to do so.. but there are two stocks i happen to like that are highly talked about.
2021-06-05 18:34:36,wallstreetbets,"That’s my point. They *both* will squeeze. This isn’t a dick measuring contest. I don’t care which one goes higher, if that’s even something you can quantify. 

Simple math:

Just for the sake of easy, round numbers, let’s say my goal is to reach $1million and I only have $1000. It’s not, but like I said, round numbers. 

$1000 = 4 shares of GME or 21 shares of AMC. In order to reach 1 million, GME needs to hit a minimum of $250k. Meanwhile AMC would only need to hit $47.6k. So while it still needs to be proven that the “magnitude” of the squeeze on GME will be greater, if my only goal is to make $1million my road to that victory is achieved far earlier with amc. It’s just math. It’s a percentage gains game. 

Like I said, I hold both. I hope GME goes to $36 million per share or whatever stupid fucking number it is now, because *it needs to* as many of the new apes holding GME are only holding X or *maybe* XX shares. That life changing money is absolutely *depending* on it. Meanwhile, even *if* AMC only squeezes one sixth of the amount of GME, I will have reached the same goal. More shares X 1/6th scale GME squeeze = life changing money."
2021-06-05 12:26:35,wallstreetbets,"Like I keep saying, but nobody actually reads, I'm all for it.  I own calls for rest of this month and into next month.  If it runs to $1000 I will be printing all day.  Just trying to be realistic.  Either way I'll be fine, $100 or $1000+"
2021-06-05 12:33:02,wallstreetbets,"GME was 140% of float shorted and hit $480 for 1 day intraday.  That was it.  AMC is not in that same position.  I started printing once it hit over $40 on my calls.  If it heads as high as you say, I'll be retiring end of June.  But I'll gladly take $100/share as well.  I can retire with that number also."
2021-06-05 14:01:45,wallstreetbets,probably someone paid to talk shit. or they got burned in options and are mad.
2021-06-05 13:37:46,wallstreetbets,"I don't beleive the 100k a share thing either, but your GME argument is really bad and implies there was no exchange manipulation preventing it from exceeding 480"
2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,First options trade ever..do I cash out at the open or wait ? 
2021-06-05 10:37:46,wallstreetbets,That depends on your strategy. Do you want to take profits or do you want to learn an expensive lesson you won't forget?
2021-06-05 11:25:53,wallstreetbets,"2000% UP , and OP is in doubt whether to cash out 🤦‍♂️"

2021-06-05 10:55:22,wallstreetbets,"I has cash.  
Want try options.
….
Profit?!?

Wtf is margin call again?"
2021-06-05 19:40:30,wallstreetbets,"No plan, only YOLOs. Give the man a box of crayons and let him choose his favorite color."
2021-06-05 11:05:11,wallstreetbets,Interactive brokers gives you full access to us options market.
2021-06-05 11:46:34,wallstreetbets,"Hes better off rerolling to a different expiration, theta is gonna eat those up if it drops"
2021-06-05 11:47:29,wallstreetbets,"You realize these are call options and not stocks, and will lose extrinsic value as they get closer to the expiration date, right?"
2021-06-05 18:39:51,wallstreetbets,What is this supposed to shit
2021-06-05 18:31:45,wallstreetbets,"Well if the price goes up, it's not going to matter too much."
2021-06-05 11:53:44,wallstreetbets,Some of us retards have to relearn it multiple times
2021-06-05 14:38:37,wallstreetbets,I was up $45K and held til I was down $6K ...... :)
2021-06-05 17:51:30,wallstreetbets,"If it’s good enough for a screenshot, it’s good enough to sell"
2021-06-05 19:35:51,wallstreetbets,Uhhhh
2021-06-05 15:02:35,wallstreetbets,Can u explain the decay to me? I understand that delta is the appreciation of the option and gamma is basically the average of delta and theta but what is the ideal time to buy or sell the option? When the theta is low and delta high? And if the theta is negative i.e -.01 is that generally good?
2021-06-05 13:31:59,wallstreetbets,"lol you used greeks, apes dont speak greek"
2021-06-05 16:50:54,wallstreetbets,"You don’t want none this shit, Dewey."
2021-06-05 17:21:12,wallstreetbets,"Have you ever made a 2000% return...?



...I didn't think so."
2021-06-05 10:57:03,wallstreetbets,Thats when your doctor wants you to stop using butter..
2021-06-05 11:11:48,wallstreetbets,"Awesome! Thnks. Got more info for me that could be of use? Any good tutorials on options? Still have some trouble understanding the 'greeks' 

Was thinking of blowing a set amount just to have an experience with options, see how it feels."
2021-06-05 11:58:24,wallstreetbets,Could do that as well. I personally take some profit off the table if the trade is making money. Otherwise all you have is paper profit that's here today and gone tomorrow. I like locking in some gains.
2021-06-05 11:57:20,wallstreetbets,Not sure you understood the point to begin with. If he is printing he can sell half his positions. In this case options. And let the other half run. If they print more great. If they expire worthless so be it.
2021-06-05 12:29:28,wallstreetbets,True that
2021-06-05 15:34:53,wallstreetbets,"I have a hard time learing from my mistakes.

2021-06-05 17:06:47,wallstreetbets,I learn it once a week
2021-06-05 17:18:06,wallstreetbets,I was up 120k and held till I was down 30k. Probably do it again 🥜
2021-06-05 19:18:03,wallstreetbets,You did not correctly define any of the Greeks mentioned. Do some research on this because they are important.
2021-06-05 18:24:21,wallstreetbets,"The closer you get to expiration, the more decay. Doesn't decay as fast until last month, then substantially every day. Last week is extreme. Definitely want to close by Wednesday (I would've on Friday). Only exception is if you think Delta is going to offset theta decay"
2021-06-05 15:03:05,wallstreetbets,"Oh, they'll be speaking plenty of Greek eventually."
2021-06-05 11:25:40,wallstreetbets,That's a margarine call. This is where you call a girl named margin and she comes over to touch your butt in a hottub
2021-06-05 11:13:40,wallstreetbets,"I can give you this: interactive brokers is a whole new level of trading. The interface is not build for beginners. Its expert shit. You have to understand all mechanisems because otherwise the tool is hard to use. 

Regarding options:
Look into youtube. I dont understand greeks either."
2021-06-05 11:49:59,wallstreetbets,Don't overwhelm yourself with all the Greeks. You only need to know Delta and Theta.
2021-06-05 13:05:49,wallstreetbets,Why give up profits though if you don’t have to? I mean how much greedier can you get ? Up 2000% just take the trade off the table and open a new one with more capital if you feel that much conviction in your play.
2021-06-05 19:45:47,wallstreetbets,I lol'ed a bit when I read this and was like ...why is he making more money than me haha
2021-06-05 17:07:40,wallstreetbets,That sounds nice.  Gonna need a few million for a chick that hot and crazy to be into both me and that.  Butter or margarine optional.
2021-06-05 11:15:49,wallstreetbets,Thanks anyway. Never hurts to browse around the interface. Not going full blown retard on this. Dip my toe in.
2021-06-05 14:15:50,wallstreetbets,"Any websites I can read up? Incould ask google but then have to work my way through a shitload of useless info.

Thnx for the reply"
2021-06-05 13:06:55,wallstreetbets,A bird in the hand is better than 2 in the bush.
2021-06-05 13:10:27,wallstreetbets,"By all means research every last thing you can about option strategies and the Greeks. Don’t listen to anyone who says otherwise. It’s better to be prepared and not surprised. Options trading is more similar to gambling , you make a load of money very quickly and u can lose it all immediately as well. It’s all about gambling in your favor , do the research and always stick your plan , never stray from it and for the love of god don’t let emotions run your trades !"
2021-06-05 18:27:55,wallstreetbets,It's all on YouTube. And inestopedia.com
2021-06-05 14:17:20,wallstreetbets,Thnx! Got any good solid videos or websites I could add to my list of reading?
2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"(Part 3) AMC & GME Price Action Comparison before their squeeze What's going on y'all?

This time around I wanted to solely focus on numbers and no charts. Below are the links to my previous posts.

You be the judge of what's going to happen next week"
2021-06-05 11:19:14,wallstreetbets,"There was a GME DD that showed great technical analysis of both the T+21 days and the T+31 days and how they overlap for GME for 6/9 and based on the inversion of the squiggly lines on the bottom of the technical chart, every time they cross we can expect massive volatility. As a result, based on the math that this guy over at GME did, he is expecting a squeeze to begin on 6/9 give or take a day or two. Now this also means that ALL other meme stocks have the potential to go tits up also, as one usually follows with the other. 

Based upon your technical analysis, can you link any T+21 data or perhapes even the Fibbonaci/Elliot waves theorem to this coming week? It does seem sus that an unusual number of corporate interest picked up last week going into this week, and that being said, if GME does hit that 6/9 spike, it could be the trigger for AMC too. 

Your thoughts?"
2021-06-05 10:13:15,wallstreetbets,So what’s going to happen?
2021-06-05 10:08:52,wallstreetbets,"They’re trying hard to stop the GME style repeat of AMC, don’t believe a f’ing word you hear from the media cucks-we’re at a threshold moment, retards."
2021-06-05 10:43:48,wallstreetbets,"Holding AMC, not deterred even in the least and still up 119% :)"
2021-06-05 15:17:22,wallstreetbets,I have my down payment for my house(60k) accidentally on game amc n naked. Because I didn’t even notice I have been withdrawing money out from my account at the beginning when I saw the dips. N every time my wife tells me to take it out n all I can tell her is next week. So to all the paper hands do yourself a favor just hold.
2021-06-05 10:11:32,wallstreetbets,"If we follow the trend it looks like it should blow up on Monday, especially after what happened yesterday"
2021-06-05 10:13:43,wallstreetbets,Squeeze me daddy
2021-06-05 10:42:15,wallstreetbets,Lotsa of fuds in here! Wsbs is becoming a boiler room chat. SEC is asleep at the wheel again!

2021-06-05 17:06:27,wallstreetbets,"as shit is going, it does look like amc will before any short squeeze go to where GME is

once there i think both will take off and drag any and all meme stocks with them,"
2021-06-05 11:05:28,wallstreetbets,/tboneperri spreading FUD
2021-06-05 10:04:44,wallstreetbets,That AMC volume is insane compared to GMEs back in January
2021-06-05 11:47:25,wallstreetbets,When will these millennials gen Z kids whatever you call them stop standing up and stop this corruption that's going on in the stock market not just manipulation but full-blown corruption.. make sure you pay for your scholarship while these celebrities pay the back door and get away with it
2021-06-05 11:38:35,wallstreetbets,AMC needs our help this coming week more than ever.  Keep our positive momentum going.
2021-06-05 19:03:36,wallstreetbets,"GME closed higher every single day and reached higher highs. The first time it closed lower, it followed that path downwards till it hit 40. AMC has been downtrending for 2 days already since its peak, so I'm not in rn. But I really fucking hope it does go nuts and you guys all get rich. Godspeed retards"
2021-06-05 10:20:36,wallstreetbets,A lot of new apes probably sold because of the dip
2021-06-05 12:04:28,wallstreetbets,GME itself is proof of concept. Why wouldn't AMC hit a minimum of $200 - 300.  It's a smooth brainer.
2021-06-05 12:12:16,wallstreetbets,But look at the HUGE volume difference. How much does that play into thing considering what looks like AMC is far More saturated with shares (smooth brain 🧠 oo oo ah ah 🦍🦧
2021-06-05 10:52:09,wallstreetbets,So if i get this right we're gonna like double in price on monday/ tuesday.
2021-06-05 10:46:02,wallstreetbets,"AMC right now has the same market cap as GME during that mooning period (GME has different growth prospects too). And you think AMC is gonna double or triple to $50-$70bn? What companies are worth that much? That’s like putting PTON and PLTR together + you can add CNK as the cherry on top. But who knows anymore - nothing makes sense. 

Look at ratios for GME vs. peers during that moon and AMC vs. peers right now. Look at P/E, EV/EBITDA, whatever metric that has market cap included then compare at which point was the peak."
2021-06-05 14:17:32,wallstreetbets,You’re a genius man! Love this chart! Holding my 1000 AMC shares 💎🙌🚀
2021-06-05 10:20:16,wallstreetbets,So we're ignoring the part where GME hit a peak of 35 billion market cap and then a week later had a market cap of 4 billion? Ok.
2021-06-05 14:53:27,wallstreetbets,I hope AMC follows that track and more!

2021-06-05 10:37:32,wallstreetbets,Can you add #BBBY to this for comparison
2021-06-05 17:49:22,wallstreetbets,"Yep. It’s by u/Criand

He has been tracking this stuff very well.

I recommend people read his stuff"
2021-06-05 13:41:44,wallstreetbets,I fucking love this got about halfway through and was like wait a minute
2021-06-05 11:00:18,wallstreetbets,You be the judge he said
2021-06-05 10:18:24,wallstreetbets,Look at what GME did between January 28th and February 4th. That's what's gonna happen. Monday is gonna be AMC's February 2nd.
2021-06-05 10:51:47,wallstreetbets,Yes sir
2021-06-05 13:13:39,wallstreetbets,Up 480%. Not deterred. I'll hold. Also I own 3 shares so IDAF. They call me diamond hands.
2021-06-05 10:47:13,wallstreetbets,"Smart, looks like you got in somewhat earlier than most. Make sure you have an exit strategy."
2021-06-05 10:13:47,wallstreetbets,What happened yesterday? There was different pieces of news around
2021-06-05 17:50:35,wallstreetbets,uwu
2021-06-05 10:55:36,wallstreetbets,Ignore it. I dont even understand why they are here other than to scare people
2021-06-05 11:32:22,wallstreetbets,"I have nothing in AMC but a little profit in BB, should I get out on Monday or hold ?"
2021-06-05 14:38:02,wallstreetbets,He's just trying desperately to not lose his ass on his puts lol
2021-06-05 11:15:00,wallstreetbets,"Shitposter, for some reason he has been pulling AMC down since he joined Reddit. Very sus"
2021-06-05 18:32:20,wallstreetbets,I'm really hope he makes a LOSS post for those puts.
2021-06-05 10:33:47,wallstreetbets,Because GME has 10 times less shares
2021-06-05 19:15:14,wallstreetbets,Some people got lives to live lol
2021-06-05 10:30:01,wallstreetbets,My question is: will this go down some more? And when will we see the squeeze?
2021-06-05 14:58:28,wallstreetbets,Because it would need hundreds of billions in market cap to do that. amc is already 80% owned by retail traders. How much more liquidity do you think people have to throw at it?
2021-06-05 15:36:26,wallstreetbets,It’s exactly why a short squeeze cannot happen the way people imagine on this sub. Don’t fall for it. Think about it.
2021-06-05 11:01:21,wallstreetbets,Your problem is that fundamentals are not relevant in a short squeeze scenario.
2021-06-05 10:43:25,wallstreetbets,Lol we all know that
2021-06-05 10:36:46,wallstreetbets,So don't ignore it. Tell us what it means.
2021-06-05 10:47:37,wallstreetbets,This ^. I think real apes 🦍 are smarter than most folks here. It is actually disingenuous to call themselves apes.
2021-06-05 10:54:36,wallstreetbets,You sound like an analyst from CNBC 🤣🤣🤣🤣

2021-06-05 13:08:22,wallstreetbets,Do i have to wear the dress?
2021-06-05 10:25:57,wallstreetbets,I hope the Naked Short Selling slip from Melissa Lee will make retail investors angry and double down in their positions.i have 5k waiting to use to buy more shares.
2021-06-05 11:12:51,wallstreetbets,Go rate pizza with your paper handed buddy
2021-06-05 12:32:47,wallstreetbets,you must be joking 😂
2021-06-05 16:49:50,wallstreetbets,so when you say it's gonna be like Feb 2nd. it's going down?
2021-06-05 13:35:25,wallstreetbets,All the retards “agreeing” with you and doubling down when January 28 was the first peak and February 4 was the last day of hemorrhaging.
2021-06-05 11:22:52,wallstreetbets,Are you saying that we likely saw the peak of AMC pricing?
2021-06-05 12:24:00,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-05 18:29:58,wallstreetbets,How are your AMC puts doing?
2021-06-05 13:14:49,wallstreetbets,Exit for what loool

This whole deal, getting people all riled up"
2021-06-05 17:51:50,wallstreetbets,"Because it works against the weak minded.

Damn shame too, since WSB was known for its retard strength. People would hold bags through the most hilariously dumb shit just for karma and sometimes it would pay off big!

Hell, DFV was “bagholding” for a long time until he wasn’t"
2021-06-05 12:25:34,wallstreetbets,AMC is the way. I see 70+ Monday
2021-06-05 18:36:46,wallstreetbets,"I doubt he will, he’s a narc"
2021-06-05 10:41:17,wallstreetbets,"Theee are more retail investors now compared back then. But GME is the OG, all of these is happening now because GME showed us it can be done."
2021-06-05 10:35:38,wallstreetbets,I hope it goes down more...I'm ready to buy more
2021-06-05 10:46:35,wallstreetbets,"You saw the squeeze on Wednesday. It was when a stock realistically worth $3/share had 30 billion dollars injected into it practically overnight and was trading at double its ATH. Below 25 EOW, below 10 EOM."
2021-06-05 15:35:19,wallstreetbets,"Excellent point, AMC has ~450 million shares while GME has ~70 million. Amc's peak of 72 is almost exactly equivalent to GME's peak of 450."
2021-06-05 17:04:51,wallstreetbets,The idea/hope is that non-retail traders will be forced to throw some liquidity.
2021-06-05 15:35:01,wallstreetbets,This. People have no concept or understanding of this. AMC already dwarfs GMEs peak cap.
2021-06-05 11:20:32,wallstreetbets,"I agree, and price movement can't be discounted. But rather than just looking at the percentage change in price, look at the relative changes. My Capital IQ isn't working right now, but I will take a look at the peak ratios for GME relative to its peers and compare that with the current ratios for AMC relative to its peers. I'd say this is more technical than fundamental analysis although I'm using 'fundamental' ratios.

Also look at how long the squeeze lasted for GME. It was 1-2 weeks long. So maybe we see AMC go up to $80 or $100 but then you can buy puts because it won't hang around there for more than a week, let alone a month or two.

I'm not against AMC mooning, but I'm also not against AMC tanking. Best way is to play both sides because institutions are doing just that."
2021-06-05 10:44:12,wallstreetbets,Then you're dumb if you're still holding.
2021-06-05 10:38:37,wallstreetbets,"I mean, the math isn't hard. It means that AMC peaked at a similar market cap on Wednesday, which translated to roughly $73/share, and if it continues to bleed just like GME bled after hitting its own peak, you'll see AMC below $10 at some point next week. That's what that would mean. I'm not predicting a specific price, but AMC has a lot of drilling left to do."
2021-06-05 10:56:16,wallstreetbets,I sound like someone who's telling you some truth that you don't want to hear.
2021-06-05 18:24:03,wallstreetbets,It's a semi-formal squeeze.
2021-06-05 11:07:14,wallstreetbets,I definitely doubling down on both amc and gme . I already had big hopes in both squeezes. Now it’s just out of spite for what happened on to. Diamond hands 🙌🏼💎
2021-06-05 18:24:48,wallstreetbets,So buy 1 more of each. Got it. Big money here.
2021-06-05 10:45:29,wallstreetbets,"If you are in , I am in too but unfortunately you need to put in 50k. 5k from all of us may move GME but we all in to chip in 50k come Monday ok ape? Let’s go 🦧!!"

Yeah, there's your problem right there. You're trading on hope and desire and delusion, not reason."

2021-06-05 15:33:21,wallstreetbets,Yes. Look at the market cap. Don’t fall for this.
2021-06-05 15:54:00,wallstreetbets,1000%.
2021-06-05 18:52:33,wallstreetbets,"Excellently, actually. Blood red in the first half of the week, then fairly flat Wednesday, and the past two days my portfolio has been quite green. They turned the corner at 10 AM Thursday and never stopped printing."
2021-06-05 10:42:37,wallstreetbets,That was awesome🤣🤣🤣
2021-06-05 19:38:38,wallstreetbets,Exactly!!! We are the anti-Wallstreet thesis thats why squeezing of GME worked back in January.
2021-06-05 19:32:17,wallstreetbets,And here I thought Mr. Magoo was just a movie.
2021-06-05 12:09:40,wallstreetbets,GME hasn’t shown us anything yet. Get ready for the shareholder meeting next week.
2021-06-05 10:49:26,wallstreetbets,Who said the GME squeeze was over?
2021-06-05 10:36:40,wallstreetbets,So am I. I bought the dip.
2021-06-05 11:01:54,wallstreetbets,A short squeeze requires shorts to cover their positions.
2021-06-05 10:52:46,wallstreetbets,Wrong. Hahahaha
2021-06-05 11:39:52,wallstreetbets,i hope to god you're trolling or else you're actually mentally challenged
2021-06-05 15:46:01,wallstreetbets,Precisely.
2021-06-05 15:46:32,wallstreetbets,"Also, remember after gamestop peaked and then dropped to around $50 for a couple weeks? Yeah."
2021-06-05 15:47:59,wallstreetbets,*$50k i meant.
2021-06-05 15:47:43,wallstreetbets,"Thats when i bought in to gamestop, held for the couple weeks and then made $50 on my contracts when it spiked over $100. 
The technical data is not nearly the same with amc though, and these traders that don’t know any better are going to be hurting."
2021-06-05 17:23:08,wallstreetbets,"Thats the whole point. AMC is not remotely setup the same as something like gme was. $72 was the squeeze, and all the rest of the shorts doubled down."
2021-06-05 17:21:46,wallstreetbets,But the reality is that most of them are either selling very large quantities or adding to their short positions and averaging down from the spike so they can profit big on the coming crash.
2021-06-05 15:45:29,wallstreetbets,They’ll figure it out in the next week or two when we’re looking at a price in the 20s.
2021-06-05 11:23:10,wallstreetbets,"But the GME movement back in January was moreso a gamma squeeze and was artificially and prematurely cutoff in duration when Robbinghood and other brokers shut off the buy button. So unless that happens again with AMC, it is hard to compare the two situations."
2021-06-05 12:01:51,wallstreetbets,"I agree with your rational way of thinking. Some apes in stocktwits think I was spreading FUD just because I want them to realize their profits. IMO the chances of it taking a big dump next week are higher than a squeeze unless a whale steps in to reverse the momentum. 

Retail pushed the market cap 7B higher than GME at both of their ATH's but that's probably because ape see lower price, if just one whale dumps the market fear skyrockets, exactly how GME previously played out.

With that being said I'm probably gonna get a lot of shit for this but, positions:

10x AMC $20 puts exp. Friday

For the sake of everyone else on this sub, I hope I don't print."
2021-06-05 12:43:13,wallstreetbets,"Good perspective on the relative, but how would you play both sides? Puts to offset current shares? I'm kind of a noob."
2021-06-05 10:45:41,wallstreetbets,The squeeze hasnt started yet. And its my money so you dumb for getting involve with it
2021-06-05 10:40:01,wallstreetbets,"Ok, thanks for the explanation."

2021-06-05 10:47:18,wallstreetbets,I had positions in GME earlier but i moved all of them when AMC gone nuts. Bought them when they were 13 now i am up almost 400 percent.  Whats is the mark for GME to squeeze? Does anyone know?
2021-06-05 10:38:12,wallstreetbets,"Idk bro... I didn’t even think it was that big a deal because I figured they were doing it and everyone just assumed that as well.

The reaction I’ve seen so far has been way over the top of Apes shaking the bars of their cage in some feeding frenzy.  GME and AMC peeps are going mental.  

People know the shorts haven’t fully covered and now they smell blood.  

Spicey."

2021-06-05 15:53:43,wallstreetbets,"Good luck with that. AMC to 200, makes total sense. The top **definitely** isn't already in."
2021-06-05 15:54:45,wallstreetbets,"The amount of comments that just go off share price alone is ridiculous. When people scream Hold, it’s time to sell."
2021-06-05 11:48:16,wallstreetbets,"Fair point, then maybe apply some premium to get to AMC's peak. On the other hand, GME also had more hype and activism with Cohen. So it could be offsetting. Anyhow this analysis could be futile, but there is a point where it can't go higher and if you can find that point then needless to say $$$"
2021-06-05 15:49:05,wallstreetbets,"Idk about short term volatility, but in long term I think most people would agree that stock price could easily be below $10. 

Might be worth buying puts in long term rather than weeklies if you can afford it. Or do short risk reversal where you sell a call and buy a put."
2021-06-05 17:16:15,wallstreetbets,"wait till amc falls back down, then sell puts against it cause the implied vol will still be super high"
2021-06-05 15:45:51,wallstreetbets,"If you own shares then sell calls. If you don’t then sell puts. It’s better to sell calls on green days and sell puts on red days.

2021-06-05 12:36:08,wallstreetbets,"Don’t worry, I’m not selling. Just jacked based on recent DFV and Cohen tweets making me think something big is coming next week. I’ve held for 5 months, what’s another year at this point."

2021-06-05 17:32:43,wallstreetbets,"Wrong. How can AMC raise $500M cash last week? Where did that money come from? Who gave it to them?

2021-06-05 17:13:18,wallstreetbets,Not too bad a bet. You at least avoided this friday. The ctb fee of amc is still high at 11.8% down from 20% so some of the heat is off shorters. The GME meeting can push the meme stocks either way so im gambling on volatility
2021-06-05 17:33:46,wallstreetbets,"That cash came from whomever was willing to buy the stock at a certain price.  And yes, I know for sure it came from more than retail!"
2021-06-05 17:42:38,wallstreetbets,A gamma squeeze happens on the lead up to a Friday not the day of. This is because market makers stay delta neutral as the calls get closer to the money. If you dont know this maybe you shouldnt be so arrogant
2021-06-05 17:38:41,wallstreetbets,This proves you do not have basic understanding of market fundamentals.

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TGT is going to 300+ EOY So now that many of you apes have had fun playing around with worthless companies, Allow me to present some solid due diligence on a solid profitable company gaining more market share year over year in the incredibly competitive retail environment. I will divide my bull case for $TGT into 4 sections.

1. The story that Q1 earnings told us/new PE ratio of 19:

They absolutely set themselves apart from every other retailer. By posting an absolute blowout quarter (3.69 EPS actual: expected 2.25) driven by strength in apparel and general merchandise, they basically told investors that they can deal with inflation much better than Costco or Walmart that have a much higher dependence on groceries which have lower profit margins. Additionally Target owns personal brands and this allows their profit margins to increase. For apparel they have Goodfellow, grocery they have good and gather, market pantry, and a new dessert brand called Favorite Day. By popularizing these brands, they are able to cut out the middle men for products that don’t require a massive brand name to sell. 

2. Semi Re-Opening Play

Going forward they have announced they are opening up changing rooms as Covid restrictions wind down. Many people viewed Target as a covid winner, however I believe that their apparel department can allow them to also function as a pseudo-re-opening play. With a PE ratio of 19, it is likely that the stock continues to go up with little to no near term catalysts especially if the market continues to go up. They have tough comparisons to compete with especially for Q2 2020, however they most likely can surpass that quarter if they continue to post sales of high margin products. They literally beat earnings every quarter. These guys are ruthless in cutting costs, that’s why on slower days if you walk into a Target you’ll barely any employees. They actually don’t give a fuck and will bully the few people running the store into doing as much as humanely possible.

3. (Target)ing the right demographics and easy access to urban markets

Target has announced plans to continue building stores in areas they deem a great opportunity to steal market share from competition. Like putting stores near by college campuses. In recent years they have built mini Target stores in places all over New York City and other densely populated cities (before Amazon Go had any chance to establish itself) Walmart doesn’t have a reach in this environment because their business model revolves around suburbia and rural markets. The design of their stores, the products they sell are all designed to gear towards a younger millennial Gen z population. Go to a target, literally any Target. They are all the same, you’ll bump into some chicks, employees with highlighted hair, and you might see some younger people wandering around like they’re lost ducklings. I don’t think these habits will go away even when the economy fully re-opens. 

4. The e-commerce strategy has been working

This one is rather self explanatory. The omnichannel strategy has been incredibly successful. Far more successful than Walmart. Surveys have indicated that these habits of using shipt and order pickup will persist in the new economy that is forming. They also compete with Amazon on their prime day with no extra charge to consumers and price match whenever they have a sale on something to stay competitive. 


TLDR: TGT is a solid re-opening play as we keep some habits from the pandemic and profit margins go up. My PT for TGT is 300 by the end of the year. 

Current position: 46 Jan 22’ 280/290 call debit spreads"
2021-06-05 09:56:49,wallstreetbets,I love going to target and looking at all the moms with their fat asses and yoga pants. So much better than WalMart where everyone is missing a fucking limb or eyeball and has a physical or mental deformity of one kind or another. Target also has one of the cleanest public restrooms in the game and it's always right by the front door. They've saved me from shitting my pants on multiple occasions.

2021-06-05 10:00:04,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the DD, but we can’t get distracted. Turnaround stories frequently look like they are about to go under at some point 

Maybe AFTER the current story line plays out and the retail investors get their payday and corrupt companies get their karma,

THEN, we can put this stock on a watchlist for evaluation. In the mean time, you may want to join the team and make some 💰💰"
2021-06-05 10:44:20,wallstreetbets,Their subsidiary Shipt doesn't provide access to all Target stores. Which leads to customer unsatisfaction in some areas

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TELL - 83x their revenue with the two 10y contracts - Still low market cap - I am missing something or 🦍🚀🌚 ? Posting again, since last one got deleted due to wrong flair.

Ill try to put it as down to the point as I can. If you dont want to read - there is illustrative picture for you.

Tellurian, the new gas giant in our solar system has recently finished two contracts...

* Their 2019 revenue was 28,77 million.
* May 27 - Tellurian and Gunvor Sign 10-year LNG Agreement for 3 mtpa ( 12b + 1.2b yearly revenue )
* June 3 - Tellurian and Vitol sign 10-year LNG agreement for 3 mtpa ( 12b + 1.2b yearly revenue )
* 12b + 12b = 24b ( 2.4b yearly for next 10 years )
* Their market cap is still sitting at 2.05b
* 2.4b / 28,77m = 83x ed revenue in 10 day span,  their market cap only multiplied to 2-3 from already depressed prices, not even reaching precovid valuation - drastically lowering their p/e.
* 2.4b yearly for 10 years, is fairly safe spot to develop their new Driftwood LNG facility
* Profit (?)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Thinks to consider:**

*  \- This revenue is based on ability to develop 20b plant - that is set to start building in Q1 2022
*  \+ Charif Souki is founder of Cheniere - I and other investors will see this as proven ability to get funding for that plant.
*  \+ Once the plant is done, value of the company increases by 1100% by the value of assets alone...

2021-06-05 11:46:31,wallstreetbets,"Convinced some people at work to buy, they got in at low 2s on this last dip. Also bought shares with my mothers IRA 5k shares at 2.08. I hold 7.5k shares and a handful of options. I think natural gas just isn’t fun for most people. It is not a sexy or mainstream play. Buying at this 5 range Guarantees you a double up by at least the EOY, unless I am sorely mistaken or we see crazy market turbulence. What is more is entering at $10 still has huge upside in the next 5 years. Personally I see anywhere from $10 - $20 once FID is announced and Driftwood construction is truly underway supposedly Q1 2022."
2021-06-05 18:35:44,wallstreetbets,Okay let's just lay some facts here. Charif Souki founded Cheniere which is an 80$ stock. It does LNG sales. Charif Souki founded TELL which also does LNG sales. You can put 2 and 2 together.

This stock is a sleeping giant. Granted nothing is guaranteed, these contracts only make money once driftwood is built and actually offloading Nat Gas onto ships, that is why the price is still suppressed and this remains speculative. Having said that, do I believe the construction will happen in the next 12 months? Fuck yeah I do. People who have followed this stock know that delays have happened and all sorts of setback(including a pandemic). Patience is key here and keeping tabs on the progress of the project. Souki has managed to keep his word and stick to the timeline this year as far as when deals would be announced and other progress markets for Driftwood."

2021-06-05 12:13:05,wallstreetbets,"Layered answer here: I plan to recoup some of my initial investment through my options contracts and hold my physical shares. I would always suggest that taking some profits at some point is smart if for no other reason than to have cash on the sidelines for new opportunities or to reinvest in TELL. I think in 5 years we see that $50 - $80 dollar price. That seems like a good exit area to me. Most Nat Gas analyst think that the resource has a strong window for the next 10 years. So I don’t think you need to completely exist the position in 5. Of course it could be much more valuable and they could be growing or creating other projects. Things like carbon capture tech and entering into hydrogen gas could keep this company relevant much longer than 10 years. With all companies you invest in it is important to keep tabs on it, at least on a bi-weekly basis. 5 years is a ways out and so much can happen. This stock could also catch fire in a Reddit retail sense and we could zoom to $50 and then crash back somewhere. At such point I would sell and re-buy. As long as the company
Stays relevant. I will hold 1k shares for the $100 moonshot."

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I analyzed all the controversial trades made by Senators in the 2020 Congressional insider trading scandal. Here are the results! **Preamble:** The ability of Congress Members to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. There have been multiple stories covering the 2020 congressional [insider trading scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal) where Congress Members allegedly used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash. But none of the articles talked about the financial implications of those trades and whether the retail investors could have front-run the market using the disclosed data.  Basically, what I wanted to know was

**How much did the Senators save by offloading their positions before the crash and could I have done the same?**

**Where is the data from**: efdsearch.senate.gov

For my [previous analysis into congressional trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/n958n7/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_us_senators_in_the/), I used data from senatestockwatcher.com. But not all the transactions are captured on the website and I wanted to match exactly with the trades reported by famous journals. efdsearch.senate.gov is the United States official website where Senator, former Senator, and candidate financial disclosure reports are available. Some of the data is available as a scanned file and some in normal HTML format. I had to manually transcribe most of the data used in this analysis.

In case you are wondering about the time delay between the actual transaction and reporting, Congress Members are expected to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/). The median delay in reporting that I observed for all the trades was 28 days.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

There are multiple factors at play here.

Timeline: On January 24, 2020, the Senate Committees on Health and Foreign Relations held a closed meeting with only Senators present to brief them about the COVID-19 outbreak and how it would affect the United States. I am considering this as the start time for my analysis. Any sale made by the senators after this point up to Feb 26 is considered. (I did not consider sales beyond that point as SPY dropped 8% during that week. My assumption here is it’s realistic for any person be it a normal investor or a Senator to panic sell after seeing that drop). For reference, SPY dropped an additional 25% over the next 3 weeks!  

Senators under consideration: I have considered trades done by 4 senators in my analysis. I have focused on these 4 as all of them were investigated by [Justice Department and the FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal) following the trading scandal.

1. Richard Burr
2. Kelly Loeffler
3. James M Inhofe
4. David A Perdue

https://preview.redd.it/owzxgiv17g371.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbb5ec251a813bfcaf6d954b3992263b167ebdbd

David Perdue sold 44 times ($3.49 MM) in the 33 days following the closed senate meeting. Interestingly James Inhofe only transacted 8 times but the combined value of shares he sold was a whopping $4.12MM. The most ironic part is that Richard Burr who was under investigation the longest and had to step down from the intelligence committee due to the scandal had the least dollar volume in the transaction ($1.1MM).

**Results:**

Before we dive into the overall amount saved by the Senators and the retail investor side of the analysis, let’s see what were the best trades made by the Senators during that time period.  

https://preview.redd.it/zzkp2rh37g371.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=02669d67934a2bc1e4b0dc54f5a4ff97860c8b0e

 David Perdue absolutely killed it with his stock plays. He is present 7 times in the top 10 list and his best play, Caesars Entertainment reduced 83% after he sold his position. Fun Fact: if a stock reduces 83%, it has to go up 488% just to reach back to its initial price. Another interesting observation from the chart is that senators mainly sold stocks related to the entertainment and hospitality industries which were the most severely affected industries due to the pandemic. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/vzd0kq757g371.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec18cc544fefb81597f8929af51b299cf36edc65)

The above chart showcases the amount of money saved by the Senators due to front running the market crash. David Perdue saved an insane $2.2MM with his stock sales. I also kept a multiple of annual Senate salary to showcase the scale of impact they made to their portfolio because of the trades.

Finally, we come to the million-dollar question. **Was it possible for the retail investors to follow these trades and front-run the crash?**

This is where the analysis gets a bit tricky. 88% of the transactions were reported by March 3rd but if you consider it in dollar values, only 52% of the transactions were reported (some of the high-value transactions were reported only after the crash). But if you were an astute investor, you could have observed a stark difference in what the Senators were saying and how they were trading. For Eg. [Richard Burr reassured the public that the US was well prepared](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/5/14/21258560/senator-richard-burr-coronavirus-insider-trading-scandal-explained) for the pandemic but then sold $1MM worth of stocks in the next two weeks. I know that hindsight is 20/20 but if you could have connected these two dots, then you could have saved up to **25% of your portfolio** before the crash.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are some limitations to the analysis.

a. I have only used one black swan event for the analysis. A better method would be to analyze the stock trading pattern over 3-4 major crashes and see if any pattern emerges. But the current limitation is that efdsearch.senate.gov has only data since 2012.

b. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress Members. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the transaction amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion**

I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Senators as I did not want our political views clouding our financial judgment. I could not find a single example where a retail investor or an institutional investor or even a hedge fund leveraging this information to make their trades (it might just not be public!). Another possible explanation here is that Senators might just have superior stock trading capability as [none of them were indicted for this and all investigations are closed now](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/richard-burr-stock-trades-investigation.html).

However you view it, this analysis in addition to my [last analysis (which proves that Congress Members have better returns than SP500)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/nsvk50/i_analyzed_all_the_controversial_trades_made_by/) showcases that there is significant money to be made by following their trades closely!

Only investigates Republicans, claims this with a straightface. There have been so many cases of Democrats and Republicans insider trading for decades now. Warren won points for pointing this out during the Obama admin. Pelosi and Feinstein, actual leaders of the Democrat party for decades, have been called out for trading on their info for years.

But sure, this isn't political bullshit. Just ignore the comments here from our new ~~/all~~ ape friends talking about how the RNC is run off of dirty money, and the ones being downvoted for pointing out that Democrats seemed to escape your notice.

Institutions had access to the same data and had already started analyzing it in the same way, and moving money based off of these decisions.

As a typically back seat, poorly informed individual in the market, even I was able to avoid a huge loss just by looking at what was happening elsewhere. All sides of the news media were spinning the same data in their own ways, but it didn't take an expert to look past that to see that something spreading virally overseas would eventually spread everywhere else."

2021-06-05 11:25:57,wallstreetbets,Great write-up! There is a lot of old money floating around congress and the senate. I'm surprised only these 4 specific politicians stand out as the dollars being traded are not particularly high relative to the rumored portfolios of other politicians.
2021-06-05 11:43:34,wallstreetbets,I think you also need to figure out what the information disclosed in the private senate meeting was and whether that information was readily available to the public. Many of us here sold shares and bought puts around the same time based on the same evidence. COVID case data and the rate of spread and panic was very easy to find.

If the Government is all about Red tape and wasting the peoples time and keeping them in the dark about plenty of things( not a bad thing in anyway other that the time being wasted sometimes).

In Jan 2020 the industry knew 2020 was going to be a down year. Covid just made it worse. I'm not surprised at all to see anyone selling those stocks at that time, but perhaps the wholesale offloading is a bit suspicious. Like, if you think a bad year is coming sell *some* stock, but not all. If you *know* beyond a doubt a bad year is coming, say from a looming pandemic, sell it all."
2021-06-05 18:16:45,wallstreetbets,I find it interesting that they are all buying at the same time and dumping at  the same time. The 30 day delay allows for maximum profit because those who are following the Senate will have a 30 day delsy for sales. I think the Senate needs to report all investment purchases and sales over $100.00 withing 72 hours. For full transparency.  Otherwise they are corrupt.

The closest you get to actually something logically relevant is the hospitality and entertainment industry sell offs. But that can easily be explained by a common pattern of the hospitality and entertainment industry waning during the late winter early spring time periods. 

In order to see if it was truly insider trading or abuse of intelligence, measure their trading patterns from 2019 and 2018. Determine if there’s a statistical significance to their trading behaviors in 2020.

Edit - If you analyzed my trading patterns, because I swing trade based off of sector analysis(among other things), you’d see a similar pattern. And I most certainly am not privy to pre-pandemic national security briefings.

Burr was specifically targeted because he wanted Americans to know that the Trump Campaign (and other GOP elites) really did work with Russia in 2016 to help get Trump elected.

2021-06-05 15:44:01,wallstreetbets,Is there a way to use politicians stock investing as potential signals for us to buy and sell in near real-time -over time?
2021-06-05 15:45:12,wallstreetbets,Is there a way to follow their trades closely and replicate them?
2021-06-05 15:45:43,wallstreetbets,Insider trading isn't illegal for politicians. Isn't that why none were convicted?
2021-06-05 15:46:42,wallstreetbets,there's a lot of missing information. what about senators who weren't under investigation? did they (the ones you studied) also buy stoks during this time? how much a senator typically buy / sell? what do they do before a big boom? were they able to time the bottom? why did ceasears fall 83%... was it only due to the covid or were people following the senator's trade?

2021-06-05 19:23:12,wallstreetbets,If congressman do a trade they must be legally obligated to hold the shares for a set number of time. It would prevent them from dumping shares from insider info like a loss of a contract or a global event/crisis and dumping before the public finds out. This isn’t a perfect solution but it would have added more stability in the markets and less corruption
2021-06-05 19:26:51,wallstreetbets,That the nature of the medical emergency.
2021-06-05 19:44:06,wallstreetbets,"Yup they do, but not made."

It’s in fintels top100 likely to squeeze. Now that they are being added to the Russell shorts are screwed and cannot double down. They shorted us down from $28, with the buying pressure from the Russlle, APEs, TTM scanners we can squeeze much higher due to such a small market cap."

2021-06-05 12:33:01,wallstreetbets,"Never to take the side of senators, its gotta be a rough prospect to leave a meeting knowing you're going to lose ALL your money, and just let it happen. I guess that's why they get good sized paychecks."

2021-06-05 17:02:52,wallstreetbets,Imagine how rich we'd be if we had access to this type of information. Imagine how fast the sec would be down our throats while ignoring anyone of power. Honestly this is part of the reason why I bought amc. Shit like this reminds me of how useless the sec truly is. How many ceos were arrested during the 2008 financial crisis? How many of those lectures by Democrat/ republican lawmakers to ceos and bank employees were followed through by swift legal action? This country and system is a fucking joke.
2021-06-05 17:19:59,wallstreetbets,Id like to see info on Diane Feinstein as well. I think it was reported she traded 6mil before the crash. Fuck all these leaches

2021-06-05 11:04:20,wallstreetbets,If you get shares allocated you can definitely make money. If you’re buying in the secondary market the day of the IPO you will probably be under water on those shares for 6-12 months.

2021-06-05 11:40:30,wallstreetbets,"I have no doubt one can make money of an IPO, are you doing this from the perspective of a senator investing in an IPO or anybody? If senator I'd imagine it would have to be a very lucky event where a company was entering the market just as laws were being discussed that would cripple them in the senate. Like if Facebook IPOd when the US was about to launch a GDPR clone."
2021-06-05 12:30:35,wallstreetbets,"I'll try.  No, you can't make money on an IPO.  If you do, it is based off of pure enthusiasm trading."
2021-06-05 12:53:03,wallstreetbets,Do they get to participate in private investments? The past twenty years people with access to pre-ipo were making out like bandits.

2021-06-05 13:27:52,wallstreetbets,I will bet that the average return is in the 10s with exceptional ipos being dragged by a few firms
2021-06-05 13:28:46,wallstreetbets,"That’s already been studied and the results were yes. Based on buying opening day and holding long term. Some would fail and some would skyrocket over time but most land somewhere in the middle.

2021-06-05 13:32:32,wallstreetbets,Very interesting!
2021-06-05 13:40:06,wallstreetbets,"The traditional view is that the only way to reliably make money on an IPO is to be a pre-open subscriber. I.e., buy from the promoting banks. A privilege extended to almost exclusively wealthy investors. Now, that’s not to say that EVERY IPO subscriber makes money; rather, that the likelihood of making money on an IPO is WAY higher as a subscriber than as an opening day investor. 
   
I have a personal theory (not exclusively mine, but way less widely-held than the subscription theory) that you’d do better to buy at the one-year anniversary of the opening than on opening day. By then, most of the BS patina has been scraped off by a year of 10K disclosures."
2021-06-05 13:55:13,wallstreetbets,"Awesome work, OP"
2021-06-05 14:00:57,wallstreetbets,IPOs based on when restricted shares expire (for shorts) might be interesting too.

My bet is if you held every ipo for 1 quarter and then sold (so buy on market and sell on market), on average you will be profitable (compared to benchmark of sp500) but the median will be not be compared to the sp500 benchmark. If you include buying pre ipo, add 15% to annual returns."

Everyone who ever invested? Or simply being positive from the date of ipo ..even if that is say 1 cent after 10 years. 

Id bet on average in the last 10 years, average ipos on major exchanges are up overall. However ipo day and week tends to see initial people sustain losses. 

Facebook. Dropped at ipo' grew since

Beyond meat exploded at ipo. Dwindled since.

Tough call, and not sure the metrics.

2021-06-05 19:03:49,wallstreetbets,"Check out The Lifecycle Trade. Usually, buying on the first day (to hold) isn’t the best strategy. You want to buy them out of a base like a cup and handle pattern."

2021-06-05 15:57:43,wallstreetbets,Perhaps.  But they are only required to report trades within 30 days and OP said the median he is seeing is 28 days.  So your ETF would lag by a month and miss the volatile spikes that they are (allegedly) using insider information to beat.
2021-06-05 14:02:15,wallstreetbets,"I was told that there’s a way to see exactly what Nancy Pelosi does trading wise and that it’s generally guaranteed gains with some losses thrown in so it doesn’t look obvious

2021-06-05 10:19:50,wallstreetbets,Exactly. The information assymetry between a Senator and a retail investor is immense
2021-06-05 10:36:28,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't even give them that. Blind trust for every single member of Congress for their entire term of service, mandated and enforced. Same for the executive branch."
2021-06-05 11:43:01,wallstreetbets,Easy loophole. So many ETFs heavy in a particular company or sector.
2021-06-05 13:37:46,wallstreetbets,">congressman should have no ability to trade single stocks or futures

I honestly don't know why this isn't the case yet. Every financial and business related profession with privileged information is barred or pretty restricted on trading. Public officials should be held to an even higher standard!"
2021-06-05 13:57:21,wallstreetbets,Either that or someone make a Congressional Stock Picks ETF so we can all get in on this action.
2021-06-05 12:13:11,wallstreetbets,"I would say no trading at all. You either write the rules or you play the game. Not both at the same time. Want to serve the public? Sell off your stocks. Most of these people were already loaded. It’s not a big deal to them. And when their terms are up, go back to trading as they desire."
2021-06-05 11:59:38,wallstreetbets,They should be forced to hold dollars and stop printing money like it’s going out of style
2021-06-05 11:09:24,wallstreetbets,"No limits and when they click sell it goes to the retail investor as the market maker who can then freeze trades to lower price, lower network bandwidth seemingly coincidentally, and force purchase at a lower price with no chance of indemnity. Customer service is a forum of equally angry hedge funds that just have to talk to one another. Why? Cuz fuck em, that’s why."
2021-06-05 15:37:59,wallstreetbets,"I would go further and say only broad index funds or target retirement funds. E.g. - VTI or VTSAX. 

No thematic investing. No individual stocks.  No derivatives.  No sector specific funds. No geographic specific funds. No industry specific funds. I would even go as far as to not allow shorting anything either.

There are too many thematic funds that can have outsized gains or losses by congressional decisions. E.g. - PBW, GRID

It is a privilege to serve the American people. Senators shouldn't try and serve themselves in a way the American people cannot. Senators shouldn't bet on the decline of American prosperity. If senators want to play wolf of wall street, then don't be a senator. Their salary allows them to become millionaires, if they weren't already a millionaire, or even billionaire....

It is just ridiculous they are allowed to do what they do now. I'm not sure what is more ridiculous....senators in USA insider trading, or Romania changing their laws to permit bribes - but only bribes under a certain dollar amount. 

Right now, senators in USA can make trades up to $999.99, and not disclose anything. Nothing illegal about making a large number of sub-1k transactions either.....

Ridiculous"
2021-06-05 16:20:23,wallstreetbets,"ETFs would have similar issues, especially because more focused ETFs would pop up with crazy leverage, e.g. a 12x GAMA ETF with GOOG, AAPL, ~~MU~~ MSFT, and AMZN. There'd probably be a 24x military ETF within a year or two. Lol.

(I did not consider sales beyond that point as SPY dropped 8% during that week.

I'm sure there were quite a few senators who participated in inappropriate trades during this time. However, we don't know who, and as u/nobjos mentioned, he had to manually transcribe a lot of the data, which means he had to base who he researched on some objective criteria.... like being the only 4 investigated for their actions.

Technically this is not true but I get what you are saying. 

For e.g., in case of TD [Ameritrade,](https://www.tdameritrade.com/investment-products/IPOs.html) your account must have a value of at least $250,000 or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months which is a tall order for a regular retail investor."

2021-06-05 13:17:46,wallstreetbets,"Eh, Pelosi bought 5,000 shares @ $44 a piece. Her husband is a real estate investor and venture capitalist  who’s worth $20+ million. If you were going to act improperly, you’d figure you’d go big, instead of investing $220,000. 

Hell, the visa IPO was something like $17,000,000,000. Her take was like a thousandth of a percent. She also held the stock and bought more after it rose in price. I kinda recall she sold some during the financial crash and lost money. 

Let’s be real here. It was a Visa IPO. Everyone knew it would make money long term. It’s not like she sat in a confidential senate meeting and heard the economy would shut down due to a pandemic, so she invested in work from home technology companies. She bought stock in a proven company and held the stock long term. I don’t know. If that’s illegal, then all senators shouldn’t be allowed to trade stock and would have to use a money manager to make investments. Also, they couldn’t talk to them short of saying “I need to liquidate $500k to buy stuff.”

Edit - Congress did pass the Credit Card Act of 2009 which was signed into law. The text of the bill reads like the 2008 bill, so I believe you’re misremembering the facts."

There are reasons that cast serious doubt on that story: 1) Her husband's stake in the IPO was  microscopic, compared to the size of the IPO and the stakes that other institutional and wealthy investors had in play. and 2) He never took a profit on it after the IPO, he held the shares for years and actually sold some at a loss. 3) Most importantly, soon after that she passed the Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights and the Dodd-Frank legislation which banks and CC companies lobbied vigorously against. 

I'm not saying it doesn't happen, or that she is squeaky clean, just that this particular instance doesn't make a strong case for it."

2021-06-05 14:15:48,wallstreetbets,"Genuine question- is it considered ""insider trading"" to mirror a public figure with no actual knowledge of the motivation behind the trades other than that the trades were made?  I would consider that a significant stretch.  How is that any different than matching market trends?"
2021-06-05 17:56:17,wallstreetbets,And what is that way?? Would love to know.
2021-06-05 19:17:07,wallstreetbets,What is that way and is it live?

2021-06-05 14:00:56,wallstreetbets,Not only that. Most of these clowns were downplaying covid to keep their pockets flowing while knowing full well it was about to kill half a million Americans. Negligent homicide.

2021-06-05 12:24:33,wallstreetbets,I thought they were already forced to do this or am I misinformed. I thought the criticism was that they just informed whoever was running it that they should sell.

2021-06-05 16:18:29,wallstreetbets,I would even go further than that. There should be a time limit after leaving office where they can’t trade stocks because otherwise you can change the laws as your term ends and get straight into reaping the benefits.

2021-06-05 15:15:19,wallstreetbets,"""or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months"" wait this isn't a tall order at all, you could easily fill this requirement with penny stocks. Are you sure that isn't supposed to say and instead of or?"
2021-06-05 14:59:17,wallstreetbets,I mean sure but you still probably won't get allocated any shares especially for an Ipo with hot demand
2021-06-05 19:23:45,wallstreetbets,"There are plenty of IPOs who’s first trade is well below the offering price. In fact the vast majority of deals are fairly boring, companies generally don’t like the idea of leaving cash on the table in issuing shares at $20 and the first trade is $50, they left $30/share on the table theoretically. The unicorn tech darlings that you see skyrocket and the companies don’t care, because for them the IPO isn’t really to raise more capital, it’s just the next step in their growth for a number of reasons, is not the norm. 

If the bookrunners do their job correctly they should have an slightly oversubscribed order book on the open at a price the company is satisfied with that investors will except, as demand from the order book isn’t fully met with the ipo allocations these people obviously have to go into the open markets to purchase the remaining shares they need to establish their desired positions, thus making the stock go up some. Part of the allocation process is the bookrunners making sure they aren’t giving too much of the deal to people who are just looking to sell as soon as they can mark a profit, specifically with the large institutions they want long term holders who will support the stock in the open markets by purchasing on weakness. Obviously a large fund isn’t going to sign some agreement stating they will always buy the stock when it drops, so again this is where the bookrunners make their fee in building a good order book. Have to give the right people enough of an allocation so it’s worth their while, but not too much that they never go in and buy more especially on down days. 

There’s also the trend that now days companies aren’t as reliant on the raise of funds from the IPO, as I mentioned earlier. Usually the strategy is a smaller ipo in terms of the actual number of shares sold, with the hope that it has a good 3-6 months of appreciation in the markets and is at a significantly higher price when the company does a much larger dilutive follow-on offering for a larger amount of cash that’s much more important to its actual strategic growth plans. IPOs are very expensive IBD fee wise and very time consuming, every roadshow trip with the C-suite is time they aren’t actually doing work growing the company. If you’ve ever been at a company in the process of going public it might seem like things kind of come to a halt until it’s all completed. Large follow-on offerings (also seeing a big uptick in bought deals which are even cheaper from an underwriting concession standpoint) have fractions of the fees and time commitments that the IPO does, even if they have to price it at a deep discount to the prior days closing price, it still is likely much higher than where the IPO priced at and there will likely be more appetite for shares at this point than during the IPO for a variety of reasons. 

The numebr of people in IPOs that actually sell them right at the open for a profit is a relatively small afterthought on most order books if it’s a big enough name where the bulk of shares are going to your fund shops like blackrock, fideltiy, capital group, Schwab, PIMCO, Invesco, Vangaurd, etc. the only reason smaller retail investors or small institutional players like family offices or hedge funds get an allocation is as a “thank you” so to speak for participation of less attractive deals that will likely be down or flat best case and take some time to unwind. Hedge fund A puts an indication for $10 million worth of some small REIT or boring mid-cap industrial stocks follow on knowing full well they will likely trade below the re-offer price they paid, but they do it because they get taken care of when your hot IPOs come around. It’s a balancing act, but it’s not just some secretive society that is getting shit rich on all IPOS then sell them to retail investors on the open market before it tanks."

2021-06-05 13:59:10,wallstreetbets,"Could be. And yea I guess you make a lot of
Good points. But how much acting improperly gets attention? Like crime pays but the criminal usually gets caught or made an example of when they get too greedy. 

And to be honest I didn’t realize they passed it 2009 a Bill similar. But the optics of defeating a piece of legislation that would benefit the visa ipo is suspect. But yea her trades are low compared to other offenders. But she has been in congress a long time. It is the ichiro effect of trading keep hitting singles and no one notices. Go for the grand slam aka Aaron judge and you will get pointed out. 

And I believe that Congress people should never have been allowed to trade individual stocks. When actions they take or information they learn will have an impact before the general retail
Investor will ever hear about it."
2021-06-05 15:01:22,wallstreetbets,I guess I am remembering it wrong. I thought they sold shortly after the IPO happened and then reinvested back into Visa. And held. But you could be right. I don’t remember where I read about it.

2021-06-05 15:15:52,wallstreetbets,"The opposing side would try to argue that you are getting the same outcome as someone who is insider trading, except you just copy them. Is it illegal to copy someone doing something illegal, if you don’t have the knowledge that makes said act illegal?

The only way you are able to make those trades/profits is by someone else committing a crime. Would that count as illegal, or just smart exploitation of a situation? 

If truly believe that the Congressperson doesn’t have insider information and you copy them, I’d assume it wouldn’t be seen as illegal. 

If you believe they do have insider information but aren’t sure, I’d assume it would be in a grey area. 

If they have been convicted of insider trading and you copied them, it’s even more of a grey area.

Over 2000 Americans become millionaires every, single, day. While many may share similar stories to how they started, there is a mentality at play along with education.

2021-06-05 12:03:57,wallstreetbets,Also there are two things going on. Insider trading and stock dumping.  If we’re going to complain about one we should complain about the other.  In the long run the people who are magically getting tips on stock techs that were in a bubble but went up in late 2020 made more money than people who dumped stocks
2021-06-05 19:42:44,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I will look for an explanation with bananas.

2021-06-05 13:53:40,wallstreetbets,How depressing. Fuck these assholes making real estate ever less affordable for normal people.
2021-06-05 16:02:20,wallstreetbets,"Their biggest money makers are their real estate holdings, that part is true. But that’s spread across 9 properties. I spot checked the rest of your post. 

Her husband owns 25 Point Lobos Ave. A Walgreens rents the commercial space. It’s in a desirable area near protected federal land. But so is everything in downtown San Francisco. There are no BART stations near the building. 

Her husband also owns 45 Belden Place in literal downtown San Francisco. It’s a 4 story commercial building. Admittedly I didn’t look too long, but he’s owned it since at least [2003](https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Pelosi-disclosure-she-s-worth-a-bundle-8-from-2609213.php). Honestly, most of these properties listed in the 2003 article are their current holdings. And spoiler, real estate values in downtown San Francisco have skyrocketed the past 30 years. 

So come on man. Your assertions are not true. I believe you’ve read some kind of disinformation which attributed federal money to protected forests/wildlife sanctuaries as well as federal money to the BART system, as some kind of scam. All of their real estate holdings are in Northern California, so of course they’re near areas which would’ve received that grant money anyway. Also, federal funds aren’t used to “rejuvenate neighborhoods”. They can be used for disaster relief, like earthquakes for instance. But Congress doesn’t pick out random neighborhoods to pour money into. Your post is very misleading at best. 

She’s got a lot of other things in her closet to be pissed about. Illegally making money doesn’t seem to be one of them.

Edit - I also checked their winery in Napa Valley, which is the most valuable asset they own. They purchased it back in 1990. Nancy Pelosi was first elected in 1987. A winery in Napa bought 31 years ago… seems to me that it’s value would rise exponentially. They paid 2.35 million back then. Of course it’s worth $10+ million today. I’d bet it’s nearer the top end of the disclosure, which is $25 million.  It’s a god damn winery in Napa Valley, sitting on 16 acres of grape vineyards. She also doesn’t sell Pelosi branded wine, she sells the grapes to other wineries. Try buying that today. I’m not sure anyone would even sell one. **She also has never passed legislation that benefited her Napa Winery**, so that is another hole in your assertion."
2021-06-05 12:35:36,wallstreetbets,"Im really interested as well in where one can find this information.
Seems a good strategy would be to keep a close eye on what the top players are investing in and follow their lead, although with smaller amounts of cash"

2021-06-05 13:41:53,wallstreetbets,Not sure. Follow the links in the linked barrons  article. All congressional members have to report trades over $1000 within 30 days. So you can dig this up yourself.  Wall street bets is where i heard of this originally.

2021-06-05 12:22:31,wallstreetbets,She was pretty instrumental in including the green energy incentives in the COVID relief bills. It's another example of how she invests and then legislates to help her investments.
2021-06-05 12:42:03,wallstreetbets,Diane who? Feinstein? just curious...
2021-06-05 13:56:01,wallstreetbets,More than Pelosi and husband? Are you smoking!!!
2021-06-05 13:21:57,wallstreetbets,I personally don’t care if politicians sell their stock if they know bad times are coming. I’m more concerned about the politicians that push for policies and legislation in the name of “helping people” when it’s really just to help their stock picks.
2021-06-05 14:22:20,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah. I worked for the federal government for 3.5 years. It was a crime for me to trade individual stocks. They literally fined and locked people up who got caught even passing information to family members. If I was forbidden from doing it because there was a possibility I would learn something from my bureau’s specific mission which would give me an advantage (slight), why the hell are people who get a top level overview allowed to do it? 

At least we had to go through the process of back ground checks before starting our jobs. They can be high school dropouts who believe a secret group of pedophiles secretly run things while drinking babies’ blood, and they still get an office. Like that would’ve come up in my security clearance interview and I would’ve been denied, **hard**. 

I guess if we’re going to look at senator’s stock trades, it would make way more sense to look at all the financial disclosures while they were in office and chart their overall gains, while comparing it to the average Joe Schmo returns. That might get skewed though since the stock market has tripled in value over the past 20 years. Hmm, maybe taking a look at those gains in office compared to Joe Schmo’s average returns, which are then tied to their votes on specific bills that ended up benefiting companies they owned stock in…. That sounds like way too much work though. I have one job, and that’s enough work for me. I already know the outcome of that data anyway. I’d bet $100 senators beat the average return and vote to protect their own investments 90+% of the time. Why do all that work when we know?"
2021-06-05 14:51:38,wallstreetbets,Wait so congress gets to have stocks while the average citizen goes to jail for type of things like not paying taxes or so robbing people? So my tax dollars went to the very same corrupt a-holes? What the F. But why is it they don't go to jail if they themselves made inside trading? Let alone them corrupt multi millionaire bankers?
2021-06-05 19:10:10,wallstreetbets,There are A LOT of trading days between IPO day and 48 months... The stocks didn't take a calm stroll down 17%.
2021-06-05 18:54:56,wallstreetbets,I think its because M is shorthand for thousand.
2021-06-05 16:20:31,wallstreetbets,"This, 45 days is the time from January 1st to February 15th. GME went from closing at 17.25 January 3rd to 347.51 on January 27th and back to 49.51 on February 16th. By the time they've filed you've missed the boat."
2021-06-05 15:51:19,wallstreetbets,"Of course it's not illegal to copy to someone's trades even if their trades were made with illegal insider information.

Now this runs into potential issues the closer your relationship is to that trader. It could be construed you reasonably held knowledge, he possessed insider knowledge even if it wasn't wholly and openly shared with you."
2021-06-05 15:57:12,wallstreetbets,"We also have to consider the sheer amount of times people get “investigated” for insider trading versus the amount of times people actually get in trouble for it. It’s an absolute joke. Therefore I think the risk of you getting in trouble, even if it was considered illegal, is virtually non existent."
2021-06-05 15:59:58,wallstreetbets,But it’s not technically illegal for congress people to insider trade. And they’ll never vote to limit their trading.
2021-06-05 19:13:43,wallstreetbets,Lmao top tier deflection right here
2021-06-05 14:28:13,wallstreetbets,Surely politicians would have enough class not to be a loud mouth on Twitter?

2021-06-05 15:26:21,wallstreetbets,"agree with the first part, disagree with the second. there's old money in both of those crooked ass drama camps."
2021-06-05 16:13:56,wallstreetbets,"What about the explosion of increasing inequality coupled with steeeeeeply declining economic mobility? 

Many people don't run for office because it costs lots of money and you can't really quit your day job. If we cut out all private funding of campaigning then we'd be on slightly more level ground.

Beyond that though: a businessman true purpose is to make money and an elected officials is to serve the public. They both manage organizations but that's where the similarities end. It's two different, often diametrically opposed ways of approaching the world."
2021-06-05 14:56:19,wallstreetbets,"One of the most surprising things to me when I became old enough to vote and started watching primaries etc. was the emphasis on how much money each candidate raised. 

My favorite candidates have always been off to the side in debates and I assumed that meant they were less popular, until I thought about how voting hadn’t started yet by the first debates... then I learned that the center stage is reserved for those with the highest funds, a direct influence of money on who will win an election. And the center stage from the first debate has been largely the same as the final contenders. 

The most frustrating part is that in the last 3 elections all but 2 candidates had dropped by the time primaries reached my state... There are some major flaws with the current system"

2021-06-05 14:35:29,wallstreetbets,"Yes but you also want competent people - and competence and a decent income generally go together.

2021-06-05 15:16:00,wallstreetbets,Thank you good sir!
2021-06-05 13:12:32,wallstreetbets,Yeah for sure. Congress should not be aloud to trade. However if this is really what they are doing then just follow what they are bringing to leg and vote on it.  Pelvis ain’t innocent but Purdue Loefler and Feinstein were as shady as a hedge fund short seller.
2021-06-05 13:07:01,wallstreetbets,"Investing in the same things you legislate for is totally unsurprising by itself. ‘I believe in this thing’ is a reason to both invest in and legislate for something.

2021-06-05 14:28:25,wallstreetbets,"For sure that is too much work to go and chart long term stock trades. I am not allowed to trade on specific subset of equities either based on my job. And it wasn’t until Obama that they made insider trading illegal for congress people. Which wasn’t passed unanimously. Go figure. The rule for thee are not for me. What is the stat like 95% of congress people are multi millionaires and many didn’t enter that wealthy. 

Just like how congress votes for their own raises or to add money to their tax payer funded health care system, ie socialized health care, which as rich as they are they don’t need subsidized or free health care. And I believe they get a 100% pension after one term of service. Best benefits on earth and they are filthy rich."
2021-06-05 14:58:59,wallstreetbets,"Well they investigated themselves and found they didn’t didn’t do insider trading. But it was fully legal to trade on insider information gained through their job up until 2012 or 2013 I think. 

But yea Martha Stewart went to prison for insider trading but no one from congress."
2021-06-05 15:39:19,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Bill Janklow got drunk, ran a stop sign, and killed someone. He spent 100 days in county lockup. William Jefferson was charged with bribery back in 2005, won his reelection, **served his 2 year term in the house**, lost in 2008, and then got 13 years in prison. 

I guess the moral of the story is, as long as you don’t kill anybody, just keep wining your reelection campaigns so they can’t send you to jail. If I took bribes for my job, or committed manslaughter, they wouldn’t leave me alone until I quit my job. I’d go straight to prison."

I’ve always been questioning why the shutdowns occurred when the virus was having pretty minimal effect on the healthy population. If it were only a high death rate in the elderly and people with lowered immune systems, why was it that the shutdowns had to be enacted on the entire population rather than just the vulnerable? It simply didn’t make sense to me as we saw a significant amount of businesses go under and close shop due to the economic impact as well as perfectly healthy people going on unemployment which just furthered the toll on the economy.

2021-06-05 15:26:28,wallstreetbets,"It’s funny you mention pot. At the risk of devolving into politics, a democratic convention last year decided whether they would support the legalization of marijuana on their platform. They voted 105-60 against the movement ([source](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5f1f9250c5b69fd47310aca7)), even though 76% of voters registered as Democrat support legalization ([source 2](https://news.gallup.com/poll/267698/support-legal-marijuana-steady-past-year.aspx)). 

The source I linked in my previous comment mentions that the people who wrote that article reviewed 20 years of data, and found a statistically non significant, near-zero relationship between public opinion and the likelihood of legislation being passed. It also references the upwards of $10,000,000,000 that goes to lobbying our representatives."

I am sure she thinks that green energy is the right way; I do too. But I believe that lining your own pocketbook with your elected power is bad. Had she legislated and *then* invested in Tesla, I would have no issue."
2021-06-05 14:40:30,wallstreetbets,"Don’t be in charge of legislation you’re going to financially benefit from.  Sure, it might be win/win, but in reality, it’s also a handy way to get major kickbacks for pushing legislation that may not be in the people’s (the people they supposedly work for) interests.

For example, is it really good for California’s overall well-being for housing prices to be 10x the national average?  Is it in the majority’s interest if one richy-rich neighborhood gets all the perks while everyone else gets fukt?  

Not really, no"

2021-06-05 14:48:27,wallstreetbets,"While some of those senators benefited from their office to become wealthy, I think most of them are just benefiting from being a boomer. All of their houses are worth 15 times what they paid making most of them a millionaire technically. They’d also have 30 years of stock market gains compared to a newly elected 35 year old. 

Senators have a good racket going. Most of them rent places in DC from lobbyists who charge them well below market rate. Some pretend they’re all about fiscal conservatism and sleep in their offices, using free tax payer funded electricity, water, a roof, the internet, etc. Somehow we’re paying for their lodgings and they don’t even have to declare it on their taxes. 

Anyway, democracy is broken and we might as well be ruled by an aristocracy since laws they pass are never meant to apply to them. Plus half of them stay in office for 40 years. Just call them what they are. Baroness Pelosi and Viscount McConnell (I have no idea which title is higher though, so plug in whatever works). 

Total side note though, I’m not saying we need term limits. I’d just like us to elect people who have a strong sense of service above self. Limiting those people would be detrimental to our country. If we deny stock trading and have a lifetime ban for all senators becoming lobbyists when they retire, I bet we clear out a lot of the money grubbing dicks. Sorry, this got more political than I wanted."

It’s about shifting your tolerance as you see the market change and not getting emotional. If you can’t do that, don’t increase your risk of you’ll lose it all when the market changes."
2021-06-05 18:20:15,wallstreetbets,"> sits on 1x annual salary of cash

First off, if you don't have an emergency fund then you should calculate 6-9 months of living expenses and put it into a high interest savings account. Interest rates are crap right now (~0.50%) but it's safe and it's losing less value to inflation than just sitting as cash. Most people say 3-6 months but I figure 6-9 months savings would be more comfortable for you.

After that, do an assessment of any debts you have. High interest may be good to pay off quickly. Low interest you might beat in the market, but a guaranteed win is a guaranteed win.

Risk is much easier to take on when it can't cause substantial harm. With the essentials figured out, you're free to YOLO without worry of losing the house."

2021-06-05 14:56:32,wallstreetbets,I completely agree but they have created ways to keep them in and keep new blood out. Money runs politics and corporations pay for them and run ads against competitors. Even the news is biased. I was a big Yang supporter at the beginning and they went out of their way to make it super hard to get stage time and limited his interaction in debates. things need to change. How? Who knows. When half the country is hook line and sinker into a cult it would be hard to form a unified front to demand change. They believe the enemy is not the politicians or the wealthy and they think they will be there too or play to their hatred and fear of others. While living in conditions that are worse than some 3rd world countries that I have been too. At this point is seems like it will be a war of attrition. As the boomers die off we need to make sure their replacements aren’t going to tow the line.
2021-06-05 15:25:10,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think there are any secret cults. They don’t need it. They do it all out in the open.  They set the system up to support them and the media is largely complicit as many of the people in the c-suites or boards are fairly well connected and they are co dependent on each other. People always look for the secret cult but the truth is they don’t need it. Decades of influence and picking the federal justices, legislation and lobbyists make it good. 

Like a lot of the corporations gained traction with Reagan as he was a poor legislator and was easily swayed when it benefited him. The Reagan’s on showtime is a good documentary. The rich work together to keep the “human capital” distracted and in line and fighting each other. Which is why the government killed the leader of the black panthers. He was trying to organize the gangs as they weren’t each others enemies. A divided enemy is easier to conquer."

You’ll be set for life due to all the connections you make. Harvard classes won’t teach you better stuff, it just puts you in a room with others who are insanely rich and connected. No need for an Illuminati club or something. They all go hang out at the Harvard club in NYC and you can’t go in since you didn’t get into that college. 

They drink brandy, give each other insider trading information or handys, and they talk shit about the poors. Probably. I went to a state school so I don’t know. It’s how I imagine it at least."

2021-06-05 15:56:59,wallstreetbets,"I think you're confusing a couple things. It wasn't part of the pandemic relief bill, it was an omnibus spending bill which pandemic relief was folded into. And it wasn't a sticking point for Republicans, it had the support of  GOP leadership. It extended tax credits that already existed and pushed back deadlines for new construction. Literally nobody thought that Congress was going to allow those credits to expire during the pandemic. It wasn't exactly insider knowledge."
2021-06-05 15:31:25,wallstreetbets,"I mean it is fiat currency. As there is nothing other than the faith and credit of the US government will remain solvent and support the USD as a currency and that it has value. 

Realistically it is not printed out of thin air and has to do with issuing debt at the federal
Level to support the money supply. But that add or removing currency from circulation was one way they managed inflation targets."
2021-06-05 15:29:02,wallstreetbets,"Well I would encourage you to vote or become politically active and get your friends too. Just like weed has been kept illegal for so long bc there are people in congress who were around when segregation was still a thing. And many of them voted to keep black people and minorities subservient to the whites. 

More people need to be involved. If enough people care to make a stand and drive for a better outcome for all then as cliche as it sounds starts with voting. But it is also your right to not vote and I understand when it feels like nothing will change. But the largest voting group is the group that doesn’t vote."
2021-06-05 15:56:56,wallstreetbets,"Do you see the circular reasoning? No offense but it sounds like you would change nothing, as though things are working...

Money, and the pursuit of it do not define competence. Those pursuing money are CLEARLY money motivated, as you seem to be. Not everyone is like this (spoiler).

I'm sure you're not implying that EVERY competent person earns well over 50k.

I'm sure you don't think that the average rep is intellectually elite, nor do they need to be to do the right thing. 

There's no need to put PUBLIC SERVANTS on a pedestal where they regularly inside trade and leave office with millions more than they had before."

2021-06-05 12:23:43,wallstreetbets,"I think its within the realm of possibility.   The election was close-ish last time, with noted irregularites regarding then Secretary of State Kemps potential influence on the election

From the wikipedia page on that election:

Kemp retained his office as Georgia Secretary of State throughout the campaign, leading to allegations of a conflict of interest for overseeing an election in which Kemp himself was a candidate. During the campaign, he was called upon by former President and former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter[227] and the Georgia chapters of the NAACP and Common Cause, to resign. Kemp refused to do so[228] until after he claimed victory, two days following the election. Kemp also accused the state Democratic Party of hacking into the state's voter database a few days before the election; however, an email released shortly after the accusation was made showed the party warning election security experts, highlighting ""massive"" vulnerabilities within the state's My Voter Page and its online voter registration system, not an attempt to hack the database, as Kemp had claimed.[229]

Irregularities in voter registration occurred prior to the day of the election: over 300,000 people were wrongly flagged by the state as being ineligible to vote,[230] and 53,000 voter registrations were delayed by Kemp's office without adequately notifying the applicants.[231] These irregularities, which disproportionately affected black voters, resulted in allegations that Kemp was using voter suppression to increase his chances of winning the contest.[231] Georgia election officials responded to these allegations by stating that any voter flagged for irregularities could still vote, receiving a regular ballot (not a provisional ballot), by providing ID at a valid polling place, as is required of all voters by state law.[232] Concerning the question of why the pending registration status mattered if those voters could vote normally at the polls, critics claimed that learning of this status might discourage those voters from turning out to the polls at all.[233]"

I guess I'm retarded that I still hold PLTR but at least my cost basis is $23.

My only winning plays the last two months was buying PTON at the $83 dip and CRWD at $175. I hold BABA leaps but will see how summer goes with them. Bought NVDA after selling some boomer shit on vanguard to get 25 shares at $630ish."

2021-06-05 08:23:28,wallstreetbets,Can anyone help me find a option trading platform in Canada?
2021-06-05 09:12:30,wallstreetbets,Holding till 500
2021-06-05 08:09:57,wallstreetbets,"Ima be real with you buddy. Sell that shit no later than next Friday. If AMC goes tits up you don't want the feeling in your stomach of watch $200,000 disappear. Especially not since your up 5000%"
2021-06-05 09:43:09,wallstreetbets,A beautiful sea of green 🤑
2021-06-05 09:47:56,wallstreetbets,"What's the target?
I mean, what's a realistic target? This bs of 100k/share is plain stupid."
2021-06-05 10:13:00,wallstreetbets,Holy crap
2021-06-05 12:42:11,wallstreetbets,I have learnt a lot from this sub in the last two weeks but I still can’t properly read and understand these charts. Anyone know a good guide / site / video for learning? How did you learn? I want in on this!!
2021-06-05 16:33:47,wallstreetbets,Does your wife need a boyfriend?
2021-06-05 16:54:58,wallstreetbets,I give you some of my money and you make me profits too 😍
2021-06-05 08:52:14,wallstreetbets,"Buying more Monday 
Holding more
And holding until it reaches the highest point 
Then I’ll sell on way down from that high 
But I’ll also keep some to support the cause 

Not financial advice 
Just passion and love for the movies"
2021-06-05 13:35:18,wallstreetbets,"going low 30s this week, cash in would be the smart move"
2021-06-05 09:18:38,wallstreetbets,Went from 1100 to 288 then all the way up to 14k on robinhood and 6k on Webull. Thank you apes. 🚀
2021-06-05 11:40:14,wallstreetbets,Congrats you made more then I have in 10 years of working.... Fuck it must be nice to have the money to gamble
2021-06-05 12:13:14,wallstreetbets,Damn I wish I knew how to do options
2021-06-05 17:31:45,wallstreetbets,"Celebrating when your gains are funded by other apes losses

2021-06-05 08:58:13,wallstreetbets,"I have $20k in ready cash for investments. I am not rich. I am a thrifty MF who lives way below my means. I drive a car I paid $5000 cash for that gets me over 30mpg. Gonna drive it until the wheels fall off and start over. Also bought my house during the market cash in 2009, today I've seen a 200% return on that investment. Work/live/invest smarter, not harder.  

And congrats on your gain porn... that is impressive and you should be proud of that turn. BTW.. fuck you. I've never seen that much return. If I had, I would be LOADED."
2021-06-05 08:10:44,wallstreetbets,He wasn't already rich. Judging by his percent gain he started with less than 10k
2021-06-05 10:48:03,wallstreetbets,"that’s what I say, I say figger it oot, give yer balls a tug"
2021-06-05 14:01:04,wallstreetbets,"Gains used to be a lot smaller before Corona Crash and Short Squeeze Craze. If you know the ""GUH"" meme, that was kinda the norm... Then the Robinhood Glitch.... Then it just kept getting higher and higher.

2021-06-05 10:37:38,wallstreetbets,Ya me either
2021-06-05 15:46:37,wallstreetbets,Over $120+
2021-06-05 11:09:27,wallstreetbets,$140 + $
2021-06-05 10:35:40,wallstreetbets,"$7.

Just upgraded from $6."
2021-06-05 12:46:57,wallstreetbets,If it reaches even 50k a share you can come fuck my wife
2021-06-05 10:06:19,wallstreetbets,That is extremely unrealistic lol. It would be a massive win for anyone involved if it even touched $100 per share.
2021-06-05 08:58:51,wallstreetbets,I use TD and then do all my trading in my TFSA so I don’t get hit with tax for cashing out.
2021-06-05 09:56:15,wallstreetbets,I just TD but you will be paying minimum $22.50 USD to buy and sell one contract/sell it.  Basically don't make any plays if you aren't spending at least $500 or the fees will be brutal.
2021-06-05 15:49:20,wallstreetbets,Agreed.  I only have two weeks left on the contracts. So finding a good day in the next two weeks will be it
2021-06-05 09:10:50,wallstreetbets,Agreed.
2021-06-05 15:48:06,wallstreetbets,North of $120
2021-06-05 10:14:52,wallstreetbets,"My guess is that anywhere between $80-$100 would be good shit for anyone who invested in. To expect 100k is insane, Amazon isn't even close to that lol. Only one stock in America is above 100k right now (BRK)."
2021-06-05 19:36:09,wallstreetbets,Learn trend patterns. Then you’d notice that amc formed a double top and will be heading back down.
2021-06-05 17:16:57,wallstreetbets,"I recently bought PLTR, SNDL, and QS options.  Do your own research as to price and date.  Best of luck!"

2021-06-05 11:07:10,wallstreetbets,U just said my life bro.. ur my twin
2021-06-05 08:20:11,wallstreetbets,Having anywhere near 10k to risk on a stock is rich to a lot of people
2021-06-05 18:31:41,wallstreetbets,"Proud ape here... started with 450.00 last year, now sitting on almost 25k... it’s not a lot, but is descent work."
2021-06-05 08:36:06,wallstreetbets,"He definitly started with more than 10k, just saying🦍"
2021-06-05 10:32:00,wallstreetbets,Imagine having 10k to throw around and not thinking you're rich 🧐
2021-06-05 15:41:33,wallstreetbets,How tf could anyone turn away a quarter million dollars.  At that point you've already won depending on how much you started with.
2021-06-05 17:18:40,wallstreetbets,cause 250k gains isn't a billion gains
2021-06-05 17:16:45,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-05 19:10:11,wallstreetbets,I also have 140 calls expiring June 21st 😆
2021-06-05 17:44:28,wallstreetbets,Do you think it's gonna happen in the next year?
2021-06-05 18:36:59,wallstreetbets,dibs?
2021-06-05 10:33:55,wallstreetbets,"Impossible. Not enough money on earth.

But, sure hold until 100k."
2021-06-05 09:00:28,wallstreetbets,"Thanks I’ll look into that, they have an app you can use and everything ?"
2021-06-05 16:54:36,wallstreetbets,It hit 68. That wasn’t a good day for you? Lol
2021-06-05 12:20:01,wallstreetbets,Lmao same. I’m a Jew though so that shits in my blood.
2021-06-05 08:38:42,wallstreetbets,"Commenter above posted ""...I turned  200$ into 13k..."" while stating that people congratulate people who were rich to start with on big gains which I assumed inferred that OP was rich to start with. While $10,000 is a lot to most people, it's certainly far from ""Rich"" as the commentary themselves noted by stating that they had turned 200 into 13000. For all we know OP started with 200 and has worked up to having more through good trades."
2021-06-05 08:24:32,wallstreetbets,I would say most people don't have an extra $100 to put into stocks or savings on any given month or year.
2021-06-05 12:40:16,wallstreetbets,Or that was his life savings lol
2021-06-05 19:24:44,wallstreetbets,Brother turning 450 into 25k is amazing. Where else could you get returns like that?
2021-06-05 08:42:52,wallstreetbets,"Doing quick math on his gains and percent gains he started with almost exactly 10k. Really besides the point. As I noted in another comment, my criticism is more the idea that he was rich in the sense of having funds that far exceed what others here are playing with. As the commenter above pointed out, they themselves turned 200 into 13000 so this guy could have too."
2021-06-05 15:43:55,wallstreetbets,"I'm broke af, $10K isn't rich."
2021-06-05 12:11:55,wallstreetbets,It's just 10k....Not life changing amount.
2021-06-05 11:34:08,wallstreetbets,Rich people never think they are rich.
2021-06-05 15:44:46,wallstreetbets,A truly stupid person.
2021-06-05 16:32:53,wallstreetbets,Greed.
2021-06-05 17:28:06,wallstreetbets,I had 260k in profit. I'm not in it for change. I'm in it for millions and life changing money. Let's go! Holding 4xxx at 13.57. 🚀🚀🚀💎🤚 Yolo!
2021-06-05 10:46:03,wallstreetbets,"My reasoning isn't based upon the amount of money on Earth, but by comparing to other stocks. Only one in all of America is above 100k, and Amazon isn't even halfway to 10k. So to expect something like AMC to push up to 100k is bonkers. It ain't hitting above $80-$100 imo, but that's okay as it would still he a good win for anyone who bought in when it was below $50."
2021-06-05 09:02:37,wallstreetbets,Welcome=) Yup it’s just the regular banking app and then when you select your TFSA account it switches you over to web broker.  Trade fees are a bit steep (10 bucks per) but since TD is my main bank anyways I like being able to shift money between accounts easily.
2021-06-05 17:22:17,wallstreetbets,It’s in a gamma squeeze.  That’s why I bought the contracts in the first place.  I’m going to wait until the final week to evaluate as the shorts still haven’t tapped yet.  Hoping that comes between now and then.  That’s part of why I got this far..  diamond handing it.  Many would have already cashed.  Few actually hold out like they talk about it
2021-06-05 19:42:21,wallstreetbets,Nothing to be proud of 🤮
2021-06-05 08:41:54,wallstreetbets,To be clear I did not intend to be critical of your post. More commenting on the definition of rich is different for many people. Have a happy Saturday
2021-06-05 09:11:57,wallstreetbets,"Nice.
Where are all the beginning posts, explaining how to place such orders and take that risk to build up money?
Was it DFV activities starting to explain to others?
If AMC stock goes up a little more, I will
Also have 10k starting to buy options👍"
2021-06-05 11:33:23,wallstreetbets,"People who are well off, I won't say rich, never think they are well off.

But this sub makes a lot of people who are already very well off (some in rich https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-executives-home-millions-cashing-231012999.html), make a lot of money will pretending it's mostly just working and middle class."
2021-06-05 19:25:54,wallstreetbets,"Nowhere, and to think that all I had to do is trust my fellow apes 🦍"
2021-06-05 08:47:54,wallstreetbets,"Yup if he really started with that, thats pretty insane.. Youre right tho and the commenter above his too.. the most impressing to me is not the price, but the fact that of he got this %. His average cost is probly 2$ lol.. wich gives him the right to fuck all our wives 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-05 13:31:42,wallstreetbets,10k in spare... play around money
2021-06-05 19:03:08,wallstreetbets,"Idk about that. When you have a Bentley you only use to go to church, you know something."
2021-06-05 16:27:18,wallstreetbets,"dats me. Well The drop actually happened thursday when it straight plummeted on opening day, nothing I could've really done."
2021-06-05 17:29:20,wallstreetbets,@alkoa Tell that to hedgefunds. We are in it for life changing money. 250k isn't life changing but it is def a start. Holding to the moon!
2021-06-05 12:41:17,wallstreetbets,"I know language like this isn't allowed on this sub, but you are completely misunderstanding market cap. Stock price is a function of the number of shares in existence relative to the total value of the company. Berkshire A shares are only so high in price because there aren't as many of them and they don't want to do share splits."
2021-06-05 15:58:03,wallstreetbets,"Some people have no extra money to spend and are rich. Majority of people here confuse wealth to being ""rich"""
2021-06-05 16:22:33,wallstreetbets,"One could borrow 10k to do that. However, it depends on your stage in life. 10k in your 20s typically would mean more to you than when you are in your 30s."
2021-06-05 16:39:39,wallstreetbets,"Sorry about that, that really sucks."
2021-06-05 17:38:56,wallstreetbets,"My friend, if you think hedge funds don’t make money right now you wrong. They don’t only short stock you know. 
If 80% of AMC float is held by apes, to who are you really sticking it to?
If you knew funds were making so much money in the past, why didn’t you study and replicate their strats?"
2021-06-05 12:46:11,wallstreetbets,"The reason for why it is as high as it is wasn't my point though. I was pointing out that if there is only one stock currently above 100k, with most others not being even close, then AMC certainly won't be getting that high. Better off betting on winning the lottery than having AMC hit 100k per share."
2021-06-05 16:49:45,wallstreetbets,I could've sold the day before I guess. But no one could've predicted that AMC would sell off 12 million shares the day after it's best high before it even peaked imo.
2021-06-05 13:52:05,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but what you still seem to be missing is that _100k or even $3 is an arbitrary metric when comparing two different stocks prices. You might as well compare how many employees wear blue shirts at each company"
2021-06-05 14:46:09,wallstreetbets,"I'm not missing that, I'm just setting realistic expectations. 100k is far away from a realistic expectation for AMC. It is pretty logical to look at something as big as Tesla or Amazon, see that they are nowhere near 100k (Tesla not even 1k), and say to yourself ""AMC isn't touching either of those and therefore will not touch 100k."""
2021-06-05 15:14:59,wallstreetbets,"You still don't get it and that's okay. I'm not trying to be an asshole, but market cap is what is relevant here.

If AMC did a 1:1000 reverse split tomorrow, their share price would be almost 50k, but it would change literally nothing about the value of your position or of outstanding options or of the value of their share price compared to other companies. There would be fewer existing shares, so each would be more valuable.

What you need to compare is the market cap of differing companies at a given stock price. The stock price itself is completely useless by itself as a metric of value for comparing two different companies.

You could look and say that ""at 1000/share AMC would be worth more than xyz company which doesn't make sense and wouldn't happen."" You can't say ""AMC can't hit 1000 because Tesla isn't worth 1000.""

The stock price itself is completely meaningless when comparing to another stock."
2021-06-05 15:33:03,wallstreetbets,"So if you're not trying to be an asshole, may you please explain why AMC to 100k isn't a borderline impossibility? Because no matter how I look at it, I can't see it happening. It is just a meme stock, and it doesn't even have the traction of GME."
2021-06-05 15:52:01,wallstreetbets,"It is functionally an impossibility barring the use of reverse splits I mentioned above. I'm not disagreeing with you on that. But the reason it is impossible isn't because of the stock price itself, it is impossible because of the number of shares.

There are 515,000,000 shares of AMC. If the stock price goes to 100k, it would mean AMC is worth 515 million x 100k =  $51.5 trillion. 

For comparison, Berkshire Hathaway which is trading at 439,000 per share is only worth 667 billion (0.6 trillion).

The issue isn't the stock price, it's the stock price in conjunction with the number of shares."
2021-06-05 16:01:30,wallstreetbets,"Ohhh okay, I am starting to see what you mean here. So it isn't that AMC will fly to 100k, it is just that my reasoning behind it not doing so wasn't quite right? Gotta take both price and number of outstanding stocks into account?"
2021-06-05 16:08:38,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. The specific price of a share of a company is completely meaningless compared to the price of a share of another company. The total value of a company compared to another is what matters, so you have to compare market cap which is share price x number of shares in existence."
2021-06-05 16:40:59,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense, thanks for helping me understand all of this better!"

CLOV is interesting because it is now included in Russell 2000 and 3000. Jun 25 is the inclusion date, so there will be a rush to cover short positions before the index tracking funds buy CLOV. Sure to get some gains here."

2021-06-05 07:26:27,wallstreetbets,"AMC and GME are the priority, for sure, but if anything else was ripe for shorting, it would be OCGN with over 21% verified shorts, and more in the dark pools. The enemy Shitadel has 808,000 short shares alone. Plus, there are 6 or 7 catalysts over the next 2 months to squeeze with.

As a side note, they make the only vaccine that does not fuck people up. So there's that. 😂😂😂"

2021-06-05 12:34:12,wallstreetbets,You realize the company was never fully dependent on that contract right? Like people are still putting in orders for their fleets. Also Dejoy is under federal investigation and OSK was awarded only 10% of the contract. Research is key 🔑
2021-06-05 07:41:22,wallstreetbets,Now here’s a person who understands something
2021-06-05 09:05:38,wallstreetbets,I can't invest in cannabis companies or I lose my job. How is that for a load of BS? Not even an invested mutual fund.
2021-06-05 11:43:38,wallstreetbets,Difference here is ACB is actually a steaming pile of shit so they’re right to short it
2021-06-05 13:06:01,wallstreetbets,Get outta here. Not interested
2021-06-05 10:18:47,wallstreetbets,"Correct, that it how short selling is supposed to work, but in practice it is mainly used as a predatory tactic to ruin businesses that honest investors had high hopes for"
2021-06-05 11:37:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah a company losing value gets shorted which drives them down even more but there’s a point where hedge funds get greedy. Imagine if hedge funds were able to drive down GME or AMC stock dirt cheap just because they THINK the company is done for, the company would raise their debt instead of selling stock cause its not even worth it. Oh wait that’s what actually happened lol The point isn’t about buying up companies with value, it’s buying up the heavily shorted that hedge funds got greedy on. In the end they get a reality check, we make tendies, and the stock of the company goes back up in value which hopefully they capitalize on so they can improve the business."
2021-06-05 13:54:34,wallstreetbets,"If you mean like AMC or GameStop, then yes you’re correct. The problem for the short sellers is that those companies are so shitty, shorts have overcrowded the trade and can be taken advantage of."

Always report it, even if you are a little unsure.   Reports we work through in batches so not always an immediate result but we try to be quick. 

If you ask for positions and they ignore you or you see someone and their comments are basically copy paste you can tag me or chat me. I’m online a lot and check pings frequently. Good way to deal with severe spam and market manipulation attempts."

2021-06-05 13:40:58,wallstreetbets,"Not gonna lie, I believe it's blackberry season soon and they are 😋"
2021-06-05 14:11:00,wallstreetbets,"Back when the U.S. Department of Defense started allowing Blackberry ""Email Phones"" to be used by commanders overseas, our brigade's S6 shop got some in and started configuring and issuing them out.  
Eventually I got issued one not because I was a commander but because I was pretty much the only person in the entire brigade who really knew how they worked and how to configure them properly and fix them when they ""broke"".  
Not bad gig at the time for a dumbass tanker with just a high school diploma.  
  
tl;dr I like Blackberry because their products got me out of a lot of shit details in the Army back in the day and my nostalgia about not having to literally burn shit on deployments is currently overruling all other data about the stock.

The thing is most of the platforms I found have metatrader 5 in it and I can't fin Amc or bb on that app. Also it's not on FBS or olympic trading or Xbt.

Hope someone who have an idea about an app or a website that have those and support non US citizen (specially in North Africa) could toss me some info.

I missed the Amc thing I was planning to buy at $24 been looking for a platform didn't find anything that suit me."

1. Helping Ken Griffin and citadel make money on their 15-18 mill reported investment...

If I'm wrong and this isn't an inside job I won't sell all on Monday. But this stinks of an inside job.

2021-06-05 10:04:24,wallstreetbets,It'll be for an undisclosed amount. If it wasn't then it'd be something that'd materially impact BBs business and have to be disclosed. Could be like the IP sale I guess where they just say fuck regulations and don't disclose right I guess. Who knows with Chen and gang.

2021-06-05 10:55:39,wallstreetbets,I don't think the patent sale or the lawsuit was finalized in time to be included in the last earnings from what I remember. And the Amazon deal is undisclosed but shouldn't have any impact until cars are connected anyways. Soon 10 cars ahead of you one car will tell your car that there is a upcoming pothole.

2021-06-05 12:52:52,wallstreetbets,I mean they are supposed to disclose material developments that would have an impact upon the company in a timely manner.

2021-06-05 10:29:44,wallstreetbets,"Not in it’s entirety. But the retail investors who don’t have any clue what they’re doing, claiming DD when they just take the first post on subs like this and yolo everything because it’s what other people online (mostly bots and fake accounts from what Ive been seeing) are posting about. There’s no real way of knowing who is legit and where to securely invest if all you do is stare at Reddit. I doubt 80% of the people on subs like this even understand how to properly read and breakdown the ticker let alone decide where to invest in their own and let’s be honest, if you can’t take the time to learn something as simple as that, you don’t need to have A NATIONAL INFLUENCE on a market you can’t comprehend."
2021-06-05 09:42:58,wallstreetbets,"Yea. And if you want to gamble. Go to a real fucking casino, stop trying to tank a worldwide market that hundreds of millions of people depend on to function. It’s going to be really fucking hilarious when this shit causes the US market to crash again. Or maybe the SEC needs to start looking into all of you short sellers to see where your money really comes from? How many of you have been naked short selling? Maybe I’m just sick of seeing the world decline over what some fucking morons online think should be popular. Everything happening now is going to have a long term impact to the market and it’s not going to go the way everyone on this sub thinks it is. You’re all being played."

2021-06-05 10:51:38,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it's a free market, but we all know it's heavily manipulated and controlled by large institutional forces, the ""smart money.""  If we want to make money as retail, the best we can hope is to ascertain the smart money move, and take positions in harmony with it...

...but EVERY ONCE in a while, an opportunity arises for retail to successfully move in OPPOSITION to smart money.  An opportunity to make money while also forcing smart money to take losses AND expose their shady manipulation and collusion.  Meme stocks are that opportunity right now.  Although a lot of idiots are in meme stocks thinking their 4 shares are going to 1K value, most of us are using discretionary funds to stick it to the smart money.  I'd the market tanks, but hedge fund tactics are brought to light and regulated, then it's a win in my book.

The meme stock phenomenon is like the end of trading places.

Mortimer: ""How could you do this to us after everything we've done for you""

Valentine: ""See I bet Winthorp here that we could get rich AND send you'll to the poor house... I Won!""

(In this scenario, smart money and everyone screaming at meme stock retail investors (you) are represented by Mortimer Duke)

This is exactly what we are trying to accomplish. The only people that are going to tank the worldwide market are the ones siphoning billions of dollars from the lower classes through blatant market manipulation such as naked shorts and dark money exchanges."

2021-06-05 08:59:37,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-06-05 11:05:09,wallstreetbets,"See I agree with everything you’re saying here but you’re one of the informed investors that isn’t risking their life savings over hype. I agree that if the market tanks that would be wonderful, opening all kinds of doors for new investors as the market rebuilds. What I’m more concerned about is that the market bypasses tanking and full on crashes. There are thousands of families that rely on what little bit of flimsy stability is left in the market and a huge crash would be devastating. If history is really doomed to repeat itself, our country couldn’t handle a repeat of the ‘29 crash. So yea I suppose a lot of my hate for the meme trend stems from my own personal  (potential) losses in a situation, like so many others in the country, should everything go south. But I also believe that a lot of the people dumping money left and right into the trend haven’t taken into consideration the long term damage it could potentially do to the families like mine who break their backs being underpaid to do the work all the people screwing the market take for granted."
2021-06-05 10:47:35,wallstreetbets,"Part of what I’m trying to say though, it’s not just the big companies. Since this meme stock takeoff I’m sure there are some people who (without knowing it due to lack of DD) have been naked shorting 6+ figure worth of options. It’s not a bad thing at all to try and bring down the corrupt rich. I’m all for it. But what we need to do is actually educate each other. Instead of just shrugging someone off when they ask for help (which this sub if infamous for) we should be helping to properly inform each other. Bring the real information to the masses of people who, instead of actually researching for themselves, just jump on the next $$ bandwagon. THOSE are the people that are going to hurt us long term. Uninformed decisions almost always end terribly and the market that helps sustain our country is not something to be treated like a casino."

2021-06-05 07:52:26,wallstreetbets,"I'm finding it very difficult to get a proper answer to this anywhere, so I'll ask here if you don't mind: I'm an AMC investor from all the way back when it was worth around $10 per share two or three months ago. I had assumed this was a classic case of shite luck, as I bought 20 shares at that price immediately before (as in, less than twelve hours before) they announced that they were further diluting the float, thus (I thought) nuking the chances of a short squeeze by essentially allowing shorts to cover without having to convince apes to sell. Felt like one of those ""shit happens"" moments.

In the intervening time period, there have been several other moments of apparent dilution. However, apes here and on the AMC subreddit keep talking about how these stock issuances don't actually count as dilution, and the media is misleading people on the true nature of the issuances.

My question is, what's the actual story here? I'm more than happy to hold for a squeeze or even just for the stock to naturally go up based on post-covid recovery, *but*, it does strike me that the peole running in AMC seem to have an unquenchable thirst for stock dilution (somewhat understandable given the company's financial situation due to closures) and therefore, it sort of feels like no matter what we apes do, any kind of squeeze is slipping away into the abyss as a realistic possibility, the more the float gets diluted and thus the more opportunities shorts have to cover without having to come begging *us* to sell our own investments.

What am I missing here? So many people are posting that none of the recent issuances are relevant to what we're doing as far as attempts to squeeze the shorts, but nobody so far has actually explained how this could be the case."

2021-06-05 15:26:43,wallstreetbets,"There’s not, this is bullshit lmao"
2021-06-05 15:31:26,wallstreetbets,"I wish I sold when I hit my high of $17k. I am back down to $12k, up 8k total. But you know, here is the thing. AMC BOTTOM price week over week has been going up. So we see higher lows, week over week. As long as that trend keeps pushing, I am going to try HARD to buy options at the bottom and sell them/roll them at the top. Not financial advice. I am just guessing, but higher bottoms are a good bullish sign."
2021-06-05 08:06:29,wallstreetbets,AMC had like 200 million shares available from like 2002 or something. In the last year they have sold at market all but 45k shares.  The float is 503 million. If all 3.2 million apes are holding we own the float.  Shorts have not covered. Shorts must buy back all registered or fake shares. Just hold my friend. It cost us nothing to hold.  I would assume your up if you bought in January. We have the power to deny AMC any more shares. That must be voted on. The float will stay at 503 million. We got this.
2021-06-05 16:05:41,wallstreetbets,I had a search and couldn't find anything about it either.
2021-06-05 09:25:49,wallstreetbets,"Everybody keeps saying the same thing about GME too, what we've learned is that other than an initial bump or squeeze, the shorts can hold out indefinitely. They can use dark pools to draw shares from and to initiate naked shorts, we know that they can use this to manipulate the stock price and drop it. So at a certain point don't you have the risk of being a bag holder?"

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PXT as a potential oil play Parex resources is a crude oil company that operates within Canada and Columbia. It is a small-medium cap company with a market cap of more than 2.8 billion. The stock appears to have an interesting technical picture and appears to have a good fundamental base seeing examination of its statistics.

Examination of the statistics of the stocks paints a good picture. The P/E falls at about 15.05, a P/S of 3.93, a P/B of 1.67, and a P/Cashflow of 8.36. While these metrics aren't unheard of, they are at a level that suggests some fundamental stability. The debt to equity ratio on this stock is 0, which suggests that in an environment of rising interest rates PXT may have less to worry about compared to its more heavily indebted peers in the oil industry. 

The thoughts of analysts on yahoo finance also appear to be positive. The stock currently sits at around $22 a share. However, analysts currently give the stock an average price target in excess of $25, with a high of more than $27.

Looking at the moving averages, the stock has an interesting technical position. The stock price has recently broken above it's 30 day and 50 day simple moving average. Currently, price sits above the simple moving averages and exponential moving averages for 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 200 days. These moving averages can present support levels on the way down. Having had the price break through all of these former resistance levels implies positive momentum upwards. The 10 day simple moving average just crossed above the 20 day simple moving average, which may indicate a more conservative buy signal to some technical traders.

There is some political risk however, seeing as it has some of its operations in Columbia. It also may share some volatility that may be associated with changes in oil prices.

2021-06-05 10:47:01,wallstreetbets,"This doubles as a chart of inflation.  

Notice how calm and consistent everything was pre 1920.  Pre Federal Reserve.  

You could put cash under your mattress and it would still have the same value 45 years later when you retired.  Money is cut in half every 10 years now.  Your dollar you saved for retirement will only be worth .08 when you retire.  

We are forced to invest and gamble with our life savings or lose it to inflation as savers.  Fuck the FED."
2021-06-05 02:41:27,wallstreetbets,"The further you go back, the less it says. It's so hard to put this in perspective,. You have to compansate this for inflation to start, and I mean, REAL inflation not the 2% bullshit.

What is the reason why a man with an avarage job could provide for his stay at home wife and 2 kids and now 2 working people are struggling to get a house and pay the bills? Has the standard of living grown faster?

Aging is also a thing, people just don't die anymore, and we are using a lot of money to stay alive longer. This will even out in the next decades but we got used to that exponensial growth. There are so many people resources are getting scarse, we have exceeded earths limit long ago imo.

But these major problems are still not the largest contributing factor. Inequality is.

*edit because it caused confusion*
If we would *create a system that* redistributes every dollar owned by people who have over 100M (company money excluded, only personal cash) a lot of problems would just vanish. There will always be balance, don't think there can be super rich without a lot of super poor.

O, the graph.. I might have wondered off a little. Enjoy your weekend and remember you are voting for the future every time you spend your money."

2021-06-05 12:16:23,wallstreetbets,"This chart is not a great way to look at things because it does not figure in the reinvested dividends or inflation. Dividends are very important to the history of the stock market returns because companies used to pay much larger dividends than they do now. To prove this point, let's compare returns in some periods, one which looks terrible, and one that looks pretty awesome on this chart, and one really sad one.

| 30 year period | Price return | Inflation adjusted Price Return | With reinvested dividends |
| ---------------- | --- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Peak in 1929 to 1959 | 82.27% (2.02% annualized) | 7.62% (0.25% annualized) | 436.15% (5.76% annualized) |
| 1965 to 1995 | 440.23% (5.78% annualized) | 12.14% (0.38% annualized) | 246.61% (4.23% annualized) |
| June 1902 to bottom in 1932 | -43.28% (-1.87% annualized) | -65.88% (-3.52% annualized) | 75.62% (1.89% annualized) |

1965 has a slightly better price return and a slightly worse total return, but you would never get the impression. And the returns from 1929 to 1959 are really not *that* bad: average returns over 30 year periods from 1871 to present are 6.64% annualized. For the 1902 crowd, holding for a few more years would help a bit but that price hit at the end really hurts."

There are far too many people who are employed and still not able to pay rent/mortgage, go on vacations, eat out, buy clothes- you know, the things they need to be able to do in order to participate in a capitalistic economy. 

The markets never waivered during the pandemic, despite the world coming to a halt for months. Just kept going up. That's how we know the market isn't based on reality. They can pretend that they live in Sunshine and Rainbowland while the rest of us claw at each other for scraps, but they're not immune from reality.

2021-06-05 16:40:10,wallstreetbets,"Worldwars lead to a greater share of women in manufacturing processes. They keep contributing afterwards to the gross domestic product. Collective bloodshed leads governments to share the benefits of returning to ""normal"" production after a war effort. And then there was the threat of communism lurking all over the world just after both worldwars, which incited pay offs for the working class.

For most economies national revenue is heavily dependent on income growth and domestic demand. Economies that forget that income from labour is the main driver for wealth and tax labour instead of capital, usually get corrected in the end depending on the amount of inequality their population is willing to take.

People tend to forget this every now and then, and mainstream media are not going to remind them.

Basically it's up to you. I'm afraid that at some point people probably have got to get up from behind their computer and actually do something.

Bullshit, problems don’t just magically disappear just because you stole someone else’s money and redistribute it. We don’t know what the repercussions are since nothing like that has ever happened in history. No period in history where there was ever equality, there never will be, because it’s an unfair world.

2021-06-05 12:02:26,wallstreetbets,"You missed his point then. Yes, Warren sucks at tech. The point is change over time and the low probability of predicting it.

When you look at companies today and say ""those aren't going anywhere"" it shows that we always think that as humans, and we are generally wrong. 

In simpler terms, pay attention to the numbers and data, not the semantic variables. 

Even if you *feel* that this idea does not apply to you because your ego won't allow you to accept that idea or be open to it. The fact is most people will get it wrong. Greater than 60-70%. People are wrong, often. 

Seems like common sense to me. You can't really argue that point either. There's no logical ""most people are right about predictions most of the time"" cpinterpoint. Especially over long time periods. Chaos theory.

Remember, pointing to people who do accurately predict is not the rule, they are the exception. Basic statistics. Everyone wants to think they're the exception and not the rule, and you have a subreddit of 8 million people who all *think* or *feel* like they are the exception despite their real world results conveying an entirely different reality they deny anyway."

>This post is about long timeframes.  Not month to month.  As such I disagree with your disagree. 

I am talking about long time frames as well.  The idea that measuring the value of the dollar against gold is somehow MORE relevant than measuring it against a value of actual everyday goods we buy (at least insofar as inflation is concerned) is just silly.

If a new, super rich gold vein were discovered today, it'd shock the price of gold downward.   But shampoo will cost the same.


>And “precious metals are worthless”. 4000 years of history says gold and silver are money.  Not sure what you are trying to say.

Perhaps ""worthless"" was a bit of a stretch, but all you have to do is look at the price performance of precious metals over, say, 30 years or so compared to just about any other class of security and you'll see exactly how much the markets value it.

2021-06-05 13:49:39,wallstreetbets,"I agree with a lot of what you are saying.  New rich gold vane would shift the supply.  Similarly as industrialization takes place the price of eggs, bread, cloths, cars, and anything that can be mass produced in a factory, comes down. 

The original topic I commented on was inflation measured via our government.  I think your comment of basket of goods would be a better measure than our governments constantly changing basket of goods.  Replacing steak with hotdogs in the measured basket immediately distorts the measurement.  Excluding the price of houses is another intentional distortion by our gov.  

It would be interesting to see CPI vs Gold vs S&P.   Which do you think would track S&P better on decades long time frame."

If Monday is a green day (which I think it will be because of European corporate tax deal) we will see a 10% Or So run up on Monday. Tuesday they report pre market and will crush numbers. I guarantee it as a Texan that shops there. They sell guns and ammo, so you can't directly compare them to dicks. Overhead is much lower too.

I just went to bass pro to buy ammo because of a friends tip they were stocking shelves. By the time I got there, huge line. It's like this at academy too.

Now you have summer with people going outdoors. Austin airport is requiring people to show up 4 hours early because of the TSA wait. The summer play is going to be hot AF and academy is at the forefront. Texans shop at academy. It's a bonefide pure hold for the next year for another 300% gain from here.

It's already looking like the Fed won't taper off based off that jobs report. This is a perfect storm for retail like ASO"

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Risk Reversals - Advanced Option Strategy #Alright retards let's learn about Risk Reversals

Risk Reversals are about paying very little to make a bullish bet. 

Here's an example using Silvers August Chain:

####SELL $SLV $23.5P, +.51

####SELL $SLV $28C, +.88

####BUY $SLV $26C, -1.44

#Net cost: .05, .03-.07 BidAsk

That means you spend **$.05 ($5)** for a **$26/$28** Debit Spread (SLV is currently $25.91). 

Max Payout is **40:1**. 

Note: This trade requires collateral. If you're using a shit broker like RH, that's 100% of max loss (AKA $2350 Per Spread), and if you're using TOS/IBKR/A real broker, it's going to be around 20% (~$470).

Worst-case scenario is that Silver plummets below $23.50 by the expiration, the stock is put to you, and you are forced to purchase the stock at $23.50. 

Truthfully idgaf about Silver/SLV, but this is a useful strategy for those of you who want to step up your game and make a very bullish bet with a very high potential payout.

(Trade courtesy of CNBCs Options Action)

#Edit: Y'all don't get it. 

#####""Why is this preferable to just writing a put, just buying a call, or just buying a spread.""

While it is capping your profit to the upside, you pay less than 4% of the cost you would for the same 26C on it's own, and less 9% of the cost you would pay for 26/28C debit spread on it's own.

#####""You could lose your collateral""

Your collateral is protected to the downside all the way to 23.5, which has been a strong point of resistance for SLV since August. That is why that put strike was chosen. Furthermore, a risk reversal is a **bullish bet**. If you are bullish on the ticker at 26, you will be bullish on the ticker at 23.5. And Again, TOS/IBKR/Real brokers will allow you to sell puts on something stable like SLV with ~20% collateral rather than Robinhood's 100%.

#####""You're capping your upside""

Though the upside is capped, there's nearly no actual cost to run the trade assuming no black swan events take place. This trade reaches break even at 26.05. The same straight call with uncapped profit reaches b/e at 27.44- and SLV would need to reach $83.5 to offer the same 40:1 profitability of the risk reversal above.

#####Why Silver?

Looking at the direction of fed monetary policy, inflation, and CPI numbers, Silver is in a bullish position to test its 52wk high of $28, which is why that call strike was chosen. And together, those two unlikely OTM options finance the purchase of an ATM $26. If SLV stays at 26, the trade profits from time decay on the OTM options. If SLV rises, the 52wk high is a plausible candidate for new resistance, and the trade achieves 40x profit. If SLV falls to 23.51, you lose $5. If SLV falls **more than** 10%, and only then, you are put the shares at $23.50 which is a safe, low price given the charts and economic policy, and also an extremely **unlikely** move. 
 
And again, this is important:

#idgaf about Silver. 

The entire point here is raising awareness to an interesting trade set up that reduces your risk and amplifies your gains which can be applied to **any ticker** and is used commonly by professionals in the industry. It's not an all-the-time every-time trade by any means, it's just another powerful tool any serious options trader can add to their playbook."
2021-06-04 23:43:41,wallstreetbets,aka financing a call spread by selling a naked put
2021-06-04 23:38:34,wallstreetbets,"So let's think about downside.  Silver drops to $22 and the max profit of $200 per contract turns into a $150 per contract loss unless you are bag holding until it gets back to $23.55 and then you are even.

Wouldn't it be easier just to sell a Bull Credit Put Spread to start with? Or sell a Credit Put Spread and use that to buy your call so your upside isn't capped. You would need to sell it on a blood red day."

2021-06-04 23:41:03,wallstreetbets,"Honestly you might not have a bad idea. Usually I’d lean towards a condor approach on commodities, but with the degree of chip shortages there’s an abundance of demand for silver. 

Quick exit and negate losses early on if the market tilts. If you’re still onboard re-enter positions leveraged towards recovery. 

Know you didn’t post it specifically about SLV but it’s a solid opportunity where this strategy could pay out.

2021-06-05 02:38:32,wallstreetbets,"

Quick note on the short interest numbers today. Ortex reported a net decrease in borrowed shares of about 29M, which caused some concern that the shorts may be covering more than we thought without seeing the corresponding price action we were expecting. 

However, Ortex tracks borrowed shares that are returned. Not necessarily borrowed shares that were sold short, bought back, and then returned.

Ihor Dusabiwsky with S3 Parnters has his own proprietary tracking system, and they do track actual shorted shares returned. According to their data, there was a net return of 1.4M shorted shares this week (1.6% of the total 88.2M shares currently sold short). 

This means that hedge funds only actually covered 1.4M short shares this week, and decided to return another 27.6M shares that they had borrowed but not yet sold short (likely because they finally realized what a terrible idea it is to short AMC). 

So let’s do some math. Short sellers covered 1.6% of their short position this week, and the share price went up 83%. If you assume the same rate of price increase for each percentage point of short interest covered going forward, then shorts fully covering their position would correspond to a percentage increase of 5,188% over today’s $47.91 closing price. That equals $2,485.60 per share.

And perhaps most importantly, these calculations only account for the covering of LEGAL shorts that are publicly reported to outlets such as Ortex and S3. There are many theories out there on how many illegal/naked/synthetic shares there may be, but the general consensus (backed by some extremely solid DD) is that there are a significant amount, many times more than the number of legal shorts. 

You do the math. This thing is far from over."

It is beyond corrupt it is pure evil and the Tsunami is coming soon, a Tidal wave that will be felt for decades. The damage is irreversable and it IS a war against retail investors and families, it dilutes value in stocks and companies. It is financial terrorism on an epic massive scale, robbing not only Billions of dollars from people but hope fairness and any resemblance of equality. How many have been destroyed by this? How many technologies and companies have been bankrupted? Prison is too good for these devils. We know AMC had over 3.2 million investors back in early May with a conservative estimate average of 500 shares each. Thats 1.6 BILLION shares not including new mass influx of shareholders and shareholders from outside the US.   There are only 500million authentic shares authorized. This is so extremely devestating.

2021-06-05 13:07:13,wallstreetbets,"Everyone here thinking naked short selling is illegal is retarded. Citadel already admitted to it during the congressional hearing and said they’d stop if there was a law against it, which means there is not. 

There is an SEC rule that kind of outlines against that apes like to cite but it’s not enforced nor explicitly says anything like “setting up short positions without collateral is illegal.” 

But it’s more of a naughty word that those who practice it, know they should keep quiet lest the law will change to prevent it. Honestly, if you have a lot of capital, it’s actually a great way to carve out more gains but at a potential unlimited risk factor. Predatory short selling with the intent of killing a company’s stock value should be prevented however."
2021-06-05 13:31:54,wallstreetbets,"Key move to squeeze shorts - DO NOT LET YOUR BROKER LEND YOUR SHARES.

Only way to do that is to put in a sell order - so put in a limit sell order at 1000.

If your shares are offered for sale at any price, they can't be lent, shorts can't deliver, shorts must purchase in the open market.

This is not financial advice - simply a solution to an interesting logic problem."

If they take no action, the conversation dies so fast it’ll be history by the time the same panel rolls out on Monday. 

Her naming the practice isn’t legally damning for Citadel. It’s an easy bridge to say, “we know such things happen, and that’s the name for it, but we’d never participate.”"

You're goddamned right it's dangerous, because your statement is wrong, bitch.

You said: ""There are a lot of short sellers out there who have been borrowing stock they didn't have.""

That's not what's happening. What is actually happening? ""There are a lot of short sellers out there who have been **SELLING stock they didn't have and didn't borrow.""** That's **blatant fucking fraud.**

It is us versus them. And yes. It is dangerous.

>Seems like a super dumb trade off.

Yes, it's very dumb. These hedge fund shitheads are dumb as FUCK. No smarter than me, you, or any other wsb dumbass. This is pure uncut greed through and through. They're naked shorting because they can. They have and will profit from businesses and lives being destroyed and they have gotten filthy rich off of that shit."
2021-06-05 09:08:00,wallstreetbets,"The only risk in naked short selling is the SEC forcing you to deliver. As the SEC is as corrupt as it is inept, this rarely ever happens."
2021-06-05 09:13:15,wallstreetbets,"If you can always wait out your short position or get bailed out, there's no such thing as risk. What they've done is create a one way money siphon"
2021-06-05 10:20:40,wallstreetbets,"Because shorting isn't illegal.    
The definition of shorting is selling shares owned by someone else which you borrow.    
If they're owned by you, you are selling to close shares you own. you aren't shorting.    
What should be illegal is shorting to manipulate prices.   
Tesla and Elon came out and said people shorting his company made business extremely difficult.     
They were a growth company and needed borrowed cash to function.    
Their price was artificially lowered so it made them seem over leveraged and extremely risky to lend money to which could have caused them to need to declare bankruptcy.    
It also made them have to issue stock at extremely undervalued prices.     
      
Shorters nearly caused Tesla, an innovative american company not to exist.    
Yet those same companies invest in Chinese companies like nio, xpev etc...    
    
I have no issue with companies shorting but doing so when they are artificially lowering prices and fear mongering shouldn't be legal."
2021-06-05 16:43:34,wallstreetbets,"If I understand correctly, short selling actively drives the price of a stock down since you are selling at below market value, whereas buying a put does not. Making people think a stock is tanking and they need to close their position is part of the strategy. I'd imagine they also buy puts as part of this strategy."

2021-06-05 00:02:54,wallstreetbets,Naked shorts ... they are borrowing shares. They get caught on the wrong side and they’ll shut down your broker app again. The SEC will take your finra license and JPow will write them a check to cover their losses.
2021-06-05 00:06:23,wallstreetbets,Yeaaaaahhhhh duuuuuude we should like totally short some stocks or something man. That would be raaaaaad.

2021-06-05 00:38:40,wallstreetbets,Oh. So since the hedge funds were naked shorting they have to buy shares to cover their asses which will make the stock go up. Is that what you’re saying?

2021-06-05 02:31:25,wallstreetbets,Found 1 of 2 people. Either a hedge-fund intern or some dude that fell for it. I don’t even think BB is worth anything long term. They’re going into EV TRYING to get out of a rut. Just cos they’re doing something doesn’t mean they’re doing it right. Hell they even plan on releasing a new android with that stupid keyboard they won’t move on from. Alrdy shows me how stubborn they are.

only gme is in the middle of reinventing their business, going through a digital transformation and actually fundamentally is changing their outlook. AMC will be a cinema stock in 5 years time. Koss will be whothefuckknows stock in 5 years time. BBBY will be a speciality retailer in 5 years time. 

BB will be a cybersecurity company, but the b2b market is capped.

Regular shorting they borrow the stocks from someone, right?"

2021-06-05 07:53:23,wallstreetbets,This would explain the constant replenishment of borrowable shares on ibkr and the low borrow fee even when there are none available
2021-06-05 09:29:06,wallstreetbets,Sounds to me a lot like selling shares that don't exist aka synthetic shares which aren't included in short interest data because they are hard to track.  Its definitely very possible that the apes nailed it on their DD here and these dumbfucks have been caught pants down cheeks spread wide for the deep deep dicking they are about to get.
2021-06-05 12:26:13,wallstreetbets,Pfft she's probably in on it as well lol

2021-06-05 07:52:42,wallstreetbets,Only GME mate. All other stocks shorts can easily be covered since they were not over 100%
2021-06-05 03:18:41,wallstreetbets,"Being a target for over shorting is one thing, but to follow the same pattern as GME indicates it is likely somewhat related to it. I would have to think that the degree of % gains between stocks would be indicative of which stock is the cause and which ones are the symptoms."

2021-06-05 02:28:56,wallstreetbets,Doesn't sound like it
2021-06-05 03:15:18,wallstreetbets,"I guess they're both symptoms of GME. The company with a massive turnaround that coincided with the time it was discovered to be ridiculously over shorted,  chilling at 3500-5500% gains YTD, while shorts obviously haven't covered. Still looks like they might enjoy some of the ride though. Whoever it is that's holding those stocks."

>Naked shorting is the illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. Ordinarily, traders must borrow a stock or determine that it can be borrowed before they sell it short. So naked shorting refers to short pressure on a stock that may be larger than the tradable shares in the market.

>Despite being made illegal after the 2008–09 financial crisis, naked shorting continues to happen because of loopholes in rules and discrepancies between paper and electronic trading systems.

2021-06-05 09:04:56,wallstreetbets,No not at all. CNBC is the entire reason any of us know or are invested in GME. They said naked shorting first so they're the catalyst. CNBC to blame for manipulating retail traders into riches!
2021-06-05 11:51:39,wallstreetbets,You didn't. Mr rightup who you responded to refered to illegal short selling

2021-06-05 13:18:32,wallstreetbets,"This article and post is literally about “naked shorts, yeah” yeah. 

First off, I own both gme and amc but have been heavily invested in amc since March. 

Now what’s gme reinventing their business have to do with anything. They literally HAVE to change because the previous one was failing. That’s the reason WHY it was so heavily shorted, silly ape. GME and AMC are a short squeeze play, not a fundamental business blah blah.

AMC is the biggest cinema in the world. They are currently expanding. AMC revenue has nearly doubled since Silverback Adam Aron took over 6 years ago. Movie theatres will lost revenue to streaming yes, but they will not die. Hollywood is directly connected to movie theatres. You don’t know what’s going on behind the scenes. Top directors, actors and agents were pissed that hbo made a deal during the pandemic to go straight to streaming. They have since canceled that deal for next year as pressure from the above forced them to. Silly cat. AMC simply has to keep doing what it’s been doing. Shorts bleed nasty while we chillin with GAINS. 

You’re wrong that gme is the only way to kill shortsellers. You’re TRYING (it’s not working) to divide us when actually AMC and GME apes are brothers. We are fighting the same fight. The good fight. 

I’ll see you on the front lines, my slightly more retarded ape brother."

2021-06-05 00:32:49,wallstreetbets,"I think the answer you’re looking for, or the one I think is correct, is that the MSM is verboten from even hinting at the fact that this is going on because it is, in fact, illegal. The next step in this madness will be certain HFs complaining to upper management at CNBC at the “unfounded assertion” but management will have their hands tied. If she has to go on air to explain that she misspoke or is just relaying what she’s heard, that’ll be free fucking advertising for all these subreddits and more people will come to know what’s going on and either get interested or complain to their representatives and create pressure against the short selling activity. If CNBC terminates her, she’ll likely go public and say the same thing but it’ll have even more credibility because she got fired over it. IMO the best thing they can do is ignore it and hope it wasn’t picked up on by their viewers (good luck with that)."

When AMC went up, I'm sure a lot a lot come from the FOMO, and existing stakeholders buying more and more, I feel like with GME we don't have that luxury anymore. If I speak for myself, I see everyone saying they're doubling down after good news, shit I already spent every single ""responsible"" penny I have on this, and I assume there's a lot of people who can't buy more, and even if your.

Out of the blue I got a DM from a WSB mod a while back regarding a thread similar to this one, explaining how they were just trolling the GME folks. Shits hilarious."

2021-06-05 00:53:16,wallstreetbets,"Good lord! If that’s the case then that means about 97.5million shares need to be bought. If that’s true then they would have to be bought at the current price right? That would shoot the stock price waaaaaay beyond the moon, I’m assuming well over $100 a share right?"
2021-06-05 01:12:30,wallstreetbets,I imagine illegal shorts not being covered would be a lawsuit waiting to happen on a scale that would basically Thanos the companies out of existence.

2021-06-05 18:23:45,wallstreetbets,More people per capita have a sentimental attachment to AMC than GME because movie theaters are collectively cherished whereas Gamestop was only cherished by male millenials and younger who played videogames growing up. Also AMC through youtube analysis channels and stock mascots was able to bring in a ton of people from the general public into the fold. A lot of first time investors with little experience got into AMC since the price was so much more affordable as well.

2021-06-05 04:13:56,wallstreetbets,I sold a lot of tools and I saw what was returned more often due to failure and over use. I saw what sold and stayed sold. I received plenty of feedback from various professionals in different industries that utilized all levels of the tools I sold. Ryobi is around the house weekend work level. If you're gonna use it to its fullest extent day in day out it wont last as long as a Makita or Milwaukee.
2021-06-05 03:08:28,wallstreetbets,Or if they all decide to cover all at once or spread it out for days/weeks.
2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Can I get an explanation of the short term play that everyone is going on about for BB I asked this in the weekend disc but didn't get any solid explanations. So, as a long term growth stock I can understand since it's moving towards being a software company. What I am not understanding is the **short term** play that everyone is trying to get in on and am misunderstanding something?

If the stock was shorted at 10% of the float (55m) as of yesterday and saw the premarket jump from 15.25 to 20.04 with 30mil of volume then drops to 16.4 with no resistance, wouldn't that indicate whoever short sold prior to 6/3 likely covered in the premarket?As the price has been steadily dropping through out the week, wouldn't new short positions indicated by daily short ratio increasing likely transitory and also likely to have been covering within the high volume as it trends down throughout the day?The short borrow fee rate is currently at 0.41% which means if a short seller didn't cover within the past few days, couldn't they just wait it out as it costs so little?Some one mentioned in the other thread that it could gamma squeeze but looking at the OI for next week, the open interest from $13 and 18.50 strike is only 4.6m shares which makes up like 1% of the float.  
Edit: formatted so easier to read  
Edit 2: 15 hours in and the only short play (why do people keep commenting about the long play) that's been described (minus the stuff not supported by any data) is hype buying.  
Edit 3: Someone posted a fintel link saying it's shorted at 24% but that's *daily short volume ratio which is completely different*."

2021-06-05 00:02:32,wallstreetbets,"I'm in it for a few reasons, I think the company has potential for the future and is limited heavily by its existing image as an antiquated cell phone company. 

With it being likely undervalued and a large amount of hype around it, I am happy to ride the hype up. I don't think this is going to be a short squeeze though. My PT is $20 for a stable holding price. It may peak higher but I think it can reasonable start hovering around $20 and I am happy to make that money."

2021-06-04 21:40:47,wallstreetbets,When AMC goes up meme stocks go up. That’s the play. They even created an ETF called FOMO b/c this phenomenon is real. Can’t take the heat……BB to the moon 🚀

2021-06-04 21:29:19,wallstreetbets,"Imo it's simply a momentum stock. It gets- and has gotten mentioned with AMC, GME, & NOK frequently for quite some time. It's not heavily shorted, but it seems to have a decent retail fan base."

2021-06-04 21:49:15,wallstreetbets,"It's momentum/sentiment. Next quarters earnings are still a ways off, and there's no real reason to expect them to be great. A one time sale of patents could be in there, which will artificially raise numbers, but it's unsustainable long term.

2021-06-04 23:32:16,wallstreetbets,$BB to the moon 📈🔥📈🔥 This is the way
2021-06-05 01:13:49,wallstreetbets,"I don't know what's going on. But I miss the ol BB keyboard phones..... So I bought $25,000 in calls today just in case it pops."
2021-06-05 02:50:11,wallstreetbets,"My honest opinion, as a shareholder (180), the hype can be traced back to June 2, when it opened 10% above it's close.  Before that time, I had 50 shares, but I saw what looked to be short term momentum.  I bought some dips looking to hit my target of $30 several months early.  

When apes say ""moon"", I don't know what that actually means.  $1000/share, 1000% gain, idk.  I don't think half of them know what it means either.  FFS they don't know that rockets do not go straight up, but none of that shit actually matters.  What matters are your own reasons.

I bought BB for stable growth in a company that I considered to be a steady mover with long potential.  Since I am kinda new, I pussied out of buying long calls and bought shares.  When that shit got to $20, I thought I might hit my 3X goal on my money 12 months early.  I'm not selling, in fact, I bought more.  As for a squeeze?  Da fuck should I know?"
2021-06-04 21:51:04,wallstreetbets,"Certainly felt like a gamma squeeze on Wednesday, but I tend to think you're right.  Shorts covered Thursday morning and left a mountain of bagholders. Great distraction from other plays.  

I myself missed a 2200% options play because I thought today would be even bigger."
2021-06-05 02:31:48,wallstreetbets,TLDR. So do I buy or not?
2021-06-04 21:52:18,wallstreetbets,"You are definitely not dumb money LOL.
I have been trying to find the same answers for two weeks now. I bought in at 10 just because I knew the price would follow AMC because people buy the hype and how much it’s talked about on here, instead of doing their own research they buy from popularity.
Hence the rise and fall with AMC."
2021-06-04 21:37:46,wallstreetbets,So you pretty much still haven’t got your answer😂
2021-06-05 00:01:41,wallstreetbets,"Not a rocket scientist but if the shorts already exited, there would be no reason for us to experience a short attack today. Those were not natural price movements. They haven’t exited shit but they can manipulate how short interest appears to us using synthetic longs."
2021-06-04 21:34:52,wallstreetbets,TLDR but I am selling covered calls on it
2021-06-04 21:41:49,wallstreetbets,"Honestly i think there wasnt enough shorts to trigger a bit short sqeeze but with hype and momentum and fundamentals there is a nice shot of getting a gamma squeeze i think, also as short interest wasnt that high i would bet with high prices it would have doubled by now, my retardness makes me believe the fact that stock didnt rise high with the extraordinary amount of volume we experienced on thursday wasnt provoked only by paperhanded apes but i suspect it was a prime opportunity for shorting the stock. Im playing by fundamentals here so cant explain the squeeze part but im pretty sure by now we got a bigger short interest than we did before the moves.

Either way the question you are asking means you still have at least 2 braincells working on your brain so good for you, maybe someone can correct me and show us the DD but i think the momentum was due to meme stock hype and bcause we feel company is way undervalued moreso than a squeeze but who knows we may have gotten on the uprising the short float we lacked"
2021-06-04 21:24:35,wallstreetbets,Hold. 🦍 Make warm fire 🔥 in meantime.
2021-06-04 21:35:45,wallstreetbets,"I got in because i liked the chart,  Before last week,  so any short squeeze , cyber security gigs for blackberry or millions of people that just wanna hold the stock and breaks the all time high is more than ok with me"

Happens every time a stock takes off, some stock takes off and someone looks for a similar stock that is cheaper and cheaper for a reason, NIO takes off and someone brings up SOLO. This sub has some amazing DD and market power. But their are retards who only bring up shit to help themselves."

It has been mentioned here for years because of ""potential"" while never living up to said potential and having shitty revenue from products for a decade. But now financials, products and future outlook don't matter for WSB. What matters is short interest, momentum and vague DD. I personally believe BB was undervalued before and at current prices is fairly valued here. But I don't think jumping in if it hits $20+ again would be wise."

2021-06-05 18:29:48,wallstreetbets,"u//mtw132 -

Read some of your posts. This one you have posted a few times. If one were a cynic one might suggest you are not as in the dark as you suggest, and perhaps your aim is to sow doubt into why BB has investment merit ? At least near term. Evidenced by how and what you write you do not lack intelligence ? So why ask such a question when doing proper DD would answer your question. There is plenty of very good information on Reddit. There is endless publicly available DD material. Listen to any one of the Investment Conferences BB has attended in the past few months (including another one this coming week).

BTW what in your book is long term ? A few days ? A few weeks ? A few months ? A few quarters ? A year ?

One could write a full report to answer your question but why, when you could just do your own homework (don't mean to be impolite).

Nevertheless here is a sampling of why, including in the very short term, BB is a compelling 'play'.

There is an abundance of comments where senior management is telling us all is on track. Including very recently. We are '*executing*' as planned states one. The response from auto manufactures has been '*overwhelming*' states another. There are dozens and dozens of pretty clear similar signals. Go to Blackberry's investor section of their corporate website. Listen and watch a few of the presentations. Pretty hard to be any clearer. Some things they aren't going to say more starkly at this point for competitive reasons. Nevertheless the message is clear.

Tom E stated '*without taking market'* share revenues will be 2-3X current levels BUT in addition he added they *'will take market share*' (so assume 2-3x current levels as the base case and very likely more). The market size is doubling plus. Every indication is Blackberry's products are the best out there and certainly not inferior to any competitor. Some, like CRWD, are being valued at 50X sales or close to 10X as much as BB. If one can look beyond a quarter or so of the financials, Blackberry is FAR more interesting and offers FAR more potential. AND you can buy it a large discount to others.

Anyone focused on the next quarter or two (like pretty much all the main street financial analysts) is missing the point. One does not buy BB for the next quarter. And the numbers don't have to be on the books to know they are coming. Think of MSFT when 10 years ago it invested $246 million into FB for a tiny stake. That investment valued FB at $15 billion or $300 per user when FB had NO revenues and a user base of 50 million (QNX has a user base of 175 million). Yet that investment today is worth $20 billion or 75x more. $300 per user on QNX equals $52 billion or about $100 per share. Again, unlike BB, FB had zero revenues at the time. Sure they are different but in this respect not that much.

In terms of the short term play several major items could dramatically impact the share price. Overdue already are details of the FB settlement. The impact of those details will not be minor. Also, specifics concerning the sale of the patent business, which the company announced several months ago is in the 'final stages'. These could drop at any time.

IVY's announcement, a company game changer, came as a complete surprise to the market on December 1st. Who is to say we won't have another surprise.

**Blackberry is NOT 'moving towards being a software company' as you write**.

It already is a software company with 98% plus of revenues coming from software. And so many seemingly well educated and well informed keep talking about shrinking or falling sales BUT if one isolates the software sales, those have been growing at a healthy pace. From the $200 million range in 2014 to the $1 billion range in 2020.

The silver lining is that when I hear people who are intelligent and seemingly in-the-know, largely oblivious of the most basic things about Blackberry today and basically superficially aware, it reinforces the notion that the market is still largely in the dark (when it comes to what Blackberry is now and what a future it has).

**This = serious share price upside.**

If we fairly compare BB to others, there is no question it should trade in a worst case scenario (baring a stock market crash) in the $25-$50 USD range right now. This explains why the large German insurance / asset manager company Allianz recently bought close to 5% of the company for about 1/4 of a billion dollars.

The naysayers try to suggest execution risk or still too early and need to see that next $ of revenue growth. Who is kidding who ? Chen has pulled off a near miracle. As per above (with hands tied behind the back) there was serious software revenue growth.

And does anyone in their right mind really believe AWS/BB partnered 50/50 on IVY, with the top Amazon people keen and having worked on project for 2 plus years alongside of BB, does anyone really think they aren't going to be able to execute (listen to videos - 'we are executing according to plan' + 'the usage cases are endless' and so on).

Real DD will make it clear to anyone that BB is grossly undervalued, including those interested in the short term play."

2021-06-05 02:31:07,wallstreetbets,"I am going to get downvoted into oblivion, but here it goes

I think that the short term play has ended by now, peaked at 20 who had to cover already did it, in my opinion

Nothing changed concerning the company to boost the price from the 8-10 range to 20 in this short time, this bump was related ro thia meme stock craze

Wait some days the price will go to that range before ER, buy and then wait. I have a prive target of 15 until  EOY, anything above that without a catalyst is a sell for me and a rebuy when it lowers

What we are seeing right now on WSB is January all over again, FOMO post's

Take profits and rebuy!

2021-06-05 09:19:56,wallstreetbets,"Personally in the long-term it could be a good option, cyber-security is a good field for employment so why wouldn't it be a good stock to invest in? In the short term they have an event this Wednesday (albeit late at night) that should drum up some interest, plus anything can really happen with enough interest to get more groups buying. If we get extended media coverage, that could definitely help the cause."

2021-06-05 09:37:17,wallstreetbets,Clne is the only real short term play. 13 before 6/18 should run the price pretty high due to call volume at the strike going itm. And it can actually be moved by retail fairly easy. Other than that there's nothing really driving it except for fomo on being the next huge stock surge.

I bought a few shares just in case --- but I don't think you can make a solid argument for going big in either direction for this stock. There are other stocks that are very clearly overvalued if you want to do fundamental trading. There are stocks with clearer trends if you are a trend follower.

And I get that there is a lot of positive potential for BB in the future but anyone not trying to ride the hype knows that a sub 10.00 stock price isn’t unreasonable. BB doesn’t have the healthiest track record and so they really needs to deliver in the coming quarters if they wanna keep the stock price moving upwards. If Ivy bombs then I’d say that’ll be all she wrote for BB.

2021-06-05 02:42:12,wallstreetbets,"Per your fintel link, that's short volume ratio not the short interest of % float. Short volume ratio is the amount of short selling done within a single day divided by the volume for the day. That would mean 7% of the total float was shorted this past day. The daily short volume ratio also doesn't account for the amount of short positions that were opened and closed within a single day, you would have to scroll down to the daily short section to see how many people still had their short positions open but I don't have a fintel subscription.

My thoughts are, couldn't the recent spike in short be positions opened near the $20 mark which may have caused the dip down to $16 and covered within the following days as its been steadily oscillating to $13 between the high amount of volume?"
2021-06-05 10:43:24,wallstreetbets,This is true.
2021-06-05 06:32:09,wallstreetbets,"https://fintel.io/ss/us/bb

2021-06-05 07:17:48,wallstreetbets,Right. I personally think the market is sniffing out synthetic/credit swap shorts not fully represented by short interest figures and bb apes are just channeling that spirit.

It was a stock of interest way before gme was a thing and always had positive sentiment.  It’s a great long play that people aren’t going to want to miss out on.  Just because it’s a long play doesn’t mean it can’t moon in the short term either.  Plenty of companies that were supposedly long plays just went ahead and mooned.  The short interest isn’t as high as gme or amc but it doesn’t mean there still can’t be a short squeeze.  It’s all about demand and how much the shorts are willing to lose.  From the way it looks, short interest has risen more the past couple days. I noticed something very strange in the bb threads that weren’t in the amc or gme threads, which were bots trying to encourage others to short bb.  It’s a weird thing to push in this sub and makes me wonder if anyone actually falls for it, but I would imagine they convince people on here to short it at the lower price it is now before they rug pull and cover."

2021-06-05 08:15:09,wallstreetbets,"It's easy to be mooned because of the market cap size.  If apes want to moon companies, picking companies with total market caps of 5B-10B are right where you want them.   Thats what makes it easy to push around.  That's it, that's all it is. Its small enough to move.  Can't do this shit with AAPL or NVDA, etc..   Apes buy up the float because it's cheap, and they can, and price moons.  Apes buy up the float and buy metric tons of ATM and slightly OTM options and now you got a squeeze brewing.  MMs have to hedge their options positions.  If they can't find people selling, they hedge with ""virtual shares"" they create on their books because they have the ability (and permission) to create liquidity.  Then FTDs start spiking cause an unusual number of shares are held in MM hedge positions.  Then, more memes because of FTDs...and you got a cycle brewing.

2021-06-05 12:18:22,wallstreetbets,"Im still a noob at trading and still evaluating how retarded i am but i would advise you when in doubt jerk off and then put in order your feelings towards the stock in question; in my case when i began trading in january i was looking at charts non stop and felt pretty nervous the whole day, i realized thats not a way of living so i thought what would let me be carefree of the movements and then i came to the conclusion i needed to go into plays that i would feel good either going up or down; in my case i love my plays going up so i can cash some money but i also love my plays going down so i can average down and double my investment; from there before i invest i ask myself if i like current price and then if i would average down without remorse, if the answer is yes put some take profits limits on part of your trades and keep living your own life and learning new things. For example im trapped at huya already doubled my position multiple times and looking to double a third time if it goes close to 10 only time will tell if im retarded or not but at least im able to sleep like a baby knowing my initial theory on the stock still stands."

2021-06-05 14:39:32,wallstreetbets,That very well could have been the case but I also think it was market makers trying to pin the price below $14. Looking at the open interest and call volume for 6/4 they definitely tried to manipulate the price down and close it below $14 to let everything higher expire worthless. My thoughts are they have their short positions still open or they are under hedged at this point. If volume opens up strong on Monday they will have to close their shorts or buy shares to stay hedged for the amount of call buying that will occur. Will see what happens on Monday but either way this has been fun to watch.

2021-06-04 22:53:05,wallstreetbets,"I mean shorting a stock is a legitimate strategy if you believe the share price is higher than what it should be but yes technically if a stock has any short interest it can be squeezed, the magnitude of it will vary. What I don't get is how there is a short squeeze play since the borrow fee at the moment is 0.4% so there isn't much pressure to cover, per my other comment to another user.

*So I don't have the estimated short % at the end of today. I did look on fintel and saw that the short volume ratio for the day is 20% but couldn't that be positions opened near the $20 mark and covered within the day as its been steadily dropping to $13? With the gamma squeeze angle, wouldn't there have to be a significant amount of open interest going up the options chain in the next week? From the post, I tallied that the total OI from $13-$18.5 strike only accounts for only 0.8% of the total float*"
2021-06-05 11:47:59,wallstreetbets,"Recently there's been this irrational trend permeating in wsb where stocks with long term prospects are suddenly degraded into meme stocks because of short term spikes.

In reality, if you think that the intrinsic value of a stock is well WELL higher than the current price, then the spike is actually the market being rational. I mean, think about it this way, if you suddenly sell because of the spike even though the value should be even higher, you're basically saying ""nah, this can't be it. the market is supposed to dumber than that. they should've taken 5+ more years to figure out the value of BB so i'm selling it now even though I think it's worth more"""
2021-06-04 23:07:59,wallstreetbets,I had to make a new account because of the spam I was getting on my old one. Feel free to look at my history to see I’m not a bot.  You don’t seem to care that amc was a distraction from gme but now you are gonna knock on bb.  Bb was a play long discussed before gme became a thing.  The real bots in the bb threads are trash talking bb and trying to convince people to short it.  The accounts created anywhere between Jan 27 through February 2021 are the real accounts to be wary of.
2021-06-05 12:39:16,wallstreetbets,AMC has no reason for going up but short selling. GME is the only real play 😂😴
2021-06-05 02:37:47,wallstreetbets,"It's number of existing shares that have been shorted. When a short is placed the stock goes down, when a short is covered the price goes up (buying it back). When people short they do it on margin, if we all buy a stock and it spikes, those people have to buy the stock at whatever price it is (no matter the price). The idea is to buy up so many of the available shares that the shorters need to pay a ridiculous price to cover, which drives to stock to bazunga price levels. Basically the higher the short interest % the more likely a small spike turns into a huge spike. And anything over 20% is a lot of short interest."
2021-06-05 03:00:53,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to point out that 24% short figure is actually short volume ratio which is different. Short volume ratio is the number of sales sold short for the day divided by total number of trades for the day. In this case, there was a short volume of 41M shares sold short out the 174M shares traded today which is how a short volume of 23.69 is reached. That does not necessarily mean the stock has a 24% short interest. Because it's the daily short volume ratio, a person can open a short position and close it within the same day, that would increase the short volume without increasing the short interest because the trade cycle had already completed. The short interest would be the final amount of shares that were sold and not yet covered which could include previous days.  
The total float (total amount of shares that can be traded) of BB is 566M shares, so only 174M shares out of the 566M exchanged hands today. If you took today's short sell ratio as the final short interest, then it would be closer to a short interest of 7% but of course people can still have open short positions from previous days so the figure could be different."
2021-06-05 09:20:45,wallstreetbets,Ill fucking starve to death before I sell a single share with no tendies.
2021-06-05 02:46:36,wallstreetbets,"Anything is possible, I was just pointing out that just 10 institutions already own a majority of the shares and the float is actually quite high so retail investors would have to buy *a lot* of shares to move the price."
2021-06-05 09:52:11,wallstreetbets,Agreed 📈🔥 Ape just jump

2021-06-04 23:37:24,wallstreetbets,"The borrow fee does help apply pressure but not totally necessary.  Demand for bb has built up this past week which led to some covering but only to be shorted again.  If demand stays strong and people don’t panic sell, all it takes is a big boy short to cover to cause a ripple effect of covering for a squeeze.  I believe the short term play is very very possible and it would be nice to see, but I am definitely fine if it’s a gradual movement upward.  CNBC and Cramer low key shit talk bb since January.  That’s enough for me to know they want this suppressed and once it gains traction, it’s off to the races."
2021-06-05 12:43:04,wallstreetbets,GME paved the way but as far as it’s potential to make money I have no interest in investing in GME.
2021-06-05 02:43:57,wallstreetbets,Thank you appreciate it!
2021-06-05 08:22:38,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but at current price, this gives BB a market cap of about $8B.  This is fairly easy to push around.  Retail could probably fairly easily come up with $5B to buy half the float if apes keep buying.

I don't think institutions will dump on retail with BB like they did with AMC.  I imagine a good chunk of the institutional held float will be tied up for quite some time as BB has fairly promising long term potential."
2021-06-05 05:52:49,wallstreetbets,"Right, so we need to buy a lot. Good DD man! I'm going all in!"
2021-06-05 10:54:06,wallstreetbets,"Who says only retail is trading or investing? Also the point about having to buy a bunch of shares to move the price doesn’t really mean anything because if you look at the past few weeks the price has nearly doubled...Because people ARE buying a lot of shares - insane volume last week, although some (maybe most, who knows?) of that was probably covering."
2021-06-05 06:16:58,wallstreetbets,The short term play is mostly based on three bullish RSI triggers in the past 2 days.

2021-06-05 00:06:29,wallstreetbets,"If the borrow rate stays low, whomever shorted can just continue paying the interest since it's a minimal cost. It would end up being a battle between who folds first, retail investors or short sellers.  What I'm saying is that the short ratio between the past two days may have been opened and closed within the same day as the price as the price fell which is a prime opportunity to get an exit. Without an official short % out, you would have to bet that short sellers haven't already repurchased the shares when the price ocilated downwards from $20 to $13."
2021-06-05 12:45:20,wallstreetbets,No it paved the way for EVERYTHING that is going on right now. Not saying you should. Just stating the facts that it’s the one true play
2021-06-05 15:54:25,wallstreetbets,U guy r confusing me. Make it simple.  Buy or no?
2021-06-05 01:15:45,wallstreetbets,*bbw
2021-06-05 00:48:33,wallstreetbets,"That’s true. That would have been a lot of panic selling if so. What is also true is that there are way more retail investors that are prepared to hold this long who bought this past week and many more who are going to buy the dip in preparation of holding long if needed.  When Amc squeeze is over, there will be major bag holders. I don’t care how much you love movies, I love movies too, but they are gonna have to start charging $30 for a bag of popcorn to justify the current valuation.  There is a fair chance with gme as well unless ryan Cohen works his magic.  I’m actually interested and looking forward to hearing the plan he has laid out for the company.  I’m not shit talking either one before anyone gets hostile with me.  I think both will still continue to squeeze but at some point there will be a peak and a very good chance of a sudden drop off that leaves bag holders.  People say bb isn’t the same as gme and amc, which is true.  It isn’t as heavily shorted. It still has potential for a squeeze though. People are buying in for the hyped up short play but know darn well there is a long play involved as well.  No need to worry about being a bag holder in the long term.  Perhaps this is why short interest hasn’t been as high in bb as the other meme stocks.  Like I said, cyber security and ev market are 2 hot markets now.  Bb is at the top of their game for both.  Most people think they are still a phone company. That’s the first thing most people think if you mention bb to them. Even people I know who are into tech think that first, but the recent events is bringing light to many people that they are much more. John Chen is gonna lead bb to greatness and is pretty focused on doing so, which is maybe why he isn’t throwing out conveniently timed memes to hype up the stock.  I wouldn’t mind if he did though. Lol.  On a side note, Bb had so many partnerships and deals the last few months.  At some point when they had around 5 partnerships/deals, Cramer had the nerve to say to stay away from bb as the Amazon partnership is not enough for him to want to buy it. We know exactly what to do when Cramer says something"

Today I have more pretty graphs to share, some with lines, some with pie.

First things first....

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5loevtyybc371.jpg?width=570&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72e59b116dc7d6c83f528b8de9d7ad00ecb55163

It was a red day, todays change was -0.22% bringing the overall down to 19.49% 

&#x200B;

[The reason SPY looks weird is b\/c I wasn't about to go back all through the daily changes of spy for the last three months](https://preview.redd.it/sxkhfpf6ec371.jpg?width=4051&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb62abc42b080191179eef261d2b3b5209750fa0)

I added SPY to show how they preform against each other, as time goes on the SPY line will start to look more interesting. Even though it was a red day it wasn't that drastic of a change.

&#x200B;

Also with calculated compounding interest, if you started with $1000 (on april-5) you would have $1205.57 at closing today. 

&#x200B;

Now I know we've had a few red days in row, so I did a little work and made a pie chart representing the ratio of green, red, and days off. 

&#x200B;

As time goes on I'll calculate the weight of the percentages to the marbles and we'll have more cool charts to look at. 

That wraps things up for the week, I hope everyone has a good weekend filled with tendies. I'll see you for marbles Sunday at 6pm central

 

Best of luck to all who wish to partake, and as always..... this isn't financial advice.

Since it was red, have some banana pudding...

Quick note on the short interest numbers today. Ortex reported a net decrease in borrowed shares of about 29M, which caused some concern that the shorts may be covering more than we thought without seeing the corresponding price action we were expecting. 

However, Ortex tracks borrowed shares that are returned. Not necessarily borrowed shares that were sold short, bought back, and then returned.

Ihor Dusabiwsky with S3 Parnters has his own proprietary tracking system, and they do track actual shorted shares returned. According to their data, there was a net return of 1.4M shorted shares this week (1.6% of the total 88.2M shares currently sold short). 

This means that hedge funds only actually covered 1.4M short shares this week, and decided to return another 27.6M shares that they had borrowed but not yet sold short (likely because they finally realized what a terrible idea it is to short AMC). 

So let’s do some math. Short sellers covered 1.6% of their short position this week, and the share price went up 83%. If you assume the same rate of price increase for each percentage point of short interest covered going forward, then shorts fully covering their position would correspond to a percentage increase of 5,188% over today’s $47.91 closing price. That equals $2,485.60 per share.

And perhaps most importantly, these calculations only account for the covering of LEGAL shorts that are publicly reported to outlets such as Ortex and S3. There are many theories out there on how many illegal/naked/synthetic shares there may be, but the general consensus (backed by some extremely solid DD) is that there are a significant amount, many times more than the number of legal shorts. 

You do the math. This thing is far from over."

2021-06-05 18:28:10,wallstreetbets,"Dude. Where y’all get 80 grand to fucking flick into a meme? The other day I “dumped” $250 into amc at 44 while I was getting my tires changed on my used Mitsubishi montero and it jumped to $67 and I made enough to cover my poor people expenses. I feel like it’s counter productive and downvote me to the shadow realm. But if you have 80,000 to fling into the nether are you really sticking it to the hedge funds or just showing off how bad you don’t have it? Idk I hope you fucking quadruple it though."

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Investing in Somalian Pirates (You can try this at home) # TL;DR

Followed a meme about investing in Pirates and actually found out a way to

meme for reference:

&#x200B;

[I was intrigued.](https://preview.redd.it/6ir32qg7cc371.png?width=522&format=png&auto=webp&s=e169e9176a77b082068e12a2bdbeae91567ef781)

So like any true autist I knew I had to find a way to throw my money at this. Everyone laughed at me and told me to eat rocks. Everyone fuckin laughed. Until now:

# Part 1: DD

&#x200B;

[Pirate attacks per year are at an ALL TIME LOW.](https://preview.redd.it/btzzb4qncc371.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cc1bb02a4c4daf006350c0c235c052dc94a461c)

I instantly realized after seeing this that big business and the government don't consider pirates real threats anymore. There are cargo ships parked all over the damn place just waiting for a pirate with the RPG I bought him to take. This was my first confirmation bias. Which is why I knew I had to find a way to buy in.

I then turned to the only place I knew that could help me find out more about how to invest in the next Benjamin Hornigold:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u4xewo0kcc371.png?width=296&format=png&auto=webp&s=fad1d5fbaa6ca2099a6d50937bfbc01ba806dcb7

It didn't work. However, after a few more days of digging around googling autistic keywords, I found it:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j1s27bfgcc371.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce27a12461fd6e8263a54401e0a629de4988afec

&#x200B;

[Found my Hornigold](https://preview.redd.it/aopgdopecc371.png?width=372&format=png&auto=webp&s=f70c98f6e552c9a81de03ae10b5485669988aa1b)

**Bingo.**

Disclaimer before I go any further: You might be thinking to yourself, ""wow what a prick. Who would invest and give guns to people who you pretty much know are going to use them on other humans? What kind of sick person would do such a thing?""

To that I say 1) fuck off and 2) this is **GOOD FOR THE ENVIROMENT:**

So - with the ethics/DD taken care of, I began my Journey to find a way to get some pirates invested in.

# Part 2: Actually finding the pirate stonk exchange

Not gonna lie - this was a pain in the ass. Turns out, the only way to actually invest in pirates is to give them the money/guns physically. My Wendy's check didn't give me enough for an air plane ticket and to invest so instead I decided to just buy the RPGs and send em out to them.

I got in contact with a guy who called himself '3 leg' off a site im pretty sure I cant post on here and sent him an email asking if they had any stock I could buy in their pirate crew (and how many shares I would get for sending over an RPG).

&#x200B;

[I made sure to translate it into somali too.](https://preview.redd.it/avrh9es0dc371.png?width=1315&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1fb8cd5800eb0d5c1e74bee8e67ee67b63504d0)

After some time he got back to me:

So, I bought 3 RPG-7's from places unknown and sent them off to Jowlo Road.

It has currently been about 5 months now since I sent the original 3 RPG's. The only contact I have received from 3 leg was some weird email in Somali:

# Part 3: Current Day

So here we are, almost 6 months down the line - no money left in my bank account and no word from 3 leg. I'm starting to think something might have happened to them while they were out at sea and am worried. 3 leg, from what I knew, was a pretty stand up guy. He replied fast to my emails and was quick to send me an address. It makes me think the RPG's might not have been enough. I am saving up currently to make a trip out to Hardaheere (the town he lives in) to make sure they are okay and to hopefully find the tendieman too. Will report back if I make any headway.

The difference I see is that the pirates are destitute and have little to no options for economic growth while in america the options are endless and yet raytheon and boeing choose to make weapons that end up in pirates hands.

Id wager that most pirates dont actually want to hurt their hostages, they just want money.  Raytheon NEEDS people to kill with their weapons to prove how effective they are so other people will buy them.  Thats the difference I see."

Having seen some crazy shit happen from this sub I unfortunately believed it was capable of going down this path. Also, knowing a little about how the Somalian pirate thing works got to me. They dont kill them more often than not but that’s not really an accurate representation either. I know ppl who’ve been kidnapped so...I’m not defending Raytheon, I find the idea of military defense deplorable General Dynamic, Haliburton, Raytheon etc. But I also understand there is a pragmatic difference that can’t be typed out in a Reddit sub."

2021-06-05 00:07:00,wallstreetbets,"I can empathize with the pirates but I certainly dont sympathize with them. The pirates end game isnt death, its money.  Death can be a byproduct of their job.  Dead people dont get ransoms paid.  Raytheons end game is death cause it helps them sell more death machines.  Genuine question:  which is worse, the madman with a gun or the guy that keeps selling guns to madmen?"

This is great"
2021-06-05 01:46:03,wallstreetbets,"Well, i empathize not emphasize lol.  I can understand their desperation.  They have have no options.  When you have no options youll do desperate things too.  If my kid is starving, I would rob or steal to feed them if there werent options and in Somalia im going to guess that there arent a lot of opportunities. I can understand how they got pushed to that point.  Raytheon is doing it oiut of pure greed and capitalism.  There are plenty of options for them.

The point is that if the pirates had other opportunities then they wouldnt be pirates.  Killing people is a ""bug"" in their system while with raytheon killing is the feature.  I dont think you get the point.  Lol"
2021-06-05 02:08:13,wallstreetbets,You clearly don’t understand either example at all so I’m done wasting my time. There are plenty of ppl who live in dire situations that don’t choose to cause harm to their OWN community for their own benefit. El Salvadoran gangs come to mind as a good parallel to the pirates. They cause countless ppl to immigrate to escape their violence. Read before type dumb shit. I’m done here. This isn’t FB so I don’t want to continue and engage in pointless conversation with uninformed ppl self-convinced of their position. You’re right Somalian pirates are in the morally righteous position. 👍
2021-06-05 02:29:47,wallstreetbets,"Damn you were too dumb to realize that this post was a joke to begin with so I can see how you cant empathize with people in desperate situations. I never said they are morally righteous.  Why put words in my mouth?  Your argument of raytheon only sells weapons has big ""i only put them on the train, I didnt gas them"" energy.   Actions have consequences and raytheons kill count is way higher than any pirates.  You cant seem to grasp that people acting criminally out of desperation is not as bad as a state sanctioned weapons corporation that death is what they sell.  You are very smart."

Oil is going up on a two year high $70 a barrel and it’s gonna keep going. We are burning up that bubbling crude baby, opec has approved production increases for July. Invest now and get to Hootin and hollerin about gains on Americas birthday. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE FROM A SMART PERSON. I’m a working class dude who’s seeing 10-20% gains already from buy in about a month ago.. so instead of sinking all your $$ into the meme stocks after they’re played out so you can post the loss porn.... maybe throw a little into the ones that are going to go up this summer as demand increases.

2021-06-04 21:43:20,wallstreetbets,"Oil and gas are 
in play, you would be a fool to ignore it.  There will be 90 dollar oil this summer because of the sideways pressure from the impending gas delivery shortage that's being warned about right now no matter what OPEC does. On top of that it's way harder to convince people to go electric at $1.79 gas, they'd rather have cheap gas while the whole mother fucker burns, so the us administration is GOING to manipulate the market towards upwards price pressure, look around they already are. People usually only change when they're forced to. I just see the trends and act accordingly, I'm here to make money. This is the market, morals need not apply. Ask the bag holders about crusades and they'll tell you what they think about that. The absolute beauty of WSB though is the new way.

2021-06-04 20:38:42,wallstreetbets,Thanks bro I’ll check that shit out. I’m digging Putin’s sweet Russian oil also
2021-06-04 23:56:31,wallstreetbets,"Congrats bro. Long time coming. Good things come to those who wait. Was getting dicey there , thesis is playing out now ! 🚀"
2021-06-05 07:57:05,wallstreetbets,PAA to the moon
2021-06-04 22:30:07,wallstreetbets,"I hold BP, COP, CVX and EPD. I got in early in the year and they have all done great. Think BP has more to give than the others near term. OP has LUKOL which to me still seems reasonably valued, I’m just nervous about Russian stocks. I regret not pulling the buy trigger on ET as well as the ridiculously high dividend IOC.NS. Unless something else comes up I like more, I now plan to let them all do their thing with a trailing stop %. None of this is advice of course, just sharing my own thoughts. Keen to hear what others think."
2021-06-05 07:43:41,wallstreetbets,Try looking a PAA pipelines. Breaking out now going to 25-30 levels

2021-06-04 20:32:11,wallstreetbets,More production more sales I guess is my reasoning

2021-06-04 22:26:21,wallstreetbets,The Dividends are fun too
2021-06-04 21:13:20,wallstreetbets,"I love REI, for many reasons. The others I’ll hold through the summer prob not long term"
2021-06-05 04:03:23,wallstreetbets,"Oil just broke through a bearish trendline going back to 2008 highs when it was at $150 barrel and recently broke through highs of 2019.

I study oil futures daily and the trend is fucking bullish now, the best in a decade. We'll be at $70/barrel next week and $75 not long after.

Most oil companies are profitable at $30 - $40/barrel so they're printing money in this environment.

People are asleep on this sector and that's fine. They'll realize in a few months they completely missed a massive bull market."
2021-06-04 20:32:43,wallstreetbets,Do you feel better?
2021-06-05 08:39:41,wallstreetbets,Come fly with me and PAA
2021-06-04 22:20:13,wallstreetbets,I use all of my back and a little of my brain
2021-06-04 22:49:12,wallstreetbets,Yoy bastards! ( South park reference)
2021-06-04 21:12:17,wallstreetbets,Really just joking - there has been a fair amount of misdirection I’ve seen with all the “meme” stock craze. Trying to pull money out of GME. Not a GME fanboy but there has been some weird things happening.
2021-06-04 22:26:08,wallstreetbets,Go for it - she’s a wild one!! I’m off at 8am so you have time 😆
2021-06-05 07:58:34,wallstreetbets,PAA is also in play with other oil names. Currently breaking out of a Cup and Handle trend line
2021-06-05 08:38:29,wallstreetbets,Completely agree. I’ve got 80 calls expiring in august at the $12 strike. I bought them for .10 each share. Now they are at .45. Would love to see that fly.
2021-06-05 01:50:15,wallstreetbets,"No. Supply and demand. When Saudi and Russia increase oil production, the price of oil goes down. Now, the summer demand will likely still offset the production increase, but in general, when Saudi says they’re increasing production its bad. Like really bad."
2021-06-04 20:40:33,wallstreetbets,Yep
2021-06-04 21:13:04,wallstreetbets,Misdirection in which way?
2021-06-05 03:29:22,wallstreetbets,No joking about Citadel in this sub apparently.
2021-06-05 09:05:30,wallstreetbets,"Trend line looks like a classic Cup and Handle trend line formation, currently at the jumping off point for higher levels"
2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I’m a bit retarded. OFf to buy BB shares instead 🔙🔛➖ 
2021-06-04 20:25:54,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I've tried to follow the rule of ""don't buy options with less than three weeks"" and ""sell options when they hit a week"". Whenever I deviate from this, it screws me."
2021-06-04 20:29:38,wallstreetbets,Congrats retard. At least you have the remaining .77% to spend it on a nice family dinner at Wendy’s
2021-06-04 23:33:40,wallstreetbets,$BB to the moon 📈🔥📈🔥 This is the way
2021-06-04 21:33:11,wallstreetbets,"$BB sleep well 🦍 s
May you dream of 🍌 s"
2021-06-04 20:29:12,wallstreetbets,"i'm thinking about $20.00 call exp july 2nd .

if  we retards continue to push it i don't see why it wouldn't ..

im not suggesting here or telling anyone to follow .

its only MY!! opinion"
2021-06-04 20:21:14,wallstreetbets,"Let me guess. 

Mistake 1: FOMO’D 
Mistake 2: “Dang let me look at the previous all time high, surely this will run up again before expiration and hit or go above that!”
Mistake 3: “Let me go all in” 
Mistake 4: “Let me buy options when volatility is already high so I can over pay on premium!” 
Mistake 5: “Let me buy a call in a huge ramp up, what goes up must go up!”
Mistake 6: “Let me not look at theta decay on this 1DTE Call, my stock price surely will not stay at the same price or crash”"
2021-06-04 20:15:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I feel this pain"
2021-06-04 20:19:28,wallstreetbets,"To many paperhands for me in it right now, but I’m keeping an eye on it... was $40k deep at one point. Also in AMC ✌️"
2021-06-05 03:41:20,wallstreetbets,Bought 2800 more shares. I like the stonk
2021-06-04 20:41:25,wallstreetbets,I feel some pan too
2021-06-04 21:35:01,wallstreetbets,BB to the moon... Go BB go...
2021-06-05 07:58:09,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry next week 25$
2021-06-04 20:39:31,wallstreetbets,Brighter days ahead.  There will always be a little bit of turbulence on the way up.
2021-06-04 21:05:44,wallstreetbets,Surely your furthest possible OTM 0DTE FD could not possibly go tits up.
2021-06-04 21:47:55,wallstreetbets,"If it makes you feel any better, I lost 8k to options over a 2 month span. It did not feel good at all... and actually still doesn’t feel too great. Wife doesn’t know about that one. Although I’m down $1500 today, I deposited $4000 last week and was +$7500 at one point yesterday (now only +$4500). Basically, if you make the right moves, you can make your money back. Go balls deep in AMC ASAP and get on this rocket ship to the fkn moon. It’s coming. Or at least it better be coming because I’m 8k deep in the MFr right now. Lol good luck to everybody and remember to HOLD until the big day!"
2021-06-04 20:29:11,wallstreetbets,Options. Child. Go to bed.
2021-06-04 21:14:03,wallstreetbets,"So you bought the $25 calls I sold. I was wondering who  made me 2k in a day. Honestly though, I was hoping it would hit so I could have a clean exit."
2021-06-04 20:20:14,wallstreetbets,Should’ve had your exp date further out so you can hold like good 🦍 and make 🔥 in meantime
2021-06-04 20:28:28,wallstreetbets,You prolly coulda sold these to some retard before closed for a buck a contract
2021-06-04 20:33:35,wallstreetbets,Weren't they supposed to go to the moon?
2021-06-04 21:24:15,wallstreetbets,Just bought 300 more bb today. We get the volume it goes up. Simple. What we waiting on?
2021-06-04 22:41:36,wallstreetbets,I'll pray for you
2021-06-04 23:20:26,wallstreetbets,Long calls are the way
2021-06-04 23:26:57,wallstreetbets,Shares is the way always.
2021-06-04 23:55:57,wallstreetbets,God why did you do this...definitely deserve the result of being greedy.
2021-06-05 00:33:19,wallstreetbets,At no point you thought a grand or two was better than nothing?
2021-06-05 04:46:30,wallstreetbets,"I see you're new here ... Does anyone have a solid DD post filled with possibilities of honest extrapolation? No?

Then it's fomo"
2021-06-05 12:00:01,wallstreetbets,Stop buying options. Buy all the shares.
2021-06-04 20:13:08,wallstreetbets,"No loss, just hold"
2021-06-04 20:19:46,wallstreetbets,Ouchie!
2021-06-05 02:00:27,wallstreetbets,Lost 360 dollars on wkhs yesterday
2021-06-05 10:42:36,wallstreetbets,I’m in the same boat just not as retarded
2021-06-05 13:43:41,wallstreetbets,Tuff
2021-06-04 20:47:17,wallstreetbets,BB is completely trash and am shocked how many genuinely smart retards even think of gambling even a penny on them
2021-06-04 21:18:47,wallstreetbets,"My general rule of thumb if I'm buying any option is at least 60 days. Then sell between 30-45 days before time decay really sinks in. So far it's worked out. I also hedge by selling calls at a closer expiration. Profit is profit in my book, even if I miss out on a rocket."
2021-06-04 20:42:01,wallstreetbets,I keep telling myself to do that but then I go retarded and don’t
2021-06-05 00:50:02,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂😂
2021-06-05 02:00:05,wallstreetbets,Lmaoooo
2021-06-04 20:52:34,wallstreetbets,I’ll hold for your tendies
2021-06-04 21:15:42,wallstreetbets,I'll be selling calls again come Monday. You're welcome to buy them.
2021-06-04 21:15:40,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t theta decay it pretty gruesomely? Never bought calls longer than a week but I know the farther out the less the decay is
2021-06-04 21:21:37,wallstreetbets,"Mistake 7: I lost all my money and now my wife got a boyfriend, and he kicked me out of the house.

    Btw you still got 38$ I see. I c u bro. Go treat yourself to something nice at Wendy’s."
2021-06-04 21:26:35,wallstreetbets,"😂 don’t add insult to injury ,, this ape 🦍 is hurting … lets help in becoming him a retard/degenerate again … he’ll get it ."
2021-06-05 10:27:18,wallstreetbets,You might be a gambling addict
2021-06-04 21:18:31,wallstreetbets,"Congrats, now eat my ass"
2021-06-04 20:41:00,wallstreetbets,Could’ve but Id rather have the 100% loss to look at each time I think I’m smart
2021-06-04 20:35:16,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but they crashed into a asteroid"
2021-06-04 22:50:45,wallstreetbets,Fridays red.Mondays green.monke eat bananas. 🦍 💎 🙌🏻
2021-06-05 13:30:47,wallstreetbets,Yes but.... You get leverage on options. Just know the risks of what you are buying and remember that the premium affects breakeven.
2021-06-05 00:32:06,wallstreetbets,Yes sir that was 100% it. Sucks I ate away my entire years profit just like that but I learned the hard way. At least I’m not in jail I guess
2021-06-05 00:38:40,wallstreetbets,Idk man fuck it what’s done is done I’m just a retard
2021-06-04 20:14:33,wallstreetbets,You telling him to hold expired options. I'll take whatever you're high on.
2021-06-04 20:14:45,wallstreetbets,They expired 4 hours ago dumbass
2021-06-04 20:16:15,wallstreetbets,Why didn’t I think of that
2021-06-04 20:20:15,wallstreetbets,Hold what??? Hopes and dreams? 😂 expired!
2021-06-04 20:18:06,wallstreetbets,Even if you’re at a casino you should know the game you’re playing before you piss away all your wife’s boyfriends money.
2021-06-04 20:48:28,wallstreetbets,Your first mistake was calling me smart. Second was calling BB trash. Wait
2021-06-04 21:21:39,wallstreetbets,It honestly has great potential for a long term hold. I have been selling calls against my shares for a while now as it slowly went up. This quick rise was unexpected though.
2021-06-05 11:16:49,wallstreetbets,I just sell calls and hedge w shares. Simple and consistent albeit smaller profit
2021-06-04 20:50:28,wallstreetbets,"I did the same thing yesterday and bought 6/4 WKHS Calls and of course did not sell when I shot up 30% in 10 minutes despite having no faith in the stock. Let myself get greedy and I paid for it.

What I had to remind myself of a reality that starting $20,000 and having 7 100% days/weeks/whatever puts you over a million dollars. We get hooked on the idea of 5000% gains but truthfully they are incredibly rare and often are surrounded by 100% losses. From now on, once a holding hits 100% I'm out. Looking at the last year we've had easy opportunities to jump 100% at least monthly. If I make a 100% gain a month for the next 7 months I will be a millionaire just after the new year. Sounds like a good deal to me."
2021-06-04 20:54:01,wallstreetbets,Oh I’m holding shares too!! Absolutely and buying steadily 😁🚀
2021-06-04 21:21:35,wallstreetbets,Absolutely!! After all we retards 🦍 stick together …
2021-06-05 09:40:27,wallstreetbets,"I've been selling BB calls for a while now. It is collecting those little bananas. Sure, I want the huge ones for $0.4 / Lb but I am happy eating and not starving."
2021-06-04 21:22:48,wallstreetbets,It’s happens to the best of us … it’s an 🦍 thang!!
2021-06-04 21:26:08,wallstreetbets,Mistake 8: be a retard
2021-06-04 21:25:39,wallstreetbets,Nah I just let it expire so I’m keeping it 100.
2021-06-05 12:23:04,wallstreetbets,Could someone explain to me in DM about AMC and GME?   I’m trying to exchange cash for moon tickets
2021-06-05 17:23:40,wallstreetbets,"You realize what r/ you’re on, correct? Scared money don’t make money."
2021-06-04 21:26:33,wallstreetbets,No need to be rude man; The first part was a joke. That's why I mentioned hoping it would hit the $25 mark so we both win.
2021-06-04 21:53:14,wallstreetbets,"Dang, real talk. This is the way. Battle scars"
2021-06-04 20:37:43,wallstreetbets,damn OP that's Cold AF!!
2021-06-04 20:35:41,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂nice one
2021-06-05 00:40:50,wallstreetbets,"True, it's only money. But bad habit - adds up real fast and RH is the worst for friday day trades"
2021-06-04 20:30:11,wallstreetbets,lmfao![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
2021-06-04 20:22:03,wallstreetbets,It's not a loss until you sell. Can't sell if they're expired
2021-06-04 22:40:52,wallstreetbets,"That’s the spirit !! The 🦍 in you just woke ..
Stick with WSB and the force will be with you !!! 🚀🚀"
2021-06-04 20:51:37,wallstreetbets,I could eat your wife's bloody pussy while her boyfriend fucks my ass that doesn't mean you can call it dinner and cards against humanity
2021-06-05 11:18:39,wallstreetbets,"That is what I usually do as well, but sometimes specific stocks cost too much to do that with for me(Amazon). By doing it with options I can get close to the same results with a fraction of the investment."
2021-06-04 20:54:45,wallstreetbets,Same I had 10k AMC calls expiring today and when they shot up to at least make me get net zero yesterday I got greedy and ended up losing 10k alongside this 5k. At least I know I’m a fucking retard alongside you
2021-06-04 21:23:41,wallstreetbets,"In all honesty, I hope that each time I sell a call the buyer wins too. I get a garenteed gain, even if it is smaller, and the buyer goes to the moon. I just wanna be the guy selling fuel."
2021-06-05 09:42:22,wallstreetbets,Same here. I've been selling covered calls since I got in around 5ish.
2021-06-04 21:24:13,wallstreetbets,"Very informative, thanks!"
2021-06-04 21:36:36,wallstreetbets,That’s the price of education..happens to all of us
2021-06-05 18:24:40,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure what scared money is- but I do know about smart and dumb money.
2021-06-04 23:18:01,wallstreetbets,I wasn’t being rude. please eat my ass; I need a little spiritual healing to soothe my retarded soul
2021-06-05 00:42:17,wallstreetbets,Well I am now not buying option calls that end on the same week. Ever. That should help
2021-06-04 20:55:37,wallstreetbets,Bruh can you chill
2021-06-04 23:11:27,wallstreetbets,"Thats a lil more retarded bro. 

Jk everyone fucks up. Fuck money anyway."
2021-06-04 21:54:10,wallstreetbets,This! I only sell calls at a strike price where I’m okay letting go of the shares. That way everyone wins if it hits.
2021-06-05 18:26:08,wallstreetbets,Whatever brings my portfolio balance higher. I don’t care how it gets done.
2021-06-04 23:20:20,wallstreetbets,"Very well, I shall eat my heart out!"
2021-06-05 00:48:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, try shares out. LEAPS too but I can't recommend that with a stock like this right now. I'm sure premiums are bonkers. Get shares in waves if you have a long thesis. If you don't just day trade weeklys - sell when up. Hold overnight (if before Thursday/FD) when down and cut at 50%. Rinse and repeat ."
2021-06-04 20:59:44,wallstreetbets,of course honey bunny we're all little fonzies
2021-06-04 23:16:03,wallstreetbets,Exactly love you

If it finishes below the strike price he'll lose everything.  If it finishes $1 above his strike price then he'll earn $100 for each contract he holds.  He has 100 contacts so he'd make 10,000 profit at that price on 6/11 which is when the contract expires.  If it's $10 above that strike price then he'd make 100k profit.

I've seen a lot of people doing that on here and I'm always curious why people would go for the hardest-to-achieve price point...if they had $1,200 calls would you have bought those? $1,500? I mean, at what point does a risk/reward calculation come into play (unless you inherited your money you've clearly made good calls in the past)? At some point it becomes more a lottery ticket than a reasonably achievable price level, doesn't it?"

Given the short interest today (expected to be higher Monday), the Short sale restriction list, the massive amount of volume in last few days ( almost 200 million Thursday) , will the buying pressure lead to a considerable squeeze?


Black rock and other institutional investors have been increasing shares for the last couple of months. 

This has a relatively low float as compared to other successful shorts like AMC. Stocktwits watchers are growing like crazy. 

EV is having a big bull run this summer. And that’s not even mentioning all the political news . 

Tim Ryan, Ohio congressman made it clear he is fighting for workhorse and Ohio jobs! Dejoy is now being investigated. Congress still trying to halt USPS deal. 

The formula seems like it’s a surefire. What are everyone’s thoughts for Monday ? 

Can this horse become a stallion? I think 50% of the float wants to be bought up .
🐎 🚀 

Edit - they announced a production partnership with Morgan Olson’s subsidiary - who has built thousands of USPS trucks in the past. As they currently have 8600 back order

https://s3partners.com/

TLDR: Workhorse is the most shorted stock, can’t be shorted Monday , so buying pressure could turn this horse into a stallion, Apes."

2021-06-05 02:13:31,wallstreetbets,I’ve been long on this company since January.  You make a lot of good points including the USPS fiasco.  They only delivered 6 trucks part due to supply chain issues and part in a production snags ( a recipe for disaster).  They have made improvements since then.  They could have produce more vehicle but took the time to produce a better quality rather than increase the quantity.  A side note is a significant portion of the loss can be directly contributed to the write they did for the stake in $RIDE which is a no cash item.  They also have about $200 million of cash on hand. Since I opened my position in the company back in January I have averaged down many times since then. CP is ~900 @ 13.52. I’m not very good at including links in such but this can all be googled searched.

2021-06-04 22:53:56,wallstreetbets,They shorted it cause the stock suuucks
2021-06-04 21:09:17,wallstreetbets,I would only buy WKHS under $10-$12 you chimps. This is not like AMC and GME

2021-06-05 15:09:48,wallstreetbets,"Yo - WKHS absolutely ripped last year because of its addition to the Russell 2000 index.  $RIDE is getting added to the index this year (also Steve Burns company), and is about to fucking rip.  From now through July 2 we’re about to get on a rocket ship"
2021-06-04 20:54:43,wallstreetbets,Even better. Te more we hold the more the squeeze
2021-06-05 15:15:58,wallstreetbets,Hedge funds are not required to disclose short interest and would definitely not publish naked short interest
2021-06-04 20:28:51,wallstreetbets,I bought options for today and took it in the shorts. What more WSB kinda play do you want from me.
2021-06-05 03:09:08,wallstreetbets,"The trading volume has been significantly increasing and WSB, social media is aware of the high short interest.  The analyst downgrade today slowed down the price action.  Wkhs has a lot of upward price action coming."
2021-06-04 22:36:25,wallstreetbets,CLNE better set up (gamma)
2021-06-04 20:35:01,wallstreetbets,It doesn’t have the nostalgia value of the others. Otherwise a good buy.
2021-06-04 21:53:33,wallstreetbets,"There's a lot of due diligence on this company on this sub. It's because WKHS is a shit scam company that probably actually deserves to shut down. It definitely has short potential but the other companies at least if you're a bag holder, there's a potential that the price will eventually catch up to squeeze price. With WKHS, no possible way. There's actually a good reason this company is being shorted to oblivion."
2021-06-05 01:39:52,wallstreetbets,because wkhs doesn't have the letter AMC GME in it. Let's go leaps.

2021-06-05 15:08:02,wallstreetbets,Monday you better throw that cash into $RIDE.  Russell 2000 reconstitution day on June 25th and $RIDE is on the list.  Go look back at June 2020 price history for $WKHS when they were added to the Russell index
2021-06-05 09:37:19,wallstreetbets,Trojan horse?

This isn’t a matter of if, but when. If you look at their history, when the SI% increased and then eventually shares were returned, the price reflected on that nicely. And that’s without a squeeze. The gambler in me wants some July calls but I feel like maybe shares are the move now"

2021-06-05 08:59:57,wallstreetbets,Agreed.  This is already EXTREMELY over valued with 120 float.  No catalysts.
2021-06-05 04:52:49,wallstreetbets,"true, could be worse than WKHS"
2021-06-05 08:00:17,wallstreetbets,"I work in procurement, and POs are definitely not shit. For a vendor to receive a PO means that the funding behind the PO has been encumbered (secured), approved for payment by multiple parties on the paying side, and the vendor will receive payment for the product. Generally, at higher dollar values, a PO is issued after a contract is executed and at that point the contract would need to be nullified (unlikely, rarely happens - more often it’s a change order if anything, because you’d burn bridges with the vendor) to cancel a PO."
2021-06-05 15:10:29,wallstreetbets,The Lordstown play is going to 5x WKHS gains
2021-06-05 15:06:45,wallstreetbets,"Please shift to $RIDE, massive catalyst with the Russell index addition on June 25th.  If you like WKHS, you’ll remember when they were added to the Russell index last year and the price went from $2 to $20.  It’s $RIDE’s turn"
2021-06-05 09:43:06,wallstreetbets,I bet your all time returns are like -40%
2021-06-05 02:34:48,wallstreetbets,Where is this screenshot from? Source?
2021-06-04 21:48:24,wallstreetbets,There were big buys on an 18c for 6/4 and a 15c for 6/11. Methinks this stock is going to pop next week.
2021-06-04 21:14:59,wallstreetbets,Get shares for sure.
2021-06-05 04:34:31,wallstreetbets,Deep on shares mainly but purchased calls yesterday. Gamma level squeeze if we buy up the float.
2021-06-05 04:39:08,wallstreetbets,Check post link 50%. Short Volume =/= Short Interest
2021-06-04 23:41:25,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but what's more than likely to happen is that the retail will be bag holders vs. Actually fucking the hedge funds. Look at GME, I'm still holding the bag at high 380's and GME was shorted over 100%. GME has a chance to be a good company as they are planning to go digital or what not. Based on what I've read, WKHS likely has absolutely no potential at all.  And if that's the case, I'm sure it's more than hedge funds that are shorting WKHS, it is probably retail as well; because again this company should probably be bankrupt and stop defrauding its investors. Putting money in this is much riskier because people believe it's a sham company, and you'd basically be saving it to sham more people. And when all goes to shit, there will be a lot of bag holders with absolutely no potential to get anything back."

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NOK - Why it's gaining and being discussed. NOK is not a ""Meme"" stock yet, but it could be in the future.

TL;DR NOK is just a great stock with huge growth in it's near future. It's not a short squeeze.

The reason NOK is being discussed so much is because it's rising in price. People are saying there's nothing about NOK that's special, it's been trading flat between $4.00 -$5.00 for the longest time and that 5G is not new. Well, there is a lot of things that are going well for NOK that does need some attention.

NOK is currently undervalued. It's been trading stagnant between $4.00 - $5.00 for quite a while. They're the top leaders in 5G and telecommunications. They also control a large portion of the market share and have acquired more contracts than Ericsson. Ericsson is also another company that is doing well and should see continued growth as NOK but it's currently already trading around its fair value of $13.00. Huawei was a major competitor to both but that is no longer the case. As North America and many other countries across the globe have put sanctions on Huawei and China, tariffs, and claims of espionage, many countries are no longer doing business with Huawei or at least are moving away from them. That brings those clients to companies like NOK and Ericsson.

NOK is not a cell phone maker anymore. They have completely redefined their business model. They're a multinational telecommunications, information technology, and consumer electronics company, and have been for a while. They're projected for massive growth between 2021-2026 and that's from 5G alone. They're already the leader in 6G development and put heavy R&D into it. The business model goes 2021-2026 5G implementation, after that it develops into 6G production. 5G isn't as new as everyone thinks and the majority of the Globe is behind on it's implementation.

Adding that NOK is wanting to do share buy backs, possibility of a dividends being return, and overall growth, the future is looking great for NOK. They also killed their Q1 2021 earnings and are projected to be beating the market by 2023 in growth. People saying that it's history was trading flat also is another benefit as this stock will be a great hedge to inflation. Also, adding once this stock hits it's fair value, there will be more short interest that will develop from the price naturally. At that point, it could very well fall into a ""Meme"" stock category.

But right now, this is not a meme stock. The stock is being talked about and the price going up is not because of WSB, but because investors really want to invest long in NOK because of the company, sector, business, and price.

This stock is actually just a really good stock overall to invest in. It's not a short squeeze, but could develop into one possibly. It has accelerated growth in its future and people just like the stock, it's really that simple. Not all massive gains derive from short squeezes, just saying.

**Edit:** The mods took my original post above down for some reason but didn't advised as to why. I think it's because I didn't highlight how money can be made from it that meets with the standards of WSB, so I added the information below.

NOK is also in negotiations to do a 550M share buy back, which is 10% of the public float which will also increase their EPS.

Proposal of the Board of Directors:

[https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/02/04/proposals-of-the-board-of-directors-to-nokia-corporations-annual-general-meeting-2021/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2021/02/04/proposals-of-the-board-of-directors-to-nokia-corporations-annual-general-meeting-2021/)

Apart from NOKIA's expected growth over the next half a decade to a full decade cycle. The options contracts are dirt cheap at the moment. You can buy far out leaps for next to nothing. I hold both shares and options. My predictions, NOK hits $10 minimum EOY.

**Final Edit:** This post was just to clarify why the stock is moving upwards and that it's price is not going up because of WSB or any Short Squeeze Interest.

2021-06-04 23:10:59,wallstreetbets,I am with you. I think NOK is undervalued
2021-06-04 22:03:05,wallstreetbets,"NOK and BB are fantastic long term plays, BB has contracts with big names for software development. These got a ton of attention brought to them due to GME, and while they've been mostly side action since then they'll eventually erupt, these are long term plays that might get a nice bump from a series of gamma squeezes. The next 6 months will tell the tale, but they are fantastic plays if you want that Lambo!"

Also safer to buy shares. The options are expensive now and probably only work out for you if the gamma squeeze thesis comes to fruition. Shares likely to gain in the long term."

2021-06-05 10:10:50,wallstreetbets,But I think you are missing the fact that demand has increased exponentially and there's also people out there (def more than 100) that have 10+ gpus and are mining
2021-06-05 14:25:40,wallstreetbets,10-4
2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC target is $20 (don't hate the messenger). I have no DD to share. I care about price action only. Price action for me is now bearish.

1. Parabola broke today. That's a big problem imo. Parabolic advances tend to retrace 70-80% of the advance.
2. $44.80 is the 5MA on the daily chart and in after hours were now trading below that.
3. We've broken the support level at $46.50.

When the parabola broke today I did buy some puts on amc (at a ridiculous 500% IV) . So I do have a bias here. My target on AMC is $20-$24 area. I'm sure I'll get downvoted into oblivion but thought I would share my position and my reasoning behind it.

Peeps asking for proof of position. Here ya go. Positions opened yesterday when AMC cracked the parabola. Plan is to exit by Wednesday with around a 50% gain if all goes well. Depending on how it plays out I might open a long spot position on AMC at $20 next week. I don't hate AMC or anything just see an opportunity to profit on the way down and just as content to profit on the way back up.

2021-06-04 22:21:59,wallstreetbets,Positions?
2021-06-05 05:01:56,wallstreetbets,The tv lady said it's naked shorted on the stock news today. It's gonna boom now.
2021-06-05 03:22:10,wallstreetbets,"Quick note on the short interest numbers today. Ortex reported a net decrease in borrowed shares of about 29M, which caused some concern that the shorts may be covering more than we thought without seeing the corresponding price action we were expecting. 

However, Ortex tracks borrowed shares that are returned. Not necessarily borrowed shares that were sold short, bought back, and then returned.

Ihor Dusabiwsky with S3 Parnters has his own proprietary tracking system, and they do track actual shorted shares returned. According to their data, there was a net return of 1.4M shorted shares this week (1.6% of the total 88.2M shares currently sold short). 

This means that hedge funds only actually covered 1.4M short shares this week, and decided to return another 27.6M shares that they had borrowed but not yet sold short (likely because they finally realized what a terrible idea it is to short AMC). 

So let’s do some math. Short sellers covered 1.6% of their short position this week, and the share price went up 83%. If you assume the same rate of price increase for each percentage point of short interest covered going forward, then shorts fully covering their position would correspond to a percentage increase of 5,188% over today’s $47.91 closing price. That equals $2,485.60 per share.

And perhaps most importantly, these calculations only account for the covering of LEGAL shorts that are publicly reported to outlets such as Ortex and S3. There are many theories out there on how many illegal/naked/synthetic shares there may be, but the general consensus (backed by some extremely solid DD) is that there are a significant amount, many times more than the number of legal shorts. 

You do the math. This thing is far from over."

2021-06-04 22:24:47,wallstreetbets,I thought the same but couldn't pull the trigger on puts as the premiums turned me off. No way I'd short shares as I don't want to risk my face getting ripped off.

2021-06-05 02:13:03,wallstreetbets,I remember when all the 🌈 🐻 said GME was going back to $10 after the first squeeze.
2021-06-05 03:53:47,wallstreetbets,High trading is where it's at. If I'm gonna stare at price action and rainbow colored indicators all day you better believe imma be blazed for it. The numbers mason; WHAT DO THEY MEAN? ^im ^^gonna ^^^find ^^^^out.
2021-06-04 20:19:19,wallstreetbets,"That's because there is no explanation for stocks shorted to oblivion aka ""meme stocks"" the name used by the media to hide the short interest and the motive behind investors"
2021-06-05 04:38:09,wallstreetbets,"It's up cus AMC is still up technically.
Big money doing the same trades on both AMC and GME, which is why the price movements are super similar and happen at the same moments most of the time. Many different players are playing the game but it's all under control by the whales"

2021-06-05 01:53:56,wallstreetbets,These shorts were buying starting at $5 a share.  I am sure very few of the positions are in the money.  LOL. Plus you have all the synthetic shorts that are not supposed to fucking exist.
2021-06-05 04:24:04,wallstreetbets,"If they didn't want margin calls why set margin requirements at 150-300 percent, which they are doing."
2021-06-04 20:17:03,wallstreetbets,Yeah they've only lost 5.9 billion in 2 weeks on AMC alone? Super sustainable right? Investors are going to want a return pretty soon...
2021-06-04 21:56:09,wallstreetbets,Pretty soon you’re gonna start feeling the opposite! There’s no possible way amc is going back that low until after the squeeze 🤷🏻
2021-06-05 04:34:32,wallstreetbets,"These meme stocks have no traditional fundamentals to look at. Best indicator for these stocks is how hot is the hype. When the hype is hot, it has a higher chance of going up. When the hype cools off, that's a good indication of the top."

2021-06-05 18:04:03,wallstreetbets,You’re evaluating the Shinkansen like it’s a steam locomotive.  Good luck with that.
2021-06-05 04:45:25,wallstreetbets,"No it's definitely whales. Price spikes for GME and AMC are happening at the same time since they're selling/buying large amounts of both at the same time. If you look at the charts in real time, when I see two small quick spikes or dips during the day, I believe that's them making their moves. Sometimes it works and pushes the momentum in those directions but not all the time."
2021-06-04 21:17:53,wallstreetbets,"AMC and GME are nowhere near the same situation, other than all the retards buying. Way more are gonna get burned from AMC. Besides, GME actually has a future if the transformation is successful."

2021-06-04 20:37:32,wallstreetbets,"That number isn't even right. Those are unrealized gains just like you gain/losing money holding a stock.

https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/amc-short-seller-losses-stock-price-surge-8-day-rally-2021-6-1030491645

So is this week now only '$3.8 billion'? 

&#x200B;

And what about shorts that ended up covering during rally up and then re-shorted at new hights (e.g.: the crash from $75 say caused by shorts other day). If they re-shorted (or new shorts came in) at say $75, suddenly they got almost half their money back.

The 'lost billions' mean nothing as long as those numbers aren't realized.

Unrealized is unrealized for a reason. It's just bad journaling to bring in sentiment to readers."
2021-06-04 21:33:55,wallstreetbets,Boooooo!
2021-06-04 22:03:00,wallstreetbets,and if there is no squeeze? what then genius.
2021-06-05 04:49:58,wallstreetbets,"I don't believe so for GME. Selling video games on the digital market has huge competition in all fields. Console games have their own stores bundled with the console. Mobile games are dominated by Google and apple. PC games have their giant stores as well like steam, gog, epic etc, not to mention having to deal with piracy. They literally need to branch off to an entirely new market since they are basically too behind to catch up."
2021-06-04 20:15:04,wallstreetbets,"It's also not about whether the company even has proper fundamentals, it's about nailing the shorts."

I was trying to point out that there aren't any reputable sources using the term in that way."
2021-06-04 21:22:54,wallstreetbets,"You started the statement with “like just try”. That implies that I put no effort to get my information from anywhere else. People talk like this to others on Reddit all the time. This is the internet. It’s not like you’re behaving any differently than anyone else. Being behind a profile gives people the boldness to be as rude as they want to be. 

Not sure what the point of you trying to justify your comment here...I’m just another random person replying to a comment on WSB. It’s not that serious."
2021-06-04 21:31:04,wallstreetbets,"I think I see where the disagreement is. It wasn't meant to be a ""ugh, just *try* getting info from somewhere else"" kind of comment, it was supposed to be a ""like for example, try googling ..."" sort of statement

But try looking at it from my perspective from a second.

How would you have personally worded it?"
2021-06-04 21:36:28,wallstreetbets,The way you phrased your statement just now has less of a negative connotation. It sounds more like you’re attempting to teach the other person rather than deride them.
2021-06-04 22:16:04,wallstreetbets,"That's fair, when I wrote it I was mentally reading it in my head the second way.

My apologies for the confusion."
2021-06-05 04:28:52,wallstreetbets,Believing something to be true with no actual evidence is basically just a conspiracy theory. It's the rage these days
2021-06-05 08:15:48,wallstreetbets,"Just because something is a conspiracy theory doesn’t mean it’s not true. There are plenty of conspiracy theories that were later proven to be true once evidence was released/obtained.

Like I said in another reply this all one big bet. Let’s just wait and see who ends up on the winning side, alright?"
2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Degenerate Story Time (trials and tribulations of a retard) So since we’re rolling into the weekend I figured this would be a good time to learn a little about the journey some of us have been on the past year or so. I’m sure everyone has a unique personal story of their financial journey throughout this past year or so. I’d love to hear some of the fucking disasters you bulls/bears/apes have gotten yourself into as well as the successes. I’m sure mine is mildly entertaining compared to many but I’ll start us off. 

Originally started investing in 2019. I sold all of my positions before the Covid crash last spring (only trading stocks, was up over 100% on my portfolio in approx 6 months which I know is peanuts compared to the gains many have but I was proud of myself for just starting out and mostly swing trading boomer shit) which turned out to be an amazing decision except for the fact that I did not reinvest any of it during the massive March dip. Like many I was stuck in a whirlwind of uncertainty and did not know if society would ever return to normal. So I did the rational thing you would do with your gains. I spent it on drugs and alcohol, and paid off my car note so I could trade my Acura in for my dream car. I bought an Audi s8 which is a car I wanted since I was a teenager. It was fucking amazing, I couldn’t believe it was mine (the banks) and I got to drive that shit around every day. I swear to god I will hit 100mph every single time I got behind the wheel of that car. Even if it was just to run a couple miles up the road to the gas station. My car note was insane, between the payment and my insurance I was paying as much to have that car as I was for my rent each month. It took up a big portion of my disposable income so I stayed away from investing until about August of 2020. I took what was left in my savings account after all those bad decisions and decided once again to jump back into the market. The September tech stock crash pretty much wiped me out and I cut my losses and walked away with a fraction of the money I started with. The next month I crashed the shit out of my Audi. She had no chance with me as the owner. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise because guess what boys, I can now take all the money I was putting into my car (which was waaaaaay out of my league by the way) and invest it. I came up with a monthly budget and by Nov 2020 I was back in the trading game. I spent literally hours each day researching and learning as much as I could. I figured out my swing trading style, had a solid game plan going into each trade, and was making bank. Bank for me anyways. All through Nov and Dec I was making more money swing trading stocks each day than I do at my full time job. I felt like Warren fucking Buffet. 

*GME enters stage left

January. Mothering fucking January. Over the course of the couple months prior I had built up a nice little chunk of change for myself and had a portfolio to be proud of. This is when I decided to yolo on GME. Did I buy at $10 or $20, or even $30? No, of course fucking not. I started buying that shit in the $70s and before you knew it I had a triple digit average and had unrealized daily profit that exceeded what I make in a month at work. Oh, BB and AMC are squeezing this month too? Sure I’ll take some of those. Fast forward about a week and I’m selling at a loss and have less money than I had started with in November. I could have secured profits but no. A week of investing in GME had erased all of my fundamentals and made me abhor the color green apparently. Here I am five months later and I’ve barely clawed my way back to breaking even on the cash I initially invested. 

Did I swear off meme stocks after this cataclysmic failure of investing? You bet your ass I did. Did I try to swing trade GME again a couple weeks later with some fresh powder and lose even more money? You should know the answer to that at this point. Despite my constant tribulations did I once again buy AMC and BB this week? Of course I did you sexy animal. So here I stand before you today, a full on retard that barely learns from his mistakes. I’d love to hear some of y’all’s investing stories from the past year.  😘"
2021-06-04 22:32:31,wallstreetbets,"Quick and sweet, got in at the bottom of the crash and bought 18k in puts, THANKS VARIATION SEPERATE, diamond handed it to zero, doubled down, made 8k my first two days and of course""i got this shit down"", at September I'm down 55k, 25 of it low interest debt, made 20k off the September crash,  lost it all back, bought tesla fds on there inclusion run and then when down about 50k I made it ALL back with 5k on GME.  Learned me a lesson and have now only lost what I can afford to lose.   I'm switching over to a shares only broker once my other account goes big dick or kaput.  Fuck options they truly are lotto tickets and everyone seeing these easy 6 figure gains posts are being played for suckers.  Everyone's talking about much GME took from the market.. Pffffff.. what a joke..  GME has MADE the MM BILLIONS or more from every retard jumping on this stupid shit.  People are straight addicted and it's sad.   I'm down 19 I've all time right this instant but that's what I can afford to lose."
2021-06-04 22:52:41,wallstreetbets,"Jan: 
- Bought $GME at $360 per share. Sold for a loss. 
- Bought $BB at $26 per share. Sold for a loss.
- Bought $NOK at $6.5 per share. Sold for a loss. 
- Bought $AMC at $15. Held for no apparent reason.
- Swore no more momentum stocks.

This week: 
- Sold AMC at $30. Felt so happy I finally made profit. But...you know what happened.
- Bought close to $15k worth of BB contracts today."
2021-06-04 21:46:20,wallstreetbets,Hasty FDs and monthlies gambles without fundamentals is what screwed me
2021-06-05 00:55:12,wallstreetbets,"Great. I jumped into the market first time this January. Did basically the same shit you did. Doubled what I put in and that's when the dipshit hands set in. Saw it drip all the way back down sold for a loss, then lost more in the chop while gme mooned again. Then made some money trading spy options intraday, then lost those gains being stupid thinking I could predict the market. However pretty much back where I started trading gme again from 140. (With realized gains). Like this new meme season, hope it lasts longer than a couple weeks."
2021-06-04 20:45:16,wallstreetbets,Lol this would be me except E92 m3. Can I ask what question? To get an s8 how much capital did you begin with?
2021-06-05 02:29:59,wallstreetbets,Trials and Tribulations is a song by LCD Soundsystem. So.....buy more NOK.

2021-06-05 06:19:54,wallstreetbets,"I started investing in 2016. Only shares, lost money in 2015&16 but since then I've beaten the market by about 8%

The Covid crash happened and I didn't do anything other than buy a tiny bit of XON and DIS. I just mentally checked out of the market. I didn't sell anything.

I missed the entire 2021 run up but the most important thing was that I didn't sell. Now with gme and amc posts it gives me the Covid fomo regret. I don't have anything against meme stocks but they have to be backed by fundamentals 

Back in the day MU was a huge meme stock on wsb. Everyone was trying to play options on it. I just bought shares due to great fundamentals and still hold today at about +110%. r/stocks was obsessed with tgt back in 2017 when it was around $50, it's now $232 with dividends. 

It's difficult to avoid the noise and fomo but I'm not investing to get rich, I'm investing to get wealthy."
2021-06-04 22:43:31,wallstreetbets,"I bought a used one full transparency, after a few years they depreciate like crazy and you can literally get a six figure car for like half the price. I don’t have a super high paying job by any means but I have a long credit history (I was 30 when I got the car, 31 now. I got my first credit card and car note in my name when I was 18) and have had several cars on credit that I’ve paid off plus long credit histories with several companies. It was more about credit than down payment.  Plus I literally bought it the day before businesses were closing because of Covid here in my state and there was that general sense of hysteria so I think they may have just been trying to get cars off the lot  😂 Those open roads during the early days of Covid were AMAZING with that car. I’m not going to lie, I had a freakin blast in that thing."

However, that being said, AMC is in an extremely bullish position to blow up very soon as confirmed by several sources with the amount of shorts due to cover, so while I fully respect OP's decision and salute him for cutting his losses. He could have potentially quadrupled his profits if he just waited a little bit.

This is a fucking casino. Anyone who claims to know a stock is about to blow up is by definition not legit"
2021-06-05 09:20:57,wallstreetbets,"Well said, thanks"
2021-06-05 13:49:01,wallstreetbets,"First off. I never said anyone ""knows"" that AMC will blow up. I said it's in an *extremely bullish* position to do so. Meaning we're operating on raw confidence and speculation. Not fortune tellers or time travelers. 

Secondly. What exactly constitutes a ""legitimate"" source in your eyes? You're already fully aware that stock predictions are based entirely on nothing more than analytics and opinions which are only as accurate as the information recorded, which could just as well be wrong, especially in cases where illegal unreported shit is going on like with AMC/GME. Hence why I said OP had the *potential* to quadruple his profits and not me saying that he's ""guaranteed"" those profits. 

And lastly. If you're actually genuinely interested, I can share with you some pretty good analysts / DD that are of the stance that its gonna blow. But if you're just looking for an empty debate. Then no, I'm not gonna bother trying to convince someone who doesn't actually want to be convinced."
2021-06-05 14:03:17,wallstreetbets,"There are no legitimate sources for when a stock will blow up is exactly my point. The market is fickle. Trying to predict the timing of big swings in the market or individual stocks is largely impossible. Multiple studies have shown this to be true. Anyone saying they know when a stock will blow up (or go down) is full of shit.
All of your DD/ analysis is garbage. As is everyone else’s. Again studies have shown that almost no one can reliably predict the market. Sure sometimes people are right, that’s just statistics. 

Trading individual stocks is literally a casino. And I’m fine with that. I do it all the time. And it’s fun to use DD and pretend like it actually matter. But don’t tell there are reliable sources AMC is about to pop.  Especially not when it just popped like 400% in 2 weeks and 2500% this year."
2021-06-05 14:47:23,wallstreetbets,Long story short. You're looking for an empty debate. Oh well. Moving on.
2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"THE BIG SHORT 2.0, COLLAPSE OF THE BOND MARKET IS UNAVOIDABLE (post was removed last time, did i fix the issue mods?)

Michael Burry, the infamous investor who profited massively off the 2008 housing bubble is predicting, like many others, a collapse of the bond market. (Source: Scion Asset Management 13F) [He was even payed a visit by the SEC due to this warning](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-says-hell-stop-tweeting-after-sec-regulators-paid-him-a-visit/articleshow/81569128.cms), prompting him to delete his twitter account.

The FED only has two options at the moment:

Raise rates to curb current inflation. This would cause the treasury to raise its coupon rates (bond interest), which would mean lower bond prices. This means the government has to pay higher interest, ultimately leaving the treasury no other option than defaulting on its obligations.

2. The FED doesnt raise rates, and lets inflation (and later hyperinflation) eat away at the dollar. This would also make the bonds worth less, as theyd have to lower the price to compensate for the interest being worth nothing. In this situation, the fed would be the only one willing to hold government bonds which would worsen the inflation as they effectively dont get payed interest on it.

Option one, the government goes bankrupt due to interests being to high to pay back. Option two, the public goes bankrupt due to hyperinflation.

Either way, a short position would profit in this trade.

Am I overseeing something here fellow retards? It literally cannot go titsup."
2021-06-04 20:37:36,wallstreetbets,It’s pretty easy to lose more money while waiting for corrections than during actual corrections.
2021-06-04 21:50:02,wallstreetbets,"OP Father Burry is right in that bonds have farther to fall imo.  How far will they fall, only god knows. However, the nightmare scenario you speak of reeks of gold hustlers like Peter Schief and James Rickards. What you may not be aware of is over 80% of assets in the entire world are in USD. There is a tone of domestic consumers of debt, whether it be Social Security, Corporations, Public and Private Pension and Retirement Funds. They will continue to buy bonds which allows the treasury to issue debt for a long time. 26% of US Nat Debt is owned by elements of the US government itself (god only knows about what states own) and they will continue buying. How exactly does a federal government default on itself when it can forgive the debt? Dare I bring up Ponzi scheme comparisons here. Also, hyperinflation has only ever occurred where a government has had to issue large amounts of its currency to purchase another currency or where the issuer of the currency/debt is seen as so untrustworthy regarding the currency itself. IE amounts of Bonds sold or Purchased by a central bank.  However, I do believe the FED will be forced to raise rates because they care more about inflation than they do employment. The powers that be care more about their wealth than they do the people they employ."

2021-06-05 00:11:45,wallstreetbets,"I see two issues (and yeah I'm open to correction)

1. Inflation is not hyperinflation.  I lived through mortgage rates at >12% in the 80's.  That wasn't hyperinflation then, and it would not be now.
2. Effect of interest rates on bond prices.  CURRENT bond prices would be worth less.  NEW bond prices would be worth more.  That's what higher interest does...makes bonds worth more.

A long time ago before 2008, the market used to swing between bull and bear in a 4-6 year cycle.  Stocks for 18 months, bonds for 18 months, see-saw in-between.  Nowadays, you younguns think 3% is ""high"" interest rate and a three week correction is a bear market!  Oh you sweet summer child!"

Bonds have become far less popular with the extended oustanding performance of the stock market (my retired mother recently had her financial advisor move a little out of bonds and into ETFs which says something at her age)

Once the stock market is considered shaky again the world's giant pool of money will once again flow more heavily into treasury bonds. But the US government is not about to collapse from a fucking rate hike and that is a gross mischaracterization of what occurred in march 2020"

Right now, 80% of all international contracts are denominated in usd. If there is global instability, what is the first thing all of these institutions will do? Panic buy usd to make sure they can fulfill their obligations and remain alive.

This is why under Obama the UST was downgraded and in the mad scramble to safety everyone went out to purchase more USTs

Yes, there will be a collapse of the usd and the ust, but along the way there will be a max short squeeze on the usd. A strong usd looks a lot like a market crash and a liquidity crises. I will go long, and dump my usd into commodities to prepare for the hyper inflation."

What to do, what to do🤔"
2021-06-05 04:11:34,wallstreetbets,"Tbh, IMO, I don’t believe scenario 1 is at all possible. Because, there’s no point in raising interest rates just yet. Especially, when it’s no reason to just yet when it’s a new budget being formed and with the raising of taxes just a smidge will offset inflation. 

Personally, I believe the feds are going to give congress ample time to pass a new budget one that takes inflation into account. So, they can raise interest rates simultaneously. As, the economy goes back to work and the economy is firing on all cylinders we can pay off our debt at the same time we accumulate it."

2021-06-05 10:57:43,wallstreetbets,"What I don’t see a lot of discussion around is the deflationary pressure of all the debt out there. Record student loan debt, new inflated mortgage debt from a crazy house market, inflated grocery and other index prices. I think we are all well aware of the Fed’s inflationary policies but what if they are concerned with the incoming deflation no one seems to want to talk about? Sure, there’s a lot of money and liquidity from stimulus payments but it seems like it’s going to either pay off debt (deflationary) or used to improve credit worthiness to take on more debt like a mortgage (deflationary). 

It’s annoying to see the same points about inflation but no counter points with deflation. Maybe I’m an optimist but I think the Fed knows what that are doing by keeping inflation high to mitigate deflationary pressures on the market.

And that’s just the start of the deflationary pressures in our current economy. I could argue that income inequality/wealth concentration is deflationary along with monopolistic practices by oligopoly corporations like Amazon and google. Wealth concentration is deflationary because wealthy people don’t spend their money or use credit the same way the middle class does. Their money is not being circulated back into the economy at the same rate as ours because they can spend 1% or less of their salary and possibly meet all their needs."

2021-06-05 09:36:54,wallstreetbets,"Daily inflation-indexed bonds (also known as inflation-linked bonds or colloquially as linkers) are bonds where the principal is indexed to inflation or deflation on a daily basis. They are thus designed to hedge the inflation risk of a bond.[1] The first known inflation-indexed bond was issued by the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1780.[2] The market has grown dramatically since the British government began issuing inflation-linked Gilts in 1981. As of 2019, government-issued inflation-linked bonds comprise over $3.1 trillion of the international debt market.[3] The inflation-linked market primarily consists of sovereign bonds, with privately issued inflation-linked bonds constituting a small portion of the market.

2021-06-05 14:49:10,wallstreetbets,That is a very indirect trade. I think it is smarter to directly play the theory. Think about what happens with higher interest rates.

2021-06-05 10:08:10,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand the ""I want my money back"" comment either.

But, I think the idea is the bonds are sold over and over to other willing buyers who think ""this is a deal"", which leads to an ever lower price as more people buy into the idea OP is saying. If the pressure is high enough, bonds have collapsed, and that causes yields to skyrocket (a 1% coupon payment on a $33 bond with $100 face value is a 3% yield). Skyrocketing yields would crush valuations on the stock market, particularly in growth companies who's value is based on future performance and cash flow. 

What I don't understand is that if the fed raises rates, you'll get more willing buyers of bonds, so prices won't collapse. The fed can easily fund it's interest payments the same way they have been for a century - run a deficit. There has yet to be any significant consequence for continual deficits, and I'm not eager to find out what they are - surely there is a consequence more serious than fiscal conservatives saying ""you can't run a deficit forever"". The democrats target plan seems to be raise taxes to fund it.

Buying a house isn’t spurring productivity.

Investing in new small businesses and entrepreneurs spurs productivity, but the issue is that many markets have fossilized in the developed world.

A mixture of technology, globalization, pro large corp policy, and lack of growing markets/cities (population) means large corporations are consolidating in markets and small/new businesses are harder to create and grow.

How many new pharmacies or hardware manufacturers do you see?

Only tech and biotech see real entrepreneurship, traditional industries are really uncompetitive. 

The answer is to enforce anti trust laws, subsidize small business investments or tax those investments more favorably than investing in stocks, and enable people to invest in themselves by improving access to education, healthcare, and higher wages.

People can start new businesses when they have enough money and a decent safety net to quit their full time job."

Things get pretty nasty, if The average persons’ mortgage become so low in value that the lenders collapse, (because lender income from the mortgages isn’t enough to pay their employees a living wage anymore due to massive inflation).

And then that just cascades. Horrifically.

So the US wouldn’t default in that situation. It could only default on non-US denominated debt, which we lack at the moment. The only other way the US could default would be to do so selectively on our own dollar denominated debt in an attempt to avoid hyper inflation. 

If you mean an intentional default to attempt to trip hyperinflation then perhaps. But from a straight on perspective, there are other policy measures that could be taken to get out of hyper inflation without needing to directly default.

Regarding wealth preservation, only real assets or foreign holdings would largely counter hyper inflation. But you would need to be positioned with those going into it... as redirecting after hyper inflation starts may become difficult as folks move away from domestic currency transactions to bartering real assets"

2021-06-04 22:24:30,wallstreetbets,Wealth creation depends on productivity. Making stuff. Farming. Manufacturing. Exports. It does not depend on debt ratios or some fantasy of crazed economists.
2021-06-05 03:34:32,wallstreetbets,No FUCKING SHIT. I never said we were. I said we WOULDVE BEEN if the fed didn’t raise the rates again. But the economy follows the stock market. If the stock market crashes so will the GDP. People in here really are retards.
2021-06-05 03:43:39,wallstreetbets,"The rates were lowered THE DAY AFTER they were hiked, in direct response to the stock market, the fed literally said it was too early to raise rates. They then cut the already historically low rates even further in March, which is what you’re referring to."
2021-06-05 03:41:26,wallstreetbets,"I wonder why the stock market had record highs after the pandemic was ravaging through the US then… investors are really scared of higher interest rates, even mainstream economists agree with this. Ms. Yellen at the FED mentioned they might have to raise rates a little earlier in may, and literally HAD to walk that statement back the very same day to calm the market."
2021-06-05 03:38:58,wallstreetbets,"That’s because interest rates are almost 0, dude. If interest rates are close to 0, and it still takes up 9% of your ridiculously large budget (not even comparable to any other country pr capita), you have a gigantic problem"
2021-06-04 20:07:34,wallstreetbets,Unicorn shit taste like cotton candy
2021-06-05 10:04:31,wallstreetbets,Thanks. It was a bad joke but it was a joke.
2021-06-04 23:58:21,wallstreetbets,"There are costs of healthcare, funerals, responsibilities, wills...

There are a lot of costs and economic strains in just letting the virus run its course 

Plus yknow, good people shouldnt be fine with so much preventable death"
2021-06-05 16:02:52,wallstreetbets,"Yup, inflation is the only way for governments to ""keep their promises"" and avoiding default while reneging on those promises in reality.

I've been told all my life my generation won't get social security. The reality is we're likely to get it but it won't be worth anything."
2021-06-04 23:20:21,wallstreetbets,I’m well aware of that. You’re clearly not understanding what I wrote. Good night
2021-06-05 13:10:46,wallstreetbets,That’s not always true. Stock market declines even bear markets do not always lead to recessions in the US
2021-06-04 21:07:28,wallstreetbets,I read that somewhere... it was either in one of my daughters coloring books or on the information super-highway.
2021-06-05 14:52:37,wallstreetbets,Quite good one tho😂
2021-06-05 03:12:23,wallstreetbets,"The economy gained 40% more liquidity, costs are NOT an issue, the issue is people spending way too much and raising prices of raw materials insane amounts"
2021-06-05 10:09:57,wallstreetbets,Bro a bunch more boomers would have died BFD. Gotta look at the broader picture.
2021-06-05 17:51:59,wallstreetbets,"The overall death rate didn’t change buddy. That means the factors you’re talking about don’t matter. A lot of healthcare utilisation fell as “non-vital” services were blocked for upwards of 6 months by states and hospitals, meaning people couldn’t even go in and spend money on treatment."
2021-06-05 16:55:14,wallstreetbets,That was my assessment as well. They can't just take it away without riots in the streets. Quietly getting rid of it with inflation might work though.
2021-06-05 10:26:09,wallstreetbets,"It's a lot more than just old people. I personally know a 20 year old who has been in and out of the hospital for blood clots in the lungs since getting covid. They were healthy as hell before.


There will be lasting side effects and this sociopathic idea of letting the virus run its course will just look more and more idiotic as the years go by and medical costs climb"
2021-06-05 12:09:05,wallstreetbets,"Stop watching so much CNN buddy. This whole thing is blown out of proportion. A few hundred thousand deaths will have little impact on the broad scope of the economy. Sure some people are fucked from the virus. But the shutdown economic impacts are much more relevant than a virus with a death rate of .01%. stop thinking about a few people who will have plans life long disabilities. Think about how fucked the next generation is from all this shit. That was the point of this. The gov doesn't give a fuck about our lives. We have to many people to begin with. If covid was as deadly as many people still think it is, we would have been under martial law and they would have given people a lot more than $1200 as a stimulus. Think about how long that money printer has been on before you focus on some 20 year old kid with lung damage, that no one gives a shit about."
2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Wish me luck Palantards 🚀🚀🚀 $PLTR 🚀🚀🚀

2021-06-04 22:47:49,wallstreetbets,Good luck.  I saved an my money for 6 months to buy 50 shares.
2021-06-04 23:35:12,wallstreetbets,Can you set up recurring investments for FDs?
2021-06-05 00:22:29,wallstreetbets,To the moon!

2021-06-05 14:20:22,wallstreetbets,"I don’t really mess around with options, but is a leap just an option like a year or 2 out? If not what is a leap?"
2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,$BB today 
2021-06-04 23:51:05,wallstreetbets,"Listen, I’m not invested in Blackberry, but maybe I can lend words of inspiration for the people that don’t love loss porn - mainly their own. I put a sizable amount in on AMC back in February and watched about 60% of it disappear in about two days. Did it feel foolish? You bet. But I also was able to laugh at it because it didn’t financially dictate my life.

 I put even more in. Not a degenerative amount mind you, but enough that said ‘fuck you I still believe in this stock’. Then I just forgot about it for the most part and didn’t let the stock consume me. 

Four months later I wake up to a text message from my friend pining about how he wished he didn’t have to sell his shares of AMC to pay rent.

So hold your shit and forget about it. And when it moons, celebrate it."
2021-06-04 20:10:35,wallstreetbets,Who the fuck is selling. I keep buying
2021-06-04 23:35:59,wallstreetbets,$BB to the moon 📈🔥📈🔥 This is the way
2021-06-04 21:07:24,wallstreetbets,haha. i bought bb this morning🙈
2021-06-04 20:55:26,wallstreetbets,I bought 200 call at $13 right by the closing time. BB stay strong!!
2021-06-04 22:22:27,wallstreetbets,"Monday Morning, We start all over again!"
2021-06-04 21:28:47,wallstreetbets,Flawless. See you Monday morning
2021-06-04 21:28:49,wallstreetbets,"I put a whole roughly $65 into AMC around $6 ('cause I'm a high-roller), turned it into a bit over $300 (> 5x return). Hands went paper a day before it hit $70, so I'm a bitch...

...but, a gain's a gain, and I wanna ride the rocket too, so I turned around and dumped it ALL into BB at $16.

I leaned my lesson, these hands stay diamond until the end of time... or, until it hits $100 anyway :)

I'm in with the apes and idiots, let's do this!"
2021-06-04 22:28:14,wallstreetbets,"My prediction for today was red, I’m feeling green on Monday tho"
2021-06-04 23:41:50,wallstreetbets,"I lost $10,000 today which wasn't too bad because yesterday I lost $30,000. When you have less, losing 50% doesn't hurt as bad. Maybe next time I lose 50% it'll be a meager $5k lol. STILL HOLDING! WOOT"
2021-06-05 00:37:16,wallstreetbets,110 shares at $16.15. Next week it will go up.
2021-06-05 02:00:44,wallstreetbets,Big money coming just hold your BB and if you can buy the dip. Squeeze is coming... Mark my word.
2021-06-05 02:39:11,wallstreetbets,I keep buying $BB since January 27 when it was highest 😂! My fellow apes don’t want to join me to the moon ! I have over 12k invested and I want to go to the moon !
2021-06-04 22:13:56,wallstreetbets,"These little boys.. crying over 12% on the day??

What has WSB become?"
2021-06-05 00:08:34,wallstreetbets,"I threw my largest investment ever on BB. It was all from AMC gains. Those AMC gains were all from stocks that were in the negative I had sold for a loss and reinvested. 

The circle continues. I’m not happy. I’m not sad. I started following this sub during the push for AMD. I made my first gains with AMD. Those gains were steady. I was patient. My impatience has been the only thing that’s killed me with investing.

I’m comfortable with my decision and I will hold with you all. Not holding has been the only thing that’s fucked me. I had AMC at $4 during the first downturn from Covid. I bought it at $9 last January. Sold both within days of purchasing. 

There’s a method in the madness here."
2021-06-05 00:10:34,wallstreetbets,"Down $2500 as well, not planning to sell till we go to the moon!

Apes buy BB, apes hold BB. Together we can!!"

2021-06-04 22:29:13,wallstreetbets,Well Bb supposed to be red when I look at it so what is the god damn issue here ? Are you all going to leave like little bitch after we said BB was next ? Not me and not any of the other ape here. BB will rise someday I never read about it but it will rise and I love my BB phone too.
2021-06-05 01:15:21,wallstreetbets,I am bullish for BB next week. Support level at $13 twice in the past two days. Most people have money sold in AMC will buy the cheaper price of BB so I will wait for next week. My target is $20 per share to profit
2021-06-04 20:34:05,wallstreetbets,We hit BB on Monday hard!!! THIS IS THE WAY!!! I’m all in and holding strong 💪🏾 I will never sell
2021-06-04 22:04:43,wallstreetbets,Love this movie so I was laughing my ass off.

2021-06-05 12:52:39,wallstreetbets,"If you apes had any brain at all, any capacity to learn, you’d know that selling BB is moronic. The squeeze comes and the squeeze goes but if it’s a meme, it doesn’t stop until moon tier gains are acquired. Monday, bitches. Next week is the week of the ape. Remember it. That’s absolute morons bragging about walking away with peanut tier profits, bragging about screwing their fellow apes, will be crying FOMO tears next week. Believe me, I know"

You’re all a disgrace. Downvote me go ahead that’ll really teach me.

....right?"
2021-06-05 01:01:28,wallstreetbets,Awww that’s cute BB lost $3 a share and the “diamond hands” crumbled. There’s a reason y’all ain’t on the AMC/GME 🚀 y’all would fall off.
2021-06-05 08:17:40,wallstreetbets,"BB is not a $GME or $AMC story, kids.

You might not think so, but rules do apply to the process.

I know what it feels like to hold the bag so I’m not smirking at your misfortune in the least. I’m genuinely suggesting you be careful out there."

2021-06-04 23:48:00,wallstreetbets,"been there in jan, this time i got smarter, sold covered calls took my chances if i get my shares called over because it would moon like AMC so be it, I waited a bit, maybe even sold some of you calls against my shares at $20 expiring this week and next week. they lost 75-99% value and i bought it back for pennies on the dollar and sold more covered calls right away so now my BB position is like as if I paid just under 10 a share for them, better than my january fuck up position of close to 14 a share."

CNBC is my financial and Naked Short authority, advising me by broadcasting their informative DD."
2021-06-04 21:29:04,wallstreetbets,That’s because there was no reason to get behind BB or talk about it just a distraction from GME and AMC

2021-06-05 04:38:17,wallstreetbets,I really like this stock. I loved that damn phone too i miss buttons.
2021-06-05 02:56:49,wallstreetbets,"Need to wait for AMC, then I have money for bb"
2021-06-04 23:32:49,wallstreetbets,lol yeah but their ceo did them dirty

2021-06-05 01:16:37,wallstreetbets,Next week BB will be bullish and stronger
2021-06-04 20:30:22,wallstreetbets,Entered @15.20 and averaged down to $14.86 for a total of 690 shares. Down ~$1k as well.
2021-06-04 23:33:23,wallstreetbets,Who cares it’s a solid investment. Red days are nothing lol in the long term it’s most likely going up. I don’t even check the charts till after close lol
2021-06-04 20:44:22,wallstreetbets,413 shares average @10.30 I averaged up when I bought 170 right before close.. hold on to them. It will pay off for sure. Big things for BB
2021-06-05 00:23:19,wallstreetbets,I was out when I lost $30. Might buy at lower price.
2021-06-05 03:05:30,wallstreetbets,This is the way💎🙌🏼🚀
2021-06-04 21:38:49,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks

2021-06-05 09:57:00,wallstreetbets,"Been bagholding since Jan, what's a little while longer? Will be a good time to average down."
2021-06-05 13:00:08,wallstreetbets,Holding till the end 🌙
2021-06-05 01:33:20,wallstreetbets,72 shares at $15.50 I’m going to average up on Monday
2021-06-05 05:12:49,wallstreetbets,Buy shares and hold
2021-06-05 00:32:28,wallstreetbets,"These guys are worried about their Fedcoin, all I’m counting are how many blackberries I have. 🍇"
2021-06-04 23:34:42,wallstreetbets,"Did the same, bought 100 and did a covered call"
2021-06-05 05:11:05,wallstreetbets,"Yup I bought higher than I wanted, since etoro fucked us with bb somehow being closed with the rest of the market open so mine filled at 20... not at open like I ordered. But the company still has legs, its profit from dropping amc since the company itself is well lacking and I liked 400% gains."
2021-06-05 01:37:36,wallstreetbets,"Damn straight! I sold my AMC gains , and brought 72 shares of BB with it. And  I plan on averaging up when. Monday comes."
2021-06-05 07:42:31,wallstreetbets,">My target is $20 per share to profit


Which is the high on most 12m forecasts on BB, lol"
2021-06-05 11:37:41,wallstreetbets,he had 2 tabs open clearly
2021-06-05 03:40:37,wallstreetbets,Even cuter that you are being an asshole.  I’m still holding gme and sold amc for massive gains.  Don’t act like people weren’t crying when gme and amc dipped.
2021-06-05 11:33:16,wallstreetbets,Remember when AMC and GME took a face plant? Now look.
2021-06-04 22:23:34,wallstreetbets,It’s a software security company.
2021-06-05 11:35:40,wallstreetbets,They all do but look at them now
2021-06-05 03:26:57,wallstreetbets,Two for the money
2021-06-05 03:25:34,wallstreetbets,Two for the money (2005)
2021-06-05 03:53:46,wallstreetbets,“That’s because there was no reason to get behind AMC or talk about it just a distraction from GME” - upvoted comments galore from last March
2021-06-05 11:42:27,wallstreetbets,BB is part of the B.A.G
2021-06-05 08:02:15,wallstreetbets,"So no AMC or GME, lol"
2021-06-05 00:49:40,wallstreetbets,Lmfao
2021-06-04 23:19:04,wallstreetbets,they were just not for you
2021-06-05 04:36:33,wallstreetbets,I made the same calls it’s all goodie we gonna buy more shares and squeeze the bastards. When the price jumps they can’t resist buying back in works every time. Wall Street tells us not to have FOMO while always having it.
2021-06-05 02:53:33,wallstreetbets,I was in the boat with you. Everything seemed lined up so perfectly. Sell AMC buy BB and to the moon for real. Just felt like fuckery after pre market. I'm still like wtf happened.
2021-06-04 23:37:28,wallstreetbets,"16.14, could have sell it at 20. I did not. I do not regret it."
2021-06-05 04:37:15,wallstreetbets,This is the way🚀
2021-06-05 11:20:28,wallstreetbets,This is the way 🚀 keep squeezing and you get more juice
2021-06-05 00:29:25,wallstreetbets,Don’t you ever bring logic in here!!!!
2021-06-05 01:37:17,wallstreetbets,"Why would I count Saturday and Sunday?  


Three days: Thursday, Friday, MOONDAY."
2021-06-05 00:26:52,wallstreetbets,Can we get the market to open Sunday?
2021-06-05 03:48:32,wallstreetbets,This guy knows his numbers

2021-06-05 16:44:17,wallstreetbets,"I know, right?! Saw the money I lost, and doubled down!

2021-06-05 04:17:58,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m down $12k but I’m still holding.

2021-06-05 08:30:18,wallstreetbets,Down 11.84%  $2.5k hoping Monday breaks me even again 🦍
2021-06-05 11:31:48,wallstreetbets,"I held -50k for months on BB .. honestly the situation made me so numb to it, now it doesn’t even phase me when we pullback $BB 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-05 01:44:41,wallstreetbets,"Cool stuff, Kenny."
2021-06-05 10:47:32,wallstreetbets,Bought 1574 shares @ 18.75
2021-06-05 08:56:47,wallstreetbets,Condolences
2021-06-05 03:04:06,wallstreetbets,Put this in a post on the main page. Good info for apes that don’t do any DD. Next week is gonna be a good week💎🙌🏼🚀
2021-06-05 11:18:17,wallstreetbets,OnwardMobility is where you'll find that.
2021-06-05 02:24:18,wallstreetbets,"Wasn't even that bad though... They sold 8 million shares that already existed but were optioned to the board. The board gave up their shares to raise capital and that's an amazing thing but caused a $20 loss cause ""oh no CEO bad derrr""... Meanwhile Kathy or whatever her name is sells 40 million shares and no one's even talking about it... Caused a $4 loss..."
2021-06-04 22:43:21,wallstreetbets,"Hey you are not retarded alone. I bought a bull call spread, bought 3 20$ calls and sold 3 30$ calls. At -30% I bought the 30$ calls back, my only regret is that I didnt wait, because right now Ive lost 70%, so I could have made a little extra when buying back those calls.

I am still unsure if I should buy 2 more or roll them out to 2nd of July..."
2021-06-05 00:02:55,wallstreetbets,It’s Friday. Usual market drop.
2021-06-04 22:41:53,wallstreetbets,"I got 10 contracts $18 for 6/18, I feel your pain."
2021-06-04 23:15:52,wallstreetbets,Im in at 19 for 6/18 told myself to go longer. Thought we would be in lambos by now
2021-06-05 00:15:06,wallstreetbets,I did 25 calls at $21 on 6/18.  Doh.  At highest price of day.  $7.21.  Couldn’t have timed It any better !!
2021-06-04 21:33:46,wallstreetbets,I sold a covered call for 6/23@$22. Free tendies!!!
2021-06-04 21:28:38,wallstreetbets,"Down 6k but i am sure it will be back up , AMC boys will help us"
2021-06-05 10:17:56,wallstreetbets,"Only one thing to do when it dips, HOLD"
2021-06-05 12:29:52,wallstreetbets,"Hey man just friendly advice, wait a few weeks before you average down anymore.  I think you'll be able to average down with sub 10 shares in a few weeks.

If I'm wrong then you still win.  The price is going somewhere, it wont stay where it stands today that is the only thing you can really count on."
2021-06-04 21:43:26,wallstreetbets,"Where TF have you been???? All ive see is ppl spammimg 40+ by this week or next week. I tried talking some sense in them saying they were being too unrealistic but id just get downvoted hard. As soon as it goes down, now we see the more realistic ppl giving an actual estimate of when the stock should hit those heights. 

Im now convinced that all these ""2 the moon"" ppl are the same ones investing HUGE amounts and trying to get as many ppl on board before swiping the rug from under their feet"
2021-06-04 20:55:26,wallstreetbets,Same but 400@ 3.90 I think
2021-06-04 21:40:47,wallstreetbets,"🤣🤣🤣 yes I do a lot, I hope I don’t end up fucking myself up lol"
2021-06-04 20:53:38,wallstreetbets,"It hit 20$ right in the middle of a meeting so I couldn't sell my january 18$ bag. I'm not selling for a loss, this thing is worth 25$ so it's back to bagholding again..."
2021-06-04 20:11:48,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-04 22:00:07,wallstreetbets,Same bought in at $19 what is up my fellow bag holder.
2021-06-05 11:21:42,wallstreetbets,Felt like AMC was just a bag since Jan now look.
2021-06-04 20:54:42,wallstreetbets,"Hi, I’m Sanchez!"
2021-06-04 21:12:10,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that’s the joke"
2021-06-04 23:10:50,wallstreetbets,100% autist unable to recognize humor. How many letters have I typed in this comment?
2021-06-05 02:34:33,wallstreetbets,Three to get ready?
2021-06-05 10:07:48,wallstreetbets,I randomly watched this yesterday and was thinking that would be a great scene for something like this. Nice job!
2021-06-04 21:07:32,wallstreetbets,^ will die a virgin
2021-06-05 13:28:37,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Because we didn’t cry about a $3 loss
2021-06-05 10:19:13,wallstreetbets,"AMC, now?

Yeah, don't buy them, not until their price is eventually corrected to before this squeeze.

GME is the only exception I forgot to mention.

All the other meme stocks though? Buy them when they are down and when this sub has forgotten about them, or is just talking shit about them. 

That's how I walked away with 90% profits on BB and I can now double it down when it dips."
2021-06-05 05:51:55,wallstreetbets,LMAO!
2021-06-05 19:23:08,wallstreetbets,20s were for me

2021-06-05 04:13:37,wallstreetbets,Fly to Japan
2021-06-05 03:28:15,wallstreetbets,Can you explain to me how a higher short interest is good for the bulls? I am a bit new at this.
2021-06-05 12:10:13,wallstreetbets,Agreed
2021-06-04 22:55:27,wallstreetbets,I’m not a financial advisor
2021-06-05 12:26:16,wallstreetbets,I would tell you to stop buying calls on this stock.  Put some eggs in another basket or just straight up buy more BB outright.
2021-06-05 02:15:24,wallstreetbets,25 calls $20 for 6/18.... I was up 6k when it hit $20 on Thursday..... Awkward.
2021-06-04 23:29:29,wallstreetbets,Thetagang rise up
2021-06-05 01:17:12,wallstreetbets,Yeah I have heard many AMC apes already sold their shares today and buying BB Monday
2021-06-05 11:31:18,wallstreetbets,Buy more

2021-06-04 23:26:48,wallstreetbets,"How do you think this works lol

Same with the AMC and GME bagholders that say shit like 50k is the floor"
2021-06-04 21:42:17,wallstreetbets,"If you can't fuck yourself well, then what hope do you have with others."
2021-06-04 21:24:00,wallstreetbets,Why...why not set a good til canceled limit? 19.50 or some such?
2021-06-04 22:50:40,wallstreetbets,I’ll find out next week if I’m up for a emotional roller coaster
2021-06-05 09:03:23,wallstreetbets,I’m more of a Preston Parker guy myself

2021-06-05 09:56:33,wallstreetbets,LETS FUCKING GO! Tell your gfs husband to buy in. I'll see him on the moon baby
2021-06-05 07:34:45,wallstreetbets,They are betting against the stock. They borrow shares (say at $10) and sell them into the market hoping the price will go down so that they can buy them back at a lower price (say it goes down to $8 they make $2 per every share - the interest they have to pay to borrow the share usually 1%) now it the price goes up through buying they have to buy back at a higher price causing the price to go even higher. just now there is a belief that these short sellers are using illegal practices to force the price down which people are fighting against. These people obviously don't want to pay back at these higher prices and are seemimgly digging themselves a bigger hole.
2021-06-05 13:18:33,wallstreetbets,"Higher short interest means IF the price goes up, those shorts need to cover at a higher price. When the shorts are forced to buy ASAP to mitigate their losses, price goes up even more."
2021-06-04 22:57:00,wallstreetbets,I guess two damaged brains are worse than one so I will just toss a coin
2021-06-05 12:31:48,wallstreetbets,"I thought our mantra around here was ""anything under 140 is a dip"" lolol"
2021-06-04 21:48:15,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, the same way I talk with myself by myself because I know myself and I agree with my expert self !!!!"
2021-06-04 21:37:35,wallstreetbets,Completely forgot about that. Realised it later on but I was quite rusty after 5 months of zero trading and looking at BB chart once every week.
2021-06-05 13:31:24,wallstreetbets,Young JMac and Preston were slaying back in the day.
2021-06-05 00:06:24,wallstreetbets,I personally like the pig strategy
2021-06-04 21:55:23,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m a wordy son of a bitch. 19-21 on the next peak- if higher than 20 then there will be more higher peaks to come.
2021-06-04 21:53:40,wallstreetbets,I was doing the song *sigh* Nevermind 🤦🏻‍♂️
2021-06-05 08:41:54,wallstreetbets,Appreciate your explanation. But all you did was explaining what a short is. But why is this good news for holders? It doesn't drive the price up
2021-06-04 21:56:45,wallstreetbets,I love the voices in my head also
2021-06-04 22:34:01,wallstreetbets,2girls for the cup
2021-06-05 09:07:31,wallstreetbets,I assume you know what a squeeze is? If there's a high SI then there's the potential for a good short squeeze. Look at what is happening with amc and gme due to the high short interest
2021-06-05 11:14:27,wallstreetbets,"If a stock's price rises quickly, then short sellers sometimes scramble to close out their positions quickly to stop the bleeding. A high volume of investors who are shorting a stock and need to exit their positions at the same time creates a short squeeze. All the closing positions cause the stock price to 🚀"
2021-06-04 21:58:44,wallstreetbets,Because you know yourself wayyy too well 😉
2021-06-05 09:19:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah sure thing, but everybody needs to be on board then and apebuy the shit out of BB. 

As long that ain't happening, there's no good news in rising SI I guess."
2021-06-05 11:16:38,wallstreetbets,The short interest should climb so long as BlackBerry holds it's price valuation. If they got brass balls.
2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,WKHS YOLO

The judges and presenters will all squirm uncomfortably for some time as they attempt to clench their buttcheeks and hold back the sprays of brown water, but eventually someone will crack and shart and, if it’s one of the judges, they have to invest in the pitch. If it’s one of the presenters they have to watch their invention get sharted on."

sound like job you say? because it is

edit: i also suggest before you even look at a graph, look at the day & 52week range first. where is the price on that scale? 

then start looking at the graph from today, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months etc. what’s the trend?

from there i analyze wsb and refer to REAL market news before i make my decision.

But, If I walk in a straight line for one hour in an easterly direction, I will arrive at the exact time I departed.  Surely this has to be a sign that second chances are plentiful in this barren wasteland.  Unfortunately, the seven vodka tonics have rendered this task impossible.  Straight lines are as fleeting as second chances.  My only option is to follow my nose to the nearest Churches Chicken and sleep next to the dumpster until they open."

For some things, like my watch, no amount of measured introspection can fade away those finer palates of familiar despair."

2021-06-04 22:39:03,wallstreetbets,"How to get rich written by Large Hotdog. Remember this boys and girls with pps and suck me off in the future. Buy me a Rarri   

Buy shares. Only buy shares on red days. Do not sell shares. Ever. Do not buy on Green Days (sometimes is ok. Better to wait and not buy at all). That’s basically most of it. Hold long term. If it drops lower than what you paid for it, buy more dumbass. Assuming it’s a great company like Alibaba and is undervalued. 

Options: 
don’t yOLo Tesla weekly fd. Yes they can win but they can lose faster. F that. Buy 3 months min time. Buy leaps on a crash. Better than weeklie burns. Options are always a risk but hey sometimes risk is good. .3 delta is good. Watch theta always

Watch corn and riot will move with it. Nice scalp opportunity. But it’s a stock at the end of the day. Corn can be up and riot (or Mara or any others) can still be down

Corn volatility makes great scalps on its friends. Risky but it works. 

Just get rich. And I’m in the red btw from doing Yolo crap. 

But i always end up 5x so Watch for more

2021-06-05 04:23:42,wallstreetbets,"**CLNE:**

“The shares drive the volatility and price up. ​ The calls are so damned cheap that when you buy the shares, the calls explode. ​ Look at it this way: You buy 100 calls for $1.00 a contract. You buy no shares. The price stays the same. You lose $100. ​ You buy 50 calls for $1.00 a contract. Then you buy some shares. The price goes up. The calls are now worth $20 each. You make money. ​ You buy calls for $1.00 and then buy shares. The price jumps to $20 because of a gamma squeeze t hat takes place at $13. You made money on your shares and now you made $700 for each $1 you spent on calls. You are now rich and laugh at apes who talk about 10 baggers. ​ Yin and yang. With a setup like is presently there, you can't have one without the other. You can make money with shares. You can get filthy fucking rich with literal-penny calls so long as the shares still get purchased. ​ More importantly, it can't just be you. You need the apes. You have to somehow divert their attention from the hypnosis watch they're currently fixated on long enough for them to decide they'd like to upgrade to plantains from bananas. And that's where the problem is.”

The mentality that ""eventually it's bound to return to where I bought it"" doesn't consider that taking a 10% loss and selling allows you to invest 90% of your original investment into a winner with much better rate of return.

now heres the kicker, the jackass then opened a dispute on the paypal side, i responded to paypal THAT THE PAYMENT WAS ALREADY REFUNDED AND CLEARLY HAD REFUNDED STATUS ON IT.

i lost the dispute, the piece of shit requested a refund on an payment that was already in refunded status and won, so i ended up losing my item and the cost of the item on top, like how fukken stupid can a company be to apply a refund on something that was already refunded?

that was the day i quit selling on ebay and using paypal

fuk ebay and paypal"

Don’t be like me trying to learn to code at age 27/28. Learn early. The more you think oh I’ll learn it later, the longer you’ll stall. It’s not worth it.

You’ll watch your friends make 80k-100k while you only earn 40/50k. 

As an older guy, I encourage my brothers to work hard, even if it’s tough. Girls, they come later or when youre done studying for the day.

Please, I beg of you all to work hard. Let’s do this together brothers."

Meme tards get a Daily Discussion if their obsession is *worth* a Daily Discussion, as decided by predefined rules. That way they can't bitch when suddenly there's no more AMC thread or whatever.

But it also pulls them out of the real Daily when their stock heats up.

That would be best imo"
2021-06-05 11:31:01,wallstreetbets,"On a serious note, the best way to keep it organized is to leave the daily thread as it is and let the newer and more spam heavy users post there whatever they want. Since they’re going to do that no matter what. 

And then make a second daily thread (Veteran Autist thread?) for non-meme stock discussion. Top 2-3 tickers are soft banned there. Then the people irritated at seeing GME or AMC spam can simply go to alt thread themselves to see more quality comments even if there’s fewer overall."

2021-06-05 13:43:50,wallstreetbets,"So sometimes it’s a relief to mix shit posting with normal stock talk... However,posts this past week have clogged up good conversations and taken away from the threads purpose.

Is there anyway to **soft-ban** users from **spamming** about a ticker **several times in a row** or if there is like **30 comments on the same ticker with xx amount of time** to soft-ban?? Or even **tighten** those **restrictions** **based on age of the account**?"

I made money on accident a few years ago and lost it all trying to time and hop ships, made some, lost some. But you can't stop if you want to change yourself. Just don't over-invest and get wiped out on one mistake, and make learning your primary objective instead of being greedy.

2021-06-05 15:10:57,wallstreetbets,"First, it depends on what kind of women you want to meet. If you want something temporary and quick, probably Tinder or a bar. 

If you want something a little more serious and committed (like a gf -> fiance -> wife), then you have to consider a few key things. If you work backwards from top down and think about how to end up with a good, stable relationship, then you will come up with an answer on where to go. Here are the steps:

- Key is common interest, which results in compatibility. If you are genuinely interested in something, and she likes it too, you will like her and she will like you as a consequence. If it happens this way, it'll seem like it happened way too easy, and it should.

- So find an interest/passion, then pursue a community involving it. Look up online forums, go to conventions, meetups, trips, to wherever your interest or hobby takes place. 

- Talk to anyone and everyone you see. Male, female, ugly, beautiful, quiet, obnoxious. Talk to them, befriend them, hang out with anyone and everyone within that circle of interest. 

- You will either find your likely candidate directly this way, or she will come in the form of a friend-of-a-friend. When she bites, it will be hook, line, and sinker.

Now, keeping a girlfriend and maintaining a healthy relationship is another story. And if kids ever come, hah. Ask me again then! May good fortune be with you, autist."
2021-06-05 15:00:55,wallstreetbets,"Take up a hobby/sport that has local Facebook groups, go to the meet-ups, actually make friends (both sexes) and network."

I went outside to turn the sprinklers off and there was a robin pulling worms out of the ground as they came up to drink the cool water. This particular robin has become fearless of me, I can move within 3 feet of him without him flying away. On my way back in I notice he took a massive crap in the center of the sidewalk right in front of the stairs back into my house. Marking his territory, combined with his fearlessness, makes me believe he thinks this is his home now."

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I am an engineer and subcontractor for the largest telecommunications companies in the world, i.e., Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T, and several others. I am here to talk about the lesser-known companies that innovate and produce the technology for these companies. At present, the United States is approximately 15% covered by 5G services. However, T-Mobile, the fastest growing and most eager to implement 5G technology, is looking to cover more than 90% of the US within the next ten years. They've proven this by adding thousands of new sites nationwide with no slowing down in site. 

The primary manufacturer of their 5G antennas and radio equipment is ERICSSON ($ERIC$), a Swedish telecommunications technology company. 

Ericsson is an international company that researches, develops, and produces cutting-edge technology for the largest telecommunications companies in the world. They specialize in Macro sites, sites that cover a large area. Think large cell phone tower or antennas on a rooftop. Ericsson, Samsung, and Huawei dominate the competition in this field, but only Ericsson has the future in mind. 

5G technology, unlike LTE, 4G, and 3G, requires more frequent sites because the wavelength of higher frequency radio waves travel a shorter distance. I pulled this from google to make more sense of my point: ""The shorter wavelength means **5G can** carry a lot of data **much** faster than 4G, but it also means a **much** shorter range. 4G wavelengths have a range of about 10 miles. **5G** wavelengths have a range of about 1,000 feet, not even 2% of 4G's range.""

With that said, Ericsson is shifting research and development into a small cell infrastructure. Instead of a giant tower with massive 8' long antennas, think of a router size device that is 5G ready. This technology will cover factories, events, tight city blocks where radio signals cannot penetrate, and other niche areas of the same concept. Moreover, they can provide 5G service in places their competitors cannot. 

They are the leaders, if not the innovators of this space. Ericsson's upside is that they invested billions of dollars in the past and are thriving now because of it. In addition, Ericsson has a proven track record of innovation and quality that is unmatched.

Lastly, Huawei is sketchy, and Samsung's technology is dog water. 

Buy Ericsson stock with me, and I'll meet you on the moon."

  Basically, unless you live in Seattle, Portland, New York, Houston, ie: large cities.  
With a 5G phone you're better off just on WiFi. Because the cellular signal will drop dead at basically the same range, and then you're right back to 4G wavelengths. [[Continued...]](https://www.resavr.com/comment/am-an-engineer-subcontractor-16507589)

Yes, Ericsson was/is beating them in the radio space and Nokia had to play catch up, but it seems like they are catching up.

Moving forward I expect you'll see more Nokia radios mixed in at those small cell deployments - not just the Nokia BBU in the racks."

2021-06-05 14:24:32,wallstreetbets,"An engineering degree is the epitome of logical thinking, math and science. Engineers eat sleep and breath math. Engineers and mathematicians get hired all of the time by Wallstreet firms. A few of my classmates back in the day were recruited by Wallstreet firms. I regularly beat the market by reading and actually understanding how companies were doing their lab work on different drugs because my chemical engineering degree gave me great insight because I studied that material.


Engineers are some of the best people to listen to in terms of investing as long as they understand economics. A lot of economics majors couldn't do engineering because of the more difficult math and sciences. But engineers regularly go into investing and economics because it's a step down in terms of difficulty. There are some investing firms that go into much more depth and need the mathematicians and engineers. 

""Trading can be incredibly mathematical in nature, especially as it pertains to derivatives. Math, engineering, and physics majors are highly sought after by recruiters because of their ability to understand incredibly quantitative concepts, while learning to apply them in creative ways. For instance, the famous Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model can be reduced to the heat equation, and newer iterations of option pricing models rely heavily on stochastic volatility modeling.""

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLNE goes beyond the 6/18 event - this is great hold at a 50% discount 🚀🌕 You'd have to be blind to have not seen the chatter on here and other subs about $CLNE and the potential 🚀🌕 gamma squeeze event on 6/18. While the event is a realistic possibility and I'm buying more shares constantly to push it forward, the stock is also a great hold too.

The setup has been explained many times, and is basically a liftoff ramp up to an absolute rocket launch at the $13 price level, where 2.5 million shares worth of calls will be exercisable. They two keys are (1) shares must be bought to drive the price up, and low daily volume makes this drive pretty easy and (2) the call wall is firmly situated on June 18th, the target date.

# But, this post isn't about the squeeze opportunity:

If you want to learn about $CLNE, I would recommend reading  the original DD from several weeks ago. There have been a couple of other good ones on here this week too. Here are some basics about the company that doesn't include the cocaine laden rants that most DD's are filled with. I've been chipping away at buying shares for weeks during this $8 strangle hold.

IN short, CLNE takes Methane from waste sources like the dairy industry and landfills, captures it and converts it into (RNG) renewable natural gas, stores it, and then sells it. Their market focus is on selling to heavy transport/trucking and they position their infrastructure accordingly. 

* **Majorly superior to EV for this application for a few reasons.... Namely because it's faster to fill with RNG than to charge (time is money), batteries for EV's are super heavy (weight is money), and maintenance is the same as a standard engine (money is money).**
* CLNE already has huge partnership with the likes of Total, BP, Chevron, LA mass transit, and **Amazon.**
* **Amazon, as a part of their deal with CLNE, has the right to purchase tons of shares at the $13 price level. The price being the same  as the squeeze is coincidence.**
* CLNE has been building their infrastructure out (stations, etc) with this in mind, purposely constructing them near Amazon warehouse/shipping centers. 
* Other common carriers have already started purchasing/converting fleets to RNG
* Recently, California ports have started offering programs/subsidies to trucks that run RNG - part of their efforts to reduce emissions at the ports, improve air quality, and help the environment.
* &#x200B;

Product, infrastructure, sales, partnerships.... What is it missing? Volume. Various shorts have been beating it down for months and some restructuring by Total as well (they still own almost 50 million shares, don't worry). Buy shares, hold shares, rake tendies.

The June gamma play is still in play, and very possible. Tons of posts about it and most of them are on point with their potential. Some hype, some cocaine mixed in, but most good hearted. Cow farts and all else aside, I like the stock and believe it to be a solid hold with a 2x - 3x price potential and an obvious call options run.

&#x200B;

^(I am a 895 share holder before today, bought 105 more to even out 1,000. I will hold through the year at a minimum, probably longer.)

Based on the market cap of 1.86B @ 9.31, there are approximately 200M shares. If Total owns 50M (25%), that is substantial and definitely plays into value. Could this be cause for concern?



Also why are we thinking gamma squeeze? The stock only has 5% shorted at the moment (~10.8M shares). Forgive my absolute smooth brain for not figuring this out, but I can't decipher why there would be a squaz with that small of float."

2021-06-05 13:18:22,wallstreetbets,"All they need to do is dump it to 12.99 to keep those calls OTM, right?  That's still upside from current stock price -- and that's just a 13 day horizon.  If it gets over 13, then there's even more upside for 2 weeks.

Short interest is increasing.  Covering those is going to put buying pressure too.

Squeeze aside, there are a lot of significant factors in the original DD that makes me feel that the stock is worth more than current levels.

This isn't financial advice.. just me explaining my rational why I am in this stock."
2021-06-05 18:53:03,wallstreetbets,"i say, now there's no interest for tutes to drive SP down - tutes like to hold shares and for long time... on the other hand HF's might borrow shares if tutes will loan 'em out at a what could be a very high fee if CLNE will catch the meme wave...."

 As for for tesla. How widespread are they? And they are not designed for long haul transport. They are far too heavy for long haul use and lack the infrastructure to support long hauls. Besides the fact that they were moving into that space with autonomous driving plans which are not planning out well."

2021-06-05 14:06:28,wallstreetbets,Stage 1 cycle maybe. Gotta look at the charts. That’s the time to buy.
2021-06-05 18:11:44,wallstreetbets,It’s the same chart as X
2021-06-05 11:19:52,wallstreetbets,Just sell a matching qty of July 2nd calls $1 about the strike price. Close both at the same time. It should have a negative theta decay until expiration. Also won't experience theta crush since the sold calls will counteract

2021-06-05 11:33:54,wallstreetbets,"But what about MVIS?  
I got MVIS because that big broker stopped allowing shorts on GME, AMC, and MVIS, and I already had GME and AMC."
2021-06-04 20:03:09,wallstreetbets,"AMC or GME is the only play right now if you’re looking for an actual short squeeze. The DD tells the story, Fintel has AMC listed as a 99.93% chance for a squeeze to happen, and major lending institutions have blacklisted the shorting of both of these stocks out of fear that the risk on their end will be too high. That should tell you something. I’m not saying BB can’t get to that point eventually and I haven’t done nearly enough DD on it or GME to be honest to be certain, but I am certain that if we apply the pressure to AMC or GME one of those will pop tf off. Seeing as GME is a little steep of a buy in I feel AMC is the best play but if we keep dividing between every potential squeeze opportunity we actually end up losing in the end. Pennies is all we get with that. AMC just had a tasty dip for Monday and as it’s the only heavily shorted stock that I’ve done a shit load of DD on  so of course I’m biased but this one is ready to moon and it’s still cheap."

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CRSR huge volume breakout, buy wall stalemate. Shorts getting desperate to hold it under $35 to protect 6/18 options. Bear F#ck train is ready to leave the station. YO if you haven't looked at this stock yet, its time to open your eyes. CRSR investors have been watching this roll out for the last 6 months while getting strangle-boned by some big bears.

I wrote a pretty detailed DD on Corsair yesterday and the institutional investor shenanigans that have been going on with it [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrldny/crsr\_about\_to\_break\_through\_its\_3\_month\_sideways/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrldny/crsr_about_to_break_through_its_3_month_sideways/)

TL;DR, Corsair is probably one of the most undervalued and manipulated high growth stocks on the market right now. Yea yea many apes say this about a stock...but this one is clear as day with even a cursory look at the history, fundamentals and trading patterns.  It's being held down by short sellers and swing traders profiting off of the extremely low float/low volume.

It has incredible fundamentals in an exploding industry, with rapid growth, increasing profitability, and a massive earnings beat. Nearly the entire tech sector market has outperformed CRSR on technicals, and the price has continued to trade sideways for months, Why?

The only bear case is a bunch of boomers saying computer usage will magically disappear after the pandemic lifts (of course ignoring the fact that 2/3 of the workforce is going partial or full time remote)

It's because they can tank the price with intraday shorts since the volume is so low. And they have been writing millions in call options at $35 and $40 through EOY.

Here's the pattern they're using.... Run stock up to \~$35, increasing options premiums. Write tons of $35C, collect premiums, sell tons of shares (either short or actual), price tanks to $31. They re-purchase / cover shorts at $31... drive options premiums back up... rinse and repeat.

Today, we're seeing something pretty wild happening.

# After Hours Shenanigans

Big money investors have been playing this stock like a puppet. Last night is a prime example. After a week-long run... some big pocket investors managed to instantly tank the price 6% after-hours on very little volume.

https://preview.redd.it/axa93ypdla371.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=da1039fceba3f44a4dca6b22704629910f45a7b3

These sorts of shenanigans have been par for the course with this stock. After the insta-tank...someone unloaded hundreds of thousands of shares at market open this AM to keep the price down.

Throughout the day, despite big relative trading volume, the price has traded sideways. Why?

What it looks like is aside from big intraday short activity, the big boys are desperate to keep the price under $35. Why? Because they have tens of millions of $ in  $35C and $40C stacked up through the end of year

https://preview.redd.it/pv34llb7ja371.png?width=992&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf299139407598b777482ab67345abefa0da002

Market forces are TRYING to push this stock up, while whales are doing everything they can to puppet it down.

# Buy Pressure Stalemate

As it stands, buy pressure is nearly double sell side. Drilling down into Level 2, we've seen big buy walls supporting above the $31.5 break even and holding strong.

https://preview.redd.it/6j2k90zhja371.png?width=1883&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1978500195ad12a1e1c8db99914bd23cee8a0b2

The price is sitting on a solid floor in a stalemate.  This stock is literally trading on sale, primed and waiting for some retail momentum to take off.

# The Play

Buying shares and long calls. If this thing takes off and holds past $35 strike by 6/18, its going to moon BIG.

This stock makes huge swings on very little volume. With even a modest uptick in buy volume, its going to make a run. More shares need to change into retail hands.

All of the fundamentals are there. There is absolutley no reason for the current trading pattern other than scratch-deep market manipulation.

Positions:

2021-06-05 03:34:05,wallstreetbets,"Options provide leverage. If I can pay $1 for a call and a stock moves $5 up, I spent $100 to capture a $500 move. I'd need to buy 100 shares to capture the same upside. For a $50 stock, that's $5k to capture a $500 profit or 10% return.

Meanwhile that call might triple price, capturing a 300% return. Options leverage allows you to make or lose significantly more.

I recently bought 150 $10 strike calls on PBR. I've made $16k this past week or so as that stock went up on about $4k - $5k in calls.

I'd need 15000 shares or around $150k in shares to capture that same upside.

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ARRY: Super undervalued solar play with low IV, low premium options! COMPANY INTRO:

Array, $ARRY is a solar systems company that was founded in 1989 and IPO’d on October 15, 2020 and currently has a market cap of 2B. Array makes money by selling mounting/tracking systems for big solar production plants that increase efficiency by tracking the sun allowing the panels to absorb more energy. This video from Array shows their systems well:

[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nhDWaT5MjVA](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nhDWaT5MjVA)

GROWTH:

Yearly:

Revenue: 2018: $290M 2019: $648M (+123% YoY) 2020: $873M (+35% YoY)

Net income: 2018: -$61M 2019: $40M 2020: $59M (+48% YoY)

Quarterly:

Revenue: Q3 2020: $139M Q4 2020: $180M (+29% QoQ) Q1 2021: $245M (+36% QoQ)

Net Income: Q3 2020: -$7M Q4 2020: -$2M Q1 2021: 3M

Good growth numbers on everything except the latest QoQ net income (will get to later).

Now on to the growth of solar as a sector, specifically on utility production (not residential/personal) because Array’s consumers are only in the utility sector. Array has 12% market share of the solar tracking systems. The growth of the solar utility sector directly influences the growth of Array. Solar been quickly rising over the last decade as cost of solar technology decreased significantly over that time period. Solar energy is now cheaper to produce than coal, natural gas and nuclear as of 2020. Energy production and utility companies will follow the money and continue to build solar plants to capitalize on this opportunity.

US Solar Production from Utility (GWh) 2011: 1,800 2012: 4,300 (+138%) 2013: 9,200 (+114%) 2014: 18,300 (+99%) 2015: 26,500 (+45%) 2016: 36,700 (+38%) 2017: 53,000 (+44%) 2018: 66,600 (+26%) 2019: 72,200 (+9%) 2020: 90,900 (+26%) Source: United States Department of Energy

Solar accounted for 2.3% of total energy production in 2020. Obviously plenty of room to grow. Coal, Natural gas and Nuclear combined for 80% of total US electricity production in 2020. Now that solar is the cheapest energy source I expect it to take a large portion of that pie, maybe 25% or more in the next 10-15 years would be my guess. The only thing holding solar back is that the power grids in the US are build only to directly transport electricity from the source to its destination. So there is no element of the grid designed to store electricity. This has not been an issue in the past bc coal, nuclear, natural gas and even hydro produce energy 24/7. Obviously Solar can only produce in the day. The solution to this issue is large, utility scale electric storage. The exact kind provided by Tesla. These storage systems will provide necessary liquidity and versatility to the grid with solar production. The Lithium Ion batteries in these storage systems are rapidly decreasing in price. Prices of Li-Ion batteries have dropped 90% in the last decade. As it becomes more appealing for Tesla and other companies to construct these storage systems and start providing more utility scale electricity storage, more utility companies will invest in solar rigs. It will be more profitable to produce and won’t be held back by the limitations of old grid infrastructure.

Good video by CNBC on the Grid, Storage systems, and the growth of solar utility production:

UNDERVALUED:

In the first few months after IPO Array’s price held around the low $40’s, hitting a high of $53.99. In late January until now the stock has sold off significantly. There are 3 main reasons for this and why the concerns are irrelevant in the long term.

1. Broader market tech/growth sell off due to inflation FUD. I’m not going to try to predict if inflation will stay, shoot up, or go back down to relatively normal levels but there is one think I know for sure. Tech/growth is cheaper now. Barring hyperinflation and or a depression, this dip gives long term investors a good buying opportunity.
2. Tax credit changes hurt YoY revenue. ITC is a federal tax credit that allows people or businesses to right off x% of the cost they spent on solar (and directly related related systems/expenses) on their income tax. This % was 30% up to the end of 2019. Then it is lowered to 26% from 2020-2022, then to 22% in 2023, then 2024+ to 0% for residential and 10% for commercial utility and scale. The fact that there is still a 10% tax creditor the foreseeable future is great. And it doesn’t matter that residential dropped to 0% because Array doesn’t operate in that market. So why would this Tax Credit be bad? Well going back to the top of the post under Quarterly net income I said I would get to later. Q1 2020 was a great Q for array and their revenue. Revenue or that quarter was $438M, compared to the total yearly revenue in 2019 of $650M. Sense that great quarter. Revenue has dropped significantly. And now because YoY of the last Q report is compared to that breakout Q, it makes this Q and YoY growth look really bad. I believe that Q1 2020 revenue was drastically and temporary inflated because of an element of the ITC tax credit. There is a way that constructing solar systems can grab on and hold on to the higher 30% credit from 2019 even if they don’t finish construction before 2020. It is called safe haven. Basically if construction is started and there is a continuous effort made to complete construction and as long as that construction is finished within 4 years, the business will receive the 30% tax credit. In this quarters earnings report, when referring to the 44% decrease in YoY revenue, Array’s CEO said “Results were lower to last year because of the unseasonably high high volume of shipments we had in the first Q 2020 to consumers that were safe harboring tracker systems in connection with the ITC step down” So it seems clear that Array was flooded with orders late 2019 to take advantage of the safe harbor and those revenues showed up on Q1 2020 financials. So even though the YoY revenue from last earnings was bad I believe that the order flow Array is getting was inflated in Q1 2020 and is now deflated because of all the businesses that would be buying trackers now, but bought them earlier because they wanted the better tax credits. I can see this cycle of inflated and deflated order flow/revenue relative to the decreases in ITC tax credits continue until 2024 when the credit stabilizes at 10%. I believe bad YoY data is just a distraction from great long term growth and creates a great buying opportunity.
3. Supply chain FUD and one time stock based compensation hurt profits. Rapid increase in the price of raw materials, goods and even cost of transporting those goods going up. Supply chain FUD has stacked on top of inflation FUD sense late February until last earnings and has caused a substantial sell off in Array stock. This Supply chain FUD was realized in last quarters earnings (Q1 2021) when profitably/margins sank because cost of goods shot through the roof. “This industry (solar tracking) is contending with increase in steel and shipping costs that are unprecedented in both magnitude and the rate of change.” - Jim Fusaro, Array CEO in Q1 2021 report. YoY the cost of steel has more than doubled Steel represents the almost half of Array’s cost of goods sold so it’s extreme increase in price has an large impact on the bottom line. Shipping costs have also shot up significantly and have the same effect on the bottom line. Even though revenue in Q1 2020 was $438M and revenue Q1 2021 was $246M, operating costs were higher in this Q large due to one time expense that come with becoming a public company. This includes increase in equity based compensation and costs related to common stock. This is simply a short term expense that negatively impacted this Q earnings and will have no further impact on profits/margins. Array is taking action to secure long term contracts with freight providers and fixing commodity prices with suppliers. This action from array combined with the fact that ridiculous prices of shipping and materials will drop in the next year or two as supply meets demand thanks to capitalism. This Supply chain FUD and bad profitability/margin data from last quarter I believe will also have no impact on future growth long term and only creates a good buying opportunity.

2021-06-05 12:06:59,wallstreetbets,"They just merged with APHRIA (another week co) and they now are one of the largest cannabis distributors in the world. Imo it was a really smart merger cuz APHRIA has really diverse product to market pipelines whereas Tilray is a big player in production but losses alot of money to middle men in distribution of their product as far as getting it to the consumer. Also they currently make up 17% of the market share of weed in Canada and are aiming to have 30% market share by 2025 (although analysts expect a more modest 22-28%) still tho with the industry growing 30% yoy that's a good amount to have and with cutting costs buy merging and getting a level furthur down the distribution pipeline and closer to consumers I think they are in for some great earnings over the next 1-2 years. Also there is alot of focus on the US market (hence the pop up this week with Amazon comming out as in support of federal legalization through the MORE act) but they also are a major player in the European market, where they just made a deal with one of the biggest pharmacy chains to act as a distributor for their medical bud, which again removes a layer of middle men they used to go through (independent wholesalers) and cuts their costs significantly in a fast growing market or tightly packed liberal European countries where legalization is imminent."

2021-06-05 11:10:33,wallstreetbets,"I have been in....so glad I bought the DIP.

In terms of shares....I am in for the BO"
2021-06-05 01:45:48,wallstreetbets,MVIS will hit 60$ next week
2021-06-04 21:54:00,wallstreetbets,bro how did you get dark mode? lol
2021-06-05 15:03:09,wallstreetbets,I have been in for a long time and bought on the dip. I think we have a huge week !! Keep holding if you ask me
2021-06-04 23:48:03,wallstreetbets,Soooo… how did this work out for you. Genuinely curious
2021-06-04 23:50:55,wallstreetbets,Mvis was going up before that
2021-06-05 11:22:38,wallstreetbets,Forgive my ignorance. I have the rumors about the Microsoft buyout. And heard someone ripped apart a set of those fancy 3d goggles Microsoft has.    Can you point me in the direction of the DD that sold you?
2021-06-05 01:54:18,wallstreetbets,I really hope so.  I have 1000 shares and ITM leaps.
2021-06-05 11:20:26,wallstreetbets,You have to get one of those letters telling you that you are a retard and lost almost all of your money.  And maybe you should ever trade a stock yourself.   Written in invisible ink is a game genie codes for dark mode.
2021-06-05 00:23:42,wallstreetbets,I ended up being up insane numbers. And it dropped I guess tda closes out option contracts automatically 30 minutes before closing bell assuming you forgot.   I went go sell at the new peak and realized they had already done it.   I ended up breaking even but I should have made out with about 100k in profit.
2021-06-05 02:03:36,wallstreetbets,"It’s trending that direction but If it hit 30 it would be nice as well, volume is lacking."
2021-06-05 02:03:59,wallstreetbets,It has tons of support though
2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Stop bringing up NOK. It’s not going to do anything. Want to know what NOK is going to do? Nothing. Look at what it’s done since 2012. It’s flat. Ridiculously low volatility. 0.62% short float according to Finviz. And a market cap of over 30 billion. Good luck getting that to budge. So tell me, why is it suddenly going to moon after nearly 10 years of doing nothing?  5G? That’s existed for years now. It isn’t new anymore. The contracts have been awarded and that cash flow is priced in. Sorry, it’s not a bad company but the people who are pushing it are only doing so because they think nostalgia will make people pile into it. Which even if they do, *it still won’t do anything because there is no short float and the company is already huge*.  Put your money elsewhere and stop distracting from real plays."
2021-06-04 21:00:56,wallstreetbets,It’s up 41% in the past 3 months genius
2021-06-04 22:34:10,wallstreetbets,So ... NOK calls $10 6/18? That's what I heard when I read this
2021-06-04 20:16:08,wallstreetbets,I sold my NOK shares yesterday. You've convinced me to buy back in.
2021-06-05 00:02:41,wallstreetbets,Stfu retard. You know what else has been flat forever? GME.
2021-06-04 20:12:19,wallstreetbets,I own NOK because I am retarded. Gorilla like green.
2021-06-04 23:38:44,wallstreetbets,"Sounds good

Put in a order for more nok"
2021-06-05 00:56:23,wallstreetbets,"You might want to do some research, we haven't even scratched the surface of what 5g can do.  Its going to replace wifi and SO MUCH MORE. Do some research on just 5g never mind Nokia and you will be buying in on Monday.  Its good that you have an opinion it would just be better if you stuck to eating crayons than to let your warped mind give you DD... now go eat another crayon fellow retard"
2021-06-05 04:15:55,wallstreetbets,"Dude what you talking about, my long options calls are 105% up. Bought it about a week ago."
2021-06-05 04:31:44,wallstreetbets,"They still let 🐻🐻🐻 filibuster in here?


Position or ban bish."
2021-06-04 22:45:40,wallstreetbets,"Nok is the company that is set to make the biggest profit off of 5G and huawei is being kicked tonthebcurb by western companies, so that is all nok clay now.

You are wrong."
2021-06-04 21:07:27,wallstreetbets,Nokia is a value play and galaxy brained people put their profits in it.
2021-06-05 02:58:41,wallstreetbets,"NOK is a good long hold, it got caught up with meme stocks because there was a few good DD posts about it when GME took off, and everyone flooded to WSB. In that DD it was still considered a long hold though, people need to remember that. I'm happy holding NOK right now with the slight gain I've gotten. I wouldn't invest anything extra into it, but it's still a good stock to be long on."
2021-06-05 11:43:06,wallstreetbets,Ive made $17.49 in the last month off NOK. You can take your financial advice and shove it up your opinion. PAL!!!
2021-06-04 23:24:40,wallstreetbets,Buying more NOK Monday
2021-06-05 02:11:43,wallstreetbets,So ape buy NOK? Is what your saying🤙
2021-06-04 20:53:57,wallstreetbets,I have NOK calls go to bed
2021-06-04 21:31:38,wallstreetbets,We all know you work for Ericsson.
2021-06-04 22:29:42,wallstreetbets,Is butter a carb?
2021-06-04 22:38:46,wallstreetbets,That’s the whole point monkey. Else we’d be pushing TSLA.
2021-06-04 23:30:55,wallstreetbets,"Yes, because it going from 3 to 10 was nothing. Imagine being a tinfoil hatter thinking every stock is taking away from ""the real stock"", i.e., the stock you're in. lul"
2021-06-05 04:47:07,wallstreetbets,You just brought it up lmao
2021-06-04 21:25:55,wallstreetbets,Idk people said the same thing about silver and that was a very hot play in the past month until GME and AMC started going up since last week
2021-06-04 22:30:03,wallstreetbets,my NOK leaps have been printing almost daily and some of my 2023 calls are up 600%. I think its a solid play but dont think its gonna squeeze. Why are you so salty OP?
2021-06-05 00:46:43,wallstreetbets,Thanks. This is what I needed to move on.
2021-06-05 03:18:44,wallstreetbets,100 years later.. NOK will still bea  $4 stock
2021-06-05 05:22:03,wallstreetbets,Nok got 5.6 bil shares. It is a boring company. It just flatline for years and even going lower. Best to stay away.
2021-06-04 20:46:51,wallstreetbets,"You’re wrong, 100% - it wouldn’t be holding the price it is currently if it wasn’t. It’s respected every resistance level, and it’s heavily shorted. The fact that it’s brought up a lot means it will be shorted likely worse in the somewhat near future."
2021-06-04 22:18:11,wallstreetbets,"Anybody who thinks they'll strike it rich with Nokia is a dummy. 

&#x200B;

NOK is all about buying a bunch of shares and selling covered calls to speculators who haven't figured out it never moves. 

Seriously, it's probably my favorite stock. It's like clockwork. Write covered calls, buy more shares, write more covered calls...."
2021-06-04 21:30:35,wallstreetbets,Why do we keep seeing only BB on WSB and not GME or AMC?
2021-06-04 22:27:35,wallstreetbets,"NOK to the 🌕!!! And by moon, I mean +0.20 cents by 2023"
2021-06-05 05:58:23,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, get into GEVO instead 😂"
2021-06-05 07:31:06,wallstreetbets,"Stop trying to make “fetch” a thing, Gretchen!"
2021-06-05 08:07:54,wallstreetbets,OP works for Ericsson
2021-06-05 11:13:00,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, I bought  1000 shares at $3.90. Up 40.5%. My only regret is not buying more"
2021-06-05 11:18:52,wallstreetbets,So pick up some ccs? Gotcha
2021-06-05 12:39:26,wallstreetbets,"Some people believe that if you convince enough idiots to buy and then you, the mastermind, sell...

Nope. Your posts on WSB do nothing to volume."
2021-06-05 12:46:57,wallstreetbets,NOK is basically the opposite of $CLOV
2021-06-05 13:21:39,wallstreetbets,I come from the future and NOK it’s worth 420 dollars per share in 2022 .![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)
2021-06-04 22:27:30,wallstreetbets,How about we all focus on the one that was actually running this week - AMC - instead of bitch ass BlackBerry. You guys truly are retarded.
2021-06-04 20:44:43,wallstreetbets,Oh ok. BB AMC and GameStop! 🙌💎🚀
2021-06-04 21:44:25,wallstreetbets,Hold on....am I  supposed be making money? I just keeping buying the dip...thought someone else was bringing the banna chips...isn't this the monkey pitch in?
2021-06-04 21:46:30,wallstreetbets,#BBBY
2021-06-05 02:42:22,wallstreetbets,You mean the investment advice was not good here?!
2021-06-05 03:16:50,wallstreetbets,HAHA... now finally the a smooth ape that has some real sense..  You guys realized you all been had by the Hedge funds
2021-06-04 21:21:25,wallstreetbets,"I assume he's referring to the amount of posts calling for a squeeze or rocketing up or other dumb as fuck hype trains. If you haven't been here longer than GME or AMC relevancy NOK has been tagged DD to shoot the moon hundreds of times. Its a solid company with growth but it isn't the next lottery ticket like people keep claiming it to be.

Its basically the less amusing Josh Gordon hype train of WSB lol"
2021-06-05 02:53:52,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been saying I think it’s hitting 6 in a year or two, and if thats the worst is does I’m good."
2021-06-04 21:02:53,wallstreetbets,"But without Nokia, the B.A.N.G. meme stocks would just be BAG instead...

Oh wait..."
2021-06-04 21:06:36,wallstreetbets,"Workhorse currently has a 42% short float which could cause a short squeeze. The support is around $13.00 with bulls still in control of the chart. This is similar to AMC because the higher the short interest the higher the squeeze will go. For example, shorts borrow shares from a broker for a fee. This is possible because people buy shares and don’t set limit orders. This is why it is important to set limit orders high so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. The shorts then sell your shares that they just borrowed for a fee to then sell on the open market driving the price down. Shorts make money by selling the shares back to the broker at a lower price as well as making money through buying put options. A short squeeze happens when shorts have to buy back their shares that they borrowed from a broker at a higher price. We can accelerate a short squeeze through buying the shares and setting a limit order high above the ask so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. This will cause the stock price to go up which will cause shorts to buy back the shares that they borrowed causing a “short squeeze”. For example, if we buy WKHS at “market price”, such as $13.00, it will cause the stock price to go up at which point shorts will need to cover their positions or risk being margin called which means that the broker can automatically close out the short’s position which will cause them to buy back those shares at “market price” which is often much higher then when they borrowed them which causes the shorts to lose their money by handing it over us as we sell our shares when the price is above $100/share. 🐎"
2021-06-05 14:31:02,wallstreetbets,"From one drunken idiot, to another, I salute you!"
2021-06-04 22:14:26,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-06-04 22:56:56,wallstreetbets,Wash sale FTW
2021-06-04 22:50:26,wallstreetbets,I’m supposed to do the opposite of WSB. Do I do the opposite of what I said or what this guy said? 🧐
2021-06-05 02:05:05,wallstreetbets,"Now this,this comment right here shows what wsb is all about![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)"
2021-06-05 00:04:49,wallstreetbets,Big difference between 140% short float and 0.62% 🤡
2021-06-05 17:56:12,wallstreetbets,"My $7 Jan LEAPS are up 65% in two weeks,  no complaints here either"
2021-06-04 20:08:06,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow, a whole $500! You are practically ready to retire!"
2021-06-04 20:07:59,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow, a whole $500! You are practically ready to retire!"
2021-06-04 22:08:15,wallstreetbets,Well considering NOK bulls are squealing about how it’s about to moon and they only come out when meme stocks are squeezing then yes I think it’s a fair statement to criticize them for thinking a company with a 30 billion market cap and no short float is going to squeeze.
2021-06-05 02:36:34,wallstreetbets,"Or the fact that the United States is really far behind in 5G compared to rest of the world and they will be using Nokia in lots of contracts to provide the country with 5G. OP Says 5G is not new technology but in the US it still is. Also pretty much every telephone network in the US will be having co tracts with Nokia (AT&T, DISH, T-Mobile, Verizon) are some of the companies listed in their site

2021-06-04 20:23:24,wallstreetbets,Well said
2021-06-05 01:00:54,wallstreetbets,Where did I say 5G was worthless or couldn’t do any of things?  You’re acting like 5G hasn’t been developed yet and contracts don’t exist for its infrastructure build out. Might I suggest crayons for dinner?  Granny Smith Apple is delicious and a personal favorite of mine
2021-06-04 22:47:13,wallstreetbets,Great. If you believe it then buy and hold long. I just want NOK bulls to stop coming out of the shadows to try and get people to push a short squeeze on a stock with a 30 billion market cap and no float whenever the meme stocks are squeezing. It’s a distraction.
2021-06-04 21:10:04,wallstreetbets,"This. I picked up xxx shares at 4 and change expecting to hold a few years. 

Do I expect it to jump to 100k a share? No. Do I expect to see it up to 15 a share, that would def be nice. 

Less nerve wracking than my spy weeklies."
2021-06-04 20:03:49,wallstreetbets,"This is me with Ford $$F and Caesar Entertainment $$CZR.   Up 38% on each.  As someone with half their portfolio in GME, having these to fall back on so i'm not completely loss is quite nice."
2021-06-04 22:11:19,wallstreetbets,And if you bought in just about any year before 2020 then you’re still down.  Acting like you bought this great stock because it tanked in 2019 and rebounded (like EVERYTHING did with Covid) doesn’t make it a great stock. It just did what everything else did and it STILL isn’t even where it was in 2019.
2021-06-05 14:30:59,wallstreetbets,I was just DESTROYED with LOGIC and FACTS
2021-06-05 11:06:06,wallstreetbets,Same

2021-06-04 22:35:08,wallstreetbets,It’s a fruit
2021-06-04 22:34:24,wallstreetbets,"Not salty it’s just annoying when people think it’s going to moon. NOK seemingly starts popping up nonstop when all the meme stocks are squeezing. It’s not because people think it “has great fundamentals” or is a growth story.  They’re doing it because they think it will squeeze. If people want to hold it as an investment, that’s fine. I think it’s a poor one but that’s on them. More then anything I want them to stop spamming about an impending short squeeze that will not happen and taking volume away from other plays."
2021-06-04 21:08:37,wallstreetbets,I’m long NOK but you’re incorrect I believe. Short interest is very low. Under one percent.
2021-06-04 22:28:33,wallstreetbets,This is very wrong. Nokia has no short interest
2021-06-04 22:19:42,wallstreetbets,They don’t get it. They’ll find out in ten years when it’s still 5.50 per share. Or maybe they’ll still be screaming “it’s about to rise!!!”
2021-06-05 03:22:16,wallstreetbets,"I find the overwhelming BB spam to be a really weird occurrence during the last week. I understand that all the memestocks were kinda running. I assumed that AMC would've been the real hot topic here, but all of a sudden BB comes out of nowhere and literally dominates all discussion in WSB... its disconcerting"
2021-06-05 12:27:33,wallstreetbets,Indeed suspicious to me.
2021-06-04 22:35:22,wallstreetbets,Woahhh don’t get ahead of yourself!
2021-06-04 22:36:30,wallstreetbets,Yes exactly. But at least BB has a setup that can squeeze. NOK bulls come out of the woodwork every time meme stocks start squeezing and pretend that their non-shorted 30 billion dollar company is going to moon.
2021-06-04 22:38:51,wallstreetbets,"This. I disagree with even holding it as an investment but if you want to then great. But let’s get real here, NOK bulls come out of the shadows every time meme stocks squeeze and claim they’re going to moon. That’s what I really have a problem with. It’s a huge company with no short float. Its not going to squeeze ever. It’s just a distraction."
2021-06-05 00:14:26,wallstreetbets,"I don't want a fucking lottery ticket, that's for dumbass poors who can't do math, I want to make money. NOK gains sitting around 30% right now :)"

2021-06-04 23:09:53,wallstreetbets,"Yes (so, no)"
2021-06-05 08:19:58,wallstreetbets,That is correct.
2021-06-05 00:08:09,wallstreetbets,I’m not saying that NOK is going to do anything. But saying it’s flat means absolutely nothing.
2021-06-04 20:12:12,wallstreetbets,I’m getting bag holder vibes from you my guy. Hope everything is okay at home.
2021-06-05 13:09:45,wallstreetbets,It’s so annoying. Every post now screeching about short squeezes. Don’t get me wrong it’s been & continues to be fun … but some stocks may also provide gains based on value & or growth? $Nok provides an excellent opportunity with both.
2021-06-04 22:51:56,wallstreetbets,"By short squeeze?  Exactly where it’s at now. It can’t squeeze. There is no short float. Outside of that, in the long-term, it just depends on their execution and the markets they choose to be in."

2021-06-05 01:56:40,wallstreetbets,I already ate my crayons...its all I eat... what you did say was 5g isn't new anymore.  And what I said was we haven't even scratched the surface of 5g so... RESEARCH and your retarded brain will see that in fact 5g is still 90 untouched of what it is capable of ... so I guess you're right it's not new because we haven't started to do what its capable of.  Now you've gone and made me hungry for a green crayon and I'm all out of green ones
2021-06-04 23:28:57,wallstreetbets,I do have long positions already since 3 dollars. I don't believe in a short squeeze though. I just like the stock.

2021-06-05 12:50:36,wallstreetbets,I could hire a firm in the Philippines to spam a forum. Hypothetically
2021-06-05 00:02:43,wallstreetbets,Why do you keep saying this over and over again?   Who cares what other idiots invest in?
2021-06-05 08:37:22,wallstreetbets,"I don't recall people saying it was going to squeeze. Most of what I've seen has been more that it's an undervalued company with big things in the future. 

Not everything is a short squeeze play. Some people are just idiots and think everything posted here is a short squeeze. 

But, on the bullish side of nok, I remember hearing that they plan on doing share buy backs, so that will undiluted the float, and raise the value of the stock as well. Nok may actually be a decent long term play, but that's for individuals to decide on their own."
2021-06-05 00:01:15,wallstreetbets,The one thing I’m not clear on is if this is a distraction or not
2021-06-05 02:57:23,wallstreetbets,"NOK to $6...like I’m not expecting the moon...

2021-06-04 22:09:53,wallstreetbets,"Dude your obsession with a multi year stock chart and complete disinterest in actually learning about the entire restructuring of the company’s business model is astounding. You’re talking shit and are too lazy to even get your facts straight. If I took your approach, I would have never made plays on GameStop because it’s multi year chart was literally a decade of death.

2021-06-05 00:55:16,wallstreetbets,My point was going to be about the massive share float. I didn’t say anything about a squeeze.
2021-06-04 22:16:53,wallstreetbets,Apparently you’ve only been trading for a hot minute because even with that “OMG 40% gain!!” It’s still below where it was in 2019. Which is hilarious since the rest of the stock market has blown through 2019 levels. And if you bought this in 2011 you would be down 1.83% over that time frame. And down 5% over the past 5 years.

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Suggested by ""Betting Resource"", s sports handicapping service. HE says its for entertainment and education purpose only. BUT all his suggestes have mademe good money.  They have made some great plays on BB and other and this should cash. He expects 500 to 1000% gains with these if you get out at the right time around next two weeks.

Below is the small portion of the explanation in the email. If you get these puts, you should be able to cash in big profit when the dumping happens even before the strike price hits. You may have to pay little extra for DASH since the dumping started early and it didn't climb up but you might still be able to get them before today's close.

*These are short term plays but wouldn't consider this a high risk lotto. These are medium risk plays with good chance to finish in money. Remember that the strike prize doesn't have to hit--when there is a rapid dump, price of the contracts will go up and you can let go. Ideally you want take some extra positions so that you can sell half the positions when the price of contract triples or quadruples during dump then hold the other close to expiry.*

*ABNB and DASH will dump starting Monday with lock up expiry for DASH on June 7th and ABNB on June 8th. Little over 51 million shares will be eligible for selling which was valued 3.5 billion at the ipo price of $68. These insider will start selling and take profit as long as the lock up period ends. Won't happen enough but the volume will be enough to push the price below 130 by June 18th. When the rapid dump happens, even before the strike hits, you should be able to take good profit. Similarly for DASH 33 million shares will be eligible for sale with a value of around 3 billion at the ipo price of $102. Dash should break below 120 and threaten previous low of around $110.*"

Nupur Acharya and Youkyung Lee

**Thu, June 3, 2021, 7:58 PM**

**AMC**

(Bloomberg) -- Retail investors in India and South Korea have joined the meme-stock frenzy by piling into **AMC** Entertainment Holdings Inc. through local trading platforms giving them access to U.S. markets.

The money-losing movie-theater chain is among the five most-traded U.S. stocks over the past week on both Vested Finance and Stockal, two India-focused platforms for retail investors to buy U.S. equities. **AMC** Entertainment has accounted for 14% of trades on Vested this week, a greater proportion than Tesla Inc., Shopify Inc. and Facebook Inc.

**AMC** Entertainment closed 18% lower on Thursday after soaring 95% on Wednesday. Its dizzying surge in the past few weeks has pushed its market capitalization briefly above $33 billion. The craze for so-called meme shares such as **AMC** and GameStop Corp. is being fueled by pandemic-led lockdowns and low-fee trading plans that have encouraged new investors into global share markets.

“Due to social media platforms like Reddit, information today travels quickly across borders and an Indian investor is as plugged into the U.S. markets as their counterparts in the U.S.,” said Viram Shah, chief executive officer at Vested in Mumbai. “Some retail Indian investors are driven by news and want to be part of any global trends or movements.”

Sitashwa Srivastava, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of Stockal, said that in the last three to five months, “people have been chasing high volatility stocks a lot more. GameStop happened, and now, AMC is of great interest.”

**Korean Favorite**

Korean investors snapped up $225 million of **AMC** shares from Monday through Thursday, according to Korea Securities Depository data. That total is getting close to three times the amount spent on the second-most-purchased counter, Tesla, at $82 million.

A popular online forum among Korean retail investors contained dozens of posts from traders known locally as “ants,” discussing the prospects for **AMC** stock prices, and whether Blackberry Ltd. might replace AMC as the next meme target.

!! This is undiscovered NEWS so far !!

*The masses have not discovered this yet, so be fast!*

*This is not a financial advice.*

[The presentation was released and soon after this happened. Take into account that this is not news so far. There hasn't been mass coverage yet.](https://preview.redd.it/amwkymr4ea371.png?width=1753&format=png&auto=webp&s=de5a97b0c3941fcadd08846d9114d7f1e34f8083)

In brief: Nano Dimension (NNDM) creates machines that manufacture Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) with 3D printing technology. They have acquired Nano Fabrica which specializes in 3D printed mechanical components, and Deep Cube which specializes in Machine Learning, with the intention of making production of any product quicker, more efficient, and more precise. Deep Cube has collaborated with **AMD**.

In this presentation it is clear that Nano Dimension is collaborating with **NVIDIA** and **Neuralink** \- the **Elon Musk** singularity pursuit.

**This company and their technology is the future and at the same time** **speculative.**

1. 3D Nano Technology. If you haven't read the **Three Body Problem** book series, praised by Obama and the likes, please do. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Three-Body\_Problem\_(novel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel))
2. This technology is, frankly, the next step in humankinds technological advancement. It's still cocooning but NNDM is taking it forwards.
3. The company is based in Israel - a lot of fuckery in there in the past months -  but things seem to be getting better now.

[Since the All Time High - NNDM has acquired 2 companies, has increased their cash to +1B and has developed their technology even further and revealed some big name customers of theirs. Still the price is $10 less than when it was a more speculative stock.](https://preview.redd.it/hketqhsega371.png?width=1755&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea0dd7cae930fc9a3cc2781ba77c8460e4fc4a5)

**Shorts:**

1. According to Marketwatch, the Short interest of float is 11.68%
2. According to Fintel, the Short interest of float is 65%.
3. Go figure.
4. Regardless what people think, Cathie Wood is a great investor. She has been betting on NNDM for a while and praising their vision in the media. [https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-nndm](https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-nndm)

&#x200B;

**Final Words**I have tried to present to you the information that has driven my approach to NNDM and their potential without presenting too many biased thoughts.

My **biased** thought are, this is the fucking future, this company is going to take our technological advancement to the next level, towards scifi shit. In short, I love what they want to do, it will be a progress but I would love to fund their efforts, although I am an Europoor.

Since you want to know my positions anyway:

While they have no disclosed how much they bought Deep Cube and the other company for, they are still in the process of trying to acquire more desirable companies inline with their goal. Additionally, the CEO has started allocating more money for marketing purposes, which to me seems to show conviction in his actions."

2021-06-04 21:03:28,wallstreetbets,"WKHS will be next. Workhorse currently has a 42% short float which could cause a short squeeze. The support is around $13.00 with bulls still in control of the chart. This is similar to AMC because the higher the short interest the higher the squeeze will go. For example, shorts borrow shares from a broker for a fee. This is possible because people buy shares and don’t set limit orders. This is why it is important to set limit orders high so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. The shorts then sell your shares that they just borrowed for a fee to then sell on the open market driving the price down. Shorts make money by selling the shares back to the broker at a lower price as well as making money through buying put options. A short squeeze happens when shorts have to buy back their shares that they borrowed from a broker at a higher price. We can accelerate a short squeeze through buying the shares and setting a limit order high above the ask so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. This will cause the stock price to go up which will cause shorts to buy back the shares that they borrowed causing a “short squeeze”. For example, if we buy WKHS at “market price”, such as $13.00, it will cause the stock price to go up at which point shorts will need to cover their positions or risk being margin called which means that the broker can automatically close out the short’s position which will cause them to buy back those shares at “market price” which is often much higher then when they borrowed them which causes the shorts to lose their money by handing it over us as we sell our shares when the price is above $100/share."

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"[] Biomethane / Renewable Natural Gas: why it deserves as much attention as HYDROGEN & BATTERIES....and Wall-Street brokers and Investments Banks are not paying enough attention (yet) Hello everyone,

Here a top-down policy and regulatory analysis on the reasons why Renewable Natural Gas (in Europe we call it biomethane) makes sense for the transport sector. Still, the sector has not yet received the attention it deserves from major Investment Banks and Wall-Streets brokers (while hydrogen companies and batteries are covered by everyone).

$CLNE is covered only by Credit Suisse but further brokers may come in the next months.

these are the bullet points to take into consideration for Natural Gas Vehicles trends:

* **GHG BALANCE**: In order to get it you need to collect methane that would have alternatively leaked into the atmosphere, thus you immensely decrease the GHG emission balance of your activity as methane has a 30x worse effect than CO2). This is why according to the Low Carbon fuel standard system RNG has a negative carbon intensity. if you burn what you collected you will always have a minor impact on the environment in terms of GHG emissions. This is also why in some organizations and states natural gas vehicles fueled with RNG will be considered like ZERO EMISSION Vehicles despite the tailpipe emission of their combustion engines (as a reminder a natural gas combustion engine, compared to a diesel one, emits; 99% less **SOx** , 80% less **NOx,** 95% less **PM2.5 (Particulate)**, 20% less **CO2 (with a negative balance if Renewable Natural gas is used, see links below):**

* **Farmer policy**: More importantly, collecting and selling it creates a stream of revenues for farmers who are the most important electoral class. Democrats and republicans both need farmer votes to win at state and federal level, and very often measures to help and support farmers are bipartisan in the House (trump trade war tariffs being an exception). Meat production is an energy intensive operations and farmers risk to be hit by heavy CO2 or GHG emissions taxes, thus RNG solve this issue for them:

* **Fuel Price**: what made CLNE  succeed in their early golden age was nothing related to the environment. Nobody cared about it in 2010-2015. Natural gas price was favorable if compared with diesel and the companies were able to raise capital substantially. What went wrong? the spread differential became not favorable and the companies entered in a spiral of negative events (and mismanagement). Today natural gas is still cheaper and thanks to incentives RNG can be blended with fossil one. Thus, if you buy a natural gas truck you enjoy a lower fuel price.

1. [""Fuel costs savings with natural gas""](https://www.fortisbc.com/est/mining-trucks/fuel-cost-savings-with-natural-gas)

* **Fleet operators business model**: truck drivers margins are attacked from any side. Increasing labor costs, expensive diesel price, increasing environmental regulatory burden all make the business harder. and what some green extremists wants? they want truck drivers to buy expensive, not yet market ready, battery electric trucks, whose charging time and range capabilities are still suboptimal. Not mentioning what can happen to , let's say, the LA harbor, if all the 16000 trucks switch to electric versions. How can you find the grid to power them in that single place, and more specifically, in California?

* **Supply:** eventually RNG can satisfy from 10 to 20% of overall natural gas demand. With a preferential flow into the transport sector it can be able to satisfy more than 40% of natural gas transport demand. In California in 2020 it satisfied 90% of NG trucks demand; in Germany 50% of the gas used in transport is renewable (Europe as a whole is 20%)

2. [""biomethane potential accross the world""](https://energypost.eu/biogas-and-biomethanes-untapped-potential-across-the-world/)

But how many natural gas vehicles there can be on the road? For this it is a good idea to look at China, which has a tremendous problem with urban emissions. IN 2015 Government there decided that LNG trucks had to gain market share in order to improve air quality. In 2020, LNG trucks were responsible for 10% of all Heavy Duty Trucks sales in the country (source: [http://www.chinatrucks.com/statistics/2020/1229/article\_9522.html](http://www.chinatrucks.com/statistics/2020/1229/article_9522.html)). In Europe the same measure is equal to 4% of all sales, while in the US it should be like 2%.

Therefore, if natural gas trucks are going to rise in sales in the US too (see Cummins last cc for this info) it is natural to understand why the potential of CLNE is so high. Then it is obvious the reason of the investment of Amazon in the company. Please note that Amazon will invest in 5 tranches spread in a time span of 10 years, with a strike price of $13.49.

There's a lot of new traders involved in this stock, and they have been taking shit like ""GME/AMC/PLTR/BB will moon next Friday!

This is not the revolution of retail traders we keep thinking it is. Maybe 4 million people on this sub are better off and are actually learning how to work their own money, but the rest of this subreddit and many people watching everything on the news have only had the idea of ""people can just tell me which stocks are about to moon and I'll invest"" cemented in their mind.

Lets Send it to the MOON With all the hype this week doubt this gets read but wanted to post my first DD and hopefully share the love with my fellow smooth brain friends. This will probably be way too long for many, but hoping some will read it... 

I love Energy Transfer ($ET) and think you could make at least *30%* this year... not to mention the options with extraordinarily low IV. I picked up 75 LEAPS a few months back and they have made a killing.

&#x200B;

[ET Proof of GAINZ](https://preview.redd.it/uzgxq44w9a371.png?width=454&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ff495e0b14effadfcbaf7bc395950918262485)

You've probably never heard of it but ET is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in the U.S., consisting of 90,000 miles of pipelines, large amounts of storage capacity, 62 natural gas processing and treating facilities, 35 active refined products marketing terminals, and immense exporting capabilities. Its a MASSIVE company that has $40 Billion in revenue and a market cap of 27.4B... yes, you read that correctly.

Plus as a a partnership they give a ***7% distribution*** per year. They will pay you to hold the stock while it prints money and adds value (I have shares too). And you're not too late! The stock jumped from $10.15 last week to $10.75 today and the options prices have barely budged... just picked up 150 call contracts in anticipation of earnings on June 17th. You can literally still pick up an $11 Call for 6/25 for $0.23 and if you're like me trading GME, BB, and even NOK that is mind blowing.  

***Financial Metrics:***

Current Price: $10.76; Pre-Pandemic: $13.55 ; Average Price Target: $13.35

Revenue: $40 Billion ; Market Cap: $28 Billion

P/E: 8 ; Yield *7.2%*

***Key Activities Past Year:***

\- Booked an unexpected 5 billion in revenue related to the Texas winter storm and aggressively paid down debt

\- Acquired Enable Midstream for $7 Billion in all equity transaction which improved their debt metrics and expanded the portfolio ([https://ir.energytransfer.com/news-releases/news-release-details/energy-transfer-acquire-enable-midstream-7-billion-all-equity](https://ir.energytransfer.com/news-releases/news-release-details/energy-transfer-acquire-enable-midstream-7-billion-all-equity))

It’s still not impossible either, rules can change and restructuring can happen. 

I do about 20 hours of research on the stock a week. I went straight to the filings and found the following information that makes RKT insanely Bullish play and investors wet dream. Not financial advice. 

The best part about this DD is that the news wasn’t shared to retail and kept quiet so you know it’s legitimate stuff. 

One of the requirements of being inducted into the SP 500 is having 10% of the company shares available to the free float. Right now it’s 7% and just recently grew at the end of May. Which I just found out.

https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/sp-500-brochure.pdf


Here is the filing.. just happened. 

https://doc.morningstar.com/Document/045ec7d96db807790e6ffacc2db8cf35.msdoc/original?clientid=globaldocuments&amp;key=52dbc583e1012395

RKT was also just ranked 194 in the fortune 500 recently, and also ranked 5th in the best places to work by the Fortune 500. The company also makes billions of dollars a quarter and netted $2 billion in q1. 

One of the reasons why RKT is trading at its current price is because the float availability is so small. There is no other reason than that because you can’t be ranked the 194th richest company in America and have a market cap of less than $40 billion when the average company on the SP 500 is trading at an average PE ratio of 30 to 40. ARKT is sitting at four. Obviously it can be undervalued but it doesn’t make sense to anybody unless you read this post or do any research whatsoever. Not only that but they are continuing to grow and aggressively successful in doing so. 

Here’s the funny part and makes a ton of sense. If you look at the filing, Dan Gilbert sold his shares at $16.83 a share. Wonder why he would do that? Well if you read the filing you’ll see that he is transferring his shares to class D shares which is used for employees and typically employees get a discount on a stock plan. Being that it’s one of the best places to work according to fortune 500 it’s reasonable to assume that they have a great benefits plan. Now the shares are sitting as class D shares waiting to be distributed either as gifts, awards, or acquired by employees through their stock purchase plan on a discount of current market price. He literally sold shares way below valuation to provide employees with amazing benefits. 

Funny part is now the stock is sitting around $20 a share. If the employee gets...I don’t know, a dollar discount. They now get it at 19. Selling at 16.83 gives Gilbert wiggle room when his employees purchase shares. This means it’s very unlikely the stock will ever fall below $18 again due to the fact that Gilbert will now possibly be taking a loss on the shares that he sold. He won’t have any shares below 16.83 available in his class D. So if an employee wants to purchase the stock at a discount and the stock sitting sitting at $17 there are no shares available to buy at 16… Get my drift.?  Maybe this is another reason why he sold shares at 25 because he knew he needed to transfer shares lower and wanted his employees to accumulate at a very awesome price because the man is selfless.

Now... as far as the market goes investors know exactly that this is happening, trust me they have been around the block. They also now see how much a philanthropist the owner actually is and that they actually achieve the results that they speak of. You’re not one of the richest people in the world and don’t know how to work the market especially when you own a multi billion dollar mortgage company which frequently involved the market. 

This is amazing in so many ways because investors are not going to let retail buy below 18 for a very long time or ever and if they do you better load the F up. Once he transfers  remaining 3% needed to be in the S&amp;P 500 the stock will soar even higher, but I think there’s going to be investors pushing up the price at a premium prior to this happening. I don’t think it’ll take any longer. I’m hoping that some stupid hedge fund associate read this post and tells his boss to gig is up so that it just happens already but maybe that’s wishful thinking.

Honestly if it gets inducted into the S&amp;P 500 and they actually achieve the results they want to achieve as they verbally stated in multiple earnings calls, 1k-2k a share is actually possible for a company ATH.
They have shown that they continue to grow and innovate at any cost.

My PT is $80 by November 2021. Pos 15k in  January 2023 calls. Looking to retire on this one. If you want something shorter there is a cup and handle for me on the daily chart with the gap to fill about 15% up from here. 

TLDR: RKT will eventually be inducted into spy as the owner continues to transfer class a shares to class D shares for employee plans. They were sold at 16.83 and I am assuming the reason is because the employees get the stock at a discounted price. This is just a theory but holy shit it makes a ton of fucking sense and I cannot wait to be a millionaire.

Edit: Also , I believe the buyback will only be initiated if it goes below 17 again. Then he probably will transfer shares at a higher price in which his employees will have no problem obtaining again at a discount.

Edit 2: please don’t talk about UWMC, you’re literally here because RKT put you on the board. Seriously, I don’t care how much Adderall I take I won’t waste anymore brain power on researching that stock. I know you’re going to anyway because I can’t get away from you cockroaches, but try not to if you can. Comparing the two is actually disrespectful. Come back to this post once they make it to the Fortune 500.

Edit 3: I was just informed on dual class structure which doesn’t allow for RKT into SPY. Unless there is a way around it. Companies like Google were grandfathered in. Fuck me eh. Regardless, a larger float and a the reason for the transfer of shares is still bullish. I would change the title if I could. Still useful info and also unlikely to see it below 17 for an extended period of time due to the fact the Dan sold shares at a 15% discount"

2021-06-04 21:25:59,wallstreetbets,"As we’ve been seeing, RKT is making money hand over fists. Its expected to slow down with the potential for a rate rise and a housing correction, sure. But they are expanding in auto loans (and im sure more ancillary lines later). 
With a p/e this low, the main problem here is the small float. Its hardly a private company and any time the stock starts running, Dan can just dump shares.

To combat this we saw them issue a fat special dividend to reward holders. They could continue doing dividends when flush with cash or continue to get even more aggressive and expand into other operations with said cash. Either way, the more Dan sells, the better it’ll be for the stock long-term, especially once in the s&p.

Hell, once in the s&p, Dan just basically sell his shares to the funds that scoop up RKT when rebalancing"

It still explains why the owner would sell shares so low and also informs investors that the float has increased as many did not know. It also gives an idea of why the stock might up this week. It also gives investors confidence to invest because he wouldn’t have sold at a 15% discount if it wasn’t a discount. Hence why I haven’t taken it down. Plus Im really happy you’re so mad"

2021-06-04 20:17:51,wallstreetbets,This is just wrong. There are many types of investing with many different objectives. The only reason to specifically want a larger % of shares outstanding is to engage in shareholder activism. Standard and Poor's has rules about the size of the float to ensure sufficient liquidity. When a name is added to a major index it has to get bought up by a lot of index funds which requires liquidity. On top of that changes to the SP500 and their other indices are decided by a committee. It's not a formula.
2021-06-05 07:50:32,wallstreetbets,No I’m not mad. You’re just an idiot. You write a DD mainly based on inclusion to S&P that can never happen. You claim that you do all this research but you miss a crucial element. It’s good that you leave the edit there so people know how shitty your DD is.

Also, the life of a vehicle can position drivers as buyers years down the road...imo most new buyers will either be loyal or chase profits. Neither outcome is better than the other inherently on its own, but long term I see more of an upside.

I wouldn’t necessarily bet against Ford but I wouldn’t bet against a smaller company that only needs to provide to their clientele and is otherwise focused on a more narrow branch of the transportation industry.

Good point on Ford though, if both are relatively breaking into the market at the same time; the two will certainly be competing for contracts and fleet bids. There is also lots of new growth to increase profits with AI and logistics...all depends on the company’s decisions as a whole."

With the current hype, we could likely see >10% days. Once it hits $13, it's open flight to the moon.

As you can see, this is NOT a stretch play, this is a very reasonable, achievable, but absolute home run play, especially with the fundamentals that other DDs have previously illustrated.

Note: the above is not financial advice and only an expression of my personal opinion.

1,200 shares at $9.34

15 x $15c 6/18

**EDIT (as of 4:35pm ET on 6/4/21):** We did it all, at a current afterhours price of $9.57, we hit the 5% daily gain for the day. Not too bad was it?

&#x200B;

 

**EDIT (as of close on 6/7/21):** We did well on Friday (5% up) and had another excellent day today (\~10% up). As a result, the daily % gain required to hit $13 by 6/14 has **decreased by 40 basis pts from 5% on Friday to 4.6% as of close today.**

Also, shits and giggles, I an additional scenario assuming we replicate another 10% day tomorrow. This implies **we'd only need a \~3% avg. daily gain after that to hit $13 by 6/14.**

2021-06-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Burn Baby Burn! Why $PYR is gonna light up the afterburners 🚀 Hello! Tried to post this a month ago but it was juuuuust below 1bn cap. But after yesterday’s push, PYR is now poised to start its climb.

What is PYR (Pyrogenesis)?

PYR is a Montreal based company that specializes in large plasma torches. The unique thing about these torches and the tech behind them is the multiple applications they can be used for.

The Bull Case

PYR has multiple revenue streams. This includes 3D printing powders (this is why PYR is a part of ARK Prnt ETF),
Waste incineration (the US navy uses Pyro on its ships for waste disposal), and a variety of uses in recycling metals (iron ore pelletization and dross recovery).

Additionally, pyros tech uses sustainable biotech to fuel itself. All together, PYR has created a very green product that can be very attractive to companies looking to be compliant with new legislation.

They carry no debt, have had nice increases on revenue on each earning report and have just recently submitted a very large (for them) bid for 36 new plasma torches (about 3m per torch). They’re also carrying a lot of cash on hand. Check out the balance sheet, their financials look great for a company looking to expand.

Additionally the float is 85m shares and this thing has been shorted to oblivion but is just now starting to show it’s worth.

The bear case

PYR has a small customer base at the moment, and one of its largest contracts is with the US Navy. Being overly dependent on government contracts can shake investor confidence if more clients can’t be added quickly enough. Looking at you PLTR.

The tech is expensive. Companies may be able to find a cheaper option to be green compliant, the cost of switching to a PYR based system is significant.

All in all, I’m bullish on PYR. It’s a stick that has been rumbling around on the message boards but now looks primed for takeoff."

I've been following this stock since IPO with great interest. Searching for the right options play. Looked at $30 8/20 calls but not sold yet at current price and overall lack of interest. Does it worry you that there is so little volume on the options?

there is an interesting opportunity of investing in Norwegian Air company. $NWARF

As you may know, they recently got out of bankruptcy after gathering around 700 million dollars.
The price per share is 1.34$, right before the crisis the price was roughly 200$ per share.
We can see that it was stable through 2019 year.
I don't know much, and I don't know what Will be the future of the company. Honestly, I don't believe they'll hit the 200$ mark again. But that the beauty, we only need for them to hit the 20$ mark, a 10% of theirs previous 
value, to become rich.

Also, what is the risk?
Let's say it won't reach the moon, but can it go any lower?
After covid, bankruptcy and splitting the shares it really feels like rock bottom for this stick.

2021-06-04 20:01:52,wallstreetbets,"What is the Pattern Day Trade Rule?  
Pattern Day Trade rule also known as PDT is in place to protect the beginner traders. It is important to know this rule if you have less than $25,000 in your bank account or trading account and you are an active trader.  
The rule states if you are an active trader, meaning if you make 4 or more trades in a 5 day period, then you will be stuck in your fourth trade place. Therefore you won’t be able to make any more trades until your early trades are cleared.  For example, if you made two trades on Monday, one on Tuesday, and one on Wednesday, you won’t be able to make a trade on Thursday; therefore, if the market is crashing, you will be stuck in that place.  
It is the law; you can call your broker, but they won’t be able to do anything for you as they are bound by these regulations by the SEC.  
When can PDT be a problem?  
Let’s say you are entering a position with a hundred chairs, and then you are selling on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. You won’t be able to trade if you spot something better because you stocked up your four positions already. That’s the one main problem with Pattern Day Trade, you have to be aware of it, if you have less than $25,000 in your account and you are an active trader.  
How to avoid PDT  
One way to avoid the Pattern Day Trade rule is to set up two or more brokerage accounts. Let’s say you have $20,000 in your account, and have one account at Scottrade, Option House, and have a third account at Trade King. This will allow you to have four trades on each of those brokerage accounts, which will give you about 12 trades total.  
Again, you will have to be cautious when trading, but then you will also have to worry about managing all logins, trades, and making sure your amount does not reach $25,000. However, this way is great because it will allow you to trade more actively. As many people use this way to avoid the Pattern Day Trade rule.  
What happens if you have more than $25,000?  
Now if you have more than $25,000 in your account you will get flagged as a Pattern Day Trade. Your margin requirements will be slightly higher because they think you are a bit more risky, but don’t worry there is nothing to worry about.  
If your account drops below $25,000, you will again be bounded by the PDT rule. Just be aware of the pattern day trader rule because it is in place to protect beginner traders."

2021-06-04 21:01:26,wallstreetbets,"Workhorse currently has a 42% short float which could cause a short squeeze. The support is around $13.00 with bulls still in control of the chart. This is similar to AMC because the higher the short interest the higher the squeeze will go. For example, shorts borrow shares from a broker for a fee. This is possible because people buy shares and don’t set limit orders. This is why it is important to set limit orders high so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. The shorts then sell your shares that they just borrowed for a fee to then sell on the open market driving the price down. Shorts make money by selling the shares back to the broker at a lower price as well as making money through buying put options. A short squeeze happens when shorts have to buy back their shares that they borrowed from a broker at a higher price. We can accelerate a short squeeze through buying the shares and setting a limit order high above the ask so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. This will cause the stock price to go up which will cause shorts to buy back the shares that they borrowed causing a “short squeeze”. For example, if we buy WKHS at “market price”, such as $13.00, it will cause the stock price to go up at which point shorts will need to cover their positions or risk being margin called which means that the broker can automatically close out the short’s position which will cause them to buy back those shares at “market price” which is often much higher then when they borrowed them which causes the shorts to lose their money by handing it over us as we sell our shares when the price is above $100/share. 🐴👍"

2021-06-05 01:05:51,wallstreetbets,Pattern Day Trading. If you own $1000 of Tesla. And sell. Technically you have to wait 3 days for the sale to complete and the funds to appear in your account before you can buy again. Read up on T+2. If you sell 1000 Tesla then immediately buy VAL the new meme stock. You broke the rules. You didnt wait 3 days. And if you are like yeah but VAL is running and I don’t want to miss the moon. Some brokers will give you a one time pass. But if yoi break PDT 3 times in a 365 period you get banned from trading unless you get approved as a PDT which must retail investors don’t want to deal with. I’m a lawyer. This is not legal advice. Most of you eat crayons. You wouldn’t know legal advice if it fucked your wife after her boyfriend was tired.
2021-06-04 21:57:49,wallstreetbets,Sounds good thanks . I will make my 4th day trade monday
2021-06-04 21:59:04,wallstreetbets,Same here the big Orange warning is so scary
2021-06-04 20:38:09,wallstreetbets,Except that doesn't actually make sense. It's a 25k limit for everyone. A person could hypothetically lose millions on margin and 25k won't do a damn thing. It only prevents poor people from day trading.
2021-06-04 22:30:50,wallstreetbets,"What? That makes 0 sense considering you can trade on margin, short stock, and enter complex spreads with only 2k."
2021-06-05 02:55:08,wallstreetbets,"I know and hang my head in shameful agreement!

I’m starting to realize my Ron popeil “set it and forget it” approach does not work well with these meme stocks.  Fortunately, I only have gme, amc, and express making me lose my hair (others, like GOEV and several cannabis stocks only give me gray hairs!!!)

Amc and express I’m fine on—-bought for cheap; gme is what started my meme stock run but I bought in at a high price and now have no choice but to just sit and wait for it to go up before I sell even one share.  And yes, I am holding out for big money on those (idk about those claims of 100k or 1M, but at least $5k so I can buy a nice toupee!!

I can’t bring myself to sell Amc now that I missed that crest, so I’ll wait to see what happens next week—-hopefully it goes back up past $60 and I’ll sell and just rebuy when it goes down again (did that a few times with gme).

To think that prior to covid—-I wasn’t worrying about these things!"

2021-06-04 21:18:03,wallstreetbets,Brokerages don't talk to each other or even themselves. I opened a second Robinhood account specifically to skirt this restriction
2021-06-04 22:02:38,wallstreetbets,Why would the government do something like that to (P)rofitable (D)ay (T)raders.  I must be missing something.
2021-06-05 00:15:10,wallstreetbets,Is it only applicable to margin accounts?
2021-06-05 10:29:29,wallstreetbets,"Correct.  If you have an account value of $25k, TDA is 100% fine with you doing as many DT's as you'd like.  I specifically asked that question."
2021-06-04 20:43:02,wallstreetbets,">I have no idea why anyone uses RH or any of these other discount broker apps when all the retail brokers went to $0 commission.

Because all of the money in my actively managed account is play money and I trade exclusively for entertainment, and the interface for RH is still miles better than any of the super serious trading apps. And even for more serious traders who don't see trading as basically a casino you play on your sofa when you're bored, most of the features and benefits of ""real"" trading apps are negligible. And for ""real"" day traders, the advantages offered by ""real"" trading platforms are kind of a wash compared to just tossing your money into a trash can, setting it on fire, and toasting your nuts over the fire."
2021-06-04 22:30:41,wallstreetbets,You must be new to gambling.
2021-06-04 22:36:34,wallstreetbets,You can trade on margin... But your buying power is limited. It's completely designed from stopping people who have no idea what they're doing building up 100k worth of trades on buying power and not being able to afford it. I don't like the rule but it makes sense from an institutional standpoint. It's also not hard to gather 25k in an account if you've been trading for 1-2 years and start out with just a few thousand and slowly add to it. If you have 1k to your name and try to blow up a margin account it's much harder than if they let you trade on buying power until each trade clears.
2021-06-05 03:05:41,wallstreetbets,"what happens when my ""investments"" expire 🤡"
2021-06-05 00:07:01,wallstreetbets,"Hrmm, okay. I know in my experience back testing it's easier to make all the right trades because you have as long as you want to figure things out. The candles aren't forming before your very eyes in those moments. The disadvantage of course is that you don't get the information presented to you from watching the candles actually form up.

My best guess then is that it is your nerves when things are live. Time pressure isn't likely the result since you're doing it live when paper trading, but at no actual risk. 

The other thing that took me a while to really figure out is that all stocks truly do trade differently, so when you paper trade a stock and do really well, you may just be taking that strategy to another security that it just doesn't work as well on.

To give an example, I seem to have developed a decent ""spidey sense"" when reading MVIS (sorry long guys / bag holders) that is then buffed by a set of two indicators that yield tons of successful trades on MVIS. If I take that same exact approach to another stock, I may get stopped out all day.

Gotta remember too that the market itself can really drive things also. Let's say you're only going long on your setups. If you're paper trading on a day where the stock runs 14-20%, well you probably had a fuck ton more setups present themselves to you, and those setups in general probably had a higher probability of trading your direction. If you're live trading a stock that's going to grow 3% in a day, you're not likely to see the same results even if you're applying a winning strategy to the same security.

This is really the best info I can dig out of my skull for you. To provide an honest and clear disclosure, I'm really not that great and am a little under a year into the game entirely. It's really only been the last month or so that I've started to see a success rate that I'm very happy with, and It's not lost on me that it may not last.

Hopefully some real day trader chad pro can see this and give better info. Even if not, I hope what little I have to offer does help you."
2021-06-04 23:13:14,wallstreetbets,"I was up 2.5k on calls and couldn’t close my position due to PDT

Still was able to make a thousand but shit

I guess since I didn’t have $25k in my account already I didn’t deserve the $2.5k"
2021-06-05 00:02:46,wallstreetbets,Ha yeah well Robinhood...Wendies... who can tell the difference?
2021-06-05 02:37:16,wallstreetbets,Lmao 😂
2021-06-04 21:25:18,wallstreetbets,"Yes.  But it also applies if you fall below the 25k again.  You can have a bad day and the inability to abort on a trade forces you to invest differently.  It sucks when you’re watching a knife and you can’t abort.  

Working at that margin also sets you up for more emotional trades trying not to fall below margin, taking riskier and poorer trades.

Make sure you start with 36k.  It will save you money, but don’t go straight to that, because you’ll lose half almost immediately."
2021-06-04 21:11:29,wallstreetbets,"No, and that’s not day trading"
2021-06-04 22:21:47,wallstreetbets,Sorry to hear that. Do you have the loss porn?
2021-06-04 21:33:22,wallstreetbets,You speak for us commoners.
2021-06-04 20:10:15,wallstreetbets,"If you read the terms and conditions, they probably reserve the right to automatically switch you to a margin account if it's required to make your trades. 

I'm pretty sure people had issues with that on Robinhood with the whole GME thing back in January. They weren't letting people buy GME on margin and a lot of people who thought they had cash accounts realized they had been switched to margin based on their trading history, ie- sold shares of something and immediately bought shares of something else before the end of the settlement period."
2021-06-05 06:42:56,wallstreetbets,"??? And how exactly would I blow up my $1000 account by making 10 day trades that are $5 each? They already limit your buying power if you day trade close to what is in your account so your argument makes no sense.

Can inexperienced day traders lose money faster? Yes. Have I lost money or missed out on obvious opportunities because I have 0 day trades left? Yes.

You can also buy 25k in 0 DTE options and blow up your account in 1 hour from 25k to $0 with a brand new account and 0 experience with options or the stock market. Tell me, where is the rule to protect against that? These rules are not in place to protect you.

Additionally, this rule does not track across different brokers. I could make 15 different accounts, each with a different broker, and DT 45 times a week. Why incentivize that?"
2021-06-05 04:58:22,wallstreetbets,Thank you I really appreciate the words of wisdom. It’s definitely time getting to me since I wana get rich fast but have these options eating my stash

2021-06-04 22:25:06,wallstreetbets,"That's a different rule violation. That is a GFV. Using any unsettled funds to purchase then resell a security before the funds settle. General settling date after the sale of a security is trade day + 2 business days. 

You can get around it if you really need to make a move by wiring the amount of the security cost to your account."
2021-06-05 07:09:29,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're attempting to say here, but are you not referring to Good Faith Violations? Which apply for if you use the funds from a sale to pay for it's own unsettled-purchase? Aka, if you have enough *settled* cash then buying and selling the same day is fine?

Or are you referring to something else here? It's early for me."

You can do more in edge than the website, more in the website than mobile, and the mobile app frequently misses features/guards that are implemented in the site or edge application.

2021-06-04 23:22:18,wallstreetbets,That was brutal
2021-06-04 20:24:18,wallstreetbets,We need cash for blow and cheap Friday option contracts.
2021-06-04 23:14:23,wallstreetbets,Thats unrealistic. Lets say monday 24 and friday 86

2021-06-04 23:27:06,wallstreetbets,How does it work?
2021-06-05 00:27:53,wallstreetbets,Lol what squeeze??
2021-06-04 21:30:01,wallstreetbets,"I'm not one of the ""DIAMOND HAND APES TO THE MOON!"" crowd, but just remember that all the investing articles said not to buy GME at $60 and AMC at $12."
2021-06-05 00:07:42,wallstreetbets,Monday premarket may be an indicator..
2021-06-05 00:05:55,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain your take on this? I’m curious to in what way, since hedge funds also trade both ways..."
2021-06-05 10:58:21,wallstreetbets,Bb is a distraction from AMC
2021-06-05 16:22:32,wallstreetbets,"Just keep buying more, your price will keep getting lower and then if it jumps even a little you’ll be set"
2021-06-05 02:20:31,wallstreetbets,There i fixed it
2021-06-05 02:45:31,wallstreetbets,I upvoted you because 69

2021-06-04 20:58:37,wallstreetbets,Threes not enough but five should do it.
2021-06-04 20:15:28,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Just take enough to feed yourself. You don't need pants.
2021-06-04 21:42:00,wallstreetbets,Why take gains when you can hold for really big gains? This is not the way
2021-06-04 22:47:02,wallstreetbets,"Thank god someone finally said it. I tell people I was all in for 200 bucks back in January. I dropped my one share of gme when it was at 400. Bought into AMC for 29 shares. Cashed part of that for 700 leaving me with 10 shares. Sure I got scared but at the same time it doesnt have to be all or nothing. I will slowly purchase more shares of AMC and BB until I gain enough to shift my money. We are not all in the position to lose money. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)

Edit: this is not financial advice. I am not smart or old to the game. Very new and very excited but happy with my small gain."
2021-06-05 01:10:43,wallstreetbets,"In blackjack or craps, the comparatively attractive house odds don’t matter if behaviorally you play till you’re out of money anyway.

Perhaps a good lesson for stock trading too."

2021-06-04 20:32:59,wallstreetbets,Let’s gooo! I actually bought 170 more shares haha
2021-06-05 10:29:12,wallstreetbets,69 Nice.
2021-06-04 20:28:07,wallstreetbets,"He said ""Hold"" <------"
2021-06-05 08:51:15,wallstreetbets,Valid argument. Sorry for my miscalculation
2021-06-04 21:19:28,wallstreetbets,"Hope so, cause I'm short like 2 grand from my bills this month. Oh well, guess i'll just die"
2021-06-05 00:26:30,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-06-04 20:03:22,wallstreetbets,"> I just believe this is big institutions scaring retail investors so they can load up before it takes off

So the big institutions can load up? What are they doing to scare retail, and why does that warrant you posting the same comment 16 times?"
2021-06-04 21:31:11,wallstreetbets,"Just hang on to it. Panic selling immediately after a dip isn't usually the best plan, and BB cycles enough that it's a pretty sure bet you'll see it above $20 sometime in the next few weeks to months"
2021-06-04 21:35:51,wallstreetbets,10$?
2021-06-05 05:48:00,wallstreetbets,Why 14-15?
2021-06-04 21:53:20,wallstreetbets,I’m in the 10 shares club too. Waiting to graduate the AMC squeeze to buy more BB
2021-06-04 20:37:52,wallstreetbets,"The Wyckoff Method: just look it up, I’m not spamming. I just believe in this company."
2021-06-04 22:05:54,wallstreetbets,"definitely 10 on monday, I think AMC isn’t going down much so hopefully i’m not betting against AMC. still confident though already up 50%"
2021-06-05 10:18:53,wallstreetbets,"Because trying to time the bottom is a recipe for disaster. Similar to trying to gamble on weekly far OTM calls on meme stocks. Will they surge at some point? Probably, will it be this week? Who the fuck knows. 

I do actually believe in the long term value of BB way more than I believe the long term value of some meme stocks like AMC. So I’m ok holding onto it (especially with house money) with an average buy in in the low to mid teens."
2021-06-04 23:24:43,wallstreetbets,"You're doing a pretty bad job at defending yourself. You're not making any sense. I'm no mod, but I don't know how you can say posting the same thing 16 times is not spamming."
2021-06-04 23:09:49,wallstreetbets,I think 10 Monday is an awful call dude. I did some for 6/25 and some for 7/09. Don't underestimate the volume
2021-06-04 21:56:32,wallstreetbets,Color and number of the 🐐 Jordan bless
2021-06-05 01:11:35,wallstreetbets,Good luck
2021-06-04 23:13:59,wallstreetbets,"volume doesn’t mean alot when the stock is overvalued, I learned that from 🆘 actually look into the stock, Gamestop = gaming industry. AMC = Cinema industry.  Blackberry has no value. When squeezes happen with stocks you have to recognize which ones are sus. 
I understand there’s a lot of new members in this sub reddit but seriously do research I hate to see y’all lose money"
2021-06-04 20:08:11,wallstreetbets,Gotta hold BB and TSLA for 10 years for massive gains. Just hope we're still alive to buy that lambo
2021-06-04 23:37:21,wallstreetbets,Guess we'll see

2021-06-05 00:12:18,wallstreetbets,This might be a great way to make 1k this week
2021-06-05 03:40:43,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 1 month

2021-06-05 10:57:02,wallstreetbets,What is a lambo ? At what point would you sell the BB?
2021-06-05 11:08:23,wallstreetbets,I folded and sold my AMC in April when it hit 15 smh. Won’t be making that same mistake twice

2021-06-05 00:28:34,wallstreetbets,"Legitimately what everyone said in February. “Experts” said to expect it to approach $1 when it was hovering around $5. And now it’s been fluctuating close to around 10x that YTD low

Experts can have all the financial knowledge and experience in the world, but at the end of the day they hardly can predict anything more than we can."

2021-06-05 13:44:49,wallstreetbets,Why stop there. Imagine if it were to get to 1 billion a share.

Electric is viable for consumers but not long haul due to the charging times - you're not going to be able to truck cross-country on a schedule waiting a few hours to recharge. This is why Amazon signed a deal with CLNE.

The infrastructure for hydrogen is years away and the tech isn't there yet. In the meantime the only option is CNG."

BB can get to the 55.00 to 73.00 in the next 3/4 weeks let’s blow this out of the water this week and continue the trend to the moon over the next three weeks..  it’s going to take some time so keep on BUYING and HOLD!!

2021-06-05 07:31:45,wallstreetbets,That’s the way.
2021-06-05 00:13:10,wallstreetbets,"I'm also new and retarded, but let me try. Basically, it says you'll only buy a stock for X price or lower. 


I used this the other day to buy AMC. I saw it rising and falling between $40-45, so I set a limit order to buy at $42. This meant the order wouldn't be executed until the price dipped to $42 or below. Once the price hit that target, the order went through, and I owned some AMC. Later in the day I set a sell limit order for $65, so when the stock hit that price, the shares sold.


[Here's an explanation of a limit order from Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp#:\~:text=A%20limit%20order%20is%20the,price%20of%20%2414.50%20or%20lower.&text=Limit%20orders%20can%20also%20be%20left%20open%20with%20an%20expiration%20date).

I've been paper trading on tradingview.com to practice since all of this is new to me. Lots of Youtube too. Overall, retarded, mostly look at colors on graphs."

2021-06-05 14:38:46,wallstreetbets,"13 is what, 40% more expensive? Are you saying that in 10 years, it won't matter if you have 10,000 stocks, or 14,000? If that's the case, then that means your investment will be worth chump change or nothing in 10 years. 

Otherwise, if you're attempting to imply that it'll be worth alot, then yeah, it truly fucking matters if you buy at 9 or 13."

Bottom line, potential gamma squeeze if it closes above $13 on 6/18, but a solid company that is a steal at this price regardless (in my opinion; not a financial advisor)."
2021-06-05 01:02:22,wallstreetbets,Bruh.  Just the response I was looking for.    I’m in pretty big at 14.40.   Want to wait and read up before I throw more into this.   The covered call premiums lured me into this.   Shit was so fuckin juicy.   Poor bastards who bought those calls 🤷‍♂️

2021-06-05 14:45:27,wallstreetbets,Rich is subjective. And 20% of what... It is relative to your investment. 20% of 10$ is not much. 20% of 100k is a nice return.

2021-06-05 01:41:03,wallstreetbets,"I wonder how many % of this sub actually made money in GME/AMC and how many are just bagholders.  


I could have made a 300% profit on GME but since I held, I don't care about profits anymore."
2021-06-05 02:22:03,wallstreetbets,Maybe in 2025 lol
2021-06-05 02:59:42,wallstreetbets,We’ll be there shortly

2021-06-05 05:09:34,wallstreetbets,How can u guys be buying BB when AMc is way much better than that.
2021-06-05 05:26:36,wallstreetbets,"I was not a fan of BB but after looking it over again, reading the DD. 
I bought in last week. Shares & to help the trip to the moon, I sold ITM cash secured puts & used the premium to buy calls. If the puts I sold get exercised, good, I’ll sell them some more & buy more calls.

C-ya on the moon fellow apes"
2021-06-05 05:52:05,wallstreetbets,They’re not coming to get you bro. If BB spikes like AMC did it will be down to the institutions. Your friends here only made up 15%ish of the recent AMC buys. We can’t create those kind of volumes and price movement. It’s all manipulation… I hope you end up on the right side of it.
2021-06-05 06:27:19,wallstreetbets,I’m in at 13.92 for 1.5k shares. I’m sitting back now and watching the show.
2021-06-05 08:29:31,wallstreetbets,Been holding since 2012!
2021-06-05 08:54:38,wallstreetbets,Amc first... Don't just go there yet
2021-06-05 08:55:35,wallstreetbets,holding and buying here.
2021-06-05 09:33:52,wallstreetbets,Good luck homie!
2021-06-05 09:44:52,wallstreetbets,"
I lost both on BB and AMC"
2021-06-05 10:06:30,wallstreetbets,I’m holding like a superglue toilet prank but was in at 11 before the hedge fund bots hyped it. I fell for that and went in again. Hold and reinvested to turn the tables on them. Solid company anyway so not worried.
2021-06-05 10:07:53,wallstreetbets,I bought it at 19.  Followed the hype.  New ape here.  First investments.  Holding all the way.
2021-06-05 10:10:06,wallstreetbets,I got stop lossed out on my final set of options on Friday helps take the mental aspect out when there’s bleed out
2021-06-05 10:16:33,wallstreetbets,I added some BB and NKLA this week. Needed a little spice! BB should be a cash generator and let’s see where NKLA can take me.
2021-06-05 10:18:34,wallstreetbets,"I'm all in on GME, sorry"
2021-06-05 10:24:10,wallstreetbets,"Your strike is higher than giraffe pussy. 

We’re coming for you 🚀"
2021-06-05 10:29:58,wallstreetbets,"I took profit (tiny) last week. Then took wife and her boyfriend to dinner at Wendy's.  They were so happy that I decided to buy BB again on Monday morning so I can give them another joyful moment at Wendy's. What can I say, I'm a big heart ❤ person.  🤪"
2021-06-05 10:31:14,wallstreetbets,You are doing this wrong.
2021-06-05 10:49:44,wallstreetbets,Why are you guys buying now when the stock was $9 for so long... ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
2021-06-05 11:05:03,wallstreetbets,I'm broke down on $AMC highway at the moment. Soon as it gets going I'll swing by and pick you up! 😁

2021-06-04 21:35:58,wallstreetbets,The expression you were looking for is en masse.
2021-06-05 02:00:18,wallstreetbets,Why do you say that?

2021-06-05 12:09:38,wallstreetbets,I am currently at around $16.70 a share. Apes 🦍 must stick together.
2021-06-04 22:29:01,wallstreetbets,To the right or left of the decimal!!!!
2021-06-05 12:41:41,wallstreetbets,"Will it though. -5% from purchase price today. Kinda low-key dreading monday.

Where are all the WSB BB big mouthed apes?"
2021-06-05 12:44:35,wallstreetbets,@ -5% today.
2021-06-05 05:31:55,wallstreetbets,Same lol Monday morning imma buy some @13.86
2021-06-05 08:47:09,wallstreetbets,Same here! It’s only a loss if you sell.
2021-06-04 22:01:07,wallstreetbets,I appreciate that however.... lol I meant what I said grammatically correct or not haha
2021-06-04 20:38:23,wallstreetbets,And sell low
2021-06-05 03:41:32,wallstreetbets,they have been doing nice stuff for years now but it did not pay off. Handhelds have not been their focus for at least five years but I am only worried that they are still run by the same old school guys who prevent a real transformation
2021-06-05 19:16:32,wallstreetbets,Link please?
2021-06-04 21:41:17,wallstreetbets,"That’s what raped the AMC rally.. everyone ran options, imagine if all that money went into shares instead of thin air.. amc would’ve passed 100"
2021-06-05 12:42:35,wallstreetbets,Yea I’m definitely nervous myself. Hoping for a good Monday
2021-06-04 21:41:47,wallstreetbets,"Support level failed, now what"
2021-06-04 20:48:44,wallstreetbets,I personally like the 20 strike at 2 weeks out. That’s just my take.
2021-06-04 20:47:25,wallstreetbets,"Awesome man, beautiful. Get yourself something too!"
2021-06-04 23:48:55,wallstreetbets,I hope you make a killing!
2021-06-04 20:55:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah throwing it at hookers right away is wrong. Make a few bucks & upgrade that chunk of fez to a dime.
2021-06-05 04:09:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah exactly, but now that they dropped their phone business, they are obliged to do the transformation, but lets see, i bought some shares and i dnt mind holding them for long term.
I did it on trade republic, will shift soon to interactive brokers more professional and i guess when you buy stocks that yield dividends you get them"
2021-06-05 10:17:02,wallstreetbets,Sell some covered calls to offset these dips a bit. Sold 2 30$ calls a month out for 500 bucks
2021-06-05 10:23:08,wallstreetbets,"you are right on track

Step 1: Buy High"

2021-06-05 04:52:26,wallstreetbets,"Damn, on friday I bought 5 $10Cs at the same price, same expiry"
2021-06-05 15:04:33,wallstreetbets,Not for long I hope 😁🚀
2021-06-04 22:12:27,wallstreetbets,Look at ita deal with Amazon. It can buy millions of shares at $13. There are filling stations next to its warehouses. Anything under $13 is a deal.
2021-06-04 22:00:56,wallstreetbets,"See but what quality of life is it if you don’t enjoy the finer things, I guess in my opinion? It’s a different mindset for sure. I applaud you for getting there because I sure am not yet"
2021-06-05 05:11:46,wallstreetbets,"One of my biggest regrets is not making a few sacrifices when I was younger in order to make my future life more comfortable. Less drugs, less eating out, less impulse buying could have amounted to thousands in savings each year."
2021-06-04 23:36:05,wallstreetbets,This is the fucking shit I miss seeing on here. Not some stupid braindead fuck “yoloing” 3k on a stock that’s already up 100+% and surprised when they lose it all. Good work son
2021-06-05 00:14:37,wallstreetbets,Thanks dad.
2021-06-04 21:25:20,wallstreetbets,Y’all don’t seem to know what “synthetic shares” are
2021-06-05 01:03:40,wallstreetbets,"I think you need to read again lol. It says it’ll release the number of individual shareholders on June 9th. As in, the number of people who own at least 1 AMC stock. Nothing related to shorts, naked shorts, or synthetics."
2021-06-04 20:07:26,wallstreetbets,Closed my adjusted APHA calls yesterday when the strike passed $22 and turned a nice profit. I'll probably jump back in if it dips closer to $16-17!
2021-06-04 23:10:26,wallstreetbets,"Just spend all of your money on TLRY calls today ......rite, I did that already it's a wrap"
2021-06-04 23:37:38,wallstreetbets,I think your smooth brain deflected the true retardedness of this stupid fucking decision. tO tHe MoOn REEEEEE
2021-06-05 00:41:48,wallstreetbets,1000 shares hold n and buying at this level
2021-06-05 01:46:38,wallstreetbets,Zero exposure? Oh you mean like when Aphria and Tilray merged and Aphira has a stranglehold on the US cannabis beer market? It might not taste good to you and me but someone thinks it's delicious and that's all that matters.
2021-06-05 11:15:05,wallstreetbets,"Tilray is the largest global exporter of cannabis. You think they’re not getting taxed in other countries they plan to sell, like Germany? Not to mention, if they do import to USA, the sales tax will remain the same 😘

Think before you speak"
2021-06-05 12:03:29,wallstreetbets,........Because America only uses sale tax to control industry? Dead point.
2021-06-04 22:17:03,wallstreetbets,Wtf they removed it lol
2021-06-05 04:01:19,wallstreetbets,All in!
2021-06-05 08:48:52,wallstreetbets,The jannies are disallowing GME?  Why?
2021-06-05 08:57:58,wallstreetbets,"My guess is that the mods are bought, and immediately delete stuff related to GME. It makes no sense to me that people just stopped talking about GME yet they are still hyping AMC like crazy."
2021-06-04 22:25:00,wallstreetbets,It happened lol
2021-06-04 23:45:01,wallstreetbets,"Boys he's literally mentally retarded

2021-06-05 07:35:27,wallstreetbets,Man he totally ruined the momentum . I get his priority is saving the company but it came at the at time where we were going to run up the scoreboard
2021-06-05 10:27:13,wallstreetbets,Luv the humor on wsb! 😂😂😂
2021-06-04 20:05:34,wallstreetbets,Nothing wrong with rubbing one out right before a call. Must have been a good video on the hub and didn’t have enough time to get his pants back on. No big deal. Move on. Nothing to see here.
2021-06-04 20:44:57,wallstreetbets,Whatever it takes to get you not talking about the insider stock sales today lol.
2021-06-04 20:58:58,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you retards take some shit head billionaire boomer not wearing pants to mean “he’s in on it!” explains people shocked the stock is down 15%  and not $1,000."

2021-06-05 01:42:18,wallstreetbets,"Well, I might give a try myself🤣"
2021-06-05 01:56:30,wallstreetbets,Balls so big they don’t make pants to fit them.. that’s someone I’d follow to the moon
2021-06-05 02:20:45,wallstreetbets,"God damn, when I’m feeling lazy I just put on basketball shorts. Dude is a legend, rich as fuck, refuses thigh coverage"
2021-06-05 02:30:12,wallstreetbets,This just makes me feel like I'm more in touch with AMC as a company so I'm just going to keep the stocks forever
2021-06-05 02:35:17,wallstreetbets,"Very ballsy, confirmed showman."
2021-06-05 03:43:59,wallstreetbets,Naked shorts. Buy more. Buy him a Versace at 100
2021-06-05 03:54:12,wallstreetbets,Would you be wearing pants if a bunch of apes put you back on track with a ton of financing to rebuild with
2021-06-05 04:34:44,wallstreetbets,As an Ape 🦍 I don't like his banana 🍌

2021-06-05 19:15:37,wallstreetbets,Telling us low key top secret that there is naked shorts in amc.
2021-06-05 01:09:25,wallstreetbets,Adam arons a short! Gave the management bonus to the shorts to exit their position and that’s probably the same room he collected his 3.75 million bonus in February on his coach from investor stimis he stole from investor while being a short collecting 6 billion in debt. Remeber amc was meant to be short to shit. When your only catalyst is it’s being shorted bahahha that’s should tell you something about how you invest. This is a once ever you hold and hope with amc trash. Oops sorry to much truth
2021-06-05 01:49:33,wallstreetbets,"Ya'll praising this man and acting like he didn't just single handedly stop the squeeze from occurring with his incredibly coincidental backdoor dilution deals.

2021-06-04 20:31:57,wallstreetbets,This guy is a genius his announcement that amc is a risky stock where you could lose all your money is just to avoid lawsuits and this was obviously rehearsed as if a ceo’s camera was gonna fall like that he wanted to send the subliminal message of naked shorts to the moon am buying more
2021-06-04 20:52:44,wallstreetbets,This is the way! Buying more AMC.
2021-06-05 10:16:22,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, why would you use pants in the title... ""naked shorts"". You failed hard."
2021-06-04 20:55:43,wallstreetbets,It almost looked like it was done on purpose the way the camera fell.  He is just showing us he is an APE too🦍🦍
2021-06-04 21:02:23,wallstreetbets,"Workhorse currently has a 42% short float which could cause a short squeeze. The support is around $13.00 with bulls still in control of the chart. This is similar to AMC because the higher the short interest the higher the squeeze will go. For example, shorts borrow shares from a broker for a fee. This is possible because people buy shares and don’t set limit orders. This is why it is important to set limit orders high so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. The shorts then sell your shares that they just borrowed for a fee to then sell on the open market driving the price down. Shorts make money by selling the shares back to the broker at a lower price as well as making money through buying put options. A short squeeze happens when shorts have to buy back their shares that they borrowed from a broker at a higher price. We can accelerate a short squeeze through buying the shares and setting a limit order high above the ask so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. This will cause the stock price to go up which will cause shorts to buy back the shares that they borrowed causing a “short squeeze”. For example, if we buy WKHS at “market price”, such as $13.00, it will cause the stock price to go up at which point shorts will need to cover their positions or risk being margin called which means that the broker can automatically close out the short’s position which will cause them to buy back those shares at “market price” which is often much higher then when they borrowed them which causes the shorts to lose their money by handing it over us as we sell our shares when the price is above $100/share. 🐴💰"

2021-06-05 02:55:04,wallstreetbets,"That’s fair, but the pattern it’s taking on looks like a lot of other stocks out there that are season-dependent on a narrower timeframe. 

When a stock is cheap and it jumps 20% and drops 20% over and over, that’s not indicative of a squeeze, IMO. That’s just smart money playing the market."
2021-06-05 02:45:11,wallstreetbets,"“Now AMC?” There’s nothing left to squeeze. That’s why it didn’t/hasn’t skyrocketed like GME did. Once the non-Redditors see that it’s hit a narrow ceiling and floor where they bought in, they’re going to jump ship. 

You’re better off shorting AMC yourself. Their fundamentals are atrocious, they own very little real estate and are broadly leasing space in dying malls, they’re completely underwater, and now they’re poised to dilute their shares as soon as their quarterly numbers start coming in and people see the impact of home release movies. They exist only to pay off their debt at this point. They are a non-solvent company."
2021-06-04 23:50:45,wallstreetbets,Yes the mods did. Mods put up a link outside of WSB to get rid of GME Apes and the link was to another site. Message was clear.

2021-06-05 03:01:49,wallstreetbets,"20%? It’s tripled and retracted back 55-58% 4 times now. This is the 5th. This wave suggests 35-40$ peak depending on how you calculate the daily share price. 17.50-19.50 should be the new floor after this spike. 

They added weeklies a month ago to help the shorts get out of their positions more gracefully and dampen the violent nature of the spike."
2021-06-05 02:55:10,wallstreetbets,"I think they meant ""now"" as in the past few days."
2021-06-05 14:32:56,wallstreetbets,"Cost/benefit doesn't add up. If Chen really did that, and if the truth got out, his flawless reputation would he ruined forever. Or he could slowly but surely guide BB to victory (AWS partnership and all) and collect that $30-price bonus in a few years. The guy is a smooth and patient operator."
2021-06-05 05:05:51,wallstreetbets,"The link was very explicitly to ""a new GME megathread"" in response to the anger that there wasn't going to be a perpetual GME megathread.

Aka: if you want a permanent GME megathread, a different subreddit is appropriate."
2021-06-05 00:52:00,wallstreetbets,"The shorts that currently exist are more than enough for a massive squeeze. This is good, it means they can’t short at the first sign of a dip, to then make some back when it dips further from some sell offs."
2021-06-04 20:54:52,wallstreetbets,He did fairly recently. He completely nailed how GME played out in January.
2021-06-04 23:05:50,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. They created the best automotive LiDAR on the planet from scratch, and have enough cash on hand to run for years. As well, their “dismal” earnings call don’t reflect any of the revenue from the IVAS contract."
2021-06-05 07:45:40,wallstreetbets,Thanks Dude. 6 to 7 fold in a matter of 3 - 4 days looks like a squeeze for me…
2021-06-05 14:35:30,wallstreetbets,"Why would his reputation be ruined? The SEC might come after him, sure, but if I'm a shareholder then hell yes I'd like a CEO to do whatever he can to get the stock price higher--especially if it was trading below its fair value like BB arguably is."
2021-06-05 07:03:20,wallstreetbets,They can't be deleting both AMC and BB at the same time
2021-06-05 07:05:03,wallstreetbets,Well your brains gonna be off for a long time.
2021-06-04 22:03:17,wallstreetbets,The sub has gotten questionable after 2mill. SPY puts and TSLA were great during the lockdowns.
2021-06-04 20:38:52,wallstreetbets,"From what I read, AMC might sell 25m more shares in 2022, if that move is approved at the next shareholder meeting. If that's what you're referring to, then there's over 6 months before that even comes into play, if everything goes according to plan. And I'm honestly not sure how much the business fundamentals matter at this point. If there's a ton of unreported short interest, and if shareholders hold until the shorts have to cover, then the share prices are bound to go up. The only thing required is for a lot of shareholders (and/or well-financed shareholders) to know that there is enough short interest for the buyback to be worth the wait. And I feel like that's the situation we're in. Evidence like the recent price action and Jefferies restricting short selling signals that there is indeed a lot of unreported short interest. Besides, I think GameStop, at least, has some promising changes in the works for its business fundamentals. (I don't know much about Microvision.) You mention GameStop's price having gone down, but bear in mind that large amounts of short selling will drive the price down temporarily. And again, we have increasing evidence of a large number of short positions, yet GME is still around $250. If people are confident that a large forced buy-in is coming, why would they decide to sell en masse before that happens? Furthermore, why would long shareholders change course now, after several months of waiting patiently? What's changed? Not AMC's fundamentals, right? And their next stock sell-off is proposed for next year. And Jefferies' recent change should be encouraging for long shareholders, not discouraging. So what's changed recently to make a bunch of people stop holding after all these months?"
2021-06-05 06:49:42,wallstreetbets,Who the fucc dresses up at the movies?
2021-06-05 15:45:57,wallstreetbets,"Because there are different types of CEOs. :) Some are rabid clowns like Elon Musk. Some are serious quiet professionals like Chen. It's kind of like... the difference between Deadpool and John Wick. They're both very good at what they do, but they go about it very differently.

If you spent your whole life working on the public persona of a quiet and serious professional, and then get caught spending $100 on Fiverr to generate a bunch of fake DD posts on wsb... Well, that's a god-awful cost/benefit ratio LOL - especially if BB will reach $30 eventually organically, once the AWS revenue starts coming in, in 2022 or more likely 2023. Just not worth it."

2021-06-04 21:04:24,wallstreetbets,"WKHS - Workhorse currently has a 42% short float which could cause a short squeeze. The support is around $13.00 with bulls still in control of the chart. This is similar to AMC because the higher the short interest the higher the squeeze will go. For example, shorts borrow shares from a broker for a fee. This is possible because people buy shares and don’t set limit orders. This is why it is important to set limit orders high so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. The shorts then sell your shares that they just borrowed for a fee to then sell on the open market driving the price down. Shorts make money by selling the shares back to the broker at a lower price as well as making money through buying put options. A short squeeze happens when shorts have to buy back their shares that they borrowed from a broker at a higher price. We can accelerate a short squeeze through buying the shares and setting a limit order high above the ask so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. This will cause the stock price to go up which will cause shorts to buy back the shares that they borrowed causing a “short squeeze”. For example, if we buy WKHS at “market price”, such as $13.00, it will cause the stock price to go up at which point shorts will need to cover their positions or risk being margin called which means that the broker can automatically close out the short’s position which will cause them to buy back those shares at “market price” which is often much higher then when they borrowed them which causes the shorts to lose their money by handing it over us as we sell our shares when the price is above $100/share."

2021-06-04 22:06:56,wallstreetbets,"It only happens after a large enough group call the mods out for it, it allows them to argue against the reality of them suppressing GME talk when it fits the narrative for margin call prevention from FOMO from mass retail volume

&#x200B;

\*edit\* notice how they allow it Friday after needing to keep it under 250 and succeeded?   
You'll never see a GME post make top during a ramp up, only after successful prevention of a key price range for margin calls by end of options chain"
2021-06-05 04:01:54,wallstreetbets,“What an edgy comment”
2021-06-04 22:02:38,wallstreetbets,"Do you think AMC was hedge fund plan to weaken retail money - so instead of all on GME now BB, GME, AMC and others?"

2021-06-04 23:03:40,wallstreetbets,Thanks !
2021-06-05 01:10:34,wallstreetbets,"As long as a post isn't being over the top, doesn't go too far into conspiracy land, and doesn't link to outside Subreddits, any GME post should be fine. It's just that most of the posts fall into one of those three categories or is simply a lazy post.

Do I think WSB could be more lenient on GME stuff? Yes, but at the same time, the people posting about it have to take a step back and look at what they're actually publishing."
2021-06-04 22:14:53,wallstreetbets,"Its possible since GME was up steady without many people noticed because of so many noise from BB and AMC. If there was no BB/AMC then I think GME may go up alot more.

If BB/AMC is Hedge Fund's Plan then I think they also got another Plan next week for GME because there is Investor Meeting. Next week gonna be very interesting."

2021-06-04 22:24:39,wallstreetbets,"Damn, sounds like we are getting plaid, and the media (fox) maybe just building faze confidence airing our rep."
2021-06-04 20:01:16,wallstreetbets,"The magnitude of the effects of the surprise(s) are not known so they’re not priced in.  My experience does tell me that buy on rumor and sell on news will cause a momentary dip as the pressure and hype built up on anticipation of the meeting is released after it is done. Then the stock will recover.

However this stock has behaved paradoxically so i am not confident of my forecast."
2021-06-04 22:57:18,wallstreetbets,"But you said anyone buying at $250 is going to be a long-term bag holder...

Not really sure if you truly believe that why you wouldn't short the stock. Seems like easy money."
2021-06-05 04:29:08,wallstreetbets,"My long position?
321 shares at an average of 99,92 dollars. I have been averaging up dramatically by buying at 200/250+.

My average used to be 37"
2021-06-05 00:25:40,wallstreetbets,"We all know where the price is going to end up sooner or later just not worth the risks of it shooting up in price momentarily due to retail FOMO and getting margin called when you can just buy puts, get much better leverage and return, without the risk. Also shorting isn't always available to average investors, you can only do it when your broker has shares available. But you can always buy puts. It's not like I'm a hedge fund lol I'm just a retail investor and puts or actually more specifically put debit spreads, serve my purposes best here."

https://www.ftserussell.com/resources/russell-reconstitution
There you have to check Russell 3000 preliminary additions 2021. You will see clover on the list.
Russell 2000 is made with the 2000 smaller stocks of Russell 3000 because the index represents the small and mid caps of the 3000. They take out the 1000 biggest companies like Alphabet to make an index based on small caps. So, they can correct some details (not definitely list) but usually this list almost the same as the final one. Read my other comment here if you want to know some interesting data. I check everything I said myself. If you want some link of any information I posted on the other comment tell me and I will share the link to the official websites where I found the information."

2021-06-05 00:27:30,wallstreetbets,Those are fake contracts created in the dark pool by HF 🤫🥴
2021-06-05 12:25:13,wallstreetbets,"My bet is that this was a large insurance contract taken out by a short holder as a hedge during a fast upward movement on the stock. Once the momentum died, they closed the position. It probably cost them some money, but it that's how insurance works. The MM was happy to scalp the premiums."
2021-06-05 05:53:45,wallstreetbets,"No. Please take that shit down. Simply having contracts up for sale does not affect volume. Christ this sub has more misinformation than a Trump campaign.

Open interest is how many OPEN contracts there are. Someone bought a call or put and hasn't closed it out yet.

Volume is how many transactions there have been today.

If you buy a call and then sell it, there are 2 transactions added to the volume for the day. Open interest went +1 when you bought it and -1 when you sold it."
2021-06-04 20:59:07,wallstreetbets,"So can you explain to me why some options have zero volume, some o/I, but there's a bid and ask price with ""x quantity"". Shouldnt it have zero bid and ask price x quantity since the volume is zero? Ty"
2021-06-05 11:42:34,wallstreetbets,"There was 173k volume though, that means they traded hands. My bet is that they were a hedge held by somebody short who would have been liquidated with too big a move. 

Like you said, MMs were happy to scalp the premium, and the short seller was happy to buy the insurance. I think this had nothing to do with retail traders."
2021-06-05 13:15:52,wallstreetbets,"Edited with a screenshot. So you're saying every option above $125 at the time of that screen had no interest at all, but had already been purchased (Volume) times? Also how is there a bid if no open interest?

Not my screenshot, and not trolling, genuinely want to know if I'm wrong. I got a lot of awards and upvotes so I'm conflicted."
2021-06-05 02:10:13,wallstreetbets,I feel for him and wish him all the good luck and fortune next time
2021-06-05 14:15:33,wallstreetbets,"Could be the numbers on your screenshot aren't accurate. But maybe they are. More than likely, what you're seeing here is that every open contract was closed by eod because spending $55 on a call and hoping for it to hit $125 the next day would be dumb as shit. All the buys and sells throughout the day add to the volume but because everyone got rid of their hopeless calls, the OI is zero."
2021-06-05 09:39:18,wallstreetbets,End up with $42...
2021-06-05 15:09:24,wallstreetbets,"That seems unlikely though, because in order to close it there has to be a buyer no? Otherwise it just expires worthless. Or does Open Interest reflect only available buyers / bids? 

Agreed on it being dumb as shit though. Either way appreciate the replies."
2021-06-04 20:53:46,wallstreetbets,"How do you rent a contract? I thought you can only buy to close or buy to open, sell to open, sell to close, I never heard of rent to open/close contract."

Here is one more tidbit. This stock is going under $40.. Why? Because there is a crap ton of ITM call options on June 18th. They are going short this shit down to $30.
2021-06-04 23:40:45,wallstreetbets,"Not arsed.

2021-06-04 20:57:35,wallstreetbets,Exactly- I’m a construction manager and summer is the best time for building anything that effects DOT roadways due to weather related regulations- but I’m being told by my contractors that we won’t get the materials we need for the job until halfway through the summer and we can’t meet DOT deadlines to be out of the roadways. I was able to negotiate a contractor with a supplier of materials directly to get an early delivery of pipe for my highest priority project but the rest of the projects are all facing the same shortages. We’re looking at a potential sewage in the streets situation if we can’t fix the supply chain that’s been impacted by other countries that are still overwhelmed with COVID and their factories are shut down. Either the USA gets vaccines to these places or we invest in manufacturing here- but either solution probably won’t save all my construction jobs- it’s likely some will need to be pushed to next summer or I’ll have to substitute materials and work with regulators.
2021-06-05 01:57:56,wallstreetbets,Have you been smoking?
2021-06-04 21:03:17,wallstreetbets,"Yea but people who work in these beach towns at these small businesses tend to be Eastern Europeans on visas for the summer who are willing to live in group housing together. I’ve a house in OC MD and we rely on foreign workers every summer in addition to local high school kids and other locals. The issue with beach towns is workers need a place to stay that costs low enough that their wages are profitable. Beach towns don’t have a lot of affordable housing unless the visa program or employer provides it. The lifeguards at the beach are paid really well and given lifeguard housing, but without a surplus of either college kids or foreign workers on visas willing to live in group housing and work for less at the resteraunts, you’ll be seeing help wanted signs and hour long waits all summer long."

2021-06-04 21:06:05,wallstreetbets,"WKHS - 🐎 Workhorse currently has a 42% short float which could cause a short squeeze. The support is around $13.00 with bulls still in control of the chart. This is similar to AMC because the higher the short interest the higher the squeeze will go. For example, shorts borrow shares from a broker for a fee. This is possible because people buy shares and don’t set limit orders. This is why it is important to set limit orders high so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. The shorts then sell your shares that they just borrowed for a fee to then sell on the open market driving the price down. Shorts make money by selling the shares back to the broker at a lower price as well as making money through buying put options. A short squeeze happens when shorts have to buy back their shares that they borrowed from a broker at a higher price. We can accelerate a short squeeze through buying the shares and setting a limit order high above the ask so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. This will cause the stock price to go up which will cause shorts to buy back the shares that they borrowed causing a “short squeeze”. For example, if we buy WKHS at “market price”, such as $13.00, it will cause the stock price to go up at which point shorts will need to cover their positions or risk being margin called which means that the broker can automatically close out the short’s position which will cause them to buy back those shares at “market price” which is often much higher then when they borrowed them which causes the shorts to lose their money by handing it over us as we sell our shares when the price is above $100/share. 🐴"
2021-06-05 12:38:18,wallstreetbets,"Except inflation. Divide that percentage by annual inflation rate to get the actual value in today's terms at the end of a year. The most optimistic current global inflation rate I've seen is 2%. Over the last 80 years, global inflation rates have on average halved every 20 years. Assuming the trend continues, which is not guaranteed, sequencing that to 1000 years means you lose value for 41 years until inflation hits 0.5%, make back the value at 116 years if inflation has continued to drop to 0.0385%, and will reach a total of the equivalent of $75.63 in today's money at year 1000. If inflation doesn't decrease fast enough or plateaus, kiss that value goodbye."

2021-06-05 06:32:31,wallstreetbets,I was referring to the low interest on savings making it better to spend than to receive 0.1% interest per year but yeah I suppose it also applies to interest on debt too.

You can double your money just selling the contract to someone else pretty easily with even a modest upswing in share price, even if its still nowhere near the strike.

example: I bought 1.50 SNDL calls for 2.00 each on tuesday. Sold them wednesday for like 12.00 each. 600% profit. never hit my strike."
2021-06-05 03:02:02,wallstreetbets,Well it didn't happen
2021-06-04 20:32:59,wallstreetbets,Lol or just know how to do basic addition
2021-06-04 20:03:36,wallstreetbets,I guess. Seems to me like they hedged their shorts with longer duration out of the money calls to protect themselves. That is why the short interest hasn't changed much. They can afford to wait as long as it takes or until their options expire lol.
2021-06-05 09:29:37,wallstreetbets,"What am I missing here? New to options, but I bought .50 SNDL calls for Jan 23 for .68 a few weeks ago, and they're only worth .90 now?"
2021-06-05 08:44:04,wallstreetbets,Rug pull lol
2021-06-04 20:57:39,wallstreetbets,why do math when the answer is readily available?
2021-06-05 10:10:12,wallstreetbets,"My calls were for $1.50 way out of the money and they were FDs that expired friday so they were dirt cheap. Earlier this week there was a huge run up that peaked at 1.49 per share. Almost putting my calls in the money.  This made them desireable because for a few hours the volatility and share price made it appear those could were going to go in the money so that dirt cheap premium shot up from 2cents to a peak of like 28c.

Your calls are already itm so they are only worth approximately as much as youd make executing them, plus a little extra premium for the long duration. 

The difference between the growth of your calls and mine last week was that mine began practically worthless. They were awful, betting on 150% growth in 3 days. BUT THAT SHIT HAPPENED. When SNDL was hovering around 1.40 with momentum people suddenly wanted 1.50 calls. 

tldr: Far OTM calls with a short expiration (FDs) and a cheap premium really pop off when the share price doubles in a day. Most of the time they expire worthless though, because stocks almost never move that much. The guy who bought my 1.50 calls for example still lost all of his money because they never actually made it ITM. I was just lucky to buy them like 2 hours before SNDL exploded last week and the premium on those increased 10x based on the possibility of them going ITM increasing so much. The downside is these are extremely risky because FDs are a longshot bet that lose 99.9% of the time. But they hit big with big price movements because they start off so damn cheap."
2021-06-05 08:46:03,wallstreetbets,Give it one more chance
2021-06-05 10:38:34,wallstreetbets,"I guess where I'm confused is the price. I watch options all day lately (granted while I'm working, and on lots of different stocks to learn, so what I mean is I check many of them periodically throughout the day) and I can't imagine seeing SNDL 1.50 calls being at $12. Even $2 seems high when the stock has been between .60-1.50 for weeks. I don't ever recall seeing them at $2, let alone $12. I'm not saying they never were, just that I can't even fathom that.

For instance, 1.50 calls for this week are .08, and further OTM calls just get cheaper from there as expected. How were the calls you bought pre-volatility spike 2.00 for 1.50 strike that was, at the time, far OTM? And who in their right mind would pay $12 for calls expiring that week on a stock worth 1.40 something? If this were AMC or something maybe I could see that.

At first I thought maybe you meant you bought $2 worth of options, and then sold them for $12, I can see that easy, but your post says each call.

Something just isn't adding up here, and I'm assuming it's me just missing something.

Edit: Just figured out what you mean. $2 per contract, NOT $2 per share. LMAO. All is well, ignore me. I was confused because TD Ameritrade lists the price as per share, so I'm currently seeing $1.50 strikes at $.08, but of course that would cost you $8 per call."

2021-06-05 00:59:56,wallstreetbets,I’ve been holding workhorse sense last year. Really great company and doesn’t deserve to be manipulated like this at all. It’s all American company that’s trying to better the world and has been getting screwed over. We need to beat these people trying to kill this company.
2021-06-04 21:08:49,wallstreetbets,"Workhorse currently has a 42% short float which could cause a short squeeze. The support is around $13.00 with bulls still in control of the chart. This is similar to AMC because the higher the short interest the higher the squeeze will go. For example, shorts borrow shares from a broker for a fee. This is possible because people buy shares and don’t set limit orders. This is why it is important to set limit orders high so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. The shorts then sell your shares that they just borrowed for a fee to then sell on the open market driving the price down. Shorts make money by selling the shares back to the broker at a lower price as well as making money through buying put options. A short squeeze happens when shorts have to buy back their shares that they borrowed from a broker at a higher price. We can accelerate a short squeeze through buying the shares and setting a limit order high above the ask so that shorts can’t borrow your shares. This will cause the stock price to go up which will cause shorts to buy back the shares that they borrowed causing a “short squeeze”. For example, if we buy WKHS at “market price”, such as $13.00, it will cause the stock price to go up at which point shorts will need to cover their positions or risk being margin called which means that the broker can automatically close out the short’s position which will cause them to buy back those shares at “market price” which is often much higher then when they borrowed them which causes the shorts to lose their money by handing it over us as we sell our shares when the price is above $100/share. 🐎💰"

I finally rotated profits out of tech this week into energy: mostly into XLE, OIH, XOP, IXC for international exposure, and SLB since -- real prospects aside -- it will benefit from fund flows into ETF's. Also looking into XES. Spending tonight googling through Reddit to find more info about this sector because I'm a kewl guy."
