2021-05-08 19:11:46,wallstreetbets,"I think the companies listed here are solid and have the potential to impact the world. However, I would note that price/valuation are also very important when constructing a stock portfolio and should be taken into consideration. For example, I think everyone can agree that Tesla has done a lot to change the world and has made a real impact...but I don’t think everyone would want to own Tesla at current levels given current valuation and all-time high multiples"
2021-05-08 19:42:55,wallstreetbets,I definitely believe in Costco

2021-05-08 19:14:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the stocks after high conviction are weighted under 25% of the portfolio. The initial 7 will weight over 60-70%.

My view is that Tesla will eventually take the number one spot and approach 4 trillion market cap before Apple does."
2021-05-08 19:45:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, Cotsco, Apple, and Berkshire are roughly the same idea. 

The businesses do the work for the customer by holding high standards to provide good value and customer service. The value is in the quality and that's pretty hard to beat."
2021-05-08 19:56:43,wallstreetbets,"Costco is a great companies to work for, they pay very well and the benefits are great also. Taking care of the employees is so unbelievably important in my opinion."
2021-05-08 19:39:15,wallstreetbets,"Depends what you want to invest in the network space.  I don't really view fastly and Cloudflare as competitors and this was recently started by Matt Prince himself in the last earnings report.

To put it simply, investing in Fastly is for realtime services while Cloudflare is for general networking. In that regard, I would rather just invest in Amazon or Google."

I'd be worried if he cashed outbof every share he owns but thats not the case. Pltr is constantly in the news regarding new constracts or continuation of olf contracts.

2021-05-08 18:56:31,wallstreetbets,"Probably won't move the needle much.  Analysts are expecting 4 cents earnings per share.  For a company valued at $37 billion dollars this just shows just how diluted the shares really are (1.8 billion shares outstanding).

Even if PLTR beats the estimate by 25% (1 cent), it won't look very impressive at all for a $37 billion company ($18 million above estimates).

The only way PLTR stock will pop big on earnings is if they really crush it by 200-300%.  I don't see that happening."

2021-05-08 19:21:02,wallstreetbets,">when it breaks its 50-day MA

Here comes crayon expert Mr. Nostradamus of modern stock market. Tell me Mr. Charty, what is so special about this 50 day moving average filter? What exactly happens in the price of a stock that you can determine by this 50-day MA? And, why 50 days? Why not 120 days or 365 days? Let's say a stock goes over it's 50-day MA, what will happen then? I am getting from your comment that it will be the beginning of an uptrend. Now tell me how long this uptrend will last? 10 days? 1 month? 3 months? What determines that duration of that uptrend? Because I have seen stock price last over it's 50-day MA for all random days to even month. I have also seen SP goes up above that line one day and then the next day it falls below and keep dancing around for a while. Some stays above 3-4 days and then goes down and stays there for some random days. 

Tell me once PLTR breaks it's 50-day MA, how long will it last? How fast will it rise from that point and when it will start falling below again so that I can buy calls on those uptrend days and puts and those downtrend days. 

Teach me master, I beg you please!"

So maybe we see headlines comparing a negative GAAP EPS to these positive non-GAAP estimates, and people freak out first."
2021-05-08 19:29:51,wallstreetbets,"Wow lol.

I simply use it as an indicator for if the stock is in an upward trend or a downward trend. Do you want to buy something in a downward trend or an upward trend? The 200-day is an even better indicator. If it's going sideways, then there is a lot better stocks to look at. [Stockcharts.com](https://Stockcharts.com) is your friend.  Not the random BS charts Robinhood gives you. It's called momentum and you don't want to be on the wrong side of it, JMHO.  I don't claim to have a crystal ball but I wouldn't buy anything below the 200-ma and certainly when its below both the 50 and 200.  Keep thumbing through the Financials and your ""DD"" but people much, much smarter, and with a LOT more money, have already put in their bets and you're just trying to be on the right side of the trend, not pick tops and bottoms.  You seriously don't think algo's are using the MAs as buy/sell price points? Pull up 20 charts on [Stockcharts.com](https://Stockcharts.com) and see if you can't step back, take a breath, and see how they obey the MAs. But hey man, maybe your crystal ball is a lot better than mine.

Why would u want to buy a stock below the 200-day MA on the daily, and especially on the weekly? Are you trying to outsmart everyone else? Again, people who do this for an actual career and have inside sources and placing orders much bigger than me and you.  Follow the trend.  I have no idea how long a trend will last. That's not the point. Use it as a place to enter and exit a trade is all I'm saying.  There's 1000's of stocks in upward trends that are better than PLTR."

Especially during a squeeze is it easier to unload calls at a way higher premium due to implied volatility. Call and put option liquidity is not an issue."
2021-05-08 17:34:58,wallstreetbets,"I would suggest reading up on option pricing, greeks, and options in general (intrinsic and extrinsic values in particular).

2021-05-08 17:49:29,wallstreetbets,I am talking about $270 per share.
2021-05-08 17:57:21,wallstreetbets,"he probably means he fears lack of liquidity. and it's justified. I have no ideea if it's the case here, but options before expiration can be illiquid when deep ITM."
2021-05-08 18:18:11,wallstreetbets,Good to hear.
2021-05-08 17:44:19,wallstreetbets,I am not talking about exercising the option.  I am talking about selling it.  I have some calls with zero cash to actually exercise the options to buy.
2021-05-08 17:47:38,wallstreetbets,"I understand that, but in a situation where you own only calls and have zero cash to exercise them."
2021-05-08 17:36:46,wallstreetbets,AMC was around $3 when I bought em the week before the Wed rocket
2021-05-08 17:59:11,wallstreetbets,"Which ends up being $27k per option.  

The answer is yes, you will get a good price.  Even with just 2 days left, the price will vary based on market sentiment. If the price has been moving down you will get less than if the market was moving up.

If you buy one $30 call, there are 100 underlying shares. If the underlying stock price is 300, you will get around $270 per share, or $27k total. Again, price on its way up, you get more then that. Price on its way down, less."
2021-05-08 17:51:52,wallstreetbets,What?
2021-05-08 18:11:24,wallstreetbets,"You are now getting everyone confused.

When GME was trading at $300, the $30 strike call would be worth $270 at the expiry (the buyer, if there was one, would pay $27,000 for that 1 call). A few days out, the price would be different. At the share price of $270, that call would be worth $240 at the expiry, i.e. $24,000 in actual money. 

However, it is worth how much someone is willing to pay for it at any given time. You will never sell one for more than the highest bid. You also do not want your calls expire in the money if you do not intend on owning the stock or don’t have the money to pay for it (depending on your broker, they may liquidate your contracts before the expiry with an automatic market order if you don’t have sufficient funds in your account to exercise the calls).

Like I said in my previous, read up on options. There is a lot of information online."
2021-05-08 17:55:21,wallstreetbets,"If you sell the CALL when ITM, you just make profit plus your premium back.

Its not equivalent to selling 100 shares but its much more profitable."
2021-05-08 18:16:01,wallstreetbets,"That’s true. I kind of addressed it in part of my other reply somewhere below (at the moment):

However, it is worth how much someone is willing to pay for it at any given time. You will never sell one for more than the highest bid. You also do not want your calls expire in the money if you do not intend on owning the stock or don’t have the money to pay for it (depending on your broker, they may liquidate your contracts before the expiry with an automatic market order if you don’t have sufficient funds in your account to exercise the calls)."
2021-05-08 17:54:33,wallstreetbets,"$270 x 100 shares is about $27,000.  I was using the per share figure.  I know a contract represents 100 shares, not one."
2021-05-08 17:56:08,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, lol."
2021-05-08 18:45:08,wallstreetbets,"or simply always sell when less then 30 days to expiration. you'll have liquidity then even if deep ITM. No point in holding because when deep ITM the time value will be very very low, so it's like holding the actual stock."
2021-05-08 17:55:55,wallstreetbets,"Okay, what is your question? How easy is it to offload a call option during a squeeze?"
2021-05-08 18:52:55,wallstreetbets,"But the guy probably thinks it will “moon” two days before expiration during the “squeeze”. If not then, definitely on Friday afternoon; perhaps, right before close. Lol."
2021-05-08 18:00:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes.  For example if GME was at $300, the buyer of the $30 call could offer me like only $25,000 and immediately cash it in for $30,000.  I would be making less profit than if I was in a cash position to exercise the options myself.  Is that typical?"
2021-05-08 18:04:02,wallstreetbets,"You’re not trading with other traders, don’t think of trading as a deal made with another human being. On the other side of trades are the market makers. 

Anyways, at 300 share price, the 30 call would be at least selling for 27k+."
2021-05-08 19:14:03,wallstreetbets,"Your understanding is correct and that is typical. You're getting a lot of strange answers here because people are missing the point of your question, but with very illiquid options, the bid price may not fully reflect the intrinsic value of the underlying shares. In that case, you may be better off having the cash ready to exercise and sell the shares to capture that full intrinsic value. E.g. getting the full 27K stock value rather than the 25K option bid price offered by the MM in your example."
2021-05-08 18:56:21,wallstreetbets,"It would be at least purchasable for 27k+ but not necessarily saleable for 27k+, which is what OP is concerned about. Deep ITM options don't always have enough liquidity to offer 100% of the intrinsic value at the bid price. It may be better to exercise and sell rather than sell the option.

2021-05-08 19:24:23,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like I would need to quickly sell only some options and then use that cash to start exercising others.  I just know that if I was in such a situation without having thought it through in advance, I may make the wrong decision under the pressure of time."
2021-05-08 19:01:19,wallstreetbets,It would sell as the MM would buy and hedge accordingly to make profit off the buy. You arnt selling to another option trader. It would sell instantly.
2021-05-08 19:06:03,wallstreetbets,Yes it would sell.. but not always for intrinsic value. It may be more valuable to exercise for certain deep itm options.

2021-05-08 15:08:56,wallstreetbets,"I'd like to add this

Somebody mentioned SKLZ and last time I lost shorting it bcs of Cathie buying 2m of it in a day.

Looking more into it since she's been adding very heavily over the past few days, like insanely heavy. Cathie's holdings as of last night.

SKLZ = 8.2M (ARKW) + 12.8M (ARKK) = 21M. Shares float = 149.42M. % of float = 14%. Short % float = 30.34%

Other comparison is TDOC = 4M (ARKG) + 1.8M (ARKW) + 8.5M (ARKK) =14.3M. Shares Float = 153M. % of float = 9.34%. Short % Float = 11%

Cathie's trying to short squeeze SKLZ or something. borrow fee is 4.6% so probably not yet.

Choppy week upcoming with lots of growth earnings so I'd like to wait for that upside confirmation before making a play. If Cathie keeps buying this week it might break the 17 mark easily. At 14% shares float ownership it might be the highest percentage wise of ark holdings I've ever seen.

Edit: also adding that with 1m+ purchases a day she represents around 5% of daily trading volume recently"

That being said, aside from PLTR COIN, this is the first time I've seen consistent very heavy buying from her. Day after day after day of 1m+ shares with no in between. This is like her hail mary of some sort. It's also probably one of the most shorted of her holdings.

2021-05-08 19:59:21,wallstreetbets,Amen. I stick to the classics.
2021-05-08 16:23:05,wallstreetbets,"No, this is a misconception and a very common one around here. High short % essentially means that hedge funds think the stock is shit atm, or highly overvalued, and therefore bring it down by shorting it and selling it. In almost all instances, a heavily shorted stock will go to the crapper and you should usually not touch it. 

The thing is, and this is very important, and what people in WSB are obsessed with for some reason, is that a heavily shorted stock can cause what is known as a short squeeze when something unexpected happens. For example with GME, its was extremely shorted, so when it went up hedges had to cover and pushed up the price even higher, which triggered even more stop losses, pushing the stop price higher, triggering more stop losses, pushing the stock price higher, etc etc.. it’s a chain reaction. 

This only happens very, very, very rarely and only when some huge news come out (that’s why GME is not going to squeeze again, everything that ahd to be said has been said), and most of the time a heavily shorted stock will go down hard and fast. If you believe in its fundamentals (I’m bullish on SKLLZ, you can use this huge dips to build a position for the long term, but be wary that it will probably keep going down in the short term after you buy it). Only do it if you are in for the long run."
2021-05-08 16:55:54,wallstreetbets,Thanks for that. Appreciate it. And I believe in SKILLZ. Done enough DD to know it’s price should be in the 20s at least. Been averaging down every time it’s dips 10% or around $3. Got in at $21 and will keep buying the more it dips. It’s a steal at $13-15 in my opinion.
2021-05-08 17:09:47,wallstreetbets,Agreed. It's a game of chicken and war behind the scenes of long vs short. Wait it out and keep it in a watchlist

Short biotech and small cap growth companies until they have to release shares/dilute in order to raise capital to fund advertising or commercial production of their life changing product, yet they have to dilute 10-100x more shares due to how extraordinarily manipulated their share prices are compared to what it should legitimately be.

If you have 10k in life savings, you do not gamble with 5k. You gamble with 500. You split the rest in conservative and more progressive investments.  The 500 can generate you 2k if you do well and from there you rebalance.

Our capitalist system is not designed for monkeys to become tailless great apes. Even with an education, the decent jobs it leads to pay unlivable wages. So what’s left? RISK. 

*Risk is the only way out.*

You’ll lose on most, but need to hit just one to get enough financial momentum. That’ll happen eventually if you don’t quit. It took me about $35k in losses and 3 years. The stock market is the absolute best place to take these risks too, because unlike a casino, you won’t lose everything on one roll, and, you can protect yourself with options. 

Here’s some grade-school math: Let’s say I have $1k to trade with. A 1% gain is $10. What about $100k to trade with? A 1% gain is $1000 Taking the same risk as the small guy, the big guy is making 100x more. Imagine the disparity of this over a long time period! The only way to close the gap is fuckin’ risk bruh.

""Scared money don't make money""  - not sure where I heard this, but to some degree it's true.  I bet Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Papa Musk, etc were all laughed at for their ideas at one point and time.  Even Deep fucking value got laughed at HERE when he shared his initial thoughts on GME.  

""🐂 make money, 🌈🐻 make money (sometimes- not often) , 🐷 get slaughtered ""  

Not sure how that really relates to being risk averse or not, but I'm kinda retarded (hence being here) 

That said, it's a lot going to a casino, except that your chances can vary a bit more since you have more control over your own destiny.  The safe advice is to predetermine how much money you're willing to lose, and use that for any risky investments and nothing more.   

This is Wallstreetbets though, so you should probably just take your life savings,  take out a payday loan using your car as collateral, cash advance on your credit card, convince your parents to borrow from their retirement (lol boomers) and dump all of that into close expiring calls on something like ICLN or whatever other meme stock is near the top here.

2021-05-08 18:09:29,wallstreetbets,"As you make gains, you'll tend to become less risk adverse, as the gains beyond your initial investment are easy to see as house money, or not as valuable.  Then you start making riskier plays, which sometimes lead to high returns...which are addictive.  At that point, even if you are down and its no longer house money, your risk tolerance has been reduced.  It is a very slippery slope many people go down.

&#x200B;

If you want a safer way to increase risk tolerance, the method I would suggest to friends if they asked, would be to start with either riskier company stocks (I don't mean penny stocks), or with LEAPS on not risky companies (a LEAP refers to an option with an expiration greater than a year).  LEAPS are a favorite tool by even safer investors (buffet uses them).

Another caveat to this, is that I would strongly advise setting a hard limit on what you can ""speculate"" with.  Having a separate account for that money helps tremendously."
2021-05-08 18:14:14,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, the whole purpose of WSB is to make risky plays cause big $$$ if it pops off. You have to have the mindset where you have to be willing to lose it all on a play. There are times for ""safe"" investing like a majority of your portfolio if you want long term stability and stuff like play money to go to WSB picks"

Saved everything I could and put it in index funds, took the 25% loss and held through covid after that amazing run to not be much better off at all.

Then I yolod £29,000 into gme and made like £68300 profit, taking my savings to £100k. Working a corporate job where they don't give you any actual work, and it never looks like you're gonna be able to buy a house makes you do some funny things.

Clov is also in genomics and how they can use that to provide care. The software uses it to come up with evidence based recommendations. That is massive.

2021-05-08 19:52:00,wallstreetbets,Great post. My 2 cents. Edit 2 imo is the most likely outcome. I think you're overlooking their demographic. They are selling to people 60 and over. The older you get the less you change. That's the reason this industry is so hard to disrupt. My parents are in their 60's and 70's and still don't know how to use the tv remote or their stereo which they've had for 15 plus years and my mother will routinely be on the phone for hours trying to figure out her phone/tv contracts. Yes everyone wants to save money but good luck trying to convince old people to make the switch. Clov will only succeed if they can somehow market the shit out of their product and make the switch for people completely seamless. Old people want to live hassle free and although this may save them some money it's still a hassle.

2021-05-08 14:16:29,wallstreetbets,"Warrants give you the option to buy one share of the stock at set-price (usually $11.5 with spacs) before expiration which is usually 3-5 years into the future. Different from options as in 1 warrant = 1 share, can be exercised at expiration to buy a share at pre-fixed price. Options are contracts worth 100 shares each and usually don't go >2-3 years out. 

Before expiration, however, you trade warrants exactly like shares, but they are slightly less liquid i.e. larger spreads in bid/ask. If this is a long term hold, warrants gives a much better ROI - you pay less and get higher returns. It's what the professionals buy for longer term holds."

2021-05-08 17:39:22,wallstreetbets,"Big institutions hold tons of heavily shorted companies. In some cases they make it easier to short because companies like blackrock and vanguard are more than willing to lend out shares. See Gamestop. Blackrock likely made a killing lending to shorters at every stage during the last year. And remember. the only shorters who actually got fucked by that were the ones in at 1-5$. 

They also have projections 5+ years out. A timeframe most of WAB won’t wait. 

I hope you guys at least take this into account before people start yoloing weeklies on this play."

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Three upcoming macro events that aren't really priced in yet None of the three events I'm talking about need anything to happen to occur, they're all just going to happen unless action is taken to stop them.  Two are extremely bearish, one is very bullish.  I don't really know how they're going to play out in the markets, but I figured I'd bring some attention to t them so all of you could keep them in mind when betting.  Here they are in chronological order:

1. The end of the Eviction/Foreclosure Moratorium.  This one is hugely bearish, and could potentially crash the housing market, or at least cool it off.  Since the pandemic started, there's been various Federal and State bans on foreclosures and evictions.  In a normal year around 3 million Americans get evicted/foreclosed on.  This all expires on June 30.  Or SOONER, because last week a judge ruled against the program and the Biden admin is emergency appealing it.  It's been well over a year with this going on now, so it could lead to as many as 4 million homes/apartments getting dumped on the market in a very short time period.
2. The start of the kid based Stimulus payments.  This one, like all stimmy programs, is super bullish.  In July the checks start going out, $250 to $300 per kid, per month, paying until at least December.  That's a lot of money going into families' hands, and it will get spent, because kids are basically just roving germ factories that devour money.  I don't really see this program talked about anywhere, and even a lot of people with kids I know are unaware of it.  Surprise free money gets spent even faster than expected free money.
3. The end of student loan forbearance in September.  This one is unbelievably bearish.  Basically, everyone in prime spending ages is going to get hit with hundreds to thousands of dollars a month in bills that they haven't had to pay for a year plus at this point.  It's effectively a huge tax hike on the working class and working professionals, and is going to have some pretty negative implications for spending, because that's tens of millions of people who largely don't have extra money all of a sudden sending hundreds or thousands of $$ a month to the feds instead of spending it on Artisanal Gourd Toast or Pumpkin Spice iPhones.

So basically this summer/early fall we've got a big spike coming in homes on the market, a large, mostly ignored round of stimulus hitting people with kids, followed by a huge cliff in consumers disposable income.

So, I dunno, bet against the housing market in June/July/August, on Disney in July-December, and against anything people under 40 buy after September?

Curious what everyone else thinks about these things coming up.  And obviously the feds could pass bills changing any of these, but I think congress at this point is more likely to nothing than something unless/until their own portfolios get affected."
2021-05-08 15:07:37,wallstreetbets,"I think these aren't priced in because everyone thinks these policies are going to get extended.

At this point everyone in the federal government knows the covid relief measures (low interest rates, forbearance etc)  have propped up the economy but nobody wants to be the bad guy and end all of the stimulus."

2021-05-08 12:40:19,wallstreetbets,"Fuck Trulieve, lol.

Probably a safe place to put your money into but fuck them as a company.

For those asking why, Trulieve is the largest MMTC in Florida, with something like 70-80 stores, 20-30 more than most of their competitors. They are widely seen as the ""WalMart"" of weed, which is both good and bad.

For patients, their products are nightmares with little to no quality control. If you check the r/Flmedicaltrees subreddit, you can see an abundance of grievances due to issues with their concentrates having hairs, fibers, and other inorganic, non-cannabis materials in them. Their actual weed is extraordinarily hit or miss, despite their advertising ""Cultivar collections"" at $58/eighth (where out west the literal equivalent quality is more like $25/eighth). Literally the only saving grace for Trulieve is that they have an open return policy.

Yes, let me repeat that, Trulieve's success rides on the fact that you can return their shitty weed.

If you go on the subreddit, you can see that they, despite being wildly successful, just couldn't pay they're employees this Friday and had workers (making $11/hour) walk out. 

Additionally, remember that whole Matt Gaetz is a Pedo thing? Turns out he has a lot of ties to people who have a lot of ties to people who run Trulieve. So there's a lot of questionable, shady shit going on in the upper-echelon. And when lawmakers have such close ties it makes you wonder how much more went into Trulieve being the first MMTC to sell flower (Florida law only allowed for vape cups originally), then announce and sell edibles. As an aside, they also get their new products approved far quicker than most others. They just released live rosin a few months back without much of a hitch to it, but other dispensaries had their releases of shatter (which was new to that dispensary) be delayed by regulations and testing and everything (see: Liberty, columbia care, and harvest, who's first releases of shatter, and budder for harvest, were ill received due to seeming impurities, but was just really old shit from going through the approvals.)"

And I can even accept that it isn't going to be the most potent batch of weed and lack the whole ""bag appeal"" thing. I can write all of that off easily enough. You get what you pay for and all of that...

But when you really do go out of your way to buy the top shelf at $58 and some $40 eighth of what some other dispensary considers Tier 2 blows it out of the water... It's shitty weed lol.

Also when their last batch of grape cake has more fully developed seeds than I've gotten in the entire medical program, and their current Cultivar releases smoke like garbage... It's garbage."

Now, the premiums aren't that great (relatively speaking) and the moonshot seems closer than ever.

The low IV right now is not worth losing out on the massive gains.  
Counter-intuitive right? Usually, one would sell CC when IV is low.

Right now I'm just going to hold and be happy with any missed premiums going forward.  
I do plan on selling CSP whenever I have the cash available."

I'd suggest calling a tax professional ASAP so they can tell you the same thing I just did so that the IRS doesn't rape you with an audit.

2021-05-08 19:55:21,wallstreetbets,Just because the valuation is so friggin high.
2021-05-08 12:35:38,wallstreetbets,I was optimistic but u less there is huge buying power the shorts might win here. They seem to be in deep. People are hoping for a stock buyback but I don’t think the ceo can because the float needs to be =>10%?? I think for Russell
2021-05-08 07:17:24,wallstreetbets,I'm still trying to figure out what my play for PLTR should be this week. I really like the company but everything acts so stupid around earnings.
2021-05-08 17:00:01,wallstreetbets,"> WKHS

Not particularly.

This stock's volatility depends on the retail trader that bought that stock amidst the hype. From my experience, the stock price won't change much regardless of the earnings.

Every other week from this point on you will get a generic DD telling how they are going to revolutionize electric truck, drone, delivery, or whatever the fuck. But remember this, when you see the word ""short"" on those DDs, you should know those DDs are written by chums who 25-30 are now bag holding horse dump.

> PLTR

I advised my family trust (lol, I advised my brother who can't buy a house right now but has some disposable income), that no matter what PLTR will never ever dip below $22. He dumped an undisclosed amount in that stock and he isn't replying to my Facebook messages. I hope he didn't buy calls."

2021-05-08 10:03:15,wallstreetbets,Came here to say this... definitely my portfolio’s most anticipated earnings of the week!
2021-05-08 14:46:14,wallstreetbets,I have 3000 May 21 $14 calls at .60. This sucker better live up to it’s expectations.
2021-05-08 18:44:40,wallstreetbets,I don’t know but every time I try to add PSFE to one my watch lists in RH it gets removed. I even made a “list” with just PSFE on it and it got removed a short time later. Not sure if that’s on purpose or not — Hanlon’s Razor probably applies — but it’s just something odd that I noticed. If it’s doing that for everybody on RH then that might explain some of the under the radar stuff.
2021-05-08 12:19:20,wallstreetbets,Don't forget UWMC hitting a new all-time low

2021-05-08 09:38:23,wallstreetbets,Depends on the sector the company is in. I wouldn't be bearish on consumer companies like COTY for example.

2021-05-08 17:25:18,wallstreetbets,Name of the movie? It will be impossible to adapt the greatness of monster into a movie. A tv show should be the best option and it's easy to not mess up since the anime is like a novel.
2021-05-08 12:15:06,wallstreetbets,"Unironically, I loved everything about the show — even Mr. Heckle. Definitely a slow burn near the start, but the payoff later on with some of the quotes like this one are really satisfying."

2021-05-08 17:34:10,wallstreetbets,The Fugitive for both the tv show movie. They were both made before the anime was probably conceived. I just don’t know if the monster creator base the manga off of that show. Monster is a top 10 anime for me.

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Ex Market Maker Ape calls it Business, not necessarily Manipulation &#x200B;

[JJ Gorilla keeps it real](https://preview.redd.it/50ykgvtqwux61.png?width=2192&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f8a339da6c0b18d27b94905d38d59a6d4451a2e)

I just listened to [two podcasts](https://youtu.be/chE2OEToxOg) where the ex-market maker JJ Gorilla u/vwaptrader1 tells it from the other side.

  
As retail traders, we have to admit that we chase price, but we should learn from our mistakes as quickly as possible. One way to do that is to learn the mechanics and business of doing a deal.

In episode 187, JJ goes on to say why he feels the $GME action wasn't all business and more needs to be considered to what is going on from those who hold the stock and how impressed he was with r/wallstreetbets. From what I took from the convo, in essence, he has a gut feeling that someone is using the hype to get out of GME and he's looking to the management.

What was even more interesting to me was the way he talks about Supply and the order of events in which the Business gets done.  As he explained that Supply is the key to everything and how a market maker's job is to facilitate those that need to sell their supply of stock/securities/assets etc. and to provide liquidity to those traders looking to buy up to that Supply.

&#x200B;

The Gap and Trap move he describes in the podcast played out to the letter yesterday in the Nasdaq, so I have no reason not to look more into what this ex-market maker has to say.  Throughout the podcast, there is  talk of manipulation, but of retail trader's actions and emotions. But if we understand their game, we don't necessarily have to succumb to the pitfalls."
2021-05-08 11:30:48,wallstreetbets,"I don't think that fits.
Gamestop also stated in their earning reports that their share overahorted.
And that the unwinding of share would mean they need shares to unwind. And to do so need to buy. Can't buy what is not available. And if buying occurs price would have skyrocketed to cover their shorts.

Apes been buying... Assuming that even the holdernof 480+ would continue to buy u liquidity.

If we go backward to a post from a Korean of how much Korea spent in buying power for April, there are about 750mil ...as of May that is on the market. About 10x the outstanding shares.

Also I'd pulled from 🐳 wisdom site on ownership and gme already was owned by institute and insider alone."

2021-05-08 11:00:17,wallstreetbets,"All honesty, this is some seriously wrinkle-brained stuff."
2021-05-08 11:40:00,wallstreetbets,"JJ seemed to think it just wasn't trading right, he had no actual proof, just gut feeling. This interview was also a few months back now, so GME less relevant, but the overall appraisal of r/wallstreetbets 's ability to shake things up, was a positive for the whole industry which has obviously been out to get the retail trader as much as possible as we're the Demand they need to fill the Supply.  

For me it's more about the mechanics of what needs to be done.  
1. Get some early investors  
2. Build Hype - Create demand  
3. When it goes 🔥that is when the initial Supply is sold and Outside paper becomes Inside paper.  
4. Market Makers trade inside Supply - pulling and pushing retail traders around.  


If i am not in between 1 and 2, and 3 has occurred, that means I just need to watch out for the Gap and Trap type trades in 4 and not chase price"

There are nscc 801. 002 pushed back 45 days.. and then all of a sudden 006 came out. 

The fact of the #5 is my question. It's a forward trend .. a dumped... Where do you get share to dump? .. check the short volume and interest on those days vs total volume.. 
Take a look at yesterday.. short volume % is about 60% of total volume.

That not something that should happen on regular stocks.


I don't believe the MM unwind their short positions and with the sentiments of Reddit being diamond hands causing issues with their short position not being able to cover.. cornered as they keep shorting to drive the price down in hope of paperhand, or delay in hope apes just get tired.. but apes continue to buy and volume starts to dry up.

2021-05-08 12:31:01,wallstreetbets,"I am not disagreeing with you, and may be GME or MEME stocks is on the edge of the normal business of regular stock trading. 

The take away for me was that, when something trades oddly, or there is a lot of hype, I'll step back and see if I can recognise a trading pattern aka agenda, and attempt to not chase price and  be the last in to get long.  The only way to recognise an odd market behaviour is to trade a similar portfolio of stocks and not always chase what is currently 🔥🔥🔥"
2021-05-08 14:41:57,wallstreetbets,">Take a look at yesterday.. short volume % is about 60% of total volume.

I did take a look. It's [21%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme), not 60%. Roughly that same amount that [HYLN](https://fintel.io/ss/us/hyln) is shorted each day.

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Blackrock Buys 2 MILLION SHARES OF CLOV 

According to FINTEL, Blackrock recently bought 2,078,899 shares. 

https://fintel.io/so/us/clov

Scroll down to the 13 F filings.

I will first say that I am NEW to trading so take my opinion cautiously and do your own DD. I am NEW compared to the 100 year old WSB OGs. This is my disclaimer.

I am not confident enough to write DD but Im working on it. One thing I do know is whenever I follow Blackrocks moves, I make green sometimes sooner sometimes later. Blackrock is SMART MONEY, so I am drawn to their moves for validation. Blackrock usually plays a long game to sell when they are comfortable with the profit margin; this is not exactly breaking news. I was first hesitant with CLOV because of the legal investigation but that appears to be losing muster.

I have $10 Calls and $11 Calls for 06/18 and will start adding shares on Monday . I am looking at Jan 2022 CALLS to give me longer term perspective on this stock.

The SI % of float has reached 43.48%

As always, feel free to hammer my opinion as I am all ears. Maybe you are smarter than Blackrock ? This is not DD and I am no where near a financial advisor."
2021-05-08 10:34:57,wallstreetbets,Thought this said Blackcock
2021-05-08 03:42:59,wallstreetbets,"You have no idea how CLOV fits into any Blackrock portfolios. There are any number of reasons their models could tell them to add this to some other mix of assets and doesn't mean that it's a good individual stock for a retail trader. Blackrock also owns shares of damn near everything, so their stake in something doesn't tell you a whole lot."
2021-05-08 10:30:55,wallstreetbets,"With a high short interest this means the hedge fund crooks will manipulate money out of our pockets, again, right?  Chelsie Clinton is on the CLOV board, President Biden just may bestow some favoritism here with the medicare age being lowered."
2021-05-08 10:58:47,wallstreetbets,Clov to da moon 🚀🌚
2021-05-08 06:09:05,wallstreetbets,they buy CLOV to sell covered calls to retards
2021-05-08 07:39:04,wallstreetbets,Ok ok so Blackrock buying CLOV means nothing. Got it
2021-05-08 09:23:05,wallstreetbets,"If you like Blackrock, you can just buy Blackrock. You’re not exactly cracking the code here."
2021-05-08 10:30:29,wallstreetbets,"Blackrock owns Tenet and other significant healthcare interest. This simply gives them a peek under the kimono for their bigger more important positions. Long term, the thing that people do not fully understand is that the shit that the BUCAs do to make their MA plans as profitable as they are, are literally criminal. Not a figure of speech. It’s also dependent on market share. So if you think CLOV or anyone else with an interest in hopping into the MA pool is going to be allowed in there successfully, you’re wrong."
2021-05-08 03:02:59,wallstreetbets,CLOV can suck my ass
2021-05-08 03:43:30,wallstreetbets,Such a minute amount for balckrock this likely represents nothing more than exposure across many sectors.

2021-05-08 03:48:27,wallstreetbets,BlackRock holding 20 million dollars of something is the same proportion as the average American owning 4 toothpicks. It means nothing at all.
2021-05-08 04:54:36,wallstreetbets,I think that CLOV will tank very soon

2021-05-08 11:51:44,wallstreetbets,"True, they’re huge so they buy almost everything. However, Baillie Gifford also added substantially and they’re real active investors who do pick carefully."
2021-05-08 03:49:32,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. I guess my rationale is that they started using the same approach to GME when everyone and their grandmother was mocking and laughing at DFV. They bought GME shares in blocks periodically.

$17.5 million is obviously not much for Blackrock but no one throws money into a gaping hole you know lol"
2021-05-08 07:09:41,wallstreetbets,They also might purchase this not as a securities investment but as a hedge against a put strategy 🙂 We can all have fun while investing but it’s more fun to have all the information .
2021-05-08 07:02:56,wallstreetbets,I head they did it to hedge their Equinox short.

2021-05-08 08:52:43,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-05-08 11:55:04,wallstreetbets,"Nah, there are smaller MA companies that do well by actually keeping their patients healthier which is Clover’s strategy. Any of the shady tactics may work well up front but long term they don’t work well. The regular insurers will do that crap because they can’t really optimize for MA since those optimizations would actually screw up their regular healthcare business by constraining revenue growth.

Clover is being shorted like crazy now but it’s a legitimate long term bet. It may also be a reasonable short term squeeze bet if you think their earnings report will hugely best expectations."
2021-05-08 10:37:17,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your response. This is exactly what I want, an opinion different from my own with clear reasons.

The other posts here don't tell me much except their opinion that Blackrock throws pocket money into gaping holes (I guess they did the same with GME and AMC). 

In my very simple and basic opinion, I think Blackrock is just following the mob at this point. It has paid off for them so far"

2021-05-08 06:13:03,wallstreetbets,its been tanking. this last friday all the growth stocks got juiced across the board when jobs report sucked and wallstreet realized that QE and cheap money weren't going away anytime soon. gave them more balls to invest in shitty spacs and engineless evs and hydrogen bomb companies

2021-05-08 04:17:00,wallstreetbets,"I agree that they're unlikely to buy shares of things they expect to tank, so you have at least that seal of approval. But you have to understand that institutions and funds will have lots of separate portfolios with their own individual directives and mandates, and sometimes they buy things because they're the only thing that fits the rules. It's really just not a piece of information that you draw any conclusions from."
2021-05-08 05:40:38,wallstreetbets,New SEC rule. They have to tighten up on margin across the board.
2021-05-08 14:01:25,wallstreetbets,"Blackrock buys everything, it's what they do through their funds. You shouldn't draw too many conclusions from that. If you pick any random company right now and go look at their 13F you're likely to see them as major shareholder."
2021-05-08 07:31:46,wallstreetbets,"Well it is still relevant information combined with CLOV growing SI. Sure it is not the whole picture and I said this is not DD, its news"
2021-05-08 04:30:09,wallstreetbets,"Huh? That's not really a reply to what I've said. You did the same with the guy above who articulates my point much better.

I think clover will go up in the mid/long term with the MA age and expansion plan, but it's got a long hangover effect of spacmania and the seek insurance thing is a valid concern. I also think that since gme everything has become a ""omg short interest"" fiasco with people buying stocks expecting a repeat. It ain't going to happen every again, risk adjustment across the board already occurred (look at the jump in clov to 17).



So in summary, it is about making bets, but not about parroting useless shite like you have done. Buy shares if you think it'll go up, average down it it tanks post earnings. Don't expect a squeeze, gamma slides occur but less frequently than people would have you believe"
2021-05-08 07:08:46,wallstreetbets,Is it not implied in my OP that Im NEW to trading. How long have you been posting?
2021-05-08 04:21:30,wallstreetbets,Agreed but this is called WallStreetBETS not r INvesting or stocks.
2021-05-08 17:06:01,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this. 

I got the same advice in WSB years ago when ARKK was buying shit stocks. People thought coattailling Kathy is the best way to go. Then ARKK dumped those stocks in the weeks after when those stocks were at ATL."
2021-05-08 07:46:24,wallstreetbets,Ok so in short what you are saying is Blackrock buying CLOV shares means shite. Thanks for your opinion.

2021-05-08 07:05:10,wallstreetbets,"I really don't know how this is useless; reporting how a major institution has dropped $20 million on a company's shares is newsworthy. 

I mean call it pocket change but they aren't throwing that at my little cousins lemonade stand! !!!

 I look at this simply through one lense of FOLLOW THE SMART MONEY. Btw they did not throw 100s of millions at Gamestop, but they made a handsome profit on their ""pocket change"" investment <<<< smart money"

2021-05-08 06:55:59,wallstreetbets,^^You got a PUT spread! Thats fair so your opinion is as biased as perhaps mine.
2021-05-08 18:39:06,wallstreetbets,Yes but for black rock its a like if u had a $100 bucks n u threw $.01 or one cent into a stock.
2021-05-08 07:20:24,wallstreetbets,Many OGs also bashed GME way back so being an OG is not a measure of credibility in any sense

2021-05-08 07:32:14,wallstreetbets,"Lol. No just educated.

WTF. Perhaps you should hang in r/Investing and learn a thing or two before trying to have a debate with people who really understand the markets.

The majority of posters already told you a couple of million bet on CLOV by a huge company like Blackrock doesn't mean anything. It's less than a rounding error.

Do you even realize that one part of a massive investment company can be shorting the stock at the same time another part of the company is long the same stock?

I honestly look forward to your DD so you can prove me wrong."
2021-05-08 07:16:11,wallstreetbets,"Let me guess. You came to WSB because of GameStop.

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"In the Money (or slightly at the money) Put option holding over weekend. 

I just wanted to share my thought on this trade here and get advice. I have been trading options on the SPY for about a month and a half now and have profited a good deal from it. I bought 4 contracts of the 422 put expiry 05/14 at 2.75 a contract. Market closed at 422.12 and currently after market at the time of this post 422.35. My thinking is that it is overbought on the RSI on the 4 hour chart, it is starting a downward momentum on the MACD (or at least has plateau'd at 0.5) and has created a ceiling at 422.80 of which it has bounced off it 2x today. Plus its rally from Thursday, my thinking is that it is going to consolidate and correct itself and possibly be decently profitable on Monday. Is it wise to hold onto contracts over the weekend like this? Does my thinking work and make sense? If over the weekend it is just stagnant, the theta is -.18 for my contract, will it affect it a whole bunch?"

2021-05-08 00:59:03,wallstreetbets,I think it’s alright. Market makers usually mark down option prices on Friday as they don’t want to pay time decay.  So some of price loss from theta already priced in.

2021-05-08 16:35:59,wallstreetbets,Black rock is a hedge fund n they bought a lot more XL on Friday shorts keep borrowing on a margin account and shorting. Same way they did blnk set up a bear trap this has been the same way. False short report than hedge funds short than shorts come and attack. Than tutes cover which they did 3 weeks ago look at that volume. Than it’s a bear trap from there. Same thing happened to blnk so they key is buy low and keep adding don’t blow ur cash all at one time. Look at shares borrowed on iborrowdesk and look at tutes buying on fintel. The name of the game is buy low be patient than sell high.

But some organizations use this child to make money and take him to various commercial activities. Now he has returned to his hometown to go to school. If someone go to talk with him,he will ask you to give money to him although he even doesn't know how much the money is.

They call it ""television programming"" for for a reason. He looks disgusted by his government as well.. I live blocks away from the 3rd precinct that was started on fire, in Minneapolis. NOT burnt to the ground. Structure is fine. ACE, Wendys, Maxxit Pawn, Minnehaha falls liquor.. Worked ate Maxx it for Five years. Crazy days we're still in.  I feel the precinct going up in flames needed to happen along with the marches.. and fire works. Nothing has changed for years.. To many HUMAN BEING's have been killed by untrained officers.. Lawyers spend 12 years studying, knowing in their minds, they'll have life's in there hands.. Why not cops? Sentencing yet in August, then the appeal process. The small business's , burnt are a damn shame..  I wonder what this kid is thinking ...   
I love this site and am thankful for the developers. New here.. But have been reading for years.  
Cracked up while i was writing this 🤣

2021-05-08 06:07:26,wallstreetbets,It mentions that in the articles he also looks 8 still despite the fact that he is 14. Hormones are used to in America for a bunch of different things but it’s regulated so you can’t use them on kids. China doesn’t have regulation and who knows what the injections actually do in the long term or if he even knew what it was for.

Its such a large diverse company you may have a poor experience with a small part. But in terms of diversification I doubt it matters. If China is willing to attack them on terms of a monopoly I know their sales arnt all bs.  Maybe I'm wrong but overall this company is worth way more then its current pricing.

I am long baba and this isn't financial advice"

Now that I have a 1 year old myself, every now and then I remember that Maury episode and wonder what it would be like to change my sons poopy diaper if he weighed over 100 pounds."

I don't really trust any information coming out of a Chinese company. They lie about financials and all sorts of other shit. I'm sure there is going to be some good ones but I'd suggest watching the documentary ""The China Hustle"" before investing into Chinese companies. Like I said, I'm sure some with end up being good companies, but I'm not putting my money into any of them until there's more transparency."

It’s odd how Covid came from a small area in China but it didn’t greatly spread in China! The Chinese government put people with Covid on planes, from that small area to come to NY, Florida, Washington DC, California,  Texas,  and other places in America to infect the people who have been through the struggles & losses, of World War 2, the depression,  Vietnam, loss of World Trade citizens & building, resulting Terrorist losses, also building America, to the superpower it was before the last problems!

2021-05-08 13:30:22,wallstreetbets,"Actually, Jack ma did offer to pay for the kids tuition for college. But the kid's parents turned it down cuz the parents didn't see the point of receiving an education when the kid was earning so much. The kids parents were pretty uneducated themselves too and just couldn't understand the meaning of investing for the future. But I also wouldn't blame them too much because they were struggling to put food on the table as both of them had disabilities and it was the kids earnings that finally relieved them of having to be constantly struggling for the next meal.  Do some research first before u go around getting all hate and jealousy on the rich."

Everyone wanted boys to continue their family line and it's estimated that there were anywhere from 7 to 20 extra boys born per 100 girls (that is, 107-120 boys for every 100 girls). China eventually realized how stupid that was and reverted the policy, now making it a two child policy instead of just one."

Any government attempting to interfere in the sovereignty of another major country would be severely dealt with by other nations, even if it were done for the ""right reasons "".

2021-05-08 00:36:37,wallstreetbets,"Not a financial advisor but my plan for next week is to liquidate my $RBLX calls that I bought 2 weeks ago. I we'll also be selling calls on the day of earnings because usually the unexpected news (earnings) become expected and implied volatility, which LITERALLY translates to ""the expected movement of the underlying stock""  goes down. So does the premium that the call was bought for. On and then on Tuesday to Thursday I'll be chilling. After that, on Friday I will be selling my calls on $BABA and I will be collecting $20k in premium for the puts I sold and I also expect to collect another $14k on premium for the calls I will be selling on the day of earnings. And for the calls that I buy on Alibaba I expect a $62k, all in all I expect a little less than a $100k for the upcoming week."
2021-05-08 01:27:28,wallstreetbets,"No i mean your screenshot doesn't show your actual position. Just what stock you were playing and the P/L. What was your entry point and exit point on PLTR if this isn't total BS? What strike? When did you buy and sell?

Either your charts are listing P/L DAY for a day trade you made last week and exited - and it is misleading because it says DAY like this was today's profit - or everything is faked."
2021-05-08 02:51:03,wallstreetbets,"Good for you for playing earning season instead of running from it, like I do.   So you make a prediction on which way the stock will go at earnings and you play it long with calls or puts?  Would you care to share your stock price earnings behavior model?  The reason I ask is that I have attempted to predict price behavior and couldn't get anywhere past random so I gave up.

Thanks in advance"

2021-05-08 01:44:48,wallstreetbets,Shit man. Everything u see is real. I ain't got no reason to lie to a bunch of people on Reddit.
2021-05-08 03:11:24,wallstreetbets,"Sure. So I have this strategy that helps me how the market will react to a earnings beat, that strategy is 83% effective. After I've chosen my stock, I buy a call expiring in the same week as the earnings because if I buy a call that expires a a couple of months from the earnings the profits will not be as huge as the short calls. After doing that I sella put on the option and collect that premium to offset my risks. I make sure that I collect a larger premiums than the call option I bought. Since I'm very certain that implied volatility will dramatically decrease after the earnings, usually I collect the full premium. After collecting the premium, I use that money to sell calls and they become worthless because theta eats it up like a muthafucka, delta and Vega will also be on my side when I sell the call on the day of the earnings. So for example, with $BABA since I'm very bullish on it I bought the 230 Call that expires on Friday (one day after earnings). It's relatively at the money and if there is a movement to the upwards I will benefit. I also sold 100 contracts of the 220 put and I collected a premium of $29k. With and on the day of the earnings I will be selling a call that's 5 out the money. I'm expecting a premium of $41k off that. And that's how I approach every single earnings report. I'm sorry for writing a long ass paragraph lol 🤣."

2021-05-08 16:41:46,wallstreetbets,Hold. It’ll go to $35 a share soon
2021-05-08 16:52:43,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry in 2 years it’ll be 33 again and you’ll make ur money back
2021-05-08 17:00:49,wallstreetbets,Just hold you fu&@$ bitch -39 is recoverable and even tho outlook is bleak you don’t lose til you sell. So just don’t sell even if it takes a few years this could easily grow more than %40. No one knows the future bro hang tight. Buying the bottom even in very small amounts is a great way to get your average cost down
2021-05-08 01:31:47,wallstreetbets,Fk dude at leat your wife's 401k could have acted as a hedge being in normal funds.  To many of you have a gambling addiction.  It doesn't matter if a stock makes you bank in the end alot of you are going to fk it all up.
2021-05-07 23:28:38,wallstreetbets,FUCK PLTR. I refuse to ever touch that thing again.

Seems this moron is super desperate for attention in their life."
2021-05-08 12:11:08,wallstreetbets,This Reddit causes more harm than good to the retail investors. I’m out of it for good! Do yourself a favor people and don’t follow it as they use you to make their gains but will never direct you properly. You need to be experienced for you to not get burned!

2021-05-08 12:38:28,wallstreetbets,"Guys, Post like these are fake. Members of the SEC and Wallstreet are creating post like these with the intent to highlight them in upcoming hearings in attempt to block your freedom to earn money the way they do. “We must protect them from themselves” is always their argument That being said, please realize this is a public forum and not everyone here is on your side. The wealthy HATE the idea of ordinary folks getting a chance to play on their golf course so to speak"
2021-05-08 12:48:21,wallstreetbets,Why waste your time posting fake pictures for Karma? Real life too much for you?

How could you live with yourself after something like that, I mean I’ve never even seen that kind of money before in my life or anywhere near it. Hopefully you’ll make it back to near where you started though, I mean you made all of that once before so it’s gotta be possible to do it again? Good luck man. Sorry"
2021-05-08 16:29:47,wallstreetbets,It’s sad to see people recklessly investing money they didn’t work hard for. You should be ashamed to post such stupidity. This should be investing not a cult u idiot.
2021-05-07 22:23:48,wallstreetbets,God damn. I hope you are only 18 years old. You might break even before retirement
2021-05-07 21:43:44,wallstreetbets,Be nice to your wife's boyfriend. You'll be sleeping on his couch.
2021-05-07 21:53:16,wallstreetbets,A few years ago Tesla was weeks away from insolvency. They were still losing money and the ev market wasn’t great. After their first profitable quarter. The stock exploded. It took them 10 years of being public to get to profitability

2021-05-08 01:23:36,wallstreetbets,"I actually used to work at a foundry that desperately needed Palantir type technology 15 years ago. The final parts would leave the door with more rework metal than original casting, as they had been for years. Parts would go through the very expensive rework process so times before being scrapped and recast. They probably still do today to be honest.

Oh wow. That company was Warren Buffet's ""$10B mistake"".

“I was wrong ... in judging the average amount of future earnings and, consequently, wrong in my calculation of the proper price to pay for the business...  far from my first error of that sort. But it’s a big one""

How relevant."

2021-05-07 22:18:06,wallstreetbets,I very rarely actually laugh out loud. I did reading this.
2021-05-08 00:35:57,wallstreetbets,That’s a Texas size 10-4.
2021-05-07 22:28:24,wallstreetbets,Funny. Damn funny.
2021-05-07 23:10:20,wallstreetbets,Had to hurriedly say 'nothing' when mine just asked me what I was laughing out.
2021-05-08 05:48:42,wallstreetbets,that made me laugh harder than any other comment in a while

2021-05-08 10:26:42,wallstreetbets,"probably over 30 and has been saving for 10 years, the larger accounts you see aren't held by people fresh out of college"
2021-05-08 03:33:40,wallstreetbets,"200,000 k in savings isn’t that obscene. Like sure it’s a sizable amount but someone earning 100k and putting in 10% in the 401k could do this pretty easy."
2021-05-08 08:33:33,wallstreetbets,My clients gave it to me. I save $75k-100k per year from my business.
2021-05-08 10:36:46,wallstreetbets,He literally said it was an inherited 401k

2021-05-07 23:32:16,wallstreetbets,Palantir - don't disrespect Daddy Karp like that...
2021-05-07 21:46:07,wallstreetbets,"This is such a retarded noob way of thinking.
Imagine spending all thiis money to have a loser stock for 5+ years that could +7-10% every year on some easy boomer investment. Even more of a return is possible if you know how to take losses and understand risk management and move on.
Why don’t I make money on smart stuff and then invest in this once I see actual support instead of having everything tied up in dogshit praying it goes up."
2021-05-08 15:15:11,wallstreetbets,For sure. This will be in the 90s in 2-4 years. The technology and data these guys are working on is insane. You're an idiot BUT hold. For sure.
2021-05-08 02:49:12,wallstreetbets,Always bet on surveillance  and data analysis technologies.

2021-05-08 11:13:09,wallstreetbets,"At that amount of money you didn’t invest. Lol if you are throwing $7k in you should yolo it to be honest. But if you are this guy a bit of diversification would be nice. 

With only $7k that stock investing plan might get you a nice 2013 Honda Accord though."
2021-05-08 00:18:17,wallstreetbets,"Actually a legit point. 

I hear of divorces where the guy has to provide the spouse a $20,000 vehicle in the divorce, so he goes and buys the absolute worst high maintenance vehicle that costs $20,000."
2021-05-08 16:44:39,wallstreetbets,He’s up there that’s for sure

2021-05-08 06:02:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah I always think Of donkey Kong the old video game.

2021-05-08 10:40:28,wallstreetbets,PLTR is four letters bud.
2021-05-07 21:32:38,wallstreetbets,You bought one of the dips for sure
2021-05-07 21:45:37,wallstreetbets,At an average price of like 32?!

The purpose of my reply was to reassure him that he hasn't LOST of any money, he's just holding a bag.  The upside here is that PLTR has potential... Over some arbitrary/unknown amount of time... And not likely the time frame that he was anticipating."
2021-05-07 23:16:14,wallstreetbets,This is not a 5+ year play. This was $45 a few months ago. OP has a pretty decent chance of seeing green by EOY. He obviously doesn't have much risk management but to sell now would be a mistake

Dude, go read a book and learn something real. God damn..."
2021-05-08 10:36:44,wallstreetbets,"That makes no sense...

Why would someone going through a divorce get to select and purchase the car their ex-spouse gets to drive post divorce? I'm calling BS. The new divorcee would get to pick a car they want and would receive the money to buy it."
2021-05-07 23:14:34,wallstreetbets,Done.

2021-05-08 10:12:35,wallstreetbets,Don’t you need like 5 positive quarters in a row for that
2021-05-08 12:20:49,wallstreetbets,Literally impossible due to structure. PLTR holders are close to being as delusional and ill informed as GME holders.
2021-05-08 01:40:21,wallstreetbets,"Ain’t gonna happen bud. Their shitty share structure makes it impossible, look up the S&P requirements for that. But they’ll be good anyway."

2021-05-08 10:45:24,wallstreetbets,"What?

Or.... the woman simply isn't as knowledgeable about what vehicles to buy vs not sort of situation, so accepts the spouse buying something they don't fully understand. 

I sort of did the same thing with all our electronics... I bought her equivalent items on paper (55"" tv vs 55"" tv) but the ones I kept had superior feature sets that she was oblivious to."

In todays society where a fictitious image, drama fueled existence, absence of intelligence, lack of character, zero conviction, a rediculously skewed moral compass, where common sense is a foreign concept, a completely non existant critical thinking ability and extreme ethical retardation are acceptable compromises as long as the surface is good looking and percieved popular among like minded airheads in the moment then you'll have the opposite of what the sanctity of marriage stood for the entirety of recorded history.

Even stipends have to be accounted for on tax forms, if he isnt doing that she can get him audited and that money claimed on his tax returns. When that money is considered gained money in any way shape or form for that year then it added as income. All the child support he should have been paying from the beginning now gets awarded as arrears, meaning he is late paying child support, on top of increased monthly payments for the remainder. After this, and trust me the state fights to get that cunt her money, he is already considered late due to the arrears. If he misses 1 payment he can be arrested and held without the ability to bond out of jail unless he pays the full balance of arrears and the 1 payment he was late on. If he isn't able to then he sits in jail until the snail court gets to him. By this time he has lost his job, residence, and personal belongings. If its his first time being late he will be released with time served and expected to catch up the payments on top of the new payments. When he undoubtedly fails to pay on time again its in the courts discretion to hold him for up to 6 months just to release him with the same expectations.

I'm glad it's being slowly torn apart. However, I STRONGLY feel that the rest of your statement is accurate & that people need to overcome societal & macroeconomic pressures in order to develop better interpersonal relationships with each other so that they can date better & take time to get to know the character of a person BEFORE deciding to take someone on as a boyfriend or girlfriend. Then, & only then should they decide to enter into a relationship. At which point once they have - they need to be an adult about it ... Commitment is commitment. People are not replaceable & you stay & fix things, pretty much no matter what. If you find out you didn't like the person later ... That means you didn't do you're due diligence before. It's not love if you can fall out of it. It should not take you more than 2-3 relationships to figure it out. That's a sign of severe immaturity."

I'm sure that an ultimatum of either, ""agree to this binding legal document filled with idiotic expectations, selfish stipulations, and morally wrong obligatory details outlined within it or no deal on marraige"" has ruined any future the ""couple"" cultivated for

2021-05-08 16:50:27,wallstreetbets,"The idea that most marriages don't last is rooted in a misunderstanding of statistics.  That is based more on people who divorce often have multiple divorces, skewing the statistic.  Most people who get married do not get divorced.  A sensible significant other that you're considering getting married to is possibly going to have feelings about you planning for divorce, and possibly with the idea that assets gained while together don't belong to both of you.  Certainly some divorces can get ugly, but if you don't think you can really know someone, maybe don't get married."

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"(DD) Bull case on Tenneco $TEN - one of the cheapest stocks in the market **Not a financial nor investment advisor and not offering financial advice; always do your own DD before risking your capital.**

Disc: I've been an uber TEN bull since the beginning of the year and have invested a substantial amount in this stock.

&#x200B;

**Business description:**

""Tenneco's emissions-control products meet strict air-quality legislation, optimize engine performance, improve fuel economy, and acoustically tune engine sound to fit a vehicle's profile. Ride-control products enhance safety by enabling improved steering, braking, and acceleration as well as ride comfort. Champion, Fel-Pro, Moog, Monroe, and Walker are some of Tenneco's well-known aftermarket brands. In 2020, 40% of revenue came from North America, 37% from Europe, 18% from China, and 5% other regions."" (Source: Morningstar)

&#x200B;

**Key statistics:**

P/S ratio: 0.07 (Source: Yahoo Finance)

Forward P/E ratio: 2.79 (Source: Yahoo Finance)

2020 FCF yield: 24% (Source: Morningstar)

TTM FCF yield: 92% (Source: Yahoo Finance)

&#x200B;

**Bull case:**

To be clear, this is a highly leveraged, garbage company with no bright future prospects. But any investment can be good or bad depending on the price you pay, and in this case, I strongly believe TEN is a terrible company but terrific investment. In fact, the stock is so cheap, in my view, the only way I can lose money here is if the company goes bankrupt (and they may, but I just don't see it). The fact that the company generated $235mn (2020) during the year of broad shutdowns, and the current market cap is $1bn is nonsensical. In my view, the negative sentiment stems from a perceived imminent bankruptcy and reluctance to invest in any part of the ICE vehicle supply chain. I'll take the other side and bet that the company doesn't go bankrupt any time soon (if ever) and ICE vehicles are here to stay longer than the market believes. The FCF more than covers the short-term debt and the company refinanced last year. Management is focusing on deleveraging and I believe they'll continue to strengthen their balance sheet.

&#x200B;

**Current price: $12.81 (as of writing)**

**Target price: $25-$30**

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PTON’s push to become a green company Peloton Interactive (PTON) is a company that, among other products, produced treadmills that have seen attention in the news cycle recently. 

On March 18, after market close, it was reported that [PTON’s treadmill had killed a child.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/peloton-ceo-says-child-died-in-treadmill-accident-11616093799)  Let me preface this by saying that this was by any account a tragic occurrence, but let’s talk about the stocks reaction to this:

As you can see [here](https://imgur.com/a/ZsaXN7M), between March 18 and March 19, the stock went from $102.74 to $108.31, a 5.4% increase in price.  Extrapolating from this data, we can see clearly that if they left their treadmills in operation, and they ate about 20 more children, 20*5%=100%, then the stock price would double.  The reason for the rise in stock price refers back to the theory of overpopulation, the treadmills clearly were made to help counteract in an effort to become a green company, which would allow them to receive government tax credits.  All companies with a decent profit margin kill kids, like Nestle, Monsanto, or Berkshire Hathaway.

These first time millennial parents are peloton's target audience, baby eating was obviously built in as a feature, but they decided to complain about “ethics” and “human decency.”  This caused PTON to recall their treadmills, ultimately undermining their bottom line.

Although they will no longer be a green company eligible for tax benefits, more bullish news comes in light of the recall.   We need to realize that just like high unemployment numbers are bullish for the economy, a large profit loss is very bullish for a stock.  [PTON is going to lose $165 million due to this recall](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/06/business/peloton-recall-losses/index.html), which is very bullish for the stock."
2021-05-07 21:14:02,wallstreetbets,"Im confused.
Puts on children?"
2021-05-07 20:59:14,wallstreetbets,"The Peloton Treadmill may help improve your life, but it turns out that what it’s really good @ is guaranteeing that puppies lose theirs. So good in fact that many Veterinarians and pro-kill pup shelters are turning to Pelotons exclusively for all of their pup culling needs. Peloton could be poised to make a huge comeback based solely on the orders received from this previously untapped market, and I for one applaud them!"
2021-05-07 21:02:46,wallstreetbets,"Mr. Foley said the company is aware of a “small handful” of cases involving Peloton’s treadmill equipment in which children have been hurt.

Mega bullish"
2021-05-07 22:00:20,wallstreetbets,Idgi tho what happened on the Peloton treadmill could've happened on any other treadmill. What makes this a specific case?
2021-05-07 23:07:18,wallstreetbets,"They are doing it wrong, they should have figured out how to program the treadmills to eat the uppity parents instead, causing a wealth transfer to the kids in the family so they can come to reddit and blow it all on more PTON stock. Now the parents are just going to have MORE MONEY since they have less kids and they will throw it all into whatever /r/investing recommends."

2021-05-08 07:45:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, unless those are gains from a way smaller deposit or used as a FD account, it's retarded to keep so much money into RH. Contract fees are almost nothing in comparison to larger portfolios and with other brokers, you have access to way more than just stocks and options, better customer support to start."

And paying a small fortune on healthcare and rent (since they can't afford to buy a house at today's prices, and with the school loans they won't qualify for a mortgage.) Kind of hard to save $200k as a new college grad in 2021."
2021-05-08 09:15:00,wallstreetbets,"I guess saving $10,000 a year for like 20 years makes sense. But that's a lot of comfort to give up for a long time just so you can have a butt ton of money when you're 50. I'd love to see a break down of how many jobs pay what anual salary in my country."

2021-05-08 03:30:01,wallstreetbets,"I think the evidence points towards retail owning the float now. Still not a 100% confirmation but still...

- Fidelity new clients in Q1 Jan-Mar was 4.1m (2020 was like 1.5m)
- AMC has 3.2m retail clients (I think owing 80% of shares)
- numbers coming out of overseas markets like Korea

Once we hit 17/5 and institutions come up with their numbers, it’ll be very clear. BlackRock position hasn’t moved, although some changes for sure (eg Senvest probably sold their 5m shares)"

2021-05-08 05:05:42,wallstreetbets,I don’t think Reddit’s own the float. I think retail owns the float. Huge difference. Data out of Korea in March-April suggests Korean ants own like $1bn+ of GME. Come on...Korea?

But I’ve not seen any analysis done saying the Retail ownership is Low. All I see if the SI% and some number suggesting 10m short. But that number is most definitely false or outdated. Institutional + retail ownership will definitely exceed total shares plus 10m"

One last question if you'll indulge me cuz I'm a little bit of an accounting nerd -

My non glass blowing ass would assume there is a shit ton of margin in the biz (like 25%+ EBIDTA avg).  Am I correct to think it is a high margin racket?"
2021-05-07 21:57:23,wallstreetbets,"Glass business is doing really good in the current environment. Margin is generally good from where I work. it will not apply to this stock specifically, because their glasses are special, so I have no idea what their margins are.

But the manufacturing challenges still apply to them and it’s going to be so hard to scale and keep production integrity."

2021-05-08 18:20:40,wallstreetbets,"I will bag hold, but I am not buying more."
2021-05-08 01:18:43,wallstreetbets,I’m just here for the comments
2021-05-08 01:57:09,wallstreetbets,"Pathetic,
Lose all of it"
2021-05-07 20:15:18,wallstreetbets,Omg I’m being made into a bag holder for life
2021-05-08 00:56:10,wallstreetbets,"Heavy red bags, yes indeed..."
2021-05-07 20:16:16,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I want to even out my shares to 2000, reduce my avg cost. Cause I’m retarded, but now I’m a broke ape"
2021-05-07 20:17:44,wallstreetbets,you crazy ape I actually thought about it but I want to play roblox their earnings comes out on Monday? with a target range of 80 while trading around 67?
2021-05-07 21:59:36,wallstreetbets,Im in similar boat but what if it keeps going lower??
2021-05-08 18:12:40,wallstreetbets,I think you should their dividend a few weeks ago alone makes me want to hold
2021-05-08 18:15:12,wallstreetbets,"They gave me everything from the tools to the access of information. I was just retarded, took a risk and didn’t pan out. It was all me."
2021-05-08 18:20:26,wallstreetbets,I’m seeing so much of those they got big balls of steel
2021-05-08 18:16:07,wallstreetbets,Hope you hold with me or buy the dip
2021-05-08 18:18:02,wallstreetbets,I know it’s a bargain at this point but I’m broke and I’m hesitant to put more cash on the table
2021-05-08 18:19:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah... I’m getting told 1-4 months... idk
2021-05-07 20:19:07,wallstreetbets,or you could swap out for calls
2021-05-07 20:34:24,wallstreetbets,"I went to see the calendar cause I'm retarded, no, May 11 is Tuesday

And I will be millionaire if SNDL was trading between 80 and 67, but is in cents. I think the earnings report is going to be bullish because every SNDL product sold out in Fire and Flower https://fireandflower.com/sundial"
2021-05-07 22:00:18,wallstreetbets,"what else you gonna do? can always buy back the ccs which will be cheaper and then sell shares for loss.

btw, been selling ccs for about 3 rounds now. im 3 dollars underwater 1500 bux), but doesn't feel as bad cuz I've made about 500* of that in premium already. This next round will yield another 500. Maybe be completely neutral by year end.

if you win 50/50 of stock picks, but are able to come out neutral or small lossnon the losers; then you'll win in the long run. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
2021-05-08 18:30:09,wallstreetbets,"From my point of view, RKT is a must but obviously, I always say is so important to diversify your portfolio. I am not sure your case but if you want a tip, try to balance it."
2021-05-07 20:26:46,wallstreetbets,That got me broke faster the last time. I really need to do more homework on all this
2021-05-07 21:52:55,wallstreetbets,"I hope you're right - they were criticized for sitting on all their cash, but they just made a small acquisition this week, so hopefully that and an earnings beat will bump it back closer to $1.25."
2021-05-07 22:02:43,wallstreetbets,I could sell now at 18 instead of later at 16... If it drops
2021-05-08 18:32:29,wallstreetbets,How many give me a range and point me in the general direction of some to look at. please and thank you
2021-05-07 20:43:13,wallstreetbets,"don't oversize yourself if you had 20 of the june 25 18 calls for instance (what i bought today for 1.40 each) you would have similar upside exposure to what you have now but you'd be 90% cash.

just make sure you don't let them get too close to expiration. once they get down to the last few weeks you either want to cash out or roll out."
2021-05-07 22:04:26,wallstreetbets,"go for it. nobody can tell the future. youre account, your choice on when to lock in losses."
2021-05-08 18:10:33,wallstreetbets,I don’t think we should. They missed their earnings by the smallest margin. If anything we should buy the dip
2021-05-08 18:40:38,wallstreetbets,"That is a personal decision and depends on the type of investor you are. In this situation, I prefer to invest with stocks instead of derivatives (with this correction, is less risky although you can earn less money). I bought stocks thinking that at the end of summer, I will see at $25-$30"
2021-05-08 18:08:51,wallstreetbets,I had to research so much just to follow what you said so insightful
2021-05-08 19:21:38,wallstreetbets,"glad i could help. :) make sure you start out slow until you get the hang of it. options are definitely a different animal compared to shares and being long premium you will always be fighting against decay, meaning if the stock does nothing you will lose some amount of the time value left in them each and every day.

remember that the reason you have the asymmetric risk is that you are trading leverage for time."
2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Am I the only one that thinks the market has been sus lately? This is pure speculation and full smooth brain.


Since the start of the year the market has been completely different, understandable with the times we are in.

Yet, the volume continues to dry up. Spy and Qs are a shell of themselves. Each day it seems to be a bar brawl.

To me it looks like the algos are running the show and pick pocketing. Think that's strength building? Sike, just a bull trap. 

What am I missing? Did I miss a memo?

Edit: yes moves are made, but they are way different than the past. Guess it is what it is"
2021-05-07 20:02:22,wallstreetbets,It’s not uncommon for the market to sideways trade for months / years. Problem is 95% of wsb will go broke in that setting
2021-05-07 22:49:23,wallstreetbets,"How long have you been doing this? It is not unusual to see sideways movement for a while after such a melt up as we had last year. If you are newish to the Market, 2020 was bonkers. And 2016 to 2018 were exceptional years. Not to mention that we are in the longest bull market in history. So...."
2021-05-07 20:06:22,wallstreetbets,Been sus since 2009
2021-05-07 20:24:59,wallstreetbets,As far as I'm concerned this market should have collapsed into a blackhole like a year ago. But I'm not fighting then trend anymore. Spy calls every Monday don't care what anyone says.
2021-05-08 12:11:06,wallstreetbets,"Lately? It’s been over a year, buddy. The fact that the market didn’t lose half its value when COVID-19 hit really opened my eyes. This shit is just a huge gambling operation that’s based on emotions and what the government feels like doing; it has absolutely nothing to do with fundamentals."
2021-05-08 01:08:36,wallstreetbets,"It feels a lot like Feb 2000, when the dot com bubble was about to burst. I was in the thick of it... I was running a startup hoping to IPO, and I had dozens of friends who were paper millionaires with their stock options, and most wound up worthless. I started with $5k in 1998, and by 2000, I had over $200k in my Schwab account. I thought I had cracked the code, and I was feeling pretty invincible.

In Feb 2000, I shorted some tech stocks, then bailed when they kept going up and took my losses. As the bubble started to burst, I put all my money in ""safe"" profitable tech stocks (Cisco, Oracle, Network Solutions and Intel). A month later the bottom fell out. It was a roller coaster ride, with enough ups to make you think it was coming back. My ""safe"" stocks lost a bundle. I rode two companies into the ground, and lost 90% on others. 

Today, Cisco and Oracle are worth less than they were 21 years ago. Despite consistent earnings increases, they never grew into those valuations. (Yes, I wish I had put everything in AAPL, GOOG and AMZN instead).This market feels ""frothy"" (to quote someone smarter than I am). There will always be winners and losers, but when the market loses its collective mind every time someone says ""inflation"" or ""tightening"" it's concerning. I'm still long, but it seems like it's time to think about taking some chips off the table soon."
2021-05-08 01:31:33,wallstreetbets,"There are only 3 ways to win in the market. Be disciplined, have a large amount of money, or be plain lucky. Most retail investors, including me, will not have the last 2 factors. The first factor is hard to attain and will only happen once you have some setbacks.

And, please keep in mind that 2020 is an aberration, and these shit storms are what markets are made of. It will be hard, but riding the shit storm is part and parcel of being in markets."
2021-05-08 02:32:30,wallstreetbets,Brace yourselves - marketcrash is coming
2021-05-07 20:31:25,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-07 22:32:10,wallstreetbets,"The bubble, she is a popping. This is how that happens. Starts with the bubble boys a la palantir, TSLA etc. Eventually spreads to the rest of the market. 

Welcome to 2001"
2021-05-08 01:38:07,wallstreetbets,"The market has been going through a period of pricing in reopening and inflation since February imo. So many pandemic stocks way down, SPACs way down, high growth stocks bleeding, while value stocks and cyclic stocks are going up and up."
2021-05-08 02:26:09,wallstreetbets,"no you're the only one, how did none of us notice?"
2021-05-07 20:01:56,wallstreetbets,🌈🐻s getting an early start this weekend
2021-05-07 21:33:51,wallstreetbets,"Its always been. The positive reinforcement in the news acts as the disraction to surge retail buying in a time of institutional uncertainty and over-leveraging. That’s their exit plan. I think the rate hike & selloff is coming sooner than people realize. And if you’re one to take mainstream news at face value, you won’t even know it until its already over."
2021-05-07 20:03:49,wallstreetbets,Lately??? Were you asleep for all of 2020-today?
2021-05-08 01:06:43,wallstreetbets,"You mean moreso than usual? I'm sure there's lots of shady market manipulation going on by the big players (ex. Goldman Sachs) we're not privy to. This is not to mention the Fed artificially sets the price of money (interest rates) to manipulate the economy and it creates money out of nothing and ""loans"" it to the U.S. government at interest. Then there's fractional reserve banking and inflation. There's all kinds of distortions built into the system to help the powerful and connected elites become and remain wealthy. The rest of us are wandering blindly trying to profit from a system not designed for us. In other words the deck is stacked against the common man. Try to work hard, save, and invest and even if you do manage to gain a substantial return a large portion of it will be eaten up by taxes and inflation."
2021-05-07 20:00:25,wallstreetbets,"It’s just the time of the year we’re in, nothing is being allowed to run. Yes the market is heavily manipulated, but it’s still data driven and as such follows patterns. First half of May is almost always a bust, and then things ramp up 2nd half going into June for that quadruple witching. Algos have to save room to run but also reign in the market so it doesn’t run TOO much. It’s all part of a healthy market."
2021-05-08 01:53:00,wallstreetbets,I see a lot of red this past 3 months on stocks I own...
2021-05-07 20:01:48,wallstreetbets,Algos have been set to ‘stealth sell off’ mode and will continue to turn retail into bag holders whilst managing to keep the indices near all time highs by propping up boring companies that no one here would want to own.
2021-05-08 08:53:02,wallstreetbets,"Gentleman the problem is that so many Robinhooders, Redditors, etc are new to the game and young and full of piss and vinegar and into meme stock and bet stocks and think this is the ""grown-up"" alternative to betting MLB or NBA....well they are going to learn the hard way."
2021-05-08 00:55:29,wallstreetbets,Lmao is this some retard bear support thread?
2021-05-08 01:28:10,wallstreetbets,"It got weird as hell after Left called out PLTR and then GME. Before then, as a day trader with very little money, I was making 500 dollars a week and paying my bills and then everything EVERYTHING changed at that point. None stability in anything, any tip I’d research off of Reddit tanked."
2021-05-08 00:59:26,wallstreetbets,"Lemme guess, you've only been investing since 2018 or so?"
2021-05-08 02:56:43,wallstreetbets,The market is a bull market until otherwise.
2021-05-08 03:28:49,wallstreetbets,It’s like musical chairs.. just hope that when shit does hit the fan you have your ass in the right seat.
2021-05-08 14:46:13,wallstreetbets,"I’m thinking it has something to do with the fact that things are retuning you “normal” and volatility is dying down. Significantly. Most wsb is speculation based on volatility, and when we have no volatility, we make no tendies."
2021-05-07 20:24:00,wallstreetbets,I tell you whats sus is the rules only apply to the little guy.
2021-05-08 00:08:19,wallstreetbets,Have you seen today’s chart for UWMC?  It’s all rigged. Can’t wait for the GME squeeze to start the chain reaction.

2021-05-07 20:36:53,wallstreetbets,The market has always been sus. It’s just about which side of it you are on as to whether you like it or not.

But nobody can call the top. The air can get so paper-thin, the rally can get so retarded, nobody is gonna see it coming.

2021-05-08 08:01:35,wallstreetbets,"As far as a crash or the bubble popping. We wont see that until the stimulus’ end. Whether its unemployment, ebt, etc. once those go dry we will start to see the economy decline. Look at all the ERs we have had. Nearly every company blew it out and thats because everyone has money to spend."
2021-05-08 10:28:41,wallstreetbets,"It seems sus to me too, I’ve heard that there is a rotation out of growth and into value luckily I had plays in place for that too but that particular sector seems to be targeted to me.  It needed a pullback I suppose but it’s just getting clobbered relentlessly at this point, some of those companies deserve it some are killing it and getting clobbered anyway.  Whatever can just roll with the punches I guess

Also like you say there’s momentum then out of nowhere the bottom drops out you buy the dip and it bleeds out slowly more and more.  Long term it’s not that big a deal short term it’s annoying"

2021-05-08 17:20:10,wallstreetbets,You are right that something is going on. After a ten year bull run. I believe that the old “white” money is preparing for some change. Perhaps a usual cycle for them or they see the ape rocket going to the moon....who knows ?
2021-05-08 18:41:45,wallstreetbets,"The market we’ve seen for the past couple years has been a new beast. Opportunity for the common person to invest has created an influx of activity that can’t really be understood yet. What were seeing now has no relationship to what has happened in the past.

2021-05-08 07:18:55,wallstreetbets,I think your on to something there with the algos. Its like the twilight zone this market.
2021-05-07 23:07:16,wallstreetbets,"It's not uncommon for it to go down for a few months/years. I can't even imagine the bloodshed here. I mean, the market hit ATH and the daily discussion still makes it look like the world is ending."

2021-05-08 19:34:49,wallstreetbets,nah most people on this sub smart enough to switch to other strats to make money in sideways/down markets
2021-05-08 01:23:57,wallstreetbets,"It should have crashed multiple times last year but it didn't. Too much money on the top end pushing the stocks around, too many wankers thinking that the stock market is actually a reflection of the economy... when there record unemployment and underemployment.

It has a life of it's own at this point."
2021-05-08 02:28:13,wallstreetbets,and that is probably a good sign but I won't jinx it by saying why
2021-05-07 20:26:19,wallstreetbets,"True, idunno how I forgot that. Heavy pull back seems likely with how shit has ran with covid and other factors."
2021-05-08 16:30:48,wallstreetbets,"This is my feelings on it too. Global pandemic that shuts the economy down and reaches insane unemployment? Best we can do is a hard correction that washes away 2 years of a major bull run. Wowee that's bad /s. Oh and we need a vaccine to return the economy to normal, but we've never had a vaccine get created and approved in a year, but let's ignore all the doom and gloom and just rally back to ATH in less than 4 months.

We are obviously on the tail end of covid now in the US, and the roads are packed and people are eating out, but in my area there are vacant buildings left and right, companies and restaurants that pulled the plug and aren't coming back. Whether that's stores that have gone dark with no notice of closure for months, or commercial leasing signs in windows.

I don't agree with what happened in the markets in 2020, it should've been worse and taken long to rally back. But to reuse a famous quote:

>The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent

So just buy companies you'd hold for years and just accept what the markets are going to do, whether you agree with them or not."

2021-05-08 18:17:29,wallstreetbets,">IBs and tech are making a shit ton of money, but what about the rest of the country?

This has been worrying me for awhile (years).  Is tech going to fracture the economy in such a way that it basically defines 'tech workers' as a separate class?  I am a tech worker, but I very much do not want that to happen.  If SF is a preview... it's not a good look.  Software engineers making bank surrounded by a mass of homeless or struggling.  No thanks.

But on the other hand, there are so many strong pressures pushing things in that direction.  Wages died in 1980 and have been suppressed ever since while the government waits for everything to trickle down.  The business world, I think, had a psychological and moral crisis when computers entered the workplace.  From 1950 to 1980, productivity increased incrementally, and wages kept pace, average income of lower 90% (workers) rose by 75%.  Then from 1980 to 2010... that figure rose by 1%.  While productivity skyrocketed because computers were productivity multipliers, not an incremental improvement.  When an exec saw 7% productivity increase, he could give a 5% raise and pay himself on the back.  When he saw a 120% increase in productivity... he short circuited.  Controlling the cost of labor became more important than anything, including profit.  The whole 'work is compensated based upon the value it creates' went wholesale out the window.  Maybe economists have some idea of where that heads, I don't."

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Snail mail publications My son, who is not one of the brightest individuals on the planet, seems to think a subscription to IBD would help him advise me on what to do with his very little bit of money. He is currently vacationing at one of Florida states finest resorts. He gets out in 2023 and would like his very little bit of money to be more when he gets out. I think the subscription price of IBD ($347) makes it a stupid decision when you have $600 to play with. More importantly, I assume the bulk of the subscription is only usable digitally, and we all know those state resorts don't allow digital access. Any print info he receives would be days old by the time he gets it, making it nearly obsolete at times, wouldn't it?  I have no head for investing seriously. I play with what little I am willing to lose. The same way I treat casino's. Oh, and everything I touch turns to crap. So if you have someone that you want to get back for some past wrong doing, just find out what stocks they own the most of and let me know. The minute I buy anything it tanks immediately. I could do some damage without direct contact.

In my opinion the best fighters were in pride. 205 pound weight class and heavy weight class, they had some really good lighter weight fighters but they all should’ve been bantam weight or featherweight, those divisions just were not around then. Their top middleweight  fighter was Dan Henderson, who when they went to unify the title when he came to the UFC was beaten by Anderson Silva, who was a former pride fighter. Rampage Jackson came from pride won the light heavyweight belt, Nogueira came to the UFC and won the heavy weight belt. Chuck Liddell was the top guy in the UFC, when he went to pride rampage beat the shit out of him. So in my opinion pride definitely had the better fighters. And I personally don’t care if they were using steroids I would much rather my athletes be in the best shape that they could possibly be in."

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I valued MSFT at $ 244, they are doing surprisingly well Full report: [https://datastudio.google.com/s/pO1DcwglE7w](https://datastudio.google.com/s/pO1DcwglE7w)  
**In short, they are still growing on most segments, the CEO does smart acquisitions (usually at a bit of a premium).**

\--The Business--

Microsoft is a technology titan focused on commercial and industrial applications with software and solutions such as Office 365, Azure, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, Linkedin, Windows 10. They also provide platforms for developers via Visual Studio Code and Github. A smaller segment of Microsoft are their devices and their games division powered by Xbox.

**--Next Moves: Healthcare Applications--**

The healthcare sector is characterized by massive bureaucracy and opportunities for growth. It is one of the rare sectors where real future growth is possible by innovation. Microsoft has established itself as a corporate and industry suite, but now it seems that they are taking their whole Eco-system and moving on the healthcare industry.

This is pure speculation, but it can be one of the boldest moves yet, as healthcare facilities, operations, education, training, quality control are large complex systems that can benefit from the tools and services that the company offers.

We have seen Microsoft positioning for a certain client type and taking over most of their business. As the opportunities for growth in the corporate sector decrease, Microsoft might just turn to one of the most complex industries with high barriers to entry and large upfront investment costs.

On 11 April 2021 they entered into an agreement to acquire Nuance Communications for $ 56 per share, or $19.7 Billion. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. This is effectively their foot in the door to the healthcare industry.

**--Value--**

I think that the company is trading around its intrinsic value, with potential for growth in the future. There is inflation related market risk that can push down value, but with proper management and pricing flexibility they can at least sustain current value levels.

Microsoft solidified the cloud for the corporate & business sector, and decreased the risk of their sales by adopting a continuous subscription model for most of their services.

Their business model seems to be growth trough innovation as they are positioning themselves precisely in segments where innovation is lacking and are integrating those segments within their high-barrier to entry, complex systems.

\--**Product Breakdown--**

AZURE:  The backbone of the productivity suite for most of the western corporations 

Office:  Stabilized revenues for essential business tools

Windows 10:  Declining bloatware built upon old architecture 

LinkedIn:  Well positioned, profitable social network with long-term commuted users 

Dynamics/Viva:  A major competitor for CRM/ERP market-share with potential for innovation 

PowerApps:  The future tool for cutting operating expenses and bureaucracy for companies 

Devices: Uncertain potential for a better experience for Windows users. Augmented reality done right with industry application

GitHub, VS Code:  The platforms that will keep MSFT on the cutting edge of development tech

Gaming/Xbox: Large but risky potential for growth if the devices and games are improved

Microsoft has a wide and complex set of products and services which can be understood as cost cutting tools for businesses, system architecture utilities, productivity and effectiveness tools. 

They have created a well-thought off interconnected Eco-system that is nothing like the company was even five years ago.

It is now apparent that they are well positioned as a market leader for industrial and business applications and will further solidify their position in the future.

\--Competition--

We are already witnessing the convergence of competitive advantages between the technology titans of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and it is clear that all of them are fighting for market share in similar technologies and industries. 

It seems that every company is fighting for their specific industry positioning within technology. For example, Facebook, Microsoft and Google all experiment with Virtual Reality tools such as Google Glass, Oculus Rift and the HoloLens Headset from Microsoft. However MSFT seems to be the most successful as it is positioning for industrial, military and hybrid workspace applications for the headset - the others had less luck in the consumer/gaming sector application of VR.

Google, Amazon and Microsoft are likewise competing for cloud dominance, where Amazon AWS is positioning as a cost effective player for developers, MSFT is positioning as a stable and secure platform for companies and Google is positioning as an advanced cutting edge option for new technologies and companies that are able to scale.

The last example is between MSFT and GOOGL where they competed for the use of virtual conference apps driven by the new hybrid work culture from the pandemic. Both of the competitors had a variant starting off, MSFT had Skype/Teams, and Google had Hangouts/Meet. It is evident that Microsoft had the right approach with Teams and took over the commercial sector for online communication. Side note, Skype is a drain on the Microsoft brand since the appearance of the pretend close feature. It is irredeemable and should be retired.

DISCLAIMER: I do not own a MSFT position, I am planning to go long on MSFT next week.

THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE, I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL, I AM NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT YOUR GOALS AND SITUATION."
2021-05-08 01:18:21,wallstreetbets,"I love MSFT and have my entire life - but i can say one weakness they have is their big data platforms. Synapse is a fucking disaster.

Now not everyone is in big data platforms - some just want basic SQL right?

Azure SQL db is also a nightmare - it doesn't scale disk, which is a lot of workload for everything that isn't transactional.

OK so what about SQL on a VM like the old days?
Complicated as fuck licensing models for SQL on a VM mean that not even Microsoft can sort it out. We have like 100 SQL servers which should be like millions of dollars for Microsoft - but the servers change sizes often so how the fuck can we license them per core?! So we just did what any shop would do - reached out to Microsoft support and requested sales teams to look at our environment and quote us on what we need. This was followed by an official Microsoft audit where the auditors were so confused they just basically took a giant spreadsheet from us, looked at it, and said - yep everything seems in line here! You guys are all set! (we hadn't even made the purchases).

So yeah, im bullish on other tech in this area like snowflake db - but that isnt really working out for me."

My rationale is that because of the sheer number of people developing plugins and additions in vs, that msft can have a preview on what is going on in the industry and use analytics to get insight of which tech to develop next. This keeps them on the edge, not the platform by itself, although I enjoy vs quite a bit :)"

2021-05-08 00:21:39,wallstreetbets,"Airbnb doesn’t sell travel insurance while vrbo does. If you do the math on travel insurance commissions assuming a 50-50 split, and 20% acceptance rate they would be able to grow revenue overnight by 15-18% upselling to guests at checkout. In addition I don’t agree with their core strategy prioritizing independant owners over property managers. PM’s consistantly make 3-4x more than self managed homes. Vrbo recognizes this and is much more PM friendly. Also, airbnb is guest centric and prioritizes them over the host while vrbo is more even balanced. Many hosts havent forgotten their COVID blanket refund antics and I believe there’s still lawsuits outstanding. Lastly their support is ass. Just this week their host CS couldnt escalate a software issue for an integrated PM to the proper tech support (again because they don’t prioritize PM’s), and if the CS suggestions had been followed I’d still have a property that wasn’t live and booking. I went through my software CS to resolve it with airbnb’s tech support. Airbnb CS said wait and let it fix itself for 72 hours even though it’d been broken for 2 weeks."
2021-05-08 14:51:27,wallstreetbets,"Ahhh ok, so if I was a PM I would definitely go to vrbo because I wouldn’t worry about property destruction because I’d be covered vs abnb which tends to be nightmarish for getting compensated. However as a customer I’m probably using Airbnb because of brand recognition and ease of use is the first thing. Vrbo seems like it needs to steal mkt shr from abnb which is possible but abnb is more widely recognized. Also as a PM wouldn’t I want to go where there’s more customer demand/increased chance of profit?"
2021-05-08 15:09:00,wallstreetbets,"Depending on the market Vrbo is dominate, and we seem to see more high paying guests on Vrbo than Airbnb. Part of this is the platform design- airbnb is designed so that potential guests can try to haggle. I’m confident expedia’s team will execute on growth goals."
2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Yo! cramers says that you hate GE? This true? Discramer ahead: I am as retarded ass they cum.

One thing I’ve learned in my experience on WSB is that Cramer is often is 99% wrong. Summers coming up and maybe I am misguided but does money start flowing into industrials? The meme sentiment for GE is at an all time low currently, and probably always will be. Mark says not to get into GE, so maybe it’s a huge gamble. Gambling is pretty fun, discussing such gambles is pretty fun as well. Bill says %80 renewables over the next 20 years, I like windmills, so does GE.  It’s a pretty small sector compared to the rest of the Corp. The free float is mammoth there’s absolutely no way to make a dent in it. So not good for a quick buck I am guessing. And there’s no way I could own all of GE anyhow so I don’t know why I am bothering. But I am going to buy shares here and there.

https://preview.redd.it/0vfuohmplrx61.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=60ec4444fbbf936dcac53ffdca7f5f0d530789e1

Let's get some facts straight, because it hurts me to see how all of you amateurs are being played by the master poker players of Wall Street.

# Real Estate prices

Home prices are hitting record highs. Record low supply of homes. New listings selling on average in just 18 days, also a record pace. 48% of buyers are confident now is the right time to buy real estate. Where are these people getting the money from, you ask? By taking MORTGAGES! High lumber prices, high copper prices, high home prices? Yup, all that money comes from mortgages. Power to those who buy houses with cash, but most of the people need a mortgage. And guess who is in the mortgage business? You betcha, UWMC.

# RKT's earnings were a dissaster, UWMC's will too

Ummm, did you know Mat Ishibia (the CEO of UWMC) gave an ultimatum about a month ago, that brokers must choose who they want to work with. Either RKT or UWMC. Guess whom they picked?

Listen to the CEO: ""*out of my 12000 brokers less than 500 said they were gonna go with them, you will see that in the Q2 numbers*"" - [https://twitter.com/RickardBalls/status/1390088528764284935?s=20](https://twitter.com/RickardBalls/status/1390088528764284935?s=20)

https://preview.redd.it/8gwamgh5nrx61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ea48f104e76caf6a368cbe5ef2a9b86ae43eebc

# Dividend

I know most of you goofs here do not care about dividend because you are all busy making 100% a week gains, but in the real world, where you actually do get to drive a lambo, consistent predictable income like dividends are a big deal. You see, UWMC pays $0.40 per year for every share you own. This is fixed! It does not matter how much the stock price is. However, what matters is that your dividend yield depends on the price you pay to acquire those shares. Confused? Let me give you an example:

* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $10 a share) = 4.00% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $9 a share) = 4.44% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $8 a share) = 5.00% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $7 a share) = 5.71% annual dividend yield - **WE ARE HERE!**
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $5 a share) = 8.00% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $3 a share) = 13.33% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $1 a share) = 40.00% annual dividend yield

Basically, it's a gift from heavens to be able to buy a dividend paying stock at low levels because you are locking in a higher % return. Now some of you smartypants will say, *""don't buy a stock just for the dividend""*, and I agree. In some cases, when the company **does not generate cash flow** they will have trouble paying the dividend and will be forced to cut it. However, **UWMC** has no problem with cash flow, meaning $0.40 dividend per share is here to stay for the foreseeable future.

Fun fact, RKT pays no dividend. Institutions know this. They care about predictable stream of cash a.k.a. dividends. BlackRock knows this, hence why they reported on May 2, owning 11.15% of UWMC's float.

# Russell Index

Remember the Russell index hype? Remember how the price went from $7.63 to $9.62 in a matter of few days?

https://preview.redd.it/1tb8i3ikprx61.png?width=1348&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2b49973b32b0f6171a51cbf110250ab48b3187d

Well the inclusion story is still pretty much on the table. Russell made a mistake. UWMC is in touch with them and **UWMC is eligible for consideration at the annual review in June 2021**. Yes, that's in about a month from now. Don't believe me? You should.

# Bluffing

The definition of bluffing in poker is - ***betting heavily on a weak hand in order to deceive opponents***. I know what you beginners fear - ""*What if my stock goes to zero?*"" Do you hear yourself? America's largest wholesale dividend paying mortgage broker soon to join Russell 1000 going to zero? Are you that dumb? Did Wall Street pros managed to fool you that much? Remember bluff stories like:

* **We covered on GME** \- No you did not! The stock ain't going below $100 and it's been months since you covered!
* **AMC is going bankrupt** \- No it's not! It went up 348% since January 2021!
* **UWMC is worthless. You should buy real estate at all time highs, let us buy this shitty dividend paying stock that's going to zero.** \- Are you gonna fall for it again?

# Mathematical pressure

You see, when you deal with single digit stocks like AMC at $2 in January 2021, GME at $5 in August 2020, there is a point at which there is just no meat left. There is only a bone. You can't short stock into an oblivion. There is nothing left to short! You are running a risk.

At some point, the rewards from going long way outweigh the risk of going short on a beaten down stock. Melvin did not understand this concept and that's why he lost billions. Simple as that.

You wanna buy low and sell high. Not short sell low and buy to cover high.

# Holiday Party

Does your company invite Ludacris to sing at your holiday party? Well, UWMC does.[https://www.facebook.com/UnitedWholesaleMortgage/videos/2018-holiday-party/2210042152580237/](https://www.facebook.com/UnitedWholesaleMortgage/videos/2018-holiday-party/2210042152580237/)

2021-05-08 06:54:12,wallstreetbets,"I think UWMC got to be everyone's punching bag. It gets hate for being a SPAC, being mentioned on WSB but without a strong following within the sub, and for being a mortgage company associated with Rocket even though they didn't even report earnings yet.

2021-05-08 12:31:46,wallstreetbets,Its an amazing entry point if you own none of the share. Only have 250 at around 8.50 but gonna double up Monday. Just gonna hold it long. Rates will always go up just like the price of a tin of coke. Screw all these butter-handed fools who sell 😁
2021-05-08 13:27:31,wallstreetbets,3100@ $8.35 and planning to double that Monday after some profit-taking on CVS. I like the ~~stock~~ dividend.

If it dropped to $1 it'd be a godsend, 40% guranteed yearly returns. Every penny I make would go in

Having dividend helps the stock to not become a penny stock and in based of my experience high expectations drop the stock after earnings ($RKT).

A stock going to zero may not be a real concern, but losing 50% would be devastating for small traders (if I can even call myself that) like myself.

I've got 1200 shares, and some calls. My gut says buy more, my brain says I don't know shit and I'm going to lose even more money.

The other day u/Nrdrage said when $pltr hit 22 it would trigger a volitility event. It hit 22 and fell through the floor.  How did he know that? Until I figure out things like that I'm going to be  a lot more conservative  in my choices.

(1) Why does EPS show ""NA"" when the company reported FY20 net income of $3.38 billion? Was it non GAAP earnings?  
(2) Why start a $0.10 dividend a few months before issuing $700 Million of 5.500% Senior Notes Due 2029? If they need to go to the markets to raise money, why pay a dividend, and how safe will the market think that dividend is?

You make some good points, and I don't know enough about it to understand the details. I'm perplexed about selling 5.5% senior notes while starting a new dividend, though. If they're making that much profit, why the new offering?"

2021-05-08 05:58:45,wallstreetbets,"Have you looked at their cashflow statement or balance sheet?? ....they have been generating negative cashflows over the past year. 

No debt? They have close to $1bn of debt as of 4Q 2020.

How have they been able to maintain cash and pay dividends? Issuance of shares....they made $425mn off of new share issuance in 2020. 

Operating cash flow... -2mn in 2020...they aren't covering their costs from operations so they need to either issue more shares or acquire more debt.

1Q might prove that they are cashflow positive and that could drive the stock up, but there is no indication from the past 12 months that they don't have cashflow issues.

They have been covering their negative operating cash flow through new equity and debt raises. This isn't a good sign considering their margins.

Dude I know that you think this company is under priced and maybe it is. Perhaps it will go up. But at least look at their financial statements before making a claim that they have plenty of cashflow and no debt."

2021-05-07 21:20:19,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is in different though situation though.

UWMC is at their all time low. They have 5.7% dividend yield at the moment.

The market has super low expectation for UWMC.

In part, with the business combination having closed in January, there is no reported EPS for 2020. Also, no full year financials available yet. However, we can calculate EPS our selves.

2020 Q4 actual: $0.62 EPS confirmed by UWMC investor relations.

2020 FY actual: $1.53 EPS also confirmed by UWMC investor relations.

&#x200B;

Here is the expectations:

2021 Q1 estimate: $0.41 EPS

2021 Q2 estimate: $0.35 EPS

2021 FY estimate: $1.27 EPS"
2021-05-07 23:05:13,wallstreetbets,"Simple as that. You wanna buy shoes when they are on sale, not when the price goes up."
2021-05-08 03:44:52,wallstreetbets,"Don't wait till price is high brother, all time low right now"
2021-05-08 00:51:35,wallstreetbets,I see what you did there.
2021-05-07 20:50:44,wallstreetbets,"Also, the price reflect low estimates.

Q1 2021 estimate: $0.41 EPS

Q2 2021 estimate: $0.35 EPS

FY 2021 estimate: $1.27 EPS

However, Q4 2020 actual: $0.62 EPS.

Because UWMC being SPAC and haven't released full year financials yet, market haven't been able to fully ""graded"" UWMC yet, so whacky estimates."
2021-05-07 20:36:04,wallstreetbets,"Damn, they should do a massive dividend at some point. Shorts would be forced to cover or pay the dividend themselves on their loaned shares. Not to mention the price would (temporarily) jump because of the dividend itself.

Or even better if they do it in smaller surprise chunks. Small enough that each one looks like it's manageable which will make it harder to not continue doubling down for each subsequent one until the total surpasses the amount they got shorting it in the first place (and then they still have to cover if they haven't already)."
2021-05-07 23:12:59,wallstreetbets,"This is **irresponsibly** wrong DD. How do you even *get* numbers that wrong? A company with booked profits of $13 per share would be worth almost *half* that? What kind of bullshit is this? You actually have to *try* to pass off as legitimate information this blatantly false.

For starters, if you don't count the cash infusion from their recent IPO, they actually have *fewer* assets in Q4 2020 than they did in Q4 2019.

They also made a loss -- a **bigger** loss in Q4 2020 compared to 2019 --at a time when home-buying is going *nuts*. The loss was 0.12c per share. *How* would that equate to being able to pay a dividend of $13 per share?

Finally, they have 425m in assets. If they could have paid a dividend of $13 per share, that money doesn't simply fucking disappear. It would be in their books as cash, or used to purchase assets, which would also be reflected in the books.

So, let's reflect:

* They only have 425m in assets

* That 425m was cash raised from a SPAC IPO

* They actually made a loss during the hottest home-buying market I've ever been alive for

* People on the Internet are lying about their fundamentals

* Fuck you. Fuck you so goddamned much."
2021-05-07 20:04:10,wallstreetbets,Amen brother! Finally someone intelligent here. I want them to pay me to own a lending business.

2021-05-07 20:41:59,wallstreetbets,"Yea, but the story behind is roughly 12% of the float is currently SI; however, I did see a post detailing 25% but I'm not certain about the data. In the past 2 months, approximately 34% of the float has been bought by institutions and mutual funds:  [UWMC - UWM Holdings Corp Shareholders - CNNMoney.com](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=UWMC&subView=institutional) .

Additionally iBorrowDesk which tracks the shares available to short at interactive brokers says it's being shorted like crazy:  [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC)

With Russel inclusion coming up, much more outstanding shares will be purchased as well.

The shorts got really greedy on this one with a really bad bet. They're about to be burnt as fuel in this rocket."
2021-05-08 02:16:00,wallstreetbets,This is my sentiment as well.
2021-05-08 03:05:26,wallstreetbets,"Foreclosures means more supply to fuel the massive demand, and more mortgages.  Population growth plus increasing immigration will lead to even more demand.  Look around, real estate industry isn't slowing down anytime soon.  You are just scared of the ghost of 2008, but lending standards are way better now and subprime isn't a thing anymore.  When fears of inflation abound, what do smart, wealthy people do?  Buy Real Estate."
2021-05-08 08:05:10,wallstreetbets,"Housing shortage means UWMC has no reason to loan money unless the person is extremely low risk of defaulting. This has been talked about before about UWMC only giving loans to low risk individuals. 

A housing shortage means a bottle neck in mortgages. Even if foreclosures shot up there is a line of people waiting to buy them.

Not worried at all about this company failing."
2021-05-07 21:44:59,wallstreetbets,Except my confirmation bias is confirmed by good ol fashioned cash.

We also didn’t get included in Russell 1000 on a technicality which hurt us but fundamentals of the company are sound. With that being said if it hits anything over 12 after ER I am jumping out of this thing. Simply because it’s movement makes no sense to me and I’m tired of trying to justify it.

2021-05-08 16:59:17,wallstreetbets,"This the spirit! I love it brother. Let them drop it even more, I'll suck in the shares like a vacuum."
2021-05-07 21:22:31,wallstreetbets,They can. The only reason a company would stop paying dividend is if they have problems with cash flow. UWMC has plenty of cash.
2021-05-07 21:21:20,wallstreetbets,Didn't say that. Let's get to $12 first.
2021-05-07 21:31:57,wallstreetbets,"Let’s get to $10 there champ, than we’ll think about $13, etc."

2021-05-07 22:16:08,wallstreetbets,"Even if it goes lower after ER, they'll met with even more share purchases from me. Basically they won't be able to get rid of me. Either we go to $0 and I buy the whole float or we go to the moon. There is no third option."
2021-05-07 21:19:54,wallstreetbets,"Inventory was severely limited until recently, but it’s still low. Just because it’s a seller’s market doesn’t mean loan origination volume is as high or higher than before. Gross volume might actually be lower. Not saying that is the situation, but that is a reasonable explanation."
2021-05-07 23:21:57,wallstreetbets,"The mortgage market is currently pricing in a massive rate hike and major downturn in home sales like we saw back in 07.

It's overshooting to the downside ATM in a big way with UWMC. Just need to wait until everyone who wants to sell has finished selling, and up she goes. All those sellers will of course run paid articles telling everyone that it's going to keep going lower.

The mean for this stock is $12, so it will most likely overshoot to $20 before the end of the year."
2021-05-07 20:05:53,wallstreetbets,"That's right brother. I dare them to let me acquire shares cheaper than all the investors before, considering we are all time lows."
2021-05-08 04:09:14,wallstreetbets,I sold 10 of them as well on Friday. It's gonna have to dip below $6.75 before I lose on the trade. I'll probably sell more on Monday.
2021-05-07 21:24:03,wallstreetbets,There may not be any shares left at $1 because I'll buy the whole float.
2021-05-08 00:58:36,wallstreetbets,"You're welcome. Read on selling options strategies. I did not buy puts. I sold puts, which is actually a bullish strategy. I'm collecting premium from put buyers, promising them I'll buy the shares if they drop below the strike price at the expiry date.

We got played on the SPAC valuation tho, which should have been illegal. They valued the company at just 9.5X 2021 net incomes. Well now it’s being valued at not even 5 times net incomes. What the hell changed for them to just half the value multiple? Nothing. If you kept their original 9.5X value the stock would be around $15 so at $8 or under I think you get free money. Let’s see"

It's always UWMC. ALWAYS. I had several brokers say that they don't do work with Rocket anymore because any sort of contacts they put into their system, Rocket then sends it to it's retail division and has their staff snipe the customer. I also bought this at 7.00 a share and I have no understanding on how this can go lower given the current market conditions. I'm going to dump more on them if they dip on earnings miss. This is not PLTR, GME, or AMC. This is a money printing machine."

2021-05-08 13:14:36,wallstreetbets,For now… for now… it’s easy to get a mortgage or refinance your home at these rates: But higher rates for mortgages on houses that are at ATHs? That’s gonna hurt.

I work for a direct lender now, but when I was on the broker side, I sent about 85-90% of my business to them. They have competitive rates and good support. They’re fast.

2021-05-08 14:24:30,wallstreetbets,The stock has been trading from$7.50 to $8.50 or higher the past few months. I'll sell the puts when it's close to $7.5 and then buy them back if the stock goes higher or theta decays. I was assigned on some last month but the share price rose to $7.80 or something and I sold them. I sold the $7p yesterday thinking that I can do the same thing.
2021-05-07 21:04:39,wallstreetbets,I agree that it seems like a bad decision to sell at an all time low from a company making loads of money and giving out a dividend as a near guarantee for shareholders to make money back. We'll see what happens Monday.

Instead of buying 10,000 shares directly. I suggest you sell puts. They can be ATM or slightly ITM if you are feeling bullish, but I want you to exhaust them. They got themselves into this trap of pushing a stock down to $7. Make them pay you to buy the shares."

2021-05-07 21:37:10,wallstreetbets,"Other theater chains did a much better job before and during Covid.  AMC has long leases on their theater locations instead of owning them, leaving huge liabilities to maintain in underperforming/unprofitable locations.  They took a long time, to figure out private theater rentals to bring in some income in areas that allowed it.  By me the AMC theaters stayed shut, when the Marcus cinemas opened for private party rentals, so a family could rent the whole place out for 100-200 bucks depending on day and movie.  Plus Marcus theaters here have beer on tap, and burgers that are fresh cooked and brought to you.  Renting out a whole theater for my family and out next door neighbors that we isolated with  was less expensive per person than pre pandemic and didn't have to deal with anyone we didn't know.  AMC by us has the same crap popcorn, candy, soda options it always has and took an extra 9 months to figure out that making some money is better Than nothing."
2021-05-08 09:38:55,wallstreetbets,Are you sure? Thats more than $22 a share.
2021-05-07 22:45:53,wallstreetbets,"Some of these people are so clueless , they don’t know the difference between a regular dividend and a special dividend.  I’m expecting UWMC to even raise those current divided which will be mind blowing"

2021-05-08 08:23:01,wallstreetbets,"This literally shows exactly the same thing I was talking about. $1bn in debt and net negative cashflow. 

Sure their net income is high but that's not the same as cashflow."
2021-05-07 22:22:10,wallstreetbets,"Yep, all i heard was horror stories from people trying to book a 'private' AMC movie, even recently. They couldn't even get out of their own way enough to rent entire fucking theatres for 150 bucks.

Theres also zero innovation or special thing about a movie theatre lately. Their biggest tech advancement in 20 years was being able to buy tickets and choose seats electronically. Even then it took them WAY to long to figure that out and they needed outside help like FANDANGO or whatever.

Fuck AMC. There is no way they bounce back and become profitable with HBO MAX hitting the scene and rising minimum wages."
2021-05-08 10:01:05,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Using just the 100 million Class A shares, it translates to over $22 per share. Using all issued shares (100 million Class A and 1.5 billion shares of Class D), it translates to about $1.45 per share."

2021-05-07 23:41:51,wallstreetbets,That's why I haven't bought a ticket at an AMC theater in.. 10 years.  The Marcus theater by me will bring you a cooked to order burger and fries for what a medium popcorn costs at AMC.  That with the private theater booking made it fun to go to again.  Having Guinness on tap in the lobby makes the kids movies much more bearable as well.
2021-05-08 10:42:48,wallstreetbets,"So the correct price to book value would be 4.83, slightly higher than rkt?"

2021-05-07 20:46:42,wallstreetbets,In what way. To expect it to decrease? Talking about it and seeing the numbers are two different things.
2021-05-08 11:00:22,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no. RKT already reported Q1 earnings. 

Using unrounded numbers, price to book for UWM is 4.7 as of Q4. I expect this to be 3.65-ish by Q1. This would be lower than the 4.3 number reported by Rocket in Q1."
2021-05-08 15:13:41,wallstreetbets,This is the way. You are going places my friend.
2021-05-07 21:01:36,wallstreetbets,Yes expect it to decrease 200-235 bps expected for Q1 2021 so no surprise there. You should do your own homework though that's the path to diamond hands. It's straight outta last earnings call.
2021-05-07 21:05:19,wallstreetbets,I’m with you and at 200-235 bps they are barely going to generate any free cash flow.. I’ll make my profits as this keeps dropping.
2021-05-07 21:45:34,wallstreetbets,"Just like how Costco not making any money with 7% margin when other grocers are pulling in 15%+.

UWMC had 249 bps in 2020 so not a big of drop as you are making out to be and it is already known.

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tired of Boeing? Hop in into the $ERJ plane 🚀🚀🚀 Listen fellow retards, we all know that all the recovery is mostly priced in in most well known stocks. Airlines are mostly at pre pandemic levels, same with hotels and other areas.

However, some plane manufacturers are still at super low levels. BA is a good example but now I want to bring you another one from Brazil: $ERJ.

Right now, this beauty is sitting at $12.89 while its all time highs back in 2019 were at $27. Plus, they are really digging into the smaller plane market across the world, taking a chunk of the market that used to be served by Boeing:

https://www.journal-aviation.com/en/news/46019-embraer-won-several-new-mro-contracts-in-commercial-aviation

Why buy this instead of Boeing? I actually own both, as one can be a hedge in case the other falls but both should go up from current levels in the longer term. Also, the upside is much better than Airbus, which is almost at pandemic level.

Current positions on $ERJ: 74 $10 7/16 calls
Positions on $BA: 21 $29 11/19 calls

Only regional carriers like SkyWest use them and they already have existing orders placed, not any new major orders.

Edit: Also that article you linked to just means Embraer themselves won a maintenance contract to maintain the very same planes they sold. MROs (maintenance, overhaul, and repair facilities) are typically operated by other companies like Aersale and AAR, and have very little input from the aircraft manufacturer."

2021-05-08 12:26:32,wallstreetbets,"Because it is very likely the SEC is working together with hedgefunds in order to artificially contain GME's price until after this rule is implemented in order to prevent a massive market collapse. If it pops off before the rule is implemented, and it very well could, then it would collapse the entire rest of the economy, like a 2008 times a hundred kinda damage."
2021-05-07 23:48:40,wallstreetbets,"Yup, and nothing has changed yet other than the pressure on the powder keg has been steadily increasing forcing hedges to maintain lower and lower sell walls in order to prevent things from spiraling out of control as the margin call threshhold continues to creep lower."

2021-05-08 19:02:15,wallstreetbets,"That would be bad for Game stop in the long run as that would lead to massive job losses and no one to buy from their online store.

2021-05-07 20:05:08,wallstreetbets,the nature of a short squeeze obliterates the concept of market cap. check porsche and VW. VW became the most valuable company in the world briefly during its short squeeze.

2021-05-07 20:48:01,wallstreetbets,"VW tripled its value from 100m to 300m which is astonishing while GME is already trading 8x what it was before it popped the first time.  Now it needs to be worth 700x what it’s worth now to hit $100,000/share.  A successful squeeze to 1000 a share would be impressive, 10,000 or 100,000 isn’t feasible.

So instead of multiple hedgefunds stock portfolios being simultaneously emptied out onto the open market crashing the prices of virtually everything, they instead simply change ownership directly to another healthy hedge and have minimal effect on the stock price."

2021-05-08 03:33:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, obviously... did you see the spike in January? Stocks don’t usually go up like 4000% dude. It was insanely awesome. 

The thing is for some reason many of you are stuck in the past and think that, by some miracle, this will not only happen again, but harder lol.

Completely forgetting the fact that it’s completely impossible for a short squeeze to happen without: 1) Surprise: 2) Short period of time which causes a nuclear reaction

GME has neither, which is why it’s behaving like a boomer stock. 

I seriously admire the sheer stupidity and ignorance of WSB"
2021-05-07 21:11:43,wallstreetbets,"During the squeeze VW jumped 1,500 times it's initial value, it SETTLED at 3 times it's initial value AFTER the squeeze. During the squeeze it had a market cap of 364 BILLION with a B. https://www.cnbc.com/id/27414247

It seems you are unaware of what a short squeeze is, and the mechanics of it."
2021-05-07 21:19:50,wallstreetbets,"The price of gme before all of this information is irrelevant due to the manipulation that forced the price so low. Current evaluation of the company don't put this stock anywhere near a $5-$20 evaluation. So it's only fair to do a fair evaluation and the way Stockswithbruce did his, he valued the company at around $600 if the projected e-commerce sales hit the projections he proposed which is very feasible."
2021-05-08 10:27:03,wallstreetbets,"Yup. I am. Because the tradeoff of selling them vs keeping them in the (very unlikely) advent it goes boom is not worth it.

Still makes me laugh how some people will still be screaming ANYTIME NOWWWW in 10 years."
2021-05-07 21:13:52,wallstreetbets,"Well, the short interest is estimated to be well above 200%. The current float is about 21-23million shares and retail alone easily owns more than that."
2021-05-08 00:18:10,wallstreetbets,"Not at all, it has been calculated by many people to be at least 140% currently, and possibly as high as 1200%. The 20% is self reported by people who have a self interest in lying about their numbers, and one of them was just caught purjuring himself in front of congress yesterday. People have been keeping track of borrowed shares since febuary, and just since then there had been over 70 million shares borrowed to short. Over 4 million shares had been shorted in just the past week and a half in order to desperately keep the share price from crossing the 185 mark."
2021-05-08 09:03:06,wallstreetbets,If you are not invested somewhat in gme at this point you are literally hanging your ass out in the wind

""Buy the ticket, take the ride"""
2021-05-07 21:16:18,wallstreetbets,"People have pointed to a stock that rose to $25k per share due to a 40% short interest. If a short interest of 40% does that to a stock, what does a 200+% short interest do to a stock?

Edit: the stock in question is DGAZF"
2021-05-07 23:21:08,wallstreetbets,"There are numerous short interest reports, but they are self reported by the very people who have a VERY strong self interest to fudge the numbers, and have been shown repeatedly to be lying about it. The head of Melvin capital was just caught purjuring himself in front of congress yesterday in fact. So yes i would say
""misrepresenting the truth"" may be an extreme understatement, it has been so obvious that the DTCC and SEC have new rules coming out at some point in the next two days that would require far more intensive reporting measures be taken in order to sift through the lies, and just today a new rule was put into effect 006 that blocks those who are the target of the more intensive rules from blocking their implementation which is what they have been doing up till this point. Basically they are sus as fuck."
2021-05-08 09:01:50,wallstreetbets,"It already happened 2 more times since january dude, both times being held back by hundreds of thousands of more shares being borrowed and shorted. This thing is more of a powderkeg than its ever been."
2021-05-07 21:18:47,wallstreetbets,"I’m seeing it traded at around 20 a share prior to squeeze jumped to 61 and then settling briefly around 30 before dipping to around $10-$20 for the next several years, what am I missing?"
2021-05-08 01:14:07,wallstreetbets,They'll be the main 3rd party retailer aside from psn and Xbox. And challenging with sale seasons. I just bought a game from them that was on sale but full price on PlayStation store. They'll dominate that market and that's just their bottom line...
2021-05-08 10:36:44,wallstreetbets,Alright so hold your shares and don't worry about what others are doing buddy
2021-05-08 00:41:40,wallstreetbets,"Estimated by who? This is basically saying that short interest has gone *up* 60% after *two* short squeezes - when there's still arguably an extended short squeeze happening right now. And even if 200% is true, how does that add up to a 5, 6 or 7 digit price? Where are the stats on what % of float retail holds?"
2021-05-08 00:01:59,wallstreetbets,All tickets are going to win. How much depends of u.
2021-05-08 01:05:31,wallstreetbets,"All shorts have to cover period. If no one paper hands at 1K, 10K, 100K. Then 1 mill is possible. Apes own the float, Shitadel has to buy back our shares to cover. Simple as that 🚀🚀🚀"

2021-05-08 15:17:07,wallstreetbets,"No dude, you literally don’t understand anything. Both times were due to a catalyst, and both times due to the high degree of volatility, etc.

By definition it CANNOT happen again, especially not ridiculous things like 500k per share, it’s physically impossible, not trying to be a downer but just facts. anybody who says 500k a share is either a troll who wants you to lose money, or a retarded who started trading yesterday. 

there are no catalysts left for GME, nothing, just sideways treding in a mean reverting way until it goes back to its fundamental level of about 30 dollars according to its earnings, etc"
2021-05-07 21:19:48,wallstreetbets,"You are missing the point where it jumped up to $6100 per share during the squeeze, not 61, you are missing some zeros.

And here is the nasty part, the VW squeeze was with a short interest of about 30%, GME currently has an estimated short interest of AT LEAST 140%."
2021-05-08 10:55:23,wallstreetbets,I’m not “worrying” this other dude was asking whats going on and your comment is just as valid as mine lol.
2021-05-08 00:48:42,wallstreetbets,We'll have a clearer picture after the vote. But the research into naked shorting and FTDs are irrefutable at this point. We just have to wait and see to what degree those practices have played a part in the GME saga.
2021-05-08 18:06:12,wallstreetbets,"I agree the price talks are pretty wild, but why would you think there are no catalysts left?!?! They have cash and no debt...they could buy an esports company...Q2 reports could be out of the roof due to the press, and consoles and computer parts are still backordered.  I feel like there are a few catalysts left."
2021-05-08 19:23:44,wallstreetbets,"Actually before both price explosions we saw extremely level price action exactly as we are seeing now and no catalyst at all other than the shorters falling behind or slipping up for a moment. they are currently borrowing and shoring 400,000 shares PER DAY in order to contain the price, and they are just barely doing so. They slipped up slightly last monday and the price jumped 40 dollars in 9 minutes. this keg is already under a crazy amount of pressure that is ACTIVELY, not passively being contained via monumental, likely very illegal, efforts. A catalyst is not needed, all that is, is for the shorters to fall behind even for a moment."
2021-05-08 00:01:10,wallstreetbets,And VW calmly sent a letter notifying the market they cornered it and allowed shorts to gently and orderly leave their positions.  Does that sound consistent with what those around here are going to do?
2021-05-08 00:51:52,wallstreetbets,The research is irrefutable based on what? Whose research?
2021-05-07 20:04:05,wallstreetbets,"Other than actual math? Sure people can make up “DD” that’s says it will go to a bajillion, but.. yea. Hold if you’d like, but don’t sell the koolaid to others."
2021-05-08 00:06:49,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely fucking not lol. Although Gamestop has issued several notices that they are aware that their stock has an ""unprecedented short interest"" so that is probably about as close as we are going to get to that."

2021-05-08 13:35:41,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the confirmation bias but I don’t think the pain is over yet. We might see $15-17 post earnings. I plan on doubling down at those levels. My current position is 900 shares at $24 plus 7 1/22 $20c.

2021-05-07 21:54:47,wallstreetbets,Only thing keeping PLTR above $15 is ARK buying it.  I think it's a good long term buy and will look to buy back in at some point but not now.
2021-05-08 00:43:05,wallstreetbets,"I looked at the 3month chart last week and all I saw was lower highs and lower lows…a down escalator…right into a den of angry bears.

you just need to buy a good company and hold it, and don't trade based on news and message board posts!

PLTR is much cheaper than it was, so you're getting a good deal, buy and forget about it

buy a good company low and sell high and you make money, it's that fucking simple -- but there's a lot of people who make money by telling YOU what to think"

Gme, AMC, bb, nok, cgc and some other were the talk of the town and flavors of the month. Cnbc, Jim ass Cramer, fox news and many others had been running news non stop during the 🚀. Now that direction has turned to some doggy coin and a weed smoking car manufacturer about to show up on Saturday night live.

Can the attention come back to these memes? Sure. Can these meme take off 1000% sure. But you gotta ask yourself if you are willing to baghold these maybes while other autists are making cold hard cash on AAPL and MSFT while you see deep red in your portfolio."

2021-05-08 11:48:15,wallstreetbets,"I  think the basic fallacy that most make regarding GME short interest is assuming the cost basis of their shorts. Professionals move in and out  of short positions regularly, sometimes several times per day, if a stock has adequate movement. And they set stop losses.

A lot of the current short interest for GME was opened up north of $200 for example and they are sitting in a bowl of gravy right now. It's true in Jan a few sucker hedge funds got trapped by the low volume and couldn't get out but the short interest ratio is like half a day now. It's almost impossible for them to get trapped in a bad position.

There  is a lot of money to be made in GME trading just understand what the opposition is actually doing. They are not the static meme retards you expect. They are entirely different retards. :)"

2021-05-08 03:42:12,wallstreetbets,">GME not having reoccurring value

You have no idea what you are talking about.

The e-sports scene is worth more then all professional sports combined, and its growing exponentially. Nobody has moved to take a stranglehold on this massive, massive, massive market. It looks to me like thats exactly GameStops play in the near future and when they do convert the majority of their capital to gobbling up that market as a whole GME will be worth the same if not more than the likes of the highest priced stocks on the market right now. The team is there, the foundation is there, the die hard fans with money to blow are there, the positive attention is there, the story of the underdog coming back despite all odds is there, the need to fill that void is there, the fastest growing market is theirs to grab and accelerate the growth even more. There's an unlimited amount of possibility and talent driving this forward... VS. a handfull of movie theaters that will not sustain a net profit after the excitement.

There is absolutely no comparison, none, nada, ziltch. GME is THE play not just now but also in the future. If apes on the other side do not see the difference then they just ain't going to. 

This is unprecedented and will be talked about long, long, long after AMCs hype has dwindled after the fact. This is just one reason why GME is THE play and AMC just cannot compete with the future possibilities. 

I'm sorry but its painfully obvious to me and its surprising its not to others also. Good luck comrades."

2021-05-08 02:22:00,wallstreetbets,I'd rather buy in for a long term play after capitalizing on a short term squeeze. It could take years for earnings to catch up with the price.
2021-05-08 09:41:45,wallstreetbets,"Sure but thats still an anecdotal opinion, theatres will always be around but my question is what is going to fundamentally change that will convince people to go to the cinema any more often then they did before the pandemic. Unfortunately there is alot of competition for viewership, and its shifting to streaming, cinema is great and I love it, but you can't make someone watch the same movie 2 or 3 times more, and that is the AMCs core business model."

And here's where we are **(LOSERS IN BOLD;** *N/A, draws, or otherwise flat trades in italics)***:**

&#x200B;

1. **$CLNE:  This one got ugly.  Real ugly.  Volume completely dried up, which gave the shorts free rein to walk it down into oblivion all week.  They had an earnings call on Thursday, which was actually quite good (missed on top line EPS, but beat on revenue, upgraded forward guidance, and opened up more about the 1.5bln $AMZN contract, which sounds better and better the more I hear about it.  It actually traded up for a while this morning, but then just got absolutely assaulted the rest of the day because everybody was sitting it out.  I've averaged down - hard - on this one at this stage to make sure that I'm always within a day or two's striking distance of at least breaking even on the June calls.  I have started buying September calls at the same 13 strike.  I also started buying up more shares at $8.85 this afternoon.  I love a sale.   I'm going to re-evaluate how I feel about the June calls in the coming week.  Given that this stock has had 6 red days out of 7, any moves I make right now would be reactionary.  Further, one interesting thing I noticed was that, in the last 5 or 10 minutes or so, other whale buyers showed up HARD at the $8.79 price.  For a stock who's order book all day was just a series of 3-digit and low 4-digit offers, to see 50,000 share bids show up tells me that the shorts who had been fucking this thing all week were covering AND the buyers were coming back in (probably the same assholes who shorted it).**
2. *$MA:  I'm still yet to open a position here.  I just haven't liked the price action, and the charts have been very choppy.  If you've played it, let me know how it worked out for you.  Looking back at the weekly, I see some openings NOW, but they weren't real clear in the moment.*
3. $BABA:  I took the opportunity at 226 to finish filling out my call position as referenced in the last solo stock DD.  I know I said in that DD it was impossible to screw up, but apparently I underestimated the internet some, because I've had people messaging me saying they bought in at 234 and are down and ""feeling pain"", when I explicitly said not to buy at those levels.  It's interesting to me that the Chinese stocks, which are universally accepted to be underpriced, are moving in sympathy with domestic growth stocks.  That's broken.
4. **$BE:  Bought more August 31's on Thursday when it was at the bottom.  Sub-$20 was too good of an equity price to pass up.  I really liked the price movement on it yesterday and today.  Their earnings call was SPECTACULAR, and their leadership said all the right things.  I feel really good about this one to finally start moving independently of the rest of the green energy sector. Loser for right now, but I'm not getting shaken out**
5. $CAT:  Those July 230's were made of latinum.  Closed out today for fat profits.  I consider this trade over until $CAT comes back down into the 220's.
6. $EXPE:  Bought in yesterday morning.  Closed my position at about 2 pm EST today.  I sat on this trade a little too long and left about $3 a share on the table, but profit is profit.  It was a very nice trade.  This trade is closed
7. *$AAPL:  I never actually got into my long position.  I closed my pre-existing short on Tuesday and have been eyeing an entry, but haven't found one I like yet.*
8. $ALGN:  In Tuesday @ 575-ish, out today at 600.  Trade is closed
9. $PSFE:  As discussed in last week's post, I ended up removing this because the apes started trying to meme stock it, and I replaced it with $CVS, which has made me enough tendies to spring for the top shelf lube for when I fuck.  The $CVS trade is still ongoing and a good one to eye an entry, IMO
10. $CVX:  Jumped in Monday, and I'm still in the trade.  I like the movement on this one.  Still a good trade to enter, IMO
11. **$ENPH:  I'm upside down on this one, largely because I've been unwilling to average down on it.  My bags aren't super heavy, but I do have some Samsonites right now.  Going to just store it away and let it marinate.  The price action is still downwards here, so if you're eyeing this one, let it come in further**
12. $TSCO:  The price action on this has been amazing.  I've actually been holding this for quite some time, so my entry is way in the rear view mirror.  But I love how smoothly it's run and feel it's still got a lot more room to till.
13. **$CAR:  This is another one I've been holding forever, and just don't want to create a taxable event on.  The price action has generally been flat, if you remove the fact they had earnings this week, and we all know what earnings means in this market.  I still like this one for a buy and hold**
14. $KMI:  We don't talk about $KMI.  But if you're interested, maybe go look at a chart, because it'll make you wet
15. **$BB:  I haven't done anything with this, and honestly, couldn't even tell you how it's performed.  Probably poorly.**

&#x200B;

# The shorts:

1. $TSLA:  I jumped in at $712.11.  Everybody in the daily told me I hated money.  I got out at 666, even though I was swearing up and down it was going to 650.  The price action just looked like it was turning, so I took tendies.  Then it went to 650 like I thought it would.  Could have done it better, but profit is profit.  I'm eyeing a re-entry to the short side on this one.  I'm thinking 685-690 I'll likely re-establish.  Related note:  Think I've finally got a grasp on this one - 6 successful trades in a row, and I was even able to call the closing bell price within less than a dollar this morning.  This stock is finally starting to play by the rules.
2. $UPST:  My most reliable short  I'm twenty-some dollars a share in the green already and still holding.
3. $TWTR:  It's been SUUUUUPER choppy this week.  I got out at 52.80 for a nice gain, but I've hated the price action.  Staying away from here on out
4. *$CLOV:  Never had a good opportunity to play it.  Still watching*
5. $SPCE:  Death, taxes, and $SPCE tanking.  Still holding for a modest gain with stop losses in place.  Been pretty flat.  Probably still a good short if you can time it.
6. $PTON:  God bless that Shortbus All-Star kid who got eaten by the treadmill.  Lambo squad trade.  Closed out, and consider the trade done unless I see it in the mid 90's again
7. *$TSM:  Never entered.  I thought I had a price target in mind, but I wussed out at the last moment.  Doesn't matter, Theta Semi living up to its name*
8. $BLNK:  30% gain.  I'll look for re-entry at 35.
9. **$GS:  Defying the odds.  Trimmed my position to hedge losses, but this one isn't working out so far. Will look for weakness to re-establish in full**
10. $PINS:  Closed half my position at 60 for a nice gain.  Holding the other half with tight stop losses, but I'm optimistic it's got further to fall
11. *$BMBL:  I missed it.  Kicking myself for it, too.  I knew it was gonna fall.  Not sure how much downside is left*
12. $EGHT:  Oh the sweet sound of an equity dying.  This one is printing for me hard, and I think it's still got another 3-4 dollars to the downside in it
13. $MDB:  See $EGHT.  Exact same story
14. $PCG:  Riding it down like a submissive whore.  I'll probably run this one the entire month.  Printing nicely, still plenty of room to drop
15. $DASH:  LAMBO SQUAD!  Oh man, this one has been magnificent.  And it's still got downside.  Fair value IMO is 80.  It'll never hit it, but I think 110 is entirely doable.
16. $GRUB:  Reliable gainer to the downside, but not as nice as $DASH.  Still holding.
17. $WORK:  Quietly dropped on no news.  Just shows how broken the market is, because the buyout price is baked in.  I was following this so I could see news to potentially short $CRM, but none came.  $CRM, however, fell nicely on the week, but I wasn't there to catch it.  Trade is likely running out of breath
18. *$CAN  Never entered it, which is sad because it could have been a good gainer.  I'll rectify that mistake on some upwards momentum*
19. $BYND:  Yacht squad.  What an amazing loser.  Still holding.  I want to see 95
20. $AFRM:  I love the concept, but I hate the business model.  This one has been a great gainer for me, but I want to see 44.  Still room to drop
21. $COUR:  Inadvertent earnings play.  Didn't realize t hey were reporting this week.  Happy accidents.  2 bagger, excellent play.  I covered this afternoon.  I think there's probably still another 10% to the downside possible, but I actually like the model and don't want to tempt fate.  This trade is closed to me.
22. *$HEP:  Got in and got out at dead even.  Thought I had a good entry but then things got choppy and weird.  Removed it from my watch list.  This trade is dead to me with a draw.*
23. *$CSCO:  never entered.  Which is good, because it's run up.  I'm eyeing an entry*
24. $PLNT:  Another great winner.  I wanna see another 4 dollars to the downside  Trade still live
25. $QS:  Patently obvious this was gonna drop like a rock.  Ask me when it's at $10 and I'll probably still be shorting it
26. *$WMT:  I got cute and walked into a flat trade.  Will exit next week, win lose or draw.*
27. **$ADT:  Took the L here.  Entered at $9.27, got scared off this afternoon with a small loss.  They treated me like Ned Beatty in Deliverance.  Took it off my watch list, trade is dead to me just like that dude who wanted to fuck a pig.**
28. *$TW, $RTX, $COF, $NOC, $ADM, $AAL, $WHR, $LUMN, didn't enter any of these.  $COF, $AAL and $WHR are the only ones I'm even still tracking.  The others are dead to me*

&#x200B;

Wild card:  Scalped some nice puts on Brooklyn Pharm.  But any idiot could have done that.

Unexpected long:  Entered into $ON again with 1500 October 45c's and 300 1/22 45c's.  The price was just too good.

**Record after 1 week:**

&#x200B;

* *Longs:  8-5-2 (given the week that just happened, I'll take it)*
* *Shorts:  18-2-15:  Most of the draws are simply because I never entered the trades.  Take out the trades where I never expended powder and it's 18-2-2.*

# 

# Overall (played trades):  26-7-2

# Advanced Metric - New trades that don't involve positions I've had open at least 3 months:  26-3-2

So....how'd you do?  Let's hear it."
2021-05-08 03:19:49,wallstreetbets,"I’m new to trading so I only do stocks. Maybe I’m ready for options in a year or so.

$CLNE sitting at 200 @ 11.9, down 26%. Bought initially at 15.7 on 16th of March so I’ve been using the dips to average down. I’m look to buy ~70 more monday if it looks right.

$BE sitting at 80 @ 25, down 7.3%. Bought initially at 27,8 on the 27th of April. I averaged down on the 5th of May, but didn’t manage to buy the bottom unfortunately. Don’t think I’ll buy more before I feel I have CLNE under control.

I honestly feel ok about these trades. Only wish I had more powder to average down.


Thanks for you work. I really appreciate it. The updates on CLNE and  BE are keeping me sane in a market that is really hard to understand for a newb like me."
2021-05-07 20:35:23,wallstreetbets,"@u/Nrdrage I follow your picks for ideas. First one I shadowed you on was $ISRG. No hard feelings BTW. Anyhow:

BABA - 9/17 270C and 10/15 280C. Both down about 19% at the moment but this is a longer play so we'll see how it pays out. Not worried at the moment as I've seen red and green over the time I've held it.

AAPL - Totally forgot this was on your list but went long after the earning dip at $127 and sold a 6/18 120/125P credit spread. I think the long should be a good entry and I plan on doing the r/thetagang 50% profit move on the spread if this thing flatlines.

BB - I'm holding bags since January but it's a small portion of my portfolio so I'm going to pretend like it doesn't exist and check on it in  2023 or whenever we have flying cars.

CLOV - Couple weeks ago got in on a Thursday at 8 with a few thousand shares and got out the following Monday morning at 11 then watched it fall back to 9 that afternoon. Made me feel like a genius. Pure luck though.

PINS - got in long on an earnings play expecting a beat. Got beat by the fucking CEO saying sales were pulled forward. What a dick.

Keep it up brother! Also, love the snark as much as the picks.

Edit: just read your comments on GS in this post and remembered what you said previously (lol). I looked at the history and agreed with the DD but had a bad feeling considering the market currently defies the laws of physics and I feel like the calendar is off by a month or so. Can you talk about the short positions you had recently? I would love to analyze the trade for the ""sell in May and go away"" thing next year if that is a big bank thing anymore. Those bitches!"
2021-05-07 21:30:06,wallstreetbets,"Watching everyone here cry about red this week, I decided to sell off a 36% green stock so I could get more ammo for bargain hunting, which I enjoy almost as much as mixing metaphors.  I stayed out of entries given all the earnings reports coming in and general mayhem as noted in the chats until today.  Today I bought some $SU, $BB (I'm late to the party, so my avg cost is fine), $CLNE, and some options that looked (relatively cheap) for $BB Jan 22 and $CLOV May 21.  I listened in on the $CVE earnings call, and bought some after the price dropped on the (checks notes)...good news (?) for future increase.  $ENB has my attention because of the line 5 bi-national fiasco, but I'll wait on that due to politics.  (Winter will always be coming and houses will always need heating, in a place that hold more than half the national population, and oh, maybe a surprise election?)  My very first options expired worthless this afternoon, but that's okay, I'll survive the $30 tuition fee.   I'm looking at VIAC, BABA, and HUT 8 for next week, once my paycheck arrives.  After that I'll be loaded up to my annual tax-free limit, and I'll have to play within my portfolio."
2021-05-07 22:44:32,wallstreetbets,"been a buy & hold boomer for the longest time and decided to try something else at the worst possible moment... 

PLTR bought the biweekly calls when it dipped below 22... doubled down when it dipped low 20s... but when it hit 19s... i bailed and took the 45% loss

CLNE bought shares at 11.18... doubled down at 9.8... was about to double down again at 8.9 but missed the bell... currently down 16%

CLNE June calls... down 75%... still a long way from June and thought about doubling down with June calls today since they were <$0.20 or perhaps at a lower strike.. but didn't execute.. hope i don't regret come monday

BABA shares down 2.5%

BB shares down 1.4%

&#x200B;

PLTR / CLNE were my first try at options and while I knew there was volatility, i didn't realize it would be this crazy... i'm not sure if it's my broker (not in US), but whenever I set limit sells of my options, it could never sell for what I want, even though as I refresh last sell prices, I keep seeing the last prices that meet or exceed my limit... in the end i just sold at market. 

Being burned so bad at my first hand at options, might slow down a bit while I watch for entry with the BABA calls... maybe go for lower strikes to be safe. i definitely also don't have the same ability to be as agile with the scalping.... plus my broker has insane fees for options (almost $10 per option trade + $1 per contract)

I was worried about trying to shorting so went with the options first.. but with these first week results, thinking if i should give it a go on the short side next week or i missed the boat on those (DASH/TSLA/BYND) since my timing is usually horrid"
2021-05-08 01:08:26,wallstreetbets,"Just started following you this last week.  I was doing great last week and then got kicked in the teeth on Shop, Zm, Amzn etc.  Down about 23%.

Added some Clne positions will add more next week if it looks like it has found a bottom but down 50% on Sept $12s.

Jumped into Pltr $22C for May 14th and 21st.  Bleeding.  I should have put stoplosses on it but thought it would go up more the next day.  Saw the exit at about 15% gain but let it ride next day. Lesson learned, always stoploss to secure profit, minimize loss. Hoping for a solid Monday or I will have to cut losses.

Already been in Baba for a while running PMCC, going to expand position and be careful of how far otm the CC are in case it runs.

Same with Aapl.

Added some CAT today.  Going to set stoploss on Monday and see if it will run anymore.  Saw that you just exited. Even right now.

Added KMI, seems to be solid.  PMCC on this one because is seems to be a tortoise stock (slow and steady) with good gains already.

On the wrong side with Tsla, TSM, Pton, Twtr (after drop).  Looking to exit about where you want to short it. TSM seems to be a good PMCC stock because it just hangs around $115 to $122.

Planning to add ON Long and some shorts on PCG, Dash, Bynd, Afrm, Cisco, QS next week.

Also saw a comment earlier that ZM is a buy under $300 but I have been bleeding on it the last week just got out yesterday. Looks like it is in a downward trend down.  Also tech and market hates tech right now, any thoughts? Enter a long position with tight stoploss?"
2021-05-08 01:41:11,wallstreetbets,"BB I bought 800 on the massacre when it dropped below 8. Ended today at 8.48 and briefly hit 8.63. I know it's a long term play, but it's good to grab on sale. Thanks for the DD."
2021-05-07 22:45:20,wallstreetbets,"Went heavy into CLNE as I thought I was buying the dip but it kept going, like their story, their news/direction/position so I avg'd down. Been loving those 2 Sept Cs for KMI. BB I've avg'd down on so I'm down to $10 avg cost + Jan 12Cs. Was debating scattering across your long positions or just focusing on a couple that I knew/had time to do more research on, chose the latter. 

&#x200B;

Ironically I went light on KMI as I was expecting it to dip because it'd been on such a tear already and went heavy into CLNE expecting it to to rebound because it had been beaten down so fast so I put much more into the former instead of the latter.

&#x200B;

Followed your May 14 22Cs for PLTR that you recommended in the Daily thread but got underwater fast, holding a couple still in hopes of some earnings to help me break even."
2021-05-07 22:53:44,wallstreetbets,"Me transferring funds to buy the esoteric price drop that is CLNE: Surely it can't fall below 9! 

We all know what happened next. 

My position is small since I don't even have the dough to qualify for options, but still. I'm ready to nut when it bounces."

2021-05-08 16:13:02,wallstreetbets,"CLNE at current stock price is a must own. Opened a position, 2000 @ $9 on Friday. Too good to pas up."
2021-05-08 18:35:17,wallstreetbets,"Bought into CLNE on 4/26 and have been averaging down throughout this last week

Had CLOV 5/21 9P that I got on the last spike on 4/28. Finished closing them on Tuesday for a 60% profit. I made money on the way up on that play too.

Got a 3 bagger on LPX may 65c. Sold it at open Wednesday when I saw how much it jumped after hours, bought back in Thursday with some Aug 80c’s, and sold half Friday because I’m thinking it might drop again Monday.

I’m up 300% on MOS right now, got in on Tuesday since I got chewed out at work Monday and didn’t look at stocks at all. Probably going to jump out of it next week sometime and then hop back in at a lower price again. MOS and LPX are the two stocks I’m working with to learn how to play up and down, although I’m not buying puts for them.

MVIS I played on the way up (although I got in late) and on the way down. Got a two bagger on calls and a 30% profit on the way down that I closed on Thursday.

Sold my NKLA put yesterday basically breaking even.

Also bought WY on Thursday.

Surprisingly, despite my CLNE position being down 55%, I made it out on the week about even. I’m also looking to get into ON if I find something I want to close out on this week."

I added more BYND today, we shall see if I’m shining the deck on your Yacht or if I get my own dingy.

As for MA that is the number one long in my portfolio and has been for a long time. It can’t lose, I’m sure you are aware they will be raising fees as soon as they can, it prints money. I can’t imagine it will fall much below $370 so now is as good a time as any."

2021-05-08 06:26:32,wallstreetbets,"Serious question why short on PCG?

I'm all in on oil and gas plays. CLNE burned me big time though I followed your previous DD on that one..

I like the KMI position but I played ET instead 5/14c $9....beat earnings hands down and sales as well. Only downside I see is that it benefited greatly from the Texas freeze so it could be a one time event but oil prices keep on going up it still has potential it hit $11-$15 analyst PT of $19.

I have some rig 5/21c $4 that just woke up this week...going to roll them into June.

And last but not least HAL....its been a life saver. Had 5/7 $20 calls that bailed me out this week from dumbass earnings plays and then I scalped some 5/21c $22.50 on Thursday morning and it already up 150%."

- Avg. down on BE calls, initial purchase was at $27 before it dumped on 4/29. Added shares around $22 and $19 - Down about 11% overall still because the calls are down 30%
- Added CLNE shares avg cost $9.38

These positions make up a little under 10% of my account so its nothing crazy. The other 90% is across steel stocks so my port is up 100%+ YTD, 30% this week alone. I trimmed steel slightly to buy into these."

2021-05-08 01:40:28,wallstreetbets,"I'm already out.  Matter of fact, $PLTR has been beaten down so unreasonably badly that I'm actually legitimately thinking of opening an honest-to-god long position and not just a channel scalp."
2021-05-08 02:08:19,wallstreetbets,"So, for me, when I'm looking at a stock, the first thing I look at is the story.  I want to invest in companies that I think are game changers (or, as some say, ""innovators"", or as SF hipsters say, ""disruptors"").  I want organizations that are doing something that nobody (or almost nobody) else is doing.   This is why I key into outlier companies in a sector like $NVTA, $CLNE, $BE, etc.   And I want to believe that they can execute that vision.  Which is why I don't fuck with companies like $QS or $FCEL or $NKLA, because I don't think they can ever actually make something.  Or at the very least, I want a company who's story has a lot of tailwinds.  I want to make sure the company is focused on being a company, not virtue signaling social causes that are just distractions.  This is also where I decide if the market agrees with me.  It doesn't matter if I'm right, if the market disagrees with me, the market is right where it counts (money).

&#x200B;

The second thing I do is look at Travelcenters of America.  I start with a daily and expand it out 6 months (used to be a year, but Covid Wall Street isn't useful data), then I go to a 10 minute chart, and I re-chart.  Then I take it down to a 4 and break it into segments.  Finally, I break 2 weeks down into 2 minute charts to confirm.

&#x200B;

THEN I look at the fundamentals.  I don't pay a lot of attention to traditional things like PE ratios, I don't go digging for ""catalysts"" or ""reasons"" why a stock increased in price.  Nobody ever looks for a reason why something dropped, so it always pisses me off when they ask why it will go up after a drop.  I do want to see cash on hand.  I want to see what the debt looks like.  I do care about multiples to a point.   If sentiment is illogically insane ($TSLA) I'll overlook it even if I dislike the company, but if it's too high ($UPST) I'll key in on it as a short play, even if I like the company.  I want to see if they have a dilution problem or an activist investor fucking things up.  I want to see their institutional hold percentage.  I want to see their customer base.

&#x200B;

If they pass all that, then I go into my wildcard stuff t hat doesn't matter to most people.  For one, I have a strict ""no asshole"" policy.  For example, my VC was an early investor into $SQ and I made the decision to liquidate us out of that when the stock was all the way down in the 40's, even though I knew it was going to go much further, simply because Jack Dorsey was the 2nd most vile person I've met in executive management, and I wanted nothing to do with him.  This is also why I'll only ever short $TWTR.  I would never do business with or invest in any company associated with Vlad, or Chamath, etc.  Then I want to see what analysts are covering the company, and I want to make sure these people aren't especially problematic (part of $CLNE's problem is I overlooked that Pavel from RJ was covering them).

&#x200B;

From there it's just a question of studying the charts, looking at volume and order flows, trying to understand how the machines trade the equity and how they behave, etc.  This is very much an art form and not really something I can make a runbook for.  It's very intuitive.  All this is also why I'm so good at catching bottoms, say buy into pain, and completely disregard the adage about not trying to catch a falling knife.  Once you build that intuition, falling knives become good things because you can just instinctively see at a glance where to grab it from.  It's the single greatest skill a trader can have."
2021-05-07 23:39:27,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I just type in 3 random letters on my keyboard and buy calls on whatever ticker than happens to be."
2021-05-08 01:50:04,wallstreetbets,"It's not so much financial sector in general.  I specifically keyed in on $GS because, historically, they're the underperformer in May.  This is due to it being common knowledge that most of their clientele is old money Northeast coast types that have their wealth managers liquidate their portfolios for a few months while they go to their summer home in Cape Cod.  $GS doesn't have that beer and Cheetos clientele that UBS or BoA have, who leave their money active all year."
2021-05-07 21:43:11,wallstreetbets,Just got added as an “official user” of the sub in your name that will not be named. Fucks.
2021-05-08 01:35:44,wallstreetbets,"There are a number of things, in my opinion

&#x200B;

First, completely disregard ""investor concerns about bond yields"" or ""fears about rate hikes"".  Those are red herrings.  For one, investors don't give a shit about bond yields (and Millennials/zoomers are too young to know this, but back when I first started angel investing near the turn of the century, bond yields were over 6%.  Contrarians will point out multiples were a lot lower back then, but the two aren't handcuffed).  For another, JPOW has been very adamant about the rate scheduling.  Any talk otherwise is just FUD and attempting to create a narrative to mask an activity.

&#x200B;

Second, President Harris's sabre rattling about making cap gains taxes over half of your profits in a lot of states, doing away with the 1031 real estate loophole, increasing corporate taxes, etc. DO cause markets to flee growth and into value/divi stocks.  It doesn't matter that the odds of any of it happening are slim, beating that drum can shake a market.  But people decided that fucking with the market is better than mean Tweets, so here we are.

Third, and this is a big one, hedge funds are leveraged to the tits - they've gone full retard because the SEC has reverted back to a feckless, toothless oversight board that doesn't enforce anything.  Bill Hwang was not an anomaly  He's just the first notable one that had the right series of events come up to force liquidation.  IPM in Sweden had a similar leverage that went tits up, and Sunshine had a similar problem, but not a lot of assets so it wasn't notable.  And the way these hedge funds are ""hedging"" their extremely leveraged positions is to short the ever loving fuck out of the market to try and make money both directions.  Notice how all of this got really weird after Hwang made international news.  That's because hedge funds that are cheating right under the SEC's nose didn't want to suffer the same fate, so adopted the maximum pain strategy.

Third, and this is another big one, it's the lockdown and stimmies.  The K-shaped recovery is real.  A lot of people have a lot of extra powder laying around, and they've decided, by and large, to put it to work for them.  People got stimmies and immediately tossed it into their bullshit ""free"" trading app.  The markets have never had so many retail investors in it before.  Which means there have never been more suckers tossing money into the market that Wall Street quants and algo coders are told to take all the money from.  It took them a while to figure out how to deal with this massive influx of cash into the markets, and you saw them really on their heels for a coujple of months, but they've figured out the game now.  The system of checks and balances is completely off the rails right now.  It used to be, IB's and HF's would shear the retail investors in an effort to slowly bleed them where possible, but not slaughter them so that they can't be sheared ever again.  Now there are so many people in the markets that they've just turned the machines to kill mode without any regard for how much damage their greed is causing or how much wealth they're just literally destroying (it's not even a transfer of wealth, per se, a lot of this money is just consumed into thin air).  These HFT's have been programmed to find any gaps in liquidity anywhere in the market and exploit them for maximum gain without any regard for the damage they do to other investors or even the underlying company.  This is why you're seeing completely illogical price action and movement lately.  It's the equivalent to a Vegas casino reprogramming all their slot machines to pay out 15% under the Nevada laws on payout floors because nobody will stop them.  The unmitigated greed is completely unrivaled right now, because these banks know the field won't be full of easy to kill food forever and if they don't do the killing, their competition will.  This is why tech stocks rallied today.  President Harris comes out and says more stimmy is needed.  So ""rotate into growth"" again to make it look affordable, get the rubes to line up and put their money in high flying stocks, then pull the rug and take their money all over again because of ""fears of inflation"" or ""concerns about re-opening"" or whatever other bullshit reason they can come up with.

&#x200B;

The solution to this last one, of course, is to both require IB's and HF's to report their short positions daily much like Cathie sends out her mailers about what she bought and to also implement a tax on HFT's based on how many trades they perform to make it unprofitable to literally destroy value a fraction of a penny at a time, but of course nobody in Washington is talking about that because their overlords don't like it.  So, this is an actual casino, and the roulette wheel is rigged.  Either accept that or don't play.

&#x200B;

One good thing is, since the machines control the markets (it's not ""investors""), that means they're operating based on a program, and you can sometimes find patterns in those programs to exploit them.  People keep asking me how it is I found out about the JPOW diversity $SPY trick...it's simple, machines that are leveraging AI and trained to key in on certain words operate according to their program, and a pattern was detectable if you had a keen eye to see how they were programmed.  It's also how come I can so frequently pull off what I refer to as a parlor trick and call a stock's EOD strike within a few cents so long as the movement is organic (TSLA) and not obviously manipulated outside the bounds of a pattern (CLNE).  People ask me all the time how I do it, and the answer is simply I can sometimes see enough of a pattern to get an idea how the machines are coded.  It's not magic, it's just understanding systems."

2021-05-08 04:50:33,wallstreetbets,"Firstly thanks for the lengthy reply, much appricated! It's really useful to get the insight. 

I might get murdered for this comment but I thought MVIS was a game changer and real innovator in that sense with their products and was drawn in by the DD on the MVIS sub. I work in automotive so understand what kind of benifits their lidar will make to autonomous driving so it resonated with me. The thing I didn't really consider for myself was the overall picture of their finicials and other factors you've mentioned above. I had a brief look and they weren't great at all but I suppose I was blinded by the DD and confirmation bias.

Luckily I unwound the majority of my position on the way down from the last run up and got my original investment back. It could have been a very painful loss if I didn't see one of you comments about a car costing more than their profits 😂 I think that was the eye opening moment! 

Suppose what I'm trying to say is that if I had some of your other points in my original analysis and if I hadn't been so niave with it in the first place I could have avoided the risk of blowing up my account. Going forward those points will help with any future trades so thankyou for that. 

Having first hand experience of meeting some of the management of these companies must be so useful to see what the companies culture and motivators are like from the top down. I wouldn't have even considered looking at the type of analysists covering companies before investing too as a bad egg could spoil any analysis that comes out. 

I'm interested in who you think is above Jack Dorsey on that list of vile people in management. I can guarantee you knowing that my old team leader Emma from working in a bar at uni is at the top of my list isn't very helpful 😂

Why would fleeing growth and into value hedge against cap gains? 

Finally, you made another comment about your process for finding a stock etc. Surely all of that is irrelevant for the foreseeable future? i.e. you might not like NKLA or QS but if there's a discernable pattern then there's money to be made on the way up and the way down?"

2021-05-08 12:45:56,wallstreetbets,"I'm not shy about it:  It's Bezos.  Mackenzie was literally the only thing helping him maintain that last shred of humanity that he had, and he fucked that up, too (suffice to say, she got full custody of our friendship in the divorce, because it was one of those splits where even the friends got divvied up).  You always had to keep one eye on the dude, because it was obvious he would sell you upriver and screw you out of millions of dollars if it meant he'd profit 10 cents.

&#x200B;

What I look at really depends on what type of trade it is.  If I'm intraday scalping, a short frame MacD is my go-to.  You'll see a lot of Youtubers kind of shit on it or people here say it's worthless because it's a reactive indicator, but it's the best bias confirmation tool out there (in other words, all my other indicators that are forward facing say this thing is going to happen, Mac is showing that it's building to exactly that).  The only ""shapes"" I put faith in are wedges, triangles, and head and shoulders.  Cup and handle is pure bullshit, flags oftentimes fail, etc.  I'll still look for the flags, but only if I'm looking for one last piece of confirmation to a theory where I already have a few pieces.  I've also got some homebrewed oscillators I've created or been given over the years, but those aren't going to be helpful for you.

&#x200B;

In short, I want to see smooth patterns that will give me at least 70% conviction a breakout or directional move will happen."

&#x200B;

That said, I haven't held $RKT since I FINALLY got assigned the week after they announced that special dividend.  I doubt I'll buy in at this price, only because the theta gang play of buying 50,000 shares and then selling 500 covered calls 2 dollars outside of the money against those every week is profitable, but boring."

I actually got my start as a network security SME way back in the day and, to this day, the vast majority of my money - both personally and professionally - is earned in the security and cloud spaces, I just never talk about them because there are potential legal issues if I'm not careful.

&#x200B;

That said, I'm not as ""in the know"" on most hardware companies as I used to be.  As recently as 4 years ago, I could tell you every detail about all of them, but these days we almost always advise our squidlings to avoid building out their own infrastructure and we instead just set them up in Azure or GCP so they don't have to fight for talent that is really rare and expensive."

My further out leaps, I'd really like to see 20 on the equity value.

&#x200B;

In terms of my shares, I never intended to have so many of them, and I try to unload them pieces at a time during the day in such a way that it doesnt' disrupt price action.  But this week it went all out the window and I ended up buying a bunch more because it was so cheap.  At this stage, given the level of manipulation, even though this is WSB I'm gonna say that shares are the play with maybe a few options just to make it interesting."

2021-05-08 13:32:55,wallstreetbets,"I've averaged down to 68 cents per CLNE June 18 13C. I just haven't had the powder to put in. June 18's a little over a month out, but with the current price action, I've become more skeptical. There just haven't been any buyers (until close to AH yesterday). I know it was just last Monday, but holding during this price action makes me feel like one of the Gibbons expecting an increase on a stock that's already had its day. I know, completely different; 1.20 just feels like wishful thinking to me now that I've seen the call go to 0.18 lol. 

On another note, I made some puts on AAL, made 26%. Went in on TSLA puts around 687 (later than you, I'm not your wizard level) and got out at 671 and 668. Timed it bad, but made a profit nonetheless. 
Kicking myself for not getting in on UPST at 117, but with how down I am in CLNE right now, I'm trying to avoid trading on FOMO. 
Waited on entering BABA, got in at 226, only slightly red there, not concerned.
On the Shhhh stock, I'm also up ~31%. Don't want hedge fund WSB algos catching that. 

As always, thanks for your commentary and wisdom. I appreciate it. I'm in the red from CLNE's recent action and the ISRG play, but the TSLA play helped and if CLNE jumps back to ~11.40, I'll be good."
2021-05-08 16:39:37,wallstreetbets,"The reason the dicks like Dorsey, Bezos, Andrew Wilson and Paul Ricci stick out so much is because most leaders are, at their core, generally square deal types.  Like, after about 20 names, I start having to really think about shady leaders I've worked with, but I can list good dudes all day long.

&#x200B;

My favorite types to work with are engineers who really have no business being in charge of a company, because engineers make terrible executives - but they're usually really honest.  Nir Zuk comes immediately to mind.  Just an absolutely brilliant mind and I was thrilled to be able to get early VC into $PANW, and part of that was because I knew he realized he was going to have to cede control of the company to somebody else if he wanted it to be successful.  Those type of guys who are just whip smart and passionate about what it is they've created are almost always good people to put on your train."
2021-05-08 16:35:32,wallstreetbets,I don't know Zuck and Musk is fine once you realize you're dealing with somebody that has a terrible case of AssBurgers and adjust your approach accordingly.
2021-05-08 14:43:51,wallstreetbets,"Not in a position to offer financial advice ofc. But I would feel comfortable with both positions as long as those are in shares. Long dated call options is ok also as long as you are comfortable with the risk (ie there’s higher risk that you’ll lose all the money but for a much greater return).

BABA is vastly undervalued and a money making machine - the political risk is overdone I feel as the CCP, for all their faults, are actually very rational and won’t go about killing their golden goose all of a sudden. 

CLNE has a raft of good news but as suggested by Nrdrage has been kept artificially down. They are otherwise in a strong position to capture all those green initiatives.

Relax and ride it out."

20ish by September
11.40 by June (though this is being re-evaluated this week based on action)

Inferred from previous posts:
Near term is too hard to tell because of the whales pushing it down hard.  It should be at least 13.50 because of the Amazon warrants.  June is still 41 days away, so it’s possible to get some retrace, that’s why 11.40 is still on the table."

2021-05-08 00:33:24,wallstreetbets,Dude was a paperhanded bitch. That’s why no one gives a fuck about him. It’s there in the post title.
2021-05-08 15:27:39,wallstreetbets,"This is from the World Cycling Championship which was in the UK. The reason why no one stopped is because you have to stop and be serviced on the left side of the road, in the UK."
2021-05-08 07:16:44,wallstreetbets,Little bitch can’t make money on stocks
2021-05-07 22:38:29,wallstreetbets,Only his team can stop though right?
2021-05-07 22:39:51,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-07 22:38:53,wallstreetbets,Oh wow they killed him for that?  That’s wild
2021-05-07 20:36:47,wallstreetbets,Go help him.  Apparently he is still there
2021-05-08 01:50:18,wallstreetbets,real mvp
2021-05-08 06:39:07,wallstreetbets,It's a bunch of cheating drug addicts on a bike. Aren't you expecting a bit much?
2021-05-07 20:48:26,wallstreetbets,"Fucked his bike up and no one helped fix it, there was even cars that weren’t apart of any particular team and was out there to help anybody who needed it and they still drove past him. It’s sad man"
2021-05-08 07:52:34,wallstreetbets,shut up dork
2021-05-08 08:12:00,wallstreetbets,"That’s the whole point, to make you feel for those who have been through stressful times

Nevertheless the meme has absolutely nothing to do with the context of the original video"
2021-05-07 20:49:58,wallstreetbets,Deserve all the down votes you do
2021-05-07 21:32:11,wallstreetbets,Twat
2021-05-08 00:38:20,wallstreetbets,What’s bad about cyclists what????
2021-05-07 21:18:59,wallstreetbets,We don’t want to hear about your cock and ball torture accident...
2021-05-08 02:00:33,wallstreetbets,"Dude, the guy filming doesn't have the knowledge, tools, materials or job description to service racers' bikes. He's literally hired to film the sporting event and can't just stop doing his job to magically help. How insane would it be if a person filming a sporting event was expected to drop their camera and start interfering with the event?

Even if he did, what is he going to do that the cyclist couldn't already do? The cyclist knows way more about his own bike than a professional videographer does. Repairing tire tubes isn't really their speciality."
2021-05-08 01:57:24,wallstreetbets,"I seriously doubt the camera guy, who was likely nowhere near him because of zoom, had spare tyres. Because you know, it’s a televised competition and the camera guy can’t just leave"
2021-05-08 07:48:18,wallstreetbets,I remember one year I was watching the superbowl.  A referee had a heart attack and lost consciousness... boy I thought the game was over.  Then some guy selling hot dogs jumped on the field and resuscitated him.  Afterwards he had to go back to selling hot dogs and Bill Belichick was kind enough to fill in for the referee.
2021-05-08 01:55:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I hate seeing that clip of the guy recording also waving two new wheels at him while laughing. Breaks my heart every time."
2021-05-08 17:50:09,wallstreetbets,Why don’t u help the guy u holy mother bitch.
2021-05-08 01:02:00,wallstreetbets,"So those are the support vehicles for the other teams, they'll stop for someone on their team."
2021-05-08 00:58:00,wallstreetbets,Just 1300?… wimp.
2021-05-07 22:42:56,wallstreetbets,The commentators were saying some of the cars were neutral service and should have stopped
2021-05-08 01:38:52,wallstreetbets,"Fuckin Melvins, the lot of ‘em."
2021-05-08 10:41:30,wallstreetbets,Too many humans without a heart 😔 sure there were no Redditors!
2021-05-08 02:38:25,wallstreetbets,"They had a car but it was positioned way down, far from the lead group."
2021-05-08 13:27:26,wallstreetbets,"Ok then, this makes sense. Thanks!

Is it common for others to stop despite this rule, or is the car who could stop not marked any differently, so he wouldn’t really know which one it is?This guy just really seems like he expected one of them to stop."
2021-05-08 15:14:26,wallstreetbets,If you’re distracted by a fellow athlete getting a tire changed then you should be against the rules.
2021-05-08 15:56:01,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, thanks! This explains it perfectly."
2021-05-08 02:11:06,wallstreetbets,"If one of those cars was the Canadian car they better have stopped or I'm fucking disappointed.

&#x200B;

You American's can call it 'poor team management' That looks like a long line of douche canoes to me. You got a top tier athlete here, getting TKO'd because a bunch of incosiderates are all playing the competition like their dicks, where every half an inch counts."
2021-05-07 22:48:27,wallstreetbets,"There's usually a neutral service car as well, he must have missed it. I forget exactly what happened."
2021-05-08 01:43:09,wallstreetbets,"Technically?  Yes. But, that rule isn't always strictly enforced at lower levels. 

Cycling has so many rules there is no possible way to enforce them all, or even enforce them consistently."
2021-05-07 23:43:21,wallstreetbets,You know the sub is dead when this comment is disapproved of.
2021-05-08 02:23:48,wallstreetbets,This clearly wasn’t well liked but I had a good chuckle.
2021-05-07 23:55:21,wallstreetbets,Done sucking cook on 4chan?
2021-05-07 23:11:54,wallstreetbets,"Lol no no, they just decided the other riders on the team were more important, 

They usually have multiple riders to a team based on which event type it is. I’m not familiar with what event this clip is of, but some others in the comments may be. But they hosed him in favor of supporting the other teammates"
2021-05-07 23:36:06,wallstreetbets,Buahhahahahahhahahhaah stop it! Almost shat myself from laughing so hard.
2021-05-07 21:53:32,wallstreetbets,I thought the neutral cars didn't have his specific wheel or something like that
2021-05-07 21:28:38,wallstreetbets,Sorry one ball.  I should be more sensitive towards others semi pussies.  Noted.
2021-05-08 16:46:52,wallstreetbets,"I’d expect the cyclist to be able to fix his bike before some random camera man, but you’re right, many times a bike breaks like this it’s not going to be an easy repair. Likely needs a chain or some other part to get it working again."
2021-05-08 01:29:54,wallstreetbets,"If I remember the story right, this was a kid ( <23yo) in an elite international field, in the lead group near the end of the race. Then gets a flat with NO race support. Basically, his national squad didn't think enough of the kid to put a car in the race, or ask another car to help out. I'd cry too. 

Of course,  I could be remembering  it all wrong."
2021-05-08 00:36:03,wallstreetbets,Those commentators also say the SEC is on retail's side
2021-05-08 14:24:52,wallstreetbets,Like when Team Canada’s coach at the winter olympics helped that other athlete fix their skies and keep racing. If you YouTube that it should pop up
2021-05-08 03:38:23,wallstreetbets,They think no one in their team gonna be in lead group
2021-05-08 15:59:30,wallstreetbets,It's more so like if they block the road or something and the other athlete could have a harder time passing by /fall off. Obviously I don't make the rules
2021-05-08 07:50:19,wallstreetbets,I didn't realize this was an American race.  If you pull over to help the other team and then your team needs help what do you think happens?
2021-05-08 01:36:02,wallstreetbets,They drove past him.
2021-05-08 05:13:35,wallstreetbets,"no matter how much apes enjoy loss porn... at the end we are all (mostly) good people. What this man is going through is relatable to most retards here. You though you made it in life... and it all gets taken away bc of bad luck and the people who were supposed to back you up never show up.

I had a chuckle but you can see why it was downvoted."
2021-05-07 23:44:47,wallstreetbets,People saying the sub is dead is why the sub is dead.
2021-05-08 10:22:46,wallstreetbets,Yeah I honestly didn’t understand the reaction. Reddit can be a fickle bird sometimes
2021-05-07 23:56:54,wallstreetbets,Are people on this sub literally so retarded that jokes don’t fly?  I know membership has swelled but I didn’t think the current regime was literally retards. JFC
2021-05-08 01:44:53,wallstreetbets,Those weren’t his support team though. The competition wasn’t going to stop for him.
2021-05-07 21:57:03,wallstreetbets,how would they know what size tire he has without stopping? And don’t quote me on this but I think they all use the same tire size and same bike size and shit like that
2021-05-08 01:34:46,wallstreetbets,And the mutual (help anyone) car just passed him by - he was literally in the lead 3/4 bikes
2021-05-08 04:25:55,wallstreetbets,imagine getting betrayed by your team......
2021-05-08 06:40:08,wallstreetbets,It’s heartbreaking to watch.
2021-05-08 02:05:05,wallstreetbets,What race was this? I want to look it up
2021-05-08 09:18:11,wallstreetbets,Sure. But if you listen to the video with sound there are clearly neutral cars.
2021-05-08 03:37:19,wallstreetbets,"It is, government works for us the people"

2021-05-08 08:51:46,wallstreetbets,"It's certainly a bunch of 'American' Comments

When asked what he'd do if the Russians tried invading through the Arctic, a Canadian Northern Ranger said:

We treat our enemies better than you advocate treating ""opponents"" in a friendly competition."

2021-05-08 02:34:26,wallstreetbets,"Yes, his support team was with his other teammates (probably further in back), which is why no one stopped"
2021-05-07 22:24:17,wallstreetbets,Yeah my bad there were no neutral cars either apparently https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/09/cyclist-left-crying-when-support-car-fails-to-show
2021-05-07 22:02:20,wallstreetbets,I think you’re right on equipment. They don’t have to all use the same size but you’re also not going to be the only fuktard who is running smaller than the max limit or min limit whatever
2021-05-08 02:24:25,wallstreetbets,Was the mutual car punish?
2021-05-08 12:00:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's most cyclists who get on national squads.   In the U.S., the rider's parents pay the federation for the privilege of attending an event like that.  Meaning, you pay for coaches flights, logistics,hotels. A less obvious version of that happens. Typically you end up riding for the head coach's protégé ( it is a team sport in not obvious ways) who can't deliver the watts. 

Cycling is a great activity.   But, the organized competition side of it is not what mentally healthy people should be doing."
2021-05-08 02:42:17,wallstreetbets,"If I remember correctly, on a world championship race (U23? Atleast not with the full fledged pro's) back in 2019 (maybe 2018) but not that long ago"
2021-05-08 06:57:49,wallstreetbets,Lmao. See the kid in the vid? Don't be that kid.

2021-05-07 22:57:40,wallstreetbets,Really? The financials of the company are pretty divided. It's honestly a random gamble to even buy a single share tbh.
2021-05-08 01:17:59,wallstreetbets,"Right?! I actually started avoiding buying stocks I’ve seen mentioned in WSB because they ALWAYS tank same day

Hedge funds are dicks"

OP: let me show you a lil something called the WSB special"

2021-05-07 21:01:36,wallstreetbets,"I'm bullish longterm, like greater than a year, maybe even 2 years. I'm not sure where this goes short term, I don't see it going lower but I also don't see anything that will be driving it higher in the short term."

It's because he's not about the money, he cares enough the city, about making a difference, and about his employees. That's how you get loyal employees that give great customer experience. I don't want some run of the mill executives that make decisions quarter by quarter at the expense of employees/ customers so they can get their bonuses."

2021-05-07 21:51:32,wallstreetbets,"They don't hold mortgages, they bundle and sell them. They are also responsible lenders, didn't engage in subprime lending and still have the lowest delinquency rate of a large lender so their bundles actually sell at a premium. Not saying they wouldn't be affected by a bubble bursting in housing or whatever, but the reality is they're also more like to come out stronger and take market share in the event of a pop (like they did in 2008). If every lender had been like them, we never would have had a 2008. I personally think it's the big banks that are keeping the stock down so they don't grow and eat up their market share, either that or just big money fucking with anything WSB related."

I asked what’s the good news and they said “I won!”  and showed me their screen which was a bunch of stock tickers in the red.

2021-05-08 10:42:18,wallstreetbets,Right. But where did he get the money to YOLO?
2021-05-08 01:56:06,wallstreetbets,"Nah, lack of mortgage growth is what is most likely behind the flop. Which is due to higher rates and timber shortage etc."
2021-05-08 00:05:49,wallstreetbets,I am holding but I'll be keeping my eye out for other opportunities as well. I think it will take a while for RKT to grow their market share. I'll probably try to make some money elsewhere and put that towards RKT down the road.
2021-05-07 21:48:23,wallstreetbets,On TD. 15 is pretty prevalent on banks and insurance. Nonetheless good yolo friend. Again good luck it’s tough out there..
2021-05-08 18:35:37,wallstreetbets,"Just need to get onto the other side, everything I sold last week expired worthless. Rinse and repeat on Monday.  r/thetagang has showed me the way."
2021-05-07 20:16:00,wallstreetbets,"Bull Side - spitting off cash and a cheap P/E.  Using tech to speed up mortgage process and at the same time getting people into 'Rocket Ecosystem' which will include the full home buying process (finding agent, looking for houses, etc.)  personal/auto loans and other financial services.  They supposedly have a 90% retention rate.

Bear Side - interest rates are going up so the refi market will dry up eating into all their profits.  Making their cheap P/E and recent earnings spike a trap.  Making this a speculative buy on their 'Rocket Ecosystem' which is aspirational."
2021-05-07 20:49:12,wallstreetbets,It gapped down over the 19.90 and should take out the old low of 17.50 and then move up worst case. It has to come back up to close the gap at 23
2021-05-07 22:37:42,wallstreetbets,What's the pitch? Why should I buy?

2021-05-08 00:27:53,wallstreetbets,A lot of selling
2021-05-08 07:54:49,wallstreetbets,Before i spell out my own views i recommend you go look at their financials... and just look at all of them accross the board for the past 4 years and draw your own conclusion. And consider the current market climate and recent reports that have come out from the fed... on the stock market. If you buy you buy longterm... this aint no short term play. Short term plays were in 2020. When everything was stupid easy to make cash.

2021-05-08 18:13:34,wallstreetbets,He probably yoloed with a small amount and won big
2021-05-07 20:31:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I think what they're trying to do is grow market share, and with a 90% retention and high customer service rating, people who come in will most likely end up staying, like when they buy cars down the road or personal loans or something. I think it's a good strategy, but they're sacrificing margin to grow market share right now. The market obviously frowns upon that at this point, but I personally don't like companies that care more about the bottomline/ making the numbers look good as opposed to what's best for the company. That's how you get companies deciding that it's cheaper to get sued than to recall certain vehicles or something."
2021-05-07 20:16:11,wallstreetbets,"I have no clue to be honest with you, seems over sold at the moment, but it also seems there's some big money out there that wants to keep this stock down and who knows how long that can last. I personally can't tell if it's the big banks trying to force it down so they don't lose market share of the home/auto loans, or if it's just big money trying to fuck with Retail. If you have some better plays I'd love to hear them, but I suspect anything that retail is jumping into might just get pile-drived for the fuck of it eventually."

2021-05-08 15:16:15,wallstreetbets,"I obviously don't agree. That's just part of their strategy to grow market share, and with a 91% customer retention rate, once that market share grows they're likely to keep it."

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Weekly Market Recap for Gamblers and Degenerates - May 3rd to May 7th What’s poppin bull-gang, Flux here with your weekly recap of the markets! Earnings season continues, led by the many hyper growth stocks within the market. Like last week, there was a fat bag to be made, so I hope you all did well! This week is shorter than most, as not much has happened aside from companies reporting earnings. Let’s get into the news.

&nbsp;

- **On Monday, legendary investor Warren Buffet spoke at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting**, and it was honestly a banger. There was lot’s to be learned alongside the many cool topics which were discussed. My personal favourite was when they touched upon how most people were using the stock market as an exaggerated version of gambling. Although he;s not wrong, I wasn’t really in the mood to get personally attacked by a mf who looks like he’s on his deathbed. Regardless, if you would like a TLDR of the conference, you can find a link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx-OzwHpM9k) and if you’d like a video link, you can find one [here](https://www.investopedia.com/5-takeaways-from-the-2021-berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting-and-quarterly-earnings-report-5181664).

&nbsp;


- **Early in the week, Janet Yellen decided to play chicken with the market by suggesting that a rate increase may happen sooner, rather than later**. The markets swiftly tanked as a result, and in the end Janet Yellen ended up taking back what she said a day later. Obviously the economy is in shambles, but as long as nobody brings it up, we can keep the music playing, and the good times coming. Rookie mistake from Yellen, I’m sure it won’t happen again.

&nbsp;


- **On Tuesday, I ended up blowing up my account, which is pretty cool considering both Bill Gates and I managed to lose half of our net worth on the same day**. To the shock of many, after a long 27 years together, Bill and his wife Melinda decided to call it quits. Kudos to them for making it work for so long, I know the decision couldn't have been easy for either one of them. Both parties have asked for space and privacy during this time, so I plan on waiting till next week before sliding into the DMs.

&nbsp;


- **On Friday, the monthly job report was released, and it was kind of dogshit**. Nonfarm payrolls were expected to rise by roughly 1,000,000, but instead, we were met with a measly 266,000. We literally missed the projection by 75%. As a result of this absolute fucking disaster, the unemployment rate raised to 6%. I’m pretty sure there were more jobs being created when we were balls deep in the pandemic last March. Normally, shit news like this would be viewed as such, but in this clown market, this was viewed as bullish instead, so stocks rallied 1% on the day, creating new ATHs for all of the indices.

&nbsp;


- **As far as earnings are concerned, I’m too lazy to cover all 60 companies so I’m not going to**. That being said, almost every single company put up a *strong* beat aside from $RKT (lmao), indicating strength in the markets. Unfortunately, almost every single earnings beat was priced in, leading to most stocks tanking post earnings. This made it pretty easy to trade on earnings days, so if you somehow managed to lose money this week you should be ashamed of yourself. If you need some assistance playing earnings, I’ll likely post a master spreadsheet to both Reddit and Discord on Sunday to help you all out.

&nbsp;


- **Although dicey, the major indices closed the week out strong!** The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial average each made new respective all-time highs today despite the biggest miss in non-farm payrolls since at least 1998. Despite the insane mid-week chop brought on by Yellen, we’re still on pace for SPY to reach 450 during the summer, and 500 by EOY. Bullish as fuck. Both tech and growth stocks took an absolute beating this week, while energy, financials, and value stocks finally had the chance to soak up some gains. I hope next week is just as green, and just as choppy.


&nbsp;


All in all, that wraps up this week's recap! I hope you all had an awesome week, and made a fat stack of cash. If you would like a copy of these newspapers in advance, feel free to check out the Discord! I hope you all get to enjoy the nice weather and have a wonderful weekend! I’ll catch you all at the casino come Monday. Cheers 😎"
2021-05-07 20:52:58,wallstreetbets,"Some great insights! Thanks. Finally giving us autists some faith that this sub isn’t as broken as the market.
Sunday spreadsheet for earnings would be awesome. Because amazon took me for a ride."
2021-05-08 11:41:52,wallstreetbets,"Sir, did you just compare yourself to Bill Gates as if he was your peer? Well I guess maybe. It was reported that Melinda Gates did have a boyfriend on the side. Her Chinese translator or something."
2021-05-07 23:53:38,wallstreetbets,I'll keep you posted man! Thanks for reading.
2021-05-08 11:44:28,wallstreetbets,"Ah shit, you're onto me 😳"
2021-05-08 11:43:36,wallstreetbets,At least you got to sleep peacefully :)
2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"RKT = A moment of silence -_- *The lone trumpet plays*

Here is to all of those who had weeklies on RKT.

Sadly we have seen some of your posts and the hopes that friday would end up better.

It did not...

Sadly for the one that destroyed his account and posted about maxing out credit cards for the bet = may you rest in sweet sweet peace my child.

For real, I never thought RKT would dip below the lows of the last 3 years.  Wtf is going on?

Peace be upon you poor poor souls.

No $hang bets please, remember next week is a new week to lose money."
2021-05-07 21:36:39,wallstreetbets,Bro i literally got a debit spread for 22/22.5 expecting the “worst case” where it only goes to 23 and stays there. NEVER did i even imagine it would drop below 20
2021-05-08 10:31:33,wallstreetbets,"Tin foil hat: ON

So here's what I think happened. The options chain was heavily weighted in calls, and could have caused a gamma squeeze had RKT gone up after earnings. MM was having none of that, so price crashes, no gamma squeeze, everyone gets fucked except for MM.

This market is completely fraudulent."
2021-05-07 22:00:05,wallstreetbets,Woot I'm glad I sold all my RKT stock 2 weeks ago at a lose so I could buy the peak for MMED!

2021-05-08 09:17:00,wallstreetbets,I heard $ROPE will moon.
2021-05-07 20:54:44,wallstreetbets,"I bought 1 21c and 1 19p 3/14, I'll let you know when I'm a millionaire."
2021-05-07 22:33:04,wallstreetbets,"Low interest rates, companies smashing earnings and going down and a mortgage company with a huge market cap. It was a pretty unlikely bet."
2021-05-07 23:10:43,wallstreetbets,Even now it isn't a good price to buy
2021-05-07 23:41:53,wallstreetbets,This is only my opinion. But aren’t people overestimating the fact that everyone’s has bought their homes at low interest rates and underestimating the fact of a sudden interest hikes when people complain about taxes due all covid stuff?

2021-05-08 01:50:40,wallstreetbets,Sadboy but still gonna hold. Didn't think after months at $22/23 it could go any lower.
2021-05-08 03:32:23,wallstreetbets,Maybe some of you can try to make some of your money back on RKT using covered calls
2021-05-08 09:10:30,wallstreetbets,Lol 3 year low?!
2021-05-08 10:05:50,wallstreetbets,"Sorry for your losses guys. I’m still betting on real estate collapse and RKT doesn’t fit in that thesis.... but I WAS tempted a couple weeks ago.

Dust off and come back to the casino."
2021-05-08 10:45:19,wallstreetbets,It's what happens when a bunch of retards accidentally type RKT rather than GME in Robinhood =)
2021-05-08 11:58:17,wallstreetbets,Your supposed to invest in housing related stonks after the bubble pops not before.
2021-05-08 17:46:15,wallstreetbets,My kids gonna have to hold the bag for me
2021-05-07 21:38:20,wallstreetbets,"Bought RKT 22 5/7 calls on Tuesday. Sold them Wednesday morning and immediately bought 5/21 puts.


I'm happy :)"
2021-05-07 22:55:24,wallstreetbets,Seems like something about you guys flooding rocket call sellers with millions of dollars worth of premiums while they just keep shorting the stock.
2021-05-08 09:33:35,wallstreetbets,This makes me happy because half the people who jumped on the RKT train were bashing GME. Look who’s the bag holder now.
2021-05-08 01:47:43,wallstreetbets,I'm just glad I bought shares instead of calls. You only lose when you sell. 🧠
2021-05-08 05:44:32,wallstreetbets,Awe yes. I love never seeing my money! Buried with my riches haha
2021-05-07 22:56:02,wallstreetbets,You going to keep putting money into it forever too? Sounds like the opposite of what your original goal was.
2021-05-08 06:41:40,wallstreetbets,"Not giving advice here, but averaging down is a thing that I like."
2021-05-08 00:48:38,wallstreetbets,Raising interest rates like what? Near zero to 1%? It’ll be still super low compared to last years and decades and people will buy apartments as money worth absolutely nothing. Lost all the value with endless printing
2021-05-08 00:57:03,wallstreetbets,They don't make the moon rockets? Ah crap.
2021-05-07 21:58:59,wallstreetbets,or go low 18s.... lol

2021-05-07 21:38:53,wallstreetbets,Just clicked on the smiley face and it came up
2021-05-07 21:41:21,wallstreetbets,"You should be a politician, you can dodge a question better than queen Elizabeth dodges coffins."
2021-05-08 03:28:20,wallstreetbets,"I mean, the stock market is forward looking so maybe it's already hit bottom?  It IS at an all time low right now, but it did only go public in August so who knows.  I just don't see it going up until housing inventories rise (which is probably almost a year off because new construction takes time), and it  could be offset by interest rates going up (assuming they do because it's impossible for them to go down any more).  It's P/E ratio IS pretty damn low, but once their earnings go down these next couple quarters due to lack of new mortgages, the P/E ratio will go up.  I'm definitely not an expert on it (even though I do work in the mortgage industry)."
2021-05-08 10:27:00,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, what's it going to go up? 0.25% at worst? People are just on pins and needles right now, and I guess it's warranted."
2021-05-08 10:16:49,wallstreetbets,"I'm buying puts on next earnings, that's for fucking sure. I'm starting to think we are in a totally fraudulent market."
2021-05-07 22:02:23,wallstreetbets,Ikkk I literally thought this was easy money and was proud of myself for making a safe trade for once
2021-05-07 23:55:18,wallstreetbets,Im gonna make a meme out of you when GME moons

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"God Tier DD, Buy NOW & Get Rich Monday 
Sup apes 🦍. Here’s the the plays 🎰 that pay 🐄

$RKT - Everyone is building houses 🏠 in 2021 with premium lumbers 🪵 and everyone loves using TurboTax. That’s why you should invest in Quickbooks Mortgages 🧾. Plus their name is an emoji we like 🚀. Buy calls.

$MVIS - it’s a microchip 💾 company or uh...a laser 🔫 company. It’s really good. It’s been around for 20 years without making a profit so it’s sure to profit on year 21. Buy calls and shares and maybe puts too.

$ROOT - Insurance company that makes you install an app on your phone and raises your rates if you speed 🚗. Everyone likes driving slow 🚧, switching insurance providers 👨🏻‍💼, and learning new apps 📱. Switch to ROOT insurance, drive safe, save money, reinvest those dividents into ROOT.

$PTON - They make execise bikes 🚲 that require a monthly subscription 💳. Will continue to soar after gyms reopen. Only killed ☠️ one baby 👶🏻, which is a limitless resource and we can always make more. Massive product recalls are an opportunity to wow customers with premium service. Buy at any price under $200.

$CLOV - owned by benevolent billionaire 💰 Chana 🥘 Masala, Clover uses machine learning 🤖 to decide when it’s time for your parents to die ☠️. Chana even bought $GME once. Buy leaps! 6/18 $20c. 7/17 $25c. 8/19 $30c. 9/20 $40c. 10/31 $100c.

$ARKK - owned by Christian ✝️ MILF 🤵🏻‍♀️ Cathy “Gives Me” Wood 🪵 It’s an ETF that buys all the WSB tickers, cause Cathy is trying to impress us 🦍. If you want to diversify put your life’s savings into this one. Buy 6/18 $200c.

$PLTR - owned by a gay 🌈 Paypal vampire 🧛🏻‍♂️. They sell Palastinian 🇵🇸 address data to the IDF 🇮🇱 Palintir is Sauromon’s crystal ball 🔮, and Sauromon was the good guy in $LOTR. Too risky for calls because share price only goes down so buy shares, any price under $60 is good.

$TSLA - Owned by the other 🌈 Paypal guy, this company sells electric ⚡️ cars 🚙 at a loss 📉 and they just bought a ton of electric coins at -10% ATH. Run by the Smartest man on the planet. Buy $2000c. on Monday cause Elon on SNL is gonna print! 🖨

And of course, the big one,

$GME - a video game 🎮 pawnshop that will soon let you pawn boardgames 🎲 and computers 💻. It is exactly what Americans need in the 2020s. Buy $800c every month.

Make sure to NEVER take profit. Only sell on a loss. The point of the market isn’t to make money, it’s to impress a message board by losing a year’s salary in a screenshot 🤳🏻.

I would post positions but I am currently under investigation by the SEC and banned been from trading securities.

Media execs are reading these posts and trying to figure out a way to appeal to millennial investors much the same way Comedy Central and HBO invested in tv programming to make news and current events for the cool kid millennial viewers.  You may end up as the Jim Cramer of the Millennial Generation replacing “buy buy buy” sound bites that were funny in the early 90’s with clever investing meme’s and sarcastic investing advice.
2021-05-07 22:45:03,wallstreetbets,"I understand the POINT of the post and it is funny but I mean, arent almost all of these tickers wildly successful barring like a few that just recently IPOd? RKT/PLTR etc

I mean, Jesus Christ if you had bought NOTHING but these tickers a year ago? God damn....youd be rich as all good god damn fuck right now. 

The thing I dont understand though is why when these tickers are up thousands of percentages in a matter of a few months/years why people think they will ONLY go up from there? 

Things like RKT though...god damn that company is a fucking powerhouse with no debt and tremendous revenue thats only expanding from here. lol 

Let me reiterate that I DO get the joke and I DO find it funny its just that...you know....if you threw $10k into just these tickers 1 year ago youd have hundreds of thousands today if not more.

1 yr gains for 2020

RKT - didnt exist for a year - break even YTD

MVIS - 647%

ROOT - 33%-

PTON - 434%

CLOV - 48%-

ARKK - 148%

PLTR - 16%- 

TSLA - 743%

GME - 700%

2021-05-08 00:45:44,wallstreetbets,F*ck Israel !
2021-05-08 00:51:14,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the Pro tips man.

I’m all in on the gay PayPal vampire !!! 

Teens love vampires. 

Gay is the new black, so hot right now.

PayPal has that Blockbuster Video energy. Who doesn’t like being charged a percentage of your online sales having even the most trivial sale reported to the IRS and the fact that they can will and do freeze accounts with the account holder having exactly Zer0 recourse they’re just completely fcukt = more money for PayPal which = more money for me… I believe that’s how stocks and corporate entities work anyways.

And really when you think about it, who would you call if you needed a mass data collection of Palestinian addresses ? Israel I suppose but I dunno how realistic is that they’d even answer the phone and I don’t speak Druish or whatever it is they speak over there so …. this is a no brainer.

I’ll ask Tyrone, my wife’s boyfriend, one of them anyways 😐if maybe I can have access to some of my savings. It’ll have to wait for a bit though he just took the wife to Vegas and then they’re skipping off to Hawaii for a couple weeks.
Not a cheap trip lol but it’s cool he has my Amex so there’s no limit.

I’ve never actually been out of state. Grew up here always dreamed of traveling abroad with my beautiful wife and God bless his heart Tyrone is living that dream for me.

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little disappointed when I asked if I could maybe tag along and he didn’t respond he just spit on me and called me a CRACKA so I just went back out to the garage made my cot and got some sleep.

Working 3 jobs these days. Had no choice really Tyrone is really into precious metals. Gold chains gold bracelets gold watches lol nothing but the best.
Comes at a high price though so that’s why I grabbed the second job.

Then when he borrowed my Audi he accidentally got a little too tipsy and ended up … long story short high speed chase, Sheriffs, and when he ended up wrapping the car around a telephone pole he did the right thing and fled the scene.

Which is a good thing he could have gotten in a lot of trouble.

However, when the Sheriffs found and recovered the now totaled vehicle they found individually wrapped bags of crack cocaine. So naturally with the car being in my name and licensed to my name the Sheriffs came a knockin. 
Unbeknownst to me I guess the money I gave Tyrone to pay for my car insurance he mistakenly assumed the money was for a new pair of sneakers he had wanted so bummer on that aspect but on the plus side when I was arrested and charged with fleeing the scene of an accident / reckless driving / reckless endangerment / speeding in excess of 140MPH / crack cocaine possession of a scheduled narcotic / and due to the individual baggies I was also charged with intent to distribute / vehicular assault and … blah blah blah you know how it is a bunch of other stuff.

Anyways to lay for my Attorney Tyrone said it was cool if I a got a 3rd job. He said “You don’t do shit else but be sleeping all night get yo ass out there make that money before I beat the Mayo off yo ass” lol he has such a great sense of humor.

But he was right. What do I do after I get home to my garage after my second job but lay down and sleep for 4-6 hours anyways so I’m thankful he inspired me to be more in this world and to set goals and work towards them.

Not really any City busses though where I live so I bought a new bike and even though it’s over 28 miles one way to my first job it was really helping me tone my calves up.

That was until my bike was stolen. I don’t know how it happened, I had it in the garage and no one except us has access to the garage and there was no signs of forced entry.

Tyrone said it was probably one of my cracka ass cheeto smelling homeboys, but the thing is I don’t really have any friends. Anyways, YOLO amiright guys ?!"

2021-05-08 08:45:30,wallstreetbets,"Well, luckily you have some new ones like RKT/PLTR to start building your position at the bottom then eh?

History has proven that WSB is actually an amazing platform of great trades if you can learn to read the room right. By that I mean, buy RKT/PLTR now when its -20% and be the guy a year from now with 400% gains.(Not actual gains promised not financial advice blah blah you get the point)

If you see something explode 10x and then 30 YOLO posts? Short the ever loving fuck out of it.

I got 77 shares of CRSP, and 10 of the rest. I’m a grad student in stats and god willing, will be done with school and pass my classes on Monday (took one final yesterday, one more on Monday. If I pass these classes I’m done!) 

So my hope is once I start my big boy job I have lined up, I can get all these to 100 shares and in 20 years when they’re worth almost $1k I’ll be doing decent. Not great, but decent. The other money I’ll be earning will be going towards coins and meme stocks and options (gotta learn about those first though. I have an idea of what puts and calls are but idk how you make money with them). I don’t want to work for 46 fucking years. I’m 24. Working till 70 so I can retire is slavery. Fuck that shit."

There's a reason they were found guilty of fraud. If anything damning was actually said, they wouldn't have been breaking the law to make a chopped and screwed version.

2021-05-07 22:45:27,wallstreetbets,"I'm also bullish on CVS, not for the same reasons as most people - they are in my opinion a data vendor. They are the best pharmacy at gathering datasets for big pharma to use in the US.

What many people don't realize is all healthcare data is controlled and sold in the US. You'd think when you go to a hospital, all of that information could be used (blinded) for research purposes - but there are data networks that SELL the data for huge sums from hospital networks. The same with pharmacies. If big Pharma wants to know where their competitors are selling the most and where their salesforce planning needs to happen - they buy CVS's prescription data."

Then days letter I started getting calls from a phone I couldn’t find an office associated with, stating they were with contact tracing.  Thought it was phishing, but then got snail mail letter.  Looked back at the paperwork, and it said I was negative at the top, and positive at the very end.  Wtf.  Had another blood test, said I covid in the past."

2021-05-07 20:54:31,wallstreetbets,I have ZERO faith in options. A stock can be targeted by a big money institution and hold it at whatever price they want. You can't compete with automated hyper trading with an unlimited wallet. I'd be selling the 5/21 for sure. Not to mention having the liquidity to actually exercise the call. Maybe you wouldn't have trouble exercising but my first point still stands.

2021-05-07 21:29:35,wallstreetbets,"This is not true. Your brokerage will automatically exercise options on your behalf that expire in the money. If you do not have enough capital to purchase the shares, they will sell them on your behalf and give you the profits (minus a commission). This is known as exercise by exception and is in place to protect dumber than usual option traders. 

With that being said, there is no reason to ever let them expire and leave it up to your broker. Sell an hour before close on Friday and don’t spend the weekend sweating balls about it."

2021-05-08 01:14:51,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been looking for an answer to this question for months but can’t find one... who is buying your option hours before expiration? Obviously the break even is going to be higher than the current trading price of the underlying, so if the buyer immediately exercises to sell the 100 shares, they’re going to lose money, no? Can someone ***please*** let me know what I’m missing.

If I go to the options chain and pick an ITM option expiring EoW to exercise and sell immediately, I’m going to lose money. So who in their right mind is buying ITM options hours before they expire??"

2021-05-08 15:34:17,wallstreetbets,"Market makers. 

They have the cash flow to exercise the options and take the stock or release the stock depending on their position. They're doing millions of transactions so even a few pennies nets them a ton of money."

2021-05-08 07:29:29,wallstreetbets,"First response was legit. It was answering a question. Might wanna recheck where the politics came in chief. I swear the IQ and the getting offended so easily correlate in some way.

Least we know you can type a full sentence now. Kudos ✌️.

Here ill edit it. To make you feel better. I see we are allowed to say “retard”. Ok. Will adjust it.

Hope you redirected your scolding to the “retard” that actually brought it into politics - otherwise you’re a impulsive opportunistic hypocrite."
2021-05-08 18:02:13,wallstreetbets,"Kinda. Depends what price you're at. .05? Probably not. 5,000 and the spread is around 60 buck mark. No. Middle of the spread say 55 and 60 and for 58. Probably. 60? Almost sure because it can offset those transactions of the buyer on the other end and they likely own some the stock so it's breakeven or a small profit.

It just depends. The higher the volume the more likely it will"
2021-05-08 09:02:45,wallstreetbets,"You're the first person I've seen turn something political in months. It doesnt happen here. Cop the fuck on. That's literally the only issue.

2021-05-08 09:04:29,wallstreetbets,"So do you disagree with my answer to the question? The only valid response was agree or disagree with some facts to make a good argument. Instead the person took a political stance. So i called them out for their political affiliation.

You having a hard time keeping up? Maybe go re-read?

I can’t help but think you agree with mob-justice and now trying to avoid the substance of the actual answer. Pretty sad."
2021-05-08 10:43:51,wallstreetbets,"I disagree with HOW you answered the question because you made it political Vs talking about the facts of the case. I'm also not saying that the person you responded to was right, or that you're wrong

I can't stress it enough. You're literally the first person I've seen on this subreddit get political, in months. We don't do that here. Stop"
2021-05-08 11:13:28,wallstreetbets,"If you aren’t going to address the original argument and then try to spew out an opinion based on a lack of focus... then i can’t engage this, and i don’t care. Its a huge waste of time and is a red herring. “I swear there is a correlation between IQ and getting [triggered]”

I get you. You equate mob-justice with non-political, but it clearly was backed by one political group and now you don’t like that fact. It’s ok, but its pathetic."
2021-05-08 11:18:21,wallstreetbets,I addressed it 3 comments ago you fucking retard
2021-05-08 11:19:03,wallstreetbets,"This is not an argument. Based on your prev responses it is off topic again. Got a quote? Might have to check the edit. Calling someone a lib offends you so much, but saying crude and lame insults like, “dickhead” and “retard” don’t. But the level of projection indicates it should. Must be a lib"

2021-05-08 12:56:43,wallstreetbets,"I asked for the quote. You couldnt answer it clearly. Now going on another sideway rant. Ill address this rant like the others.

“Nobody cares about your political opinions.” Then why are you talking about politics.

I never argued over libtard or nazism. I used it as an insult, like you use retard, dick, and any other pejorative that is insensitive to people who actually can’t help their condition (third grade insults, indication of IQ).

Investors were shiortinf CVS for a reason, i gave a plausible reason. I’d appreciate if you avoid the hypocrisy and stay on topic, as i keep saying

Now you threaten to squelch my original argument (not shocked based on your leaning so far), and saying i am bringing up off topics, but you are the one that keeps it going with the off topics, while i keep asking for a counter or agreement to my original argument. Its a really strange projection."

3 days 35% odds

2021-05-07 22:06:07,wallstreetbets,"I am beginning to think a real bear market is impossible in our lifetimes. Think about it - the US government functions off taxes that are being taken from citizens and legal residents. The majority of the us residents consistently inject liquidity voluntarily into the stock market via 401k’s and retail trading in amounts that match their contributions to the US government. Everybody who comes across a large sum of money puts it into the stock market.
As long as the stock market remains popular and more people join it, it will keep growing. If you have doubts - look at how retail manages to keep GME, AMC, and other meme stocks at levels significantly higher than those companies would be at without the retail. If the US regulators came up with a solution that eliminates PDT rules we’d see a significant acceleration to this growth."

2021-05-08 02:18:08,wallstreetbets,"I think everyone is an insider in their own industry. For example, if you work in construction, you learned about rising lumber prices before everyone else, and know which companies could keep up with the demand. If you work in airlines you see when traffic is starting to increase, and which companies are handling the rapidly changing environment the best. If you work with tech, you knew when AMD finally became a serious competitor to Intel. 

If you have a hunch, add the stock to your watchlist, compare their quarter earnings performances to their yearly price chart, and keep your eye on volume. Webull and Robinhood have everthing you need to know even if you don't buy through them. It's amazing to me how many people keep buying SNDL with 100 million in volume every day. That stock is being scalped to death. Low volume and strong price support is the time to buy in. It's an indicator that everyone holding the stock is long, and it's the last thing they'll liquidate because they know it's worth more than it's current trading price. The flatter it trades the cheaper options are on red days too."

However, users will need to watch unskippable ads every 30mins, or pay 100$ each time to skip. Their Gotham and Foundry software will also be throttled and can only be sped up via 'speed boost' tokens, costing 200$ for a set for 5 tokens. Additionally, users can buy keys to open loot boxes that contain customizable skins for their software. If they are lucky, they can even win speed boost tokens.

If you took something as strong as spider silk and created a string long enough to reach space and had some way of pulling that string up into space, and you then tied successively stronger threads to it and continue to pull it out into space until you had a heavy rope attached to the ground leading all the way out to the Moon. Could you attach the other end to the moon and could you climb from Earth to the Moon if you had like a backpack full of food or something and like breathing gear etc.

Basically why can't we make a way to get into space with an elevator car on a rope."

2021-05-08 10:27:30,wallstreetbets,"SNL has far more misses than hits as far as funny skits go imo. Goes with being such an institution of comedy I guess, as opposed to when they were more of the “rebels” when it was founded. 

Does seem to go through occasional Golden periods when they have a cast that really clicks with each other. Different generations all seem to say SNL’s best years were different, usually whatever they grew up with."

2021-05-08 01:32:30,wallstreetbets,". Yeah you can ask DFV about that in the long term, and a lot of stocks that move up more than 5% on friday have the possibility of doing this on 0dte. 

Just today, at market open VIAC $39 0dte calls were not a penny but they were super low, maybe 0.05. But hours later at their peak they were above 50 cents. (I know this because I had them from a few weeks ago when it was trading at $37 and I watched the price action all day and managed to sell them for 0.45 for not a terrible loss when at open they were at -98%.)"
2021-05-08 01:41:22,wallstreetbets,"They’re priced like that for a reason, literal lotto tickets. 

With that said, you can make huge returns in a similar manner swinging SPY 0DTE towards close. Options prices regularly jump 2x-10x since they start off so cheap."

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The AirBNB Short Squeeze Full disclosure: I am a complete smooth-brained ape who jumped in and out of MVIS about 7 times in 1 week and risked 30k to make 3k.  I doubled-down on APHA and lost 20K but made 100K in CURLF.  I know nothing. I'm an idiot.  But I do alright for such a retard.

Here's the catch though:

I own a motel.

And in 30 years in the motel business, I have NEVER seen such advanced bookings as I've seen for this summer.  We grow about 5-10% a year, with each year topping the previous, except for 2019 of course - during that first year of COVID, while others lost upwards of 70% of their revenue, we were only off 10%.  We are a great choice for our little resort town. We were blessed to have a good year in 2020.

So this year? 2021?

This year?!?

**This year, bookings are 44% ahead of 2019 at the same time.**

We are stunned, overwhelmed, and excited about these numbers.  But more importantly, we think we know something people are 'thinking', but have no proof of: that this country is beyond ready to party, ready to travel, and ready for vacay.   You hear it all the time, ""People are ready to get out...""  But in my family, we have advance numbers that prove this to be fact.

I thought of moving money into the big retail hotel chains, but I've never played those stocks before, and would feel a little blind at my entry.

However, I AM holding AirBNB.  I've been holding that bag for awhile, and while I dropped my positions in a lot of flyers (SNAP for one), I held AirBNB for the very reasons outlined above.  Oh, we also have a condo in the same town, that usually sells out for the summer, usually with about a 2-3 week lead time for selling out.

Currently?

Currently, the condo is sold out.  For the entire fucking summer.  Already. It's because of all this, that I'm happily long on AirBNB.

**But it's because of THE FOLLOWING, that I suddenly have a half-mast chubby at another possibility:**

While googling GME's short float to see if I should add shares, I found this article from May 2nd, written by the Motel Fool.  Granted, there's not a lot of love for them here in WSB, but I don't have a problem with them and someone even posted some DD a few weeks back that their picks have indeed beat the S&P.  But fuck that.  Just read this and decide for yourself:

## Airbnb

*""Despite small-cap stocks being especially popular for short squeezes, it's megacap stay-and-hosting platform* ***Airbnb*** *(*[*NASDAQ:ABNB)*](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/airbnb-inc/abnb/) *that might offer one of the best shots at a pessimist-crushing rally in May. Approximately 19 million shares of the company's 109 million-share float are currently held by short-sellers, and it would take an estimated four days to completely cover these shares if pessimists were to get scared.*

*Beyond just having the right recipe for a short squeeze -- reasonably high short interest relative to float and a high short ratio -- Airbnb has three other catalysts in its sails.*

*First, the U.S. and global coronavirus vaccination campaigns are underway. In the U.S., almost 38% of the adult population is fully vaccinated, and close to 55% of the adult population has received at least one dose. These vaccinations are key to reaching herd immunity, which will encourage people to travel. Given the incredible amount of pent-up travel demand, Airbnb* *should shine in a post-pandemic worl\*\*d.*

*Second, the company is likely going to report its quarterly operating results in the next three or four weeks (it's yet to officially set a date as of the time of this writing). Airbnb's sales were* *already showing signs of improvement in the fourth quarter* *and could handily surpass Wall Street's expectations, especially when compared to the unprecedented uncertainty that reared its head toward the end of Q1 2020.* 

*Third and finally, Airbnb has a network effect that traditional hotels simply can't match. As* *noted by my colleague* *Jon Quast, a mere 9% of Airbnb's users booked a stay through the first nine months of 2020 because of an ad. The remaining 91% chose Airbnb because they're familiar with the company/marketplace. All of this gives the company a shot to burn short-sellers in May.* ""

For me, this is a perfect storm of my own knowledge of this particular industry, a name brand company, and a heavy short float.  This run down from 180 to 150 where we are now feels particularly weird to me - there's no reason ABNB shouldn't have jumped today with all of the other similar 'sexy' plays of new shit like, SNAP, ROBLX, etc.  Everything crept up, had a huge day today, but there was that weird ABNB in the red in the middle of a sea of green.  It didn't make any sense.  Why would it drop?  Now I know It's being shorted hard.  They are tilting lances.  I think this one could tilt back.

Just my two cents....  (granted, if this week's returns are anything to go by, it's more like my 1.5 cents)."
2021-05-08 15:53:32,wallstreetbets,"For earnings - fees are taken by ABNB on the booking and refunded later if need be. Is it booked as income and flows to earnings for this report as soon as booking is made? Or is it only recorded as profit when the booking has passed? If the latter than fuck it, there is no earnings play. If the former - could be interesting.

Read the comment of someone by-passing airbnb. I would never do that, I need the warranty and security. I would take a video of my house every time i would put it on airbnb - if there ever was an issue and the place got trashed I would be able to claim back. If it got smashed and I let in some random ass hole trash it, I would have no insurance. That said - airbnb customer service is attrocious and the service has a lot of issues. I have restarted booking with hotels since then as too many problems. I was a super host and a massive user of airbnb - but fees went a bit too crazy and markets was too pricey, you then realised you are better off booking straight with hotels.

Anyways /rant"
2021-05-08 02:51:41,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a no-brainer, if I understand this difficult English word well."
2021-05-08 13:00:27,wallstreetbets,They also have a customer service group that is useless and dogshit - supposed to resolve disputes between hosts and guests
2021-05-08 12:41:50,wallstreetbets,"Yep, it's a no brainer. I'm telling you from the inside out lodging is booking up at insane rates vs. every other year in history.  About 30k."
2021-05-08 12:47:14,wallstreetbets,"No need to be a douche about it, Motley Fool literally listed AirBNB as one of the top 3 short plays at the moment.  I stumbled upon the article and it intersected with my own DD on the stock.  I've had the stock since early on, but never knew the short float was high.

I hear so many fucking people bitching on this sub that they never get to be a part of these overnight 20% gains, always missing the train.  This is a stock that I like FUCKING ANYWAY, and never expect to see a 10-20% pop in one day.  But now I'm a aware of the short action on it and I think there's a chance is does make a big move soon - it has dropped absurdly off its highs compared to others, and it releasees earnings soon.  It meets a lot fo my own personal criteria, as well as the criteria of my mentor, who dropped nearly every other flashy stock he had (square, snap, etc.) and moved most of his money into Allstate and crushed it.  

But he kept ABNB. 

I'll preserve your screen name gonads and we can revisit the issue in a month or two.  Let's see how it does."
2021-05-08 12:48:09,wallstreetbets,Who gives a fuck what you take seriously?
2021-05-08 12:54:00,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it's a long hold with the potential for a short squeeze. 

\-The long hold is because i believe in it as someone inside the lodging industry.

\-The squeeze play potential is from The Motely Fool, not me. 

Take the two together and I like the stock. 

You seem lazy af"
2021-05-08 12:59:29,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck are YOU talking about? The short squeeze isn't my concept, its from the Motely Fool. 

Also nobody wrote 'to the moon' so why are you quoting it?  You just sound like an idiot."
2021-05-08 18:13:22,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for that, some very useful info in there."
2021-05-08 13:04:47,wallstreetbets,"Lol, newsflash, we've all used ABNB and anyone can tell you you're full of shit.  Two-thirds my ass.  I've booked at least 20 ABNB over the last 5 years and that's never happened once.

You act like this is some new trick.  Cutting out the OTA is the oldest game in the book.  Any host who gets caught doing this will be kicked of ABNB.  They can risk it, but it will blow up in their face eventually.  We've listed our condo for 4 years and have never done that, not even once.

Not to mention, not everybody wants to deal with a seller directly without the protection of ABNB.  You're playing with fire.  Those hosts could cancel on you at any time without repercussions, or the ability to write a review of them.

The hotel industry used to do this too, hoteliers would try to sneak around Expedia and [booking.com](https://booking.com) and reach out to guests directly...  guess what?  They've all given up on that in my town.  They've accepted that the OTAs provide a service, and a billion dollar marketing machine, and the 'sneaking around' isn't worth it. That practice has died out with hoteliers, and I predict the same pattern in the ABNB Hosts... eventually, they weigh risk vs. reward and realize they'd rather be on the platform than get kicked off."
2021-05-08 02:02:02,wallstreetbets,"Unpopular dissenting opinion:

I pretty much got used to a mask and even wore them voluntarily in winter (nice and warm instead of a cold face) and now (pollen filter that helps me with my hay fever) at times.

There really are worse aspects to this pandemic than these masks (rad tech, I wear the blooming things all day, every day. They do get in the way of a cup of coffee, mind)"

2021-05-08 13:13:05,wallstreetbets,"Dude - you can believe anything you want. I’m telling you from experience this has happened two out of the three times I have used ABNB as a guest this year for month+ long stays. 

The “protection” ABNB offers is useless. I contacted support on my one trip where I used them and had an issue and they were absolutely useless and slow to respond. 

Any host that gets bad reviews just takes down the listing and puts up another one 

This platform is useful for advertising - but actually booking through them is a waste of money for both hosts and guests

Now that they pay the same fees as hotels they have no advantage over a hotel (which actually does offer support that is useful)"

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$VZIO multi-bagger DD Alright dingleberries, listen up because I’m gonna keep this short and sweet like the amount of time your wife’s boyfriend allows you to have with her once a month.

Vizio is the second largest TV manufacturer in the United States (15% market share) and THE largest for soundbars (14% market share) with $2 billion in annual revenue. 

The company had the crappy luck of going public a few weeks ago during the March 2021 tech-selloff and faced a very tough IPO market anyways. The company's reputation as a hardware company is masking its small, but rapidly growing and extremely profitable advertising business that has grown at over 100% a year since it was established in 2018.

With its large market share in TVs, Vizio is finally ramping up its opportunity to monetize the millions of daily users of its SmartCast operating system (found on every Vizio television for you smooth-brains with Samsung). Essentially, they are getting paid every time someone turns on the TV and more (which again in this crowd, is a lot of you lardos). 

To put the contrasting economics into perspective, in 2020, the hardware business had 10% gross margins, contributed to 93% of total sales and 62% of total gross profit, and grew 7% YoY. Meanwhile, the platform/advertising business had 76% gross margins (up from 60% in 2018), contributed to only 7% of total sales but 38% of total gross profit, and grew at 132% YoY. At its current market cap of $4 billion, Vizio trades at 2x sales, less than 20x forward earnings, and has over $300 million in cash with no debt. As investor awareness improves regarding the high growth software platform, the stock's multiple should expand and narrow the valuation gap vs. peers like Roku. Shares are easily worth 2x to 4x the current price.

TL;DR $VZIO to the moon 🚀 🚀 🚀. Earnings are on 5/11. Own May 21 Calls and shares because I like the stock."

However, that isn't the case, as GME is heavily held by passively managed index funds.

Vanguard's small cap value fund VBR, for example, holds about $146 million worth of Gamestop shares. https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/portfolio/VBR/portfolio-holdings The same is true of most small cap value index funds.

https://www.ftserussell.com/resources/russell-reconstitution

Index funds are reconstituted once a year. For the Russell indexes, the finished index is communicated to market on June 25.

Last time the funds were reconstituted, GME was absolutely a value stock, trading at a great price to book value, so it was included in the index. 

When the index is reconstituted again, given its massively increased price and price to book ratio, it will almost certainly no longer be classified as value and thus dropped from value indexes.  This may lead to sell offs by funds that seek to track this index."

https://preview.redd.it/oapfsq1l6rx61.png?width=301&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0db680de7cd3c8e4a232005b11177a13ee685f3

First off, I don’t write DD’s. However, a user in the daily thread questioned my commitment to r/wallstreetbets. So here we go. Fuck you for making me do homework.

Also, I’m not going to mention short interest because you should invest in shit for better reasons (my personal opinion).

# 🚀 Energy Transfer ($ET) 🚀

&#x200B;

**Background**

Lets start this bitch by telling you who these guys (and gals) are. ET is basically a pipeline company that move, processes, and stores natural gas. They also do similar shit with crude oil.

ET has great diversity in their portfolio, with no single segment contributing more than 30% of the Partnership’s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the three months or full year ended December 31, 2020. The vast majority of the Partnership’s segment margins are fee-based and therefore have limited commodity price sensitivity.

Lets get the bad shit out of the way. ET built itself into one of the largest midstream energy companies. However, being a big dawg comes with big risks. They became a financial, regulatory, and political liability. So, when that nastiness with the Dakota Access Pipeline happened, they got hit pretty hard and a judge ordered a review. HOWEVER, the army is allowing the pipeline to stay open during the review which should last till March 2022.

&#x200B;

**ET owns a lot of shit:**

* Only provider with export facilities on both the U.S. Gul Coast and East Coast
* Owns the largest above-ground oil facility in the U.S.
* controlling interests in Sunoco LP,
* 100% of Sunoco Logistics Partners Operations L.P.,
* the general partner of USA Compression Partners L.P.,
* 100% of Lake Charles LNG, which owns an LNG import terminal and regasification facility
* 9,400 miles of natural gas transportation pipelines
* 3 natural gas storage facilities in Texas
* 12,200 miles of interstate natural gas pipelines
* 36.4% of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline
* 60% of the Bayou Bridge Pipeline
* 50% of the Florida Gas Transmission pipeline,
* 100% of the Trunkline Pipeline, Transwestern Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern, Sea Robin Pipeline, Revolution Pipeline, and Mariner East Pipelines.
* 32.6% of the Rover Pipeline.

&#x200B;

**Renewable stuff if you’re into it:**

* \~20% of electrical energy purchased by ET originates from renewable sources (put your boner away Joey B)
* [https://cms.energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Powering-Renewables-FN.pdf](https://cms.energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Powering-Renewables-FN.pdf)

&#x200B;

**Technical Analysis:**

I don’t really believe in it. But here are some charts for you crayon eaters.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qjrfu0ad6rx61.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cced164fb934ee049def7be9e3ad07bbd217f7f

**Fundamentals and Recent Accomplishments/Developments:**

**Operational**

* In January 2021, the first Very Large Ethane Carrier (“VLEC”) was loaded under ET’s joint venture with Satellite Petrochemical USA Corp., Orbit Gulf Coast NGL Exports, LLC. The Seri Everest, the world’s largest VLEC, departed from Orbit’s newly constructed export facility at our Nederland Terminal in Nederland, Texas, as the largest single shipment of ethane to date.
* In December 2020, the Partnership completed the expansion of its Nederland Terminal LPG facilities to increase its export capabilities.
* Also during the fourth quarter of 2020, the Partnership completed a new 20-inch pipeline directly linking its fractionation and storage facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas to its Nederland Terminal.
* In October 2020, the Partnership released its Community Engagement Report, which highlights ET’s business achievements and safety programs, as well as its stakeholder outreach and community investment initiatives.

&#x200B;

**Strategic**

* In February 2021, the Partnership announced the acquisition of Enable Midstream Partners, LP (“Enable”) in a $7.2 billion, all-equity transaction.
* In November 2020, the Partnership announced its first-ever dedicated solar power contract, which will reduce the Partnership’s environmental footprint by integrating alternative energy sources when economically beneficial. The Partnership continues to increase its focus on near and long-term alternative energy projects aimed at reducing its environmental footprint throughout its operations.
* In February 2021, the Partnership announced the creation of a new group that will focus on alternative energy initiatives.
* With the addition of ethane export facilities at our Nederland Terminal, the Partnership now owns two of the three U.S. ethane export terminals, and is the only company with export facilities on the Gulf Coast and East Coast.

&#x200B;

**Financial**

* In January 2021, ET announced a quarterly distribution of $0.1525 per unit ($0.61 annualized) on ET common units for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. The distribution coverage ratio for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 3.30x.
* As of December 31, 2020, Energy Transfer Operating, L.P.’s (“ETO’s”) $6.00 billion revolving credit facilities had an aggregate $2.79 billion of available capacity, and the leverage ratio, as defined by its credit agreements, was 4.31x.
* Energy Transfer completed 2020 with full-year Adjusted EBITDA of $10.53 billion, which was above the high end of estimates provided in August 2020.
* For 2021, the Partnership expects Adjusted EBITDA to be $10.6 billion to $11.0 billion, excluding any contribution from the recently announced Enable acquisition.
* For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Partnership spent approximately $3.05 billion on growth capital expenditures. The Partnership expects to spend approximately $1.45 billion on growth capital expenditures in 2021, including approximately $250 million of 2020 growth capital that was deferred into 2021.

The fee based cash flow contributes to \~95% of their EBITDA. The fees come from transport and storage fees (duh).

Insider Ownership: 14.5% as of Dec 2020 which is pretty significant.

Average Daily Volume: 17.86 mil, so pretty liquid. But has bee above the average lately due to the blowout earnings.

Last Earnings was yesterday (May 6th) and they killed it by 306.01% for EPS (expected 0.3, reported 1.22) and 44.34% for revenue (expected 11.77B, reported 17B).

# Fair Value Estimate 🚀  🚀  🚀 :

    Tipranks: Strong Buy - $9.00-$16.00 ; Median @ 11.71
    Morningstar: 5 stars, $18

**Why I think it’s good:**

I’m getting bored so I’m going to keep this part short. I think ET is good because they have a strong balance sheet and are starting to rebound.

The Biden administration is going to make it difficult to get permits for pipeline companies. Paradoxically, this is *good* for the large, established pipeline companies like ET. Many operators have taken a growth-at-any-cost approach, looking to build empires irrespective of profitability. A world in which no new pipelines get built is a world in which serial empire builders like Energy Transfer have a lot more free cash on hand. 

ET basically just needs to sit back, and let the gas flow. Do nothing. Get Paid

Additionally, ET cut their dividend a while back. This has bee priced in and will allow them to aggressively pay off their debt.

And without the temptation to spend cash on new projects under a Biden administration, Energy Transfer could eventually be in a better position to buy back units or even begin building its distribution back up again. 

Also, ET is an alien. Aliens have rocket ships that can fly to the moon **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀** .

**Positions:**

Mostly calls since the volatility is low. I also park premium from my other strategies here, as shares.

    55 shares @ 8.47, but will be adding over time. Dividends are nice.
    50 Calls, June 18, Strike - $10
    5 Calls, January 21st 2022, Strike - $7 LEEEEEEEEEAP

**TL;DR – Don’t pass on gas. ET phone home 🚀  🚀  🚀 .**

Edit: Added additional discussion regarding the Biden administration, and how it positively impacts ET."
2021-05-07 23:44:41,wallstreetbets,"I keep hearing the same tired line, as I've been shouting from the rooftops for people to get on ET and oil. 

""Oil has had a run im waiting for the pullback.""

Yes, oil has had a run and ET just smashed it, but this is oil season baby. Unlike overvalued tech etc, oil was destroyed by the pandemic and has not recovered. I.E. oil has more room to run than other sectors. 

It is baffling that people would try and time the market when its literally one of the oldest cliches that you dont try and time the market. 

Tldr: oil is gonna keep running and you're a fool if you're waiting to time it."
2021-05-08 00:00:24,wallstreetbets,"Also, as a soon-to-be-graduated law student who just took a course on remedies (injunctions), i strongly believe ET has the stronger legal case against an injunction. An injunction is meant to preserve the status quo. The line is already built, and oil is already flowing. Thus, preserving the status quo would be to keep the line open. 

Additionally, to get an injunction there must be the threat of immediate and irreparable harm. Not the mere possibility, but actual imminent threat. The tribe's argument is ""maybe possibly the line might break which might harm our water supply."" I dont think this cuts it. 

Another element is the balance of hardships. Leaving the line open is really no hardship on the tribes. Saying ""maybe possibly it might break"" is not a hardship. On the other hand, pro pipeline tribes, the entire Bakken Shale region, several states, and numerous companies stand to lose billions of dollars by a shutdown.  

The only way this injunction gets granted is through straight up judicial activism. If the judge says no injunction, this baby is primed for an even bigger liftoff.

2021-05-08 08:11:45,wallstreetbets,It's bigger than most people realize. The judge granting an injunction would be saying the Corps doesn't know how to do their job and would instantly call into question every permit they have ever issued. Im sure you can see how much of a shitshow that would be.

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Expanding the DD on $INO (tl;dr it went down because it is massively shorted for no reason) So I just read [this very interesting post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n70cim/my_first_dd_im_a_doctor_and_i_think_ino_is_about/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) and I went on to see what I could about $INO.

Thing is, despite all of OP’s arguments being totally true (company being releasing cutting-edge tech, next one being Brain Cancer potential first treatment), the stock has been raising and plunging all the way from $6 to $33 back to $6.80 in the pandemic. 

This can be explained by the hope it would come out with a covid vaccine using a revolutionary technology, but it is weird that it plunged that much because although they lost the government’s investment at the end, this new tech is apparently still promising, and it’s even weirder considering all the other stuff and Brain Cancer thing. 

However, I then found [this article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-23/inovio-drops-after-u-s-cuts-off-funding-short-sellers-benefit)

Basically, it says that later in 2021, the stock have been massively shorted to the amount of $634 million.

Guess who’s on the list ? Yes, Citron Capital at it again, apparently it was their main gains for 2021, but they’re not the only ones and this has made the stock fall despite really good fundamentals as shown in OP’s post.

Conclusion and tl;dr: $INO is, among a lot of other great projects, literally working on the first promising Brain Cancer treatment EVER, yet some guys are heavily shorting it to the point it could very well go bankrupt. 

I’m long $INO, yolo and fuck Brain Cancer"
2021-05-08 14:16:05,wallstreetbets,"I'm long because I went over the DD and I agree with it, but I can tell you right now why it's shorted to hell.

They don't have a product.  They've never had a product.  Every time a new pandemic hits, they hype up a vaccine and never deliver one.  This is the issue.  They have a proven track record of never delivering anything, never making money, and never accomplishing anything.

That being said, I still see a good opportunity to make money here by going long on $INO"
2021-05-07 21:48:34,wallstreetbets,"Yes  you are right . Rogue shortsellers have manipulated this stock especially in the last year. I have no doubt that commercialisation of INO’s first product is imminent  with an  EUA . Advaccine , INO’s China partner has just filed for an HK IPO with Covid INO 4800  as the core product supporting their listing valuation .  
INO also has over 400 M cash on their balance sheet which will give them bargaining power in the event of any takeover bid . Stock price is heavily orchestrated as with Tesla in the early days ( I am a Tesla LT shareholder) .

Once the tables are turned with the weight of money of more LONG investors, shortsellers will be trapped as with the gamestock saga ."

2021-05-07 23:28:02,wallstreetbets,"What you said sounds reflective of the way the world works too. Every small business and practice is being bought up by private equity, merged into one of the big businesses in the name of efficiency, which it is efficient.

It’s the reason business can get all their needs satisfied and corporations can pay for all the best talent because they sell all the shit. 

Everyone as a consumer wants efficient markets because it means good prices. So saying you want to support smaller companies, while actually just being nostalgic and idealistic doesn’t do anything. 

It’s just saying: here’s some money, go try and compete or pivot your business model 15 years too late."

2021-05-08 00:10:22,wallstreetbets,"Private equity firms are essentially trying to monopolize businesses by buying a series of smaller businesses, combining it and selling it to the highest bidder. It’s business model has nothing to do with efficiency, rather it is about taking advantage of an undervalued product. If the pe firm operated as a mutually beneficial coop/share cropping firm, that would be the most mutually beneficial way to have the business benefit everyone, but few pe firms will ever invest that way.        

Efficient markets and payment for order flow are the same thing. It’s a way to confuse the consumer into giving you more money. Aka a scam. If the producer wants consistent returns, they would consistently produce for the consumer which would lead to market efficiency.      

No, having a publicly traded company isn’t like having a 15 year lifeline to compete. A lot of publicly traded companies will get shorted near lockup expiration and as soon as they develop something their competitors want.         

You talk like someone sucking corporate dick, and willing to throw anybody under the bus for a profit, including family."
2021-05-08 02:44:14,wallstreetbets,Short selling should be at the very least temporarily banned. It doesn’t create market liquidity. It creates an imbalance in the supply and demand. In short it turns a free market into a Ponzi scheme. Releasing critical reports of companies should be allowed in order to give the INVESTORS a chance to close out their positions. It should be illegal for companies to short a company prior to releasing critical data. They should be happy with receiving 500k+ instead of trying to be greedy and drive a company to bankruptcy at the expense of retail investors instead of letting the original investors bankrupt the company by closing out their positions. Corruption and Ponzi schemes are all that short selling enables. Anybody claiming to release critical information for the good of the public should do it without shorting the stock and happily receiving payment from the SEC or another government whistleblowing agency.

They still have quite a while before it’s even considered for approval which is why I’m passing through on it. 

I strongly disagree with their tech being head, and shoulders above other biotech companies. There is a huge number of drugs for GBM that are much further along. Once again I haven’t looked at the data since I’m not going after cancer treatments. It’s just my $0.02."
2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Capital gains question Couldn't find any information on the Internet. Maybe one of you all knows.



Question: 

 I had a stock for just under a year and was waiting to sell to avoid capital gains taxes. Then right before the year was up the company was merged with another.  So I was given shares of the company that bought the original company that I owned stock in as the old company no longer exists. Simple merger. 

 Do I have to wait an entire year from when I was given the new company's stock? Or is it already passed the year as I had the old company's stock more than a year ago? 

Hopefully I explained this well enough. 

Thanks"

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Grab that cup of coffee/red bull/brawndo you caffeinated retards and let’s have a chat about $JO, the coffee futures ETF. I never post on WSB, but I’ve been following this trend for a few weeks now and have made my entry. $JO is the only coffee ETF and it is the only coffee FUTURES ETF out there. For that reason, you can capture the coming explosion of coffee prices through $JO. On May 6th (Thursday), arabica coffee beans hit their 4-year high and robusta beans hit an 8-month high. On Friday, the futures slumped a touch (-2%). However, the fundamentals for why coffee prices are about to explode are still running strong.

Coffee production runs on a two-year cycle, trees are harvested annually, but the second year is typically the bumper crop year. 2021 is supposed to be that “bumper” crop year. $JO has gotten some love during each one of these run-up cycles on WSB, look at the 15 people in these threads who have jumped on over the last few years and made some money. This year we are looking at a number of factors that could lead to “structural deficits” in coffee supplies, as the agricultural exporter Olam International termed it. 

**Factors** 

* Drought in Brazil. Brazil is facing an historic drought and rainfall is currently at 2% of its historical pace. Coffee trees need rain and precipitation. This has lead to a massive cut to the expected Brazilian output of coffee. Lower supply = higher price
* Brazilian real increasing in value. After a terrible 18 months for the Real’s value vs. the US dollar, it rebounded substantially the last week. This will increase the USD cost of the Brazilian coffee exports. Higher exchange rate = higher price
* Re-opening of the US economy. All you retards want re-opening plays. Get off AAL and look at commodities. Look at Starbucks all over the country closed up. Now supercharge basic white ladies with some 5g vaccine microchip vaccines who want some ‘bucks. Of course, you’ll also be in line with for your wife and her boyfriend’s coffee, looking at a line around the block trying to buy that sweet foamy coffee that has increased in price by 50%. Higher demand = higher price 
* Futures contracts and supply. So guess what happens when there’s drying up supply? Highest bidder gets the coffee! 

Think back to your elementary school education, in between drawing dicks on your friend’s notepad, you probably learned about something called “supply and demand.” Guess what, when supply tanks and demand rockets, prices go up. 

**Buying Strategy**

Note that options are offered for May, July, September of 2021. This is because coffee futures are sold on the same two-month cycle.

**Will I end up with a ton of coffee on my driveway?**

No you fucking ape, this is a futures ETF, not a futures contract. 

**TL;DR:** Drought, weather damage, re-opening of the economy this summer, and already-historic coffee price highs could drive up futures prices all summer into 2022. Buy $JO stock or options and capture the caffeine panic. 

**Personally:** 4x $44c September 2021"
2021-05-07 22:01:55,wallstreetbets,"I'd venture to say that if you drink coffee, you know that no one stopped drinking coffee.  I don't think the reopening angle is valid. Maybe briefly as out of home and in home demand crosses over.

Climate is having a big impact. Civil unrest is having an impact.

Brazil basically puts out a doom and gloom report every year that makes the C pop- untimely frost, rain. Then they have monster production. Not saying you are wrong but we're not looking at a new story.

Coffee production has become so effective from the big players in the last 5+ years that supply has overtaken demand to a degree. Note sub $1 futures relatively regularly in recent history. Buy when it hits a buck not $1.50.

Just my opinion."

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Float, short interest and what it all means I see a lot of bad assumptions made over the gme is 120% shorted statement.

Float is a pool of available shares to short not the total number of shares of that stock. These are typically owned by market makers and brokers or the company itself.

Short interest is the amount of this float being borrowed by traders to short.

Naked shorting that pushes SI above 100% is simply borrowing shares not available to borrow because someone like me owns those shares.

So when a stock is shorted 120% of its float, people did illegal naked shorting and borrowed shares not available to borrow, shares privately owned. Nothing new got created.

A squeeze can happen when the price is driven up by enough people trying to find shares to cover their short that are not currently available to borrow as more people like you and me buy and hold actual shares or ""boomer shares"" as zoomers call them, further decreasing the available float(causing a low liquidity issue in the stock) and their broker margin calls them (so the price goes up until it hits what someone like me or maybe you will sell their share for) 

Buying options only will likely NEVER trigger a squeeze..

Also if a short trader gets upside down enough.. they can always declare bankruptcy and settle (if they owe more than they are worth) then nothing much happens to the stock price and mr. Bankruptcy isn't going to buy a single one, his debts are clean depending the chapter declared.

Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth have an NTM EV-to-sales multiples of 6.3x and 16.0x.

Unfortunately Jeff Bezos ethical standards, Amazon work environment, the way they stole business from smaller third party seller, the flood of low quality fake Chinese product on their site turns me away. I am sure that their cloud service is huge but I would rather use Microsoft.  Hope to get behind a company with better culture meanwhile I am losing out on their stock gain."

I still get updates sent to my old email and it bothers me every time I see it 😣😖... the portfolio is around 150k after like 10 years of me never touching it starting with 10k.. F my life

Not to be a dick, but it isn't hard to get to 250k when you start with more than most people ever have in their accounts. A 3X isn't anything to laugh at, but there are so many different investments that could have been made with that sort of money that would have made her a millionaire or near millionaire.

Edit: Actually, you know what, fuck it. Shit like this shows a decline in the sub. This is Boomer-tier investing. Since when is investing in a safe company the WSB way? 3x over 4 fucking years?!?! I want to see rags to riches, not some middle class person becoming slightly richer. I want to see risky, retarded gambling that makes no sense and somehow pays off, not some Karen's portfolio.

2021-05-08 00:16:11,wallstreetbets,"I think Bumble has the shittiest business model. It's way too expensive and everything feels like a bad deal

Tinder plus is very simple for 10$ a month or whatever you get a great value. With Bumble it feels like 20$ a month, plus you have to buy 3-12 months at a time, and then it's not all that much greater than regular bumble"

I became disabled, and our daughter became seriously ill and had to be flown to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, where we stayed for months while she underwent treatment.  My mother developed brain cancer, and my father dementia.  My husband took time off work to care for all of us. We spent all of our savings, 401K, and pensions paying for medical bills and the additional costs of care.  We also helped friends who couldn’t pay their mortgage for 6 months.
We could’ve declared bankruptcy and protected our retirement, but we paid everything we owed instead.  You probably think it was kind of foolish, but it seemed like the right thing to do at the time."

People like you have absolutely no chance of being successful at this and it will only make your life even more miserable than it already is(hard to believe, I know). 

If you are really that obsessed with a strangers sex life and must know more, I have had sex with over 50 women in my lifetime and have been in multiple long term relationships. You calling me an incel has about as much effect as calling a white person the n-word. You come off as a hambeast just shouting incel into the wind. 

Clearly the molestation in your adolesnce has had a deep psychological and phsyiolocogical effect on you. It has lead to a reclusive lifestyle of over eating and lashing out at people online, which has manifested itself in you commenting nearly 500 times on reddit in less than three weeks. Ironically, these are all the traits of the incel you so vehemently project onto others. 

My only suggestion to you(not that you'll take it) would be to take your own advice and to seek therapy. Being angry on the internet all day everyday will not make your life better, it will only make you fatter and sadder. Go for a walk or something, burn some of those calories and get some sunshine, do literally anything other than what you're doing right now. I dont think you realize how painfully obvious it is that you are a sad repulsive humanbeing desperately trying to make herself feel some sort of normalcy. I know you're mad at your dad for not being there for you to protect you from the bad men, but calling people incels on reddit will not bring him or his affection back."

2021-05-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Bank stocks will ""pay back"" billions of dollars to investors in 2021 Hi,

It looks like banks have released piles of cash in reserves they had set aside for bad loans that didn't happen. And now this money will trickle down to investors through a record amount of announced buybacks for 2021. This substack story gives a great explanation of the mechanics of how this will play out:

[https://meanwhileinmarkets.substack.com/p/-the-fed-unleashed-a-mega-bullish](https://meanwhileinmarkets.substack.com/p/-the-fed-unleashed-a-mega-bullish)

Key part:

Now, let’s look at the news from this whole new perspective.

The Fed let America’s six largest banks buy back as much as $11 billion worth of shares this quarter. That’s a lot, but there’s a good chance it’s just the tip of the iceberg.

For example, JP Morgan (JPM) alone is drawing up to buy $30 billion of its shares in 2021. For perspective, that’s 20% more than its previous record in 2019. (When JPM soared a record 42% in a year.)

And all this should be music to investors’ ears for a couple of reasons.

For one, the Fed tips off that banks may have set aside way more cash than this crisis will call for. And part of this pile could quickly end up in shareholders’ pockets through buybacks.

In fact, the banks have been paying out just 30% of their profit to shareholders in dividends. And [a Bloomberg analysis](https://click.mailerlite.com/link/c/) shows the Fed’s “allowance” can bring their payouts to 100% of banks’ average net income over the past year.

Second, Wall Street banks have largely lagged the market during Covid. But buybacks and a growing appetite for recovery stocks (including banks) could launch bank stocks into a catch-up rally next year.

“That’s been one of the real missing points to the bank stocks: their ability to go in and buy back their own stock,” Gerrard Cassidy, Head of US Bank Equity Strategy at RBC Capital Markets told CNBC.

And for those reasons, bank stocks have an important place in my portfolio for 2021."

And that's gonna be a good long while. So no. They're not gonna rebound any time soon, or at all."
2021-05-08 10:29:36,wallstreetbets,"Many devs on the Witcher had left causing them to grow a new workforce for Cyberpunk. Those devs are now more seasoned due to Cyberpunk, but I doubt we will see anything of the same caliber of the Witcher for some time unless they radically change their team. Given that they are in Poland it will likely be harder for them to build up a new force as competent as their earlier team. Some of the head developers of the Witcher 3 left only recently.


That said; Cyberpunk wasn't a game but a series of tech demos that lead to a game over multiple years. That contributed to the game's state as it is now as there was a lot of restarts. Assuming they fix that at a managerial level the next game will likely be better than Cyberpunk by a wide margin. It is doubtful that they will release something on the level of Cyberpunk again; unless they have another workforce shake-up.


Smartest thing would be for them to make a follow-up to the Witcher 3 in the same engine; Writing, design, textures (and even then W3 on PC was comparable to some recent titles now) & a handful of new mechanics on-to that engine would then be all that would be needed from a project standpoint. That would maximize returns & allow them to coast by on a less experienced team.


CD Projekt does not have the rights to the Witcher as a whole. They are not involved in the Netflix show in any capacity. The Witcher brand is a series of short stories / novels that CD Projekt bought the game adaptation rights to in the early 2000s & it is that series' author that has a deal with Netflix as he owns all other adaptation rights. The studio is responsible, almost solely, with it's popularity outside of Poland but games are where their returns on that responsibility ends. The only money the studio will make from the series is if they ride on it's coattails with a new product around the time of a season of the series; which they have not done.


CD Projekt manages GOG, a game distributor that is a competitor to Steam. They are to a point superior to Steam in selling older titles where they will often do some porting work to improve their compatibility with newer operating systems. This service, as far as I'm aware, does not make a lot of money. Old games are cheap & they lack many features Steam has that people may want for newer titles. The Epic Games Launcher is now eating more into their bottom line as well.


Doubt it will hit CP hype stock levels for a long while as they have; in a few ways; shot themselves in the foot. They have money, but lack the ability to live up to their pre CP expectations for some time. Netflix is largely irrelevant unless they get a new Witcher to market while it's still in the public eye."

2021-05-08 07:56:16,wallstreetbets,Have you looked at their Financials? The failed launch of CP haven't had a big negative impact on earnings. Game is fine on pc and probably ps5 aswell. Will get re-released on ps4 at some point too. I think cdpr will be doing just fine in the next couple of years. Definitely oversold atm.

Also, phase 1,2,3 trials are NOTORIOUS for falsifying data.  I've been burned twice on that kind of shit.

***We have incurred losses since inception, expect to incur significant net losses in the foreseeable future and may never become profitable.***

We have experienced significant operating losses to date; as of September 30, 2020, our accumulated deficit was approximately $881.9 million. We have generated limited revenues, primarily consisting of license revenue, grant funding and interest income. We expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses for at least the next several years as we advance our clinical trials and research and development activities. We may never successfully commercialize our DNA vaccine, DNA immunotherapy and dMAB product candidates or electroporation-based synthetic vaccine delivery technology and thus may never have any significant future revenues or achieve and sustain profitability."

2021-05-08 16:27:45,wallstreetbets,"I'm an investor in INO.  Not financial advice, but why I love the company:

1) Stock has been heavily shorted and shorts have made lots money off of vaccine delay even with promising treatments in HPV and what OP addressed.  If you look at price, think of it like Gamestop.  Not reflective of underlying value of company.  WSB coming on board could legit change the world and bring DNA medicine to the forefront like it deserves.

2) None of the delay in INO COVID vaccine (4800) has been attributable to the performance of their vaccine itself.  Have been external issues like FDA reviewing their innovative delivery mechanism, Cellectra.  Some believe that vested interests held up DNA technology to allow for Pfizer and Moderna and mRNA to have their day in the sun.  Can't say for sure.  Most recent price-drop was related to DoD ending funding of Phase 3 for vaccines now that US has critical mass.  Again, nothing attributable to the performance of the vaccine itself.  
3) INO is still ideal vaccine provider for emerging and developing world. No cold storage requirements.  Fewer adverse reactions.  Already has distribution partnership lined up with Advaccine in China.   Just needs greenlight from China trial.

4) INO is ideal for booster shots (4802) as well in developed world.  Each additional mRNA booster shot elicits worse symptoms.  INO's stronger safety/tolerability profile make it a better option for booster.  So even in the US, we're not done with vaccines.  This has always been true for mRNA vaccines, but it is just now coming out.  
5) They're on the cusp of their Phase 2 data which will finally get them over the hump. Preliminary paper published this Saturday look very encouraging.  
6) Cellectra is a way to help protect INO's IP. Given recent concern about IP protection with vaccines, INO has a complementary hardware that is also patent-protected.

7) Also have tested against variants with positive results.  Able to formulate solutions rapidly as mutations occur.  Really believe that INO will be the one to end the COVID issue.  INO produces t-cells and antibodies, making it a more potent vaccine."
2021-05-08 15:11:24,wallstreetbets,"In my humble opinion , with Inovio being one of the most shorted stock in the market this will teach Wall Street a lesson from retail if there is a GME like squeeze and it serves them right for playing with fire!! How can you depress a company inventing a cancer & covid 19 cure with here this NO SIDE effects or deaths from there products whatsoever !!!! Also stable at room temperature so they can scale up and store at an accelerated rate. Yet the government’s purchase vaccines that make people ill and even kill some people?

The current market is $369m in the US. The projected global market by 2027 is $1.8 b. They would have to split that with Regeneron in some way. It could help fund the pipeline if managed diligently. Thankfully they have a partner who can push it through FDA approval. If it were up to Kim it might never make it. I could see where Regeneron could buy them out on the cheap if they continue to struggle bringing drugs to market. It would be most unfortunate if Kim & Co sold us out at this point for 3 sawbucks."

Too much can ransack your investment with clinical trials etc. You could have an awesome cure for a rare brain cancer, but if it’s too rare then the market is too small. Don’t follow my advice either. I put too much money in a small un-diversified portfolio of volatile stocks waiting for them to pop and then sell. Probably going to lose it all, but that’s ok.

2021-05-07 22:45:43,wallstreetbets,"Just a grain of salt here....the trial data cited was from 2019.  Since then, more data has been published, and it is still promising BUT - they need to run larger scale trials against the standard of care to be able to truly demonstrate the kind of game changing results that would push the stock considerably higher

2021-05-07 21:02:34,wallstreetbets,"Hm a bit skeptical here. This seems like DD that is readily available to any institution, let alone retail traders. There's no detangling or ""a ha!"" here besides looking up public info (no offense Dr!)

Why isn't this priced in already? There has to be a catch otherwise.

The treatment op mentions is not even mentioned as a candidate here https://www.fool.com/premium/coverage/investing/2021/04/30/3-turnaround-stocks-91-to-104-upside-wall-street/

Not to mention, inovio has the dubious track record of not having _any_ of its experimental methodologies being approved by the FDA in the last FOUR DECADES

Might get buried. But also wanted to encourage folks to do their own DD as well. Good luck to all!"
2021-05-08 10:40:02,wallstreetbets,"Dr.’s are the worst investors in the world:
1) intelligent 
2) trained to believe they are right (important to have conviction when making life or death decisions and to generate credibility with patients)
3) make $xxxk straight outta school and after they get into a good practice can move into >$1m, all without actually “operating a business” and learning things with smaller amounts of money, the only place this is worse is trust fund kids who don’t listen to their parents/grandparents and NBA/NFL/MLB where 20 year olds make millions without having any $ experience and they typically are not intellegent and usually have a bigger target on their backs for family and friends and “financial advisors” to take all there money (I digress)
4) get way too excited about new therapies/drugs
5) don’t understand the naunces and challenges in software & hardware development"
2021-05-07 20:16:30,wallstreetbets,"The Inovio study results are very promising, but there is a glaring error in your DD. The anti-PD1 antibody, which is already manufactured/marketed by Regeneron, is being used *in combination with* Inovio’s cancer vaccine INO-5401 (PSMA, TERT, WT1 antigens) and INO-9012 (IL-12 cytokine). Anti-PD1 therapy alone provides no benefit in GBM. As far as I can tell, the DNA encoding these proteins is delivered via electroporation to generate an anti-tumor immune response."
2021-05-07 23:42:02,wallstreetbets,That chart is bearish as fuck
2021-05-07 20:23:20,wallstreetbets,Hope I didn't YOLO my money into NIO but pretty sure I bought some INO calls.
2021-05-07 20:29:03,wallstreetbets,The terrible part is they failed to produce a successful vaccine. There whole involvement has brought a lot of noise to the stock price and increased the implied volatility of the options. I would be on board to bet on the outcome of those conferences if they had never tried to make a vaccine. I do hope the GBM treatment is a great success!!
2021-05-07 20:45:25,wallstreetbets,I don't have alot of money amd am only doing small trades right now but I threw in 30$ I know it's not alot but hopefully it turns into something more that I can invest with in the future

2021-05-07 21:20:47,wallstreetbets,Why did it spike in July 2020 and then crash? Was that based on the same drug?
2021-05-07 21:40:57,wallstreetbets,"How many people suffer from GBM? And without sounding insensitive, how does FDA approval of this patent, translate in share value/market cap accordingly?"

We were all drinking beers and playing board games at my friend's house in the summer of 2018 and this guy tells everyone at the table that he has cancer and he's expected to die in 6 months. Years go by he's still alive and even though he claims he's on chemo there's never been any noticeable deterioration in his health. Even his parents accused him of lying but he's still saying he has cancer. Only thing me and my friends can think of is he's embarrassed about losing his hair to male pattern baldness so he thinks people will accept his bald ass more if he has cancer. Dudes a nut."

2021-05-07 20:21:45,wallstreetbets,"The FDA put a hold on Inovio due to their Cellectra device. The device that administers the vaccine. It's pretty strange actually because the FDA did the same thing with VGX-3100. Something to do with shelf life of the device.
Or as many believe, a way to stop Inovio from advancing too quickly. It has nothing to do with the vaccine itself. And as I'm sure many know, the fraud Fauci and Bill Eugenics Gates hold many corona patents and Fauci has ties to Moderna. 
Anyhow, Time will tell."
2021-05-08 09:09:18,wallstreetbets,"from the Inovio press release: "" Survival data at 18 months showed that 70% (14/20) of MGMT promoter methylated GBM patients were alive, and 50% (16/32) of MGMT promoter unmethylated patients, which are the more difficult to treat group, were alive after 18 months. Median overall survival in the unmethylated GBM patients was 17.9 months, which compares favorably to historical controls; Median OS for methylated patients has not yet been reached and the study is ongoing.

2021-05-07 22:02:53,wallstreetbets,"In regards to cervical cancer It depends how cheap they can make that and if they can distribute worldwide. In first world countries cervical dysplasia is “less” of an issue now that there has been an HPV vaccine for a number of years. We also have other procedures to treat HSIL already outside of a vaccine that I don’t think would be replaced by one. 

That said if you could make it cheap, temp stable, and distribute it to the third world it could dramatically change the cervical cancer game. People in resource poor nations do not have access to traditional expensive, labor intensive treatments for HSIL. That’s why cervical cancer rates are so much higher. 

BIG ASTRRISK. HPV is becoming increasingly realized to be the source of head and neck cancer in addition to cervical cancer (all men - go get your HPV vaccine!) and this could potentially be a big deal for that. I’d have to look more into it."

They are behind, yes.
According to [vaccine tracker](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-vaccinations-tracker.html), 16% of the worlds population has received one dose of vaccine. Everyone (except those that got j&j) will need two shots, plus will probably need at least one booster shot again six months later. There's plenty of time for INO-4800 to catch up.

2021-05-07 21:33:35,wallstreetbets,How much stock did you buy?
2021-05-08 08:45:20,wallstreetbets,You are absolutely right . Lawsuit was orchestrated by Dirty shorts and has zero merit.
2021-05-07 22:56:15,wallstreetbets,"The Covid vaccine was slow tracked by the FDA who chose big Pharma mRNA vaccines which needs refrigeration .They needed mass quantities fast.  However, They also contain PEG which can cause extreme Allergic reactions in people who get repeated vaccines such as boosters which will likely be needed next Winter since antibodies fade at about 8 months..

Finally, these first generation mRNA vaccines contain a spike protein made up of syncytin-1 which is also used in women‘s bodies to make placentas .  Researchers are concerned it may make women  infertile for an unknown period of time if antibodies attack it.

Remember, They did not get FDA approval they got Emergency Use Authorization.

DNA vaccines are inherently safer without these compounds And temperature stable for one year.

As of May 2021, Inovio  is now partnering with  a Hong Kong IPO startup to do phase 3 for 4800 vaccine and its variant updated 4802 for China which has hundreds of millions who need a vaccine .  China’s Sinovac was just revealed by their health officials to be Only 50 % effective.

They just signed an agreement to provide plasmids containing  the SPECIFIC DNA for  high single dollars per shot for use in China upon completion of phase 3.  To do phase 3 they need countries without herd immunity which we will soon have if the variants don’t blow by people’s immune systems or the first generation vaccines themselves.

Biden  and Prince Harry and his wife are now pressuring these first generation vaccine makers to give their technologyto third world nations for free.  Since Inovio did not take any government money for phase 3 ; they are not obligated to do so.  I have a 40 year biology  background  and my kid graduated medical school a few  years ago with high honors and is a surgeon. Disclosure we both have Inovio in our retirement accounts.

An American doctor who was chair of infectious diseases in Newark  NJ University hospital visited an elderly family member in India recently and died of Covid despite having received 2 doses of these first generation vaccines.  So it appears that the Indian variant broke  through at least in his case."

This is not an area I’m particularly interested in at the moment. Biotech is tough because it has both a technical, and business component. Most people are under qualified to do any DD on the tech side. 

I’ve noticed INO bulls are typically over enthusiastic about the company. That’s great. But, I almost never see a bear case, or it gets heavily downvoted. I’m just saying that it’s incredibly misleading to say that this will turn into a $52B company at its current state. To put it as blunt as possible: if your thesis can’t handle a modicum of criticism it’s probably a shit investment. I’m happy to either break down why I think it’s shit from the technical, or business side. Which would you rather hear?"

Hell I believe NYT hinted them as White supremacist. Almost like like they did this forum.... anyway planned on jumping back in after GME AMC positions bear fruit.

2021-05-08 12:53:49,wallstreetbets,"NO.  Billionaires are not people.  they clearly go out of their way to convince the masses they are.  Real people would stop long before achieving a billion of net worth and focus on how they can use the fortune to help people.

the lower intelligence ones would focus on giving it away. the smartest would build systems that improve equity and invest in people to up lift them.

Billionaires are reptiles brains that lack any empathy based morality."

I don't give a fuck about your billionaire bad rant, my point was that billionaires get horny too, and they sometimes want to fuck around, without worrying about their spouses.

Plus, ""stopping"" before you reach a billion dolllars in wealth is not really relevant for stock billionaires like Bill Gates, whose net worth is dependent on the value of a company that he hasn't run in almost 20 years.

Finally, as far as the ranks of helpful billionaires go, Bill Gates probably comes close to the top of that list, who actually made his money selling useful shit to society, and then did a lot of legit philanthropy after he left Microsoft."

2021-05-08 04:44:30,wallstreetbets,"1. Endless overseas wars.

2. Spending more money than they bring in. 

3. Consolidating power towards the government and away from the people.

4. Unswerving loyalty to Israel, even at the expense of our own citizens.

5. Pro-central bank and unwilling to reign in the endless printing of fiat.

6. Allowing unaccountable alphabet agencies to do whatever they want and increase in power.

7. Corporatism, regardless of what lip service rhetoric they spew.

8. Taking money from lobbyists and voting accordingly.

D's and R's exist for the purpose of making the people think we have a choice, but in reality the same unelected bureaucrats, banksters, and CEOs are the ones who have the power."

You have that dunning-kruger effect locked down guy."
2021-05-07 23:19:52,wallstreetbets,Because it has no effect whatsoever. Why didn't they denuclearize like Trump say they did? Because it was an obvious lie from America's most beloved con man.
2021-05-08 12:15:21,wallstreetbets,"1.  Obama sure seemed to make a lot of peace treaties and slow methodic troops withdrawals for you to describe it as ""endless wars.""

2.  Deficit always rises under Republicans, and it was on track to being reduced by year under Obama as recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis were the major contributors to increased deficit.  Trump took office after the biggest growth period in modern history and still more than doubled the annual deficit.

3.  The use of executive orders and lack of accountability for presidents in our bipartisan system has always been a problem, Democrats have not consolidated it.  Conversely, Obama created many accountability nets for both government and local law enforcement that Trump ended.

4. Biden just cut weapons to Israel from the end of the Trump admin and also invested over 200M in aid to Palestine to help restore power and water to hospitals, stock up on food.

5. The federal reserve system in the USA has resulted in over 80% of all currency in the USA to be digital, unprinted, non-material backed money.  How?  Because the chief method of money creation is not and has not been in centuries printing but rather loans issued by banks.

6.  Alphabet agencies first described new government agencies under the New Deal, some of the most popular legislature in USA history, but I think perhaps you're talking about militant alphabet agencies?  The ones established under George W Bush as a result of 9/11 ?  Yeah, both sides bad /s, lmao.

7.  Biden is literally attacking big pharma, antitrust laws have been enforced almost exclusively by democrats, and the Trump Tax reform was literally the biggest gift to Corporate that this nation has ever seen.  Trump even raised taxes on the lowest earners while cutting it for corporate.

8.  Hey I know that reading policy is a really difficult thing for you but try checking out H.R. 1 some time.  It might be really hard for you to remember so write that down: H.R.1. It was passed in the House when D took over in 2018 midterms and now its heading through senate since the R lost majority.

All you really outlined was that you're completely ignorant of USA politics."
2021-05-07 21:35:49,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure what makes you think I don't understand it... seems to me like you're just picking a pointless fight over nothing and being an imbecile
2021-05-07 23:21:57,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-08 12:34:24,wallstreetbets,"Obama took the two wars that Bush had and turned them into a war on 7 different fronts.

You talk about the deficit, but the deficit is meaningless when you just jack up the budget to make the deficit look not as bad. Let's talk about the debt and not the deficit. 

Obama and accountability shouldn't be used in the same sentence, this is the same guy who committed assassination via drone strike with impunity.

Biden will never do something meaningful to hurt Israel, giving aid to Palestine while simultaneously being the ""greatest ally"" to Israel is completely pointless. Let's see him do something that will actually end the fascist tactics that Israel is using on the Palestinians.

When I say printing of money I am using it in colloquial, not literal terms. Of course money is mostly digital, that doesn't make the problem of fiat currency go away. If anything it makes the problem worse.

The CIA and NSA existed before Bush, I don't recall any Dem president wanting to reign them in since JFK wanted to do it to the CIA.

If Biden really wanted to attack Big Pharma then maybe he would take away the blank check they got from Trump to be totally immune from any liability for the vaccines they want every person on the planet to get. Biden will never ever do that of course.

Let's wait until HR 1 actually passes and then check back in a few years to see if all these politicians really are getting their donations in a legitimate way, somehow I have doubts that the people benefiting from lobbyists will vote to take away their own cash cow."

It doesn't have to because that's not its core business. It makes money off mutual funds, advisors, 401(K), etc.. Stock trading for Fidelity is a loss leader just like its Fidelity Zero Mutual Funds.

It's a great brokerage to invest serious money with. The mobile app UI is coming there but it's a great brokerage for an 'all in' experience. Its cash management debit card has free ATM withdrawals anywhere globally. Quite useful at times."
2021-05-08 02:52:51,wallstreetbets,"Is it really 'free options' when you lose more trading options because you get worse prices? 1 contract is a 100 shares. Even 1 cent off in share price is more than the 'free option' cost. You don't know what you are missing out on until you try better brokerages.

As for 'free stock trades'. They aren't 'free' when brokerages profit off your orders. The ones that are truly 'free stock trades' are the brokerages without payment for order flow like Fidelity. Also, execution speed at Robinhood is absolute garbage compared to some other brokerages.

That said, the minimal gamified UI is pretty nice to look at on a mobile app. Won't deny that.

But for serious money, I'm staying with the brokerages that manage trillions like Fidelity. I'm in the stock market to make money, not to lose money. Any edge is worth it. During GME fiasco in Jan, my trades at Fidelity got noticeable 'price improvements'. Tens of dollars I would never have gotten had I traded in brokerages like Robinhood due to PFOF."
2021-05-08 06:56:53,wallstreetbets,"No. By law, PFOF has to offer you the item in between the National bid/ask. I’ve also checked on commissioned sites, and the bid/ask is not better. 

You are lot getting a worse price bc of PFOF. Even if you think you could get better execution on the market, we are talking pennies on a bid ask spread vs dollars of commissions.

Honestly, I don’t get why WSB is against PFOF... is it the greatest thing for retail? Probably not. However, most people would not be in the game today if you had to pay oodles to join the game."

2021-05-08 03:41:55,wallstreetbets,"The long you see above means that the stock was purchased and held with the intent that it will grow in value. You are buying and holding for a (long) period, so you are long on the stock. Warren Buffet is long on Apple and Coca-Cola, DFV was long on Gamestop with both shares and calls. Typically purchasing a stock or option with the sole intent to make a trade at a higher price would not be considered being long.

A long position can refer to call options for the same reasons, but would be specified as LEAPS. A retail investor cannot buy LEAPS further than three years. 

All basic financial concepts and terminology can be  googled. Investopedia is an excellent resource, or Bloomberg & Reuters if your firm pays for it.

You can sell or exercise U.S. call options at any time before the expiration date, but like any other security there needs to be a buyer on the other end willing to pay that price. 

Based on your current knowledge I think you would be better off purchasing the stock you want directly as the options pricing model can be confusing.

Those that came up cutting their teeth in the 80s reading books by Lee Iacocca and getting jazzed about Toyota's manufacturing practices don't have the neuroplasticity left to figure out proper remote work, and few have the humility to step down and let their companies move on without them."

2021-05-08 05:47:02,wallstreetbets,"I could listen to you rant for a long time, you make excellent point.

Here’s another one we did not mention: commutes.

I had to travel less than 10 miles to work. Took me anywhere from 45 minutes to upwards of an hour. On rare occasions, RARE occasions, I could manage it in 30 minutes. Like, twice a year or something.

All these people in all their cars spending absolutely stupid amounts of time in traffic. I spent 20 minutes just getting out of the parking lot in the evening. It wasn’t a big parking lot.

Add up all those hours that people don’t lose. 10 hours a week is a very conservative minimum.

Add in all the gas you don’t have to buy.

Add in all the clothes you don’t have to buy to go to work.

Add in all the maintenance on the car that you can save.

Add in toll roads where applicable.

Add in all the stress from driving behind some moron on their smartphone.

Add in accidents (body shops are already complaining that automated vehicles, like a Tesla, will cause fewer and less severe accidents, meaning less money from repairs).

All these are real, tangible costs that people have now not had to worry about for about a year.

For factory jobs you can’t avoid traffic. The production line doesn’t run into your driveway.

For anything that’s an office job it’s a no-brainer. And you raised a great point: having the office be in a fixed place means you have to have people who live closely so that they can get to the office. What if your worker is an expat? They have to move to a new place, with all the hassle that comes with that.

It’s terrible that so many people suffered severe illness or died during this pandemic. On the other hand it’s a great opportunity to make us rethink the we way live and work. You’re certainly right that neighbourhood means something when the people are there. There are cities that are just empty after hours because there’s nobody there to live in that environment. That is not how we work as a social species.

Thank you for a great exchange. I deeply appreciate it."
2021-05-08 00:26:07,wallstreetbets,I lived through 2008 commodity bubble and saw first thing how fucked up that was. This is a even more artificial that that one.
2021-05-07 21:41:50,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, China is facing a similar bubble popping right now. Housing prices, especially in big cities, were increasing exponentially over the last few decades. Because of this a bunch of new housing was built, and now there is more supply than demand, causing prices to start to tumble. The CCP is literally pausing new projects and preventing new housing from being sold in an attempt to prevent the whole bubble from popping and crashing all at once.

However, I don’t think the US will be proactive about it, so they’ll let the system blow up, then bail rich people out and make new rules after we get sent into another economic depression."
2021-05-08 00:28:01,wallstreetbets,Copper has legitimate long term prospects. Its vital to our growing tech. Comparing that to the short term lumber bubble is silly.
2021-05-08 00:32:08,wallstreetbets,These prices are nowhere near long-term equilibrium.
2021-05-08 09:43:39,wallstreetbets,"I mean: hasn’t there been government programs keeping these mortgages afloat? Of course defaults are low right now because the government is printing money and throwing it at anyone with any sort of credit risk.

Once the eviction moratorium expires around the nation, or when rates rise, then we should talk lol"
2021-05-08 01:37:43,wallstreetbets,"I just threw out the 10 hour work week as an example of a sort of 'yeah, I'd LIKE it' (I actually think I wouldn't long term, you can't get anything done in 10 hours and I actually get attached to the systems I run and want to see them serve their users well.) thing.  There are a lot of desires in the business world.  Executives and managers at places like Amazon fulfillment centers desire strongly that their workers were not human beings, and while they might be able to sustain treating people like machines for a little while, we know how this ends.  It ends in bloodshed (where do you think the phrase 'going postal' comes from?  The USPS in the 1990s, after rolling out automated sorting machinery adopted a program to pair human operators with the automated machines, handling the mail the machines couldn't sort.  And they expected the humans to operate like a component of the machine with zero downtime, zero slack time, minimal bathroom or lunch breaks, etc.  Which broke people.  They're human beings are their human needs are BUSINESS needs.  The USPS failed to recognize this, and dozens died in workplace massacres.)

Sometimes desires do translate into immovable forces, I will admit.  Industrial Revolution factory owners did not want to pay adolescents a wage adequate enough to raise a family, and instead of forcing them to, the entire machinery of society organized to enact the largest global change in human reproduction in history and we got the Victorian era.  Remote work certainly isn't a similar degree of desire, I don't think.  If companies had done remote work and seen their business flounder as a consequence, or seen productivity dive by 50% or something like that, sure, it would be a much bigger deal.  But as it is, it opened a lot of eyes to a lot of opportunities.  You mean a company in San Francisco can hire a software engineer with 10 years experience living in Ohio for $90k instead of paying $300k for a local?  The competitor who does that also nets the benefit of not having the negatives of an office aside from price.  Human things like how when a group of humans discuss an idea, the tallest extrovert wins in almost every situation.  Protip: The tallest extrovert rarely has the BEST idea for the business.  Knowing this nets you nothing.... unless you can omit the physicality from the interaction.  Many companies seem to have made the beginners error in remote work of adopting VIDEO calling, but I expect that to die off.  Audio is useful.  Text is better as it is more fungible, but audio is much higher bandwidth and faster.  You just can't save it, reference it, or search it later.  We may revert to almost entirely text interactions because of that last bit.  Search won.  It is the best human-computer interface we've ever developed and it is what people prefer.  But that's a different topic.

I entirely agree about higher wages will have to be offered for companies that insist on on-premise staff.  I think those that pay this premium because they merely prefer it, rather than can make an objective ROI argument for it, will be insolvent before 2030.  I also think this is going to push up wages at jobs that require physical colocation of workers, things like heavy equipment manufacturing.  Light manufacturing might be offloaded to distributed workshops, but no one is going to build a John Deere tractor that weighs 5 tons anywhere EXCEPT in a large purpose-built factory.  And no one is going to want to work those jobs unless the pay is greatly increased when they can work a good paying job from home 'in' a city 1000 miles away.  Or in another country.  Or on another continent.

Only doing remote for new/low level roles is very beginner-grade for remote work, but I could certainly see it starting there, especially for established companies.  This will backfire.  You will end up with senior members of the company, higher ranking, performing very poorly in comparison.  While their newer compatriots are at home with that productivity boost, not getting interrupted, wearing comfortable clothes, eventually someone is going to notice almost none of the projects getting done have the seniors' names on them.

Hybrid is a non-starter.  It's a terrible idea that can not be executed well.  It preserves all the bad parts about offices while sacrificing their few benefits, while abandoning most of the good parts of remote work.  

I'm seriously not engaging in fantasy here.  This is my life.  I had been talking about how remote work was the future for years online, and in 2016 I decided to put my money where my mouth was, I quit my job of 15 years without another job lined up and no intentions of looking for one.  Not an office job, anyway.  Started doing freelance gigs online.  Best decision in my life so far, actually.  Ended up ducking back into an office for about 3 years (company didn't offer remote to 'unproven' folks in their eyes which I can understand), then to remote contract work, then just in the latter half of 2019 I landed my ""unicorn"" job.  100% remote, global team, permanent, high up enough I pick my own technologies and propose my own projects.  Many of my meetings have people on 3 different continents on them.  Customers are spread out just as much (its a B2B managed IT and professional services company, we do lots of different things, I'm in the engineering/hosting ring, like a mini AWS sort of thing, building private clouds, helping companies transition to public ones, etc).  My company did maintain some physical offices in the US, none in states I am less than 500 miles from, and they realized they could close one permanently with the pandemic, and moved to a smaller one for the other.

There are absolutely problems and issues left to be figured out with remote work.  The people who set to doing that with affordable, workable solutions are certainly places to invest IMO.  I can't imagine how you would handle entry level positions where its a persons first job out of college.  I very much grew up online, getting early Internet access in 1990 as a kid (real Internet too, not AOL or Prodigy or Compuserve junk, dialup to a VAX that dumped me at a shell prompt and let me use gopher and telnet and shit), and even I don't know how I would have figured out the whole 'being a decent employee' thing with my first job being fully remote.  At my company the AVERAGE years of experience is 17 years in IT or related field.  And hiring is a very real challenge.  But hey, there are challenges in the traditional way of working too.  Solving them makes money.

I thought fully remote was a long-term fantasy, and up until the pandemic I would have said it was still definitely a decade off before it was widespread.... but the real world has a way of throwing a wrench in things.  Now hopefully we can get on to the fun part with local communities being reborn so the extroverts don't think the world is ending."

2021-05-08 16:06:46,wallstreetbets,"Most of my portfolio is small-cap deep value companies that are against WSB rules to talk about. (Many of them have run up quite a bit and are no longer attractive, but I'm holding them for tax reasons and/or to ride the momentum.) In large caps I'm holding some boring blue-chips like JNJ and BRK.B, which aren't currently at extremely attractive prices. The cigarette companies are, though, as is Intel if you want to underwrite some pretty terrifying execution risks.

I don't know much about pharmaceuticals but scuttlebutt there's some sketchy stuff in ARKG. The rest of your portfolio seems like good, high-quality blue chips."

2021-05-08 16:09:13,wallstreetbets,"Huh, I actually lost almost all my money in precisely what you hold (I’m assuming you’re talking about Pac-Mans. I rotated my profit from other shit into pacmans at February peak and that’s how I lost it all). I’m very disillusioned with them and honestly can’t think of a single one that’s undervalued, but maybe you see something I don’t."
2021-05-07 20:07:41,wallstreetbets,"Do you think they're going to go back to their split-adjusted ATH of 1500? If not, why should they go back to their 52-week high of 70? They don't make money -- they have burned cash every quarter for *two decades straight*. They don't have any exciting new technology; proton exchange membrane fuel cells have been around for 60 years. They only stay alive as a company because of the generosity of the capital markets. That's people like you! You're giving them your hard-earned money by buying stock, and they have spent $1.4 billion of it to get something like $1.3 billion in total revenues -- that number may go down with the restatement, by the way -- and get nice windfalls for Amazon, Walmart and [their executives](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1093691/000104746920002700/a2241489zdef14a.htm#de74701_executive_compensation) along the way. For that they have a current market capitalization of $14.5 billion, more than 10x the *total revenue they have made in their lifetime as a public company*.

I have a financial interest in convincing people to sell their stock. But I also don't want the people on WSB to end up holding the bag!"

I hope, that my research and understanding of the aspects needed to achieve success in the realm of EV/AV will bare fruit. I don’t work in the industry, but I find it fascinating and compelling area of investment that has the potential for massive gains. Thankfully nobody has reached the finish line, as the hopes of BB being an industry leader are still alive. 
And I agree with you, after the whole memestock rallies, the DD has been anemic. I’m willing to keep my bets on my horse BlackBerry. 2 yrs is a long time to wait for significant prospects of revenues to materialize, but I’ve got time."

I just pipe up in these threads because people keep pushing that BB as is, is undervalued which is fundamentally untrue.

I have no position - if I did it would be a short but expect it to trade on a slow drop and sideways for a while, Which means my money could work for me better elsewhere."

I'm no patent attorney but it looks like the filing was this week. Also looks like it might be based on patents filed as early as 2019. Someone smarter than me will have to clarify."
2021-05-07 21:51:45,wallstreetbets,Maybe op posted old news but this is what was in the news this week.
2021-05-07 22:56:06,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha.  Now it makes sense. It’s a filing this week that references multiple patent applications by the same applicants that date back to Nov. 2019. Essentially an extension of one series of inventions that can be applied to multiple uses; in this case, against brain cancer. Like filing a patent on a paper clip in one year and later filing to state it can be used to pick a lock.  This does give it merit"
2021-05-07 20:06:25,wallstreetbets,Oh yea I’m bullish on OLN as well. Hayward will feed off those who stay chlorine as they sell a lot of chlorine as well being the main source for pool companies to get chlorine from directly and for those customers who switch to saltwater Hayward makes those products. Either way it goes Hayward wins. OLN wins as there will still be most people buying chlorine. Saltwater is small percentage of market. OLN also makes Winchester ammo and there’s huge ammo shortage.

2021-05-07 22:44:11,wallstreetbets,I think the COO you mention had just bought lots of stock August 2020 so maybe just sold into strength after. He still has about half of his amount he had in August though. I think. The CEO didn't sell any so I'm not worried. I have $20k in at $71 average now.🚀🚀🚀I change my mind on stocks all the time though so not sure if I'll keep it long.

2021-05-07 22:09:32,wallstreetbets,"No, he most likely didn't. He just spent 7 million dollars buying more shares a few weeks ago. And DFV doesn't swing trade. He's in it for the deep fucking value!"
2021-05-07 21:49:26,wallstreetbets,I trade options in penny stocks while waiting for GME to hit 10k per share
2021-05-07 22:00:36,wallstreetbets,"He bought 50,000 more shares right around this price range. 

YOU probably would have sold by now. But DFV didn't. He held all the way through the $400s, all the way back to $40, then back up to 350, back down to $110, and then bought 50K more shares at around $150/share. 

He's still holding. You have no clue what's going on if you think DFV sold already. He's in it for the long haul.

Plus, Morningstar analysts just rated GME today, and determined it is currently undervalued. You'd have to be a true retard to sell GME right now."
2021-05-07 22:01:54,wallstreetbets,"Have you been paying attention at all?

FYI, GME would have to get near its 3 month low to get below my cost basis and I'm still downvoting your stupid ass theory that's easily disproven by just looking at the screenshots in DFVs post history. Idiot..."

2021-05-07 20:08:21,wallstreetbets,"That´s my assessment as well as it is my biggest position. I do think the management seems to have a longer time horizon playing the 20-year long game rather than the quarterly financial game. Which is a very rare thing to find these days. 

I bought it at $20 avg price thinking that it is 100-150% undervalued but I never expected the price to shoot up to 40 that fast and I think that ultimately hurt its ability to consolidate and move as people now try to get rid of their bags at any price after the sell-off. For me, it is a 3-5 year hold as well. It is a company that will continue to grow and deliver alpha over many years to come and the focus on short-term QoQ reduction in margins is rather short-sighted from most people involved in the stock."

2021-05-08 11:05:13,wallstreetbets,I purchased RIDE around 12 something and sold a month later for a loss at 930ish to purchase more MindMed
2021-05-08 11:08:39,wallstreetbets,"So ~$12.00 per share -> ~$9.30 per share and not 12.00 -> 930.00

2021-05-08 17:07:28,wallstreetbets,A major point missing from this DD that makes me super bullish is that [Katalin Karikó](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katalin_Karik%C3%B3) is pretty much *the* pioneer of mRNA research. She’s the kind of person you want to invest in and is currently a senior VP at BioNTech. She’s been doing for thirty years what others have been working on for two years. That makes me pretty damn confident in BioNTechs ability to possibly pivot to developing a cancer vaccine.
2021-05-08 10:13:24,wallstreetbets,"Right for short term price movement but for mRNA vax this won't impact sales much anytime soon even if it's the worst case scenario of zero protection or compensation for IP for covid vaccines and future boosters and flu+covid vaccines forever and doesn't impact long term outlook much... there was already going to be many more players in the mRNA covid vax field than BNTX/MRNA very soon... curevac and one or two Chinese companies in 2021 and then more in 2022. But BNTX and MRNA have huge leads in manufacturing and clinical trials for the next generation and copycat vaccines aren't trivial... closer to biosimilar antibody therapy than generic small molecule drugs in complexity for approval. Rich countries will stick with what definitely works and is definitely safe in 2022-2023. Look at AZ/J&J concerns. If BNTX or MRNA doesn't have very solid progress beyond covid on that same timescale, they're already falling behind on the next couple generations of mRNA therapies which will be on the market very soon now that safety concerns have proven a billion times over to be much less bad than targeted diseases... Probably will need more work to reduce immune response for mRNA therapy you take regularly for protein replacement, gene therapy to knock down dominant negative gene products, etc. For possible 1/2 dose therapies things are going to go fast. I'd be interested to know how much spike is made by the vaccines and what tissues it's found in... targeted delivery of liposomes is pretty advanced, too.

To the extent IP is stopping copycat inactivated virus or adenovirus vaccines this means a bit more. But overall if investors are bailing because they were banking on covid revenue for many years imo that's a sign mRNA stock prices were undervaluing the future. All that said, the IP landscape is very muddy and it'll be a free for all between lots of players in addition to BNTX and MRNA. My money is on the people who won the first round, but they could easily be big footed by Pfizer or someone else. Re: Pfizer what's not reported this week is that they were in mRNA therapy/vax research just like BNTX and MRNA and they got beat. Plunging a lot more R&D into it now plus manufacturing  expertise this year but still starting from behind."
2021-05-08 10:19:06,wallstreetbets,Those immune therapies are consistently the best selling drugs in the world and improving on then means replacing them with a lower cost (production cost) therapy.
2021-05-08 12:30:09,wallstreetbets,"The idea isn’t to replace them (keytruda, opdivo,etc) but it to find drugs that will augment their efficacy. The problem  with them is that a lot of patients don’t respond to them or that cancers begin to evade their mechanism after time.

This means more combination therapy w expensive drugs, not less expensive drugs"
