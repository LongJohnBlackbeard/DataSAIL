2021-05-05 19:43:19,wallstreetbets,I see that on Webull too. If I look at the hourly chart it adds up to more than the daily chart. I've seen inconsistencies like this on other stocks where the hourly volume does not match the daily. Not sure where you're seeing it but not sure this is specific to GME.

2021-05-05 18:45:36,wallstreetbets,"If you bought 415 puts and spy went to 400, you would have a much higher return than 200%. The implied volatility would definitely increase as the vix would also spike with the drop you would describe.

To put it in context, the 325 strike QQQ puts that expired today started at $0.10/share at the start of yesterday, and peaked at over $2.10/share yesterday. This was a 2000% return. Granted it was 1 day to expiration and a fatty drop. But if spy takes a nice $15 dip in a timely manner of your expiration, it’ll print. 

Only problem, SPY just doesn’t fkn go down."

2021-05-05 18:50:22,wallstreetbets,"Just joking some but I am very heavy silver given the environment. CPI is going to be through the roof. When you have Buffet saying it is a problem and Yellen slipped and was implying it is a problem, it will be very bearish for silver. Especially given the supply/demand fundamentals right now. We might see stocks down, commodities up. Only time will tell."
2021-05-05 18:42:42,wallstreetbets,Your “What if” #1 is false and not how it works.  The days to close their short positions is 2 days. Good luck and try to find a stock that has a longer DTC.  They can easily buy deep ITM calls to negate any losses from their short positions.

2021-05-05 19:03:55,wallstreetbets,"> It is an implantable blood monitor for diabetics that lasts 12 times longer than the only other product on the market. 

There are 3 other (C)GMs on the market right now:  
* Medtronic (Guardian)  
* Dexcom (G5/G6)  
* Abbot (Libre)

I hold SENS as I'm very familiar with Diabetes and the markets, but at least be honest about the competition as well."

2021-05-05 19:15:13,wallstreetbets,sure they have a product that lasts longer but you have to get it surgically implanted under the skin. none of the other competitors have this requirement and can be easily swapped out at home. I don't see this taking off at all.

2021-05-05 19:03:07,wallstreetbets,I'm intrigued. Can you can into more detail how you got to SP 30? To which company are you comparing? I assume the comparison is market cap to market cap.
2021-05-05 19:18:01,wallstreetbets,This will never be able to compete with TNDM/PODD with Dexcom combo in terms of outcomes. G7 is also right around the corner. It would be better to load on DXCM while it’s cheap since it rallies to $430 before every earnings.

2021-05-05 19:51:27,wallstreetbets,"The insertion takes 9mins. It’s very minor. The biggest bull case for SENS is really 2-3 years from now. They’re working on a 365 day sensor that doesn’t have an on-body transmitter. It would communicate directly to your smart phone/watch and eventually a closed loop insulin pump. Think about that freedom for diabetics. Completely subcutaneous, which means no issues with swimming or changing out a sensor bi weekly."
2021-05-05 19:05:30,wallstreetbets,"Dexcom, $DXCM.
They make a current implantable that needs changed out every 10 days."
2021-05-05 19:22:47,wallstreetbets,"I would recommend you be wary with this investment in regards to Options. I use Dexcom, and wouldn't want to use Eversense due to the need for implantation and if something goes wrong you can be out of a CGM for a bit of time. Also, Dexcom doesn't require finger pricks but Eversense requires multiples. They are currently working towards lowering the amount of finger pricks, and Dexcom had them not too long ago but it's definitely a long hold.

Good luck!"

More questions no one asks...👀"
2021-05-05 19:37:43,wallstreetbets,"That right there is the mod list. Let's talk about the mods, can we talk about the mods please, Mac? I've been dying to talk about the mods all day, ok? /u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR, this name keeps coming up over and over and over again. Every day, OIP's daily threads show up. OIP, OIP, I look in the top posts from the week, they're all OIP! So I say to myself I gotta find this guy. I gotta slide into his DM's, I gotta put a message right in his inbox. So I go to the mod list and what do I find out, Mac? What do I find out? There is. no. OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR. The man does not exist, okay?

So I decide ooooh shit buddy, I gotta dig a little deeper. There's no OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR, you gotta be kidding me, I have threads full of OIP! All right, so I start marching my way down to /u/FannyPackPhantom and I knock on her DM's and I say ""Faaanny, Faaaaanny! I gotta talk to you about OIP!"" And when I click on her username, what do I find? There's not a single goddamn user that exists with that name. There is no FannyPackPhantom on Reddit. Mac, half of the mods in this subreddit have been made up. This sub is a goddamn hedge fund."

2021-05-05 18:34:03,wallstreetbets,"Lmao people were really downvoting zjz because he was trying to explain why this is not a conspiracy. Dudes, we lose money cause we’re retarded stop projecting blame. This sub have earn my benefit of the doubt at this point."

2021-05-05 19:41:12,wallstreetbets,It all points to Pepe Silvia
2021-05-05 18:48:12,wallstreetbets,How has the whole gme saga actually turned people into raving lunatics that think everything is an inside job?

2021-05-05 19:33:43,wallstreetbets,Yeah if you wanna be a mod some day a good way is to be an active user who isn’t a total shithead.
2021-05-05 19:23:24,wallstreetbets,"It means they have been active on Reddit as users from a long time. Both u/darkbyte, u/richtofin115 and u/fannypackphantom are regular people like you and me. Only they have proven worthy of extra responsibility"
2021-05-05 19:27:12,wallstreetbets,"No it just means that they came from browsing here, probably not great wording. Reddit has never made us add anybody. The Reddit admin is our adopt an admin, he's a good dude."

September calls for a 50% realized loss just an FYI. Also it would be a net debit meaning you would have to pay the difference between the two.

Rolling out yours to Jan could be delaying the inevitable. You could lower your strike for a net debit, but it could also be throwing more money at the same issue. If this downtrend is to stay, we are in for several months of red pain. 

Another option is to average down on the same calls. I've done that a couple of times and came out alive. It all depends on how bullish you are on AAPL."
2021-05-05 18:28:21,wallstreetbets,Don’t you have to own shares in order to sell covered calls? I currently don’t own any Apple shares just holding onto some September contracts

People are going to lose money and be wrong, that's a hard lesson to learn, but its ultimately good, retail traders will evolve.  

This is the government protecting themselves from a speculative surge of bankruptcy filings and whatnot when ""unsophisticated"" retail traders blow all their money on bad investments.  

Robinhood might be terrible, but killing what they do for the sake of ""protecting investors"" is just further dividing retail and institutional investors for the sake of saving their own ass.

2021-05-05 18:41:20,wallstreetbets,The fact that RKT has traded in the mid-low 20s for a very long time and a majority of stocks being held by shareholders were probably around $22+ for cost average makes it very hard to believe that a majority of shareholders are actually selling at a LOSS with how much the price has dropped to after hours. Especially with the earnings only being a 0.01 miss and nearly all other indicators being very bullish for the company. I'm currently holding 1100 shares in the low 20's and will continue to hold. #shortsgonnashort #keephodlin
2021-05-05 18:22:49,wallstreetbets,God damn those calls are worthless tomorrow
2021-05-05 18:51:05,wallstreetbets,"Movie ticket sales have declined steadily since 2003, the entire industry has been dying for nearly 2 decades as theaters jack prices to stay alive.  AMC enjoyed the meme pump and sold shares to pay off debt, but that will only prolong the inevitable.  I bet people in the 40's never thought movies would overtake plays either, but AMC doesn't have a pivot like GME, BB, or NOK do, it was pumped because it was cheap and people are greedy AF. Cruise lines are a much better recovery play, I never could wrap my head around the AMC play."
2021-05-05 18:06:06,wallstreetbets,sounds like I got some lotto tickets now 🙃

These markets and companies just dont make any logical sense In my opinion. They missed earnings by a penny and that warrants a 12-15% devaluation? Insanity. Im out!

2021-05-05 18:07:27,wallstreetbets,Chip shortage is good because it's to do with the high demand and not the supply(consumer supply is low but amd still increased its output year to year) we just consume more . Amd will be booming since their sh.t is gonna always be sold out.
2021-05-05 17:23:46,wallstreetbets,100% agree. Bought another 125 today and averaged to $81.50.

2021-05-05 18:00:00,wallstreetbets,Didn't manufacturers just come out and say that the chip shortage is in fact WORSE than we thought and not likely to get better anytime soon?
2021-05-05 17:17:06,wallstreetbets,You know what’s even better? GME 🚀🚀
2021-05-05 17:46:13,wallstreetbets,"I'm high on AMD personally, but I didnt buy them today, I sold all my shares in the high 80s.
They've struggled to maintain a price above 85, with fears of semiconductor shortages, and all tech down right now, they could keep sliding in the short term.

Long term I do think it's a good hold an buy.
But im just a super amateur, so its probably best not to listen to me."

2021-05-05 18:49:06,wallstreetbets,This is awesome!
2021-05-05 17:37:01,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip just did the drop is odd some paper handed idiots
2021-05-05 18:11:40,wallstreetbets,12k now. thank you shorts.
2021-05-05 16:52:14,wallstreetbets,"I almost started a Dutch Bros. 20 years ago. I really wish I had, those places print money."
2021-05-05 17:38:47,wallstreetbets,"They own the drive thru coffee market in Oregon.....lots of them in AZ, too.  Something to watch."
2021-05-05 18:08:36,wallstreetbets,I go there literally everyday and get 2+ drinks pretty much each time
2021-05-05 18:06:31,wallstreetbets,"In Oregon a few weeks ago... Dutch bros everywhere you looked and lines out the ass. 

Same thing happening here in Vegas... Starbucks right down the street 0 line Dutch bros 2 lines of cars at least 20 deep constantly. 

Interesting to see how this pans out."
2021-05-05 16:46:30,wallstreetbets,Respect to you bro.. i’m down 20k from 33k its my biggest lesson
2021-05-05 16:45:06,wallstreetbets,After hours is a killer
2021-05-05 16:45:36,wallstreetbets,Why leave $4.15 ? For a cup of coffee ?
2021-05-05 16:48:25,wallstreetbets,Tip: try to diversify what you invest. Hope this correction could end sooner than later and you can reverse your situation. Good luck bro!!!
2021-05-05 16:43:52,wallstreetbets,Ooo fuck yeah spread it
2021-05-05 17:44:58,wallstreetbets,You still got 14k. This is very premature
2021-05-05 16:54:16,wallstreetbets,"I see your problem, its robinhood"
2021-05-05 16:48:24,wallstreetbets,I haven’t learned anything yet 🙃
2021-05-05 16:49:29,wallstreetbets,To pay my monthly dues to my wife's boyfriend.
2021-05-05 17:01:56,wallstreetbets,Hell yea why put that much in Robinhood
2021-05-05 17:30:46,wallstreetbets,He is worthless 😂
2021-05-05 16:42:35,wallstreetbets,It destroyed everything but missed EPS by 1 penny. Ridiculous
2021-05-05 16:42:16,wallstreetbets,At least it’s shares and not options.
2021-05-05 16:44:33,wallstreetbets,"You have shares, keep on holding brother. If you had options I would feel really really bad for you. Like how I feel bad for me"
2021-05-05 16:44:35,wallstreetbets,Man I’m ducked ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
2021-05-05 16:45:42,wallstreetbets,Just keep buying the dip.
2021-05-05 16:42:42,wallstreetbets,Nice Inverse gains dude!!!
2021-05-05 16:43:49,wallstreetbets,Bought in this morning. Gonna buy the dip as well
2021-05-05 17:39:09,wallstreetbets,"ANALYSTS UPGRADED ESTIMATES 11 TIMES

let that sink in

11
times

and now it misses by 1 penny 🙂"
2021-05-05 16:54:18,wallstreetbets,Hodl
2021-05-05 16:56:33,wallstreetbets,"I bought at the dip in addition to my options yesterday. I think we could see potential like the last earnings, even though we didn't see a surprise overage. Nearly 92%Y/Y is pretty damn good."
2021-05-05 16:42:39,wallstreetbets,Earnings were massive. Hold the line.
2021-05-05 18:11:42,wallstreetbets,"New retard here... I will hold the line. Seriously, I want to experience some gladiator movie battle fight type shit here."
2021-05-05 16:50:34,wallstreetbets,We are starting a war all in on RKT
2021-05-05 17:10:32,wallstreetbets,"Agreed this is ridiculous I’m still holding 700@27 I’m not selling ever, we need to come together and fu*k the shorts!!"
2021-05-05 17:39:51,wallstreetbets,"That’s it, buying puts from here on out!"
2021-05-05 16:43:08,wallstreetbets,At least you were pretty consistent in averaging down. That's something.
2021-05-05 16:53:00,wallstreetbets,Wallstreet wins everytime. We got fucked again.
2021-05-05 16:45:09,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-05-05 16:51:15,wallstreetbets,Covered calls time!
2021-05-05 17:16:32,wallstreetbets,Whats your next moves?? Im down 5k
2021-05-05 18:06:03,wallstreetbets,"Just hold onto the shares, sell covered calls, and buy more RKT with premiums you earn."
2021-05-05 18:33:13,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I feel better about my shit investments thst are down $200"
2021-05-05 17:23:12,wallstreetbets,They announced a buyback so... that means the stock must tank lol
2021-05-05 16:43:26,wallstreetbets,Hold
2021-05-05 16:53:49,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip!
2021-05-05 17:42:38,wallstreetbets,Maybe the whole markets about to go. That treasury warning and the Yellen statement.
2021-05-05 16:44:51,wallstreetbets,rEkt
2021-05-05 16:45:56,wallstreetbets,Wsb does it again.... ouch 🤕
2021-05-05 18:02:14,wallstreetbets,Fair value for this share is 10$. Sorry for you...but they are not bank nor tech like sq. Better get out.
2021-05-05 17:04:57,wallstreetbets,i would not worry since it is shares. Im with you. I got shares too and I'll just average down if needed.
2021-05-05 17:13:08,wallstreetbets,welcome to the club!!
2021-05-05 17:26:10,wallstreetbets,Oof
2021-05-05 17:33:34,wallstreetbets,Poor unfortunate soul
2021-05-05 17:36:32,wallstreetbets,Too bad you didn't sell covered calls. You wouldve lowered your cost avg
2021-05-05 18:03:00,wallstreetbets,As our boy Buffer says- no moat. Many mortgages businesses now a days
2021-05-05 18:03:07,wallstreetbets,"PEW PEW. Wish granted. In all seriousness, I hope it turns around and you can recoup some losses or reap the 6 year of tax offsets."
2021-05-05 18:35:02,wallstreetbets,Down 20% ah 😂 😂 😂
2021-05-05 19:14:55,wallstreetbets,you yoloed at top
2021-05-05 19:17:26,wallstreetbets,Did the accountant have puts?
2021-05-05 19:42:33,wallstreetbets,I would but based on your investing sense you probly couldn't afford the ammo.
2021-05-05 17:13:48,wallstreetbets,just flip your phone upsidedown. oh wait this isn't a graph
2021-05-05 17:48:21,wallstreetbets,1 cent makes the stock go down 15 percent that’s odd
2021-05-05 17:58:34,wallstreetbets,Holy shit 36 impressive
2021-05-05 16:47:56,wallstreetbets,Did you miss last week? Most tech stocks beat and still dropped.
2021-05-05 16:44:44,wallstreetbets,All that was already priced in.
2021-05-05 17:11:52,wallstreetbets,He’s a responsible degenerate.
2021-05-05 18:31:42,wallstreetbets,Keep on holding brother. They probably won't come back. But they might.
2021-05-05 16:46:58,wallstreetbets,Hodl your shares bro.
2021-05-05 16:57:04,wallstreetbets,"You have shares, just keep buying"
2021-05-05 19:33:25,wallstreetbets,Your shares are fine broski - just take a chill
2021-05-05 18:11:37,wallstreetbets,Seriously.... all that while home sales are down due to low inventory.... RKT will continue to kill it for years to come
2021-05-05 17:18:23,wallstreetbets,LONG HODL
2021-05-05 16:44:21,wallstreetbets,Earnings were priced in.
2021-05-05 17:59:06,wallstreetbets,I think it's more that WSB loses everytime.
2021-05-05 18:10:34,wallstreetbets,Stocks don’t move in reaction to public consensus estimate but compared to Wall Street whisper numbers.
2021-05-05 18:09:54,wallstreetbets,They are at $20 and made $.89 in one quarter. Thry could easily make $2 EPS which would mean a 10 P/E. Severely undervalued.
2021-05-05 17:51:26,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣
2021-05-05 16:47:37,wallstreetbets,Why wasnt missing EPS by 1c already priced in if everything’s priced in?
2021-05-05 18:42:54,wallstreetbets,"Naww I'm counting my losses tmrw whatever they are.
Glad I grabbed June Calls too."
2021-05-05 16:49:51,wallstreetbets,If they were priced in then why 12% tank
2021-05-05 18:35:03,wallstreetbets,My point is kind of what is the moat ? Either go with a bank or go with fintech like sq. Anyone can provide mortgage now a days. Sofi and all are doing mortgage
2021-05-05 16:49:30,wallstreetbets,Exactly
2021-05-05 17:16:58,wallstreetbets,Because it missed them
2021-05-05 18:51:51,wallstreetbets,RKT has lower rates than most and when you have a 200K loan then you want as low a rate as possible.
2021-05-05 17:23:54,wallstreetbets,"By a penny?

Lmao, give me a break - we living in a simulation or something"
2021-05-05 17:29:23,wallstreetbets,Stocks with blowout earnings and exceeding expectations have been getting destroyed. What makes you think RKT is any different?
2021-05-05 17:06:28,wallstreetbets,Wtf is wrong with you
2021-05-05 17:05:26,wallstreetbets,"Deadclown: I demand you forward this to my registered broker assigned to me.

Everyone else: LOL"
2021-05-05 16:46:22,wallstreetbets,"Repeatedly blasting a level 1 customer service rep for failing to do something they can’t isn’t cool, be respectful of other people.

Looks like they gave you a number to call in their last message you posted and you ignored it."
2021-05-05 19:44:01,wallstreetbets,"Dude, they told you where to find the proxy rights.

That's verification that they have the shares... dumbass  lmaooo"
2021-05-05 18:13:57,wallstreetbets,The GME site just said you just need proxy documents and the guy told you how to access them in the very first email. What more do you want?
2021-05-05 16:55:44,wallstreetbets,I am beginning to think the whole market is fraudulent...
2021-05-05 17:04:12,wallstreetbets,The constant good news says it all
2021-05-05 16:41:33,wallstreetbets,At $5/share I am with you BIGLY. Let’s let it fill that gap
2021-05-05 16:41:21,wallstreetbets,My average is 13 +
2021-05-05 16:41:02,wallstreetbets,Holy shit every stock here is a squeeze play now jfc
2021-05-05 18:00:10,wallstreetbets,"Hedging is a valid investing strategy used by many investors. Shorting is a NATURAL way for the market mechanism of price discovery to function. BNGO ( which I own) is not curing cancer, they are working on genetic testing (I believe). If you would like to learn more about the way the market functions (or is supposed to) I would highly recommend investopedia, they have saved me a lot of money."
2021-05-05 16:58:10,wallstreetbets,It is... there is no reason that this stock shouldn’t be $15-$20 a share right now. The hedge funds have scared the paper hands out and now they are in control while the volume is decreasing.
2021-05-05 16:44:14,wallstreetbets,I plan on holding this long term (5+ years). It just has the oppurtunity to be squeezed at this point in time. Check out the short interest and the fundamentals of the company and you’ll see. 🚀🚀
2021-05-05 17:29:15,wallstreetbets,"It’s a company with some promising tech that has like 8M in revenue and a 1B+ market cap. It was sub $1 a year ago, ran to 15, and now people wanna say it’s ‘underpriced’ at $6. Yeah, that one?

I like a hyper growth name as much as the next retard but market is not letting that happen right now. Long term hold? Maybe. Be prepared to average down. Just sick of seeing EVERYTHING on here pitched as a squeeze play. WSB used to just ruin individual stocks but now we’ve run an entire stock market concept into the ground.

...it was worth it tho"
2021-05-05 17:34:21,wallstreetbets,It is undervalued. I will remember your dumb fucking comment when earnings roll out in a month.
2021-05-05 18:09:58,wallstreetbets,Wish you nothing but good luck and fortune. You have the blessing of someone who told DFV (on more than one occasion) that GME was a bad idea so I’m pretty sure I have like a reverse Midas touch thing going
2021-05-05 16:37:23,wallstreetbets,Bye.
2021-05-05 18:10:48,wallstreetbets,go away
2021-05-05 17:55:54,wallstreetbets,Ok!
2021-05-05 16:35:44,wallstreetbets,what is it ?
2021-05-05 16:39:52,wallstreetbets,What's up with that stonk?
2021-05-05 17:13:39,wallstreetbets,"Closed my position today. Ups and downs, maybe a decent swing trade every now and then but pretty shitty now"
2021-05-05 17:03:28,wallstreetbets,Not written by a true Ape ... garbage
2021-05-05 16:33:38,wallstreetbets,This seems to be insanely inaccurate.
2021-05-05 16:33:35,wallstreetbets,Anyone else think the graphics is like watching the dot race at a baseball game?
2021-05-05 16:32:59,wallstreetbets,RIP to my fellow Rocketmen and women out there. Why do the gods hate us so.
2021-05-05 16:40:08,wallstreetbets,"As someone whose holding CLOV, my heart goes out to the RKT-Teers. I won’t slander or ridicule them 😔🥲"
2021-05-05 16:35:51,wallstreetbets,I certainly don't believe this. AMC promo literally had a damn plane go over nyc. And all I see. Literally hardly hear about the rest. Naw this aint it.
2021-05-05 16:36:02,wallstreetbets,GME bag holders are mega triggered.
2021-05-05 17:05:09,wallstreetbets,We can’t mentionGME on wallstreetbets without it getting taken down so this is false.

2021-05-05 16:46:27,wallstreetbets,Just a silly bet. Take a look at the technicals and study why you lost.
2021-05-05 16:47:12,wallstreetbets,"Ehh the plane has nothing to do with the WSB daily thread and nobody ever mentions AMC in the daily thread.  It was pretty flat today so no real reason to mention it.  Not really surprised by it.  Corsair, PLTR, AMD, TSLA and RKT are WSB favorites from 2020 or before so they get lots of love and Peloton had massive 15% drop which is newsworthy."
2021-05-05 16:38:26,wallstreetbets,agree this is not good data and should be sent to the gulag
2021-05-05 16:53:50,wallstreetbets,What does a plane in NYC have to do with this sub tho.
2021-05-05 17:30:13,wallstreetbets,"Can you read the visual?? It clearly states tickers mentioned in the daily thread, which GME is constantly."
2021-05-05 16:42:21,wallstreetbets,AMD TO THE MOOOOON
2021-05-05 17:05:34,wallstreetbets,Shut your whore mouth.
2021-05-05 17:27:58,wallstreetbets,What is a silly bet? Rkt is undervalued. Plain and simple. In time it will correct itself. Anyone yoloing FDs is retarded yes but this is a solid company. They just made 2.4 Billion in EBITDA in a single quarter.
2021-05-05 17:51:22,wallstreetbets,Yeah fool. People that own or have gme are tired of this busted ass subreddit. Phony ass gay mods.
2021-05-05 17:30:51,wallstreetbets,I agree it’s a solid company. But that doesn’t mean I can’t make money on the reflexive nature of earnings.
2021-05-05 17:54:54,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I was thiiiis close to selling this afternoon knowing that it would dip but didnt want to take the loss on my CCs.
2021-05-05 16:43:55,wallstreetbets,Wow $700 you big spender
2021-05-05 19:49:51,wallstreetbets,You really are retarded?
2021-05-05 16:51:27,wallstreetbets,Every share counts my friends. We are all apes. Some apes have more bananas than others
2021-05-05 16:49:34,wallstreetbets,"Watch the magic happen and those contracts gain massive value

Op sells them

They finish ITM

Contract buyer excersized them and he's assigned.

He becomes a big spender"
2021-05-05 16:49:32,wallstreetbets,I’m working on it lmao
2021-05-05 16:59:07,wallstreetbets,"On reflection this was more for small bets, but I might see y’all again in a few months 🤞"
2021-05-05 17:31:41,wallstreetbets,"looked more into contract assignments, but why would I sell them? It goes green I just buy more options farther out and vibe right? 
Edited: clarity and cause the r word"
2021-05-05 16:38:59,wallstreetbets,Didn't they just release an outstanding 1st quarter?  Why would $RKT tank when the numbers are good.  My smooth brain doesn't understand.
2021-05-05 16:42:16,wallstreetbets,This is a war everyone buy
2021-05-05 16:32:37,wallstreetbets,"Good thing I sold calls.

Too bad I own a lot of shares though."
2021-05-05 16:33:39,wallstreetbets,Buy at after hours??
2021-05-05 16:46:17,wallstreetbets,"My RKT 20 calls are for Jan 21 2022🤠, maybe buy some more tomorrow..."
2021-05-05 16:38:21,wallstreetbets,"I added 100 shares before closing..I definitely belong here, thank God for Proper Number 12"
2021-05-05 16:32:29,wallstreetbets,Run the red light to get to green.  This is a buy signal
2021-05-05 16:31:04,wallstreetbets,"Yup, the usual after hours scare play."

2021-05-05 19:30:12,wallstreetbets,"I’m doubling down tomorrow 
I’ve got no more fucks to give"
2021-05-05 16:29:41,wallstreetbets,Average WSB moment
2021-05-05 16:40:05,wallstreetbets,"This is why you should have bought calls expiring next Friday, not this Friday."
2021-05-05 16:29:50,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for holding my bags. I will PUT some more in your hands, excellent work.

Edit: keep downvoting pls, I have made my money on RKT hype and its your money, thanks bagholders."
2021-05-05 16:43:55,wallstreetbets,Which app is this?
2021-05-05 19:02:55,wallstreetbets,"If you mean losing the war, then yes."
2021-05-05 19:25:37,wallstreetbets,It is you have what it needs to fight your war
2021-05-05 16:47:50,wallstreetbets,Earnings were priced in. $3/share drop for missing earnings by $0.01 is oversold.
2021-05-05 16:44:28,wallstreetbets,Same smoothie
2021-05-05 16:35:05,wallstreetbets,LOL Same fucking position here man.
2021-05-05 17:18:21,wallstreetbets,THIS is the way
2021-05-05 16:41:59,wallstreetbets,Wait can you explain?? Cuz I'm scared
2021-05-05 16:40:25,wallstreetbets,Did it work?
2021-05-05 19:48:55,wallstreetbets,Anyone buying calls that expire in two days definitely belong here.
2021-05-05 16:30:53,wallstreetbets,diamond filled bags? thanks!
2021-05-05 16:52:35,wallstreetbets,That’s Webull.
2021-05-05 17:41:35,wallstreetbets,"That’s enough to make it drop off like that, immediately after hours? That just doesn’t make much sense for a sell off that quick. Their numbers weren’t that bad I’m smooth brain but it seems weird especially with all the hype behind it"
2021-05-05 17:16:53,wallstreetbets,"It was immediately shorted as soon as the earnings report came out. There are big players shorting it in AH. It did over 3.5 mil volume so far AH, when in the past you'd be lucky sometimes to see 3.5 mil for a whole day. This is not a reaction to earnings, this is shorting."
2021-05-05 17:20:53,wallstreetbets,nope. i'm buying more calls tomorrow :)
2021-05-05 16:39:37,wallstreetbets,Lol so many downvotes from RKT zombies come on meme army get me to -100 downvotes achievment 😂
2021-05-05 18:06:33,wallstreetbets,"I honk what dropped it more than anything was the lowered projected amount of money they’ll make per loan, and a possible increase of interest rates which will deter many from refinancing."
2021-05-05 17:22:55,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, this would have happened with earnings being whatever."
2021-05-05 17:55:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm buying all the calls tomorrow. Tomorrow is going to be the day to get your positions open.

Remember last time, it wasn't earnings that caused the price to moon to the 40's, it was a special dividend that they announced because they were PISSED shorts were holding the price down.

Rocket Companies won't take this price action lying down. They have a $1 bil buy back locked and loaded that they haven't used at all, A special dividend already happened once in a similar situation.

This is it. this going to be the best opportunity to get in the RKT for a while."
2021-05-05 17:29:43,wallstreetbets,I probably will too if the price is right
2021-05-05 17:58:38,wallstreetbets,Fellow put holder checking in: 33% max gain hit on my debit spread opened right before market close.

How does Dan Gilbert recover the money he lost from this price action?

A. He can buy back class A shares, which costs him money.

B. He can issue another special dividend, which fucks with the shorts big time and allows him to pay himself. costs him nothing.

C. he can do nothing."

Edit: to clarify on the restrictions on my account so some of you can avoid it. 

As a young investor 3 months ago I flipped a couple of stocks for a quick profit. Unbeknownst to me that’s the textbook definition of “day trading” and RH doesn’t like that.

2021-05-05 18:14:28,wallstreetbets,Exactly. If GME is rightfully worth $20 or $100 due to positive speculation is a moot point. The excitement should be solely focused on a short squeeze jumping up the price. This sort of news should only serve to make people feel better should the short squeeze not happen and hopefully they’ll recoup their costs in some years when GME is a stronger company stock.

2021-05-05 18:25:38,wallstreetbets,Not saying it does. I’m saying an independent body upgrading the credit worthiness of a company clearly signifies that it is less risky than it once was. The rating may be for bonds but it is speaking to the company’s ability to pay its debts which is certainly positive for the company. An increased credit rating can make a stock price go up. No one is saying it’s the reason it is trading at $160 but it isn’t immaterial.

The hedge-fund selling was most concentrated in the communications-services and information-technology sectors, according to the BofA data — i.e., the tech winners that have thrived during the COVID-19 pandemic.

cryptocurrency is bullshit. Imagine thinking that a currency worth 60k per coin that takes 1 week to process a transaction has any real-world use.

It's also a pump and dump ""investment"" that has no place on this sub. Fuck dogecoin and BTC dipshits.

**To everyone with alt-coins:** You made a shitty decision. Accept that and stop telling us that your shitty coin has any significance other than as a vessel for yet another tik tok loser to pump and dump.

Also wtf has happened here? Every WSB hiatus I take there's some new bullshit happening I can only assume is because of GME.

2021-05-05 17:56:54,wallstreetbets,Most people here need to realize that there's a reason many stocks are shorted. They think that because GME squeezed because it was shorted but it was because it was shorted AND the company was making improvements that showed a lot of promise.

2021-05-05 16:12:03,wallstreetbets,"Why am I so greedy! Should’ve cashed the OCGN options when I was up 100%, but nope. I’m a moron."

2021-05-05 18:24:43,wallstreetbets,Get rid of MRNA and/or BNTX.  It is a virtual certainty that Moderna will waive the patent to their mRNA vaccine which will also force BNTX hands as well as those 2 companies used the same technology for their vaccines.  The covid vaccines were the first medications released by both of these companies and while BNTX and MRNA has other vaccines and immunotherapies  in clinical trials the only other meds close to release is another covid vaccine for both.  MRNA has a CMV vaccine in phase 3 but even when (and if) it gets released it’s not going to be a money maker.  The Covid vaccine and its booster shots was the best source of income for many years for both companies.  Notice that JNJ and Astra Zeneca did not have its stock drop on Biden’s news but MRNA & BNTX both drop between 25-30$ immediately after Biden asks for a waiver.  The reason is that JNJ and AZ vaccines uses an older technology with adenoviruses where BNTX and MRNA uses the newer safer and more efficacious tech.

It feels like we are nearing the mirror opposite of the stupid Jan/Feb overpricing of all growth.   Very few places that seem to be working well, but these areas are working well for the time being on the long side.    Lots of spots look cheap, but are they going to get a lot cheaper?   The lack of insider buying in all industries has me particularly concerned still."

2021-05-05 16:01:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, there are big players Altria Group/Constellation brands with big pockets. The risk on SNDL is market strategy and fast growth.

If you'd like to come up on stage in discord and ask questions @Plechazunga_#4790.

It might be hard to post a summary of every question that gets asked, but I'll try.

Edit: Started the list too late, missed a few at the beginning.

Edit 2: This is not me answering by the way, just transcribing.

Edit 3: Reorganized the order, top is most recent.

Edit 4: That's a wrap! I may have missed a few questions that weren't really questions. Hope this format is easy to read.

Questions | Answers
:--|:--
How do you feel about the toxicity? When you lose money and get bullied for it? | THAT'S WALLSTREETBETS!! If you lose money and you get memed on, that's part of the community. If you don't like it, go to r/investing or another sub if you want sympathy. (another mod) I hate the loss porn, and I want to see everyone win, but anyone that loses and wants to share with everyone because they thing it's funny, that's on them. 
Do you have legal ownership of the name? | Reddit and Jaime are fighting over the trademark to the WSB name, and the copyright to the logo belongs to Bawse1
How do you feel about your sub multiplying by 10x? | That's awesome, that's really cool. 
Does the discord make money? From the boosts | Discord (the company) makes money, we don't make money. We don't get anything from the boosts.
(discord-specific question) I really appreciate you guys adding new channels specific for things that are blowing up | We do, we try our best to keep our fingers on the pulse, but if there's something bad going down, please let us know, and also we don't want to subdivide things too far
Was Martin Shkreli really a mod? | Yeah, a long time ago, great times
Other discord channels are full of people who just got banned on the WSB channel and they say they didn't do anything | Yeah, we're pretty lax, but there's a reason why people get banned over and over again. We'll look into it, but everyone says they haven't broken the rules even though they do, multiple times. (more stuff about one person's particular ban)
During GME, were you ever contacted by law enforcement | No, they would have to subpoena reddit, and even then, it's not like that (something else I missed)
What if reddit has to shut down reddit for whatever reason? | Discord will always be here, but admins are really for us, they included us in their superbowl commercial, they're always talking to us and helping us out. We now have our own channels directly with discord and reddit now, we won't just disappear, there will be a conversation.
Do you have any roadmap or community plans to make this into a bigger brand or organization? Is there going to be a website? | Um, we're just here for the community, we don't think it will really exist off reddit. It's so big because people are on reddit and coming to WSB.
Do you have any contingencies are in place in case admins abuse their power? | When the old mods were trying to steal the sub, we were out of the loop and that's what was 
Have you ever had to kick off an admin for whatever reason? | Yeah, definitely, absolutely. There were a bunch of people growing the sub, then the people who were at the top just swooped in to take advantage to take all the credit, all the profits. We had them formally removed because that's not what we're about, and it's against our ethics to do that kind of shit. There's a lot of controversy around it, but ultimately we did what we thought was best for the subreddit. Reddit admins actually went through a process to figure out what was going on and did everything they can to make sure everything was above board.
Is WSB coin a real thing? | No, it has nothing to do with us, we don't have any partnerships or any of that shit. We're independent, we're going to stay that way.
What was your decision that you allowed a crypto for a second but removed it | It was a very controversial decision and unpopular with other mods. It's not that I hate crypto, but there's a lot of noise that comes with it and it'll drown out everything else, it's not worse than GME, but it's a can of worms and not all up to me. We definitely don't bow to crypto.
What's your opinion of trading a trend? | That's what our users love to do, but they can do other shit too. We are just trying to keep it a civil place. Mods are here to moderate, not to give our personal opinions. 
Are you for more public involvement in the stock market? Do you promote it? | I'm for it, but we don't promote it. This is just a place for people to come and hang out and talk about stocks. There's no specific thing we're trying to push or anything like that.
How long have you been involved in the WSB sub? | 6 years
Is the sub being used in any way now that you've grown and have a large audience? | We don't use the sub, it's against how we feel, to use the platform to manipulate or pump a stock, anything here is from the users, and if there's anything here trying to manipulate our users, we try to stop that, and we do a good job, but there's no agenda
How much have you guys made percentage-wise in 1 year | ""100"", ""I've made about 300"", ""I do okay, I don't trade memestocks""
Are most mods bulls or bears? | We just trade whatever makes us money
Do any of you trade stocks and not just options? Don't hold them long term? | Most of us just trade options there's no limits up to individuals what they trade. You'll never see us pushing a stock or telling you what to or not to buy
Did gleep die? | ""I'm gleep"" - gleep
I've been banned for a YOLO post but I have proof | Okay I'm (missed the name) message me the proof
What's going on with VC and people coming in yelling ""this coin to the moon"" | It's tough, were you here during the crash in 2020? The amount of people (cut off)
You don't count GME as a pump right now? They're literally going on other subs and encouraging people to buy| Yeah, I don't know. We do ban people when they brigade by linking to a WSB thread telling people to upvote and ban them but there's also a lot of legitimate interest in the stock.
Do you feel responsible? | If we notice something being a pump, we will definitely remove that person, but if you lose money, that's your fucking problem, that's on you.
A lot of people want to private the sub but if you do that then it dies | I agree, we want to be inclusive of everyone unless they're being excessively obnoxious
A lot of people think the paper trading competition is great unless they're the ones getting banned, then they're on the other side | New people can be annoying but once they settle down they'll be great. I'm sure a lot of you when you first came you were really annoying but now you're here and now you're ""oldfriends""
The influx of new people we've seen due to the popularity of the GME craze will just be a very long fad like a year long and once it goes away you'll see the old WSB come back | I think a lot of people just don't like new people, many of us is like that, there's a lot of great people here. 
As a mod of the discord/subreddit, what's the concern that you're trying to voice and what's your goal | I just want to see what you guys are up to, we don't have an agenda just here to answer any complaints people have
I saw someone talking about the BECKY index and adding PTON to it, and that was nostalgic, and I can't even remember the last time I saw someone talk about that | Yeah that (I forgot what the rest of the answer was)
(mod) What do people come to the sub for? DD? Follow people trading? Pump and dumps? I think people come for shitposts. I don't like shitposts. There's a lot of shit I don't like but I leave it up because people like it. Let the votes decide | (user) It's the memes that people remember, stuff like Ironyman
(mod) We really do try to keep that stuff out, we're not bought by anyone and try and stay clean of the crypto stuff | (user) I've been a mod of r/pokemongo and I know how it feels (something about not being able to stand pokemon casuals)
(mod asking user) Okay but what do you want us to do about it? | (another user) Everyone's become focused on this get rich quick mentality but 
(mod asking user) Okay but the sub? | I feel like the average user is actually financially illiterate, I can't read anything without rolling my eyes
(mod asking user) What is the sub to you? | (something about a guy who got suspended for posting escort sites)
Why don't you remove all GME and AMC posts |We're not promoting it, we're not holding it back. You don't really want us cultivating content don't you?
Why not increase the $1B minimum limit since you want to eliminate P&Ds | To what? $2B? $5B? You want to be a blue chip investor?
Why not just actually ban AMC and GME tickers since they hate you and fuck 'em? | Nah, we don't care if they hate us 
hi | ok
Would you pay the 2% fee for index funds? | Just get one with a low MER, what are you talking about
How many of you have autism? (in a weird voice)| Uh, I don't...

I hope this Q&A format is alright"
2021-05-05 15:57:01,wallstreetbets,Just one question. Wen Moon?
2021-05-05 16:04:16,wallstreetbets,What’s up with the 35 new mods
2021-05-05 16:31:27,wallstreetbets,"I'm listening but don't want to talk.

If a common complaint is new ppl asking stupid questions then would you consider a daily stupid question thread? As well as moderating it enough so that helpful people are heard?

Also, someone mentioned an acknowledgement of a certain level of responsibility, so how about some guidance now and then. Especially during p&d times, just to remind the newbs to take their fucking profits; to combat the thousands of idiots just repeating ""hold""?"
2021-05-05 16:16:15,wallstreetbets,Why are you geys
2021-05-05 16:32:57,wallstreetbets,Sure am getting a lot of crypto scam spam from this wsb discord action lately

Would you rather fight one horse sized duck or 100 duck sized horses?"
2021-05-05 16:15:47,wallstreetbets,"Lot of trust issues, given a certain contest people will think this is a trap imo. You’ve also banned for less at times."

2021-05-05 16:11:51,wallstreetbets,What will SPY close on next Friday? Asking for a friend.
2021-05-05 16:07:42,wallstreetbets,"This is our forum, keep the discussions here. What's will the 35 new mods? Many with new accounts?"

2021-05-05 17:30:59,wallstreetbets,How are mods selected to be mods in WSB?
2021-05-05 16:50:20,wallstreetbets,"I have seen comments in the daily thread multiple times about ""I posted a DD on \*insert company here\* and it was removed, that company has since gone up X% and people are missing out"".

&#x200B;

I saw replies to that suggesting that there was some sort of conspiracy where the mods keep all the good DD for themselves by deleting it before the rest of us can see it.

&#x200B;

What do you have to say in response to that?

Is there anyone checking what the moderators remove and if the mod was right to remove it?"
2021-05-05 16:04:25,wallstreetbets,"Why are the moderators on this sub, being denounced as paid shills on other subs?"
2021-05-05 16:35:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I have a question, first off how dare you? Secondly, who do you think you are?"
2021-05-05 15:59:28,wallstreetbets,"Will the GME thread return, and if so, by when?"
2021-05-05 16:27:11,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, what are the grounds for removing posts on certain tickers while keeping others up?"
2021-05-05 15:48:06,wallstreetbets,can i get a refund?
2021-05-05 15:59:39,wallstreetbets,How compromised is this sub? Asking for a friend?
2021-05-05 17:38:33,wallstreetbets,looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
2021-05-05 17:55:40,wallstreetbets,This is getting so embarrassing at this point I think the HF are running the other subs instead of WSB just to destroy the idea of retail investors working together.
2021-05-05 18:00:56,wallstreetbets,Sounds gay
2021-05-05 18:21:02,wallstreetbets,Why are mods gey? And why am I gey?

2021-05-05 16:17:31,wallstreetbets,This sub has gone to hell and a hand basket.
2021-05-05 16:49:46,wallstreetbets,"Mods are not paid shills. Take off your tinfoil hats. The amount of work that u/opinion_is_unpopular and u/zjz and all of the other mods have to do to keep 10 million retards in line must be unimaginable. 

Without them, this sub would be a P&D. The current mods are the only people stopping that.

Quit with the conspiracy mindset."
2021-05-05 15:48:08,wallstreetbets,Boxers or briefs?

2021-05-05 16:41:57,wallstreetbets,"Why would reddit mods think that redditors would want to go on discord to have a discussion?

Why are GME threads getting removed?

Why was a post by Dennis Kelleher removed?

Do you not understand how bullshit “oh they are alts” sounds in response to the flood of new low-karma mods? Why do you need alt accounts to be mods?"
2021-05-05 15:54:30,wallstreetbets,"""we want you guys to understand how things are changing"" ftfy"
2021-05-05 16:06:03,wallstreetbets,Ew I remember WSB on discord is like that meth addicted basement dwelling  Mickey Mouse meme. Way to incelly figured that’s why it was banned couple months back.
2021-05-05 18:08:33,wallstreetbets,Bunch of citadel cucks.
2021-05-05 16:15:32,wallstreetbets,Whats with all the new mods? This sub has been compromised.
2021-05-05 16:23:58,wallstreetbets,"1-So who is part of the ""directors"" on the mod team and who are minimods? Can we get a list of rankings?

2-Can you explain this post you made? Can you also explain why you say that the sub was never compromised while you seem very concerned about that in this post? https://i.imgur.com/KPGUMBA.jpg

3-How much are they paying you for this?

4-Do you seriously expect people to believe that the past few months haven't been coordinated pump and dumps through manipulated sentiment? Can you answer this question in a way that doesn't involve the words ""new subscribers""?

5-Which one of your fuckboys didn't know what the word meant?

6-Do you think the current state of the sub is anything like how it used to be? And do you ever feel sad about the death of old wsb?"
2021-05-05 16:00:54,wallstreetbets,Oh shit. Here we go again...
2021-05-05 16:07:08,wallstreetbets,"Whats up with those ""Powerups"" and the ""Merch-Store""?"

2021-05-05 16:16:46,wallstreetbets,"When someone is caught fucking up for an honest mistake, they are transparent in their guilt. When someone is caught fucking up due to compromised integrity, they obscure things out of self preservation.

2021-05-05 16:08:44,wallstreetbets,"Most of them aren't new, though some are alt accounts. You have to remove everyone above me if you want to slide me up the list, for example.

So, we have to remove a bunch of mods and re-add them in a specific order if we want to make sure the top of the list is trusted and the seniority is represented by ""who can remove who"" instead of ""who randomly hit accept when we were re-making the list three months ago"".

For those that don't know, the mod list is kind of a ranking system. You can remove everyone below you and change their perms. The top of the list is important."
2021-05-05 16:39:38,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it's our place to tell people how to trade. We set up a loose scope with the market cap rules and whatnot and say ""go for it"".

I think we actually deviated away from that unintentionally by giving GME its own thread for months, though removing that is seen as a sign of being *purchased by Melvin*, etc."

Real answer: it varies, but some basic criteria are you have to have been in the sub for over a year, been a good member, and know the rules.  Obviously many people fit that description and aren’t mods, but like I said, there isn’t a uniform selection process, it varies on a case by case basis."
2021-05-05 17:37:17,wallstreetbets,"My approach there is to generally ask ""what post"". It's easy to swap stories of magic posts that we're hoarding.

Most of the time the guy replies with a genuinely awful post that was like one sentence or obviously shilled NFTs and the bot said ""no NFTs"" in a comment reply which he ignored.

We all keep an eye on the removed submissions feed."

Now it seems like there are other subs making up nefarious interpretations of things faster than you can address them.

Y'know, back in the day, everyone blows up on SUNE, everyone goes ""haha we eat paint chips, bad trade"". Now if everyone blows up on MVIS there are three subs voting things to the top saying ""wow it's an obvious pump, damn hedgies"".

What do you even do about that?"

Or news post about regulation (801 I'm looking at you) that are market news which at the very least are of interest to a fair amount of the people following this subreddit.

I don't believe the ""mods are sellouts"" conspiracy theories, but at this point all I can think is that you're simply morons. You keep working against yourselves with your very actions, and then complain at how people react and interpret them.

You mods catered to the part of the sub that hates on GME-ers, probably also because (a fair amount of) you mods are annoyed by it and/or the extra workload it brings, and took a more strict, borderline censoring at times, attitude. This further fomented the divisiveness and the conspiracy theorists. You aren't acting in the best interest of the community here.

A for the conspiracy theories on ""pump and dumps""...

We've seen obvious distraction pumps by malicious actors (SLV), we've seen proof of bots pumping whatever non-GME was trending (calls on SSR anyone?), and we've seen proof of certain entities trying to recruit ""influential""/known users to ~~post about~~ pump unspecified stocks. While I concur that most of the conspiracy theories are just that, it's not even like people are completely pulling them out of their asses. They are the kind of things that happened. Awareness about Wall Street fuckery and media manipulation has also raised after the Jan events, reasonably and thankfully so, so people tend to be a little overly paranoic.

This place gained popularity due to the January events, popularity that isn't going away, and of course there are external profiteers trying to take advantage of that. Not everything is a ""GME distraction"", hardly anything probably, but you're naive if you think there aren't interested parties trying to capitalize on retail and WSB specifically. RKT at the end of Feb and MVIS a couple weeks ago definitely had interested parties behind them capitalizing on retail and probably pumping it a bit."

Furthermore a horse's most deadly attack is 200 mph at a force of 2000 lb with a kick requiring a pivoting space half the length of its body or more.   

Your average horse weighs 2,200 lb. Adjusting for the size ratio change down to 3.5 lb we get a final attack damage of

 .15% of 200mph = .3 mph

That doesn't seem very deadly.

2021-05-05 17:06:17,wallstreetbets,"I'm starting to think that Alex Jones resides in this subreddit and got mad that u/zjz banned him, so he started a conspiracy against him.

Just a theory, though."

You want the truth? Everyone sees that I worked really hard and still catch a ton of shit and doesn't want to be a known name anymore because it's not worth it. Nobody remembers your hard work or trusts you, they just use the username to know where to aim their anger."
2021-05-05 18:09:58,wallstreetbets,I don't think there's a battle at all since that would imply one side has any power over the other. zjz is in charge and doing a fair job as usual. All the people making things up to be upset about because they aren't fact checking are wrong and will be proven so in the course of time and also their whining has no power here.
2021-05-05 16:26:07,wallstreetbets,"What would be proof enough for you that I wasn't, besides <whatever you want me to do at this moment>?

Seems like a lot of people assume guilt here and can't be dissuaded."
2021-05-05 18:38:29,wallstreetbets,The media. International media corporations taking screenshots and doing research. If You think You're paranoid you should meet your average journalist.

2021-05-05 16:42:19,wallstreetbets,"I don't know what to do about anything anymore, it's frustrating. I liked enforcing a set of rules that people agreed on and keeping people happy.

There was always a bunch of crybabies, but now there are legions of conspiracy-bent weirdos mixed in with a bunch of assholes clearly pushing pds. Then the conspiracy weirdos buy into the pd, get burned, and boom - another conspiracy. 

I mean… honestly… who the fuck pays attention to the mod list order? 

Yeah, I know about the shit that happened earlier this year and the monetization thing a while back, but I thought *you* were supposed to be the one everyone trusted!

2021-05-05 17:27:08,wallstreetbets,The Hedge Funds are manipulating the price trying to get out...they are running out of time. They will be slaughtered on Earnings Release.

2021-05-05 17:56:51,wallstreetbets,I asked Matt Khors about this today. Picked it up at 71 thinking it would swing. The peloton news didn’t help. Earnings will hopefully bring us back to life.

Or he can write 3k off a year against his INCOME , not cap gains"
2021-05-05 15:55:30,wallstreetbets,Agreed. But they need to do something ASAP with that massive float.

NONETHELESS I AM ALL IN BABY. This stock is at a fantastic price, and institutions are slowly depleting away stocks (they must sell or borrow to sell stocks to pin it aka shorting) as we reach higher and higher resistances. Slowly and surely... there are many rolling their calls further and further out the pressure is on the hedges.

This price is favorable enough for me to go 80% of my portfolio. Buy pressure will soon be on AMD’s stellar ER has many looking at this stock again."

2021-05-05 16:28:59,wallstreetbets,"only tl;dr; because I can't do this in every AMD topic. 

Intels market losses aren't going to AMD, which is new, this used to be true always and also the other way around. ARM chips and people making new chips based on ARM (licensing income for ARM (like the new apple chips)) take market share away from Intel/AMD, which is bad for both even if it only affects intel right now. Funny you mention Nvidia, which is waiting for approval to take over ARM.

2021-05-05 16:09:40,wallstreetbets,Look at the technicals. Most are on here making purely speculative plays with more money than they are comfortable losing... this specific post is seeking a 23.98 price target based on a Hail Mary that this company has a MASSIVE surprise on earnings... this is a mistake...
2021-05-05 18:07:43,wallstreetbets,Can't fucking wait to see them print tomorrow lets gooooo. As soon as I saw the hype it was getting here I knew it was time for puts

2021-05-05 16:31:18,wallstreetbets,"If the play you are making on here isn't speculative, you are insider trading...  


A stock moving up \~$1.00 (<5%) isn't a hail mary either. He may lose some money and learn something, or he may make a little bit of money, if you have a crystal ball you shouldn't be here tbh"
2021-05-05 16:40:41,wallstreetbets,"All plays are speculative. OP was PURELY speculative. A stock moving up or down$1 isn’t uncommon. BUT, it isn’t common for this specific stock. I would encourage you to look back on the charts as well as take a look at the filings. The technicals do not warrant that price movement."
2021-05-05 15:48:35,wallstreetbets,"Yep, getting rid of confetti, sounds like a legit hearing. Being told we don't know how to manage our money..damn I see so much promise from the SEC. Pay for order flow you say, well how about this, we will charge you per trade and its still going to get routed through whoever the fuck pays us the most. 

How about hedge cucks pay .001 per transaction, how about any crime resulting in a conviction is now double what estimated profit was and seek jail terms when applicable. Allow no more self regulation and last but not least enforce the  laws that are already written.

I'm not holding out much hope, but we shall see. Gotta give Dub G. a chance.

With Citadel processing 47 fucking percent of all retail orders because of their PFOF contracts, their dark pool and FTD fuckery and them owning big media outlets (sprinkle in some social media pump n dumps) and they can position the market exactly there where they can profit the most off retail.

The whole thing is rigged. Fuck Citadel and fuck RH.

Seriously, I'll GLADLY pay commission if they fix this shit"
2021-05-05 19:48:37,wallstreetbets,The way it should be done
2021-05-05 17:52:22,wallstreetbets,Here's a question. Do our old politicians even know or understand what order flow is?
2021-05-05 19:46:20,wallstreetbets,"I don't think the number of D's or R's matter. There are too many politicians that use their positions to make highly profitable stock trades, and raising a stink in the market would be a little too close to home for them."
2021-05-05 17:53:07,wallstreetbets,but but muh both sides!

2021-05-05 16:30:11,wallstreetbets,i literally pay .5 eur+0.004usd/share. I'd say paying.... what 4.5 usd for \~ 1k share trade is not even a drop in the bucket. (Degiro)

2021-05-05 16:18:31,wallstreetbets,I'm paying minimum 14 euros per order. Eu. So why you whine?
2021-05-05 17:52:06,wallstreetbets,Why the fk would you care about lying 3-6 dollars you tight ass. I’d rather that than be absolutely raped by these criminals that buy your order flow.
2021-05-05 16:26:12,wallstreetbets,Yeah lol people out here really retarded if they think that somehow narrowing your profit margin is not a good thing for institutions and hedge funds lmfao.
2021-05-05 17:48:43,wallstreetbets,"Why should I have to pay commission to trade on the “free market”?

Edit: getting voted into oblivion because I don’t like PFOF or the idea of price gouging on commission? LOL"

2021-05-05 17:22:16,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry but how exactly does selling my data effect me worse than 5-10$ commission per trade?

Selling my data=more targeted ads. That's really it. It's not like I was going to be able to reap big rewards on my own data on my own anyways if it was protected and able to sell it and at least for me personally advertising doesn't have a profound effect on me opening my checkbook. I've been saving 60-80% of take home pay for the last 2 years targeted ads or not. All targeted ads means is I get to see more products that are relevant to me when I do decide to make a purchase which is great, more product knowledge=more stuff to research when I make a purchase.

If there's something I'm missing here I'd gladly like to know but I've always felt that personal data being sold is one of the most overblown fears of the 21st century. You were likely not going to reap big rewards selling it and you're not directly harmed by it being sold. If selling my data means I don't need to pay hundreds-thousands of dollars over my lifetime in trade commissions then by all means sell my data."
2021-05-05 18:11:53,wallstreetbets,It really is though. Those two events have 0 relation but that’s why people are pissed at PFOF
2021-05-05 19:41:25,wallstreetbets,They think pfof is bad because they bought 1 share of gme at 350 and feel screwed
2021-05-05 18:33:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I don't have the energy to point out to these morons that almost every US broker uses payment for orderflow. Retail gets lower commissions, brokers get an alternate revenue source and market makers make up for the money lost on tighter spreads with increased trading volume. Literally everyone in the fucking equation benefits from it."
2021-05-05 19:44:03,wallstreetbets,Ok Gordon Gecko. Tell mom to get dinner ready.

2021-05-05 18:05:42,wallstreetbets,Same. Its just weird to me how people don't like something so much that they don't want other people to be able to choose to participate in it.
2021-05-05 18:36:41,wallstreetbets,"Clearly, you've never had to deal with them moving the market against you on every single trade."
2021-05-05 17:27:04,wallstreetbets,This is true and why people dealing with large orders don’t use commission free brokerages. Robinhood was not created for people dealing in thousands of shares per order
2021-05-05 17:25:40,wallstreetbets,This costs you thousandth of a cent per share. Nothing close to 3-6$ per trade
2021-05-05 16:19:52,wallstreetbets,It would also encourage better investing decisions from retail if you’re burning 3-6 dollars per trade.
2021-05-05 18:49:00,wallstreetbets,"You literally don’t but feel free to continue not knowing anything about a subject and then spew nonsense about it like you do. This whole sub has no idea that they’re massive net beneficiaries from payment for order flow on a trading cost basis and that the the difference between good and bad execution is fractions of cents. Just because a position moves against you doesn’t mean it’s manipulated, maybe you just made a stupid trade"
2021-05-05 18:12:24,wallstreetbets,Because we don’t want to be like you europoors

2021-05-05 18:09:08,wallstreetbets,Because someone has to fill the order and they have to get paid.
2021-05-05 18:36:32,wallstreetbets,Hedge funds using order flow to analyze retail traders and manipulate the market costs us more than $5-$10... I’ll take the no free trades easily
2021-05-05 18:41:23,wallstreetbets,A fraction of a penny AND being moved against on single one of your trades will cost you a LOT more than $5-10.
2021-05-05 16:58:32,wallstreetbets,"If you're under PFOF, you're losing profit already since the MM is scalping you for pennies on the dollar. That's coming AND going, so they double dip.

Either get to a legit brokerage if you're going to scalp so these pfof assholes aren't stealing your tendies before you even hit the ""sell"" button or realize you're already losing that percent on your trades."
2021-05-05 16:10:51,wallstreetbets,Not saying it doesn't have its pros... but collectively it hurts more than it does good.
2021-05-05 18:14:51,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Commissions will kill the algo i’m working on

2021-05-05 18:17:16,wallstreetbets,"Selling order flow allows hedge funds to front run your trades, and scrape nickels out of everyone's pockets.

Billions of dollars a year, because they can see your trade, buy the stock that you were going to buy, and then sell it to you at a slightly higher price.  Or vice versa.  This happens on a millisecond / nanosecond timescale.

Read Flash Boys.  Tell your broker to use IEX.  Try not to go full rage mode when you realize just how much money is being stolen by the hedgies and big banks on this."
2021-05-05 17:46:20,wallstreetbets,When they say selling your data they aren’t talking about selling data that you like beer so you get Budweiser ads. PFOF data isn’t for targeted ads. They sell your order info.

2021-05-05 17:28:00,wallstreetbets,I use TDAmeritrade. No PFOF. I was simply stating that $5 per trade would be worse for me.
2021-05-05 16:34:45,wallstreetbets,"no he isn't, lol."
2021-05-05 16:51:29,wallstreetbets,I'm interested to hear why you think so.
2021-05-05 18:43:09,wallstreetbets,"If by ""harming"", you mean ""not being ready to hold your bags like you want him to"", then good, you deserve it for not being able to trade for shit."

2021-05-05 17:53:10,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't that still arguably not be worse than 5-10 dollars a trade to most people here who trade more often than most?

Like I find it hard to believe your profits are being that impacted unless you're talking about a sizable, sudden swing in price which isn't common. It's possibly worse for the index investor maybe? Even then I'd like to see the numbers behind that."
2021-05-05 18:07:31,wallstreetbets,And clearly you’re the dupee if you think this would be good or that the Robinhood issue was anything other than relating to liquidity
2021-05-05 18:08:00,wallstreetbets,That had nothing to do with PFOF dumbass
2021-05-05 18:24:42,wallstreetbets,rh been around longer than that
2021-05-05 19:14:02,wallstreetbets,I too plug my ears and scream when I hear things I don’t like
2021-05-05 19:04:42,wallstreetbets,"You might be right on an individual level. If you're doing a lot of small trades where $5-$10 is a serious concern, it could be that this is worse for you. However, the group you are a part of (retail traders in general) is significantly hurt by this.

The larger the trades you are making (i.e. thousands of shares vs. hundreds or dozens of shares) the more PFOF is hurting you. And they are hurting you both ways on every deal.

We are basically talking about the scam from Superman 3 or Office Space. They're screwing you out of pennies -> dollars (depending on size of order) per share per order. Which means, collectively, they're taking billions of dollars from retail investors. From you personally odds are it is not that much. But across the market, well...there's a reason companies like Citadel are so willing to cover that $5-$10/order cost for Robin Hood and other brokerages. And that's because they make money on the transaction. In specific, they make money *at your expense*."
2021-05-05 18:44:50,wallstreetbets,"Clearly, you've never been moved against on every single one of your trades."
2021-05-05 19:57:53,wallstreetbets,"How about proving your claim that order flow is unfukkable?

I’m sure Hedgies would never do any shady that gives them an edge."

2021-05-05 19:39:13,wallstreetbets,"1. You open any trade, even with a hedge.

2. Then your data gets sold to the institutions to determine exactly where to move the market to maximize your risk and loss.

3. And that's exactly where they'll move the market and keep it there for as long as they feel like it."
2021-05-05 15:46:24,wallstreetbets,"Lmao want to know something funny. I bought this stock in april at an average price of 31$ I had 258 shares & when I read the news about the shares being sold off, I thought a dip was coming.

At a SP of $100/share, you're looking at a 121 billion dollar valuation. That's ludicrous."

Must be a lot of donkeys over there. Moore's law is dead. We're pretty close to peak processor die composition across the board. GPUs are not a large enough market to drive the 30x P/E in AMD. When the inflationary cycle commits and the CPI goes up, AMD's performance will take a big hit, and their share price will tank. AMD has almost no market share in enterprise and they're failing to break in. Their commercial consumer base is low. Their end user base is higher but they've been unable to release enough product to move the needle due to COVID. Again, when inflation starts its corrective march, end user discretionary spending will vanish and AMD will finally have stock on shelf and no one buying. There's little to no innovation to make from their 7nm process since 5nm is under the physical limit for electron tunneling.

They are wildly overvalued by retail."

2021-05-05 18:42:56,wallstreetbets,"Due to my job as an auditor, I've read many shareholders' votes protocols and attended several shareholder meetings as well.

The voting items are **absolutely standard** and legally required (ie. appointment of auditor), there's nothing even remotely interesting there.

Some people argued they might bring up something interesting during the last item (""miscellaneous"" or whatever they called it). Trust me, they won't. Nobody ever really does, it's just customary. A respectable company would never bring up a highly complicated/controversial issue (like a reverse stock split or whatever) and immediately expect sharehodlers to make an informed decision without prior notice.

You never really know with GameStop, so take my statement with a grain of salt, but I highly doubt this will be any kind of catalyst."

2021-05-05 18:01:36,wallstreetbets,Gamestop released a statement mid-april about the upcoming proxy information and voting and in it they listed an up to date count of the shares held by the top ten institutional shareholders.  Those shares added up plus the known insider holdings left only about 26 million shares for retail to buy (this didn't even include institutional holding outside of the top ten so it's likely far less than 26 million available but it's a good conservative number to go with). It's extremely likely that retail owns much more than 26 million shares which is why people still believe GME is highly shorted.

If you don't count all votes, you would deprive (some) shareholders of their right to vote, which is one of the most fundamental rights of an actual owner of the entity.

I agree with your general point however. The entire theory relies on the fact that there is a higher SI than reported **and** that the supposed excess (""phantom"") shares are all held by retail **and** that enough of retailers vote. Seems unlikely to me."

A youtuber replied to my comment with his phone number and now he wants make business with me, better said I gave him 10k and he told me he can make me 3k weekly with 20% for his skills. Shall I go forward with this or you guys think he’s scamming me maybe?

Edit: I downvoted myself, I just wanted to ask quick cause it’s kinda heavy on me rn. Won’t happen again"
2021-05-05 16:11:12,wallstreetbets,Nah people on the internet don't scam.
2021-05-05 16:07:11,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a scam
2021-05-05 17:31:49,wallstreetbets,That’s for sure legit! Except I can make you $4k weekly with only 15% for my skills so you’re getting ripped off fasho
2021-05-05 17:44:02,wallstreetbets,Good advice

2021-05-05 17:14:23,wallstreetbets,"Condolences for AH. Hope it bounces back for you.

As someone who's been following for a while (and was on a similar path until you blew past me... with CRSR maybe?) I'm confused about your strategy, unless you have some solid info on RKT. I remember you'd be floating around to different stocks after a few weeks, crushing it each time. I don't remember you ever holding this long. 

Either way, hope to see you at 10 figures soon"

2021-05-05 14:54:30,wallstreetbets,"Originally started this position on March 1st 2021 with $1.7M. The app keeps the original cost basis of $24.12 but the dividend reduced it so the math is a bit wonky but I’m break even again after a trip from $1.7M to $3M down to $1.6M and back to $1.7M

2021-05-05 18:31:08,wallstreetbets,The picks keep going from bad to worse now. Still can’t believe you didn’t sell that day after you bought and doubled your money overnight. Big mistake. Didn’t want to look like a pump and dumper that you are and missed out
2021-05-05 16:13:49,wallstreetbets,I was thinking about u today
2021-05-05 16:42:47,wallstreetbets,I dont have any positions on this garbage but damn. This shit killed it on earnings and the stock just nosedived lol.
2021-05-05 15:25:22,wallstreetbets,"Whoever TF is dumping at the $23 price level can go to hell! It would appear that regardless of whether the volume of shares traded is 3Million or 13Million, the share price is still the same and still coudn't take off and get TF away from the $23 curse!!! Something's not adding up. Am I missing something???"

That recent spike was fun, but baseless near as I can figure."

2021-05-05 15:29:32,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty interested in the earnings report as a new home buyer (closed Apr. 27).  The market is batshit insane in Denver, CO - for the house we closed on, we were the first people to view it - everything is going over ask by 20-30k with major repairs waived.

I think we viewed right around 46 houses and put down 4 offers.

2021-05-05 16:45:49,wallstreetbets,"You can always come back to CRSR, where momentum is on your side. RKT could lose it's support and could be on a downward trend until it consolidates. Then there's always the risk of the fed raising rates, which you have zero control over. If that happens, could be 12 months before you break even with RKT."

2021-05-05 16:01:23,wallstreetbets,I invested in my first stock today because of your post 🙌🙌
2021-05-05 17:08:15,wallstreetbets,It’s by design.
2021-05-05 16:51:03,wallstreetbets,They missed earnings.
2021-05-05 16:23:53,wallstreetbets,You think these markets make sense?
2021-05-05 15:21:11,wallstreetbets,Yes I sold 88k shares at $15 in Dec
2021-05-05 17:27:23,wallstreetbets,Its his 401k account and we all bag holding.

2021-05-05 17:57:32,wallstreetbets,tomorrow.
2021-05-05 15:22:32,wallstreetbets,"this stock is at its floor. 

tech mega caps have been dropping on earnings because they're at their ceilings already and guidance doesn't account for insane growth needed to maintain highs.

RKT is not in that boat."
2021-05-05 16:07:23,wallstreetbets,For sure! And what the fuck was that halt today about?
2021-05-05 14:58:19,wallstreetbets,Correct. Only shares allowed in 401k
2021-05-05 16:09:34,wallstreetbets,Reminds me of the day RH and all the other brokerages started limiting trades on GME and the halt allowed the HF a break from the squeeze to get a grip on the price again. Some real bullshit going on that was swept under the rug on our dollar.
2021-05-05 17:32:21,wallstreetbets,Do you have any idea who tf youre talking to you supreme idiot? Shut your whore mouth.

2021-05-05 17:11:42,wallstreetbets,"Hype.  People buy it in the hype then when earnings are either slightly short or even hit their mark, the sell volume is insane, causing a drop in price.

Fundamentally RKT is fairly priced for a long term hold"

2021-05-05 17:51:35,wallstreetbets,Lol idk why this is funny

2021-05-05 17:42:35,wallstreetbets,I'm curious since you've held it for so long now. Holding for the bounce back or selling tomorrow at open?

2021-05-05 16:23:58,wallstreetbets,"Sorry homie, hopefully you find opportunities to make it back and then some."

2021-05-05 16:10:19,wallstreetbets,Yikes down 170k or something that sucks
2021-05-05 16:24:27,wallstreetbets,"Have you followed JACK at all? This dude doesn't sell until he finds the next big thing to dump his cash pile into. Balls of steel are what got him to where he is now. Not my style personally, but he seems to know how to pick 'em."
2021-05-05 18:34:42,wallstreetbets,He didn’t want to look like a pump and dumper by doing that. He pretended to play it cool like it would be back up there again in a week or two lol. Very poor decision IMO.
2021-05-05 18:38:22,wallstreetbets,First lesson of WSB. You always lose money
2021-05-05 16:06:13,wallstreetbets,You are so getting laid tonight! Welcome to the fuck the HF crew. Remember that we need to pick up our brothers at 40 so don't sell and leave them with monster blue balls.

2021-05-05 15:30:54,wallstreetbets,"RKT also has an extremely reasonable P/E. And in comparison to competitors' P/E's, RKT is undervalued."

2021-05-05 18:55:20,wallstreetbets,Just don't post afterwards no one owes anything to these tards. He's gonna bag hold for awhile now
2021-05-05 17:13:36,wallstreetbets,Looks like he's sleeping on the couch while his wife's boyfriend ducks tonight
2021-05-05 17:05:19,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at $20.24, kind of a no brainer. Missed earnings by .01, from someone’s estimate? Spring is their peak. No worries. Stock was already undervalued."
2021-05-05 18:55:12,wallstreetbets,its a great buying opportunity
2021-05-05 18:50:44,wallstreetbets,"You’re probably somewhat new to investing.  It’s not down due to a .01 miss, what happened last qtr is done, it’s down due to their forecast for “next” qtr which we’re probably 1/2 way thru already.  When you see a stock move up or down for “no reason” then they report earnings and they’re lower and the shares hardly move, it’s because they already did, remember “for no reason”  so watch during the qtr not once they’re released.  Then do what I did and buy 100 $21 puts that expire on the 7th for .30"
2021-05-05 15:36:36,wallstreetbets,Not worth dwelling
2021-05-05 18:22:04,wallstreetbets,"I bought at $21 and sold at $57 because I couldn't cancel the sell limit by 5 seconds because of a fucking customer at work. 

I bought back in at $88 with 100 shares and rode it all the way to $480 and had my fingers ready to cash out at $400 but I got greedy and didn't sell. TWO TIMES!! With AMC I had my fingers at the sell button when I bought it the night before at $4.xx and it rocketed to $25 when I woke up at 9AM. I didn't sell because I thought it would go higher and yes, I got greedy.

That's almost $60,000 in gains not including my BB and NOK plays that I also fucked up on the way down.

If only that fucking Friday I didn't have to go to work...if there wasn't a customer that took my time....if I held those 215 shares of GME, I would have had 6 digits gains and sold at $400....If...if...

And if I had cashed out $100,000 in gains I would have just threw $10,000 at GME when it was $40 for fun play....now imagine that. I would have 250 shares and times that by today's value it would have been $42,500....

I might have even sold it at $300 during that spike on March 10th."

2021-05-05 18:57:10,wallstreetbets,I agree! I think got more wrapped up in wanted to be accepted and loved by people on WSB rather than focusing on actually securing the bag
2021-05-05 15:38:17,wallstreetbets,You’re the man
2021-05-05 16:26:30,wallstreetbets,I'm in the same boat as you in RKT. Do you think it's worth holding onto and how long it would be for it to payoff? (I'm new-I know you're not responsible for anything)

2021-05-05 15:24:42,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, I think the ceiling could be higher"
2021-05-05 14:35:22,wallstreetbets,"Ive been holding BB for a few months and been in since it was around 20$. I will keep holding until it goes back up, so I still believe it will."
2021-05-05 14:40:35,wallstreetbets,"They changed up their leadership team, so now it's a wait and see if this team knows how to make income off of their tech.

Previous team was giving away the tech and the data."
2021-05-05 14:38:08,wallstreetbets,"They have a patent “mega sale” on the horizon with a 7 year tail, partnerships with many automotive manufacturers, governments, and positioned for the expansion of IoT and vehicular connectivity. I believe they’re positioned well for the coming years where the revenue will really come in. I like this stock."
2021-05-05 14:38:10,wallstreetbets,Holding BB
2021-05-05 14:53:17,wallstreetbets,Def don't think it's a short term play at all. Probably steady rise in the next few years but who really knows. Do feel like anything below 10 is a steal though.
2021-05-05 14:56:39,wallstreetbets,I don’t expect any movement until 2022-2023 Hodl...
2021-05-05 18:24:26,wallstreetbets,I buy 100 every month. 2300 and counting. This bitch will fly once EV take off as they control all the cyber.
2021-05-05 14:34:55,wallstreetbets,i love wheeling this shit. but this sentiment may be the wrong subreddit.
2021-05-05 14:45:38,wallstreetbets,"Not for a long time, in at 21.50 my sons will likely bag hold when I’m dead too."
2021-05-05 17:55:56,wallstreetbets,I bought 12 more shares today @8.22. I think its going to be a sleeping giant.
2021-05-05 16:24:07,wallstreetbets,"BB is a very long play, they have an impressive lineup of products & partnerships, but translating those to profits (which I’m confident they eventually will) is going to take a long time. I’m holding."
2021-05-05 14:37:11,wallstreetbets,Hodl
2021-05-05 14:45:03,wallstreetbets,They're likely to make a comeback is the same chance as windows 3.11 is coming back. They are essentially just a patent holder and security. They are worth 4b and I don't trust they will ever be able to grow larger than many of the other sea of public companies out there.  It's amazing to me how bullish everyone is on memes like Nokia and blackberry.  You can buy a cheaper company on the market and make slow and steady growth or dividends instead of trading sideways on these forever and getting excited when they pop 30% in one day.
2021-05-05 14:37:35,wallstreetbets,Dog with fleas Buddy
2021-05-05 14:50:21,wallstreetbets,apple happened to blackberry

2021-05-05 16:35:13,wallstreetbets,"Glad to see there are HODLers here for BB, gives me hope we will go to the moon and beyond!"
2021-05-05 14:37:33,wallstreetbets,"Me too, moon or sleeping on the street"
2021-05-05 15:02:42,wallstreetbets,Agreed. BB isn’t the only stock dropping the last few days. Been buying the dips and have my costs down to $8.70.  I think I’m in a great position for the future
2021-05-05 14:52:19,wallstreetbets,I pray everyday <3
2021-05-05 15:17:54,wallstreetbets,"The patents are worth millions, not billions. They are also already valued in their books. I don't think their sale will increase significantly the stock price. It's still a valuable company, but it needs a catalyst to go further."
2021-05-05 16:57:36,wallstreetbets,"Why is patent selling seen as a good thing? It's basically asset selling: bread for today, hunger for tomorrow."
2021-05-05 14:55:38,wallstreetbets,For sure.
2021-05-05 15:01:42,wallstreetbets,Moon 2022
2021-05-05 14:35:46,wallstreetbets,Same.
2021-05-05 14:54:00,wallstreetbets,Moon?
2021-05-05 16:29:27,wallstreetbets,"Except blackberry actually has something going for it. Now they’re primarily a cyber security company and a criminally undervalued one at that compared to the other big names in the cyber security world. Their phones were known for being extremely secure, there’s a reason why so many government leaders all over the world used them, that combined with the announcement of a new 5G phone releasing this year is definitely gonna cause some movement. Blackberry isn’t a short term deal like GME or AMC."
2021-05-05 14:49:36,wallstreetbets,"BB has the same revenue as PLTR, yet, PLTR is 10x the market cap. Imagine that."
2021-05-05 14:53:28,wallstreetbets,"we know that, but now BB is into car and drone security and looks like it has potential to go up on paper, but for now nothing is happening"
2021-05-05 14:41:13,wallstreetbets,Ahahahhaha
2021-05-05 15:10:09,wallstreetbets,"On past performance, I wouldn't pay more than $7 and that was a stretch, which is why I don't have a position in it.

Will probably take new team 6 months to have an impact, so will keep an eye on it till then."
2021-05-05 17:36:37,wallstreetbets,Where on the books would that be? Things can be revalued... settling with FB on patent breaches can inflate patent sales values as a way to “settle” financially too.
2021-05-05 17:35:41,wallstreetbets,"Not if it’s to sell patents for an industry you no longer serve. As a former telephone company, they’ll have thousands of mobile telephone patents and comms patents to serve somebody else better. There’s no use them sitting on a file generating very little for the company."
2021-05-05 15:47:11,wallstreetbets,Wen?
2021-05-05 14:54:37,wallstreetbets,I'm imagining diff things cause of your flair 👀
2021-05-05 18:44:18,wallstreetbets,"They are shown as intangible assets in the balance sheet. Last time I checked BBs patents were worth ~$500m. Licensing and settlements could inflate those numbers, but this is not going to make the stock price explode."
2021-05-05 19:19:53,wallstreetbets,"But under GAAP, unless amortisable or purchased, a patent wouldn’t appear on a balance sheet. BB wouldn’t have slapped a sticker price on every patent upon getting them, unless they purchased them. The research to produce patented works can be written off, but it doesn’t mean the patent in of itself would go onto the balance sheet. I hope that clarifies the point."
2021-05-05 19:40:21,wallstreetbets,"That's correct, they do have IP from acquisitions and not all of the resellable value of their patents is in their balance sheet, that's available knowledge. Still, that doesn't make the stock more valuable than what it is."
2021-05-05 15:40:43,wallstreetbets,Good thing it’s my second largest position;)
2021-05-05 14:33:59,wallstreetbets,So should I buy a call? Or a put? Someone help me🙏🙏🙏

2021-05-05 18:35:19,wallstreetbets,"Hey guys heres a gay bear thesis. \[copy pasted from another thread enjoy\]

Everybody bought the products they need and it will take 3-4 years to get profits like this again? \[cyclical product/overhyped buy/\] negative earnings past few years \[maybe due to acquisitions but still...\] 30% of stockholders equity\[370m of the 500m is in goodwill\] Increasing inventories when demand is going to drop off when covid ends. 4 of my friends bought webcams for our desktop we probably would've never bought webcams if not for covid.In 2020, 2019 and 2018, Amazon accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue, at 24.6%, 25.1% and 22.4%, respectively.reliance on amazon for profit margins.... Gamestop entering space... Amazon entering space... competitors are growing and taking small margins.

**There P/E is 30 during the greatest economic event ever for gaming \[covid\]. Seriously your overpaying.**

Short 10-20%... If a company is short more then 5% you should ask yourself the bear thesis.

Final comment: 40% of revenues come from drams... I don't see ram being a mega purchase in 2022. Time will tell.

2021-05-05 14:35:54,wallstreetbets,Wait for the dip tomorrow and buy back in. Your motivation for selling isnt a great one. If you don't like when stocks go up and down go dollar cost average your way into VTSAX and never come back to WSB again.
2021-05-05 16:18:55,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I get way more excited for Corsair products than I do for Logitech, but they are certainly the entrenched brand for many products. But it isn't a direct comparison either because Corsair does Power Supplies and RAM, etc, and LOGI does not."
2021-05-05 17:58:52,wallstreetbets,They are diversifying away from logitech. They are doubling down on the gaming/streaming and building an esports coaching platform and engage in other esports-related stuff.
2021-05-05 14:17:24,wallstreetbets,Let's assume you're right. Even if this is done running for the moment it really has nowhere to go but up in the medium and long term. There are very few things I feel as confident about in the market as I do with CRSR and that's saying a lot given the shit show that has been price to earnings action this quarter.

2021-05-05 18:28:08,wallstreetbets,Why would you try to squeeze CRSR at 20% when CLOV is at 40%?
2021-05-05 14:15:31,wallstreetbets,"I've been building PC's since I was 12 and that was some time in the 90's, so when I found out CRSR had gone public I was ecstatic. They always have the absolute best products for whatever category they're currently competing in."

The initial idea was buy back my shares at a dip and get one or two more, since I initially bought CRSR at one of its highs. Wasn't quite worth it to stay in with what I had since I couldn't drop my IV down. Then I come here and see I picked the wrong fucking time to sell lmao.

2021-05-05 18:39:41,wallstreetbets,">by the meme's of eccentric billionaires right now I guess. This is especially moronic because the fundamentals are so incredibly good for this company. As it currently stands market cap is roughly $3 billion, with expected revenue of $2 billion for the year and EBITDA earnings estimated for 2021 at around $250 million. In other words, CRSR has a forward P/E of about 12 right now and Price to Sales of 1.5x, low enough to make a value company blush, and yet this is a rocket fueled growth company in a rapidly expanding growth sector with 20% short interest.  
>  
>Digging a little deeper:

It doesn't make sense because there is no squeze with 6% short interest. The stock has also been under pressure since the lock-up period expired. I am a bag holder myself. Looking to sell with an acceptable loss in the next couple of days."
2021-05-05 18:58:22,wallstreetbets,"CLOV has a VERY STRONG BEAR THESIS. Their revenue is almost non-existent and it doesn't justify their current market cap at all. Will they have a good quarter? Who knows (I don't think so). Will their partnership with Walmart help? Maybe, but you're not likely to see it anywhere in the numbers until next year considering medicare advantage sign ups don't start until October this year. CLOV is shorted by 40% for very good reasons. I can't find any good reasons for CRSR being shorted 20%."

If the price goes up to $30, which it will eventually, (gamma squeeze or not), then you'll be sitting on a nice profit with your $17.5 average (slightly higher average if you calculate in the $500 something in premium you paid)."

2021-05-05 14:35:23,wallstreetbets,I think this is an OK play. Worst case you exercise the options and hold 200 shares at a cost basis of 22.85. Which is a great discount

Is this saying op paid ~5.50 or what ever the image said  per share in premium for each 100 share contracts. 
Exercising his option would gain those shares at 17.50 + 5.50ish per share meaning to be ITM he has to be over 22.85 to break even? And anything before expiration, assuming the contract is exercised if it's ITM, he would profit anything over Break even?

I'm not sure why people are saying this is dumb, could someone explain to me so I can understand what I'm missing here?

Also... how is the premium per share on the contract determined? +5.00 pershare at 17.50 seems pricey"

2021-05-05 13:30:02,wallstreetbets,Relatively deep ITM. Not likely to expire worthless. The delta is nearly 1. They basically took a leveraged long position.
2021-05-05 14:47:04,wallstreetbets,Or maybe not $10 itm 2 day out with $500 premium.
2021-05-05 15:55:25,wallstreetbets,"Most people who trade contracts never exercise them. The capital needed is quite a lot depending on how many contract is in the money. They just like to trade calls/puts for the premiums.

What OP bought is just in the money contracts, which is less risky but the premium is high. So if RKT launches, he'll sell those 2 contracts for a higher premium than what he originally paid for them.

The prices of an option contract (calls/puts) is determine by their Greeks values. You can find many videos on youtube about this which will explain and go into details. Options is basically a giant math equation with multiple changing variables, one variable changes another and so the price fluctuate and all of the variables react different based on the option expiration date.

I trade options  for the premium. I like the high risk high reward. Buying $RKT $30 weekly call for dirt cheap and hoping $RKT launches then sell for the premium."
2021-05-05 14:33:17,wallstreetbets,Why would you ever exercise on a call with extrinsic value exceeding anything you could get from dividends?
2021-05-05 14:39:07,wallstreetbets,Because anything itm prices in the difference between current price and strike price.
2021-05-05 16:06:06,wallstreetbets,Valid point 🤔
2021-05-05 13:40:35,wallstreetbets,since this is his first time buying calls i doubt he’s leveraging anything
2021-05-05 15:59:32,wallstreetbets,"Awesome
 Thanks for the explanation!"
2021-05-05 14:46:46,wallstreetbets,"Would you mind expanding this? Are you saying don't excessive the call prior to expiration since it will keep going up, as to maximize the sell price? Or are you saying just to purchase the 100 and let it continue, if you have the cash on hand?"
2021-05-05 14:01:25,wallstreetbets,Leverage doesn't have to be on margin. This person could have bought about 40 shares. Instead they bought 2 calls with a delta of about 1. They essentially are playing 5x the shares. They will basically move up or down with the change in price.
2021-05-05 14:55:08,wallstreetbets,"So, there's almost never a good reason to exercise unless you're covering for a short leg on a position. You are throwing extrinsic value away when you can simply sell the call to a big bank with the capital to buy 100 shares.

Besides, for people with the sort of cash to exercise on exspensive contracts can simply sell covered calls or trade the wheel for a reliable income stream anyway."
2021-05-05 18:28:37,wallstreetbets,"you almost never exercise because you end up giving up time value, but ops calls are deep itm and only have 2 dte that it's essentially all intrinsic value  

so exercising is fine if he has the capital and wants to hold his position beyond 5/7"

the amount of effort to make these manually is too damn high.

there needs to be a meme maker sight where you feed it a bunch of long form video feeds, and it face-recognitions the people in them, and builds a transcript+dictionary for each one. Then as you type, it gives autocomplete for words/phrases it found, and when you've finished typing and submit it creates a super cut of the person(s) saying the words you've indicated. bonus points for finding clips where the mouth is obscured and using those along with voice synthesized from their voiceprint to have them say words they didn't even say."

2021-05-05 14:24:32,wallstreetbets,"*FACTS*  Repost this and make it go viral to educate and remind all Shibes.  2 resources
==================

 Easily $10

Imagine going back in time and buying Bitcoin for under a dollar.   

1.  Read this to the bottom:
   [https://provscons.com/is-dogecoin-capped/](https://provscons.com/is-dogecoin-capped/)

2.  If price movement scares you.  Change view settings to week or month.

3.  www.dogemyths.com 

*the goal/purpose was/is being able to use DOGE as currency in exchange for goods and services as a replacement to government backed fiat/paper currency which controls people.  If you own businesses, accept DOGE.  Look to purchase things from places that only take DOGE.  Then the movement REALLY snowballs.  Won't happen overnight, but it's happening.  God bless you all. ✌.  Peace #dogecoin #thepeoplescurrency #DoOnlyGoodEveryday #DOGEHISTORY

PS.  DOGE started as a joke... And for smiles and laughs and levity.  That's why the memes are so clever and hilarious.  Don't lose that when you are blessed with money.  Don't take yourself too seriously, be humble, gracious, and generous with others.  Like in the movie Captain America, DOGE amplifies who you are... Good or bad.  * remember, we won't be around forever, love one another."

2021-05-05 17:33:24,wallstreetbets,"Clarification:

There is no ""Rule 801"". The appendage ""801"" is used to indicate advance notice is being given for a proposal.

What we have referred to as ""Rule 801"" (actually SR-NSCC-2021-801) is merely the Advance Notice for SR-NSCC-2021-002. It is not a proposed rule change itself. Same for SR-OCC-2021-801. See the titles for each:

Again, since they are appended with ""801"", they are merely advance notices of proposed rule changes, not the actual proposals themselves."

2021-05-05 14:06:27,wallstreetbets,"Yes and Rees-Mogg's (dude in the video and major Brexit proponent) father basically wrote the book on disaster capitalism: [Blood in the Streets: Investment Profits in a World Gone Mad by William Rees-Mogg](https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Streets-Investment-Profits-World/dp/067162735X)

The whole Brexit thing was basically a major cash and power grab by the upper class sprinkled with some foreign profiteering."
2021-05-05 16:56:16,wallstreetbets,This is the crash the tune refers to - Brexit
2021-05-05 14:14:00,wallstreetbets," Very few people in the political class wanted brexit but the populace did. It's actually a very interesting phenomenon because the centre right absolutely did not want brexit but the centre left did. So you had the ruling party pretending they wanted to leave and the opposition pretending they wanted to stay. Which resulted in pretty tepid attitudes on both sides, rather than the blood and thunder you might expect. 

The UK has not crashed (had triple recession but so did...everywhere) but will almost certainly be weakened, long term, unless they get into a firm economic and/or political alliance via CANZUK. Right now the UK is not significantly different to any other wealthy nation in that covid has loaded on colossal debt (look at the debt:GDP ratios) but inflation is crazy low so it's...ok? It's almost as if covid has ameliorated a lot of the issues brexit caused because everyone's getting whacked by increased commodity prices, luxury goods inflations/supply problems, heavy debt, massive welfare expenses and whole sale changes to society. I personally think the FTSE100 is a good investment (not that I am invested) at the moment."
2021-05-05 14:06:30,wallstreetbets,"We didn't get a no deal Brexit, and what we did get is a pile of shit. Didn't crash the country though, nor would it have."

2021-05-05 15:33:54,wallstreetbets,He is so comically evil but he is a dumb person's idea of a genius so he will continue to get tons of votes in the UK.
2021-05-05 19:23:53,wallstreetbets,"He runs in a conservative safe seat, it's been blue for like the last 200 years or something, you could very literally put the actual reincarnation of Hitler into that seat and he would still be elected."
2021-05-05 16:26:32,wallstreetbets,He gets elected because his constituency is in a very safe blue area. Also Labour have been toss since Gordon Brown
2021-05-05 16:29:55,wallstreetbets,What makes you think he believes that about poor people? It honestly sounds like you just heard his accent and made up your opinion of him based on that
2021-05-05 16:57:12,wallstreetbets,He is the MP for Somerset which is pretty wealthy. Nothing wrong with voting in your own interests
2021-05-05 16:13:23,wallstreetbets,"I dont know england seems to love to let people be ""born better"" than others."

While the ""center right"" wasn't as anti-EU, there has always been an anti-EU faction in the Cons, the ERG has been around since the early 90s, but the grouping existed far before that. 

I don't think the center-left really wanted it either. Looking at Blair or Brown, they were ardent Europhiles, the left was far more eurosceptic (e.g. Corbyn, Benn) (of course even Brown opposed joining the Euro).

Our when tesla buys lithium on the London commodities exchange from an AIM listed mining company for use in their cars made in China I don't think brexit makes much of a difference.  

What I'm saying is that the EU makes up 40% of exports.  But the UK doesn't export anything.  The UK is a finacial services economy,  it facilitates trades,  it doesn't do the trading.  

Yet despite that the UK has a free trade agreement with the EU on 99% of goods with 0% fees,  0% taxes and 0 quotas.  So even if the UK was an export economy,  its still got access to the European single market. Except now its free to create trade agreements with the rest of the world (including the SEA region which is currently host to the QE aircraft carrier) which will only increase its market.  

Brexit was undeniably a good move and I'm going to enjoy the prosperity it brings with an extra bit of smugness knowing that millions of people who call Britain home want nothing more than the UK to fail and for millions to lose their jobs and be homeless because it would prove them right."

2021-05-05 15:15:26,wallstreetbets,Doge pumping recently seems odd when Elon hasn't even tweeted it lol.
2021-05-05 16:02:58,wallstreetbets,Doge dies at a dollar... Then something new will be hot. Probably Hogecoin since it looks similar. It doesn't make sense that's why it makes sense...

2021-05-05 14:55:10,wallstreetbets,What IS?
2021-05-05 18:46:04,wallstreetbets,It’s similar to a hand fudger but slightly lower.
2021-05-05 17:59:00,wallstreetbets,"Bullish on Gme too, personally I am okay with dates because I just know how to keep expectations leveled. I find it more fun in general when I have dates to get excited about even when deep down I know they are bs. 

Obviously I understand this can turn new comers away, but that's not really my problem cause theres plenty of bullish thesis on gme out there that has nothing to do with dates."

In the arts, touring has now been decimated for Uk performers looking to work in the EU, the Erasmus scheme has been eradicated. 
There is literally nothing to fall back on, all of the promises told by Brexit proponents were lies told to short the currency and asset strip the last of the empires treasures to siphon that wealth into offshores. 
To say it can only be judge in the long term is thick in the first place, but it’s quite clear the UK has ruined itself. Scottish independence is highly likely as a direct result of Brexit. The Union may literally cease to exist in the time frame you mentioned.
Brexit is and was retarded with zero quantifiable benefits even now."
2021-05-05 19:00:57,wallstreetbets,"Economists disagree about it sure, but it should be mentioned that a large majority say it was a mistake. 

I think they'll start seeing the effects of it fairly soon as life goes back to normal, but it'll take a while to see the full picture and it won't be great. I've already heard about farmers and the hospitality industry struggling to find workers because workers from the EU now need visas, I've heard about small businesses struggling because they can't reliably export to the EU anymore, and the whole thing happening with fisheries. These may be growing pains but it'll probably cost a good number of people their jobs and businesses. 

It is a great political drama to watch from afar though."

2021-05-05 19:08:25,wallstreetbets,Anybody investing in Doge and NOT planning to sell very soon is an absolute moron. The coin is quite literally designed to go down (unlike Bitchcoin which halves coin output periodically)
2021-05-05 18:46:26,wallstreetbets,Not sure why so many of you think Doge is a bad investment I have great returns and still holding. Surprisingly doge makes more sense as a usable currency than many other crypto.
2021-05-05 16:37:22,wallstreetbets,Damn what's been happening to doge? Finally my meme coins are worth something?
2021-05-05 17:15:20,wallstreetbets,"Fuck Musk. Doge is known globally. It's huge in asia and australia and other places in the non english speaking world. Many of us have been with doge for a long time. 

Musk does fuck all for doge as far as I'm concerned. You think he just has legions of fan boys piling money under their mattresses waiting for him to tell them what to buy? No. 

After bitcoin, Doge is the most popular crypto globally. It's a good price point and has shown it's ability to break out. Doge is up 24,000% for the year and people are still calling it a joke. People love Doge. It's personal and  no surprise that it has been doing well. Furthermore it was tiktok that raised it up at new years. Not Musk

Elon musk doesn't give a fuck about us. Doesn't care about anyone but himself and the credit and hero worship of him needs to go away. 

Doge to one millions

2021-05-05 19:53:20,wallstreetbets,"The company has made a bunch of key changes over the last 6+ months, they still have a ton of cash on hand which they've used to pay off debt, and have already made serious inroads to expanding their online presence including leadership who have extensive experience in the online retail industry. Their quarterly report was not off by much, a far cry from the doomsday scenario many predicted during one of the worst years for brick-and-mortar retail, and they still have a good outlook for the Playstation 5 platform, other consoles, and games in production. 

Their short and mid term value has almost certainly increased significantly. Sure their long term still hangs in the balance and depends on how well they implement the goals they've set and how well the market responds but it's a lot less bleak than many thought a year or two ago.

Put it this way: retail investors don't have the swing they think they have and aren't single handedly supporting a stock that has huge institutional down-pressure. To be where they are now, as steady as it's been for as long as it's been with volume decreasing over the weeks, they have institutional buy in countering the short sellers. Simple as that."

2021-05-05 19:50:55,wallstreetbets,I don’t even know that it’s an inflation hedge tbh. Hasn’t necessarily performed that way lately
2021-05-05 18:31:43,wallstreetbets,"Dogecoin is released at 5 billion a year forever. The supply is infinite but the amount released a year is not. Average lifespans would see 350-400 billion (70-80 years old)  released into the world every lifetime. That's about 57 Dogecoins per person on earth every 70-80 years. Or .71-.81 Dogecoins per person per year. 

The above seems ridiculous I know because obviously not everyone on the planet will be using Doge as currency.  I'm just trying to illustrate that Doge isn't as infinite as you might think when you compare it over your own lifetime. 

I don't know how many could be lost, destroyed or who knows what's to come in the future so I can't figure that into the quick crunch above. 

It's a coin meant for people worldwide as currency not an investment to make more USD"

2021-05-05 16:05:07,wallstreetbets,Try at least 45 DTE and evaluate your position in two-weeks (unless something significant changes). I also like having some puts on companies I think are dogshit just in case of market downturn (NKLA is my favorite punching bag).
2021-05-05 16:17:53,wallstreetbets,I’ve always had better luck selling premium. Wait for a good down day then sell a put spread or cash secured put on a relatively volatile stock. Give it a couple weeks to expiration and sit back and watch the calendar. Rinse and repeat.
2021-05-05 17:37:12,wallstreetbets,"Do something easy to get a feel for it maybe.  Seems like every time trash like NKLA spikes up (isn't often), weekly puts will print.  Also just get 100 shares of tsla and sell weekly calls.  Don't guess or you'll lose. Know."

2021-05-05 14:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Yeah learned this the hard way, and even longer expirations that aren’t LEAPS will give you some breathing room in case your catalyst doesn’t happen.

2021-05-05 13:49:36,wallstreetbets,I generally don't do weeklies unless I feel like gambling. I bought most of my calls weeks ago when valuations were crazy high

2021-05-05 13:19:45,wallstreetbets,The act of borrowing shares and selling them or selling synthetic shares should be outlawed. We’re one of the few countries who practice this bs because it’s total bulls.hit. Nobody knows the true value of any stock due to the shorting practices out there.

2021-05-05 13:46:01,wallstreetbets,"Right?!? The argument for short selling is normally blah blah blah provides liquidity, blah blah blah improves price discovery. It literally makes true price discovery impossible. A shit load of financial formulas have shares outstanding in the denominator. Since the shares outstanding is completely manipulated by the added supply of phantom shares, those formulas get thrown out the window. They are useless since we can't know the true number of shares both phantom and real outstanding. What a mess."
2021-05-05 17:12:27,wallstreetbets,"wasn't there a proposed rule that would ""mark"" any share that has been borrowed/lent, and render it un-borrowable so that shares can only be lent once?"

2021-05-05 19:53:45,wallstreetbets,Wow....now this is that beautiful balls deep helmet-wearing-shortbus-riding-retard shit I come here to see.
2021-05-05 14:43:07,wallstreetbets,"The problem I have with AMD, and I like the stock generally, is that it was $10 in 2018. Their revenue has doubled since (helped by GPU sales which will drop now with eth2) but I don't see why that would lead to a 8, 10, 12x stock price growth."
2021-05-05 13:10:24,wallstreetbets,We buy high and sell on URANUS
2021-05-05 13:15:44,wallstreetbets,Literally can't go tits up

2021-05-05 16:27:50,wallstreetbets,I will hold the line keep all the bears out AMD IS GOING UP 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-05 16:19:15,wallstreetbets,"It was also at $30 in 2018. You're literally looking at the lowest point in the year when the market only knew the numbers from 2017, when AMD was barely profitable."
2021-05-05 15:45:10,wallstreetbets,I think In december. Possibly.
2021-05-05 16:35:39,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. The other thing going against AMD long term is much of its profit is tied up in GPUs, which have been in high demand due to etherium mining. I know I bought 16 of them a couple years ago at a premium. But with eth2 coming mining will be ending, driving down demand.

Anyway I don't know which way it's going to break so I've got some July 110 calls and 55 puts."
2021-05-05 12:55:22,wallstreetbets,Why WDC instead of STX?
2021-05-05 16:46:02,wallstreetbets,It’s called the cloud
2021-05-05 13:00:51,wallstreetbets,"I find WDC to be cheaper overall, give STX recent runup, and their hard drives are much more suited for mining. However, both will benefit from a shortage. STX right now is on a downtrend, mean while WDC seems to stay flat for the past few months. I think both earnings will be great without a doubt."
2021-05-05 18:18:18,wallstreetbets,"The cloud is already in play for people that use, and people that don't use, won't switch over to it because it hasn't fundamentally change in the past 2-3 years. You can't run most games off the cloud, nor can you mine off the cloud. The cloud isn't a high speed center for applications or large files."

2021-05-05 19:08:22,wallstreetbets,"My opinion is that if it's being shorted right now after the way retail punished GME shorting, people should put their positions aside in their minds and think about why anyone would do that. 

There are several reasons GME went to the moon. 1) The environment created by COVID. People had time on their hands, they were indoors and frustrated and it created a prime environment to rile them up to fight [insert thing they find deplorable: racism, greedy rich people, etc]. 2) A leader came along at the right time and won big from this environment. White, male, attractive, familiar with meme internet culture - a sort of techno-populist. Pushes a shorted stock in the perfect position for to lose in a retail battle, and his target audience is the same kind of audience that likes video games He was credited and adored by those who won big, and those who held him responsible in any way for their losses were mocked and silenced. 

Thoughts on it now? It's been trading sideways for a good while, and if anything other than sideways, it looks like a downtrend. Maybe people buying now will make a 15% profit if they sell tomorrow. Or maybe they'll make a 30% profit if they hold for 5 years and miss out on a thousand swing opportunities with that capital. They're trying to transform the company and maybe they'll manage to do that. Or maybe people who buy today will just lose 40% tomorrow and have to wait another year just to get back to where they started.  I don't have a crystal ball and anyone who acts like they do shouldn't be trusted. They'll shout through a megaphone about what they were right about and bury what they were wrong about. But I'm not buying back in now. The chances of it being a stupid losing move are too damn high. I trade volatile stocks. As a swing trader, I love them. But I like to swing trade, not baghold. For FOMO mitigation, I keep a small portion of most stocks I trade in my retirement account. A lot of people here do FOMO YOLOs and lose everything. They'll get some meme ape praises and then they're out of the game and dealing with the burden resulting from emotional trading. 

Regarding whether GME can transform the company, when it comes to spending money, customers will ultimately buy the best product at the best price and only time will tell if a company that has made consistently bad choices over the years can change that. There are other stocks with less risk and better likeliness of mooning. 

What are your thoughts?"
2021-05-05 17:39:10,wallstreetbets,"Cute.

But to elaborate, since now it's *clear* you're confused: No one thinks GME is *worth* infinite money. You're mistaking that with the fact that there is infinite *loss potential* in shorting a stock.

The prevailing thought right now is that once everything settles down after the squeeze, GME will be worth something in the 200-400 range, given that they've eliminated all their debt, cut dead weight in leadership, started a pivot to e-commerce, confirmed a new 700,000sqft fulfillment center, and are about to report quarterly earnings between $1.14B and $1.24B. 

You less confused now? I know you're still a dickhead, but hopefully now you're a less confused dickhead."
2021-05-05 13:23:51,wallstreetbets,My pleasure.
2021-05-05 14:49:21,wallstreetbets,Thanks to GME now I can count until 10 million.

2021-05-05 19:33:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you asked for ""opinions"" and didn't specify on what, just that it's shorted. You got what you asked for and now you're whining about it. I see from your profile that you're a bagholder, so it makes sense.

Ask yourself how much of it was shorted a few months ago and how much is shorted now. Then look at where the price is now and the fact that it's still not being covered at this price. That'll tell you where it's headed."

2021-05-05 14:11:29,wallstreetbets,"Every TLRY/APHA, ACB, SNDL post gets the automatic: ""DoNt YoU KnOw ThEy'Re CaNaDiAn?"" We know they're Canadian...we also know they have, as you put it, a half decade head start on anything in the states. Also, Canada has always had a reputation for amazing weed. People think we're not going to smoke Canadian bud when it's legalized in the states? We don't stop imports of beer or wine from other countries...We import 75% of all of Mexico's beer into the states. Not understanding why people think this would be different. In fact, the DEA has already allowed TLRY & ACB to export cannabis for medical trials. I don't have a crystal ball, but knowing that I'd expect they would be allowed in. These companies will definitely get a lift and with the head start and reputation I'm betting people will buy. I mean, watch the documentary ""Murder Mountain"" or ""Sasquatch"" that's who you are betting on in the USA market....Until they're bought out by the big money/Koch Bros of course."
2021-05-05 13:22:18,wallstreetbets,My weed stocks have been red for a long time I need some green soon.
2021-05-05 12:39:14,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the post! You have a compelling argument!
2021-05-05 14:00:21,wallstreetbets,Bag hold'n ACB since Sep 2018... Here's hoping you are right. Can't wait to recover some and gtfo of this position. Literally the only position I'm sitting on that I constantly regret...
2021-05-05 13:49:20,wallstreetbets,"Most of the big multi state weed companies that have gone public are owned, operated, and funded by the same hedge fund people you guys are fighting in the first place. I've been in the legal cannabis industry for over a decade as a master cultivator and breeder of cannabis. I have helped design and build a dispensary in Massachusetts from the ground up and got suckered by my own business partners. Now I'm locked in a petty lawsuit trying to recover my investments and equity. The industry as a whole is basically a shit-show of corruption. 

The smartest investment you can make in this industry is NOT in the stocks, it is in the smaller mom and pop store fronts and craft cannabis sites. Even if you dumped a few million in to a smaller cultivation build out your returns will be massive. Social Equity is huge and there are a ton of groups looking for funding. Obtaining a dispensary license in Massachusetts is pretty easy as long as the capital is there especially for Social Equity participants as they have priority in the application queue. After your first few crops you are basically printing money and the license that maybe cost 4 to 7 mil is now worth 50mil or more. 

The best part about this industry is that many places suck a growing cannabis on a large scale. 90% of dispensaries get it wrong but even with garbage flower there is still huge profits being made."
2021-05-05 13:24:30,wallstreetbets,What is your advice on GME? It’s currently 70% of my portfolio but I’m wondering if i should diversify more
2021-05-05 14:25:15,wallstreetbets,People are really underestimating the power of existing supply chains
2021-05-05 14:43:02,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t TLRY have some headquarters in the US that would make it way easier for them to sell in the US once it’s legalized?
2021-05-05 13:24:28,wallstreetbets,It's mostly a volume and short interest issue. Low volumes with high short interests kill stocks.
2021-05-05 12:40:35,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! I've posted in daily threads a lot. Probably more than I should about ACB, lol, and I've come up against this argument a couple times, so I really wanted to just air my full opinion on it in fully constructed post."
2021-05-05 14:13:01,wallstreetbets,"That's rough buddy, my position is newer, but I'm holding strong for guys like you. I like the stock 🤷‍♂️"
2021-05-05 13:30:15,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I can't really offer you financial advice. I missed the GME craze, but overall 70 percent is a big risk. I believe in taking risks, but if you think should diversify, then it's not a bad idea to pick emerging or established markets, whether that be cannabis, tech, etc."
2021-05-05 14:58:22,wallstreetbets,"Before the merger APHA purchased Sweetwater, a CBD/THC drink company in the USA, which should give TLRY easier access to the market. Heard a lot of trash talk about CBD/THC drinks on the sub...really think people are missing the mark on these. If you're in the Portland/Oregon area, Rogue Brewery is making a line of these and they're goddamn incredible. I love me some booze, but THC drinks are going to be the future, especially for people who are looking to go non-alcoholic/take it easy for the night...no one here on this sub will understand that, but it's something to think about. I didn't understand it until I tried it, I really think it has a bright future that people are grossly underestimating. I haven't tried Sweetwater, but if it's anything like the Rogue ones I've tried...you should be excited."
2021-05-05 14:55:07,wallstreetbets,TLRY acquired sweetwater which is a craft beer chain for cannabis infused drinks. they also have Manitoba harvest which already distributes cbd hemp products in the US. So they have some infrastructure with access to the US market already.

2021-05-05 12:51:15,wallstreetbets,"How to get rich:

1) Pick an industry/technology in a bubble that few normal people understand well (LiDAR)

2) Buy a stock in (x) company and convince the reddit masses that their LiDAR is “best in class” even though they have no LiDAR products or customers, and it took them 5 years to even make a LiDAR prototype. Fail to mention that LiDAR is a small, crowded industry with already established major players.

3) Sell your bags to a bigger idiot once the stock reaches absurd amounts."

2021-05-05 16:55:43,wallstreetbets,Never investing in this long term unless it hits $5 or less. Until then everytime it hits $15 plus just buy puts and sell same day for 20% gain.

2021-05-05 13:09:02,wallstreetbets,"They think that the company’s LiDAR initiative will become wildly successful. But this company is already years behind the rest of the field, under-capitalized, and has no relationships with any automakers. Assuming that they are even able to come up with a finished product to sell (which is a big if) and any automakers are interested (even bigger if) there’s nothing to justify the price that it’s at right now.

Also this company has a track record of failing to deliver for 30 years so there’s that."

2021-05-05 13:49:50,wallstreetbets,They literally have the best LiDAR technology in the industry and just finished development of their A-Sample. Do you know how to use google?
2021-05-05 14:44:52,wallstreetbets,"They don’t even make the component you’re talking about, they just license their IP to a (single) customer. They weren’t even able to manufacture components without incurring a gross loss on product which is terrible if they are expected to have an exponentially growing, industry-leading LiDAR product in the near future as their current share price suggests.

They made 479k off of licensing last quarter, their only source of income. There’s little demand for their patents out there."
2021-05-05 15:26:18,wallstreetbets,Thanks for all the kind words
2021-05-05 14:20:44,wallstreetbets,So when do you think this company will start showing revenue?
2021-05-05 14:37:57,wallstreetbets,">best LiDAR technology in the industry

Everyone on WSB seems to be saying that. Professional analysts who actually know what they are talking about, not so much. 

Also congrats to them for finally finishing a LiDAR prototype after 5 years. They have a lot of catching up to do in a very crowded industry."

I’ve been doing research around automotive LiDAR specifically for the past 2 years of my life, so I’d like to think I know what I’m talking about. If the claims Microvision made about their A-Sample are legitimate, they have the best system on the market by far. But again, what would I know about the industry right?"

2021-05-05 17:02:36,wallstreetbets,"They have a long history of claiming that they have groundbreaking tech that doesn’t turn into any monetization (see PicoP) so I’d take any claims they make with a grain of salt. Would this “product” (prototype) that they have be cost-effective as well for automakers? Sometimes even if a product is technically the “best” on paper it’s not feasible for mass-manufacture or scalability.

Also MVIS can’t manufacture for shit, given their previous inability to manufacture at a positive gross profit which led them to cease manufacturing entirely. There’s no indication that they’d be able to manufacture any of this to scale either. They literally have a book value of 3 million in long term assets lol. No company is going to buy them at a 3 billion valuation, or whatever absurd valuation you people think this company is worth."

**never short the S&P500**"
2021-05-05 13:26:29,wallstreetbets,"Another issue I've noticed trading S&P unlimited turbos is that it's technically a bad indicator to short, because it never dips too low. To get significant dollar gains, you need insane leverage, and leverage is expensive. At 2.5% interest and 10x leverage, you essentially have a loan with 25% APR. So, you're almost certainly going to consign your capital to theta decay. What's worse, all peaks accelerate this. I've been better off shorting something with an inherently higher volatility like individual stocks and gold."

SUMMER. what do people do in the summer they build shit! rich people can care less if they lose an extra 5k on building a house for ex. i seen a bullish run on this lumber stock, especually till end of summer. 

Not to mention canfor has a great company also in mist of connections etc."
2021-05-05 13:13:35,wallstreetbets,"The supercommodity thesis of 2018 that turned out to be bunk has everyone believing that this inflation is going be transitory and these companies will go back to losing money next year.

Either the inflation is not transitory and the price of lumber remains high and these companies moon, or inflation is transitory as the fed is saying and these companies drop.

So big upside potential, also huge downside."
2021-05-05 13:41:26,wallstreetbets,"Whenever people are talking about lumber stocks and mention a low PE, the trade is beginning to get stretched.

Typical lumber cycle is quick and dirty.  Wood prices high, bring back online old mills, flood the market with inventory, price goes back down, nobody wants to shut their mill and pay severance, loss making cycle begins... people stop talking about earnings again."
2021-05-05 14:26:38,wallstreetbets,"Oregon fires last year burned down one of our biggest producers of lumber. Old growth lumber is becoming non existent. Those prices are probably inflated because contractors had existing contracts with clauses that forced them to finish even with prices climbing. Add in the renovation boom with stimmy checks, supply line disruptions etc. 

Copper pipe I have watched go up from 16$ for 10ft to 31$
Mapp gas is unavailable at home depot and lowes in Southern California for a few months now. Random stuff just not being restocked still. But all of this is happening while demand is climbing. So supply down demand up prices sky rockets. You are probably right that it will bust all at once. People out of stimmy money, company’s out of existing contracts. Supply lines and production pick back up."
2021-05-05 15:27:14,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, the lumber brokers are currently controlling the prices more than any sawmill. They’re currently limiting supply to keep prices high. Which is basically what you’re seeing on the graph. In my opinion sawmills are doing good not great it’s the brokers who are benefiting from the manipulative pricing of lumber."

2021-05-05 12:38:18,wallstreetbets,Market is going to be flooded with lumber in the near future I think. All the mills are starting to run and lots of people are clear cutting their personal properties to try capitalize on the high price for logs. I don’t think the lumber rush will last too long.

2021-05-05 13:17:34,wallstreetbets,Yeah this is just price fixing and it's causing high imports too the bastards
2021-05-05 12:57:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I've seen something to that effect too.... Sawmills are the only beneficiary. That's why I'm suggesting sawmill companies... Those are just printing cash hand over fist in the current environment."
2021-05-05 14:17:46,wallstreetbets,150-300% where I live-- Home Depot is the only place with decent prices (I assume it's because they can survive with lower margins). Local lumber yards are 200-300%.
2021-05-05 12:31:08,wallstreetbets,Fact
2021-05-05 12:19:34,wallstreetbets,[CFP.TO](https://CFP.TO) or CFPZF on US pinksheet... But same could be said of any lumber sawmill company... Interfor? West Fraser?
2021-05-05 15:05:52,wallstreetbets,I agree... I just think there is a massive runway once we pass the 2018 peeks in the share price. I'm personally astonished that we aren't 30% higher already with the price of lumber where it is and the past quarters of heavy earnings. The balance sheet are becoming ridiculously beautiful.
2021-05-05 15:08:44,wallstreetbets,"That's a good point. Suppose inflation is transitory and the price drops back to like 600$ on the lumber contracts for the next 2-3 years, call it ""transition time"" these companies are still making massive profits then... The have negative earnings/cashflow the price of lumber would have to fall back to like 300$, not sure how reasonable it is to expect that for the next few years after this massive run up."
2021-05-05 17:18:55,wallstreetbets,"True... The cyclical nature of it is harsh...But it's been a good year and looks like a very positive year on the horizon... With lumber prices continuously improving. Whatever negative earnings they've had since 2018, sawmills will have recouped all losses and be sitting on very healthy balance sheets.   


Bottom line, I feel like the equities deserve a much better SP than that of 2018. But that's my personal opinion."
2021-05-05 17:22:00,wallstreetbets,"We'll have to wait and see... Taking out of Canada, housing demand is ridiculously strong and I don't see how it would ever slow down now... The Governments really did everything necessary to avoid a housing crash during the darkest times in 2020. I think it's just inflation playing catch-up and I don't see it slowing down."
2021-05-05 17:23:11,wallstreetbets,"What does a lumber broker do exactly?   
Buy in masse from the sawmills and sends it to the retailer through a funnel that they artificially create?"
2021-05-05 12:32:55,wallstreetbets,"Cool... Elaborate, why is that? The economy re-opening and vaccination rate improving the travelling prospect, deterring people from doing home improvement and collapsing demand?"
2021-05-05 12:34:30,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the hard stuff... not weak spaghetti soft type such as plywood."
2021-05-05 12:37:41,wallstreetbets,"Lol, that move since the 2020 low is so insanely parabolic... Yet equities have barely moved... I get that lumber price will probably go down eventually, but the equities deserve a better multiple...They've haven't moved since 2018 despite being 1 year into into the parabolic spike."
2021-05-05 12:42:45,wallstreetbets,"Could be... I suspect there is a current shadow cartel where the sawmills collectively and intentionally avoid a ridiculous production ramp up to avoid a crash and to capitalize on the situation... Such as that cartel that exists within the potash market, for exemple."
2021-05-05 17:23:45,wallstreetbets,"Always a possibility, indeed."

2021-05-05 15:02:21,wallstreetbets,"Hey Tyr, thanks for elaborating... I'm with Luka here and don't get the argument. Wouldn't inflation be beneficial here? 

&#x200B;

The companies have valuable lumber resources and assets (land) that would increase in value along with the price of lumber and be an hedge to a collapsing dollar? At least that's how I see it...   


I get that demand would fall but how would it crater it so low? Also, I think the mid year contracts just reflect uncertainty as to where prices will be then. Demand is high and re-opening of the economy could slow demand just like it could accelerate it. I would see the re-opening economy increase the demand as a lot of housing projects and such would just increase?"
2021-05-05 15:08:53,wallstreetbets,"No memes sooo there is not a lumber shortage. There isn’t. Call up your lumber yard. They have lumber but the pricing is out of whack. You can get xyz but you will pay a premium. You can argue that logistics play a part but then we need to talk about budgets and employment which is a hiring issue. 

Now one could argue that all the “hobby” work is done. The “builder” side of things is more complicated as new housing is leaning on demand which is generated by SECONDARY market buyer (not first time buyers but investors) and the sales and loans are down (this is why I am bearish on RKT).

If and when the economy reopens (say Fall) the demand will drop. 

You will see a market adjustment mid May into June based on what I see in the futures and commodities market."

2021-05-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,How to Margin: Not exciting but great to offset your bets. 
2021-05-05 12:01:34,wallstreetbets,You are using margin to buy stocks with high yield to pay off the Robinhood gold and interest ?Is your net amount like 2% after the gold payment and interest?
2021-05-05 12:02:21,wallstreetbets,"Don't throw margin on calls. Put that shit in a regular dividend stock and forget about it, unless you have gains. I recommend PSEC and ORC. ORC is a good buy right now: returns .5 cents higher than PSEC/share, lower cost and at a relative low. 

PSEC has been solid for me, and covers my Robinhood 2.5% annual margin fee, plus extra shares. This 2.5% rate is the only reason I'm still in Robinhood. I might be an idiot, but I'm up 318% for the year. 

That $650 comes in monthly and buys more shares for more return the next month. Also, it consists of 37% of my portfolio, the other 3% of margin is in various other dividend stocks (GROW, NOBL, ORC, ARR, OXSQ)."
2021-05-05 12:53:43,wallstreetbets,My free robinhood stock was psec so i get $0.06/month from it. Am i doing it right?
2021-05-05 12:05:03,wallstreetbets,Is PSEC divvy qualified?
2021-05-05 12:55:35,wallstreetbets,"Huh. I like this. 

I like this way more than i should."
2021-05-05 12:01:22,wallstreetbets,Puts my 37p dividend payment to absolute shame
2021-05-05 13:38:56,wallstreetbets,This was my free robinhood stocks. I tried to buy 1000 8 calls for august 21 but robinhood wouldnonly fill them at .05 instead of a penny. Woulda been an easy 40 bagger as those calls are at 50 cents or so now.
2021-05-05 13:56:08,wallstreetbets,Upcoming Activity: Canceled dividend payout.
2021-05-05 12:05:01,wallstreetbets,That's about right.
2021-05-05 12:04:01,wallstreetbets,"Right, forgot to mention that with that $650/month dividend comes another 40% you can put in from margin."
2021-05-05 13:57:54,wallstreetbets,">I might be an idiot, but I'm up 318% for the year.

That's kind of the truth about stonks right now."
2021-05-05 12:15:14,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure. Even if it is, and you might be losing a little on capital gains, you still have stock to sell that will print more dividends. Great question, damn it."
2021-05-05 13:46:53,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't buy options on dividend stocks. They're supposed to be relatively stable, and you miss out on the dividends. PSEC has been a bit of a unicorn this year. If it doesn't move, you're missing out/just losing."
2021-05-05 13:58:07,wallstreetbets,"Been on this experiment since December. It can happen, but hasn't yet."
2021-05-05 13:40:51,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the reply. I was thinking about doing the same thing. One question I have is , when is the margin due? Or it’s not due as long as you are within the requirement and pay the interest and gold account fee?"
2021-05-05 12:55:54,wallstreetbets,"A 300% return is fantastic, but I’m going to try and poke holes in your strategy anyways, trying to help you see what you might be over looking:

I think the strategy here falls apart when you look at this through a long term lens, as all investors/traders must do. 

If you look at the 5yr for PSEC, ORC, or really most other REITS like ARR or O, you are not beating the market through appreciation of value. In fact, in some cases (such as ORC), your losing appreciation while they feed you a dividend to keep you happy instead of investing it back into the business, which would reward investors through appreciation of value. 

When you DRIP your dividends, your not coming out with more value. Your shares lose value by the dollar amount of the dividend when they are paid out. So, if a stock is 1$, and they pay a .05 dividend, which you use to buy more shares, you end up with 1$ worth of stock, not $1.05. This is because the shares decrease in value by $.05 cents on pay date ((1-.05)+.05)).

Not to mention, your paying taxes on those dividends, leaving you here with a negative ROI, and the fee for margin in your case which, although paid for by the amount of dividends your receiving, is not a few dollars here or there, but rather thousands of dollars in interest. 

I’m going to run some numbers to show you what I mean:

In this screenshot, we see you own $87,818.00 in PSEC which compromises 37.64% of your portfolio. This means your total portfolio including margin is worth somewhere around $237,345.00.

Since this is WSB, and based on your strategy described, I’m going to assume half of that is margin, meaning your using $118,672.00 of margin. At 2.5% APY, you owe $2,966.00 per year (rounded up to $3,000.00)

Assuming the entire portfolio is in dividends and REITS, we can guess and say you get a 6.0% dividend yield on your entire portfolio (usually around 4.3%-5.0%, but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt here and use 6.0% since your in some high dividend names). $237,345.00 x 6% = $14,240.00 in dividends each year.

Okay, time for taxes, assuming you are in the 15% tax bracket for dividends: $14,240.00 x 15% = $2,136.00 owed in taxes. Your dividend subtotal is now $12,104.00.

Okay, time to pay RH. $12,104.00 - $3,000.00 = $9,104.00, your net amount.

To find your ROI: ($9,104.00 / $237,345.00)x100= 3.8% return

If you had just put that amount into the SP500, assuming a capital gains tax of 22%, and the same amount owed in margin, you would have on an average year (10% return) made $15,513.00."
2021-05-05 14:16:06,wallstreetbets,So this is like an income stream for you? And you grow it out from PSEC? Not a bad play
2021-05-05 14:32:40,wallstreetbets,It’s up about 100% per year. I was watching it for months and wanted to buy in before it hit $7 even. Woulda been a killer bag but oh well.
2021-05-05 13:43:59,wallstreetbets,"RH takes monthly, however when dividends hit, it just takes away from the buying power you already have."
2021-05-05 13:11:10,wallstreetbets,I just seen you run this numbers on the board.
2021-05-05 14:53:21,wallstreetbets,"Margin and RH fees are tax deductible. So your pretax income is only 11k, that means you can qualify for another 44k in mortgage just from your dividend income. This adds up in a few years so you can get a rental property every year or so in some Midwest location."
2021-05-05 13:45:49,wallstreetbets,How much does Robinhood let you borrow? 25% of your account value ?
2021-05-05 13:48:06,wallstreetbets,I think it's tiered to 40%
2021-05-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Might be time for us apes to throw some money into $CRSR 🚀🚀

This is the only stock I have shares in that I don't sell calls on, simply because I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING (cept puts, sell em all day). I'm waiting for the options chain to get extended so I can roll out the Nov leaps I bought after IPO.

I got 1175 at $17.5 and 900 at $33....  I can ride this out for as long as it takes.  It should be $50 and I am pissed it's taking so long is all.

2021-05-05 12:08:59,wallstreetbets,You already are. Your pick on CRSR before its astronomical rise in the making was your approval.

2021-05-05 15:34:51,wallstreetbets,Good way to put it. Super frustrating. I feel like everything has been off ever since crypto started pumping.

2021-05-05 15:36:00,wallstreetbets,I personally believe (not advice) crypto could end badly and take the market down a leg with it.
2021-05-05 12:15:48,wallstreetbets,Yeah actually looking at it but i think 40-50 is its peaks really.   Seems to have good divs
2021-05-05 12:19:03,wallstreetbets,Upper 40's seems fair to me and I'd be happy with that; especially in the short-term if it happened to play out that way.
2021-05-05 12:25:32,wallstreetbets,There isn't any dividends...
2021-05-05 16:11:13,wallstreetbets,Lol right...looking at to many charts and thought the div said 1.12.  I need a break from this for a while
2021-05-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ACCD - Accolade Bull Case I think Accolade is positioning themselves to be the biggest player in the US telemedicine space.

Accolade is an insurance benefits company - they are that 800 number on the back of your insurance card who can walk you through what your health insurance benefits are, connect you with resources, give clinical guidance, care management, pharmacy benefits, find providers for you, etc. [https://accolade.com/](https://accolade.com/) They provide benefits for employees at several major corporations including:  Comcast Cable, American Airlines, Lowe's, Facebook, and State Farm as well as federal contracts [https://ir.accolade.com/news-releases/news-release-details/defense-health-agency-selects-accolade-provide-military-families](https://ir.accolade.com/news-releases/news-release-details/defense-health-agency-selects-accolade-provide-military-families)

They just announced their intent to acquire PlushCare, a primary care telemedicine company that has grown 10x since covid [https://accolade.com/blogs/announce-acquisition-plushcare-primary-care/](https://accolade.com/blogs/announce-acquisition-plushcare-primary-care/)

And just prior to that they acquired 2nd MD, a telemedicine specialty care company that connects people to specialists. [https://accolade.com/blogs/accolade-acquires-2ndmd/](https://accolade.com/blogs/accolade-acquires-2ndmd/)

With these acquisitions Accolade can take all of their benefits subscribers and refer them in-house to doctors with PlushCare and 2nd MD. That potentially makes them not only the largest telemedicine provider, but the largest medical provider of any kind in the US.

Currently Accolade is trading around $46, which I think is severely undervalued, especially when you look at teledoc at $159. I think they could easily be trading at $60-70 short term and over $100 within a year.

Accolade earnings today (5/5) after close, get in while you can :)

2021-05-05 11:10:17,wallstreetbets,It’s pretty impressive how they have built a “cult-like” following for an exercise machine.
2021-05-05 11:23:55,wallstreetbets,I see the recall as a “buy the dip”. But I think peloton was already overvalued.   The whole “people are not going to go back to the gym” is Bs.   My gym is packed.   Peloton will be around for a while but imho I’m staying away
2021-05-05 11:53:41,wallstreetbets,My puts are printing. Might close them out today because I think Peloton is gonna make a strong comeback.
2021-05-05 11:20:56,wallstreetbets,So is there something different with their treadmill compared to every other treadmill?
2021-05-05 11:12:48,wallstreetbets,The dip is there for the taking
2021-05-05 11:06:58,wallstreetbets,So you're telling us to buy.

In the short-term, they’re going to kill the earnings again tomorrow. Also, Cathie is going to double down on them, pushing the momentum even higher. 

Over the long-term, they’re chilling either way if the reopening is a success or not. They bought Precor, one of the largest equipment suppliers for commercial gyms, hotels, college campuses, military, etc. If the trend towards home fitness continues, they’ll have even an even better supply system with Precor helping out. They literally cannot make enough bikes for all the people who want them. That’s a pretty good place for a growing company to be."

I bought Peloton puts the first day the notice came out about the child that had a fatal accident on a Peloton. 

I am a pretty new investor and of course at the time I thought I was being a genius.

Just want some commentary or input so I don't make the same mistakes again...and also maybe some tips or advice on how to dampen this situation...

So basically on that first day, I bought over 20 put option contracts...but I chose the same expiration date for all of them.... which was 4/30.

&#x200B;

Literally today, 5 days later, Peloton falls 13%.

&#x200B;

As a brand new investor (opened my robinhood account in February) you can probably tell how frustrated I got...

Yeah the treadmills are not a big part of sales but that’s a lot of overpriced treadmills out there non the less. I’m sure earning will beat the shit out of projections I’m curious to see about guidance, they will have to mention this fiasco and here lately good earnings haven’t been an automatic pay day."
2021-05-05 17:58:27,wallstreetbets,this is definitely not a buy the dip situation with their earnings tomorrow.
2021-05-05 18:39:48,wallstreetbets,"Check their social media, very little talk about anyone returning their treadmills. Besides the fact that treadmills account for about 2% of sales. This is so overblown."

2021-05-05 12:35:44,wallstreetbets,"Don’t forget that Peloton also bought Precor, thus locking down the reopening! Precor is one the largest suppliers of gym equipment for commercial gyms, hotels, colleges, military bases, etc.!"
2021-05-05 13:33:10,wallstreetbets,"Prior to Covid one of the Nurse Practitioners I worked with told me about her Peloton bike and how she used it religiously for exercise and training when the weather sucked. She also hated going to the gym because of her work schedule. Same with her doctor and PA coworkers. She was the reason I bought the stock after it IPO’ed. 

There are plenty of people who don’t want to go to the gym or can’t and have the money to afford premium equipment. The ability to compete and interact with other people is what really fosters the community and cult-like following IMO. PTON has benefited greatly from this pandemic and I believe there is still more growth potential post-pandemic if they execute things right."
2021-05-05 11:38:22,wallstreetbets,It’s 100% bullshit. My gym has been packed full since it was allowed to open again.

2021-05-05 19:56:07,wallstreetbets,I bought in the dip today.
2021-05-05 15:36:14,wallstreetbets,"Buying Peloton without understanding that its current value is lockdown dependent is dumb - I'd argue we've already seen that value leave in Feb/March. 

That said, it's now well-placed to dictate how the home gym will move forward, and made its own space in a usually tight market. Even if lockdown culture is done (plz), it looks like provisions for homeworking are set to stay, especially in the context of middle-class office work (i.e. the exact sort of crowd two which Peloton is trying to hawk its dumb, overpriced murder-bikes )."
2021-05-05 11:24:46,wallstreetbets,Other treadmills have a cover over both the rounded ends of the machine. These prevent kids from getting pulled underneath.
2021-05-05 12:03:35,wallstreetbets,The edge of the treadmill is super beefy which creates extra surface area and friction. It then goes on to roll right over them like a tank.
2021-05-05 12:10:25,wallstreetbets,The price $$$$$$$
2021-05-05 11:42:24,wallstreetbets,"Their dumb asses thought it was a good idea to not cover the treadmill belt for aesthetics. Yeah, it looks nice… but you now have two exposed ends of a hi speed belt so anything that gets in the way gets pulled under."

2021-05-05 16:01:12,wallstreetbets,Yea makes sense or really anything to block the rear of the treadmill while in use. But this should go for any treadmill around kids and animals

2021-05-05 12:30:24,wallstreetbets,I really hate that we live in a world where Peloton is liable for stuff like this. Back in my day when I played near my dad's equipment the belt would come out.
2021-05-05 18:20:40,wallstreetbets,Gyms may be open up Peloton target demographic is professionals who can afford a 4k treadmill. Many are still not returning to work abs the gym was something they did either in the office gym or on their way there or home. With more offices allowing remote work i don't think the targeted demographic is headed to the gym at the same rates as other demographics
2021-05-05 11:44:45,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, PTON will blow out estimates and this re-dip really was priced in with the original news."

2021-05-05 12:34:52,wallstreetbets,"Yep, the downside to being a meme company is you're scrutinized a lot more than the rest."
2021-05-05 13:57:14,wallstreetbets,"One time, at the gym, I got on a treadmill. It was crowded and a spot opened up between these two ridiculously hot girls who were both jogging along at a slow pace. Seizing the opportunity like a boss, I got going at a slow running speed. 

I was at the peak of my fitness. I kept up that pace for quite a while which was pretty good for me since I wasn't usually a runner. Made it look easy. The women next to me and everyone else behind me were obviously impressed. 

Just when I was thinking about letting these two girls have a threesome with me, I tripped on my shoelace. One knee hit the belt, then the other, then before my hand could catch myself I went flying off the back and rolled on the floor into the treadmill behind me. Everyone laughed, but they were all just jealous. One of the girls shouted ""OH MY GOD!? ARE YOU OKAY!??"" then had to stop her treadmil because she was laughing so hard.

Thanks to my cat-like reflexes, I didn't break anything like a normal average human would have. I jumped right up, got back on the treadmill and said something like ""I'm fine, it happens all the time.""  The girl looked me up and down to admire my physique then said, ""You're bleeding.""  I looked down and sure enough I had scraped off the top layers of my knee caps. I said, ""Oh, I'll be alright.""

So then I got back on the treadmill in the coolest way possible and continued running. The other girl was laughing so hard that she had to stop too and walked away. Or maybe she was just intimidated by my quick recovery and inspiring display of resilience. I went for another couple of minutes until I could feel the blood running down my shins, then figured I'd better stop since I'm so considerate of others and the cleanliness of the facilities."
2021-05-05 18:22:53,wallstreetbets,"22,000 people USED to get injured every year by treadmills. Now thanks to Peloton, that figure is 44,000!"
2021-05-05 13:39:49,wallstreetbets,"And did all of them remove safety features so it looks ""nicer""?  


Accidents happen but what heppened here wasn't accidents it's willful negligence from the company choseing to make a worse and more dangerous product only to make it more visually appealing."
2021-05-05 12:35:54,wallstreetbets,Wonder how many babies get killed by them though.
2021-05-05 16:36:03,wallstreetbets,"Deadmill, deadkill, or brown bread meal for a cockney"

2021-05-05 13:46:10,wallstreetbets,"They are very well built. However, they are still way too expensive. You can get a better workout buying a damn jump rope. Additionally, the $40 a month fee is too high for the mediocre classes they offer. If you don’t pay the fee you have to sit there riding in silence. Since you cannot play your own music off the speakers. You also have a massive screen that can only be used for Peloton. Which means no YouTube or Apple fitness. 

They had great marketing during COVID. I just don’t see sales improving much with gyms opening back up."
2021-05-05 14:14:19,wallstreetbets,A solid treadmill really can make a difference. I think we tried two cheap-ish consumer models before I sucked it up and bought a Landice. It's been a fucking champ for the last 4 years.

2021-05-05 16:13:12,wallstreetbets,"So has mine. So much so that I generally dont tell people what gym I work out at (at least locally). Once gyms were initially allowed to open back up here in WA state, they tried rolling all that back, and my gym just said fuck it and stayed open. Literally everyone who ran into the owner there personally thanked him for it."
2021-05-05 15:42:34,wallstreetbets,"Subscriptions are the devil as a consumer but hot damn if they don't represent relatively secure income for investors.

I've never once bought something from a store by forgetting about it. Subscriptions flip that entirely - there's now a billion dollar industry dedicated to implicitly providing nothing to millions of people.

I can actually see this turning south in a few years once governments  implement non-use auto-cancellation policies in the name of consumer protection. First we're gonna read some stories about vulnerable people being exploited though - it's bank fees all over again, really."
2021-05-05 12:36:16,wallstreetbets,Most chain gyms like LA Fitness still use wholesale commercial equipment.
2021-05-05 11:42:39,wallstreetbets,Seems like they should be able to just roll out a modification with a guard vs. picking them all up from homes...if everyone takes the refund though that's a $500M cash outflow / loss of consumer confidence

When they were going through their finances they had tons of subscriptions (some of them duplicates) that were basically just eating their entire social security checks and either they didnt know or couldn't figure out how to cancel them.  It can be extremely predatory... 

But in the view of Peloton, no one is buying a $2500 bike not knowing that it costs $40 a month to use it, and odds are with their subscription model they barely need to sell more equipment to continue making rev which is awesome for investors!"

2021-05-05 16:26:35,wallstreetbets,"The recall is weird. On one hand they say you definitely shouldn't use the treadmill on the other hand one of the remedies is they will come and move it to another room so it's not near children. So basically it can be used just keep it away from kids and pets..soooo follow the guidelines they have been giving since the beginning?? 

I don't have a Peloton but I use my treadmill a ton if I were in a similar situation I probably wouldn't return it. Ultimately the treadmill is just as safe as it was before. If you were following the safety guidelines before there's really no reason to return it. And if you do return it you'll be without a treadmill for some period of time. I'd pass. And I think a lot of people will. I'm more interested in a fix. Either peloton providing one or I'd just diy something to block the rear rollers.

Also I think they will come up with a physical fix and resell the treadmills as refurbished. Which reduces the losses some while expanding the market. It's no doubt a financial hit for sure but they will be okay."
2021-05-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I am bullish on Biontech BNTX Hey guys, this is my first serious DD here.

1. Fundamentals

Biontech has 238 Million Shares available. The price is around \~190$ right now.

 Which means the market cap right now is 45Billion $

Ownership:

50% belong to Andreas and Thomas Strüngemann under AT Impf, they were early investors since 2008.

22% is Inside-Ownership like the Owner Ugur Sahin who holds 16%

11% is institutional ownership.

So 83% of the total float is pretty much locked up.

&#x200B;

Revenue and Winnings. 10th of May is their next quarterly call.

So as many of you know Biontech produces the covid vaccine which Pfizer distributes in the US. Pfizer and Biontech share the winnings.

In 2021 Biontech will gross around 20 billion$ in Sales.  80% of that will be winnings.

So around 35% of the market cap right now are winnings of 2021.

But this isnt just it. 

Biontech is the first company who will get admission for people under the age of 16.

Biontech is about to anounce a deal with China to sell them around 100M to 500M doses by july.

The vaccine will last around 6-9 months, then you will need another shot. Because antibodies will be too low. Biontech produces mRNA, which is far better than adona-shots like Johnson & Johnson or Astra-Zeneca-

&#x200B;

Biontech will be able to produce around 3 Billion doses a year. They can make around 10$ Profit for each dose. We dont know if we need another shot in 2023 and forward, but it seems possible.

&#x200B;

But this is just the beginning, the true reason of biontech was to find a cure with mRNA against cancer.

Now they have around 10B $ in cash for research and 14 clinical trials running.

You wanna imagine how much money they will make with the cancer industry?

At least 10M people a year get diagnoses with cancer. 

This is how much a cancer patient costs (a raw show from 2010)

[https://costprojections.cancer.gov/annual.costs.html](https://costprojections.cancer.gov/annual.costs.html)

Lets just be very conservative and say they make 4000$ profit for every patient and have just 20% market share at 10M patients. That would be 8 billion a year of profits scaling up over time as the population gets older. 

And this is very conservative.

&#x200B;

Plus we dont know what else they can do with the mRNA technologie.

&#x200B;

So, if they find a cure against cancer with mRNA with 10B$ a year in profit, that should be worth 200B$ Market cap. Plus they will problably make 40-50B $ with covid vaccines. 

Their longterm market cap should be around 200B$ -250B $ and this doesnt account their very good reputation and first mover advantage in a new powerful science technologie with lots of room for new discoveries.

Which should put their longterm stock price from 190$ current to around 1000$ by 2024-2025 at least.

&#x200B;

So, I am buying shares since a long time plus buying longterm call options, which went up nicely already.

&#x200B;

Looking forward for feedback, thank you for your time

TLDR BNTX, I like the stock

\*this is not financial advice, I am literally a retard\*


Edith 1: There is still a high risk of escape-mutations, in that case the world would need more vaccines in the future. Even if by mid-end 2022 the whole world is getting vaccinated and corono is over, there is still a chance it goes back to animals, mutates and comes back here.

Also biontech has the best reputation worldwide of all vaccines. The CEO Ugur Sahin seems to be very competent. They will and are getting the best researchers worldwide.

And even if you believe it wont go higher, it would still be a good hedge in your portfolio, if the corona-virus finds another escape-mutation that threatens the world economy"
2021-05-05 11:52:26,wallstreetbets,"Defo good stock, got in some months ago at 140. But it has been on a crazy bull run recently, wouldnt buy in now. 1000 PT is just daydreaming.

I was with you up until this point. If the entire crux of your thesis to justify the valuation relies on them finding a cure to cancer it’s garbage. You could apply this same argument to just about every biotech company, and give them a ridiculous valuation. Yes, if they found a cure for cancer. But, they won’t. Cancer is far too complicated to just “use mRNA” to get rid of it."

As of June�30, 2019, we had accumulated losses of #$%$336.5�million.?So they have to make money in order to run their business build since 2008. Now this is their chance and they can not loose what they build since last 13 years. Ugur Sahin already rejected on giving up patent.

I am bullish on this."

2021-05-05 17:56:16,wallstreetbets,"testthe last two days is hard, the prise went down so sharp"
2021-05-05 19:02:42,wallstreetbets,Guess you were right with the patents. Congratz
2021-05-05 12:15:26,wallstreetbets,"Ah, finally a good argument, so we can have a discussion.

The 1000P evaluation comes into effect, if they have a working cancer vaccine. Without 200P right now is a fair price.

&#x200B;

Even though I understand your argument, that they will lift the vaccine patents, there is no way this will actually happen. Let me tell you why.

mRNA vaccines are very complex in production, if companies with low production standarts would start and ruin the product, people might die. If this happens the overall vaccination could stop worldwide. That would cause such harm to the economy, that it isnt worth it. One vaccine has a gdp value of 1000$ for each citiizen, they seell for around 20-30$ a dose, not a rip-off.

&#x200B;

Also, we dont know yet, if we need new vaccines, if the virus mutates and finds escape-mutations. By taking the patents away, you take away future incentives for research companies.

&#x200B;

Also, lets say by the end of 2022 the world was getting vaccinated. Best Case-scenario. The virus could go back into nature, mutate and come back stronger.

&#x200B;

And right now research says that antigenes go away after 6-9 months so you need a booster vaccine. In that case they can still sell a lot after 2022.

&#x200B;

Of course they had a huge bullrun already, but even if you just buy it like 10% of your portfolio, it would still be a great hedge in your portfolio in case another escape-mutation comes into light. And because of that risk+high production standarts needed, I dont see any reason why a government should lift patents, rather than foolish populism which could endanger world economy"
2021-05-05 14:33:54,wallstreetbets,"No, I bought options while the price was around 120$ and sold half of it for 250-400% two days ago at the peak when the price was around 210.
The Rest has long expiry and is up too.
I started buying around 97-170$.
Im up good and happy for corrections. 
I aint bagholding.
I just like the stock und it feels like the Amazon, Facebook or Microsoft of my generation"
2021-05-05 14:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Fair point. I get you, sounds ridiculous. 
But it isnt the entire crux for the whole valuation, just a part. 
Just the corona path alone has room for growth.

mRNA is way to new to speculate on further success. 
Theyre researching on a lot of other stuff as well.
Last year march no one was guessing that biontech would be the first in the world to find a vaccine against Corona with mRNA. 

They now have so much brainpower and money plus 13 years of existance, patents and research. There is no way im making a bet against them"
2021-05-05 19:26:09,wallstreetbets,Zero chance they cancer. Possible to get an indication to support a few specific cancer types. Cancer vaccines don’t cure cancer. They try to improve efficacy of existing immunotherapies in very specific cancer types
2021-05-05 11:54:31,wallstreetbets,"Their last results were good, two weeks ago.
Plus they will have more than 10B $ in Cash for research"

2021-05-05 18:04:37,wallstreetbets,"❤ I love you man. I was just sitting at home loosing faith in humanity.
The next days are just gonna be a bloodbath though. I expect it to drop hard. And just did the math how much I will loose.

The thing is, I wont sell. Even if I have to hold the next 10 years to get breakeven again.

What pisses me off the most is the following: USA never exported any vaccine until their People got everything first. Biontech is a german Company though, Ugur Sahin gave away his life for this.
The EU did send vaccines to the EU while USA stopped exports? 
Now that USA is through with vaccination they wanna play the hero?
Fck you Biden.

And again this will just hurt the overall vaccination program, because others cant keep up with the high quality standarts. This isnt like filling up Coca-Cola bottles. 

Anyway I will hodl through the losses that will come the next days bc everyone will short the fck out of this.

Also, the Crash yesterday, I bet some People had inside knowledge on this announcement today"

After every bullrun is a correction with a new Floor.
I guess it could Go down now to 120-150 before another outbreak.
So I wouldnt say price went down sharply it was just a natural correction 

Get used to swings, Especially biontech is more swingy than you would expect."

2021-05-05 14:10:48,wallstreetbets,"Look I get it. They have cash, and they have brainpower. They’re going to do well. I just don’t think they’ll hit anywhere close to the numbers you’re projecting. I think it’s currently overvalued now. mRNA is really promising, and has a lot of applications. But, they’re not the only one working on it. Second, you have to take into account that the covid vaccine was produced incredibly quickly because governments let it. Drug trials typically take a very long time, and cost a fortune with no guarantee that it will actually make it to market.

Edit: I also can speculate some of the success of mRNA because I understand the limitations of it."
2021-05-05 18:30:06,wallstreetbets,"Delivery of gene therapies will be the biggest application of this technology in the medium/long term. Pfizer announcing they're going mainly after more mRNA vaccines (separate from BioNTech partnership) while moderna is hiring gene editing people is interesting.

I have no idea who will win the future of mrna therapy and how the IP will shake out. Seems broad enough to have multiple winners and BioNTech and Moderna were faster than everyone else and have a single minded focus on this so I'll continue to bet on them... I also like how BioNTech more than anyone this year has consistently underpromised and overdelivered."
2021-05-05 19:27:45,wallstreetbets,This is exactly what I’m saying.
2021-05-05 13:53:02,wallstreetbets,"I haven’t seen the last two results, but historically the drug class has been really ugly across all companies. Hope they are onto something with these ones though.  If they can get good synergy w a  PD1 in a major indication it could be a game changer"

yes, the vaccines ist hard to make, that is a major reason why Prof. Uğur Şahin dont agree with the lift over the patent. if the mRNA Tech easy to make, then bakc to time, the Bayer will jump into the make the mRNA, but indeed bayer did not jump into, cause it very complicated"

2021-05-05 14:36:27,wallstreetbets,"It’s overvalued, dude. It has run up 65% in the past month alone. No way this stuff isn’t priced in. As I said it’s a solid company. It won’t go back down to $100 a share. 

You say that, but I don’t think we’re on the same page with this. Covid trials were quick because it was an exception to the rule. R&D is expensive as hell. This is also completely ignoring that the science isn’t there yet to develop a cure for cancer. mRNA is really cool tech, but they’re not the only one working on it."
2021-05-05 19:24:39,wallstreetbets,"I follow this stuff pretty closely and could've made a lot of money reading between the lines of AZ press releases before common wisdom caught up to reality if I was more aggressive about investing... also would've gotten out of BNTX/MRNA on Monday (and put some of that into buying ocugen puts... what a scam) because Pfizer going further on announcing mRNA work post-BNTX at earnings was very very predictable. What I guess common wisdom hasn't realized is that Pfizer was a big player in mRNA work before and already got beaten to the punch by Moderna and BioNTech on this.

I don't have much of a preference for MRNA vs BNTX... MRNA seems a bit more aggressive about post covid work in terms of what they disclose publically but I'm sure neither is sitting around and just planning to plug the billions made this year into ongoing cancer/vax work or dividends.

Basically I think there's a lot to be made on mRNA therapies now that safety will be proven a few billion times over provided the IP landscape shakes out more or less alright. Enough future drugs to make everyone competent happy but no clue who has the upper hand now so going with the proven winners who will have billions to spend on mRNA and little other business."

2021-05-05 14:12:29,wallstreetbets,Go look at their balance sheet. And that will tell you how undervalued they are. They should be at least a $60 stock.

2021-05-05 16:24:04,wallstreetbets,"I was just reading the report as you commented. Earnings up 236% YoY. And stock down 13%. Seems to me someone wants people's calls to fail?

Or maybe a hedge fund just plain doesn't like the management team of RKT?"
2021-05-05 16:45:24,wallstreetbets,Lol 😂😂😂😂 thank you for downvote but but but...
2021-05-05 17:46:49,wallstreetbets,"I hope OP's got another 200K lying around to cost avg down, its not a bad stock to own."
2021-05-05 14:36:11,wallstreetbets,What specifically on their balance sheet makes you think their value should be $60?

2021-05-05 14:49:58,wallstreetbets,It crashing is the opposite of real
2021-05-05 12:29:15,wallstreetbets,"At least $COIN is profitable compared to 99% of other tech trash.

Shorting this might be a bad idea. If the next 2 months crypto holds as high as it's now, they are going to have another killer quarter (they did more in Q1'21 than the entire year of 2020). Q2 is likely to crush Q1."

2021-05-05 10:29:37,wallstreetbets,"If I had to guess, they neglected to advise you to Diversify"
2021-05-05 12:38:37,wallstreetbets,Well you aren’t in NEE first off
2021-05-05 10:46:06,wallstreetbets,"It's my opinion that the solar industry is mostly just a subsidy scam.   It isn't economically viable in 90% of locations, and won't be for like 50 years.  The only reason it's gotten so much funding is because how heavily Big Oil funds ""green"" initiatives like solar and wind because they know it won't be a realistic competitor for generations.

Why is big oil the largest donator to green initiatives?  Because they campaign and protest against nuclear and hydro stations, which is the real threat to the oil industry (mostly nuclear).  It should take less than 5 years to build a nuclear reactor/generating station, but it takes 15 because big oil has ensured they're red taped and regulated out of contention.  By the time the facility is completed, it's already obsolete; this is by design.

Basically if you're betting on solar, you aren't betting on it actually being viable, you're betting that they'll get enough tax subsidies to force them into ""profitability"". Not financial advice, bla bla bla, but I think the whole industry is a fucking scam."
2021-05-05 10:29:24,wallstreetbets,Who said?
2021-05-05 10:40:46,wallstreetbets,I bought Sunpower at 25 before it mooned and averaged up at 36 when it dipped. It wasn’t a dip :/

In reality, we won't know until the earnings report today after the market closes.  It will either be great and go up or hover/tank. The stock has a pretty solid P/E ratio, so either it will get some hype like the rest of the market re RKT's trajectory and market share, or it could just keep trucking along."

2021-05-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Be Careful Out There - E*TRADE is SHADY. I've been an E\*TRADE user for close to a decade now, but over the last few months, I've had a few **significant** issues within my account that simply shouldn't be happening. The type of mistakes that would likely throw the average person into a full-blown panic attack, or worse...

&#x200B;

The first ""issue"" was during the $GME uprising. I woke up like the rest of you, except with a **$234,357.55 cash call** on my account. 

&#x200B;

[Cash Call](https://preview.redd.it/mrndbfvwxax61.png?width=874&format=png&auto=webp&s=c62fa1ae8a0f65d77c9f75e490d231fd166e4f25)

You may be thinking, ""you stupid fucking idiot stop playing with margin and that wont happen"", but my account was never even approved for margin lol. I owned **<10 shares** of $GME at the time, and was selling them 1 by 1 as the price travelled through the $300's (sorry). So when I saw that I somehow had unwillingly entered a **short position of 736 SHARES OF $GME AT $22.86**, which my account literally did not have the ability to do, I freaked the fuck out. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vcil9kxoyax61.png?width=1091&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c50088143246cfe6c270f5d6b66380aa8d837d7

I'm still not sure what happened that day, but E\*TRADE admitted it was an ""error"" on their end. Huh, what kind of error results in a massive (and impossible) short position on the biggest stock explosion in decades? There wasn't even an order # attached to the trades...imagine being someone who checks their portfolio weekly or monthly rather than 60 times a day, and seeing this shit pop up, not knowing if you made some terrible mistake and your life was completely ruined?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/li4mkcn61bx61.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cc1c9b50fcd678eb7f9a798cc2fd16bcf218966

Well a few months had passed, but last week I decided I finally wanted to upgrade my account to a margin account to allow me to sell a *PMCC* on a deep ITM $NIO call I owned. I had the cash available for the trade I wanted to make (a few thousand), so this shouldn't have been an issue. But like clockwork, the PMCC I sold for **19 FUCKING DOLLARS IN PREMIUM** resulted in another error. A Fed Call, for... 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nvmte0tk0bx61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=61e561f141eebe3292b7a20f21baa62d7f731b76

**...$21,554.07!** Again, after contacting E\*TRADE and looking up whatever a ""Fed Call"" was, it was deemed to be yet another ""error"" on their end. The only trade I had made when margin was enabled was a profitable one, too. **$8.** No wonder this country has a mental health problem, thanks E\*TRADE.

&#x200B;

[Sure, Jan.](https://preview.redd.it/dkz2l0741bx61.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=b12cfa9084bd7ec6a32332284c9d25e96ce96b93)

Okay, the fed call thing was ridiculous, so the day after I was approved for the margin account, I downgraded my account (after all the trades had settled) so I wouldn't have to deal with this nonsense. I thought that would be the end of it. Until this morning, when I woke up to *\*drumroll please\*,* **over $4,000 in cash missing from my account!** I was the lucky winner of the E\*TRADE lottery, because of all the times I've had to contact support for their ""issues"", I got to pay 1 months salary to a random E\*TRADE employee! 

&#x200B;

[Thank you, have a nice day!](https://preview.redd.it/0bwntrqx2bx61.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=63eb6e29eda6d955e9d733854cfe97a7d4157093)

&#x200B;

As I write this, the cash has since been deposited back into my account, but how is this acceptable? If the average person looks at their retirement account once a month and sees a hundred thousand dollar cash call, or a twenty thousand dollar 'Fed Call', they may not act rationally - that's a lot of fucking money. And they'd have no idea if it was an error or not because you would ASSUME that a multi, multi billion dollar brokerage wouldn't make mistakes like this...or maybe not.

I guess the point of this post is to remind people to **be careful**. Up until recently, this hasn't been an industry where regular people had access to these resources, and it seems like they wish it stayed that way."

2021-05-05 13:22:59,wallstreetbets,"Wow, that's pretty fucked, particularly the erroneous call notices.  

I've had them as my primary broker for over 25 years, and have consolidated everything under their roof (primary checking/savings, two IRAs, brokerage, algo trading account).  Never had any problems and definitely never felt anything was shady. 

I can totally get why your experience would shake your faith in their infrastructure, but that said, they're definitely not a fly-by-night operation that plays fast and loose with things the way Robinhood, or Webull, or any of the other startups would. I do wish they had more prompt customer service, though the handful of times I have had to contact them they've always answered or fixed what I needed.

As for the missing cash, if you downgraded your account back to cash after only one day, then there's no way your prior trade had actually fully settled. In a margin account they float you the proceeds of a sale for the two days before settlement with other assets as collateral, and it's transparent to you, so it may look like you actually have settled. Free riding that float in a cash account by buying and then selling assets before the prior trade has actually T+2 settled is federally illegal and can get your account frozen for 3 months if it happens more than once. It's seems very likely that your sales combined with the account type changing during the settlement period has caused a delay in your money being added to your balance.

There's plenty of legit reasons to love or hate a broker, but I don't believe E\*Trade's a scam organization trying to screw over the little guy. IMO they're in the top dozen or so brokers as far as stability and integrity go."

2021-05-05 11:50:36,wallstreetbets,"> so the day after I was approved for the margin account, I downgraded my account (after all the trades had settled) so I wouldn't have to deal with this nonsense.

If you voided the hypothecation agreement by downgrading your account you can't enter short positions because the sheet of paper that said you'd provide cash and marginable securities as collateral in order to borrow cash and marginable securities is no longer a legally binding thing.

Did you have short positions when you downgraded, and did you downgrade after the T+2 settlement period?  My guess is they withheld the cash value of any short positions while they were open or before T+2 ended.

It's also a Good Faith violation to close a position that was opened with unsettled funds before the funds have settled (misuse of broker borrowing unsettled funds) and that might extend to securities and derivatives that somehow wind up in a cash account.

The whole downgrading the account shortly after opening short positions opens up a can of worms."

When I say that makes no sense in my order I see the the fee and if I buy 1000 dollars worth of stock( just using easy numbers) my order will be 1006.99 that I pay so why are they factoring in this money into what my total is.

Unfortunately it's 75 bucks to transfer the stocks out and I have a few so if anyone has any suggestions on a broker that is OTC friendly that doesn't do this type of thing I would appreciate the recommendation. I want to start moving away from them one or 2 stocks at a time."

2021-05-05 13:17:18,wallstreetbets,"Well, I've had etrade for over a decade as well, and never had a real issue. Waiting an hour on hold is pretty sucky tho."
2021-05-05 13:18:01,wallstreetbets,Im just a retarded Schwab guy...
2021-05-05 13:18:12,wallstreetbets,"Welcome to free trades.   In order to recoup, E*trade is doing all kinds of shady shit.  For instance, they hide ongoing short interest rates.  And they charge short interest in nonsensical ways.  If you sell short/buy to cover the same stock 10 times in one day, they will charge you 10x the daily borrow rate, even though they only have to borrow it once.  They also create margin calls by drastically and erratically changing margin requirements from, e.g., from 15% to 40% and back, 50 times in a year, even for for stocks in the S&P500."
2021-05-05 13:19:47,wallstreetbets,"File 3 lawsuits against E*TRADE. You will get a huge compensation and even press charges towards the location in which the transaction was made and then the computer it was made from. IRS is known for their cyber intelligence.. I, personally, would have hired a lawyer to file the lawsuit for me. 
If you would like to take this into consideration, take pictures of everything, EVERYTHING. Apps like these will make it vanish into thin air. Don’t contact them or reply to them until you take the representative or CEO to court. 
Judging on how much was at stake, E*TRADE will most likely want to give you an upfront payment to act like nothing happened (it’s legal but if you have time going through with the lawsuit will definitely benefit you more)."
2021-05-05 13:24:56,wallstreetbets,"Transfer your account somewhere else.

I bet the brokerage would be happy to cover any ACAT fees if you tell them your story.  A loyal customer is worth a lot more than a hundred bucks or whatever."
2021-05-05 13:26:42,wallstreetbets,E*trade is a casino. House always wins.
2021-05-05 13:30:27,wallstreetbets,"Incredibly sketchy stuff here. Good on you that it's well documents and laid out well.

Undeniable on their part, and I would expect this type of fuckery to happen again once the squeeze starts."

2021-05-05 13:34:09,wallstreetbets,"So, which is the best platform now?"
2021-05-05 13:37:13,wallstreetbets,"That's pretty concerning.  I had some similar issues with Webull, and Robinhood shitcorn (unsurprisingly).  I wouldn't have expected stuff like this from E\*Trade."
2021-05-05 13:42:01,wallstreetbets,I like the SoFi app and the fact that you can (soon) buy pre-market IPOs.  But you can’t buy on margin or short... if you’re into that sort of thing.
2021-05-05 13:43:50,wallstreetbets,This strikes me as actual news. People really need to have a repository for this kind of stuff so the brokerages actually bother to fix things
2021-05-05 13:47:06,wallstreetbets,Yea I would tell em so long and thanks for all the fish
2021-05-05 13:53:13,wallstreetbets,That's what you get for paperhanding and I have no sympathy to spare
2021-05-05 13:55:02,wallstreetbets,"E-Trade and Robinhood are both sus, soon much no!"
2021-05-05 13:59:42,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, left them in like 2017."
2021-05-05 14:00:50,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I'm a newb, but on etrade Ive noticed my limit sells get filled at fractions of a cent lower than the limit I enter. 

Sell at 100 @2.05. At execution I see got 204.98 in my account from the sale. Is this normal?"
2021-05-05 14:03:07,wallstreetbets,Those are some fuck up shits. They need to held accountable for and reimburse you with free stocks or free cash. It is like some fuck up hacker tried to fuck with your account and see how you react.
2021-05-05 14:10:16,wallstreetbets,Ive had similar problems with Schwab for months. Switched brokers. All good now.
2021-05-05 14:16:14,wallstreetbets,sounds like you need fidelity or vanguard
2021-05-05 14:19:57,wallstreetbets,"Oh hey.. other people have experience the shadyness that is E-Trade. I had the exact issue of being margin called on my eTrade back in January when GME took off and then quickly dropped. I'm in a CASH account only, no margins, etc.. and they were generous enough (they told me they did me a favor) of extending me margin when I put in a market order for the next day and didn't have the funds to cover it. They cash called me and made me lose 50% of my investment... I quickly moved to Fidelity, but this sounds illegal af."
2021-05-05 14:20:02,wallstreetbets,Etrade show selling me shares of GME in the 600's idk why. Says wash sale next to them
2021-05-05 14:21:51,wallstreetbets,Switch to Schwab!
2021-05-05 14:40:02,wallstreetbets,"probably they are using customer accounts to do illegal activities in the background.  maybe try digging deeper to see which HF owns E*Trade.

P.s. that's why I stick with big banks to trade (TD). might be higher in trade commissions but less likely to have these situations. well everyone have to make money."
2021-05-05 14:45:01,wallstreetbets,Looks like theyre masking the hedgies debts by flicking pseudos onto customers lmao
2021-05-05 14:48:45,wallstreetbets,Yeah I just tried to login to mine to check my portfolio (one of my many secondary trading accounts) and it said my username and password weren’t valid and that I needed to call E*TRADE. What the fuck are they trying to pull over there??
2021-05-05 15:02:43,wallstreetbets,"This is not limited to margin.  I have reached out to Etrade multiple times regarding cost basis information where they have it incorrect and refuse to fix it.  Etrade does allow via UI the ability to fix it yourself but it only stays for 24 hours before reverting to the incorrect info; I have repro'd this across multiple accounts in two different account holders names.  This is tied specifically to preferred shares (i know, boomer style) and Etrade tries to tell me the div paid is a return of capital which is bullshit considering these are preferred shares and this is incredibly rare."
2021-05-05 15:10:27,wallstreetbets,Call mind med      youll feel allright in an hour!
2021-05-05 15:15:40,wallstreetbets,..... \*quickly ducks into fidelity to check account\* oooh a tilray question...
2021-05-05 15:17:18,wallstreetbets,"Get with the times, grandpa. Ever heard of Robinhood?"
2021-05-05 15:20:03,wallstreetbets,I have had similar issues. I think they are not any better than robinhood and my trades tend to go through much better in etrade. I have been contemplating moving that acct to td but only trade options and so have lots of calendar diagonals I don’t want to close but I don’t think you can transfer in kind options contracts so just going to slowly close positions and move cash to td to build up that acct. Thanks for this post. The nudge I needed.
2021-05-05 15:32:12,wallstreetbets,"I had a bad experience with ETRADE as well. Aurora stock did a reverse split or something and I somehow was NEGATIVE shares on my cash funded ira. I wasn't really sure what happened because the etrade account was just a trash ira I had funded years ago and basically forgot about and moved on to a different ira with TDA. (yeah I know I probably could have managed that better)

The rep on the phone was pretty nice and he reversed a fee I had but the resulting situation was that I lost 80% of the initial value of that account. And I'm still not entirely sure what happened. I walked away from that conversation thinking I'm not putting another dollar in that account. As far as I know I didn't get any email or call, they were happy to keep sticking fees on my account."
2021-05-05 15:49:30,wallstreetbets,"Aside from leaving these guys asap, I would report them to FINRA and the SEC.  I believe you will leave feeling satisfied that they will get a whole lot more aggravation than you received.  I have a back office background.  This sounds like a lot of very messy accounting going on.  Your problems are likely just the tip of the iceberg."
2021-05-05 15:49:45,wallstreetbets,"Crazy today my account was up 2,000 on peleton call options I’m like how sway, treadmill recall, class action and my options went up naw. Sure enough it wouldn’t let me close those calls out for nothing and now my account is back flat"
2021-05-05 15:51:15,wallstreetbets,My company provides me with mine. They may want to know about this
2021-05-05 16:03:12,wallstreetbets,"I just checked my etrade account. Holy shit. These motherfuckers are fucking crooks. I just have a few penny stocks. I don't even know what's going on, but one of the companies shows 1 share of stock. They have charged me 3 times for a reorganization fee of $38. If I try to sell that 1 stock that is worth a penny, etrade wants $6.95 to sell it. I'm closing my account right now. How in the fuck is etrade still in business?

And, to be clear, I had several thousand of them. Apparently etrade is selling them or something. I have no idea. I got so mad I had to hang up the phone. I'm shaking right now. It's only a few bucks, less than a share of GME, but it's the principle."
2021-05-05 16:06:25,wallstreetbets,"I love how quickly a single instance of this with etrade puts them on blast, yet 95% of wsb users still use robinhood despite them *criminally* fucking over their entire clientbase for a hedge fund they had actual ties with.  And noone from RH is in jail yet? Crazy world."
2021-05-05 16:09:54,wallstreetbets,"Will admit that I kinda skimmed this due to the ""first issue"". So, actually I had a similar cash call/imbalance show up on my SCHWAB account, was late/AH on a weeknight. Happened one time. I called Schwab immediately, they got a higher level person to look into it and they called me back at about 9:30 PM EST. I logged back in, it was fixed. I think all the actual brokers (um, not talking about Robinhood here folks, they are a ""special"" problem class) have several integrations/transfers and other 'backend' processes, batch jobs, backups, etc. that have to run at some time (8 PM being better than 10 AM), plus I'm sure they have to run upgrades, patches, maintenance. It's all done by humans of course, with 'less than perfect' software. Something, somewhere, always gets f-cked up. Call your e-trade support, make screen shots, documents, etc. And make sure it gets fixed. If they don't fix it immediately and it's stressing you, just try to breathe, know you can prove it, and give them a couple hours. The tech it moving damn fast, we all want perfection, it ain't ready yet. *I'm not standing up for e-trade, I don't work for a broker, I will never invest in any broker.* I have to use their interface to manage a family members' portfolio and *I think it's crap. They all could do much better, but they're NOT going to try to make you responsible and generally, they respond in a reasonable timeframe. Good luck.*"
2021-05-05 16:13:17,wallstreetbets,"I tried buying AGNMF yesterday. Etrade spread on that stock? .66 cents a share. On a equity at was trading at $.44. I didn't mind the $6 transaction fee but what is essentially a 150% spread? gtfo of here Etrade.

&#x200B;

Averaged down more PLTR instead."
2021-05-05 16:14:09,wallstreetbets,"E-Trade got bought out by Morgan Stanley (last year I think) as well, which probably doesn't help anything.  If anything Morgan will try to cut costs and ""achieve synergies""; and their customer service will go to shit."
2021-05-05 16:14:55,wallstreetbets,Yikes 😬
2021-05-05 16:20:02,wallstreetbets,"My cost per share was wrong after my transfer! from Robinhood xx@202$ to TDA with xxx@176$. I now have a cost per share of 109$ as much as I like my green % I don’t understand how this can happen. Talked to TDA who said the problem is on Robinhoods part, “it’s been ongoing for months”. Makes you wonder how many of their “target customer” aka NEW INVESTORS won’t catch this and end up loosing money pulling out at “0%” gains or paying unnecessary taxes! I haven’t seen any other posts regarding it please make people aware to check their numbers!"
2021-05-05 16:29:18,wallstreetbets,"They changed rules like a year ago I think, so if you have an older account, you automatically have a margin account. Happened to me as well. the only downside to not having a margin is that you wont be able to short."
2021-05-05 16:30:02,wallstreetbets,Fidelity. That is not acceptable treatment. An error can happen sure. 3 like that ?  ✌️
2021-05-05 16:41:50,wallstreetbets,"Never had a problem with E*TRADE. Been using them for 3 yrs, even during the GME 
and AMC boom"
2021-05-05 16:45:56,wallstreetbets,"Had my share of issues with them. The conclusion I am coming to is that they’re all “shady,” to some extent. Lets be real, they’re banks. Now that thats out of the way, there can only be a certain level of “trust,” when it comes to the criminals running financial institutions and that isnt much. Considered leaving ET. Got in when they bought options house. I was with them and just got thrown into ET. We shall see what the future holds. For now im just staying put but I may switch someday. Thanks for that personal account. Very important data to consider. -OM-"
2021-05-05 16:50:42,wallstreetbets,"First thing in morning my friend does is check her accts to make sure all looks good. 1 time she caught 2 Facebook charges of 600 each and had to call bank right away. 

Is good idea to check ur acct daily so ur shares don’t disappear"
2021-05-05 16:55:27,wallstreetbets,"As a retired mgr of an office I can maybe see a trade booked into a wrong acct with the volume and trading in GME but there would be someone on the other side of your trade, but the Fed call and especially the $4000 not there is beyond acceptable.  Obviously their back office is staffed with anyone with a pulse but market knowledge is not necessary.  I would say to contact a supervisor who manages the back office but really you’ll get the standard “we’re sorry, this is being corrected so it won’t happen again and 100 free trades, but the commission is so low it’s not worth the effort.  Move your acct to Ameritrade or anyone you are comfortable with."
2021-05-05 16:57:45,wallstreetbets,"Deposited a $1200 check into my Bofa account and woke up with a -2400 balance lol.  Check bounced and they removed the 1200 twice, sick."
2021-05-05 17:03:05,wallstreetbets,Yeap. ETrade is garbage company
2021-05-05 17:07:48,wallstreetbets,Is e-bull part of e-trade? I opened an account with them to buy dogecoin but didn’t make a deposit yet.
2021-05-05 17:12:12,wallstreetbets,Sounds like possible liquidity problems.
2021-05-05 17:21:15,wallstreetbets,"Robin Hood rules,they don’t pull shit like this"
2021-05-05 17:35:43,wallstreetbets,Etrade is actually a great brokerage.   You can actually call them and talk to somebody to sort out anything within 5 minutes.
2021-05-05 17:37:32,wallstreetbets,that sounds hella fucky
2021-05-05 17:47:48,wallstreetbets,Probably forgot to carry the y .
2021-05-05 17:50:05,wallstreetbets,Hurry up and leave them fools
2021-05-05 17:56:20,wallstreetbets,"Have had similar experiences. They purchased a contract with margin instead of the cash that was in my account. I tried for almost 2 weeks and every avenue to get a hold of support with no luck. I decided to just close out the contract to be safe. Then they finally contacted me back to say ""you don't have a contract under margin"", yeah no shit not anymore cause I got rid of it.

Anyway a week later GME blew up and the call was worth 40k

2021-05-05 18:01:13,wallstreetbets,"I'm on eTrade, and while I haven't seen anything this wild, their website has been shit a bunch of times in the last couple weeks. The ticker search returns no results, and if I load a ticker from my portfolio, all the number fields come up as 0s. The color scheme of the interface changed within the last week, so I've assumed they are updating their systems on the back end and have had problems (I'm a tech engineer, so I get it). But I am concerned that there's going to be fuckery in the form of ""technical problems"" when the MOASS comes."
2021-05-05 18:08:32,wallstreetbets,"I've gotten fucked so many times on etrade.

1. Wrong options contract shows up (wrong expiration)
2. Market execution on options when i could swear i put limits on them.
3. Couldn't pull out of an option expiring same or next day due to technical issue on etrade's end. It worked out as i made money but it stressed me out pretty bad.

There's so much about etrade that just sucks balls. Why am i still on it? It allows me to sell naked calls like a fuckin retard."

2021-05-05 19:55:39,wallstreetbets,"I used to work for a company like E\*trade. I did not work with trade approvals. But I will tell you many processes have a level of semi-manual checks. A human has to do a workflow to approve or deny certain trades. This looks like human error. It's really, really aggravating, but I doubt it was intentional. Sounds like they need to spend some money on automation, training, and increasing staffing. You know like every greedy financial services company and bank out there."

2021-05-05 13:07:02,wallstreetbets,Never gonna forget that name. I know who he is without looking at a link. Has that suit gone through court yet?
2021-05-05 13:28:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’m thinking your right on the conversion from margin-cash and then holding the funds from the proceeds, just seemed strange since there was no way of tracking where the money actually was, as it wasn’t reflected in any of my balances, just an unlabeled outgoing transfer."
2021-05-05 11:52:09,wallstreetbets,Exactly. I use fidelity to give my brain some wrinkles and then I use wallstreetbets to sand those wrinkles smooth again. I like balance
2021-05-05 17:04:35,wallstreetbets,"Well while I generally agree, this kind of stuff can happen there too. I sold a few *covered* calls at Fidelity in an account with 10k in it and was given notice that I was in a house call for about 30k. When I contacted them they refused to answer one way or the other even though it was an obvious mistake. They just said ""give it a couple days"" even though the message said i had till EOD to deposit the funds or be liquidated."

2021-05-05 12:43:30,wallstreetbets,I was locked out of buying GME during the cluster if that helps you
2021-05-05 13:40:15,wallstreetbets,"Because they severely limit you in what you can do. Iirc, everyone is blocked from buying inverse and leveraged ETFs on there. Its also much much harder to get options or margin approval. On top of that, Ive had some bad experiences with their customer service where three different representatives were telling me three completely different things in regards to a hold on my account. Theyre optimized for boomer trading; low cost ETFs and an interface that discourages active trading. Great for retirement, not so much WSB style gambling."
2021-05-05 12:33:27,wallstreetbets,">Early ape holder here. I've been using vanguard and have absolutely zero issues with them. They may not be the most trendy platform but I'm surprised I haven't seen more mention of them.

Their beta trading app, Beacon, is better, although could still use some improvements if you haven't seen it."
2021-05-05 13:15:09,wallstreetbets,"The fact I can trade options on the vanguard app is a huge deal breaker for me, as well as limited order types, and no extended hours trades. Like if I have options open, without access to a PC I can't close them"
2021-05-05 16:13:10,wallstreetbets,"only issue I had with vanguard is on important buy the dip fucking days they dont have enough bandwidth to have everyone log in the morning so you miss the dip by like 2 hours happened during covid march low's and also septem/oco 2020 correction, and during the GME they limited buying of GME shares and selling only via limit orders"

2021-05-05 12:06:41,wallstreetbets,"You could be right on that front, that missing $4k could’ve been a result of them holding funds from the PMCC on NIO from the week prior, but I already had the funds available in my account and this was like 4 trading days after I had closed that position. So idk. 

(still doesn’t explain the erroneous cash call/fed call though)"
2021-05-05 13:17:47,wallstreetbets,That is disturbing
2021-05-05 10:45:20,wallstreetbets,Who'd you switch to?
2021-05-05 10:50:10,wallstreetbets,"I suppose you’re right, but they’re bugs that could cost someone thousands if they don’t contact support, which IMO is a little shady"
2021-05-05 17:49:08,wallstreetbets,"As long as they have a team invested in managing ALL of these bugs and every dollar is given back in a timely manner without each client having to contact Etrade.

Personally, during the second ""bug"" I wouldn't even contact Etrade. Straight to a lawyer who would probably be drooling for Etrade not to respond within 30 days."
2021-05-05 16:27:42,wallstreetbets,"I've used E-trade for 8 years now and have never had a problem what so ever.  I think the platforms great and apps easy to use, though most people will complain on here and say otherwise.  Check it out yourself and form your own opinion.  You know how reddit is."
2021-05-05 11:17:00,wallstreetbets,Are you sure? I was able to buy during the freeze.
2021-05-05 11:23:37,wallstreetbets,"Not only GME. I still don’t understand why they limited tsla once. I saved both screenshots.... it has nothing to do with the buying power, etc... I was very surprised nobody ever mentioned Etrade but just RH"
2021-05-05 13:20:07,wallstreetbets,They limited margin trading.  E*TRADE sucks but pls don’t conflate them with the crime of RH.
2021-05-05 13:15:54,wallstreetbets,They were one of the last to do do it of all the brokers tho.
2021-05-05 10:29:35,wallstreetbets,"that wasn’t a trade I actually made lol, that was the E*TRADE error, whatever it was. I sold the share at $260 in the screenshot though."
2021-05-05 10:20:17,wallstreetbets,I use etrade an got mine yesterday. Just call on phone
2021-05-05 12:17:15,wallstreetbets,THANKS OBAMA
2021-05-05 11:46:30,wallstreetbets,"because I owned a handful of shares of GME, that invalidates their incompetency? lol"
2021-05-05 11:38:18,wallstreetbets,"They're just factoring the cost into the cost basis of your shares, so you know when you have actually made money buying those shares. Idk what you're complaining about lol"
2021-05-05 13:47:52,wallstreetbets,"Dude, that's literally \*exactly\* how they're supposed to account for your cost. 

If you bought one share of a company from me for $100 and the broker charged you a $10 fee, then it cost you a total of $110 for that share, and that's your basis for computing capital gains. If it goes up to $150 per share, and you get charged another $10 to sell it, then you've only actually earned $30, not $50 because the $20 in fees reduced your profit.

I mean, if you'd prefer to find a broker that doesn't roll transaction costs into your displayed basis, I'm guessing you can find one but that's not really something I'd recommend you seek out.  It would just make your screen look prettier with bigger gain numbers but then you'd have to work all that back into the cost when you do your taxes anyway."
2021-05-05 12:57:58,wallstreetbets,The biggest issue with option trading is the price delay. I had to open other platform while making a trade. Even the free ones (e.g. yahoo finance ) is doing a better job. I agree it seems got worse starting last year. So it’s the pandemic or ms?
2021-05-05 12:58:47,wallstreetbets,I hate to say so. It’s a pain for me too. But I did start to do it.
2021-05-05 12:53:59,wallstreetbets,i heard it’s good
2021-05-05 10:28:15,wallstreetbets,I mean a person who doesn’t check their portfolio dozens of times a day...

2021-05-05 18:51:51,wallstreetbets,"Did you clowngrade her garbatrage?

Yes, I googled funny stock terms for that sad attempt.."
2021-05-05 13:48:20,wallstreetbets,"I use E*TRADE and think it’s amazing. Never had 1 single problem. I had GME positions, and it got halted a bunch of times and on some crazy shit - but didn’t it get halted everywhere? Or was it just E*TRADE?"
2021-05-05 13:42:16,wallstreetbets,">but ETrade halted trading on GME at one point so fuck you and see ya later

Are you sure about that? I've been using them for 8 years and I was buying GME on them while people on RH and TDAmeritrade were complaining about being halted. I never wasn't able to buy with ETrade. I use them as my brokerage, IRA, checking, and savings and never had any issue so this surprises me."
2021-05-05 13:53:03,wallstreetbets,I would need to see some proof that E\*Trade halted trading on GME.  I was able to buy the day RH shut things down from my E\*TRade acct.
2021-05-05 14:49:00,wallstreetbets,"I've had no problems with ETrade for at least 15 years and if I have any questions or need anything done a quick phone call to my named account rep and it is solved, usually undoing an overfunded retirement plan with a transfer to another year."
2021-05-05 10:58:04,wallstreetbets,"Next time you call they'll blame Morgan Stanley integration team, who'll blame eTrade, who'll forward you to MS."
2021-05-05 10:51:37,wallstreetbets,Etrade sold me 1000 AMC shares at a price above $15 when the highest price that day was something like $10. They did this a few years ago so I cleaned out my checking and stopped using them but started back last year. I might have to move as well now.
2021-05-05 11:24:01,wallstreetbets,"They’re all on margin. Everyone is on margin. Why lose your own money when you can burn through someone else’s. If you owe 10,000 on margin that’s your problem but if you owe 10M that’s their problem..."
2021-05-05 13:16:03,wallstreetbets,Then acat your portfolio to a different broker.
2021-05-05 12:52:53,wallstreetbets,I don't have GME
2021-05-05 11:40:26,wallstreetbets,It's also about 5 mins behind actual prices. Kinda ridiculous.
2021-05-05 15:21:38,wallstreetbets,"I requested a full share transfer of my etrade holdings on Fidelity. I provided my etrade account number, and Fidelity essentially took care of the rest. It took about three working days."
2021-05-05 13:36:53,wallstreetbets,"I agree it's cryptic - it's the downside of them trying to make things too easy to understand and hiding some of the mechanics behind the scenes.  

I ran into it years ago when I was first trading in my IRA. Accidentally triggered the free riding rule, got a slap on the wrist from them saying if I did it again I'd get frozen out of my accounts for 90 days per the SEC reg. Spent a lot of time that weekend reading up on WTF happened. 

Anyway, not trying to be an E\*Trade fanboy or anything - they obviously make mistakes like any other big company. I just put them in a different category of base trustworthiness than something foreign-based like Webull in China where they are only sorta-subject to US law and out of reach of any individual lawsuit.

FWIW, the ""fed call"" thing is also specifically related to free-riding unsettled cash and SEC regulation T, so that notice could actually \*also\* be linked to the cash->margin->cash account changes and not actually a mistake. Not to forgive them exactly, but it may not just be a bug in their system as much as poor communication and a support team that doesn't understand subtle details of the law."
2021-05-05 13:03:57,wallstreetbets,You will eventually run out of brain with that method.
2021-05-05 17:38:13,wallstreetbets,All helps. Replies in this thread I will answer directly.
2021-05-05 16:15:47,wallstreetbets,yep this is true I had margin account one day with vanguard and reverted back because they were already calling my ass and the kicker I didnt even use/borrow money for the trades it was all cash lol. So i was like these people stupid. moved on to other platforms for swings/trading
2021-05-05 12:45:51,wallstreetbets,"I hadn't come across that yet. Thanks for sharing, I know what I'll be doing over the lunch hour!"
2021-05-05 13:08:20,wallstreetbets,"Best hour and 10 mins spent holding for E*TRADE ..
Vote is in and transfer to Fidelity ball rolling.

BYYYEEEEE"
2021-05-05 12:24:58,wallstreetbets,"Mine is that now they are not doing OTC orders. Cause the SEC wants to protect me. But if they are restricting me on this, whats not to say they will restrict AMC selling when the squeeze hits. You can go there. They were a pretty good exchange till that happened. Maybe u will not be restricted. I got restricted from buying HCMC(OTC) and by coincidence they are shorting that stock too. I didnt think they could short OTCs but i guess Hedgies can do what they want."
2021-05-05 11:20:20,wallstreetbets,Schwab
2021-05-05 11:21:09,wallstreetbets,"Most definitely shady. These accounts are made with risk in mind, for the support to just claim I guess it was an error done by ""so and so"". Doesn't make it acceptable let alone happened 3 times to this guy's alone. Nonsense errors for a company fully ran on the internet with pretty much only digital access. BS"
2021-05-05 11:23:37,wallstreetbets,Yikes. I'm withdrawing money out of anchor USD and to test it I sent myself $500 from there. It went perfect. But now that I want to withdraw upwards of 20k its not so automated as it was and I'm just hoping I get my money soon so I can pay bills and not miss opportunities
2021-05-05 12:37:45,wallstreetbets,How long did it take you to get support on the phone ?
2021-05-05 11:21:33,wallstreetbets,And it takes at least an hour to get connected to a customer service member. I’m moving to other app too.
2021-05-05 11:27:43,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know if they restricted or their system was overwhelmed and couldn’t handle the traffic but people did have issues placing orders. Same w TDA. I couldn’t even log in on mobile, desktop or their custom service. Could have sold at 480 but hey could be worse... I’m still holding w a dirt low cost average. They can have my shares for $xx,xxx,xxx."
2021-05-05 11:19:36,wallstreetbets,I am indeed sure they limited the number you can buy. There was a whole post with a list of them and articles cited but I am bad at reddit and this sub has a billion posts on it but its out there...somewhere
2021-05-05 12:23:20,wallstreetbets,"not everyone got hit with it as it persisted for a way shorter time period than other brokers' lockouts, but yeah there were multiple people who reported problems buying for a little bit"
2021-05-05 14:55:42,wallstreetbets,I've had etrade about 12 years now and I was locked out of the memestocks for most of a day during the GME wildness. I received different error messages at each attempted transaction.
2021-05-05 12:36:49,wallstreetbets,"I also screenshot my gme lockout and saved their 
automated message where they were telling everyone calling that you can’t buy certain stocks GME being one.  Meanwhile all my GME sits there amongst other things.. Just opened Fidelity.  If they ever answer the phone. I’m out.  Holding An hour now.  Clown show."
2021-05-05 14:57:03,wallstreetbets,"They did lock out users from certain transactions for most of a day during the GME craziness, I was not able to buy several stocks during normal trading hours on etrade."
2021-05-05 11:31:28,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure that was an error or a glitch. They straight up shorted your shares and the order you saw in your account was the result including other people’s shares. If anything they fucked up in hiding their act. Keep those records!
2021-05-05 10:28:32,wallstreetbets,The trouble is RH has hidden their phone number and the email says it may be days before they address my question. The meeting is in a week. I'm certain it's just more fuckery and Vlad is getting a kickback for only providing the one proxy.
2021-05-05 11:25:34,wallstreetbets,So you had to call to get the materials... but it took at least an hour to wait in the line to be connected
2021-05-05 17:29:46,wallstreetbets,I received the email from E*Trade today. Voted. Done.
2021-05-05 15:20:01,wallstreetbets,"I get that I just idk because it came off the top I wasn't factoring that in at that point in my mind that is a few bulbs dim at times that money was gone so I am not thinking about that at this point so I guess my thought would be for example instead of my average being $50 a share for example it should then be $51 a share if that is what they are doing instead of how they are showing it to me where it doesn't add up. 

Which is fine if that's how they are calculating the cost I guess if your gonna factor that in factor it in all the way then. 

The easy things allude me often"
2021-05-05 13:11:15,wallstreetbets,"Its just a guess but MS. Nothing about the Pandemic has bothered any of the major brokerages I am on (TD, IB, Fidelity, and Schwab). Ally had some issues during heavy volume days but they outsource their backend and it can't keep up.

I use Think or Swim for all my streaming needs regardless of which platform I am using. :)"

2021-05-05 13:50:11,wallstreetbets,same
2021-05-05 16:06:13,wallstreetbets,Not at TD
2021-05-05 13:57:07,wallstreetbets,"Volatility based trading halts aren't broker-specific, they're imposed as circuit-breakers on the exchange itself. GME had been hitting exchange-mandated halts multiple times a day for like a month straight, and that definitely hit everyone.

That's different than what some of the smaller brokers like Robinhood did where they limited the scale or types of trades people could make due to their inability to handle the capital flow to the clearinghouses."
2021-05-05 15:23:14,wallstreetbets,"In the first run up I placed a covered call on weds because it was a smart but somewhat hedged positioned. Woke up and position was up about $10,000. Perfect. Good trade. Take profits and move on...after 90 minutes of putting in market orders and gme allowed to fall I closed my position for $100 profit."
2021-05-05 17:39:05,wallstreetbets,Changing the topic eh?  OP is not talking about GME.  ETRADE’s behavior is leechy and borderline criminal.  Their business model seems to be based on hope that their customers will not notice the error.
2021-05-05 17:50:30,wallstreetbets,It was not everywhere
2021-05-05 13:59:43,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of people are confusing exchange-wide circuit-breaker halts with their broker choosing to stop trading. GME was halted left and right, but I also never saw a point where it was actively trading but ETrade didn't allow my orders."
2021-05-05 13:56:45,wallstreetbets,TD never halted that I was aware of....I was bouncing that GME all day until I closed my position north of 342
2021-05-05 13:53:30,wallstreetbets,"Yes and I [had a conversation with their support](https://imgur.com/gallery/17MUdau) about it. Their only explanation was they shut it down because of ""unprecedented volatility"" but didn't explain if it was a scaling issue, request from DTCC, etc."
2021-05-05 15:26:30,wallstreetbets,"It happened to me. Spent 90 minutes putting in market orders. Limit orders. Limit order below market. Had $10,000 in profit."
2021-05-05 15:33:26,wallstreetbets,Yes the definitely halted buying of GME. Same time as the robinhood crap. I wanted to buy a bunch and they said they wouldn't fill the order with the same excuses as robinhood. Cost me an easy 50k that day in after hours when it shot up. Still pisses me off.
2021-05-05 16:46:11,wallstreetbets,They halted buying of GME for about an hour into the close on one day at the end of January. (I tried to buy and could not and when I called them the guy couldn’t give me an explanation for why it had happened.)
2021-05-05 19:26:25,wallstreetbets,"I have an Etrade account and I can confirm they did indeed shut down buying on GME at one point. I complained loudly and was told ""eh, don't worry about it - we turned it back on"". But yes, there was at least a day - and I think a few - where you couldn't buy GME on Etrade."
2021-05-05 14:03:08,wallstreetbets,Does this work? [https://imgur.com/gallery/17MUdau](https://imgur.com/gallery/17MUdau)
2021-05-05 11:40:20,wallstreetbets,Same situation happened with me. WhenI confronted withthem they did not accept their mistake and I am the one who ended up withthe losses.
2021-05-05 11:52:40,wallstreetbets,"My AMC purchase was the same... Trading around $9.50 and my basis price is $16/share. I contacted them and got stonewalled. I've been too lazy to move my account, also not sure other platforms are superior. I'm waiting for the class action suit."
2021-05-05 11:27:37,wallstreetbets,All my shares on Webull and E*TRADE are on confirmed cash accounts.
2021-05-05 12:08:02,wallstreetbets,"I believe you can chose to get real time quotes through Fidelity. But you have to sign up for them, at least I did. 
Then again I guess I'm not sure if you mean their ""real-time quote"" is still slow by 5 minutes."
2021-05-05 12:14:34,wallstreetbets,"You can activate real-time on Fidelity. I trade some foreign OTC stocks that only update once every 15 minutes on yahoo or google, so it became a necessity for me."

2021-05-05 13:50:54,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-05 13:02:52,wallstreetbets,Apart from the pretty bad UI Schwab is great. I never thought I'd use their fancy research but it has turned out to be pretty useful.

2021-05-05 15:25:06,wallstreetbets,"It was not halted when I put in trades, order flow just blocked. Td had no problem from what I understand."
2021-05-05 14:04:51,wallstreetbets,I know what a circuit breaker halt is. [ETrade halted trading](https://imgur.com/gallery/17MUdau) on their own for a brief period.
2021-05-05 14:08:40,wallstreetbets,This sucks.  I have been with E\*Trade for a long time and have had very few issues with them.  But this makes me consider leaving for another bank.
2021-05-05 11:59:05,wallstreetbets,Did you guys sell AMC at a loss and try to buy back in when this happened?  If so its considered a wash sale and that's why you were charged more for those shares.  Same thing happened to my co worker.
2021-05-05 12:13:29,wallstreetbets,Wash sale most likely. I thought the same thing. Log on to computer interface and in cool the wash sale button. It will be accurate
2021-05-05 13:57:38,wallstreetbets,How do I tell what my E*TRADE account is. I only wire money into the account and make my transactions.
2021-05-05 12:10:56,wallstreetbets,Active trader pro is awesome if you are a desktop degen
2021-05-05 12:45:13,wallstreetbets,"Is that only through desktop or web browser trader too?

Real-time quotes are insanely important IMO.  Also curious if it costs money and how much."
2021-05-05 13:46:54,wallstreetbets,"I'm on mobile, so maybe that's the difference but if I click on a stock, it won't show the real time price all the way up until I actually confirm a trade. So i have to watch Yahoo finance and make trades in fidelity app at the same time."
2021-05-05 15:51:02,wallstreetbets,"I'll preface this by saying my entire portfolio is in GME. Fidelity proved themselves to be trustworthy when Robinhood and others (E-trade included) halted trading back in late January. 

I've been on the fence about switching to Fidelity and finally made the move when they announced their app was being upgraded in a few weeks. They won me over as a customer by listening to their users. I can't speak for the desktop experience as I'm simply a mobile user on a cash account"
2021-05-05 19:34:34,wallstreetbets,She had double barrel quant-titties
2021-05-05 15:57:20,wallstreetbets,"yeah, certainly could be - someone put a screenshot under a different comment that showed a chat admitting a legit stoppage by ETrade.  

That said, the entire market was a massive shit show for a couple days there, hence the congressional hearings. Any broker that made it through cleanly with no hiccups is a true rarity."
2021-05-05 16:34:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah etrade wouldn't let you buy gme
2021-05-05 14:13:52,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough - I hadn't actually seen evidence of that, but I definitely \*had\* seen a LOT of inexperienced people conflating the two and getting very upset at any number of brokers over it. Particularly on those days where trading would be halted 15 minutes, reopen for 30 seconds and halt again for 15 minutes, over and over for the whole afternoon.

Out of curiosity, do you know how long that halt lasted? I hadn't had any issues buying in at various points during that time, but perhaps I was just lucky to hit right before or after they halted."
2021-05-05 14:11:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah same. I suspect they had little choice in the matter (who knows under what parameters they were working from) but given that Fidelity *never* restricted trading and they have much more accessible customer service I decided to switch.
2021-05-05 12:16:54,wallstreetbets,"yeah, and it's not that they were charged more for the shares, it's just that the cost basis is higher due to the wash sale. The losses are essentially added to the base cost of the repurchased shares."

2021-05-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Inflation, Commodities Supercycles & Broken Supply Chains: Why macroeconomic conditions have aligned to make $CLF America’s number 1 steel company (and perhaps trigger a short squeeze in the process!) Not Financial Advice Disclosure: I am an idiot. I have negative net worth due to student loans. I couldn’t tie my own shoes until I was 8 years old. If you are taking financial advice from me, you’re in deep shit. That said…

Hi everybody! Cleveland-Cliffs (Ticker: CLF) is an American steel company and in this post I will explain why I made it my biggest position since the MVIS short squeeze.  In short, $CLF is a vertically integrated steel company:  It mines ore (the largest ore producer in the country!) and turns that ore into steel and sells that steel. Steel is used to make a gazillion different products, from cars to forks to buildings. 

Now that a supply chain crunch has hit, steel prices are skyrocketing literally everyday. It closed at $20.36 yesterday. The stock has significant short interest - Ortex reported 11.26% a few days ago. These shorts are probably screwed soon, because CLF is a great long-term hold & the market is waking up to it. 

CAVEAT: I was hoping to have a few more days to write this post, but $CLF started ripping upwards yesterday. The media began reporting more heavily on steel prices and commodities super cycles over the last week, perhaps because steel prices have gotten too obscene or because Warren Buffett mentioning steel this weekend. So I am rushing my writing of this a bit, because I want to get this out while I believe the getting is still real good.  I will try to hit the main points, both bull and bear. 

### OK OK gimme the juice: Why did $CLF break upwards yesterday?

# 🚀🚀🚀 Macroeconomic conditions have aligned for CLF to become the top steel company in the USA for decades to come. 
### **1. Inflation 🍌**

Have you heard about how [the price of the stuff that makes everything is surging](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/the-price-of-the-stuff-that-makes-everything-is-surging?srnd=premium)? Inflation is in full effect.  Michael Burry, one of the few guys who called 2008 right (and was played by Christian Bale in The Big Short) warned about hyperinflation months ago (Here’s one of the top DD posts all-time on WSB about this: [Why Father Burry is calling the big short 2.0 - I have translated his message into a language you autists may, with effort, be able to understand. Three words: Inflation.](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr8h1v/why_father_burry_is_calling_the_big_short_20_i/)).  Burry actually got visited by the SEC after warning about hyperinflation and deleted his Twitter account. 👀

Many factors are driving this inflation. One of those factors (it’s a feedback loop, really…) is that steel prices are surging: **[US Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel Futures Contracts](https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-steel-coil-contracts) 🍌 CLF is (as of 2020!) the largest producer of hot-rolled steel in America and stands ready to benefit from this inflation. 

### **2. American supply chains are fucked. 🕳**

As a result of tax incentives, lax enforcement, and “free trade” agreements, American industrial/manufacturing capacity has been devastated over the last 40 years (politicians love to talk about how “jobs have been shipped overseas”, but not fix it).  Well, the chickens came home to roost during Covid-19, which I would argue accelerated many timelines, including a supply chain crunch. America is being forced to come to grips with the importance of being able to produce essential goods internally. Steel is a pillar of the economy. President Trump supported the industry with tariffs, and President Biden has continued them.

### **3.  China has stopped dumping steel on the market. China is now competing for scrap metal. Both of these things make the price of steel rise. 🇨🇳📈**

For years, the Chinese government supported steel production as a jobs program for its citizens.  This resulted in China having way too much steel, so they dump it into the international market at a discount. This drives the price of steel lower. 

China’s methods of steel production have  been an unmitigated environmental disaster. But it’s 2021, baby! China is now committed to cleaning things up & is revamping how it makes steel. This has multiple implications that affect the international steel market. 

First, China is making less steel 👉 They’re no longer dumping it into the international market, which _was_ driving prices down.  So now steel prices are going boom boom.  💸

Second, China is using a different steel-making process, one that is more reliant on scrap metal.  That means China is now buying up scrap metal. China is great at getting its hands on raw materials — it’s government generally acts more quickly to developing macroeconomic conditions than the American government.   They have been buying up commodities for years. [Bloomberg: China’s Commodities Binge Makes America’s Future More Expensive](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/u-s-infrastructure-plan-faces-problem-china-s-commodities-copper-binge)

There is a very good video of the CLF CEO talking about all this called “China, The Environment, and the Next Decade” that you can find, but I can’t post here due to automod. :)

### **4. A Squeeze is beginning in the American scrap metal market. ⛓**

[Nearly 70% of the Steel used in the US is recycled from scrap. Steel used in construction has a 90% recycling Rate.](https://www.bir.org/publications/facts-figures/download/643/175/36?method=view).  

As explained, scrap prices are soaring. This is going to eat into those scrap-dependent steel companies’ bottom lines (Nucor, US Steel) . 

### **5. CLF is not reliant on scrap. CLF will have higher profit margins. 🚀**

CLF mines its own ore. It does not need to buy scrap to make steel. In fact, it can sell steel iron ore to other companies if it chooses.  

This means CLF is going to have increasingly large product margins from the insane steel prices.  

### 6. **CLF is gonna be able to deliver product - essential to American infrastructure. America needs steel during the current commodities supercycle & it will turn to Cleveland-Cliffs. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸**

CLF is American as fuck. Its roots go all the way back to 1847, and it was founded by a member of the famous Mather family (remember the Cotton Mather guy who presided over the Salem Witch Trials?). It is traditionally a mining company, but in 2020, they acquire AK Steel and also ArcelorMittal’s US holdings (in a down market!). Now they’re vertically integrated, mining iron and spewing out high-quality steel.

This mining history and very recent acquisitions are two reasons why so many analysts have overlooked CLF until the last few weeks. The acquisitions are not priced in, except insofar as everyone has ragged on CLF for taking on a lot of debt to do this. Fair, I guess, but have you seen those steel prices? CLF is going to be able to pay its debt down in record time, then start sloughing off cash.  The steel price surge is not yet priced into many steel stocks, and I think CLF has the most room to run out of all of them. 

CLF is also highly likely to benefit from any big infrastructure bill. They have a unionized workforce, and are likely to benefit from government largesse in big construction projects. 

# 🐻🐻🐻 The main risk points
* How did CLF find itself in such an amazing position at the early phase of a commodities supercycle? It’s CEO, the Brazilian Lourenco Goncalves, is a luminary in the steel industry. He engineered CLF’s takeover of Arcelor-Mittal’s US assets and AK Steel in 2020, which put them in this perfect position . He’s also famous for telling a Goldman Saches analyst (with a “hold” rating…) that he was going to embarrass them so badly, they would have to kill themselves.  If Lourenco continues to guide CLF to a preeminent position in steel, a commanding height of the economy, then books will be written about his reign, a la Lee Iacocca. The man is a mastermind — it would be a blow to lose him.   
* A horrendous balance sheet from their 2020 acquisitions. CLF financed last year’s takeovers with expensive debt. However, _this is exactly what the famous CEO said he is fixing first_.  With the enormous steel price increase locked in for the next year, he should be able to pay it down rapidly. This is one of the main reasons this company is still so cheap, imo. The market is cottoning on rapidly, though.
* Biden repeals steel tariffs.
* Commodity prices historically moved in cycles, with occasional “super cycles”, which are more extended periods of high demand. Analysts are increasingly reporting that we’re moving into a supercycle. The risk here is that something kills the supercycle. For example, the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 killed the last supercycle. 
* High short interest. With all of this positive news, you may be shocked - shocked!! - that there are a lot of folks on Wall Street who have decided to short this all-American company.  [Ortex reported short interest at 11.26% the other day](https://u.teknik.io/vR4rH.png) What idiot shorts a vertically integrated steel company when steel prices are surging out of control, I don’t know, but this is apparently the situation. There are deep-pocketed people with an interest in keeping this big steel dog down.

# 🏗🏗🏗🚜🌝TL;DR
The breakout that began yesterday has been brewing for a long time.  CLF mooning, potentially for years if a supercycle/inflation keeps up.  Buy and hold (shares or LEAPs), then reassess market in Q3 or Q4."
2021-05-05 10:40:32,wallstreetbets,"Not sure I agree that this will ever be a short squeeze, but with that being said, most of my portfolio is in steel. A vertically integrated steel producer with an undervalued stock during a super cycle? Yes please. Bought in at 16 with a ton of call options with various expirations from June to 1/22. Used the spike yesterday to move my position around take profits / buy more leaps. You can tell by the lack of retracement after yesterdays bounce that this will hit $25 easily."

2021-05-05 11:20:26,wallstreetbets,"Hijacking top comment to remind people that proxy voting materials are available for most brokers.

FAQ Edit:

Q: Should I vote?

A: YES

Q: Why should I vote?

A: You should vote because naked short selling will cause issues with shares being used to vote more than once. One of the easiest ways to prove that there is duplicate voting is for vote counts to come back incorrectly. This would certainly be the case if everyone voted!

Q: How can I vote?

A: Your broker likely has a specific tab or interface for proxy voting materials in general, which is where you should find the GME vote. Many brokers will email you as well!

Q: What should I vote for?

A: Vote however you would like, but do know that the board unanimously suggests you vote “FOR” on all options."

Those videos where they “talk to you”, like you’re a 6 year old who thinks they actually are talking to you, are cringe. Let’s be honest though, most workout equipment like Peloton is aimed for the rich market. Most gyms aren’t going to shell out the money for one of those machines. If you’re in the gym, that’s the motivation itself that got you in there."

The GameStop saga is a long one, and a more recent development in this sub. You may not see a lot of posts about it anymore and that is because it sort of took over WSB for almost a couple months before being relegated to its own subreddit(s).

The GameStop (or GME) thesis has multiple angles, with the most important two being arguably the a) transformation and b) short squeeze. Personally, I find that the transformation thesis provides long-term strategy and growth, and the short squeeze thesis is just the cherry on top.

So why GameStop?

GameStop has traditionally been a brick-and-mortar retailer (you will see this said often, it’s a bit of a media buzzword), but as of last year this trajectory has been changing. As you can imagine, COVID wreaked havoc on GameStop and similarly physical-location based companies (see also AMC). This decline in sales led to a relatively grave outlook for the company’s physical locations, but gave rise to the opportunity for a business transformation (the transformation thesis). Particularly, Ryan Cohen, ex-CEO of Chewy.com invested into GameStop and became not only a large shareholder, but a voice for change in the company. Chewy.com was his previous commercial success in which he carved out a market for pet food in the e-commerce space by focusing on quality and customer satisfaction. This is the vision he and his colleagues have for the future of GameStop.

The short squeeze thesis comes about as a result of financial institutions betting against GameStop (short selling) by which they actually sell now and buy later, expecting the stock price to drop. If the stock were to reach 0, these short sellers would not have to purchase shares to cover what they sold. This fact, along with the perceived decline in the company (and the fact that the company had serious debts!) led the stock to become the most shorted major stock. At the time, the amount of short positions was reported as greater than the total number of issued shares by the company. This led to the first squeeze (not necessarily a short squeeze!) and was halted before crashing back down to Earth. After resting at around $40 for a while, GameStop is now back at around $160. Keep in mind most short positions would have been established at or below about $20!

There’s a lot more to be said and a lot that happened that may be important to cover but that is the general idea. Wall Street bet heavily against GME, and may see that come back to bite them. We shall see how it plays out!"

“Durrr, Melvin lost soo much money!”

“So that means they covered then..”

“No! They’re using dark pools, short ladders, and finger guns to hide their real position. They lost 49% but they’re still all in on shorting it!! It’s going to $1m a share!!”

But who knows? A united CANZUK free trade bloc that either includes the US or gets a special relationship pact formed with the US would go a long way for the UK's brexit being worth it. It would also set up trade leverage when talking with other non-EU/CN/RU countries like Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the big LatAms, etc"

I dont know if the previous post made it to WSB. Been lurking here for awhile posting comments here and there. Here is the link to my previous post.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfom5q/long_oil/

TLDR: Still have my calls however I sold some at the top in March and bought more since then. Fully levered to specifically OXY and XOM. 

XOM Calls:
171 $80 calls for 1/21/22
63 $75 calls for 1/21/22
87 $70 calls for 1/21/22
22 $60 calls for 1/21/22

OXY Calls:
21 $40 calls for 1/20/23

Now for some details. As of yesterday we got our first clear indication that the reflation trade is on like donkey kong. The API estimate for supplies for oil were a huge draw in inventory. https://twitter.com/chigrl/status/1389680376545697798 

This has been slowly building with other investment banks earlier this year saying that oil production is in a major deficit and will significantly effect the price per BBL later in this year. As of right now we have Goldman Sachs at $80 by this fall (https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Goldman-Oil-To-Hit-80-On-Largest-Ever-Demand-Jump.html) JPM at $75 by this fall, Morgan Stanley at $60 for the year but $75 this fall, and other major investment banks that have gone balls deep in betting on the oil price environment. So clearly, they see something coming this year that hasnt accurately been priced in to the energy sector through the share price. (Ignoring the small cap energy names and talking about the large caps and Majors IE XOM, CVX, PXD, OXY, FANG, EOG, MRO and maybe you would look at ConocoPhillips..)

This brings me to my next point, all those companies have told investors that the plan to keep production flat to return money to shareholders. That means that if demand returns to pre-Covid levels in the near term we will have a significant supply deficit on our hands. Now lets look at the EIA data (next data dump from them is later today around 10:30 CST.)

Here is the general link for the EIA Gasoline Supply ( https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/ ) Key takeaways from this is that Gasoline demand is up and continuing to increase, additionally, the EIA reported on their outlook for the summer driving season and they estimated that the price of gasoline would increase alongside with the increase in driving that we might see due to pandemic being handled. Specifically, the Biden Administration has set July 4th as the date for true reopening assuming we can get enough people vaccinated. I see this as a key date to watch. People seem restless after being locked up all year and want to take a vacation especially since the prices of vacations are cheaper and most families having the most liquidity that they have ever had on record. https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/archive/2021/210407/includes/analysis_print.php

Now that seems to be a pretty rosy outlook for gasoline demand and trucking diesel has already surpassed last year precovid levels back in March. So that means travel and transportationa are up. Now lets look at air travel which would add more demand to the supply chain. https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47756

As you can see in the link EIA shows that we are moving in an upward direction in air travel but I would expect this to slowly keep rebounding this year while coming back to the original usage next year. 

Now lets look at production, something that is heavily debated amongst oil bulls/bears. EIA has revised their production estimates 3 times this year downward because of lack of capital going to replace the production. https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47056

That 8% drop from 2020 to the previous estimate was a shock to some but now the EIA predicts that the US will produce 10.9 MMBPD which some think is a stretch due to the amount of drilling required to bring production to a level that we were at in 2020 and 2019. https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_oil_rotary_rigs

The US has been slowly adding rigs to keep drilling new HZ wells that will help keep the production flat however, due to the extreme decline curve of HZ wells (they decline about 67% in the first year) both the amount of wells being drilled and completed will need to dramatically increase to meet the demand. Roughly speaking it will take an operator about 20 days to drill a well to total depth and completion according to SM at the beginning of the year however they are one of the fastest drilling and completion teams in the Permain Basin. https://s22.q4cdn.com/545644856/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/4Q20-SM-Energy-Presentation.pdf SLIDE 14

Also something to consider is the fact that most operators now drill and complete wells in large groups nicknamed the ""Cube"" (for SM its about 8 but some go so far as 36 at once.) So wells drilled in this style would take between 160-720 days. (Now for a less aggressive estimate we can assume that some companies complete multiple wells together and this is known as Simulfrac which would cut the completion time in half for large groups. For sake of optimism lets just say 80-360 days. This means wells that are drilled now wont be online to keep production flat until about fall at the earliest and next year at the latest.

All this info is to setup the big kicker. With our boi J-POW printing like no ones business and Oil being priced in dollars across the world we can also get some weird inflationary pressure due to the dollar getting weaker. Alongside with the interest rates coming higher and investors flocking to safer boomer dividend stocks. That is why I took agressive bets on XOM. This is the biggest boomer of all. They are incredible about producing around the world, refining, and getting great prices for their products. 

OXY's bet is for a separate post but it boils down to this being a company that might be too indebted to survive unless they get $65 oil which as of yesterday we are there. They have torque to the oil and gas market and should be able to pay down debt thus making them financially solvent and increasing the share price. 

Hold on to your bootstraps boys. This year is going to be wild for Oil and Gas companies. There are a couple of risks to this theory but with the API information and IRAN posting a video about blowing up congress it looks like Repubs are going to want to get tough on Iran and not sign a new deal. That leaves roughly 2MMBOPD off the market. Venezuela just decreased production to 500mBOPD which is terrible considering the size of their reserves. My case actually still works for this year even if both Iran and OPEC+ start pumping due to the demand rebound that will cause a terrific spike in prices. 

This is my own opinion and I am probably retarded so dont take anything as fact but I think its setting pretty nicely.. GLHF.

Edit: forgot to mention I’ll update this when the EIA numbers come out.

However, one thing I do understand is science, and I believe oil is undervalued because environmental activists are severely over estimating the ability for us to phase out fossil fuels.

The only thing that can viably replace natural gas, coal, and oil on the electric grid is nuclear. And while I think nuclear power will expand, there are regulations that have stifled the nuclear industry since the 80's that just aren't going away. Nobody wants to live near a nuclear reactor no matter how many guys in lab coats reassure everyone that it's safe. 

So yea, until they invent nuclear fusion generators, which are as hypothetical as the warp drive or time machine (they involve creating a small sun in a box), energy demands are going to continue to rise, and oil companies will follow suit."

2021-05-05 10:32:29,wallstreetbets,"Only the stupid still invest in Oil.

There are only 2 options it pays out, but everyone is fucked.

2021-05-05 13:49:00,wallstreetbets,I'm with ya on that. Oil will run with inflation and reopening. Need to watch out for debt heavy ones tho. Interest rates going up will hurt them. My oil portfolio is bad at this point. I don't know how I keep doing this. I have a debt heave small cap and ENB. Yet I think lower debt mid cap is the play. Anyone else questioning why their portfolio and their game plan look completely different?
2021-05-05 09:49:25,wallstreetbets,Really depends on OPEC+ being together and singing kumbayah. If they break ranks then it’s all for naught. They have quite a lot of supply being curtailed. Also see Iran and Libya’s production coming back online. Figure I would elaborate on the downside
2021-05-05 09:58:44,wallstreetbets,BP BP BP
2021-05-05 13:36:16,wallstreetbets,XOM is the way
2021-05-05 09:18:34,wallstreetbets,Yeah stick with u undervalued o/g companies
2021-05-05 09:19:44,wallstreetbets,Work in O/G just figured I would share some musings that I have had recently.
2021-05-05 11:06:47,wallstreetbets,"I have only one issue with BP and it’s more of a management issue. They are the literal worst operator in the Permian. Hands down. I have some serious biases to that company and their portfolio is more tilted to Natural Gas which is going to have a huge spike if we have a colder winter. 

Still a great trade just not as comfortable with the company from a macro perspective."
2021-05-05 13:34:49,wallstreetbets,This world we live in can not survive without oil.
2021-05-05 09:19:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah my dude. Only way to view Reddit on my comp.
2021-05-05 11:03:17,wallstreetbets,Yeah same. It marked multiple posts last year as spam and the link I put for my previous DD was spam as well. Lol. But that’s fine. Less investors which is more shares to pick up.
2021-05-05 12:36:01,wallstreetbets,Doing good bro - today is a really good day lol
2021-05-05 09:25:50,wallstreetbets,I would even go so far as to look at EOG
2021-05-05 11:05:12,wallstreetbets,Just because long term it’s going to decrease doesn’t mean it’s not a good trade
2021-05-05 11:03:50,wallstreetbets,Wow. You caught the SM trend. The only issue I have with SM is that they have a inventory problem.
2021-05-05 09:46:15,wallstreetbets,But my house is powered by nuclear...
2021-05-05 13:37:23,wallstreetbets,I have VGTDF it’s a good cheap oil stock at 0.005 right now. Not financial advice.
2021-05-05 11:04:37,wallstreetbets,Exactly. It’s a great trade that might have repercussions in the next 2-3 years if we don’t see significant reinvestment.
2021-05-05 11:02:22,wallstreetbets,No a huge fan because the capital required. If you have the risk tolerance then I would do it. It’s more reward but significantly higher risk. I like the fundamentals of the O/G companies post Covid because they have to keep returning money to investors.
2021-05-05 13:38:14,wallstreetbets,Hah. Apache is now run by decent management but I can never forgive them for the alpine high. What a fucking nightmare of a “prospect”. They paid a EOG geologist a shitload of money to find a “new” prospect. Then the touted it as the greatest thing since sliced bread and gas prices went negative in the Delaware basin and all the wells produced was gas and NGL’s. But their international prospects are good now
2021-05-05 15:57:41,wallstreetbets,MRO is a great company I just don’t understand why they keep trying to make unprofitable wells in the Permian through the deepest wells. (They use another company to run the data through.) Bosque. Their office is like down the street. They did great cost cutting initiatives.
2021-05-05 13:36:15,wallstreetbets,Totally agree nuclear is fucking awesome. Especially small modular reactors.
2021-05-05 13:40:07,wallstreetbets,Do it. Feel the oil flow through you.
2021-05-05 14:11:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m a “bag holder” the geology looks good but may have a hard time getting to it considering how far in Alaska it is. I would look at $RECAF. That shit is legitimate and actually might be the last large onshore vertical development yet undiscovered.
2021-05-05 11:11:27,wallstreetbets,I understand the extremely long term view but I’d love to know what your timeframe is on the reduction of oil consumption. Please send me some link and I’ll read and give you my thoughts. I’m not set in stone just like hearing opinions
2021-05-05 08:18:39,wallstreetbets,I do.... But.... Tendies?
2021-05-05 08:12:37,wallstreetbets,Only people with out a soul invests in oil
2021-05-05 09:16:12,wallstreetbets,Amazon is trying with Project Fireball
2021-05-05 07:54:23,wallstreetbets,"My pleasure!   Our sub is what it is because of great OC like this.

Thank you for your efforts!"
2021-05-05 13:35:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the bet is that service costs which have been crushed and essentially put to break even costs are starting to come back up. Really interesting is the efrac units that everyone is talking about that essentially is a ton more capital than an old diesel unit but they are more efficient and can frac more well simultaneously. That means service ops efficiencies should increase leading to higher margins. However I’m not a petro engineer and the newest stuff is about where my knowledge base ends.

Some of the crazier chemistry and mud based water fracs that reduce costs read in English but I barely understand a word. Net, net, it’s a positive sign. Still a ton of room to run"
2021-05-05 17:00:52,wallstreetbets,MRO is more levered to oil price than XOM but I think OXY’s outlook is so uncertain that if they pull it off then they will outperform
2021-05-05 11:05:43,wallstreetbets,I'll take stupid and rich any day of the week.
2021-05-05 11:12:41,wallstreetbets,Sure I agree the long term charts aren’t great and the long term outlook might be bad but in the near term it’s still a huge component of the energy usage which makes it a great trade
2021-05-05 14:46:56,wallstreetbets,"I like Mid Cap companies committed to shareholder return AKA aggressive debt paydown and showing the ability to distribute a decent dividend. The days of growth through the drill bit are over. Goal will be to slightly grow production through efficiency and quality assets, all while preparing for the consolidation phase the industry will see in a year. Growth will be through acquisitions going forward. At this point, I don't think you can go wrong riding with a good strategy and balance sheet."
2021-05-05 09:23:48,wallstreetbets,O/G wage slave here as well. The writing was on the wall since about November 2020 that drill baby drill is over. UOPEC (united organization of petroleum exploiting corporations) realized finally that saudi was right. The spice must flow but if you flow less you end up making the same so why work harder and deplete your reserves faster?
2021-05-05 16:46:43,wallstreetbets,"BP's price is moving at a glacial pace but I like the company among the oil majors.  The buy back announcement didn't do much along with their absurd trading profit; they need to get the previous dividend reinstated.  Also, with their green push, I have a hope they will long term get out from under ESG restrictions and get back into boomer portfolios."
2021-05-05 11:08:55,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure about the inventory..... but I do know I was in at $1.50 and been riding it ever since!
2021-05-05 09:54:26,wallstreetbets,"Doesn’t matter. I recommend saving some time by not calling your utilities, instead just get an axe and hack away at the power mains."
2021-05-05 11:01:22,wallstreetbets,"And the guys working there drive gas car to there. The parts are shipped by diesel trucks. The designer use gas to get to work. The food you eat is grown with gas.

No gas -> the world grinds to a stop.

We are chipping away at gas VERY slowly."
2021-05-05 09:13:21,wallstreetbets,Oh fuck right off of that high horse I bet your portfolio is filled with blood money unless your portfolio is 100% st Jude stocks
2021-05-05 09:05:36,wallstreetbets,I completely agree with you. Fuck oil. Let boomers sit on that while the rest of the world moves on.  Now smash that fucking downvote button.
2021-05-05 09:25:00,wallstreetbets,Lol actually the minute it went negative I bought everything I could. I had cdev calls that I thought would expire worthless in Jan but they cranked. Wish I was in the SM play before it popped
2021-05-05 11:18:24,wallstreetbets,Yeah so their position in the Permian basin is getting tight. They have a couple years to go but the rock gets significantly less productive the rumor is that they are looking for more inventory. That’s why their most recent IR presentation keeps touting the Eagle Ford
2021-05-05 09:10:03,wallstreetbets,I'll give you an upvote.

2021-05-05 06:53:07,wallstreetbets,"Futures are higher this morning, rebounding from the ‘Yellen head-fake’ that caused a bunch of selling yesterday afternoon. Small caps are leading the move higher, with the Russell 2000 up 0.7%. Nasdaq is up 0.6%. S&P and Dow up about 0.3%. Russell and Nasdaq also saw the brunt of the damage yesterday, giving up almost 2% each.

We do get to hear from a couple of FOMC members: Eric Rosengren, Loretta Mester, and Charles Evans. Not sure if they’re taking questions but if so you can bet they’ll be asked about Yellen’s comments. 

My thoughts on Yellen and the Fed: Need to listen to the audio. Not gonna type it.

ADP payrolls are due out at 0815. Economists expecting 800k jobs added in April, quite a bit more than the 517k from March. We also get ISM services data at 10am. These are a couple of key reports where the health of the economy is concerned. As always, you need to watch for the Goldilocks scenario: too hot and it means inflation and Fed tightening. Too cold and the economy is not recovering quickly or strongly enough. Though nowadays, maybe the ‘too cold’ scenario is preferred.

More earnings today as well: Hilton Worldwide just came out with a miss. GM, Allstate, and Etsy report later. After the bell we get Uber, Booking Holdings, and PayPal."

How many of you trade this way? I've usually leaned towards ITM to leverage while having a higher chance of success but it seems like if you don't get greedy you can play pretty far OTM and do alright. Got a XOM 70C to give it a try"

https://i.imgur.com/2OTdrL7.jpg

Wouldn't be surprised, at all, to see Nasdaq at $11,000 within a couple months if not quicker, these drops can happen REALLY fast as we've seen in this market, once they pick up some steam. Then V-shaped recovery once the big boys have stopped liquidating, margin calls and de-leveraging is completed, and the big boys then take their free Federal Reserve money, and pump it back up once all the forced selling is done. Better believe they've used the last couple weeks of quiet markets to slowly start unloading at QQQ double top, whilst retail tried chasing all those failed break outs. Now they're taking your calls premiums, taking their profits on this rally, forcing a decent pull back so they can actually buy again at semi-reasonable prices. $11,000 is still hugely over-valued, though. If Biden can get ALL his spending through, then this market will keep going higher, especially if it is without tax increases... But its all inflation, at this stage... The economy isn't getting better, but companies make more revenue and higher profits, because there's simply MORE money and everything simply costs MORE. That's not economic growth or prosperity, it is a bubble and inflation and we either prick it soon or hyper-inflate.

That's why I stick bearish on stocks especially the over-priced tech names, and bullish on precious metals. It hasn't worked out yet, but eventually we'll either get a collapse in stocks with the Fed going absolutely berserk with money printing, or we'll continue higher and higher and higher and hyper-inflation is the name of the game and my gold investments will do way better than my smaller bear bets on the market (especially QQQ/Nasdaq)."

On March 23 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** strike leap calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **96.94** which gives us a total value of:

This will interact with ihealth and share data that is collected on that app with your doctor. The only catch is that your doctor will have to adopt well healths Oscar EMR platform (and pay their recurring revenues) in order to have this option available to their clients/patients. The only app in Canada that interacts with the iPhone.  This will be a big driving force behind forcing clinics to adopt the Oscar EMR platform provides by well (one of the highest margin aspects of Well) and will likely lead to each of these clinics adopting other offerings by WELL as well. Huge news for well health and all Canadians as it will allow anyone to collect health data and share it with their doctor to improve health outcomes!!

2021-05-05 11:09:44,wallstreetbets,Why back? You just want to peak and then quickly fall again?
2021-05-05 11:10:46,wallstreetbets,Why do you wanna come back from the moon lol that means losing.

2021-05-05 11:54:39,wallstreetbets,Agree. It’s so expensive for them to do recalls. Literally have to go to every single home and tear down the treadmill then transport it back. You cant mail a peloton back

2021-05-05 13:57:29,wallstreetbets,Good bot 😘
2021-05-05 14:01:13,wallstreetbets,"Good questions to consider. If I held the stock I'd consider dipping out at $90-95 so I think if that logic carried over to my leap then I'd consider selling when the underlying gets closer to those values. TBH if I had the cash I'd probably just pad my CSP fund or just buy more AAPL shares.

I think after some reflection I'll hold and let it go a bit more."

On the bad side, tech selloff, overall pattern of sell the news, general FUD."
2021-05-05 07:18:48,wallstreetbets,What would you do? SPY vs TSLA
2021-05-05 08:21:56,wallstreetbets,If you compare That's eps to competitors then it should be in the $40-$50 range. RKT is also growing with a new auto division so it is expanding too.

2021-05-05 12:26:01,wallstreetbets,"I hear ya, only money I've made recently was basically pure luck and its getting old real fast. Boomers want to tell us we're treating the market like a casino, if the odds are the same basically why wouldn't we???"

2021-05-05 06:58:54,wallstreetbets,"Extremely helpful. Thanks. Forgot about the 11th. Been noting the increasing institutional support though, good stuff."

2021-05-05 15:55:57,wallstreetbets,"You don't have to tell me, RKT is the dumbest thing I did in 2020 and the pain never ends."
2021-05-05 12:29:29,wallstreetbets,"I'm not even trying to gamble on stocks. I'm trying to look at longer options, but everything I've purchased starts dropping as soon as I do. It's insane. CLF has been a really good one though."
2021-05-05 12:47:03,wallstreetbets,"Oh I know I'm not either. I'm just saying that Boomers keep complaining about today's traders treating the market like a Casino. But if buying on good fundamentals and a strong outlook isn't making folks money(which is what keeps happening to me) of course they're going to start treating the market like their own personal casino, why bother with research and careful planning if the odds are still stacked against you to make money?  I'd probably have made the same amount of money by now if I had just taken my money to the casino haha. Good to know on CLF tho, I'll check it out."

2021-05-05 11:23:36,wallstreetbets,Hahaha. Exactly. Use to sleep through class and they would slam a text book on my desk to startle me in front of the class. I’d politely ask how much their annual salary was. Then walk the fuck out. And my mother was a principle In the district. 🤦‍♂️. My bad mom

2021-05-05 11:21:03,wallstreetbets,I apologize for adding my age. I just thought it’s interesting that the younger generation wants a part of the market as much as the boomer gen thinks they own it. My bad I won’t post that again.

It went down during the MRNA spike a year ago (pre quarantine at around $30) and they tried to settle with a class action. I was an early adopter but the MRNA thing was such bullshit and I bounced. It’s an unreliable platform and extremely disingenuous.

2021-05-05 10:11:12,wallstreetbets,Dissing?  Do kids still say that?
2021-05-05 14:47:29,wallstreetbets,"AMC was never anything but a diversion from GME by people who had cousins in the entertainment industry trying to balance their GME losses.

AMC is double-fucking you: first in removing capital from GME, second in giving money to the people who are shorting GME.

On top of it: it's a legit-dying-industry, no one wants to sit in a room full of random fat smelly loud retards who laugh at all the wrong times to take in the latest propaganda when they can do that from the comfort of their own homes with fat smelly loud retards who laugh at all the wrong times but are related to them or are otherwise interested in their genitals.

2021-05-05 08:52:34,wallstreetbets,What does sold out graphics card have todo with movies?
2021-05-05 09:33:42,wallstreetbets,"Ye but the graphic card is something you could get at any point during the pandemic, going to a movie is for the experience and in general ppl havent had the option to go to a movie for  a year now so he kinda has a point"
2021-05-05 09:43:49,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget Scott Pilgrim
2021-05-05 04:20:53,wallstreetbets,And they’re actually playing in theatres? I literally haven’t seen a new movie in over a year. All the theatres where I live are still closed.
2021-05-05 04:28:11,wallstreetbets,"For their earnings on the 6th AM? 

Yeah, amc gonna dip when they report -500m cost with no real revenue generated for Q1. 

Movie theaters haven’t been open long enough for them to have bullish outlook and no real movies have came out either."
2021-05-05 11:32:15,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, as you can tell I don't really now what I'm doing  I guess I just like the instant control of the mobile apps but I'll look into it thanks!"

Im totally new to all the stock investing stuff as well. Im trying to learn as I go I suppose"
2021-05-05 09:03:06,wallstreetbets,Ya total new to the stock world. Just decided to grow up at age 40 and to start thinking about my life and future.
2021-05-05 09:07:10,wallstreetbets,Id like to note as well that over $700 to a person like me is a significant amount of money. I really have not much. Just working with what I can. Im trying to learn as I go...maybe not the smartest way but im just working with what Ive got is all
2021-05-05 10:24:02,wallstreetbets,What does this even mean?
2021-05-05 03:50:55,wallstreetbets,Fair. Did not expect a response. Cheers.
2021-05-05 11:24:56,wallstreetbets,The fact that people are even considering AMC when GME was the play all along.
2021-05-05 09:49:08,wallstreetbets,"None of that matters, only things that matter is WHAT moves the stock"
2021-05-05 05:40:16,wallstreetbets,They just listed ureleased movies and 1 that was on hbo max lol
2021-05-05 08:40:13,wallstreetbets,Godzilla vs Kong dude
2021-05-05 12:04:46,wallstreetbets,">And they’re actually playing in theatres? I literally haven’t seen a new movie in over a year. All the theatres where I live are still closed.

Funny since all bar and grills have been wide open here for months sitting 2 blocks away from a closed theater. The theaters at least could have ample spacing with closing 1-2 rows. I don't get it."
2021-05-05 10:12:51,wallstreetbets,Feels like they should call it something other than “earnings” for a company like amc
2021-05-05 11:32:50,wallstreetbets,"TD, Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard. Nothing else"
2021-05-05 16:47:04,wallstreetbets,"This forum is NOT about investing.. it is about stupid gambling 
This site is for entertainment only"
2021-05-05 10:44:40,wallstreetbets,"So, this isn't a zing at however many shares you can afford in the slightest, but 100 share round lots are a hell of a lot easier to dollar cost average down than 50 share purchases. Learn what a covered call is. Covered calls are way better than naked stock purchases for people looking to make some money without blowing up their account and reducing risk. $AMC still has a ton of IV/premium in it, so you can easily make that $5 gap back in a few months by selling slightly out-of-the-money calls.

It's very, very likely not going back to $14 though, so if you want to dig yourself out and make the money back, get yourself another 50 shares (which are already 50% off your original purchase, so you only need to climb back to $12ish via premiums) and start writing calls against it.

More than happy to help more if you want to DM me."
2021-05-05 10:42:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah well in the future don’t jump onto a company that’s spiking irrationally that is in a dying industry.  

This really isn’t the place for you to learn, it’s a group of high risk traders who are okay losing big money.  Somewhere like r/investing may be better.  Investopedia has a ton of good resources as well."
2021-05-05 10:33:27,wallstreetbets,"He's trying to act like a rich asshole; saying 50@14 is not anything to worry about. No, not just saying that, he is literally ridiculing by laughing at him. What an asshole"
2021-05-05 11:33:50,wallstreetbets,"Bet, appreciate your comment, I'll look into them!"
2021-05-05 14:10:36,wallstreetbets,Which one of those do you think has the best mobile interface?
2021-05-05 17:41:52,wallstreetbets,Word
2021-05-05 14:41:23,wallstreetbets,I can tell you it sure as fuck isn’t Fidelity.
2021-05-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"To comment or not to comment? (Thoughts about Yellen's Statement) US Treasury Yellen made a statement of fact, based on years of experience with economics and financial markets, that “interest rates may have to modestly rise to prevent overheating of the economy” as the government spends trillions of USD to stimulate the economy. The market sold off violently in reaction, with growth stock-heavy index Nasdaq falling more than 3% at one stage. 

Within hours, both the White House and Yellen walked back on her comments. She said herself that it was neither a recommendation to the Federal Reserve nor a prediction. Just how sensitive are the policymakers to the market reactions?

Did she not know that her comments would have a negative impact on the stock market? It would be interesting to hear what Yellen and Powell have to say in the days ahead. Powell has been consistent in saying that this is not time to talk about talking about interest rates hikes and Yellen has somehow managed to scare the market with a comment alluding to talking about hikes. 

It’s likely that they will be more careful in the days ahead as for Yellen to be able to push for tax hikes, they do need a healthy and buoyant asset market."
2021-05-05 02:24:29,wallstreetbets,She knows very well the effect her statements haveand she probably bought the dip.
2021-05-05 03:41:41,wallstreetbets,"Backpedaling, she let the cat out of the bag. The market is unstable. Her or jpowell can say one thing wrong and it will fall apart. People still aren’t working and people are choosing not to work. Doesn’t seem stable to me"
2021-05-05 02:16:55,wallstreetbets,"They are definitely downplaying the issue. It seems like every day they're trying to reassure us everything is fine, there's no inflation, rates won't won't up, etc. But look at commodities. Corn futures tripled. Lumber quadrupled? Everything is getting more expensive and money is being printed at unprecedented rates. They can't turn off the printer cause then it'll crash everything. But if they leave it on it just kicks the can further diwn and makes it worse."
2021-05-05 07:42:21,wallstreetbets,one red day down 1.0% with an afternoon recovery of 0.5% and everyone and their mom is freaking out.
2021-05-05 01:58:45,wallstreetbets,If the stock market is healthy and the economy is healthy then a rate raise wouldn’t hurt the market
2021-05-05 04:26:18,wallstreetbets,JPOW turn the printer off bruv
2021-05-05 01:53:19,wallstreetbets,"I would be jellen
  if it wasn't for Yellen"
2021-05-05 03:05:33,wallstreetbets,"Maybe her words had their intended effect to drop the market down from the peak frothiness it's been having the last few months.  A few words, a dip, clarify the words, and watch what happened.  Somebody ran for the exits based on those words.  Was it retail?  Not likely, probably more institutional, in which case they've capitalized on some gains and have some cash in hand.  Mission accomplished.  I think she'll say something similar in a month or so again to dampen the exuberant highs and attempt to limit the potential amplitude of a future correction."
2021-05-05 04:07:23,wallstreetbets,"I like JPow’s ability to stay focused on his own job, even when interviewers try to lead him down a question outside his job scope. 

Not sure if Yellen genuinely had a bit of cognitive impairment there in her 70s, or was acting out a good cop / bad cop thing, but officials facing midterm losses would be wise to encourage Yellen to minimize those types of fumbles."
2021-05-05 01:59:41,wallstreetbets,Id be yelled if it wasn’t for jellen
2021-05-05 02:23:33,wallstreetbets,I didn’t read the entire post... after too many words my eyes cross and my clothes come off
2021-05-05 08:30:41,wallstreetbets,"She was engaging in trying to form market 'expectations'. She believes that the mere talk of an action is enough to change behaviour.

These people really are loose cannons. Just months ago they were talking about no interest rate changes until 2023. 

Nobody believes them anymore, they have lost credibility. Everyone knows there is rampant inflation and so is taking measures.

They should refrain from injecting more stimulus as all the forward buying to beat inflation is stimulating the market enough. They'll have reason enough to stimulate  the market once that turns as it's simply a timing difference."
2021-05-05 13:56:49,wallstreetbets,"She did so Powell wouldn’t have to because of his claim that they are not thinking about thinking about raising rates. At the same time Buffet is saying inflation is here and large, it couldn’t be ignored. So this was a way to address it without actually doing anything. My take"
2021-05-05 02:20:48,wallstreetbets,"She is a terrible treasury secretary, an even worse fed chair, and she tried to his funds from the US government when she was head of UC in an attempt to milk taxpayers for more financing. She doesn't give two shits about the investments of the average person or the overall success of individuals.

Thank God JPow is still chairman of the Fed"
2021-05-05 07:07:06,wallstreetbets,"She's been in this career field for decades.  She was a college professor, appointed by Clinton, etc.  She knows very well what she's doing.  I cannot stress that enough.

EDIT:  I been putting stuff in my mouth for decades.  I know very well what I'm doing.  And she's been doing that longer than I have."
2021-05-05 05:58:44,wallstreetbets,I guess we saw what can happen when someone 'confirms' that rates are going to increase. Before it was only expectations and signals from the bond market. I can only imagine what happens when jpow announces it.

2021-05-05 07:41:39,wallstreetbets,"Exactomondo!!!!!!

They probably drew straws over the weekend.

2021-05-05 04:07:43,wallstreetbets,"They raised rates and that kicked off the sub prime housing market crash in 07. 

What they need to do is bring back fixed interest loans for poor people paying off mortgages. Then they can raise rates without putting people on the street.

But then they can't swoop down like vultures and buy up all the distressed assets for Penny's on the now worthless Dollar. So probably not going to happen."
2021-05-05 06:25:19,wallstreetbets,"The economy is perceived as doing ok, but it's on life support"
2021-05-05 04:18:19,wallstreetbets,"You would think so, but I believe that a lot of the asset price rise is due to the fed expanding balance sheet due to incessant money printing. If that should stop or reverse, there will be some negative impact on asset prices."
2021-05-05 09:08:44,wallstreetbets,This isn’t true. The risk free rate directly affects the value of future cash flows. You have a profound misunderstanding of how equities are valued if you believe this.

2021-05-05 05:43:45,wallstreetbets,"He should be fuming imo. He's been so disciplined and clear about not commenting on fiscal policy, and now Yellen swerves riiiight into his lane and takes a massive dump all over his consistent messaging. Lovely."
2021-05-05 05:47:40,wallstreetbets,Pics or it didn't happen.
2021-05-05 08:00:21,wallstreetbets,Haha and this is why millionaires dont want to be billionaires? They can say when its enough?
2021-05-05 03:00:15,wallstreetbets,Lose?
2021-05-05 05:57:23,wallstreetbets,It's completely fucked. I can't Imagine average Joes paying higher rates on the absolutely crazy mortgage face amounts they needed to buy a house in this overheated market.
2021-05-05 11:57:19,wallstreetbets,"Who is buying arms right now? Lending requirements are still pretty strict so far as I'm aware. 

Rate increases will decrease buying power and may dampen housing prices, but it won't harm anyone with a conventional mortgage apart from maybe dragging recent purchasers underwater.

It may doom bonds and kill some businesses with non fixed loans, but they took on that risk."
2021-05-05 08:27:47,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street knows that the market has maxed and teetering to a major drop.  It was/is expected by June.  The economy is fragile, not talked about inflation has happened.  Building materials, food, fuel, home prices, car prices, and the availability of all of the above.

Almost all manufacturers and suppliers are working on ""just in time"" orders.  This prevents them from major hits on cost of goods being warehoused when kaka hits the fan.  If the manufacturers and suppliers had confidence in the economy, they would be stocking the shelves to overflow."

2021-05-05 17:17:08,wallstreetbets,"In my own completely retarded opinion, listening to this call, their diversification into vehicle sales and creating some of these other partnerships means their long term basis for remaining stable based on the housing market alone isn't going to hold them and will dry up, additionally as home prices go up as the availability dries up, people are getting priced out from being able to afford mortgages which means less business because the gov isn't going to let the market tank, so home worth isn't going to dip into being more affordable. Rocket diversifying means they are concerned about long term cash generation and looking to other sources, so while they can say at the moment they're kicking ass, long term, they're trying to cover expected struggles. If they are stepping out from what's their bread and butter, well....danger Will Robinson.

2021-05-05 03:41:15,wallstreetbets,"Warning: a black swan event could spike the price and wipe you out.

Buy a call for a $24 strike, sell a call for a $23 strike. Since the premium for the $23 should be higher than the $24, you'd get a credit, while putting up $100 for collateral. If the stock never goes up to $23, you keep the credit. If it goes to $24, you lose $100"
2021-05-05 17:32:20,wallstreetbets,"He bought the call option, not stocks. Each call option gives him the ability to purchase 100 shares at strike price ($21 in this case) on strike date (5/7) by paying a premium. Right now the premium is worth 2.03 per share and he bought 100 calls so his +$1000 comes from $0.1 difference in premium from when he bought it and the current price if he chooses to sell the option to someone else. The premium depends on the price of stock vs strike price, volatility, time, etc."

2021-05-05 16:27:44,wallstreetbets,"k so Im checking the earnings and I guess Im just a retarded ape, but EPS is 1.07, compared to EPS estimate of 0.86, isn't that pretty good?"
2021-05-05 17:32:53,wallstreetbets,"Sorry other mortgage companies with weaker financial positions or just other companies in general? 

&#x200B;

While there is no doubt the housing market is on fire (A buddy of mine and his wife run a realtor company and are balls deep in it, raking in more and more in commissions along with their agents), I think that some of the services Rocket has added to turn around the underwrites faster and provide faster customer service and support the agents and brokers more, means they're trying to cash in on as many loans as they can before things dry up as folks are priced out. They're not growing their platform to get deeper into that market, a company that successful doesn't expand on their platform and spend all of that money unless they absolutely have to in order to survive. So while it gives the appearance that ""Hey, we're doing all of this to be badass and drive us long term, in reality, they're trying to eliminate as much loss as they can before the well begins to dry up."
2021-05-05 18:19:27,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, no fundamental reason. Their earnings were amazing and the only reason they're off by that penny is because they're investing in their own growth."

2021-05-05 16:30:48,wallstreetbets,"not sure where youre getting numbers but shows EPS .89, estimate was .90"
2021-05-05 16:30:53,wallstreetbets,Adjusted EPS was $0.89 vs. expected adjusted EPS of $0.90. Regardless of that though there is a lot more than just EPS to look at with earnings. They missed revenue which is probably the main reason why it's tanking so much
2021-05-05 17:33:06,wallstreetbets,"Haha I’m right there with you.

But Peloton has a giant recall because their device killed a kid and was injuring people and pets for a 14.56% drop throughout the day.

RKT saw pretty solid resistance at $22.82 all day when everyone has access to trading, but during after hours, it drops 13.51% with good financial numbers? It might have missed the estimated mark for revenue, but it’s not akin to Peloton.

Who knows though!"
2021-05-05 19:51:48,wallstreetbets,"Well... You also have to consider the cost of the premium. Since he bought it ""in the money"" (price of stock was ~22.8 at the time I think and he bought 21c), it's expensive. So if RKT isn't a decent bit over 21 by 5/7 4pm ET he is majorly screwed."

I don't mind averaging down for a stock with great long term potential.

That's a pretty nice entry point for a stock where the CEO can't sell until it hits $30. A potential short squeeze is icing on the cake, but not necessary to make money if it's a good company."

I'm assuming those options expired and became worthless but honestly I wasn't paying attention or missed that. All I'm saying is there was two different entries of dollar amounts in the SEC Filing. The stock has been hovering around 3.7 where it was initially valued as a SPAC. The only way it moves is by showing positive growth for members, reinvesting revenue is expected, and there are many risks. This stock is no for sure thing but getting in at the ground level if it is also a possibility like any new company, coin, asset, etc. It's natural for people to doubt things until it gains credibility."

2021-05-05 17:31:36,wallstreetbets,"This comment was prophetic.  Burned my June 18 spread options that I though were safe last month.  

Earnings instead missed a little, guidance sucked.  This is a good company in a shaky market right now.  This isn’t hedges shorting it to oblivion.  These are financial analysts who legitimately won’t pay more for a financial company with no commitment to dividends."
2021-05-05 10:22:46,wallstreetbets,"I am long both stock and calls, but somehow I have a feeling this isn't going to launch."
2021-05-05 14:42:58,wallstreetbets,"1. P/E 13.49: Higher than last earnings but that is a good thing IMO as it shows there is future growth expected. For prospective MVIS is -146 meaning it is running on hopes and dreams. TSLA is 583 which means investors are expecting huge exponential growth in the long term to justify the evaluation
2. P/B 5.29: In a perfect sweet spot, not showing signs of distress and slight light higher than undervalued but close enough to warrant undervaluation compared to competitors 
3. P/S 0.142: Investors paying less than $1:$1 on companies sales TSLA 18.06, why is TSLA so high? Because it is a culture shift. RKT is also a culture shift, 100 percent online process for mortgage loans, and their own platform to circumvent old MLS laws that require the use of jobs that shouldn't exist ""Realtor"" and fees. I know people debate that RKT is not a fintech, but isn't it? What is stopping RKT from becoming the Stripe of payments, Plaid for banks, Twillow of messaging, Data Dog for montoring, MongoDB of NoSqQL, but for Mortgage. Now that they have proven API integration with Mint, why would they stop there? Integration with any other platform is now possible. Trust me, I have worked with lots of financial companies and it takes years to stand up a simple service in the cloud using existing infrastructure, let alone an entire industry. 
4. Put call ratio 0.396: Very bullish, but not bullish enough to have a risk of reversal to the downside as there are shorted shares.  

5. We like the stock!"

2021-05-05 01:50:10,wallstreetbets,Its cheap because the stock is a high dividend stock that slowly grows. If you play options with these you are truly silly. Just buy the stock and collect the dividend. You will definitely make more money with less downside. You’re welcome.

2021-05-04 23:32:50,wallstreetbets,"I put out AMC DD earlier in the year and have been right about it.

I do not believe this will continue going up. It's overvalued at this point and the short interest has dissipated. The borrow fee has been dropping \_a lot\_ day to day and there are plenty of available shares to short now. CEO pulled the 500m share reserve proposal due to the dress down he got from shareholders (they said they will come back at this, I'm guessing for a smaller shelf size), but they are still going ahead and actively selling the 43m shares they got left these days. Board never sells unless they think the stock is overvalued. This does not bode well for any squeeze.

I am short calls on AMC, so only one of us will make money. Best of luck."
2021-05-05 10:18:03,wallstreetbets,"AMC dropped again, 5 days in a row,

I still hold and did not sell.

Guess it may bounce back and close at 10 on Friday.

I do wonder if it'll be higher than the projection the CEO mentioned, though. I can see the CEO doing that to maybe soften whatever blow might come from low earnings, he's used the tactic of managing expectations in the past while coming through with results higher than their own supposed stated expectations."

There is chance for gamma squeeze which does not heavily depend on the above factors. This can then evolve into a short squeeze which depends on the aforementioned factors

He knows it's over shorted and he is going to take advantage to clear company debts for long term survival. Do you think a ceo is going to tank his shares by dilution,  are you that stupid? The ceo has his own stake in the company and his children have shares in the company.

They are buying back theaters, opening around the world and the positives are there. Earnings won't be the catalyst but the new sec rules that will be in place for July 29th meeting will be it. If Trey was an employee he would need to say it. I swear this guy is a troll there is no way he is this retarded."

2021-05-05 09:52:00,wallstreetbets,"I think after these rulings that pass amc will be once in a lifetime, the GMC people are dreaming Bc most of the shorts were covered on the run to 500, and AMC became the next target. Much higher interest, utilization, etc etc"
2021-05-05 12:48:02,wallstreetbets,"Like many of the ""meme"" stocks I don't think the people buying (eg: boys) are actually aware of these things like share dilution. When they log into RH and see the graph of share price, that's all they see and understand. 

So reaching $30 seems obtainable. (if things go back to normal, which is the hope)
However they don't get that market cap wise, AMC is already past its previous highs of 5 years ago. 

I think a lot of people who buy into things like AMC are legitimately unaware of actual numbers and fundamentals. 

All of this is not to say that AMC might rip upwards if due to its meme status and tons of people putting on the buying pressure."

2021-05-05 17:41:36,wallstreetbets,One of my biggest questions about this shitty cartel weed; who buys it?
2021-05-05 09:39:28,wallstreetbets,"Ya cause guess what...........TLRY, SNDL, and CGC are CANADIAN companies, i repeat they are CANADIAN companies.  If you want to get into American weed stocks look at Curaleaf, Cresco Labs, Green Thumb Industries, and Trulieve."

2021-05-05 09:41:15,wallstreetbets,"Very hard to prove, unless you literally can't walk in a straight line, or speak properly than you really have nothing to worry about.  Everyone in Canada was freaking out about that but then nothing really came about it."

2021-05-05 08:20:29,wallstreetbets,"I'm pretty pissed at North Carolina as well. The state has a history of growing tobacco and the mountains out west have an incredibly similar climate to the Emerald Triangle where most of the outdoor weed in the US is grown. The state already does pretty well with tourism from the 300 miles of beaches, the tech industry in the Triangle, and the finance sector in Charlotte, but if we could lock down the weed business for the east coast we would be booming. And all the industry is already in place. Tobacco consumption is down and going further down so why not transition to the 21st century cash crop."

2021-05-05 06:58:45,wallstreetbets,"I've lived in 9 states and Louisiana is far and away the most corrupt political system and political people I've ever encountered. Their education system ranks #50 in the U.S. and tbe politicians keep it that way on purpose. Despite raking in $T from oil & gas industry. Sales tax on fruit, milk, bread staples is 10.5% and roads haven't been updated since they were built. Many states don't tax those items. Car insurance is highest in the nation because the system is a scam to line specific people's pockets and nothing else. They ""automated"" the process of traffic court so there's no lawyering, just templates on how much is awarded based on PIP. The people have been raked over coals and intentionally held in poverty and they don't know any better unless they leave for another state. The people are great though. Absolutely best people anywhere"
2021-05-05 03:26:18,wallstreetbets,"Oil though right? Probably not in our lifetimes but eventually that aint gonna sustain them.

Also, why not be even richer?"
2021-05-05 07:58:03,wallstreetbets,It’s roughly the same GDP per capita and we have free healthcare. Better education system too.
2021-05-05 13:42:50,wallstreetbets,"As a former Christian and Texan I can tell you first hand that bullshit is fading away. This state is quickly turning purple and even my conservative Christian parents are on board with legalization. And the whole “no state income” thing is just pandering to conservative voters who don’t realize they are paying way more in property taxes than most states with state income. Schools, roads, public safety all have budgets and the money has to come from somewhere. I guess one advantage of higher property tax is that the money is spent more locally, but I’m sure there are cons e.g. uneven distribution of tax money for low-income school districts vs rich school districts.

I had the building code enforcer victim blame me for not reading non existent reviews for a building that went to shit under new management. Transit is a joke. They've passed on opportunities to improve transit and internet infrastructure. The little guy is not protected here. And the police were so corrupt the feds were involved for years in review. Try calling 911 (I'm talking 10 years ago before CHOP) they might show up after 45min and might not bother. Three years ago good luck getting through on the non emergency number. I was on the endless ring for no lie an hr before just giving up.

2021-05-05 16:07:10,wallstreetbets,Wasn't the destruction of the wet lands a huge part of the problem?
2021-05-05 08:02:50,wallstreetbets,The *movie* I thought was before that. They claim homelessness is a housing problem there and not the drug problem. Which is nuts
2021-05-05 08:24:20,wallstreetbets,"Ah, yea that movie may have been before CHOP. It's probably a mix of those issues. Micro studios (parking space size units) are like 1000 and that's probably the most logical type of apt to get yourself if you have nothing. After these short six month leases these places have, even those go up like $200-300/mo. There's just too much upward rent pressure bc of things like Amazon employee apt vouchers and those with high salaries. The (I'm sure a popular market strategy elsewhere, too) strategy of pushing rents even with vacancies at the property is real here so there's probably less of a housing shortage as appears to be to boot."
2021-05-05 16:06:12,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure homelessness is a housing problem.  


Utah did a project where they created new low income housing opportunities where you pay 30% and they have a social worker in the house that can help you with your drug abuse and addiction issues.  


Like drugs are a symptom. Every rat study shows that if you give a rat a choice between drugs and anything they'll do drugs, but if you enrich the rat's life they'll abstain from the drugs.  


Drugs are only a problem if you don't let there be any solution. If you try to get help and cops are waiting outside of a methadone clinic to try and bust you if you have any other drugs on you... you're going to have a drug problem.  


If housing is too expensive because you're letting Chinese and Russians buy up all the properties to money launder their funds out of their country and they make the rent high and have 30% occupancy because it's about getting the money out of your country not about like making a profitable business... you're going to have drug problems.

They give a div that takes away money from the bottom line.Their never in the news or trending. They also missed out on some of the GOAT podcast. Spotify and others aren't helping them
2021-05-04 23:21:51,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, 
I have 3 different brokerage accounts chase, ally, and Robinhood. Robinhood nor Ally will let you trade options outside of 5 cent increments(at a price that is so low). I’ve never traded options in my chase account, I’ll check that out soon. 

The current price of 8 cents (or 7 depending on how your brokerage averages the price) is simply because the bid is 5cents, and the ask is 10 cents, giving an average displayed price, or market value, of 8cents. (Or 7....) but you can’t place a limit at something other then the 5 cents increments. That I know of.... If you can, tell me what brokerage your using."
2021-05-04 23:29:03,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I agree with everything you said, but considering the dept, at least it’s structured in a way they still turn a minimal profit. Guess there is no feasible end to the debt sure. But that’s most companies.

I will say The earnings call didn’t sound that bad at all. It’s nothing to brag about, but I don’t see it being reason enough to be stuck at 6$ I feel like I’m
Missing something. They arnt heavily shorted."
2021-05-04 23:35:14,wallstreetbets,"There is no simply, everything on the market has an exact price. You might not be allowed to trade in other increments because your broker doesn’t want more transactions it needs to exchange. But there will be an eleven. There always is."

2021-05-05 00:03:04,wallstreetbets,Yes dude. Get yourself Streetsmart Edge as well on their platform. It’s pretty great for trading.
2021-05-04 22:37:49,wallstreetbets,I just went to TD. How long does it usually take?

2021-05-05 05:47:19,wallstreetbets,Fid won't let you place limit sells at more than 50% profit. Glad I never put anything but play money in that account.
2021-05-04 22:44:58,wallstreetbets,"streetsmart edge baby, it's big brain time"
2021-05-05 03:08:34,wallstreetbets,Charles Schwab absolutely sucks. I've been stuck with them since January but I have a Fidelity account and they're amazing in comparison. But hey at least you left RH.
2021-05-05 03:25:07,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity ATP is good. Also their strategy training team is awesome. But would be better if/when they add VWAP and HOTKEYS. 
Any day traders used both and can compare/why IBKR may be better?"
2021-05-05 03:58:08,wallstreetbets,SoFi any good??
2021-05-05 09:00:27,wallstreetbets,I’m using TD because fidelity UI sucks but that’s got to know they’re going to change

2021-05-05 11:33:55,wallstreetbets,You need to buy 2 more shares. That 1648 would drive me crazy looking at it. Like something is missing

2021-05-05 15:39:01,wallstreetbets,IB and Think or swim.
2021-05-05 17:28:10,wallstreetbets,I like tits
2021-05-05 17:54:51,wallstreetbets,Can confirm they are updating their mobile app weekly for about two months mow
2021-05-05 18:14:33,wallstreetbets,I really like the Schwab mobile app. Way better than Vanguard or Fidelity. I thought Ally bank had the best but no confidence they will survive as an institution.
2021-05-05 19:11:51,wallstreetbets,Do you guys think it's too late to transfer from Robinhood? It takes about two weeks and you can't buy or sell your positions. I feel like there's a lot of development coming in the next week or so.
2021-05-05 01:53:22,wallstreetbets,This ish still shorted or na

2021-05-05 08:50:15,wallstreetbets,"Literally me. I sold at .31 because it had been resting there for a week or so, with the plan of transferring out of Robinhood and into another platform.

2021-05-05 07:22:02,wallstreetbets,Schwab and vanguard now. Lot of my friends and apes like fidelity. I just didn’t want to have to keep looking at 3 different brokerage accounts so moved all the RH to Schwab.
2021-05-05 10:22:00,wallstreetbets,"Schwab also comes with a checking account, you get a card and it has really awesome international withdrawal rates. That sold it for me as I love to travel and have had issues in the past with paying too much in fees to get at my money."
2021-05-05 07:18:30,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been consistently buying call options (about 2 weeks out) since their last earnings report in March. I think the moon is coming soon but realize it could take another month or so. I’ve won so of these battles and lost some since March but I much prefer buying ITM calls, rather than all the cheap at 800c. I hope some of these animals hit their 800c options but just a bit too risky even for me"
2021-05-05 15:02:45,wallstreetbets,"Bc they were the only ones with the capital to back it up outside of what the head of the 🐍was willing to risk. That's the part ppl are ignoring. It's like a pyramid, there's another cabal over and above the MMs"

2021-05-05 07:16:04,wallstreetbets,"I’ve had Schwab for a few years and like them. What I really liked about RH was the app. Only reason I didn’t do fidelity was because I’m already set up on schwab. I have 552 shares of GME on vanguard too, but their app sucks more than Schwab."
2021-05-05 08:45:51,wallstreetbets,You talking about their app? As a broker their probably my favorite…their streamlined HYIC and customer support are top notch too

Always has been"
2021-05-04 21:56:17,wallstreetbets,My opinion: Fidelity is among the best of brokers. They are also developing a more “user friendly” app due to an overwhelming number of requests
2021-05-04 22:54:14,wallstreetbets,"I’m on Schwab. They have Smartstreet Edge system
I use. Shows dark pool and has all the graphs and shit. Really good chat help also."
2021-05-05 00:02:46,wallstreetbets,"Schwab or Fidelity.

I like fidelity for most things but Schwab allows you to set any price you want for limit sells, while Fidelity limits it to 50% of current value.

For meme stocks Schwab is better for a buy, set limit sell, and forget."
2021-05-05 00:56:14,wallstreetbets,TDA/Schwab or Fidelity!
2021-05-05 08:34:49,wallstreetbets,I use the thinkorswim app (TD Ameritrade)
2021-05-05 05:08:25,wallstreetbets,Personally I think TDA & Fidelity are top notch
2021-05-05 13:05:23,wallstreetbets,The street smart interface over at Schwab is the BY FAR the most complete trading desk Ive ever had access to.
2021-05-05 16:08:52,wallstreetbets,"Just talked to Brian at Fidelity, dude was more chill than Jake from StateFarm.  UI is shit, but they got a new thing coming down the pipe, a decent amount of resources and good people behind them."

2021-05-05 13:41:51,wallstreetbets,"I was thinking about this - even if the squeeze never happens, this could still be a bargain of a price, especially looking a few years out.  They appear to be doing everything right to turn themselves around and be successful."
2021-05-05 14:13:36,wallstreetbets,"For schwab do you have to wait until the transfer settles to buy stocks or can you transfer funds, buy instantly, and then the transfer settles like RH?"
2021-05-05 07:45:12,wallstreetbets,no
2021-05-05 14:09:41,wallstreetbets,"They restricted the trading of GME back in January. They have some shotty automations in practice. For example of you pull pit of your IRA they try to get you to pay the fees for the total amount instead of the gains which is in accurate according to the law.

Also when you place a buy or sell limit order they will only execute it exactly where you put it at. In comparison Fidelity has on more than one occasion gotten me a better price because if they see it rising they'll sell for more, or dropping they'll buy for less.

Charles Schwab on mobile is really bad too, it freezes up all the time. It's just stuck in the boomer age."

2021-05-04 22:25:28,wallstreetbets,That’s good news.. I have them as well but it’s way more complicated for a amateur investor
2021-05-05 00:13:21,wallstreetbets,The desktop trader pro program is tits too.
2021-05-05 10:29:19,wallstreetbets,"be careful if going to fidelity,  and expecting them to cover your transfer fees.   I jumped ship  on the black day when RH suspended buying.  After reading on Fidelity's site they covered transfer fees.    Turns out,  due to the high volume of retards transferring they arbitrarily upped their base account value limits.   So... have to be transferring more than 25k     


ultimately not a big deal.   but my buddy that jumped ship to TD ameritrade... got his fee covered.   without any bullshit.     And TD  tends to already have a good interface,  and really helpful support."
2021-05-04 21:57:55,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the response!
2021-05-05 08:44:00,wallstreetbets,Their app is already plenty user friendly IMHO.  That is unless you want to use it to make childish memes on a stock and impress people on the internet.
2021-05-04 22:53:12,wallstreetbets,I can't wait for their new app!
2021-05-05 00:36:27,wallstreetbets,"You could also try Webull. The app has a nice UI and they allow after hours trading, but no otc stocks."
2021-05-05 12:13:01,wallstreetbets,"I'm a little late to ask this, but is Public considered a good app for stocks? I've heard it from other youtubers and such, so I started there."

2021-05-05 00:34:42,wallstreetbets,Of the two which has the better app? Do the they have after hours and OTC (if so who has the cheapest fees)?
2021-05-05 00:33:29,wallstreetbets,idk I have Schwab and they only let me do a little over $3k each right now for GME
2021-05-05 11:42:32,wallstreetbets,"100% agree the 50% sell limit is bothersome but, if you call the brokerage line, they can set a sell limit outside of the 50%"
2021-05-05 03:29:21,wallstreetbets,About $72k.
2021-05-05 16:31:09,wallstreetbets,I had to wait for the transfer to settle but it happened relatively quickly. I waited one business day on schwab
2021-05-05 13:54:07,wallstreetbets,The head of IB even went on CNBC saying that they stopped it from squeezing to infinity lol.. He looks/sounds exactly like who youd expect would be protecting the hedgies

2021-05-05 02:20:51,wallstreetbets,Webull is basically RH
2021-05-05 11:41:32,wallstreetbets,stay away from Webull
2021-05-05 01:59:00,wallstreetbets,Schwab has after hours and OTC. Don't know about fidelity.
2021-05-05 06:29:15,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity has [Extended Hours](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/active-investor/extended-hours-trading)  

Info on that same page regarding OTC:  

> At Fidelity, you can trade listed equities and OTC equities—excluding pink sheets and bulletin board stocks (i.e., those that are not listed on an exchange)—during extended hours. Whether you choose to trade during extended hours depends on your investing style, objectives, and tolerance for risk. If you’re focused on building a diversified portfolio of high-quality stocks, bonds, and other investments, and are not comfortable with the heightened risks involved, you might be better off executing trades during normal market hours."
2021-05-05 13:40:39,wallstreetbets,Fidelity is better. Schwab is the wannabe.
2021-05-05 00:58:34,wallstreetbets,Oh. I never tried a number that high so I wasn’t aware. But I still like schwab since you can do numbers much higher than fidelity.
2021-05-05 04:15:58,wallstreetbets,"Heheh, noticed that after. True true![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)"
2021-05-05 15:42:47,wallstreetbets,"Us retail investors aren't allowed to market manipulate.  


But if you're a big investor that screwed up your stop losses by setting it too sensitive when you have a big position, and then it starts selling prematurely with basic fluctuation, and then your automatic sell causes the next large holder to automatically sell, and then they sell, and then they sell, and then they sell, causing the stock to crash for no reason other than computers selling everything based on algorithms...  


Like that's fine they'll just halt trading and reset everything.  


But retail investors manually putting in their own orders with their fake money to cause their own speculation? No that's not cool. Can't have that. The short sellers are allowed to do what ever it is they want, the hedgies can do what ever they want and if they crash a market it's fine.  


But Finance forbid people fight back!"

This will interact with ihealth and share data that is collected on that app with your doctor. The only catch is that your doctor will have to adopt well healths Oscar EMR platform (and pay their recurring revenues) in order to have this option available to their clients/patients. The only app in Canada that interacts with the iPhone.  This will be a big driving force behind forcing clinics to adopt the Oscar EMR platform provides by well (one of the highest margin aspects of Well) and will likely lead to each of these clinics adopting other offerings by WELL as well. Huge news for well health and all Canadians as it will allow anyone to collect health data and share it with their doctor to improve health outcomes!!

BUT atm USA is still unable to default because we have 900 military baces all over earth fighting wars for JEWS. THIS is why USA sucks isrials cock because they OWN the USD."

2021-05-05 01:20:34,wallstreetbets,HOW CAN SHE SLAP
2021-05-05 09:05:39,wallstreetbets,That gun tho
2021-05-05 09:19:47,wallstreetbets,I loled
2021-05-05 09:40:45,wallstreetbets,"Came to mention it, glad I'm not the only one: Leslie Nielsen was great."
2021-05-05 03:50:49,wallstreetbets,"Even Cramer wanted in on the Yellen bashing, surprised he didn't make an appearance"
2021-05-05 02:43:07,wallstreetbets,Just give the man/woman their well deserved upvote and move along!
2021-05-05 07:33:18,wallstreetbets,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)
2021-05-05 09:19:49,wallstreetbets,Looks like I picked the wrong day to pray the 🌈away
2021-05-04 21:52:04,wallstreetbets,"*Scientifically proven* to be the funniest movie of all time.

https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-09-09/worlds-funniest-comedy-airplane-nets-most-laughs-minute

The move is Airplane! by the way. I highly recommend it to both of the WSB users who have the patience and reading ability to have made it to the end of this sentence."
2021-05-04 22:00:41,wallstreetbets,I saw it in the theater as a kid I laughed my fucking head off
2021-05-05 02:26:49,wallstreetbets,Please someone make a GME version of the scene where OJ boards the boat and totally annihilates himself (naked gun I think). OJ should be Kenny G in that scene.
2021-05-05 03:15:57,wallstreetbets,It's close but for me it's always going to be Blazing Saddles
2021-05-05 01:01:16,wallstreetbets,Surely you can't be serious?
2021-05-04 23:13:53,wallstreetbets,"What this movie called again? I remember watching it but I forgot the name!

Jk I remembered it. Movie is Airplane for any apes wondering."
2021-05-05 06:09:58,wallstreetbets,The woman with the gun kills it
2021-05-05 08:48:54,wallstreetbets,"I've seen this movie a lot but it wasn't till a few years ago watching it with wife that the jet plane was making prop plane noise. I lost because it was funny and how subtle the joke was that I missed it for at least two decades made it even funnier. So, every exterior shot had me cracking up."
2021-05-05 10:02:51,wallstreetbets,Top Secret! is another movie by the same people that I highly recommend if you like Airplane!/Naked Gun/Police Squad
2021-05-05 05:53:11,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, yeah, this film is fucking hilarious"
2021-05-05 08:02:47,wallstreetbets,In its day it was a completely different kind of move alltogether!
2021-05-05 09:43:01,wallstreetbets,My girlfriend has already determined that she isn't going to like it. It's the slapstick humor that she isn't fond of which I understand but even though this movie is slapstick the humor is so much better than that label lol. Still trying to talk her into watching it.
2021-05-05 06:47:33,wallstreetbets,Contender with Austin Powers for me.
2021-05-04 23:25:02,wallstreetbets,The only part of the movie I enjoyed as the random boobs near the beginning.
2021-05-05 00:03:42,wallstreetbets,Boomer Humor
2021-05-04 23:08:15,wallstreetbets,I kept hearing this and I didn't laugh once. Only got about 20 minutes in
2021-05-05 08:53:19,wallstreetbets,"I rented it on Amazon a few months ago, I didn't find it that funny, in fact I found it a little insulting and boring to say the least. It's just from another time I guess, like it might be too old for some people to connect with it."
2021-05-05 06:25:02,wallstreetbets,Pour one out for old WSB.
2021-05-04 23:20:22,wallstreetbets,Agreed 👍
2021-05-05 06:41:53,wallstreetbets,Janet yellen has been paid several hundred thousand dollars in speaking fees by citadel in case anyone has forgotten
2021-05-04 23:11:50,wallstreetbets,Maybe people prone to forgetfulness shouldn't be in positions of power...
2021-05-04 23:24:01,wallstreetbets,"she said the quite part out loud. 

she is Hagrid in the ops i wasn't supposed to tell you that."
2021-05-05 07:37:15,wallstreetbets,It isn’t a question of her mental sharpness. She was right and very lucid in her statement about inflation. She was likely berated by everyone in the administration after she made the comments and was provided with a quick mea culpa statement to back out of it.
2021-05-04 23:47:24,wallstreetbets,Good thing she only runs the Treasury.
2021-05-05 10:49:53,wallstreetbets,"I think it's one of those things where someone who has been an academic economist for an entire career is giving the correct answer.  Rates may, eventually, have to rise.  Not exactly a bold stand.

But when you are Chair of the Fed or Treasury Sec., people don't read the text of your speech like it was a conversation around the water cooler at the econ department, they read it like ""This is what's top of mind for the people with the power to do it.""

I honestly think a lot of economists who end up at Fed/Treasury forget that suddenly their words can define expectations for the U.S. economy."
2021-05-05 05:48:55,wallstreetbets,Anyone 70 or older should not be allowed in elected or appointed government positions. This generation near death shouldn't be able to dictate all of life for everyone else.
2021-05-05 05:18:50,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I wouldn’t want her cooking me a meal or performing surgery, nothing important like that. Nothing important like, oh I dunno, maybe being Secretary of the US Treasury. Nothing like that, of course not."
2021-05-05 07:01:06,wallstreetbets,Did she forget she doesn't work at the Fed anymore?
2021-05-05 10:08:03,wallstreetbets,"You uhh, do know those aren't mutually exclusive statements, right? Rates *may* rise, but that isn't what she predicts will happen"
2021-05-05 00:18:52,wallstreetbets,"Stock price inflation is massive. Bread and Netflix, not so much."
2021-05-05 00:55:17,wallstreetbets,"Inflation wouldn't be so bad, if they weren't ""predicting"" so much. Sometimes inflation can happen because everyone expects it to happen. She should really shut her mouth."
2021-05-05 01:58:56,wallstreetbets,Airplane!
2021-05-05 10:22:13,wallstreetbets,I envy you right now. You are in for a treat.
2021-05-05 08:01:51,wallstreetbets,You should definitely watch airplane. It's worth it
2021-05-05 02:04:01,wallstreetbets,"I don't think that's the only time they did an Airplane! reference. If you watch that movie now, you'll see alot of 'familiar' scenes and punchlines."
2021-05-04 23:12:53,wallstreetbets,Yellen is the new Keller
2021-05-05 02:40:09,wallstreetbets,Yellen is what Karen does
2021-05-05 08:36:41,wallstreetbets,Everyone knows it's fake but is looking for any sign to hop off the train before it explodes
2021-05-05 02:55:20,wallstreetbets,That's actually not a lot of bleeding when using a lightsaber
2021-05-05 02:31:10,wallstreetbets,"Remember when Trump would talk about interest rates and people would call for impeachment? 

Good times, good times."

2021-05-05 08:07:50,wallstreetbets,"You just said why the Fed shouldn’t exist.

If Yellen can’t specify proper interest rates, can the Fed board  do so which is just several people like Yellen?

Face it they are all a bunch of reckless people like Yellen."

2021-05-05 02:16:21,wallstreetbets,"I’ve worked with some amazing improv actors, and they always find a way to throw some button on their performance or reaction. Leslie was truly an ‘Actor’s Actor’.

2021-05-05 01:32:32,wallstreetbets,tldr on this comment?
2021-05-04 23:47:43,wallstreetbets,"Laughs per minute can’t be equated with being “the funniest”. There are comedies with the laughs being fewer and further between, but the quality of the laughs much greater. 

Airplane! is a great movie that has a lot of hilarious bits, but I don’t laugh anywhere nearly as hard as I laugh during an episode of Nathan For You or *Division 3: Football’s Finest*, even though there are fewer laughing moments in them. 

With regards to purely laughs per minute, I wish they tested Jackass 1 or 2, or maybe even a good stand up set against it."
2021-05-05 01:24:27,wallstreetbets,all two of them
2021-05-05 01:53:22,wallstreetbets,Theater? I barely know her

Airplane is good start to finish."

2021-05-05 01:00:32,wallstreetbets,I personally never got it either. Some parts are hilarious though

2021-05-05 07:27:37,wallstreetbets,So let's make the maximum age for president candidates and senators 70. We can't risk our country run by senile old men who still lives in the 1930s

2021-05-05 07:03:43,wallstreetbets,Can you explain it like I'm retarded?
2021-05-05 09:01:18,wallstreetbets,"That seems to be the obvious explanation.  She's not wrong, it's just no one wants to hear it mentioned so soon... the algo bots are listening and HF trading based on the comments."
2021-05-04 23:56:08,wallstreetbets,That’s where we keep the $$$ though. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)
2021-05-05 10:58:25,wallstreetbets,"Agree and very good point about academia. I had professors that understood things by the book and who could trach and inspire very well, but didint or couldnt do well in the business world. Its kind of like coaching and playing. Most great coaches afent or werent great players on the court.

2021-05-05 12:56:33,wallstreetbets,"Disagree. Yellen knows that the words of high ranking officials like the Fed Chairman and Treasury Secretary are parsed very carefully by many people, and can have immediate effect on the markets. In fact I would go so far as to say the Fed, at least, is fixated on the market. Treasury has other concerns, at least on paper, but the markets are all-important to them as well.

They may have a background in academia, but they don't get to stay in their positions by shooting off their mouths, no matter how old they are.

The 'raising rates' statement and subsequent backpedal are textbook jawboning."
2021-05-05 08:26:53,wallstreetbets,"Consider all sides of an argument? You kidding me?

2021-05-05 10:16:47,wallstreetbets,">  Last ten years Subway went from $5 footling to $6 6 inch subs

That's because their customer base has enough elasticity of demand to pull it off, it's pretty common with food (notice how dominos has become insanely expensive as well?  People ordering it don't care that much about price creep)

obviously inflation marches on over ten years time, but to say price increases are just inflation is silly"

2021-05-05 18:43:51,wallstreetbets,"I was just referring to how the government is holding the cost of basic consumer goods down, so that poor people don't feel the effects of the massive inflation happening right now.

2021-05-05 12:33:56,wallstreetbets,With a username like that I'm not surprised you're making such idiotic statements.
2021-05-05 04:46:37,wallstreetbets,The way the Fed's money printer works basically just inflates asset prices. It doesn't increase wages which is what is necessary for real inflation to happen. Remember QE was basically an experiment in response to 2008 (because apparently the lessons Japan learned didn't apply to us) and it did fuck-all for normal people.

2021-05-05 02:48:58,wallstreetbets,"List of movies I've laughed at like that: 

Austin Powers (the 1st one)

Tropic Thunder

Hangover

Superbad

Undercover Brother

Don't Be A Menace to Southcentral

Bad Santa 

Step Brothers

I'm sure there are a ton of others, but when i have to pause the movie because I'm laughing too hard, i know I'm in the midst of a classic. I've actually laughed incredibly hard watching Rush Hour 1, but i don't know if i could put it up there with those others. 

For me, Airplane belongs on that list (and for that matter, almost anything Leslie Nielsen has done). It's a forever comedy and i feel like it's the pinnacle of slapstick, dark humor, and goofiness all rolled into one. 

I get where the other commenter is coming from, but i also think a lot of people think Airplane! is a ridiculously funny movie."
2021-05-05 09:11:08,wallstreetbets,"I'm actually somewhat curious about the age group and demographics on airplane lovers. I found it to be pretty funny but a bit ""dated"" by the time I watched it (and already well exposed to modern comedy movies, youtubers, standups - Dave Chapelle is the one I grew up with, etc). However I at least ""got"" the humor. Many of my more fob east Asians friends found it to be *opposite* of funny. 

It isn't even the same country, I have Japanese, Korean, Chinese friends that came to the west somewhat later in life (not even super late, like anywhere between end of high school to undergraduates). Many of them hated watching it. But the more ""westernized"" counterparts seem to all enjoy airplane, tho not everyone loves it the way reddit seems to be. It isn't exactly just ""slapstick"" or dark humor either, as many of my Chinese peers literally grew up on Stephen Chow's shits. I wonder if it's the culture references or something."
2021-05-05 06:13:42,wallstreetbets,"There’s a lesson in the movie that applies today. The making of the I speak jive scene.

2021-05-05 12:44:50,wallstreetbets,"\^\^\^\^ This. Look at the number of times any governing body has issued a statement and then retracted it the next week, day, or hour. This happens all the time. Not only is it a tactic to gauge reactions, it also can work to change perceptions. Like saying ""we could raise rates"", (setting the market's expectations) and then subsequently ""no we won't raise rates"", (relieving those expectations) could tend to have a similar effect on the market as simply lowering rates. But there's a limit to how much they can actually lower rates, so they use every other tool in the box as well."

Wages need to stay high enough to support the economy otherwise money printing is the only way to keep stocks rising. But printing doesn't last forever, as it strips wealth from the many and gifts it all to the few. Then the many kill the few and take the wealth back by Marxism. Good times."

The point it all blows up on wages rising is when the current very efficient group of Tradesman who have done it for decades retirement rates hit tipping point - which is the next five years.  Replacement rate on them is greater than 1 for every 4 leaving depending on industry.  

Then, the wage suppression floodgates break, real wages go up, and the current generation finally have a shot if they managed to get their house loans before 2023."

That's awesome.  You belong in WSB. Such a retard."
2021-05-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PFE Boomer TLDR Bullish DD Yes I know its a boring drug company but hear me out. Skip to last paragraph for TLDR.

PFE reported today

1.) Beat earnings estimates. est 0.78, actual 0.93
2.) Beat Quarterly Sales est 13.6 Billion, actual 14.6 Billion
3.) RAISED Future Earnings forecast EPS $3.10 -$3.20 to $3.55 -$3.65

These three happened today, on a market down day. PFE was up, but only a little.

This stock will gain and gain for many years. Here's why I think you should at least look at one Boomer stock.

The Covid-19 Vaccine. Do not underestimate the entire World and this vaccine. Yes we are off to a good start in America but the rest of the World is way behind and in dire need of supply. PFE has shown great leadership in production and distribution along with there partner BioNtech. When you hear about vaccine you hear the Top 2 common names, for people who do want vaccine, would like to get, PFE or Moderna.

Why buy PFE now? They are posting RECORD sales and trading under 52 week high.

They are forecasted to continue making vaccine money well into 2022 and 2023 with multiple countries signing supply contracts. See Europe, Canada, America...

Booster shot is likely to cover variants. Which has potential to bring Additional income.

Not buying yet?

Pfizer has requested emergency approval for adolescents 12 - 15 year olds in America which has been reported to authorize very soon, also in Europe.  Not to mention they will be soon asking for all ages as soon as phase 3 studies completed and verified.... If people want 2022 school year uninterrupted it will most likely happen.

Still not with me?

Mrna is around to stay, Pfizer is in development of treatment for Covid-19 for active cases. Of which there is only one approved treatment. No, Not (Hydroxychloroquine) its Remdesivir. If they get a treatment for Covid-19 this could be another major catalyst. They are researching Mrna uses in many other areas now. Not just Covid-19. The CEO has recently said they will be in development for other uses.

PFE is trading below 52 week highs and under 5 year highs.

My position is small. I was able to convert one $37 C  5/21 and plan to hold my 100 shares as a Pandemic reminder. I still have four $37 C 5/21 which I plan to hold until PFE hits past its 5 year high which I believe will be coming soon.

There are Bearish cases... Do your own DD, this is not financial advice.

Still uncertain? Well if you held on this long. Pfizer ex-dividend is 5/6. So not only can you buy a stock thats just beat earnings, sales, future outlook. You can do something truly Boomer. EARN DIVIDENDS all on a company breaking sales records and trading under its PRE-PANDEMIC highs. Just take a look at this boomer stock. I plan on holding my shares and one day looking back at these crazy years. Just like I bought my 1 share of another stock that shall not be named.... you know what it is!"
2021-05-04 21:11:46,wallstreetbets,"u too late, bro. the right time to buy would've been after last earnings when it  dipped to around 33. Now, there's a lot of room on the downside than the potential upside"
2021-05-04 21:24:40,wallstreetbets,Sadly PFE never stays in the 40's for very long.  Always sell above $40 and buy back below $34.

2021-05-04 21:12:53,wallstreetbets,So pfe going to $46 ?
2021-05-04 21:13:24,wallstreetbets,Calls were stupid cheap today so I got a bunch of 5/21 40Cs
2021-05-04 21:42:18,wallstreetbets,I remember buy 40c's a year ago when they were the front runners for the vaccine. And then every month after and the before the fda approval. And nothing ever happens. Nothing will happen now. Its the most boomer bloated stock in the world.
2021-05-04 21:43:35,wallstreetbets,"I am with you...hold 44 calls out to Jan 2022...
Held threw this massive drop, seen a analysis a couple months back with a target of 63 will take time to get there but should be obtainable over the next 6 months..."
2021-05-05 16:28:08,wallstreetbets,"Wow what a crazy day...

All going awesome. Then the Biden Administration announcement of IP protections on Vaccine!

 Enter at your own risk. Who knows where this will go now. Still holding my stock because I still believe its easily a $45 stock. I might have to play both sides now....

Unreal.

UPDATE: Sold all my calls for May 21st except 1. Im probably going to buy puts to play potential downside now. News yesterday was not good with the Administration if they follow through.

Holding my 100 shares of stock... forever. As a reminder of 2020 - 2021"
2021-05-04 21:16:46,wallstreetbets,"I did. I've been holding 47 calls since then. But there is much more room for upside. Why are we below pre-pandemic prices on a company thats divesting of some  and acquiring new. 

I believe $45 and higher is well with in range. Calls are still cheap. After dip this morning I bought some $40 calls that expire"
2021-05-04 21:25:36,wallstreetbets,Yes! I agree. This is exactly why I bought in the first place. But i do believe we will hit 52 week highs first....
2021-05-04 21:55:01,wallstreetbets,Technically I'm Gen X. But the stock is definitely Boomer. To the Moon
2021-05-05 11:52:35,wallstreetbets,Ty bot
2021-05-04 21:17:41,wallstreetbets,I think higher. Some analysts have it at $45.
2021-05-05 00:43:12,wallstreetbets,Until the msm et al can no longer suppress how many ppl are dying from these experimental vaCcInEs.
2021-05-04 21:46:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. I had the same feeling. Im like WTF. Why in the heck is this so cheap. Literally its all you hear about on the news worldwide. Think about this at least...


You'll never forget the Name Pfizer."
2021-05-04 21:47:41,wallstreetbets,Agree. When it dips. Im sure it will. All stock do. I load up on some leaps.
2021-05-04 23:57:25,wallstreetbets,"Calls are always cheap for pfizer cause it moves so slow. I had calls back in the days sold them for a small profit. Moved too slow for my liking. I mean, it could go to 45, but also back to 35. Too risky for me to enter now, but good luck to you, man."
2021-05-04 21:18:28,wallstreetbets,Welp I’m late to this anyways lol those $37 calls expensive now
2021-05-05 07:39:04,wallstreetbets,Well its not really experimental since the technology has been around since sars. Im not here to convince u to take vaccine. As for people dying. Yes ive heard of some problems with other vaccines in blood clotting and rare death. You have extremly LESS odds of dying from vaccine THAN u do from taking ibuprofen. yes ibuprofen Kills... alot thats why there are warning labels on everything
2021-05-05 10:18:40,wallstreetbets,Agree with you. Gotta go where you feel comfortable.  RSI indicators a little dicey. But I believe this stock range is mid to upper 40's. $35 would be a HUGE buy opportunity
2021-05-04 21:20:12,wallstreetbets,I bought some 40's today when it dipped in morning. Look how cheap 40's and above are. The stock itself is a bargain.
2021-05-04 21:20:51,wallstreetbets,So I should look at $40 5/21 calls ?
2021-05-04 21:24:26,wallstreetbets,"Look at PFE 5 year chart. With earnings today, ex-dividend tomorrow. $40 for this IMO still bargain. Not financial advice, I just like the stock."
2021-05-04 21:25:26,wallstreetbets,I’m looking at that now hopefully it does not sky rocket tomorrow at open so I can grab some cheap $41 calls lol
2021-05-04 21:34:58,wallstreetbets,"Ive been beating the PFE drum since March, but nobody likes Boomer stocks. When i saw chart i was like... um this is easy choice. Im happy my measly 100 shares get dividend too. I literally converted one of my calls just to say I did... lol I YOLO my last $1800 in March into PFE. So far I'm over $5500. Im just smal potatoes"

Grey market in Canada was up and running years before it was legal here.

When I moved from BC (a part of Canada where it's assumed everyone smokes)to Ontario I walked around the sketchy part of downtown showing people my BC drivers license saying 'Look.. Im not a narc.. I just moved here and I'm looking to buy some weed.' and I ended up going on a multi hour long adventure with some high school kids that eventually yielded me a gram of ditch weed.

It was like being a kid again with all the shady meet ups and everyone acting all sketchy.

I live about 15 minutes from a lake and on the other side of that lake is where the reactor is.  The lake is big, but not great lakes scale.

It's far enough that I don't really feel threatened by it day to day.  Although, it's close enough that I know if it melted down it would probably give us cancer at best or kill me and my entire family over the course if a few days at worse.

Edit: there is also a coal power plant on this lake, and I feel more threatened by it as there has been many instances of coal ash running off into the lake.  There is a rare cancer that occurs in my area at alarming rates compared to the rest of the country.  My doctor keeps up with it and she told me they aren't sure if it is due to the power plants or the excess radon gas in the area."

2021-05-05 12:20:32,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity IRA you can pretty much use like a brokerage account but with all the tax benefits of an IRA in retirement. The amount of money you can make is entirely limited to your risk tolerance.  I am not a YOLO investor.  Instead, I buy good companies and hold them long term.  AMZN is just one of many and I made thousands of dollars last year off them.  If you invest in an ETF like ARKK, SPY, or VNQ you let some hedge fund make stock picks for you and you get an average return of like 5-8%.  That is better than nothing but buying and holding good companies with large growth is how you make real money.   But you have to do your own DD (due dilligence) to understand if that company is the right pick for you.  Rule #1 of investing.  If you dont know what to do, do nothing."

2021-05-05 15:48:35,wallstreetbets,"""Dude"", I'm looking at the chart and the data speaks for itself. The lows have been climbing every month since July 2020. In fact, if you do the math the average increase on the lows from month to month has been 55.19% (not yet accounting for May).

You can see this easily for yourself if you visit [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?period1=1588707805&period2=1620243805&interval=1mo&filter=history&frequency=1mo&includeAdjustedClose=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?period1=1588707805&period2=1620243805&interval=1mo&filter=history&frequency=1mo&includeAdjustedClose=true) and look at the ""lows"" column.

I don't need to care about the highs or even a price target as long as I see higher lows. I will hold as long as that continues to happen."

2021-05-05 03:37:23,wallstreetbets,Earnings are always priced in before. Never hold through an earnings date. Good or bad it only goes down.

2021-05-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Full YOLO Low Risk High Reward $MOS Play No One has Cared About **The Mosaic Company**

Its quite shocking to me no one has been talking about mosaic. With the rise of Corn and Soybean prices back to 2008 levels and grocery prices going up again, I think its my duty to bring attention to what I believe to be one of the biggest opportunities to cash in some massive gains. 

Lets go back to 2007-2008: 

>**How it begins....**  
Alright Retards, Lets go over a quick lesson on ""Supply and Demand."" When demand for food rises but supply holds constant, the price rises. How do the producers react? well these mofos see high prices for a commodity, and they react in their economic self-interest.   
>  
>**SO WHY DOES THIS MATTER I WANT TENDIES!**  
>  
>This self interest comes in the form of leasing, buying and farming as much damn land as they can to keep up and milk it all. ""**Monsanto** (NYSE:MON) enjoys a seller's market in *Incredible Hulk*\-brand mutant seeds""(motley fool). Mosaic Bag holders continue to snort coke and celebrate with hookers as farmers try to maximize yields on these seeds by buying more fertilizer.  
>  
>**How it all went to the moon**  
>  
>Farmers notice an unintended side effect of chasing yield: While they've been rolling in fertilizer, the price was reaching new highs! Potash and potassium futures started chugging along and guess what happened next.....farmers raise their prices to compensate for the higher input costs. SHEEESH!  
>  
>**AND THEN THE DAMN GROCERY SHOPPING PRICES WENT UP AND AUNT JEMIMA BECAME A LUXURY!**  
>  
>Companies like **General Mills** (NYSE:GIS) feels pinched as the wheat it needs to make its Wheaties continues to rise in cost, while **Coca-Cola** (NYSE:KO) notices a disconcerting rise in the cost of high-fructose corn syrup and your grocery bill is now more expensive than the boob job your South American mistress wants. Stock Goes Up and Rock hard like when you find the perfect video on PH and hits a staggering $143.00 per share (fuckkkkk daddy)

**Fast Forward to today....**

As of 05/04/2021 Corn closes at 7.45, Grocery prices are starting to make the wallet feel more pinched and Daddy Powell and Yellen Cant give us a clear idea of whether inflation will continue to stay low or if Biden's budget plan suggests us to raise rates and prepare for inflation. Go check out the demand and price of fertilizer in 2021........... 

There is unusual order flow of over 90,000 Open interest OTM calls for June 18th, 2021 with a $40 strike and a stock sitting at $34.39. Last time a bushel was over $7 the stock price was between $77-$110.

&#x200B;

This is not financial advice and may be the rambling of a madman. I am just a retard trying to raise enough capital to buy some ""entertainment"" in Thailand for 2 years and live in a straw hut."
2021-05-05 00:26:30,wallstreetbets,"You realize that a cartel was fixing global phosphate prices in 2007/2008 and that it has since collapsed?

Here:
https://www.istat.it/storage/icas2016/c16-gnutzmann.pdf

I genuinely hope this works out for you guys but this is a high stakes gamble.  Not to mention that this company has been exempt from treating their hazardous phosphogypsum waste as hazardous under the Bevel exemption which is now being considered for repeal in Congress following the dam issue at Piney Point."
2021-05-04 22:08:21,wallstreetbets,"I’m bullish. Bought 100 shares before they had earnings and bought some more when it tanked a bit after earnings. Had really strong volume climbing back today, fertilizer demand is climbing (China be going corn crazy), and the order flow for June 18th is looking noice."
2021-05-05 11:20:01,wallstreetbets,"As a grain elevator employee and seed salesman, as well as amateur stock retard, this one really piquied my interest."
2021-05-05 11:32:04,wallstreetbets,"Was a couple recent DDs about them, last week I think"
2021-05-04 21:13:00,wallstreetbets,Mosaic is sitting close to it's 5 year high right now. This boat was definitely missed
2021-05-04 21:38:13,wallstreetbets,I feel like this makes sense but not enough to YOLO idk
2021-05-04 22:13:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah my calls are crying.  June 40c.  It's had a crazy run up.  Hope it can leg it out to 40.
2021-05-05 03:04:36,wallstreetbets,"How exactly is this low risk/high reward?

It’s up over 100% since November and there hasn’t been a catalyst for this since major phosphate price manipulation caused a food crisis in 08"
2021-05-04 20:13:22,wallstreetbets,China green agriculture (CGA) is another play on fertilizer prices. Its a shitty company but its a microcap so it runs faster than MOS with a little volume
2021-05-05 09:59:24,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for adding your source. This is the exact constructive criticism I am lookin for to gauge more insight on the play.  

History does repeat itself and we are seeing those early signs and might possibly be not before long until someone comes in and abuses and takes advantage the same way they did in 07-08. 

Again, Highly unlikely but at this point the whole market is speculation now."
2021-05-04 22:16:15,wallstreetbets,"As did I, they were god damn expensive too!"
2021-05-04 21:12:45,wallstreetbets,"I saw your edit but just to be clear: mosaic does cut huge swaths in the earth to mine potash. They are also a reasonably good employer. (I once lived in an area where they were opening a potash mine and the number of people I knew getting good paying jobs was high). It was a significant boost to the nearby city's economy.

So I would say they are only half bad. Since they do, you know, drill giant huge holes in the ground and build roads through the forests and put up fences around giant compounds that were, before, very peaceful natural areas.

I still bought calls because they're going to do that whether or not my calls print. I am but a tiny grain of sand in the desert after all."
2021-05-05 12:32:34,wallstreetbets,Interesting Indeed! Im sizing up on this dip
2021-05-05 03:40:40,wallstreetbets,Since when is that an argument.
2021-05-05 09:45:05,wallstreetbets,This is how I've been thinking of all of these posts lately. It's more fun to just put in your own favorite ticker wherever you see theirs and pretend the whole post is about your favorite stock. I just wish I could read.
2021-05-05 11:09:06,wallstreetbets,"No problem.  I've worked in this industry for about 10 years - on the environmental/by-product side of the business.  I remember driving down Highway 60 in Florida to Mosaic when their stock went bust - it was literally the day the cartel broke up.  Nutrien is the other player in the phosphate space.  They have phosphate plants in the northern part of Florida, North Carolina, along the Idaho/Wyoming border.

The other thing I will mention is that a couple of fairly sizable phosphate plants have closed since the industry tanked.  The PCS Nitrogen Plant City facility in Florida was purchased by Mosaic and subsequnetly closed due to poor profitability about 2 years ago.  The Nutrien/Agrium plant in Redwater, AB was switched to ammonium sulfate production about a year ago.  That may help your thesis as supply in North America has been reduced.  That said, the international component is a big piece of the puzzle and I cannot speak to that.  Hope this helps."

2021-05-04 20:24:11,wallstreetbets,I had to be extremely patient with these because both contracts went down to 50% before coming back. I had to hold the bag over the weekend for the ones that expired yesterday going against my rule of cutting loses at 20%. It was a judgement call where I got lucky.
2021-05-04 23:06:19,wallstreetbets,f

2021-05-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"McDonalds Stock I've been wondering why McDonalds stock doesn't get more love. I don't hear or read much about it in any of the forums. They offer what I call a ""recession resistant"" product (i.e. Dollar Menu), 2.21% dividend yield, & they're one of the largest real estate owners in the world. They've been around forever and have had great growth over the last 3 years. Despite the country becoming more health conscious.  

&#x200B;

Personally, I like that stock a lot better for a long term buy and hold than say, Coca-Cola 

&#x200B;

Thoughts?"

2021-05-04 22:17:04,wallstreetbets,"Bada bappa baaaa,  that company sucks.
Large chains with slop for food can't win new customers,  they rely on idiots like me who work through their lunch and don't plan for real nutrition. Love the ease of use, but demographically they are dead. Nobody is playing in the ball pits and there's zero smoke coming from their restaurants. Does McDonald's smell like McDonald's anymore? No it's all microwaved and fried. Their market isn't sustainable long term years from now.... also they love replacing people with machines . Fuck that. Subway was beating the shit out of them and now franchisee owners of subway are  bashing subway for freshness. The rebranding of MCD Is also toast. 
Not very inviting for kids,  which is what drove them into real success. Ronald took a big nap i guess"

2021-05-04 20:59:49,wallstreetbets,I've been tracking ARCOS for this particular reason. I am bullish on McDonald's. The beyond meats deal was just a cherry on top.

2021-05-05 14:50:02,wallstreetbets,That's not how McDonald's makes money. They're a real estate company that advertises with food.
2021-05-05 03:12:53,wallstreetbets,"I actually like the whole ice cream machine situation.

I think it shows that there might be greasy and fraudulent business happening behind the scenes. Since the American ethos has been built on greasy and fraudulent business models and America is the greatest economy in the world, I don't see how the ice cream fiasco can go wrong.

As well, as a side note, I think your mindset is where most retail investors fall. Right now is an opportunity to buy low, once those ice cream machines start working again the stock will go to the moon and you will be too late."

2021-05-05 00:50:55,wallstreetbets,"It won't let me view the sub. Do I need an invite? I would love to post my spicy chicken recipe. Warning: brining takes minimum 2 hours for breasts cutlets. Do start early. Bun is by preference but I like a soft French bread. Or brioche. Or pretzel. You do you. The important part is the chicken. You infuse it with flavor at every step. Brine is literally just that leftover jalapeño juice with extra salt and cayenne. I'm not sure how to make the jalapeño stuff bc I don't can my own jalapeños. Leave in fridge, covered 2 hours. While that's matriculating blend the following spices: 
1 Tbs garlic powder 
2 Tbs smoked paprika 
1/2 Tbs chili powder 
1 tsp cayenne 
1 Tbs black pepper 
Blend well and when the chicken is finished brining, pat dry with paper towels and rub with the spice mixture. Then flour (yep, add some salt and pepper to that) egg wash, and bread crumbs with black and red pepper and maybe a little paprika. Make sure your oil is good and hot, (at least 375°F) and carefully slide the chicken breasts into the hot oil. Be careful not to crowd the pan you may have to do it in batches. Cook until internal temperature is at least 160°F and dress the way you want. Seriously, I could probably just eat the chicken. Oh just regular garlic aolii but now you've got me thinking about the possibilities of remoulade."
2021-05-05 10:14:55,wallstreetbets,That's church's fried chicken. I'm not gangster enough to go after their turf. Lol.

2021-05-05 15:56:50,wallstreetbets,Except their purchased calls would offset any gains they made from IV
2021-05-04 21:33:37,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-04 21:04:23,wallstreetbets,"I would say you’re in a good position to make money between now and Friday. When the volume goes away is your indication to get out, unless you’re in it for the long haul."
2021-05-05 14:14:54,wallstreetbets,"Mine was sos, I only bought 2 for $9 ea the very next day I peaked and I sold the options I sold em for $100 ea. I was like fuck yea this option thing is where it’s at. Last week was the last bit of my options for the most part, everything’s been .01 for weeks now"
2021-05-05 14:14:40,wallstreetbets,"This happened to me on a much smaller scale. First ever Call was SHLL Sep 18 2020 $50, ended up making 45% return in 2 days. Told my brother in laws how easy it was making money and could already envision my lambo. Bought some random no DD call (NBIX) and promptly lost 50%. Decided that was a fluke so tried another with FMCI Oct 16 2020 $7.0 Call and lost 64%.  Basically lost all my initial gains and then some.

Now I just stick to selling covered calls on a stonk I've been bag holding on since 2008 (which also fucked me and I took a few steps backwards when it went on a great run a few months ago, and I was locked into $4 calls when it ran almost to $6.  My b/e was $4.80 😒.  Had to buy back my initial Calls for 3x what I initially made, then sold more $5 calls that ended up expiring worthless thank God)."
2021-05-05 15:27:27,wallstreetbets,"Here’s a question...I have 100 GME at 209, should I sell them for rocket shares and then buy them back at the end of the week?"
2021-05-05 15:32:13,wallstreetbets,"You'd be hit with a wash sale in that case, so if you want to be on the GME train you gotta hodl. I'd say see what happens in the next 2 days and evaluate which one has more potential."

The other day I was watching a space movie on netflix and noticed the compression artifacts in the deep blacks so today at walmart I impulsively picked up a 3 Bluray movies from the $6 bin and watched one tonight. 4k uncompressed is a magnificent thing and I honestly didn't realize I was missing out on so much quality. So I'm starting a physical movie collection now and can't wait to buy more movies. I'm not saying I'm proof of op's claim, but I sure think there will be a market for physical copies in the future.

Also for the record, when it comes to games. I always buy the physical copy when I can. Maybe it's just habit, but I like being able to sell them when I want and not having to worry about accounts etc."
2021-05-04 20:21:18,wallstreetbets,Why not both? There are tons of reports about how movie theaters are one of the things people miss the most. Amc can be both a solid investment opportunity AND a ploy to keep us away from our sweet gme

2021-05-04 20:29:08,wallstreetbets,"I said “I could keep going”.  As far as readiness squeeze, AMC is in a better situation. Think GME before the baby squeeze. Both companies are shorted by the same HFs. Regardless of comparison, if one squeezes, there will be a domino effect. HFs are currently trying to stave GME because it’s harder to enter IE lower volume. We can flank them exploiting a weak angle which is AMC.   *Ape together strong*

Every company literally has shorts. A squeeze needs a reason for shorts to exit, and all exit at the same time. Holy shit that is not AMC. If there is ever a short play to look at, it's shorting AMC and waiting for everyone to see the fucking light."

What I am trying to explain is that AMC MIGHT be in a better squeeze scenario, but it needs something to push the shares up high, something that makes investors excited. AMC has nothing, GME has it all.

I think AMC will squeeze because shorters are not going to have capital for covering at low price, but its not a SAFE bet and def not going to be as big"

2021-05-04 22:08:50,wallstreetbets,"Difference is, there are 351 million (78% of float) loyal movie goers, with family and friends, that will go to each one of those movie titles. 😎"
2021-05-04 22:21:27,wallstreetbets,You think every single share is owned by one person? So more than half the population of the united states owns a share of AMC and they are ALL going to go to AMC to help increase share price?
2021-05-04 22:40:17,wallstreetbets,"Obviously not half of the country. Roughly about 40% if you include family and friends. And yes. This will increase profit short term, and lead to significant changes in the very near future."
2021-05-05 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NIO After Earnings, Analysis, and Valuation I'm late because I wanted to get some feedback from my colleagues about NIO.

  

**Facts from the Report** – **Revenue** & **EPS**

**NIO** reported results for the 2021 1st quarter and full year, ending 3/31 with:

* Revenue $1.22 Billion (+481.8% YoY), beat my expectations by 3% (4 million) (market expect 1.02, beat by 18%)
* Vehicle Revenue 1.13 Billion (+489.8% YoY), beat my expectation by 3% (3 million) 
* Subscription and Other Sales 88 million (+395.3% YoY), beat my expectation by 8% (6.77 million)
* Per Vehicle Revenue between 56.34, beat my expectation by 3%
* **Adj Diluted EPS: $(0.48)**
* **Excluding SBC** and accretion of redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value**, Adj Diluted EPS $(0.04)**
* Beat my expectation (0.08) by (0.04) 69%
* Beat market expectation (0.16) by (0.12) 139%
* **Gross Margin: 19.5%,** beat my expectations by 13% (230 bps)
* Vehicle Margin 21.2%, (+135% YoY, +19% QoQ) 

  

**Q2 Management Outlook and My Immediate Predictions**

* **Vehicle Deliveries: 21000-22000 (management)**
* \+103-113% YoY, +5-10% QoQ
* **Total Revenues: 1.243-1.298 Billion (management)**
* \+119-128.7% YoY, +2.1-6.5% QoQ
* **Gross Margin, Vehicle Margin: 20%, 20%**
* My Q2 SBC-Adj Diluted EPS: **$(0.02) ± 0.01**
* \+167.4-277.26% YoY, +34.13-143.99% QoQ 

**Key Takeaways from Earnings Call**

Following a strong earnings report, management highlighted multiple short-term headwinds impacting NIO’s growth. The current chip shortage will retard vehicle production and deliveries in Q2. With weekly checks on the spot price of the auto chips, do not expect continued vehicle margin improvements in Q2. In fact, I choreograph for a small decline in vehicle margin in Q2, contingent on the chip situation.

The positive tailwinds for NIO are concentrated in the second half of 2021, as the chip situation ameliorates. Multiple long-term partnerships, including Metro AG and Sinopec infrastructure agreements and the NeoPark project, will improve margins for both vehicle and subscription services. NIO will likely continue to outperform luxury brands, including Audi, BMW, and Mercedes in the Chinese market, enjoying the combination of branding, cost, and continued EV subsidies. Taken together, NIO will continue its triple-digit improvements in revenue and high double-digit earnings growth. 

Through this, we realize that the determining factor in NIO's success is no longer a question of vehicle sales or production. Following in TSLA's footsteps, with the blessing of the government in swap-tech, and with a clear market niche in the mind of management simplifies our job considerably. In fact, during the earnings call, William *explicitly* remarks that (paraphrasing) ""The NIO brand will not be for the mass market.""

This significantly improves our valuation metrics and margin assumptions going forward. Away from the mass-market razor-thin margin, I began with Ferrari (NYSE: RACE) as a template for long-term COGS and Margin assumptions. **NIO isn't Ferrari, it will never be, I did not just copy-paste margin assumptions.** Ferrari's COGS is stable around 47-52% of revenue, SG&A at 10.5-9 long term, and R&D at \~20%. My assumptions for NIO go a bit lower, proxying for competitor brands like Benz, BMW, and Audi; therefore, COGS trends towards 65-60%, SG&A toward 10-9.5%, and R&D around the same. The argument for COGS not being higher is management guidance for high-take rates involving subscription services. Management has emphasized NIO not just being a car company, but also a service/lifestyle company (""We intend to directly our gains from the margin towards better products, better tech, and better service""). 

This is the core issue currently at the heart of NIO, and I encourage you all to discuss and find out the future: ***It's not selling vehicles, it's building swap stations.***

**Valuation, short, mid, and long-term**

In the short term, noting NIO's presence in a highly competitive market, with a past history of uncertainty, we assign a Terminal EPS of 20 and a discount rate of 10%, giving us a valuation of $50.85 fair price and appreciation potential of 33.96%.

In the midterm, we expect NIO's EU expansion, Swap station deals, and chip issues all to be resolved, Quoting Graham/Dodd, ""we disregard negative earnings as a quantitative measure of financial health, and only use it as a qualitative measure of company performance."" NIO has made significant improvements in EPS, and will likely continue to do so.  Altering the probability weighing of our Bull, Bear, and Base cases to favor strong performance in Luxury EV markets also justifies a higher Terminal EPS valuation and a lower risk. At 28x terminal EPS, 55:30:15 Bull:Base:Bear distribution, and 9.5% discount rate, we have a mid-term appreciation potential of 95.78%

***Long term***

Long term, I strongly believe in the viability of BaaS, ADaaS, and the superiority of battery swapping in high-density urban sprawl markets; Tesla has its place in countries with similar suburban housing as the US, but markets in Pan-Asia and EU, with poor access to personal charging options, are better suited for battery swapping. In the future, NIO may support both Supercharging and Swap capabilities, lowering downtime overall; in either case, NIO's unique presentation and positioning (NIO houses lol) will ensure strong brand stickiness and continuously improving margins (from services) as take-rate improves. Therefore, with a terminal EPS multiplier of 35 and discount rate of 9%, we have an appreciation potential of 151.54% and a 3-5 year target price of $160.

2021-05-04 22:39:19,wallstreetbets,Ya'll are missing a major point. It's a all out cock match between the US and China over world dominance of EV's and technology. You think this Sinopec deal happened out of the blue? My guess is the CEO received a late night phone call from the communist party to make this happen. They have the full backing of the Chinese government so let that soak in for a minute.

2021-05-05 10:57:15,wallstreetbets,"I've been long since 2018. Avg cost $4.69. I sell OTM covered calls every week. My personal thesis on them is that they will dethrone Lexus as the asian luxury SUV powerhouse, simply because Lexus/Toyota are so far behind on EVs it's not even funny. They are so hellbent on churning out hybrids and hydrogen cars that they are falling behind on the true direction the car market is headed"
2021-05-04 21:21:35,wallstreetbets,"Battery swaps are a doomed experiment from a car guys perspective. Thats why Tesla abandoned the idea so quickly. The cost, and logistical footprint necessary for a volume battery swap station would be enormous. How much would people really be willing to pay for such a service ? I have a hard time seeing any reasonable price that could come close to covering the cost involved.  Next comes the mechanical downside of repeated assembly, disassembly of major car components. Screws, bolts, connectors. These things will fail, and present liability exposure to the changing stations. Thats without even getting into the fire potential of a damaged or questionable pack, with hard use, lots of miles. And maybe a worn out connector, or even physical damage from the swap itself. That goes unnoticed.  Changing 1500 lb battery packs carrying 800 volts of juice is not a simple , fast procedure. In all honesty,  the 30 minute 80% charge that most electric cars can now achieve pretty much invalidates the entire concept."
2021-05-04 22:38:23,wallstreetbets,I also think 40-50 is the right valuation at the moment for nio. It’s well priced for a run coming positive eps
2021-05-05 11:28:47,wallstreetbets,"Well laid out. Short Term Factor is when CATL new 100 KWh increased capacity comes online. By my calculation NEO makes additional RMB 41,000 selling 100 kWh versus 70 kWh Battery. So additional 5,000 of those batteries in a month can add RMB 200 Million in Profits. If you get that boost in Q2 2021 the Gross Margins in Q2 will be approx. 25%"
2021-05-05 11:29:41,wallstreetbets,Can you explain why you were so close to the numbers & ALL NIO Analysts were so wrong
2021-05-05 11:40:24,wallstreetbets,"On you GM scenario. 70 kWh Battery was priced at RMB 1000 per kWh. Battery Price went down & NIO priced new 100 kWh Battery Higher. So in my estimation making additional RMB41,000 Profit per 100 kWh Battery. So surely selling an extra 100 kWh Battery in Q2 Vs Q1 will be multifold times more impactful per EV than any rise in Chip Prices. So if they could get an extra 5,000 100 kWh Batteries then Q2 will be RMB 200 Million better in Profits than Q1"

2021-05-05 14:24:03,wallstreetbets,"Other than being willing to get down and dirty with the evidence, engaging with the company and the users, and picking through the weeds, I like to add three extra steps in considering my analysis:

1. How does NIO fit in the bigger picture of China moving up the value chain?
2. Why are my assumptions full of shit?
3. Why are the institutions full of shit?"
2021-05-05 10:05:47,wallstreetbets,"Don’t forget other pros.

1. Swappable batteries make it easy to replace in the event a cell or two goes bad in the battery pack.  

2. Should battery technology improve, it would be theoretically possible to retrofit new battery tech to old vehicles."
2021-05-04 20:51:56,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the thorough answer.  I haven't studied the company extensively, so the main part of the question was how many battery types will they need to support?  I believe they currently have 3, with plans for a fourth (solid state?), and they're still early days.  I'm not technical enough to understand if this continued evolution will create complexities.  Any thoughts?  Do all three current fit the same footprint?  I.e. could they just decide to stop supporting their lowest kwh battery to introduce their new generation?  Or would that drop support for certain models?

Do they develop their own batteries?  How would you describe their battery positioning; mid cost better than average performance?  I guess BYD is a major competitor in both EVs and batteries, how do you think the two stack up?

Totally agree on ad space, be it movies, makeup, mortgages, or concessions.  Very easy to interface with the car and promote an in swap station purchase, so they can generate some ancillary revenue.

Swapping for sure is faster currently, not sure if/when solid state is reached if that will become as much of a factor.  Lowering the car cost at current prices by making the battery a subscription seems to make sense provided the subscription rate is competitive with or lower than the added lease/finance cost.

China is mega dense in many areas, so this model works well there.  Europe, a little less so, but still fairly dense, so this could work.  It would be much more difficult in North or South America or most of Russia."
2021-05-05 11:24:58,wallstreetbets,"Great Summary!! BaaS lowers the perceived cost Bravo. On 100 kWh Battery at RMB 128,000 NIO is making a killing. ADaaS So nice of NIO not to charge you RMB 20,000. There are so nice they only charge you RMB 680 MONTHLY which works out to RMB50,000. Again lowering Perceived Cost & charging more. Pure Marketing Genius. CCP RMB 18,000 subsidy which no other Premium Brands gets does not hurt either"
2021-05-04 20:13:57,wallstreetbets,"Because by the time Tesla considered it they had already invested hundreds of millions in the infrastructure of super-chargers, regular stations, app etc. No way Elon was going to write all that off.

NIO swap stations are MASSIVELY successful for a reason (they've done over 100,000 swaps). How can you say it doesnt work better than a charging station when you can pull in and leave in under five minutees fully charged? Is there a charger that can do that? Now with the Sinopec partnership (largest gas station chain in China, there will be thousands of more locations coming."
2021-05-04 21:28:42,wallstreetbets,"North America is too geographically separated.  At the time, Tesla didn't have even close to the numbers to justify swap stations across say North Dakota.

I would wager charging stations are far less capital intensive as well.  At times Tesla was on the verge of going bust as people didn't believe.  They've now proofed out electric as viable for many usages, pushed the technology along, and derisked a lot of cases.

Tesla next generation batteries will be a part of the structure, which has some advantages.  Until charging speeds come up and prices for batteries come down, jury is out.  I would argue a standard size/architecture needs to be agreed upon before we can call swapping a success.  I think creating a standard will prove challenging.  You can buy AA batteries which fit and work in so many different applications, but some might last an hour in an electrical device, and some might last two, depending on brand, and number of previous cycles.  If I'm paying x per month for unlimited batteries, I'm going to be pissed if I get the 1 hour version.  How would you manage quality control?

If solid state can be released for a reasonable price with super fast charge times, game over.  I happen to think this is a decade away. Converting battery swap stations to charge stations wouldn't be expensive."
2021-05-04 22:39:00,wallstreetbets,Well done
2021-05-05 14:41:15,wallstreetbets,"1. CCP is clearly supporting Hefei / Anhui to spend Billions. CCP is way ahead of NIO Analysts
2. Your assumptions were dead on in Q1
3. ALL Analysts were way off base -- Even now how can a ""good"" analyst like Edison Yu estimate 2022 NIO EV Sales of 140,000 when I am looking for 500,000 Sales for ET7 in the 12 months after launch similar to BMW numbers. So Analysts for sure are full of Shit
4. Another Question -- Is there any way we can find out when CATL will increase 100 kWh Battery Production, I am guessing, with new 1 or 2 Production Lines. Also 100 kWh Production Lines will be critical for ET7 Sales
5. Any chance that NIO Under Promising so they can over deliver on ET7 Launch Date -- Lucky to have some one like you on the Board Thanks"

2021-05-04 21:33:55,wallstreetbets,"No problem. I'm not sure if this is the place for an in-depth discussion about NIO power solutions, but if I am to call myself a buy-side analyst for NIO (and I do), then I must at least resemble a subject-matter expert. 

NIO Power, according to product descriptions and management comments, is an end-to-end integration of power-as-a-service. Aside from the 1st and 2nd generation swapping stations that we are familiar with, NIO Power also includes home-charging infrastructure, NIO charging stations, Power Mobile service, and integrated power map. 

Along with currently developing a solid-state battery, NIO offers a 70kWh battery option and a 100 kWh battery option. With Power Home and Power Home+, the respective charging times for the 70 and 100 options are {7,2.5}, {10,3.5}. Comparatively speaking, the charging times are roughly approximate to tesla home charging. 

NIO charging stations are the smallest charging stations. and charges from 20% to 80% in 30 minutes. Comparing to the supercharger, this is marginally worse. 

NIO Power Mobile service is one of the key differentiators. With power mobile, you are able to access charging/swapping solutions in places with no charging infrastructure. This is superior to Tesla's reliance on strict supercharging stations, especially in countries and regions with poor charging infrastructure or electrification issues (Russia, Western China, Eastern Europe, etc)

**But most importantly, how does this make sense financially?**

*In two ways.*

First, for existing users. Those who have purchased their 'battery', for exceeding their plan allocation, generate revenue. Those who have purchased a car and a battery subscription plan also generate revenue. This is directly mentioned and can be broken down as some function of vehicle sales.

For used NIO cars, buyers ***do not own the battery***. Like Tesla's Autonomous Driving subscription for 2ndhand buyers, NIO generates a revenue stream from these people. Unlike Tesla, NIO has both BaaS and ADaaS. *This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!*

**Thus, the conclusion**

NIO service and battery positioning are very good. Focus on accessibility and strong differentiation. Opens new revenue streams. BYD is a mass market, the wrong niche."
2021-05-05 00:24:27,wallstreetbets,"Was mainly basing it off of people saying that there is no room for charging stations in China (even though you it seems like you should be able to have them in parking lots), and I just didn't see how battery changing stations would work if you didn't have room for charging stations (assuming they take up more space).

Also it's easy to brag about 5 minutes, but how would that work out if it's in a really busy area/during the busiest hours of the day?

5 mins per person?

Are they going to have 10 battery swap stations next to each other?

Good luck getting your battery swapped within 5 mins when there are 5 people in front of you. Charging overnight or while you are at work sounds better to me.

Then again I have done very little research on NIO since I mostly own TSLA stock. I'd rather put my money into something different. Just thought about the battery swap and doubt how it could be better than charging stations due to the reasons listed above."
2021-05-05 00:35:35,wallstreetbets,"If the swap stations only accept NIO/approved brands it seems like the 1 hour battery shouldn't happen. I do wonder what would happen if a battery took some damage. Do you just toss it and lose money? Whose responsible for the wear and tear of a battery that has been in several vehicles?

Also converting the swap stations into charging stations may be more expensive then you think. Here is a video of a battery swapping station just one week old. Imagine tearing that whole thing down to make charging stations: https://youtu.be/Hp-K6xuQdCY

Interesting thing about the video is he did say that you can charge your vehicle or swap the battery. That makes a lot more sense to me. Maybe the swap stations could be more useful then I previously thought. Still seems like a charging station for overnight/while you work would be better. For workers they could charge while on lunch break (I don't live in China nor do I know much about China I'm assuming they have lunch breaks/some sort of break). 

Makes me wonder why people care so much about battery swap when talking about NIO (every NIO invest mentions it as a reason for investing in NIO) even in the video the guy said some of the people behind him will have to wait for probably an hour to swap their battery this could be fixed with more stations, but these stations aren't tiny."
2021-05-05 17:13:31,wallstreetbets,"1. It's about time China developed an actual car brand
2. I missed Subscription Sales by 8% in case you didn't notice
3. It's difficult to keep a constantly fresh perspective after years in the industry. everyone is going to have that issue. 
4. I would say to pay close attention to management guidance and remarks from NIO and CATL. Nothing is solid yet. Certainly, Nikkei [published an article](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/EV-battery-giant-CATL-to-boost-capacity-with-4.5bn-investment) in February about CATL's $4.5 Billion investment in increasing capacity.  
5. ***Order backlog is the 2nd derivative of actual delivery numbers.*** That's all I'm going to say about this. NIO doesn't provide order backlog breakdowns, but they do provide month-to-month delivery breakdowns. There's some complex math required, but I think someone can manage it."
2021-05-05 10:08:17,wallstreetbets,Idk what this means. Batterypilled?
2021-05-05 09:27:10,wallstreetbets,"Your core question is: What is the efficacy of charging stations compared to swap stations in China?

First, with a 5 min swap, a 30-min supercharging station will require 6 spaces to compete with a swap station. With NIO's integrated Power Map service, users are given updates and directed towards less crowded swap stations, reducing overall concentration.

Then you talk about the alternative, ""Charging overnight or while you are at work sounds better to me. "" It's valid in the US, where garage charging is viable and common. In contrast, with high-density urban apartments and European streetside parking, these options are usually unavailable. With the higher density, charging is more similar to getting gas than charging while you sleep. For example, if you commute to work in a city center in an electric vehicle, you would not expect charging station integration with existing multi-level car parks. 

With these factors in mind, NIO's battery swapping investments and services are better suited towards high-density urban markets like Europe and Asia. Living in America often puts us in our own bubble; we must realize that the vast majority of the world doesn't have amenities like a garage, backyard, etc."

I think it's important to start with facts before forming our own opinions. I certainly see value in Tesla as a company, and I am a big fan of Elon. One of the key parts of being a successful analyst is being able to keep an open mind and putting yourself in other people's shoes.

Certainly, our assumptions for the future are formed from our opinions of the company. But we are adjusting trends and forecasting the future; that all begins by having a strong understanding of the current realities of the company."

* Revenue and Earnings Beat
* Net sales rose 3% year-over-year to €5.08 billion ($6.2 billion), beating the FactSet consensus for sales of €4.75 billion. The sales beat was driven by growth in Nokia’s mobile networks unit — due to strong sales of 5G equipment — and its network infrastructure segment.
* Citi analysts expected the “very strong” revenue and operating profit beat to drive significant upgrades to 2021 consensus forecasts. They noted that while the guidance remains unchanged, management said the first quarter provides a solid base for hitting the higher end of its 7% to 10% operating margin range. They maintained a neutral rating on the stock with a target price of €3.55.
* NOK's 5G segment gains traction Nokia has been working globally to deploy its 5G solutions. The company was recently determined to have the most number of essential 5G patents of any operator by independent analysts at PA Consulting.
* 5G mobile networks services expected to increase 5-8 percent by end of 2023.
* Restructuring plan that prioritized mobile networks – including 5G – along with wired infrastructure (fiber), cloud and network services, and Nokia technologies.
* NOK is deploying a 5G network in the UAE in conjunction with Etisalat, a major telecom operator in the emerging markets sector. Partnering with Telefonica Spain to help deploy 5G service to Spain's residents by upgrading the telecom's IP network.
* NOK will work with NewCore Wireless to use the Tribal Educational Broadband Service (EBS) to deploy wireless broadband connectivity – including 5G – to rural and underserved Native American communities.
* New MIMO radios coming soon Dish Network is going to be using NOK's NetGuard solution for their cloud native open RAN 5G wireless network
