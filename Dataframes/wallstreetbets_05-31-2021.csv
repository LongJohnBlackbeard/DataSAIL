2021-05-31 19:20:23,wallstreetbets,He started shorting Tesla back in December while Tesla was at $900. My friend he won already.
2021-05-31 19:13:24,wallstreetbets,If its anything like his gme position he sold it for a profit already and left a fortune on the table.
2021-05-31 19:09:13,wallstreetbets,You’re basing this assuming he still holds any of those positions. I highly doubt it. He probably moved out of them the week after everyone saw what he was up to.
2021-05-31 19:12:11,wallstreetbets,Tesla has never made money off of selling cars or selling anything for that matter lol they make there money off tax credits from the government for being “green”
2021-05-31 19:05:35,wallstreetbets,Priced in
2021-05-31 19:55:49,wallstreetbets,Burry is going to end up like Einhorn with his Tesla shorts 🩳
2021-05-31 19:24:55,wallstreetbets,"I'd argue that he is absolutely holding those puts still. Based only on the fact that he told everyone shit was rekt leading up to 2008 and everyone was like ""lol no way"" and after shit hit the outboard motor, the country gave a collective shocked pikachu face."
2021-05-31 19:22:37,wallstreetbets,To be technical they make money off their competitors who need those credits
2021-05-31 19:23:20,wallstreetbets,"Lol I stand corrected, they make money off selling credits"

2021-05-31 19:43:38,wallstreetbets,What salary
2021-05-31 19:29:27,wallstreetbets,I had $2400 to put into AMC on Friday when it was trading for $22 a share.  I could have bought a hundred shares but I bought seven june 11 calls $31 strike @ $3.25 and sold them 45 minutes later for $6.54!  turned my $2279 gamble into $4573 in under an hour.  I wish I could do that every day.  But then my wife would probably dump her boyfriend and wanna hang with me all the time.  fuck that! [http://imgur.com/a/uGxACqP](http://imgur.com/a/uGxACqP)
2021-05-31 18:48:20,wallstreetbets,I need to figure out options.  I'm pretty good at just losing regular money on stonks.
2021-05-31 18:29:34,wallstreetbets,Holding 8 of those 40s
2021-05-31 18:21:04,wallstreetbets,I bought $33p when it hit $35 for 6/11. Sold 3/4 of it for +25%. Held the rest over the weekend.
2021-05-31 17:57:07,wallstreetbets,\^ Just a little description. I had 30 15 strike options expiring in June that I've sold off most of because I'm a paper handed bitch. Also Elon can suck my nuts.

2021-05-31 19:47:25,wallstreetbets,"If you’re good at losing money on stocks just wait until you dive into options. You see the benefit of buying shares is that you only lose when you sell. Options are a ticking time bomb constantly on the verge of detonation (and often do). To consistently make gains on options you have to do genuine DD and recognize entry and exit points before shit goes sideways. Did I forget to mention that on top of all of that there’s also like 30 other factors that play into as well, have fun learning the Greeks lmao"
2021-05-31 19:53:12,wallstreetbets,"Have 108 of those 40’s and I was up 100k when the priced surge, could’ve sold but 🤷🏾‍♂️ that would just be stupid"

2021-05-31 18:24:12,wallstreetbets,Good read on that. I sold the majority of my calls when it went down to about 31 mid day.

2021-05-31 17:56:50,wallstreetbets,I dont know why people here are losing sight of this train of thought. It isn't a ticker competition.

I’m not smart enuff to predict the housing market, but I think it bodes well for $Z as I think more are going for sale by owner? I also think they will be the leader no matter the market. They have so much data that I didn’t even address."
2021-05-31 18:40:44,wallstreetbets,There is no bubble in the housing market. There are 75 million millienials and at some point in the 2020's every single one will be in their thirties. That means children. That means new household formation. Builders/developers have built at 10% the historical rate for the last 14 years and there is a tremendous housing shortage and even if they built at 2004-2006 levels it would still take 5+ years to reach equilibrium. Also resale market doesn't help because everyone that sales a house has to buy a new one.
2021-05-31 18:00:56,wallstreetbets,Thanks brother and couldn’t agree more. Try to do a decent DD and if it isn’t certain tickers it just gets downvoted into oblivion. Oh well. Thanks for the award as well ✌️

I didnt buy it at 9 a 3st  time because my TA said it would go to 2.  

I was half right. It went to 20.  Its gonna go 30-40 this week. I know because im out if it.

NAKD has more to go. Which dispels the conventional thing that you retards only fool with options. Im not in that either.

2021-05-31 19:23:27,wallstreetbets,"Currently AMD. Amd has become the king of single threaded performance which is king for gaming. They’ve also been dominating multi threaded but this is known. The only reason to buy intel right now is last gen sales. That being said Alder Lake will come out later this year, and it is going to make some serious waves. It’ll be their first implementation of their 10 nm node into the desktop space, and said 10 nm mode has made big waves with Intel’s tiger lake mobile chips. Along with this Intel’s XE DG2 GPU’s will be coming Q1 of 2022 and those will be superbly exciting as well. Expected performance will be in between a 3070 and 3080, but what’s important is it should be priced very aggressively, and availability should be high, as Intel has a lot of power with supply chains and have easier means of getting availability than AMD or NVIDIA. That being said both are relevant companies that will be around for awhile. 


TLDR: buy and hold INTC and AMD 💎🙌🏻"

I did the same with AMC. I watched it bounce back and forth and decided to sell my 100 at $19 and it jumps to 30ish.  All cause I wanted to collect some short gains and buy more at the dip. Except when I sold, it never dipped. 

I bet this was the real trigger for your gains!"

2021-05-31 16:44:26,wallstreetbets,I overheard BB's therapy session while I was waiting in the hallway today for my appointment. I think BB is thinking of rebranding back to R.I.M.
2021-05-31 17:43:38,wallstreetbets,Any calls u think are good?
2021-05-31 16:22:53,wallstreetbets,How was the price action today?

2021-05-31 14:57:36,wallstreetbets,I think it’s funny how the meme number for BB is a much more reasonable target. Gme is 42069.69 or 69420.69 and AMC is 100k.

Now who is the king of cell phones now?  I get their business model has changed into other industries.  But what makes you think BB should be worth 420 because of automated cars?  Tesla don't use BB right?  Tesla don't even have fully automated cars.  Where can I buy an automated car?

Based upon what? What working product do they actually have? I'm not talking maybe and might have. Like what do they produce right now.

Until it's been made or completed, it's phantomware.

Their shitty outdated phones is the only thing they have at the moment. Company is worth dick."

2021-05-31 15:19:42,wallstreetbets,"It's not the ""automated cars"" bit, it's the OS/data-gathering + cybersecurity mix.

140 is optimistic IMO (I'm planning around a target of 50-80 for 2023), but there is a solid base for it, and being a software-focused company in times of inflation is something that would help too, from everything I've read/understood (minimal infrastructure cost compared to companies doing hardware, or commodities).

Something something not a financial analyst"
2021-05-31 16:07:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah it does assume that - which is why it's kind of useless. I think it's a cool idea if you can somehow work that part out though.

2021-05-31 19:29:09,wallstreetbets,My mistake I was looking at an older reference. Still when you think about it you realize how much bigger the US is compared to Canada in population.
2021-05-31 19:44:55,wallstreetbets,"Dude, that shows how little you know about $BB. They haven't been making phones for years. If you are going to say company is worth dick because they have outdated phones, have the decency to do some research first.

I'll just point out a few of the reasons:

QNX: the most secure and #1 automotive embedded OS used in over 175MM vehicles today, medical systems, droids and many other connected devices. Automakers using QNX: GM, Hyundai, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick, Chrysler, Porsche, Skoda, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Bentley, Holden, Land Rover, BMW, Mini, Honda, Acura, Nissan, Ford, Mercedes, Saab ,Xpeng, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Toyota, Jeep, Volkswagen, Audi, Kia, Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Fiat, Lexus, Jaguar, [Plus.AI](https://Plus.AI), Peterbilt, Subary, Byton, Peugeot, LUCID, Daimler, FCA, NIO, SsangYong, Suzuki, Chery, Volvo, Scania, Baidu, Nvidia, Intel and more. This list is only for the auto industry. There are many other companies and OEMs using QNX.

If you are referring to IVY when you say phantomware. Although it isn't  launched yet, it's been in development for years in partnership with Amazon, they have design wins with 23 of the 25 EV companies already and if you look at page 13 of the following deck ([https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/pdfviewer?file=/content/dam/bbcomv4/blackberry-com/en/company/investors/BBAS-2021-Presentations.pdf](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/pdfviewer?file=/content/dam/bbcomv4/blackberry-com/en/company/investors/BBAS-2021-Presentations.pdf)),  you'll see a preview of companies that are already integrating with IVY. IVY will also bring recurring monthly revenue as opposed to the one time license fee that QNX generates. Chen has also indicated that IVY will evolve into supporting smart cities.

I would recommend that you actually read through the entire deck. 

What other products do they have in market today? How about:

* Blackberry Alert - critical event management
* Blackberry protect - Endpoint protection
* Blackberry Persona - Behaviour and risk analytics
* Blackberry Optics - thread detection & response
* Blackberry Gateway - network security and analytics
* BlackBerry UEM - Endpoint control and management

Each and every one of those offerings are wort researching but I'll let you do that if you are even interested in $BB. 

$BB are leaders when it comes to patents owned relating to AI/ML Cyber Security with 63% of patents. Next up is Carbon black with only 26% of patents. Crowdstrike only has 11%.

$BB has government security certifications that no one else has obtained. (ex: NSA, CSfC, DoDIN and FedRAMP)

All 7 of the G7 Governments and 18 of the G20 governments are blackberry customers and I'm not talking about phones here.

They've been focusing on transformation for the last 8 years (which CEO John Chen is renowned for doing).

Now they are ready for growth and are starting to market their products. 

Watch this video from this year's Needham virtual technology & media conference to hear Tom Eacobacci's insight into how they will market their products [https://youtu.be/Ik7hYuH8sS4](https://youtu.be/Ik7hYuH8sS4)

These are only a few reasons why their future looks bright. You don't have to search much to find details on other factors like the Facebook settlement, patent sale for mobile related patents they no longer need, recent partnerships, IVY fund... ... ...

Still think they are worth Dick? Reason why they are so undervalued is because people still think they make cell phones and fail to see the potential. To be honest, that is great news for us bulls because if everyone realized what $BB is up to, we wouldn't have the opportunity to buy it at these low prices. I guess I should say thank you?"

2021-05-31 17:10:39,wallstreetbets,"Actually although a consistent growth of 74% for 10 years may be a bit much (not by much imo), but his opex projections are EXTREMELY conservative, nullifying the implication of yours that the 1.8B in profit in 2030 alone or any of the net income estimations are unlikely to happen or its estimation fanciful.  
  
here is your proof -  
  
  
  
He is projecting 65% CAGR for OPEX with a 25% CAGR for additional costs  
  
Bionano's CFO, ""opex is going to be up in this year. I don't think it's going to be staggering. I'd say somewhere in the 20% to 40% range this year. And then I would probably keep it in that range for the next couple of years' growth, that range.""  
  
Also an analyst recently projected a similar DCF model and he had additional costs at a flat 0% rate, so that tells you how conservative Ragnaros' actually is.  
  
Also CFO has said numerous times that 2021 YOY revenue growth will be 'substantial double digit growth' and factor in nanonozzle and their 'global saphyr adoption' goals plus the fact thatCMA, FISH, KT are all absolutely dogshit compared to Saphyr IF you actually know the tech-cost effective, less hands on time, faster turnaround time, AND easier to learn and use. PLUS LOH and SNV detection is in the works according to managment. AND $100 PER GENOME is coming soon. We also have a saphyr 2.0 with a 14x higher throughput and nanonozzle which is essentially confirmed (imo)  
  
  
  
Please ask any other questions but before I suggest you read or watch the >101 page DD I have done on BNGO.  
  
If I seem a bit pissed in my reaction that is because I am, typically when Bionanians start posting to other subs the misinformation is crazy and this time is no different. No disrespect but be careful in the future with effectuating the fallacy of composition my friend."
2021-05-31 14:44:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Genome industry is just starting. BNGO is almost the main player in the optical mapping business. As per ARK's 2021 Big Ideas, long read genome industry is expected to increase at 82 annually from 2020 - 2025. Maybe slow down a little from there and hence my 74% CAGR.

2021-05-31 17:44:17,wallstreetbets,Because when you get to the bottom of it it’s a company that hasn’t made a single penny and need the stars to align for another 7-10 years to be profitable. Any number of things can happen in that time.  All estimates are also based on forward projections.

2021-05-31 16:45:16,wallstreetbets,"No it is because fundamentally if the Saphyr is as good as the >500 white papers and publications and studies and doctors claim, there is NO reason why Saphyr should not be in all 2,500 cytogenetic labs replacing all CMA, FISH, and KT methods because of its cheaper cost, higher accuracy, faster time, and ease of use and learning to use.

2021-05-31 14:56:03,wallstreetbets,Not trying to shit on you by any means.  Just wanted to point out how difficult it is for any business to grow like that.  You may also want to consider another DCF with another round of dilution and possibly higher interest rates.
2021-05-31 16:48:13,wallstreetbets,Have you looked at the total addressable market for Saphyr?  It's really not all that big and doesn't support anywhere close to a 69% sustained CAGR.  Also I don't see tax being included - it is going to boost numbers in loss years and give a big hit in the profitable years
2021-05-31 15:04:52,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha. This number is the main factor determining the price target though, so if it's off by even a modest amount, none of the other details or precision in the model really matter. I like to find a comparable company that's a few years ahead of the one I'm looking at and place my target company on that growth timeline, just to anchor to reality a bit more."
2021-05-31 17:47:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's what I am seeing. I agree, if everything goes well it will be worth more in years. But no one seems to have an answer for what is changing in the near future that will make it rocket."
2021-05-31 16:47:35,wallstreetbets,suck on my nanonozzle you gy bitch
2021-05-31 16:43:12,wallstreetbets,"Most of my investments are long...when I listened to the last CC and they projected doubling their units and the revenue was 7m, I decided it was time to cut the rest of the position.  A company with 7m revenue and a 14m projection for 2021 doesn't equate to a multi-billion market cap, regardless of their tech 🤷‍♂️"
2021-05-31 15:39:12,wallstreetbets,"More dilution and offerings are unlikely, 350M in cash rn and CFO believes its cash stockpile “significantly de-risks the company, solidifies our financial future, and allows us to focus on the achievement of our long-term vision to disrupt genomics through the global adoption of Saphyr.”

I can rant on more if u like but even if CAGR decreases a bit we are still going to 20-100x revenue down the line.

Also remember the flywheel and learning curve effects."
2021-05-31 16:15:51,wallstreetbets,"On the other hand, if you read the very bottom of my analysis, I have also given a scenario of another $350M of dilution. This would result in a price of $16.7/share."
2021-05-31 14:59:01,wallstreetbets,"Taking all feedback positively. I will for sure updating my model. :) As I said at the very start of my analysis, this is a quick and top of my head version of DCF.   


My sole purpose of this exercise is to show that the current price of $6.17 is not justified. I believe BNGO is worth at least $14 as suggested by top analysts on Tip Ranks."
2021-05-31 18:31:56,wallstreetbets,"Total addressable market is way more than we know. Humans, animals, agriculture!! 
I do agree with your tax comment. I haven’t added it into my calculation. I have gotten a lot of nice feedback. I will soon be doing another round of DCF :)"
2021-05-31 15:46:24,wallstreetbets,"That's fair to be skeptical, but it is hard to find a comparison. Technically speaking, looking at ILMN at it's inception is the closest to a comparison you can get, but it's not really the same. Both came in with a genome technology that changed how genomics were understood. I would look at ILMN and expect about a 50% to 70% relative growth rate. It's very rough, yes, but I don't know of anything else to adequately capture it's relative market. Knowing people that work in genomics labs and having a wife that has a PhD in BioChemistry that also spent time in a genomics lab, the real world workers all believe that it not only could be huge, but is bigger than people outside the actual labs think. These labs have to complete prior contracts to make big moves with it first, though, due to monetary constraints and obligations."

2021-05-31 13:35:31,wallstreetbets,AMD is vastly improving their cpu+gpu chips in a market where mid level video cards alone cost more than a console.  They are an outstanding pick for casual gamers/workstations.
2021-05-31 12:56:08,wallstreetbets,I've been annoyed that the past few ramps into the mid and upper 90s haven't held.  The products seem strong to me and they're building momentum rather than taking a victory lap.  Disclosure:  I'm holding AMD.
2021-05-31 12:11:07,wallstreetbets,I like this news!
2021-05-31 13:48:34,wallstreetbets,Let’s go AMD!!!
2021-05-31 16:28:09,wallstreetbets,$AMD has great moon potential post-merger (which should happen before EOY). I'm balls deep in LEAPs.
2021-05-31 16:55:38,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I’m reading this thread and it has some retarded comments like “no way they catch intel”, “i hear they almost good as intel”, and similar shit.

This, ladies and gentlemen, is the performance chart of top CPUs available: 
[High end CPU benchmarks](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html)

Try to find Intel on it? I will help you, there is no Intel in first 15 products. AMD is so way ahead that its consumer grade cpus are killing 5000$ intel server grade cpus.

Intel is laying down on the floor and the judge is counting if it can continue to fight or go to hospital.

Currently AMD has superior products for servers, PCs and laptops. Situation was reversed until last few years, but now? AMD is below 100$ because of merger plays 😁

Buy AMD, hold for a year. 50%+ upside.

Next fighter is probably not patched Intel cpu, it is one of ARM’s boys like Apple M1 successor, or some others you haven’t yet heard for cause it stuff for nerds."

2021-05-31 14:53:53,wallstreetbets,I was going to buy Nvidia for the share split and brought AMD instead. Super dumb. No regrets.

2021-05-31 13:23:16,wallstreetbets,I did exactly this and it's the reason I first looked into AMD - the components are brilliant! From what I've read many of the CPUs perform better than the Intel Core I9 on single core speed (which matters most to gamers - a huge market!)

2021-05-31 17:58:33,wallstreetbets,"I’d step out past 1/1/22 on strikes.  

When a company buys out another company, there is a mathematically viable arbitrage between shorting the buyer to purchase the acquired company.   Essentially, someone can buy Xillinix with the revenue from AMD without having to be concerned about a squeeze provided the deal goes through.  That will keep the lid on prices until the deal either goes through or fails.  That will be as late as December.

I wouldn’t try the arbitrage, its easy to screw up and its very capital intensive.  Just be aware the price will be suppressed until its over and realize options will need to be far our on expiration, and buying is discounted vs. long term real market value."

2021-05-31 15:20:05,wallstreetbets,"Idk about now but there was a reason Intel was superior a decade ago. AMD had reasonable Chips but their performance was not through superior architecture, just the way they processed data. And it'd show on high broad benchmarking tests. Again, that was a decade ago I'm going to assume they've at least caught up to Intel chips pre- 2015. I'd be surprised if they were anywhere near 2019 Intel level manufacturing. 

Still a good alternative and component. There is a reason they've always been slower and cheaper but could be competent with Intel.

Now it doesn't matter as much if you sell most your shit to miners because you can tweak the chips to be specifically good at that one thing and not worry about performance across the board. 

Both solid companies. Intel being waaaay further ahead in R&D and manufacturing. Few new plants opening in Arizona"

you're completely backwards.  amd shat on intel so hard that intel's relegated itself to the 'budget brand' and actually beats amd on price: perf for the low end - at least for consumer.  regarding server, epyc obliterates xeon both in performance and price: perf

amd absolutely obliterates intel on sheer performance."
2021-05-31 18:18:43,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I'd still venture Intel is further ahead but that gap is probably closing until someone finds a material to disperse heat better.

2021-05-31 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A quick glance at Vzio  

Vizio is an American company founded in Orange County California in 2002. It focuses on producing smart televisions, sound bars, and accessories.It also operates Platform+ that comprises SmartCast, a Smart TV operating system, enabling a fully integrated home entertainment solution, and data intelligence and services products through Inscape. Its SmartCast delivers content and applications through an easy-to-use interface, as well as supports streaming apps and hosts its free ad-supported video app, WatchFree, as well as VIZIO Free Channels. In addition, the company provides support for third-party voice platforms.

Sector: Consumer Goods/Electronics

Vizio went public 03/25/2021 at 21$ since then it ranged from $17.25-$28.80 and currently sits at $21.84.

Market cap of $4B with 2020 sales of $2.04B and a P/E ratio of 40.

Net revenue increased 52% year over year to $505.7 million. With a forecasted annual earnings increase of 46.9%

Vizio has no debt compared to 5 years ago when its debt to equity ratio was 89.4%.

Short term assets ($750.8M) exceed its short term liabilities ($523.4M).

Gross profit increased 82% year over year to $86.7 million 

Net income declined 64% year over year to $3.3 million. (Vizio attributes this to problems with importing goods during the pandemic)   

SmartCast Active Accounts grew 57% year over year to 13.4 million

Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased 76% year over year to $14.52

Platform+ net revenue increased 120% year over year to $52.2 million 

One potential issue is Smartcast is only 3 years old and is not as well known as Roku, Amazon firestick or apple tv. People could opt for what the know rather than give smartcast a shot.

Vizio has strong financials and is focusing more on the ad revenue generated by smartcast. I don’t have much stake in Vizio but I do see potential. With some volume this stock can move."
2021-05-31 11:54:52,wallstreetbets,"*glances over at perfectly running 12 year old Vizio monitor*
Can confirm. Build quality exceeds expectations."
2021-05-31 11:59:09,wallstreetbets,My vizio still up I’m running and it’s the older brick looking model not the slim ones like you youngins got now a days lol
2021-05-31 11:47:09,wallstreetbets,"I agree with this !specially the last statement: ""this stock can move"" my prediction is that we will see the graph moving to the right but dont quote me on that, Im not a financial advisor"
2021-05-31 11:56:52,wallstreetbets,I literally looked over at my Vizio as well and said YEP!
2021-05-31 14:38:36,wallstreetbets,"I think a big over-looked aspect of Vizio's growth forecast is the mainstream acceptance soundbars have been gaining each year.

Vizio has, by far, the best cost to quality Atmos soundbars out there. As TV speakers get worse and worse, and soundbars get more and more popular, I believe Vizio will continue to capture a higher percentage of this market."
2021-05-31 12:52:28,wallstreetbets,"I was looking for a TV for the garage and picked up a 65” Vizio for $440, heck of a deal and heck of a TV. Kinda wondering why I spent 2,500 on the living room TV now."
2021-05-31 11:46:40,wallstreetbets,Username checks out
2021-05-31 12:01:07,wallstreetbets,"Why is their net income only around 4x3.3=13.2 million? What the fuck.

Revenue of more than 2 billion but net income 13 million?"
2021-05-31 13:04:18,wallstreetbets,"My Vizio 32"" TV from black friday 2008 is still running strong."
2021-05-31 12:04:35,wallstreetbets,I personally only buy vizio tvs for the quality. I bought my first 46in 12yrs ago and its still works great and upgraded to 65in last yr and have never been happier.  I will be scooping up some more shares very soon.
2021-05-31 12:34:34,wallstreetbets,"First flat screen my family got was a Vizio back in 06. I’ve always been surprised at how much better of a value they are than all
of the other brands. I’m still a Samsung guy now though, just personal preference. This would be a good long term buy."
2021-05-31 13:21:57,wallstreetbets,"Holding 100 shares and a few Dec $25 options. I think this one's going to move pretty well, even with the small drops it's one of the only IPO's recently that held it's value and trended up."
2021-05-31 15:29:41,wallstreetbets,I bought vizio TVs for conference room computer graphics for my boss in 2008. Can confirm they have outlasted any other brand he has had me buy for the other conference rooms when he expanded. Great product.
2021-05-31 16:06:30,wallstreetbets,I bought and sold this three times based on stimulus news and made money. Welfare plus cheap tvs equals profits.
2021-05-31 14:43:44,wallstreetbets,"As far as TV's go Vizios ares shit. I have three, and everyone of them have issues. First off the OS is shit or needs a bigger processor. The apps lag severely and often get stuck making me have to restart three TV. Occasionally Netflix or Hulu won't load, that requires a hard reset.

I had one in perfect condition quit working, I took apart and the board with all the inputs went bad. You can't get parts for 4 year old Vizios. Only used if you're lucky. What else? The TVs turn themselves off  in the middle of a show. 📉

My TV rating 1/20
Stock Rating ?

Only Samsung TV's for me. I had an old Samsung CRT TV from the early 90's and it still worked like new."
2021-05-31 13:58:32,wallstreetbets,Makes sense. Everybody has a big ass tv. Drake alone probably has contributed at least $1mil to that net revenue number.
2021-05-31 17:29:50,wallstreetbets,"I gotta say I agree with u/ODCTD. I know my experience with Vizio TVs is purely anecdotal, but I think Roku makes a much better product. I purchased a new Vizio TV this past October for $300. The only app that runs smoothly is Netflix, but it will still sometimes freeze and require a reset. All of the other apps are incredibly laggy, especially prime video. It’s completely unusable. I ended up buying chromecast because it was so unbearable. The TV itself is good quality, but Vizio’s UI has major issues. You can buy a Roku tv for cheaper, and you won’t need to spend the extra $$ for a chromecast or Apple TV add-on."
2021-05-31 14:16:26,wallstreetbets,"I like it.
They still need to do a lot of work but I can see them being that annoying competitor.

I have no idea what will happen short term though but I am in.

No way this is a sure bet but it can also pay off quite nicely over time.

It needs some big news or partnerships."
2021-05-31 18:03:02,wallstreetbets,I have two
2021-05-31 12:27:04,wallstreetbets,"It looks like their operating expenses increased from 37m to 72.9m. I'm thinking a big part of that will be r&d. 
Their adjusted EBITDA rose 218% from 12.7m to 40.4m so it's not really a cash flow problem."
2021-05-31 16:22:54,wallstreetbets,There's definitely money to be had. I think with their focus on the streaming side of things their earnings in August should bode well for investors
2021-05-31 19:02:59,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense.

I know they have a 100 man new engineering center in Denver focused on Smartcast.

I have no doubt priority #1  is making that experience smoother and better.

I have no doubt some people will have issues.

Overall, I can see some interesting potential.

Short term this is rock and roll risky!
But I'm in.

We'll see what happens!

Either my biggest mistake or my luckiest ""good"" choice."
2021-05-31 14:17:58,wallstreetbets,"Already a partnership with Verizon, I'm sure there's more in the works"
2021-05-31 14:44:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I liked that.
Watched a whole hour of a presentation yesterday.

Was great, not too much bullcrap just an actual  plan and already a lot of stuff in the works.

I love that they have gone a little unoticed.

I would love to be the early bird on this."

So if you are falling to the right move your hips to the left, and ""row backwards"" on the left side."

2021-05-31 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SHOP: the biggest Canadian market cap is the biggest fraud. 
This is not a gay bearish opinion. SHOP wouldn’t  be a bad stock if their financial statements were not a completely forged lie.

So, get in the ride and let me explain you, fellow ape, how you can make a 300x return by buying 150 put options when price is >1200.

Our main resource will be Shopify annual report 2020 (hereafter - AR) presented on the website of Shopify:
https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/40-F.pdf
I will refer to pages of it as AR p.xxx

Revenue

Let’s start with revenue. 2 of 3 bln. is coming from merchant solutions. If you do the math from AR p.157 you will realize that 1.5 billion of Revenue is coming from Shopify payments. It is 50% of year revenue. Shopify recognizes revenue from Shopify payments as a principle. I don’t believe this figure for several reasons.

1) (AR p.101) In audit opinion it is stated that revenue recognition (Principal Vs Agent) was a subject to both management and audit judgement. If auditors were sure about correctness of revenue recognition, they wouldn’t mention it.

2) If you review contract terms (section 5) between Stripe, who is processing payments for Shopify, you will see that the whole responsibility and control over payments is on Stripe. In this case Stripe is a principle.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000119312515129273/d863202dex1011.htm

3) If you look at the balance sheet (AR p.102) and note 10 (AR p.122) Shopify simply doesn’t have assets (Property, plant and equipment) to process payments, It literally has no infrastructure. You can’t tell me that 9.3 mln. worth computer equipment can generate 3 bln. revenue for a company with >5000 workers.

4) WIX, competitor of SHOPIFY, has similar number of live websites but has 10 times less revenue from merchant solutions (they call it business) than SHOPIFY.
Financial statements of WIX are:
https://sec.report/Document/0001178913-21-001179/
Usage statistics:
https://trends.builtwith.com/shop/Shopify
https://trends.builtwith.com/shop/Wix-Stores
 
5) Despite have that Shopify claims that they have more sales than WIX, the deferred revenue balance of SHOPIFY is less than WIX’s. Maybe WIX is receiving fees more in advance than SHOPIFY, but SHOPIFY has a ratio of amount of deferred revenue to revenue equal to 1 to 27. Meaning that it asks to pay fees more often than every 2 weeks. This is very unlikely since the standard period is minimum one month. The thing is that even the absolute number is lower than WIX, not just percentage.

Sales and marketing costs.

1) Since I don’t believe in revenue figure, I will refer to gross profit (AR p.103). It is 1.5 bln. For this gross profit SHOPIFY spends 602 mln. on sales and marketing. That means one dollar spent on ads gives only 2.56 dollars of gross profit.  This number is very low and indicates that SHOPIFY is not such a good or mass product. Reminder, company exists for 17 years.

2) I see ads that say Shopify can make you 30 mln. profit for 30k investment, we all know that only stonks can do it.

Research and development

(AR p.103) SHOPIFY spends hundreds of millions on research and development. But we don’t see any increase in intangible assets or PPE. Why a company that uses creative accounting to show good sales is not using it to capitalize R&D expenses and show higher profit? In my opinion, because those expenses aren't R&D but Cost of sales. Recently companies started to use creative accounting to reclass COGS to R&D and show better gross profit margin. The most recent example is Plug power.
Just comparable figures, annual Research Expenditures of universities:
Princeton University - 326,207,000, University of Chicago - 433,328,000
Do you think that Shopify is more research oriented than some top universities?

Unrealized gain on equity and other investments

Despite all the manipulations P&L still does not look good. We have 90 million income from operations from a company with >100 bln. market cap.
To show a better picture SHOPIFY decided to find another source of income – revaluation of purchased assets – 135 million. It is 150% of income from operations. (AR p.120) They received investment in Affirm in July and measured it low. In September they revalued it and got 133 million profit. Both evaluations were done in the same quarter. They have created a profit out of thin air. If we exclude this profit from EPS calculation it will fall to 1.56 and PE ratio will become 700.

Cash

So, P&L a lie. What about balance sheet? It looks empty for 150 billion worth company. In my opinion it even worse.

1) It is missing restricted cash. According to the same contract with Stripe: Shopify USA acknowledges and agrees that Stripe or its financial partners may require a reserve to secure Shopify USA’s liability (the “Stripe Reserve”).

2) The cash itself is not trustable (AR p.118). One reason for that is that it consists mostly of commercial papers and bonds. It is hard to audit, you can't just send confirmation request to the bank and receive a reliable evidence. You perform physical examination of those documents. They can be forged, they can be borrowed. Another reason is that there is a consistent outflow of cash from trading marketable securities. I haven’t found a single report with big reliable cash figure that can be confirmed via bank letter.

3) And finally, why Shopify is purchasing so many securities after all? I have a theory that it is done through the cooperation with banks who underwriting their shares. I will come to it soon. Banks are underwriting their shares and in exchange ask Shopify to buy bad corporate bonds and commercial papers from them, thus getting rid of these bad securities. Then they sell Shopify shares on the stock market to you. In fact, I don’t think that they even sell and buy corporate bonds, they are probably just restructuring them and we will never see billions of real cash on the balance sheet.

In my humble opinion, Shopify has very little cash. About 800 million and half of it is restricted.

So how the company is operating then? How it is surviving?

I will tell you that it is surviving by taking money from different investors, including probably you, from frequent stock offerings. If you look at the page 130 of report, you will see that Shopify was doing offering every 4-6 months. And with time the frequency increases. The last offering was in February this year. Before that it was in September. According to my expectation the next offering will be this year in June-July, then September-October, then November-December and after in January of the next year. Than Shopify will declare bankruptcy and go under administration and  Tobi will go to jail. Because he can’t get out of the boat how 3 of 7 top managers of Shopify did recently. Do you want to sink with him?

Stock manipulation

As a final remark I would add that the sparkle that made me make this dd was target price for Shopify stock that was set by Goldman Sachs. The bank who was selling its client mortgage bonds in 2008 and was buying itself SWAPs. It made several billion profit while their clients lost everything. It had a hearing in congress, paid 6 billion fee but continued to operate. For Shopify February offering Goldman Sachs was underwriter. They did underwriting at 1300 price. Now they suffer loses and they will do everything to sell you these shares. That is why they determined the highest target price above 1 600."
2021-05-31 09:08:24,wallstreetbets,Interesting dd might look closely at their financials. Btw your suggested put strike is insane why not more reasonable strike like 700-800 puts?
2021-05-31 09:59:56,wallstreetbets,"As an auditor, I would like to point out a few things. I'm very short on time, but let me start here (maybe I'll edit later and add stuff). **Bold parts are TLDR.**

&#x200B;

>(AR p.101) In audit opinion it is stated that **revenue recognition (Principal Vs Agent) was a subject to both management and audit judgement.**

In most jurisdictions, including Canadian audit standards, auditors are required to report ""critical audit matters"" when auditing listed entities (in the EU it's called key audit matters). See a short summary on it [here](https://home.kpmg/ca/en/home/insights/2019/07/audit-matters-critical-versus-key.html). Meaning, **the auditor has to report on** ***something.*** Revenue is a very common subject, especially if it's accurate recognition is subject to judgement. To put in bluntly, the auditor here took an ""easy way"" by saying revenue is a critical audit matter because they need to write something anyway and this is an easy one to justify. **One critical audit matter is the required minimum and the fact there is only one is a good thing.**

&#x200B;

>If auditors were sure about correctness of revenue recognition, they wouldn’t mention it.

Quite the opposite. **If they weren't sure about its correctness, they would have to continue with the audit** (by law and professional standards) until they are sure it is correct or it is false. In the latter case, they would force the entity to make corrections or, if the entity does not comply, modify their audit opinion accordingly (basically saying the financial statements are not entirely correct - which they did not). **The auditor gave an unmodified opinion** (p 100, second paragr) **which basically means the financial statements check out.**"
2021-05-31 09:50:49,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it's going to die out anytime soon but good luck on your short. The company has now settled in in the ecommerce industry which is growing year after year. They take money from payments AND from recurring businesses. Every clients making money will always pay them, monthly, minimum 50$/month (30$ + %).  
They don't need ads anymore, all the gurus on YouTube make the entry very easy (tutorials, themes, plugins).  
They have tons of money invested by OTHER companies to bring people to Shopify to use their plugins, templates, themes, autoresponders etc...  
It's snowballing and it won't stop in my opinion. Nice DD."
2021-05-31 10:20:25,wallstreetbets,"This is the dumbest shit I have read. You are trying to value a software company like a factory that makes widest after reading Valuations 101.   
1. Look at revenue to assets of other tech companies to get a baseline (i.e., don't think of assets = PPE)   
2. Look at the TYPE of websites WIX hosts vs SHOP. WIX hosts a bunch of shit, whereas SHOP hosts, well, shops - which drive more payments than your girl friends' boyfriends' blog."
2021-05-31 10:12:16,wallstreetbets,"I am an accountant, but a shitty one. Heres my half-assesd rebutattal to your points, without opening the FS-

> 1) (AR p.101) In audit opinion it is stated that revenue recognition (Principal Vs Agent) was a subject to both management and audit judgement. If auditors were sure about correctness of revenue recognition, they wouldn’t mention it.

 Yes, they would. A huge deal about FS is to not mislead, so they have to *disclose* stuff. They tested revenue, since its like, the most important part of the FS and most likely to be gamed

> 2.) If you review contract terms (section 5) between Stripe, who is processing payments for Shopify, you will see that the whole responsibility and control over payments is on Stripe. In this case Stripe is a principle.

 This doesnt sound like how principal vs agent works. Principal is like, employees of the company, i.e. the company itself Agent is people doing shit on company's behalf

> 3) If you look at the balance sheet (AR p.102) and note 10 (AR p.122) Shopify simply doesn’t have assets (Property, plant and equipment) to process payments, It literally has no infrastructure. You can’t tell me that 9.3 mln. worth computer equipment can generate 3 bln. revenue for a company with >5000 workers.

Yes, you dont need buildings or desk furniture to process payments. A publically traded client of mine went fully remote this past year, and disposed of basically all their PPE. They could also be leasing stuff, which would not be classified under fixed assets

> Despite have that Shopify claims that they have more sales than WIX, the deferred revenue balance of SHOPIFY is less than WIX’s. Maybe WIX is receiving fees more in advance than SHOPIFY, but SHOPIFY has a ratio of amount of deferred revenue to revenue equal to 1 to 27. Meaning that it asks to pay fees more often than every 2 weeks. This is very unlikely since the standard period is minimum one month. The thing is that even the absolute number is lower than WIX, not just percentage.

Deferred revenue is money that has been received, but not earned yet, so they didnt ""do the thing"" or complete their service yet for it to be ""earned"" and be actual revenue yet

 > SHOPIFY spends hundreds of millions on research and development. But we don’t see any increase in intangible assets or PPE. Why a company that uses creative accounting to show good sales is not using it to capitalize R&D expenses and show higher profit? In my opinion, because those expenses aren't R&D but Cost of sales.

expensed vs capitalization has to do with ""will we see a future economic benefit"" i.e. do we have an asset? R&D costs are required to be expensed under GAAP because we dont know if these costs will provide a future economic benefit. Once you obtain a patent, or something like that you value it's future economic benefit, and it goes on the balance sheet as an intangible.

> 1) It is missing restricted cash. According to the same contract with Stripe: Shopify USA acknowledges and agrees that Stripe or its financial partners may require a reserve to secure Shopify USA’s liability (the “Stripe Reserve”). 

""May"" = May or May not



> 2) The cash itself is not trustable (AR p.118). One reason for that is that it consists mostly of commercial papers and bonds.

I haven’t found a single report with big reliable cash figure that can be confirmed via bank letter.

Lol. Bank confirms are commonplace, but not the only way to test cash. Money can be borrowed, but thats why they do bank recs to reconcile what they bank says they have to what the company says they have


Having said all that, all auditors will tell you that audits are a joke so dont take what I said as advice. I'm also not an auditor lol"

\- e-commerce is up huge, my store has quadrupled it's revenue since the pandemic started

\- I pay out the butt for their fees - including through their shopify payments which is taken with each sale.

\- I don't like the comparison with wix - they're not even on the same planet when it comes to ease of use, convenience, and features. Whether Shopify is a fraud or not - there is no competition with them, there is a reason why FB partnered with SHOP and integrates easily with Instagram.  I would never ever compare wix, and with just a few hours of research it became obvious why Shopify is king in this space - and I don't regret going with them at all for my store.

>Our subscription plans typically have a one-month term, however those who sign on to Shopify Plus initially have annual or multiyear subscription terms.

If they signed up a lot of new merchants in 2020 from covid and they prepaid annual or multi-year plans then they would have an outsized amount of deferred revenue. We should expect to see this ratio decline over the next quarters/years if growth flattens out."

2021-05-31 11:49:18,wallstreetbets,"You're making far too many assumptions.

You have no idea what the contract with Stripe looks like. As far as you know Stripe is merely contracted to handle the complexities of the transactions, and Shopify carries all the risk and owns all the data. This gives them portability, they can just plug in a different Stripe whenever they want. They won't divorce one another because they need each other, but I'm willing to bet my left nut that they can.

Their R&D costs are actually their R&D costs. I know as you all type on Reddit you think all this shit just magically works, but it's not magic. To handle ecommerce at the scale that Shopify does takes a brutal amount of R&D. If you understood the complexity of just handling the inventory complexity atomically at that scale your little brain would implode.

The most sus thing on their balance sheet was that a major portion of Rev came from the Affirm IPO.

On the offerings - it is a hot market, they likely recognize they are getting a great valuation and they are cashing in so that if the market cooled they would have money in their war chest.  


Is their valuation insane? Absolutely. Is there any truth in anything you said? Not likely.

I have my sources, they are very good, but I'm not about to dox myself just to prove you wrong."

2021-05-31 09:49:58,wallstreetbets,"Anyone who runs a shop with shopify can tell you they're shady.

And so on.

Once there is a better option for the same price, most stores will bounce.  No, wix isn't better.  Shopify merely hit the scene first."

They earn a small fee on all transactions running through their site, maybe 1% when it's all said and done after paying the cc processing fees. So you could back in to their gross profit as a cross check if you had a good feeling for their overall gross revenue on stores they host."

Shift4 is already an industry leader in terms for payment processing. They will take Shopify’s market share. Why would customers pay hundreds of dollars when they can get a similar product for less cost. Only caveat is that ahift4 is still creating templates and plugins for their platform where as Shopify already have it, but charges a ahit ton."

2021-05-31 09:33:47,wallstreetbets,!wsbgold
2021-05-31 10:09:17,wallstreetbets,"Just some counter points

> 3) If you look at the balance sheet (AR p.102) and note 10 (AR p.122) Shopify simply doesn’t have assets (Property, plant and equipment) to process payments, It literally has no infrastructure. You can’t tell me that 9.3 mln. worth computer equipment can generate 3 bln. revenue for a company with >5000 workers.

Why not?  If they use hosted cloud infrastructure then any of the 'normal' spending on PPE would be listed as an expense or COG.  If there was no corresponding increasing in a different account then this would be a flag but just looking at a single account doesn't create an issue by itself.  Further, they could be setting their CapEx threshold over the cost of their computers/laptops so that laptops/computers they buy for employees are accounted for as expenses instead of PPE allowing their PPE account be effectively $0 for their size.

> 5) Despite have that Shopify claims that they have more sales than WIX, the deferred revenue balance of SHOPIFY is less than WIX’s. Maybe WIX is receiving fees more in advance than SHOPIFY, but SHOPIFY has a ratio of amount of deferred revenue to revenue equal to 1 to 27. Meaning that it asks to pay fees more often than every 2 weeks. 

Not sure how that is suggested from the ratio.  If a company has a single revenue source and it charges monthly for a monthly subscription then its deferred revenue could be fairly reported as $0 (you could argue that they cannot fully recognize it until the end of the month but then they could also be recognize parts of it daily too).  You only really end up seeing significant deferred revenue if a company charges multiple months upfront.  Now Shopify also has other revenue streams as well outside of its subscription model with subscriptions making up only ~33%.  Assuming the rest of their revenue does not generate any significant deferred revenue (it probably doesn't given it is non-subscription based), you can redo the ratio calculation using just the subscription revenue and come up with a non-problematic number.

> (AR p.103) SHOPIFY spends hundreds of millions on research and development. But we don’t see any increase in intangible assets or PPE. 

You wouldn't.  You really only see an increase in PPE, related to IP generation, if you acquire a company.  You might see an increase due to equipment purchased, but that would be minimal for a company using cloud-services and developing code/algorithms."

So listen up apes. Just because an audit report contains CAMs, does not mean that it is not GAAP based presentation. It just means that the auditor spent a lot of time on the portion of the audit because it is critical and difficult to audit. But if the auditors report is unqualified, then the auditor is telling you that the audit did not identify any material misstatements in the financial statements.

Edit: read the auditors report. It is using PCAOB standards. They use both gross and net revenue reporting. I’m convicted that this guy must be trying to make a market for these far out of the money puts, or he is truly retarded and belongs here."

By the way please stop spreading fud about auditors they have alot on the line doing these statements and fraudulently releasing an unqualified opinion when it should have been qualified or dislaimed would tank their practice, even a big 4 firm - with a company this size and with such a mega market cap. 
I'd sell your puts bossman you are going to get burned"
2021-05-31 12:10:39,wallstreetbets,So are you betting on them getting caught and their stock tanking? Shorting at 150 seems impossible to pull of and even if they were defrauding investors there is a reason they haven't been caught yet and they probably never will be.
2021-05-31 14:43:46,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for clarifying more here. Are you saying that they claim $X revenue from Payment Processing, but then directly pay Stripe $X in processing fees? If that's the case, I agree the revenue is a bit disingenuous, unless they have a clear plan to move off stripe (I would expect SHOP to optimize payment country by country, using stripe in lower volume countries)."
2021-05-31 09:46:22,wallstreetbets,Shop is a scalable turnkey solution to ecommerce.  My company uses shopify and we'd never dream of switching.  What more is there to know?
2021-05-31 09:37:15,wallstreetbets,"No they're an e-commerce platform that handles all the backend for the user in a simple interface. Also, what other PPE would be required than a computer server for processing the payments? Do you think they need to own a railroad or something? An excavator?"
2021-05-31 13:51:51,wallstreetbets,"Shopify is more sales oriented but essentially you are correct that you can achieve similar results. Even so, they are not the same company so...

""FWIW, with new US GAAP revenue recognition standard (ACS 606) Stripe’s topline likely on a “net revenue” basis after pass-through costs (interchange, network fees, etc), so $350M “revenue” from SHOP probably overstating somewhat. No real economic difference, just the accounting""-BlueToothDDS

2021-05-31 10:36:47,wallstreetbets,"There is almost 0 chance SHOP blows up by Jan 2022. You realize that is only 7 months away right? They won't have even reported 2021 results yet.

Even if your thesis is right you are playing this wrong. I know multiple people who work at SHOP and they are definitely not in crisis mode right now, which they would be if they are about to implode."
2021-05-31 11:06:01,wallstreetbets,"It was good DD. You’re gonna get wrecked on those puts though. Even shit companies can stay alive for a long time, as you already mentioned. Reminds me of SEAS, terrible on paper but just keeps going up"

2021-05-31 16:48:46,wallstreetbets,"Deleted prev comment because my numbers were off. If deferred income is just coming from subscription solutions though, then we can take the following:

WIX Q1 avg monthly is 101m rev. Deferred income is 59m EOQ and 50m prev Q which is about half a month of deferred revenue.

From the SHOP AR, 2020 subscription revenue was 908m = 75m/month, deferred income is 21m. A little under half a month, but could also be explained if many of their customers are setting up to start billing at the beginning of the month, then at end of month (balance sheet date) there would be less deferred income.

The difference just doesn't seem big enough that it couldn't be due to differences in billing specifics between the two companies."

2021-05-31 14:57:49,wallstreetbets,"1. It is not critical audit matter. It is in note to financial statements, not in audit opinion. 
2. You confuse estimate with method. Estimate is for example when you sell software with customer support for 2 years in a single contract where price of segment is not identified. Then estimate that for example you will reconze 80% of contract at the point of sale and the 10% at the end of each year. Method is about do you control goods delivered to the customer or you are just a middleman responsible only for your part."

2021-05-31 12:41:43,wallstreetbets,Long shot no doubt but look at the price history. It was $200 in March 2019 so it's not like falling back to $200 is completely out of the question. It would be like Tesla falling back to $100. Unlikely but you never know.

I could say that I have both CIA and ACCA qualifications and worked for 4 years on big 4, but I didn't because it is not relevant. I have seen plenty of stupid auditors.

2021-05-31 14:07:32,wallstreetbets,"ok, 1) Audit opinion doesn’t guarantee correctness. It gives reasonable assurance. All big scandals were with audited companies. 
2) 1.5 million USD total audit fee. Several companies, multiple revenue screams, billions of transactions, million stores. Yes, I doubt that with this low fee audit was conducted properly. When I worked in KPMG, client (Qiwi) that is much smaller than Shopify was charged 2 mln. USD for test of internal controls only. And 2 times of it for audit."
2021-05-31 17:47:37,wallstreetbets,"Same standards bossman, IFRS is used for all public companies in the US and CAD. But yes its all judgment based, and you can probably justify capitalizing most dev costs if you choose to do so."

2021-05-31 11:13:55,wallstreetbets,Paypal and Shopify are completely different businesses. I dont think you understand how platforms operate.
2021-05-31 10:37:15,wallstreetbets,If they are processing payments via stripe why would they need same level as PayPal? Unless we can determine their partnership cut with stripe it’s irrelevant info?
2021-05-31 17:45:01,wallstreetbets,"The sec filing is from 2013. Shop have moved on from driving transactions through third party merchants ages ago. ( stripe being one of them originally) They set up shopify payments in partnership , yes partnership with stripe! So now they get smaller cut but if much larger pot, by offering it cheaper"
2021-05-31 19:13:06,wallstreetbets,"u mixed up paypal is payment processing and credit 

shop is ecommerce platform with a side of payments"
2021-05-31 10:16:12,wallstreetbets,"This could be a good play. I do see an oversaturation in the Ecommerce sphere and a trend towards consolidation of markets with Amazon and Aliexpress as examples. Additionally, he likely has a point on their finances. The problem, as I see it, is that while there may be a powder keg, we need a spark. If major firms have a vested interest in SHOP staying or becoming viable, they will do everything they can to make that happen and make sure we don't get our spark. As a whole, retail investors cannot out maneuver major players simply do to volume and influence. We would need a situation to occur in which the major firms cannot recover it. The reality is, the financial are public information and I guarantee that other people have noticed the financial problems, but like Uber, none of that matters unless someone way more important than us gets the ball rolling."

2021-05-31 17:19:07,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha OP is spot on, you understand if they don’t give their tick of approval they are just going to go with the other 3 next year. The audit industry’s conflict of interest is a joke."
2021-05-31 18:18:48,wallstreetbets,As a Canadian last thing ill trust is auditors. We had so many scandals of companies in the exact same spotlight.

Keep these coming. I don't even read the subtitles, they distract from the best left turn in the industry."

Unfortunately, there are some men that try so hard to be the ""alpha male"" that they forget about the concept of human decency. It's one thing to be confident with a woman, it's another thing to be an outright asshole. I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park. Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. First, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. Use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to “coo” gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me."

2021-05-31 10:01:40,wallstreetbets,"I think for a lot of people - the point of plant based meat is combatting the enormous environmental toll of factory farming, or just the ethics (if that’s your issue) It’s not usually a health choice (although red meat specifically is pretty bad for you in mass)"
2021-05-31 14:40:53,wallstreetbets,The wanna be social justice warriors need their attention and validation.
2021-05-31 09:54:29,wallstreetbets,There is nothing healthy and the fake meat. More people need to look into what ingredients they are using  its crazy.
2021-05-31 11:13:29,wallstreetbets,"If you want to eat healthy, just eat fruits and vegetables, and sugar free etc.  Why do the fake meat folks insist on calling it plant based meat?  Just to poke their finger in the eyes of carnivores?  Because they can't sell it if they call it what is?  Highly processed peas, bamboo etc., with other additives, even beet juice for it to be red like ""meat""?  WTF?  Don't order the Impossible burger, order the side salad."
2021-05-31 10:07:18,wallstreetbets,Thats all of the world
2021-05-31 11:20:34,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I had a friend visit and I bought snacks for our weekend.  She was a vegetarian.  I bought fruit, granola, yogurt. you know what I thought was good snacks.  Nope, that yogurt has too much sugar.  But it's Greek yogurt?  I don't eat that one, take me to the Whole Foods. 

lady in front of us put her 17 items on the belt, told the cashier hold on, got her reading glasses out of her purse and said....""I'll read you the bar code off each item I don't want no laser beams touching my food.""  After I picked myself up off the floor from laughing so hard I had to hold my tongue to not ask her if she needed help making sure her tin foil hat was on straight.

tl:dr  Some of these health food people are straight up whackadoodles."
2021-05-31 12:23:50,wallstreetbets,"I've been vegan for 15 years and am happy to see plant-based alternatives becoming mainstream. However, I don't really enjoy the Impossible or Beyond Meat burgers. They taste way too similar to meat for my comfort. I prefer bean burgers, or maybe vegan chicken substitutes occasionally. The ""beet juice blood"" is pretty gross IMO, but I see how it could be appealing to those who are trying to reduce their meat consumption for whatever reason but still like the taste/texture of meat. I know a lot of people who are vegan/vegetarian for ethical reasons, and they also do not care for super ""meaty"" products. I think those burgers are geared more towards those who eat plant-based for health reasons."
2021-05-31 12:32:26,wallstreetbets,"That actually turns me off these products. They're trying to appeal to the masses, not to the vegetarians. To me those products are either a transition food for people changing to a vegetarian diet, or just people that follow the fads because they're popular. I've been a vegetarian for a few years now and only occasionally eat a Beyond Meat patty, but for my family it's usually something we use to appeal to the others that still eat meat."

2021-05-31 17:58:39,wallstreetbets,"When I was 18 I worked at a typical big box. We had like 30-40 employees and the entire front of house was decent looking girls. 

There was one dude who I guess was decent looking, but came off like a surfer dude from an 80s movie in his attitude (lots of dude, whaaaa, naaaah” type talking. He was a good dude, but for whatever reason the girls were all ready to throw themselves at him. 

One night I walk to the front and he’s standing there chatting up a couple of girls. By chatting up I mean going “uh huh, whoaaaa, yeah,” As they swoon. 
As I’m up there getting returns one of them says something about a threesome, floating the idea by like a balloon passing in the night. Stealthily, it goes almost unnoticed, until it pops. 

“Isn’t it every guys dream to have a threesome,” she says as I fall on the floor in shock. 

My dude 100% oblivious to what’s going on goes, “nahhhh”.

At this point we were all stunned. “Why? I thought every guy wanted that?” 

“Then I got to worry about disappointing two girls at once. It’s too much work.”"

2021-05-31 10:29:28,wallstreetbets,"I mean most of the studies conducted for environmental impact statistics were conducted by Beyond Meat. https://www.rd.com/article/downside-of-alternative-meat/

Really there isn't a whole lot of data on the environmental impact since soil tillage and the pollution of industrial farming are also a concern. Not to mention the amount of pollution and energy that is wasted in factories and transportation of both vegetables,ingredients, and the fake meat after processing.

I wouldn't be surprised if after calculating transport combined with soil tillage the carbon impact is worse than industrial farming, but again there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of independent data on things such as Beyond Meat. So it is hard to take the word of the company profitting off it."
2021-05-31 11:12:32,wallstreetbets,"But is it non GMO, antibiotic free, plant based meat?"

Add in that processing also happens to all meat, you have a really basic logical argument that suggests growing meat directly is a sensible environmental idea."

You are knowingly skewing your source. Please stop misquoting your own source to serve your purposes and lets have an unbiased discussion. Name calling and saying someone is outright "" wrong AF"" is a terrible way to go about it.

Your source says from other livestock not ""other food productions"" without even mentioning fake meat or an analysis of it.  You had to deliberately change this btw. Stuff like this makes most people sick rather than directly quoting your own source. Please stop being disingenuous, no one cares who is right or wrong here, except egotistical pricks.

2021-05-31 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What is DTC and why you still shouldn't care I often see people in the daily thread leaving lazy comments about, ""Ticker X has short interest of Y%"". This is dumb, and you should feed bad about wasting our time with something so useless.

&#x200B;

# What is short interest

Here we find the first reason why this is dumb comment. Short interest is an incredibly vague concept. Usually you see it reckoned as a percentage of the float, or the shares outstanding, but even this is not a consistent definition. Thinking back to the GME runup there were two numbers being thrown around for Short Interest, 140% and 270%.

&#x200B;

The first number (140%) was short interest divided by the \*total shares outstanding\*. If a company has 1000 shares outstanding and 200 shares have been short sold, this works out to a 20% short ratio. But not every outstanding share is available to trade on any given day. Many will be owned by the company itself, insiders, and institutions that are not legally allowed to sell them without doing a bunch of publicly available (priced in) paperwork. So sometimes you'll see numbers like the second (270%) which use the shares that are available to trade on any given day as the denominator. If only 700 shares are available to the market that will increase the short float to almost 30%.

&#x200B;

Trouble is, how do you define a share that is available to trade? If you don't know the definition that was used when calculating the number you're throwing around, then you don't know what the short float number \*actually means\*. And if you don't know or can't explain it then you shouldn't be wasting our time with it because its meaningless.

&#x200B;

# What is Days to Cover

There is *another* way of reckoning short interest that actually does have some validity. **Days to Cover** is a measure of how many days of trading it would take for every short position to be unwound. This is the total number of shares shorted divided by the average trading volume. That ratio is the number of days *on average* it would take for shorts to cover. If every short position had to be closed as quickly as possible it would take that many days *if every share traded were used to close a short position* for short interest by any metric to reach zero. This is at least a little bit useful because you can tell how long an increase in buying pressure from short positions being closed is likely to last.

&#x200B;

# Why even DTC is not particularly useful

&#x200B;

Even DTC can be an inconsistent metric, though, as likely not every short position must be closed immediately (reducing DTC) and the fact that it is taking the *average* volume means that a single high volume day could easily drop that number substantially. You don't know what's going to happen just because you have access to a single metric which is also available to every other trader on the market -and that includes those with open shorts. Going back to the GME example, even at the height of the short squeeze craze DTC was sitting at just over six days. Six days of *average* volume to cover and we saw trade volumes that were an order of magnitude higher than that average. Does that mean the shorts covered? Who knows. You certainly don't, even if someone on the internet told you they didn't.

&#x200B;

# It's probably not a short squeeze

While the concept of a short squeeze is valid, you need to understand that they are incredibly rare events. If you want to make trading them your primary strategy, have fun, but be ready to wait a **long** time (*years*) for the next opportunity. You don't know when short positions need to be unwound, and there's no way for you to force anyone to do it involuntarily. You can be sure that they are doing everything in their power to minimize their losses/maximize their profits and you should do the same. Why should we believe that a ticker that is 30% short with a DTC < 1 is going to squeeze? If you can't explain that, then it's not worth crowing about. *Nobody cares about your half-thought out conspiracy theory.* DFV spent a *year* building his case and still came within a few months of his positions expiring worthless. Michael Burry almost went bankrupt waiting for the housing market to crash. *You don't hear the stories of the ones who lost it all, even if they were right on the premise*.

&#x200B;

If you've got knowledge of squeeze that is incoming, great, but build a case for it. Wildly screaming, ""GME SHORT INTEREST 30%"" in the daily is not a case. Shouting ""GME DTC 1.4 DAYS"" is a little more informative, but ultimately meaningless without further context. Can they afford to spread the covering out over several days? A week? *Four fucking months?* How many are held by a single entity, and therefore likely to be closed all at once? What is the price doing? Why would they get squeezed if the position is profitable and looks to continue being profitable for the foreseeable future? If you don't know, then nobody is going to care.

&#x200B;

# No Bullshitting

We have a rule here: ""No Bullshitting"". ""Don't make shit up, and be responsible giving and taking advice. This includes talking about things you don't know about. You should listen, not talk. Nobody wants an ill-informed opinion. Lurk More."" *Nobody wants an ill-informed opinion*. **Nobody wants an ill-informed opinion**.

2021-05-31 10:59:24,wallstreetbets,GET FUKED> We KNOW WHAT WE DOING. YOU BIG FKIN NEGATIVE APE
2021-05-31 10:11:58,wallstreetbets,There was only one short squeeze and that was GME in Jan. Now it's just retards and whales buying the shit out of OTM calls when IV is low and FOMO.
2021-05-31 19:24:24,wallstreetbets,"GME is now a value play, a potential squeeze is the cherry on top. DFV doubled down, GameStop themselves are recognizing the squeeze and RC is transforming the company. It costs me nothing to hold and my biggest ever regret trading was selling Tesla too early, not doing that with GME.

But you know what, January 28th and March 10th are the biggest indicators that this stock is being heavily manipulated. Retail does not have the coordination to drop a stock 70% in an hour and then have it recover for the rest of day. So fuck you OP, I want you to lose all your money.

Everyone else can buy and hold whatever stock they like. I like GME."
2021-05-31 11:51:10,wallstreetbets,"Hedging short positions with options is literally on investopedia, but apes rather read 13f filings and FTD reports than gettin a basic understanding.
 
That beeing said, i still hold some gme and wanna see how it plays out, im sure even you dont have the faintest idea... 
But thats also exactly what annoys me most about those apes; 100 million floor is just a question of when and relativations are downvoted out of naivety and spite.. fuckin ***cringe kongs***

2021-05-31 18:43:41,wallstreetbets,"DTC means Depository Trust Company” every trade is settled thru DTC they are the ones who put shares you buy in your acct and take shares you sell out if your acct to make sure the buyer if your shares gets them.  Where you write  (reducing DTC) actually makes ZERO sense the 2 words have nothing to do with each other.  DTC reports “shorts” bring stock someone sold but does not have those shares, it doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with someone doing a “short sale” so DTC is very important or no trades would settle.
So maybe YOU should do better research, I didn’t even read the rest of your manifesto once I saw the DTC comment."

Through the forest of emojis, I vaguely gathered that DFV was the person who realized that a short squeeze was inevitable, and everyone was hopping on his bandwagon.

But after watching that video, I realize I had it all wrong. DFV really does believe in the fundamentals of the company and really is in it for the long haul. That's why he didn't sell when prices spiked earlier this year.

That video really has changed my whole outlook on how to invest, especially with GME."
2021-05-31 14:08:43,wallstreetbets,He clearly referenced a possible short squeeze in some of his videos. He mentioned it could possibly go to like $50-60 in at least one video when GME was around $12 I believe.

DFV did get into it as a value play but part of the reason it was undervalued is that it was being attacked by short sellers who thought they could bankrupt it during the pandemic.

Everyone needs to u derstand that a hedge fund is not the wild west. It's heavily controlled by policies and risk management departments that look after clients interests. You can't just play cowboy.

Not following why you added in that last part. One of the founding principles of game theory is the rational actor. How do we define what a rational actor is? 

Using GME as a proxy, are we at a point where being irrational should be quantified/modeled as being rational, and for lack of a better example, perhaps the parameters of the prisoner's dilemma should be adjusted to properly reflect that? Game theory does win in the end."

2021-05-31 17:38:27,wallstreetbets,"Naked shorting can cause this. Hedge funds are *required* to report their short sales to the DTCC or face a fine. Unfortunately, that fine is generally small compared to how much profit this rakes in. Bankrupting a company is the ultimate short. 

Hedge funds can sell synthetic shares to people either throigh IOUs like in the case with Robinhood, or through borrowing shares on margin that they do not cover. Both of these can result in shares being legitimized by the voting process when people transfer to a different broker, or by voting regularly through on places like Robinhood. Plain and simple it's the sheer volume of shares either shorted and not covered, and shares sold short and not accounted for OR covered that will make more shares than are available- shares which become legitimized by voting, then go into the voting count that will be higher than available, actual shares.

The point of the GME discussion and scenario is that this hasn't happened before. That's why it's gone on for so long. There aren't any safeguards against this exact situation and even something that does exist for situations like this are skirted around by institutions and hedge funds for raw profit. It's negligence and greed that caused this, and the sheer amount of synthetic shares. Just like in 2008, negligence and greed. No one meant to crash the economy. It just did due to institutional negligence and greed."

The GME premise might say that they went for a bankruptcy jackpot and it didn’t work out. That would mean they were naked shorting GME to kill it and keep all the SI as profit. That they couldn’t dig themselves out by simply hedging at that point."
2021-05-31 14:37:50,wallstreetbets," There's definitely irrationality at play, but I'd argue less than you might think. The ones promoting the squeeze nonsense are acting in a way they expect to maximize their own utility regardless whether it's a conscious decision or not. (Even the ones who think they're doing it for some collective goal are, in my opinion, still acting selfishly. If true altruism existed it would have been weeded out by evolution a *long* time ago)

Prisoner's Dilemma may not be the most appropriate game for a situation like this, though. For one thing, it's iterated, but more importantly future payouts are not known until it is time to play that particular round, but are continent on the number of players still actively cooperating (if you trust the ""logic"" of the thing in the first place). In a case like that it it's only reasonable to expect the rate of defection to only increase with time. The more of them that defect the lower the potential payout for those who remain. There will always be the losers who bail last, but what's irrational about it is that the ones here seem (to the outside observer) hell bent on minimizing their returns, but in their mind a cooperative strategy will be victorious. I don't think they will be, but I do think they're convinced that's in their best interest and thus the ""rational"" choice. 

Man, now I want to do some simulations to see how well that hypothesis holds up, though! Thank you for getting me thinking about this!"

Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think that's the right approach here given that  T+21 days is only useful in predicting the outcome of 1-2 days in a 21 day cycle. The rest of the cycle lacks the same buying pressure, is therefore subject to more randomness, and one might argue may even be more susceptible to market manipulation. For these reasons I'd expect the time-series correlation to be fairly weak, although I'm not really familiar with ARIMA, so happy to hear your thoughts. You'll notice however that these cycles line up exactly with FTDs but I'm not sure how to share DDs from other subreddits without getting automoded."

2021-05-31 18:09:54,wallstreetbets,"For people to vote the brokerage needs to withdraw shares from lending and account for them.

You cannot vote unless you have real shares.

Naked shorting happens, but nowhere near to the scale anyone imagines.

There is no such thing as synthetic shares, iou or other silly stuff you read in reddit. Google it and see if you find any educational or reputable source talking about such things. It doesn't exist, it's reddit fiction. Also, if shorts don't post collateral they get their positions liquidated, which means all shares sold short are bought back by the brokerage. Hence its no possible to have more shares than the float.

The only exception would be due to naked shorting, but again its done in limited scale due to penalties and risk of being kicked out of brokerages etc. Everything else is unsubstantiated made up stuff.

Again, for voting all shares are recalled from shorts, so you cannot end up with more votes than shares or float. The process does not let it happen, and during that process any naked shorting is eliminated. The system may not be perfect but it sure isn't that lax.

If you have reputable sources that present your case please let me know. There is so much research and analysis done in finance that for sure we would have precedents and journal articles written about such distortions or outliers."

Pull up OBV, with or without AH trading, scale to day, and go check out a bunch of blue chips.  Watch how OBV correlates price in every single one of them, then go check out the meme stocks.  As initially skeptical - I scoured other securities to find anything more disconnected from its OBV than gamestop, and came up with nothing.

The 2012 movie ‘The Wall Street Conspiracy’ documents the media involvement in the Overstock case in great detail.  An anonymous tip to then CEO Patrick Byrne detailed exactly what was going to happen, and by which reporters as well.  I don’t buy into alex jones gay frog foil hat type wacko stuff at all - but this shit actually happened, and not only involves media manipulation but implicates major broker / dealers as well.  It is a must-watch for anyone looking to get a better understanding of the issues at hand.

All the earmarks of these other well documented stocks being abusively sold short - are present on GME.  Ftd’s, media telling us daily to ‘forget gamestop’ - as well as the involvement of the same usual suspects.  The only difference this time, is the target isn’t dying a quiet death.  It is as healthy as can be, and has a devout legion of pitchfork wielding supporters.  This has literally never happened, and with all the new DTCC & subsidiary rule changes - will never happen again.  Not just once in a lifetime.  Just once."

So I have to sell at life changing amounts or keep it forever unless I want to financially ruin myself and my family

2021-05-31 15:26:40,wallstreetbets,"Sure. Answer some questions for me first.

What makes OBV go up? What makes it go down? What determines how much it goes up by? What does OBV tell you about buy volume vs sell volume?"
2021-05-31 14:32:52,wallstreetbets,"Is there a specific tool or configuration that you're using to visualize this? Because I just took a look at GME, AMC, Ford, and AAPL with Active Trader Pro and they all appear to match up with their respective OBV indicators to about the same degree.

Also, with respect to your last paragraph: Gamestop isn't exactly ""as healthy as can be"". It's not on death's door right now, but saying that it's a healthy is a bit of an overstatement. I mean, the business needs to undertake a *major* pivot just to survive, (if they were to keep their current model they would just slowly bleed out over the years, as has has been happening). Needing to completely refocus in order to stay in business isn't generally considered a trait of a healthy company. Even if there is a high level of faith in the current leadership's ability to find that new market niche and execute, there's still a lot of risk and work to be done before it will get back to ""healthy company"" status.

I just wanted to make that point since it's the only other part of your comment that I can respond to right now without being able to see the disconnected OBV trend that you're referring to yet."

2021-05-31 19:35:27,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, so this is where I feel timeseries falls apart - there isn't a signal for 21 out of 22 days, or roughly 95% of the cycle. If you have a way of accounting and parameterizing that, then great, I'm interested in seeing the results. Otherwise, I'd expect the same outcome that you are expecting.  


To take this one step further, the magnitude of buying pressure on T+21 days has DIRECTLY CORRESPONDED to Married puts from option expiries. The more married puts that expired, the bigger the surge. I'd go as far as arguing that one could predict within a narrow range the closing price of T+21 days given the closing price of the day prior, and the amount of expired married puts.   


Until this is taken advantage of by day traders, I expect this trend/signal to continue, and will gladly take you up on a bet ;)"

2021-05-31 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Samsung Heavy shorts Hello APES

This is not financial advice.

I would like to share some information Korea has recently lifted a ban on short selling of stocks. Since the ban was lifted Samsung has become the most heavily shorted stock.

The ban was in effect from March 2020  - March 2021. During the pandemic Korea saw a huge amount of outflow from Korean ETFs and to limit this outflow Korea placed a ban on short selling.

http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210530000128

With the ban lifted foreign investors have resumed heavily shorting many Korean stocks.

A few reasons of why I am bullish on Samsung.

1. The advances in 5G make it more likely people with older gadgets will make the move to newer models. Currently I think Samsung is the only company that can make its products with all Samsung parts (true end to end).

2. Samsung’s investment of $17 Billion into a chip facility is more than foreign investments. It’s a way for the company to move away from South Korea and maybe save on corporate taxes by using the same loopholes that many US tech giants use.

3. The recent $10 billion inheritance tax paid by the Lee family - Samsung owners. This readiness to pay such a ridiculous amount of money makes me think this might be used to pressure the current govt. to reduce the sentence of the heir and current CEO Lee Jae Yong.

4. A new president will be in office soon (10 months) if my understanding of foreign policy is correct. The current administration President Moon has been a real PAIN for Samsung. This has something to do with the former President and her close ties with the company."

There's a chip shortage and Samsung is making a ton of wafers these days, a lot more orders than before.

what if they are shorting themselves to not have to pay that much inheritance tax? from what i read families tend to try to keep stock as low as possible, so that they dont have to pay that much in death tax?

also why would not the heirs just leave SK for another jurisdiction that doesnt have 40% death tax?"

2021-05-31 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"People are missing the point on Burry's $534m Tesla short People don't see the full idea behind Michael Burry's TSLA short. Every single article is about how he tweeted at papa Musk and how he thinks that the company is the worst thing since he dropped his glass eye into his cat's litter box.

He doesn't think that Tesla will implode. He doesn't think it's a failing company. He just sees the reality, which is that all of their profits/revenues are way in the future.

Let's just say you win a time-delayed lottery and get $1,000,000 in 15 years. Not bad! Now let's say you won the same lottery in Venezuela in 2005. It's not even worth cashing the ticket.

It's the same deal with companies. Growth companies, however promising, have most of their expected profits in the future. Those profits have to be discounted by the **interest rate** to be turned into todays dollars. In other words, it doesn't matter how much money Tesla is going to make in the future if interest rates surge today. Well... it does matter... it's just worth a lot less.

So how does this relate to the Burry bet? You just have to scroll down a few lines on his 13F filing.

Burry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around \~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.

Interest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.

TL;DR:

The Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation)."

I'd like to add that Facebook and Google aren't just big tech companies with strong balance sheets, but they are also key players in the advertising space, an industry which will benefit from inflation as companies will want to pass their cost basis onto consumers, and in order to successfully do that, they will want to establish their brand image, this spending more on advertising.

Also, these being software companies, they tend to have lower Capex so rising material costs will likely affect them less. These factors combined are why I think these companies were among the top picks for his portfolio, alongside his volatility plays."
2021-05-31 00:06:08,wallstreetbets,"TLDR (I think): Value of a business is the present value of all future cash flows. Higher the federal funds rate, higher the discount rate (WACC). Therefore, present value of the same cash flow is worth less.

Anecdotally, this is why NASDAQ is more negatively impacted by whispers of higher rates, since many of the constituents are growth companies with positive cash flows in the distant future."
2021-05-31 04:35:26,wallstreetbets,"> The Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation).

It's also a bet against TSLA. Not a bet that Tesla the company implodes, but that TSLA the stock will eventually drop to a value that is justified by the fundamentals and the projected future earnings. As it stands today, it's incredibly overvalued. Saying that TSLA is overvalued is not the same as saying ""hurrr durrr it's a shit company""."

Only he would probably have that information though."

2021-05-31 15:04:17,wallstreetbets,"I look at it from a much wider field of view, having been through many market corrections. I have seen values of cars, Rolexes, houses, rims, stereos all climb - fall - and repeat. 

I have seen two products in my time that were revolutionary - things I identified as both product-changing, and market/industry-changing. 

The first was the first-gen iPod, a $500 device that was amazing - but also took down the music industry as we knew it. I bought 10K of APPL during that time when I could hardly afford an iPod. I sold that investment to put it into Nintendo when the Wii came out. A 40M mistake. 

The only other product that came close was my Tesla cars. I drive 40K miles a year. Have only been in the shop once outside of tires. With the federal rebate and 4K in fuel savings plus near-zero maintenance - it has been an eye-opening experience.

If Tesla can sell a 40K car with a 10K rebate, it is a deal any way you slice it. If they can launch a 25K car with a 10K rebate - it is game over for most other manufactures - especially if costs keep declining as they seem to be. 

I bought 3.5K shares back in 2017 - I have not sold a single share and I won't until something dramatic happens or Tesla becomes the largest valued company on the planet. 

That is just the automotive side of the business. I haven't even touched on FSD or energy storage."
2021-05-31 01:21:09,wallstreetbets,"This is an extremely logical take if we truly end up going into a deleveraged cycle in the economy (recession).

High Inflation would mean more expensive Teslas (due to increase in cost to procure and produce) + higher APR when borrowing. Less people are going to buy a Tesla because its out of peoples affordability. 

I think it's still too early for Tesla to license out their tech since there aren't too many well known competitors at it's scale (other than OGs) so I feel a dump of some sort is inevitable. Burry is early just like in Big Short if he truly things we are a short time away for a deleveraged economy."
2021-05-31 02:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Are there not easier, less risky ways to profit from interest rates than to buy a massive amount of put options on a single company? I'm sure that's part of the equation but I have a feeling Burry believes Tesla is overvalued if interest rates remain the same. I mean we're talking about a company trading at an insane multiple that still isn't able to generate profits based off selling cars. Doesn't seem like a stretch that he thinks it is overvalued."

It did not have anything to do with interest rates.

2021-05-31 12:47:52,wallstreetbets,"Yes, this is correct.

If like Burry you think that the market will go down because of a rise of interest rates, you could short the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq.

But the smarter play is to find the stock with the most room to fall. Firstly as OP mentions, Tesla is a growth stock with a lot of assumed/discounted future earnings. These types of Cathy Wood stocks will be hit the hardest if interest rates go up. Second, find the most overvalued, overhyped stock in that category. Tesla is an excellent choice..."

If I were to take the bull case Tesla can always raise their prices to keep ahead of inflation. Theirs isn't really a price driven model IMHO but a features driven model. When they fall behind the competition in terms of what they're offering then we'll see their valuation drop quickly. And from my perspective while they are ahead in certain areas everyone else is catching up fast."

2021-05-31 12:27:54,wallstreetbets,Shorting tesla has and will always be a bad idea.

2021-05-31 05:59:24,wallstreetbets,"Thats dumb af. To make sense you would have to assume that prices for EV will stay the same regardless of the overall market inflation .

The Real problem with tesla is that it’s not really a great company. European brands will own EV space in Europe, the competition is rising and quality of Tesla cars is lacking. The second issue (way larger) is that we move away from cars, Europe is betting on public transportation and US will have to follow to curb emissions. Tesla is simply overpriced as a company."

2021-05-31 06:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. If BUrry wanted to make a bet on inflation and rising rates he could just short Treasury bonds (Which he has done using puts on $TLT and calls on inverse leverage ETFs that short Treasury bond futures). From their 13-F:

TSLA PUT SIZE: 800,100 SHARE VALUE: 534,411,000

TLT PUT SIZE: 1,266,400 SHARE VALUE: 171,534,000

There is no reason to make a proxy bet against an individual business when you can bet against assets that are more directly affected by rising rates and inflation. (Like TLT, an ETF that tracks US Treasury bonds, which decrease in value when inflation rises or rates rise). He is betting against Tesla because the only reason they make money is by selling enviromental credits they get from the govt to other businesses. They would still be bleeding money if it were not for Uncle Sam's generosity. 

&#x200B;

It is possible that Tesla is a good long-term play (just like Amazon expanded from books to cloud hosting maybe Tesla will expand from an EV company to an Energy company). I believe at least somewhat in reflexivity, but none of this changes the fact that Tesla as it stands today is not a genuinely profitable business and they can not stand on their own feet. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: The bet against Tesla is not a bet on rising interest rates. Burry could just buy more TLT puts if that was his intention. The bet against Tesla is due to their reliance on government handouts to stay in the green."

The ""value"" of Tesla has been PULLED FORWARD now.. for years. It's on track to meet it's current valuation in 5-6 years. But once other automakers get their EV products on the market things will change. 

If Tesla truly is as far ahead in autonomous as they think they are the value now is reasonable. But it won't be pulled forward forever. 

I don't think Burry's put dates have been released. That would be interesting to know."
2021-05-31 06:27:01,wallstreetbets,"So I am playing the long long game, I am thinking 5-10 years. Does this means my long term game is worse or is my mid term play getting a kick in the nuts because of interest rates and inflation?"
2021-05-31 06:35:12,wallstreetbets,Burry May be making a mistake. The non obvious is the strong PR of Tesla stock combined with the retail investment future. Literally a large portion of the world believe Elon is the world saver.
2021-05-31 06:42:43,wallstreetbets,Does anyone know the strikes he's at?
2021-05-31 06:42:54,wallstreetbets,"This is a great observation. It's also a play against Tesla in the traditional sense though. He knows the valuation is undeservingly high, but also feels strongly about supply chain issues, chip shortage, steel prices, and all of that conspires against Tesla. 

His whole portfolio is stacked for high inflation and rising rates."
2021-05-31 06:42:58,wallstreetbets,"This is fairly astute. I think there *must* be more to this than that alone.

If the bet is a vanilla interest rate bet, he can implement it more cleanly in the short rates futures market. Way cheaper, too.

It's possible he's got this on in big part as a bet on rising rates, though the expression through TSLA puts leads me to believe there are other TSLA-specific (or higher level thematic) ideas going on. From my other reading, I'd hypothesize he doesn't view TSLA as a leader in all the spaces they're priced to win right now.

FWIW, IMO anyone serious about portfolio diversification should consider some bets that pay off in an environment of rising rates. 1) It'll hit asset classes broadly, likely hitting your portfolio, 2) It's priced as super cheap insurance today. I think it's a smart hedge (I don't necessarily think it's likely), but probably not Burry's core or sole intent here."
2021-05-31 06:49:12,wallstreetbets,The fed said that interest rates will remain near zero through 2022. The price of Teslas stock will continue to rise as revenue grows.

2021-05-31 07:26:05,wallstreetbets,"> The Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation).

this makes zero sense.   

1.  raising interest rates is deflationary, not inflationary (this was how Volker tamed inflation in the 80s)
2.  if there was going to be inflation, asset prices would go up, i.e. *inflate.*   

Tesla crashing (asset price *deflating*) would be deflationary.

ugh, I'm done with this sub."

I thought the burry hates Tesla stuff were memes"
2021-05-31 07:55:30,wallstreetbets,I’m fairly sure he knows the semiconductor industry is at a shortage and Tesla having electric cars use more then most cars. With Ford already having delays on new cars it’s inevitable that Tesla will also have a problem.
2021-05-31 07:56:18,wallstreetbets,Burry doesn’t think Tesla is going to implode and drop to zero. He believes TSLA is wildly overpriced and has a big drop waiting to meet reality.
2021-05-31 08:02:42,wallstreetbets,"His bet is essentially a play on QQQ (contains GOOG, FB, TSLA, AAPL, etc.) and TLT (20yr+ bonds). So yes, his overall bet is on interest rates going up."
2021-05-31 08:04:47,wallstreetbets,"I mean, you could be right. Recently he shorted the TLT, which is a 20 year US Treasury bond ETF. This was obviously an inflation play and could coincide with this TSLA bet if it follows the same sentiment. He's known for going big or going home."
2021-05-31 08:05:54,wallstreetbets,"The “short” of it: Burry made a bet against the SHARE PRICE, not the COMPANY."
2021-05-31 08:07:58,wallstreetbets,there are bets that pay far more ad costs far less if he just wants to bet on interest rates. This analysis doesnt really make sense.
2021-05-31 08:08:22,wallstreetbets,"Isn't this just two ways of describing the same thing? You could also write it as ""low interest rates make cheap credit available to unviable companies"" and it would be accurate and totally in line with the history of bubbles bursting."

2021-05-31 08:16:42,wallstreetbets,"Tesla was WAY overpriced at $900 which is likely when he got his puts.  Its still overpriced now, but he has likely already gotten his payday for that.  Remember 13f's are after the fact.

He is wrong about VW being better than Tesla when it comes to electric cars though, but that will take time to manifest.

As far as his other plays, I am not smart enough to guess what his strikes/expiration dates are (like his TLT puts, etc)"

When I say a lot I mean I can drive for 15 min and see 5 of them.  That doesn't seen like a lot when you compare it to other brands but when you consider the cost, upkeep, etc it is.

Funny enough 1 out of 5 are old women (like 70+). Must be listening to their grandkids about buying cars."

Last I checked, BMW didn’t have nearly as ridiculous a valuation as Tesla."

5. Cybertruck hits the road this year  
6. Texas power outage was a huge advertisement for solar + Powerwalls 
7. 4680 battery cells are coming online, no one can complete on price for these. 
8. Tesla pivoted their chip usage to avoid the shortage  
9. Single structural castings for model 3 and Y will be a game changer.
10. Tesla has 20 billion in cash onhand, so they don't need to worry about loans.
11. Other automakers continue to pay Tesla regulatory credits.
12. You can make fart noises with the speakers."
2021-05-31 08:54:29,wallstreetbets,"While it may be related to his beliefs about future inflation, his TSLA puts are not a straight inflation play. And it’s not about the time value of their future earnings. Remember, Tesla’s profits will be in future dollars. Tesla adds a lot of value to silicon, aluminum and lithium. As long as they can pass the increased costs on to consumers then their profits will flow with inflation long term.

Also, Tesla owns a lot of assets—land, factories, a huge brand, supply chains, IP, etc. in a true inflation, they will do fine.

Burry is actually betting on inflation expectation disrupting the market, not actual inflation. He thinks that the day the fed signals tapering or rate hikes that the markets will crash—especially Tesla, and that the money will rush to other things. It’s not a long term inflation bet.  He will probably sell you guys his puts the day that happens."

Hes betting that Google or Facebook will outperform Tesla.  Not sure if hes fully hedged but either way he will make money off this position despite the market going up or down if those companies outperform Tesla.

If the NASDAQ falls but google or fb outperform Tesla then he will lose less on the calls than he makes on the puts.  If the market rises he will make more on the calls than he loses on the puts.

2021-05-31 09:21:12,wallstreetbets,exactly
2021-05-31 09:21:25,wallstreetbets,"What Burry also notes, is that a large part of Tesla's earnings come from selling carbon offset units, and without them, the car manufacturing facility is either losing money or not as profitable."

There are different types, which refer to the one banks can lend money among themselves. Inflation on the other hand is how diluted a currencies value becomes over time. Interest will take into consideration inflation but inflation is not equal to interest rates, big difference. What you meant to say in your example was inflation and yes although it is spiking right now it will probably be only temporary. I think Burry’s bet has a lot to to with tesla being over evaluated and fb under evaluated also. Inflation fears have been around in the past many times and they themselves we’re inflated many many times."

Also, companies are discounted by the combination of interest rate they pay on their debt and cost of equity, not just the interest rate. But yeah, IR going up will crush growth stories like tsla.

2021-05-31 09:52:02,wallstreetbets,"I agree with this post, but i still don’t think burry’s Tesla short is a great idea - the market can stay irrational longer than his puts are valid. Although I don’t see too much risk, as tesla is also priced in to become the biggest auto company / battery ever and there are 1000 reasons why this might not happen. But , as mohnish pabrai says “don’t short a guy who backflips two rockets and lands them simultaneously”"
2021-05-31 09:53:14,wallstreetbets,"This doesnt make sense, sorry. 

He definitively doesn't short Tesla because he expects hyperinflation. That's why he put TLT Puts and TBT Calls. 

Tesla is definitively a short term bet because of the rotation from tech/growth to value/reopening stocks, which went quit well for him (maybe he is out of that position already)

... I don't think that Burry will short Tesla in the long-term and if he does, IMO he lost his mind, Tesla will rock that shit in the long-term"
2021-05-31 09:53:30,wallstreetbets,"Great thinking u/Icanchangetheworld. I never thought of this as a long short pair trade. Clearly, TSLA will do worse in near term vs lower multiple stocks in an inflation market with higher rates. TSLA is most definitely one of the futures big winners. Furthermore, Burry isn’t betting on TSLA going down forever. Most likely it’s a three month six month bet via options, maybe a year tops. His options could be expiring July and he’s cashing in big profits now. 

For the bulls (and bears), here is a thought, you could have bought AMZN at the absolute top in 1999, and then absolutely crushed for two years. Down like 80% then 30% back to back. Now your $10k investment is $1400. After that, you were on a volatile road to riches. Check this table out. It’s confusing because of splits, but it tells the story. http://www.1stock1.com/1stock1_146.htm
Yes it took years to breakeven. Yes bears danced in the streets on their victory, but the big money went to the patient investor. 

The bears said incumbent retailers could duplicate AMZN too, just as bears say ICE can today. What does AMZN show us? Technology leadership begets technology leadership, and follow on competitors are reluctant to make the profit decimating investments to catch up. Furthermore, the dominance of TSLA in cars and power storage, or automation of driving is far more apparent today then AMZN was in 2001.  Let’s face it, GOOGL just fired their WAYMO CEO after a ?decade? of failure and excuses like this is harder than people believe. 

There is no way to justify every 10 handle of TSLA multiple NOW. When there are 3 car companies in the future, you won’t care how much you over paid in 2021. TSLA more or less has to be one of the 3. Ask any auto CEO, and they will tell you. They just hope they can be Samsung."

2021-05-31 10:04:43,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been interested in stocks my whole life and I went all in learned options and have been trading daily for the last 7months. What this post makes me think about is like how is a stock priced? And what I’ve learned is there is just absolutely no formula for it at all. It is 100% subjective. You realize this once you start watching 50-100 companies daily, you know the news, you know their financials... but guys it has nothing to do with numbers of any kind it’s 100% speculation. Is it EPS, PE, Market Cap, is it any combination of any of those where you can write a formula “a x (b-c)/d=share price” fat chance absolutely not. Take any formula you think you’ve come up with, apply it to more than a dozen companies and that formula will fail to reflect the stock price within even a 20% accuracy on at least 1 of 12 companies. Tesla stock, share price, whatever you call it is “worth” over $3000 dollars a share PERIOD. If you got in at anytime at any price under $3000 you are safe to hold. So everyone who’s ever bought a single share you made a sound investment decision and don’t let anyone (micheal burry, micheal jordan) say otherwise. Is it true that Tesla “profits” are in the future? Yep you bet! So if you can see that now you are fucking Albert Einstein baby and that market will continue to reflect this sentiment for years to come. Until TESLA hits $3000/share+. This IS financial advice... lol no can’t say that... but to me it is very clear than profits/cash flow/revenue have very little to do with share price. It’s 2021 not 1921."

People want to say Tesla is a tech company we don’t value it like a car company… well when they start selling proprietary systems to other auto makers I’ll be interested at this valuation, but - so far - the only systems that are proprietary aren’t even performing that well on their own cars, certainly years away from anything other automakers would purchase. Not to mention their continued failure to meet timetables, Ford will have F-150 lightnings delivered to dealerships before the CyberTruck hits production it looks like. Burry saw $GME coming, and I think he’s correct on $TSLA.

Obviously he saw what a lot of people in the financial world didn't related to mortgages. Though I think the chances of an interest rate dependent bet coming off are not substantial. The Fed is not going to raise rates no matter what inflation does this year and when they do raise them it will be extremely controlled. 

People jumping all over inflation bets are not thinking long term. Commodity prices are suffering from the same unrealistic PEs as Tesla. They will come down. End user demand growth for commodities is not that great in the physical reality of the world.

The market correcting from funny money PEs in the long run? That's pretty likely. You can only hype, meme, stimulus so long. When it wears off and reality sets in, Tesla isn't worth $500 billion dollars."

2021-05-31 12:08:39,wallstreetbets,"This is faulty. 

Burry is specifically buying puts because he thinks Tesla, at $600B is completely overvalued. He sees that it’s a bunch of fanboys propping up the stock, and when they bubble bursts, it’s going to be mayhem. Is Tesla worth $600B? No. Is it worth $100B? Maybe. But that still makes it much higher than most other car companies. It’s losing market share everywhere and Tesla is doing things that are hurting itself like getting rid of radar. I’ve convinced half a dozen friends to wait on their purchase this year because no radar means that the experience is going to be worse and looking at the reviews, I was right. This is an unforced error on Muskd’s part.

For me, it doesn't make sense that while I'm working full time (and more) creating actual value to the market (as many others), technology continues to give value, and we become more and more effective in our resources allocations and efficiency, and interest rates will rise drastically.

Inflation is only an issue where it has a disproportionate and therefore negative effect.

Burry most definitely saying the price is overbid. Tesla won't achieve results to justify its PE ratio, and the near term for valuation matters more than the long term.

It would have cost have cost him far far less to buy those puts. For the smoothest of brains out there, even if I buy a $1 OTM TSLA FD, the notional value would be 100 x stock price which would be $62400 at the current stock price."
2021-05-31 07:52:18,wallstreetbets,"If I ready Burry right, he's not one of these screaming morons that Tesla's a fraud story and on the verge of bankruptcy. He just thinks the valuation has gotten too high. OK."

2021-05-31 01:19:09,wallstreetbets,"Well yes and no... the capm formula commonly used to find the equity portion of a WACC accounts for the interest rate if the risk free rate is used, which it typically is, but even then due to the market risk premium subtracting the risk free rate, it doesn't impact the WACC in the way one might think.  This is important to note as the equity portion of the WACC far outweighs the debt portion in the majority of modern growth companies.

The main two reasons valuations drop when interest rates go up are cost of projects and cashflow shifts.  

The interest rate is increased by the Fed for the specific reason of pulling cash out of the economy.  Because interest rates go up, investors begin allocating larger portions of their liquid net worths into debt assets as they yield more.  This is the major factor affecting current valuations.  

The second effect is borrowing becomes more costly for companies so their cost of debt goes up.  This in theory would increase the discount rate in turn lowering valuations, but like was explained before, the debt portion of most WACC calculations is very small relative to the equity.  Meaning the effect on the WACC from changing interest rates tends to be fairly negligible across the growth portion of the equities market."

2021-05-31 09:06:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but assuming he just bought 8.001 plain vanilla puts and if he still holds (based on his negative tweets mid-February about Tesla, OI as of now > 8.000, maturity > 6 months as of now (likely he bought LEAPS)), then we can speculate that he bought Jan 2022 350P that spiked in OI from 8k to 13.2k on Feb 17 (VWAP @ $25.5).

This might be completely false (also we don’t know how many shares he’s shorting outright), but if he bought on Feb 17 5k Jan 2022 350P at VWAP and then bought 3k more later at the same price before Mar 31, then his cost was $25.5 x 8.001 x 100 = $20.4m, which is reasonable relative to Scion’s AUM below $1b."

1. People buying Tesla at the beginning of 2020 because they liked Musk
2. Shorts having to cover because these people irrationally bought Tesla
3. Tesla getting added to the S&P500 because it rose so much, forcing every S&P500 fund to pour billions of dollars into Tesla
4. Tesla rises even more because people know that these funds have to put money into Tesla
5. Other people are seeing Tesla rise, buying Tesla shares at 900 Dollars (LOL)

All of these effects are vanishing, which is why Tesla is at about -30% YTD. They are going to continue to fall when people become disillusioned about what they bought. I don't care about the interest rates, Tesla isn't worth 600B Dollars. It just isn't.

2021-05-31 05:08:28,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is a bullshit narrative thrown out by institutional money (and their puppet press) who sold/shorted growth and tech 5 weeks ago *temporarily* because it was high, and is scaring retail to follow so they can jump back in and buy it back at cheap prices. Tech has practically corrected now and may have even bottomed. You'll also notice bond rates going up (another scare tactic) is no more. It's like this past week that narrative just went away.

I'm fully expecting big money to jump back into tech and ride it back up because the reality is inflation or not you want to own companies that run the market/society. You aren't going to dump a company which will run the world in the coming decades because borrowing rates went up slightly. We aren't even talking about big increases and even still I doubt the fed does it. They're gonna let inflation run hot before they turn off the liquidity and force the economy to deleverage (recession).

That's yet another bullshit fake-out because all their helicopter money can't stimulate shit. Like injecting fentanyl in a heroin patient with a high tolerance, at this point the liquidity just prevents a serious come down, it's not actually creating inflationary growth. If we do get inflation it'll be stagflation. But most likely it's just business as usual where the only inflation you'll see is in assets where most of the helicopter money lands. Thus the wealth gap grows. But it keeps Wallstreet happy and SPY going up. It'll also make money for people here.

On the other hand, who knows what Ford is doing now, except DD freaks?   
Ford is boring, right?  ask folk in the street ""what is Ford doing?"" .. <<er uh duh making cars. making ELECTRIC cars, self drive, whatever ??>>

2021-05-31 09:33:52,wallstreetbets,I’ve been musing on this for a while. My reading is that Tesla is now overpriced when you consider traditional car makers are making massive inroads into Tesla space and have the manufacturing to put out a quality product considerably quicker and cheaper. VW Group are clearly capable of making a Tesla redundant in the next few years.

Nearly every equity analysis desk on the street values companies by discounting 10-15 years of intensive FCF projections of companies to the present.  And then applying a terminal growth rate after that. Both of these can be very sensitive to the discount rate / WACC. 

I was with you until your last sentence claiming “Meaning the effect on the WACC from changing interest rates tends to be fairly negligible across the growth portion of the equities market”.  It’s definitely sensitive to the WACC you use. All else equal, raising the discount rate of a company from say 8% -> 10% will make a significant change in the valuation of an asset."

2021-05-31 05:34:47,wallstreetbets,"I'm of the opinion that Tesla is a great company already, it's an amazing story of success and growth. In the future they will likely be very successful and very profitable.

But like I say, even with those assumptions, the stock price doesn't make sense. Unless they take a total monopoly on the auto market, it just doesn't make any sense.

The biggest issue for me is frankly that the auto industry is shrinking, not expanding. As populations continue to urbanise, cars are simply less important and less useful. The future of transport is rail and bus, not private motor cars. Even if we say they get a monopoly on ridiculous concepts like robotaxis, we're admitting that fewer vehicles will need to exist.

For those reasons, it doesn't make sense that Tesla today is valued higher than the rest of the auto industry."

Basically the entire power grid has to be rebuilt to fix this, in addition to building new power plants to handle the demand.

All of this on top of the problems with battery technology. We've been working on batteries for almost 150 years at this point and have yet to make a significant breakthrough. Electricity likes to move, not sit. We may never see electric vehicles with range comparable to ICE."

2021-05-31 07:43:11,wallstreetbets,"All the other companies are making much fewer EVs. The ironic thing is that on Tesla’s way up people kept talking about how other manufacturers make more cars, but now that Tesla has capacity for 1 million cars per year this year (and 2-3 million starting next year) that argument has gotten much quieter. Meanwhile the Fords and GMs are in the tens of thousands or low hundred thousands for several years at least. The EVs are much higher margin than ICE are for the traditional automakers so it’s not a good comparison. 

Besides that^ somewhat obvious point, Tesla also has much more software revenue (much of which hasn’t been realized yet) as well as an energy business that is growing rapidly (solar, home storage batteries, grid storage batteries, etc). Lastly Tesla has unique partnerships/relationships that give them unique advantages in materials, technologies, opportunities, etc such as SpaceX, Boring Company, etc. The steel alloy used in the gigapresses was developed in tandem with SpaceX so it’s not easy for other companies to replicate with undoing the majority of their manufacturing approach.

2021-05-31 09:41:30,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I think it will come down to Tesla’s advantages vs. legacy auto makers’ advantages. Tesla’s biggest immediate advantages are software and batteries. If Tesla can maintain a meaningful lead in software (battery/energy management and vehicle body functions), they should at least have some higher-end market. As far as batteries, my understanding is that no other auto makers have Tesla’s production capability, and so they may have to buy batteries from Tesla to quickly ramp up EV production. 

Tesla also doesn’t have the huge sunk costs that traditional OEMs have in engines and transmissions and their development/production, nor does it face the difficulty of transitioning away from those technologies, which includes shedding a lot of their most talented engineers.

Tesla’s biggest weaknesses are its inexperience in auto assembly, and lack of a national maintenance/service infrastructure. Making high-quality cars consistently at the level of Toyota and Honda is hard, just ask Chrysler. And although EVs are much simpler and less Murph-oid than ICE vehicles, windows, trunks and other mechanical parts will break. If their service capacity does not scale with sales volume, it could be a bottleneck."

Obviously besides all this they make a fun, fast, reliable, and safe car that is reasonably priced. 

There is plenty more, but they have a lot going for them, and if they're able to execute then Tesla might just be absolutely massive in the future.

Other companies, like Porsche, may just opt buy batteries from Tesla instead of trying to design and manufacture their own. Porsch reliability does rank higher than Tesla, Tesla says a lot of the reported problems are with features other cars don’t have and say their cars are thus more reliable than ratings reveal... consumers will be the judge on that 🤷.

One of the first questions you have to ask if you are buying an EV is where am I going to charge it on a road trip. Tesla has a massive charging network and the cars have software that helps you plan your trips around their chargers. Other EV makers? Nothing like it. Audi, Ford, etc make you rely on a patchwork of chargers maintained by other companies. Tesla has built out its own charging infrastructure to eliminate range anxiety. Other EV makers have not. Range anxiety is a top concern among people considering buying EVs, and with Tesla, there is none. That’s a huge moat."

EV is nothing like oil engine tranport, you cant just flick a switch, so much so that it's a different planet. And they will have to cater to both for a long time, EV and oil based, which makes it harder."

Would be Beyond Damn Stupid for GM to STOP selling conventional transport to the whole of the USA suddenly right now wouldn't it? - all that HUGE BUSINESS  -  just to concentrate on today's EV minority market, wouldn't it? Because today EV is still a *minority market*, as you KNOW.   
GM would lose a HELL of a lot of money if they scrapped all their conventional output - and most  American citizens at the moment might be pissed off about having NO CARS?

So what is the GM **front page** about? - A range of 30+ electric vehicles in the next 4 years.

If ten years from now every car in the USA is electric, what percentage of those will be GM or Ford and what percentage will be Tesla?  Because that's what GM and Ford are tooling up for. They don't aim to be shutting down their massive car production  at all."

I just typed in ""Ford EV"" and these were literally the first off the list. Ford had this stuff set up last year ... I didn't even look at the rest but you can find plenty. Their technical info & research & deals with specialist IT is interesting if you can be bothered. . Since Jan I was DDing and comparing US & European & Asian advances in EV & self-drive. Do the same.  
GM aims for a range of 30 EVs in the next 4-5 years.Look around."
2021-05-31 08:09:47,wallstreetbets,"Ford will only be able to make about 75k or so F-150 EVs in 2022 given the size of the factory they allotted and the ramp rate of the Mach E (only 15k in all of Q1 2021). 

Tesla will be making probably 100k-250k in 2022 since the Austin gigafactory should have a capacity of 500k-1M initially and they are mostly making Model Y and CT there."
2021-05-31 09:13:44,wallstreetbets,"Again, this is an Apple v Microsoft situation. The Ford looks nice, but kinda boring (the 90k version is insane though). The cyber truck is different, innovative, and the base model is not for business (like Ford). I want a cyber truck but am happy there is competition. I assume Ford will be selling the truck at or near cost while I am pretty sure Tesla will be making a fatter profit due to how the panels are cut, etc. I am impressed with the innovations Ford has made however (turn knob on touch screen, etc) so should be fun!"
2021-05-31 06:40:09,wallstreetbets,"Not cheaper.

Less features for same price. 52k F150L comparable to 40k CT."
2021-05-31 09:03:55,wallstreetbets,"Cyber truck starts at under 40k (theoretically, steel prices keep going up). Lightning is $41,500.  And the base cybertruck has ** more than double the range** and cab space for 6. You're gonna spend a lot more on the F150 to try to get comparable specs and you're still gonna be missing 200 miles of range.

I think aesthetics will mostly drive people's choice between the two, but there's no question the Cybertruck offers way better value and better engineering. Ford will never compete on range because they just took a regular f150, changed the engine, and made the gas tank a battery. This limits battery size.  Because Tesla never worked off existing designs, they built ground-up electric.  The entire car is built on top of the battery.   Ford would have to start fresh to have nearly as much space for battery."

How in five years is that possible? 

Plus consider the collector and legacy markets. No one is in danger of holding an ICE bag any time soon. That's the equivalent of saying there are railroad bag holders because of semis. Things will evolve but I don't see a bottom to fall out. That's my rub and lack of market knowledge in regards to that part.

Those are some examples. Some other aspects are how far ahead they are with battery technology and their investment in superchargers.  You can charge from 20-80% in about 10-15 minutes and be on your way.  There are something like 10k of those chargers worldwide, most of which are in the US and Europe.  

Also, the cars are designed ground-up as an EV, not retrofitted from existing platforms.  This is why they are the safest cars ever made.  The entire front end is a crumple zone and thousands of times per second the car is evaluating weight distribution across the seats to adjust how airbags will react to maximize safety.  The safety ratings have to be changed because their cars have received perfect scores in all categories and sub categories.

Unfortunately it's hard to predict long term what that means, as Tesla, Audi and Porsche are all on both sides of that equation. Model 3 has been plagued with service issues over here, but so has the Audi. My Model 3 got attacked by rodents over winter, but VW used wheat-based plastic for their wiring looms so I'm glad I didn't go for an e-Golf.

Another example is Model 3 vs Mach-e, where the Ford scores just about 99% vs the Tesla on all characteristics (lower power, shorter range, smaller trailer, worse acceleration etc, but REALLY close actually). People still buy them, though. Names are powerful.

Personally I would think Tesla is a bit over valued right now. With a few minor decision done right, Ford could actually beat them.

That charging network is ace, though. In practice, Tesla charges about half of any competitor. Which SOUNDS really bad, but in practice wouldn't have been a big issue for most people, as much of the point of owning an EV is to charge at home or at work. For that summer holiday I wouldn't have been severely impacted by a few tens of dollars worth of charging fees, but seeing it in writing gives a bit of a sticker shock.

In norwegian, but scroll to the bottom and compare the prices (some charge per minute, some per kWh and some both. Lynlading==150kw+, hurtiglading means 50-150kW):

[https://elbil.no/lading/hurtiglading/](https://elbil.no/lading/hurtiglading/)

Tesla got all the hype being a 100% ev company from the start, but the hype may well fade. I strongly believe that raw material shortages, recyclability and repairability issues in the industry will get more attention, in this space I don't see a leader atm. Autopilot is a joker though.

They’ll get there but they’ll be the smaller manufacturers compared to Tesla once it’s a fully EV market closer to 2030/2035. Tesla also has the lowest net debt position out of the major automakers so they have a cash advantage as well.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/541390/global-sales-of-plug-in-electric-vehicle-manufacturers/

By the time GM, Ford, etc are able to make 1M EVs per year, Tesla will be able to make 5M or more. It’s a trend that will continue given Tesla’s time/cash/focus advantage. So if Tesla is making 20M per year by 2030 then most of traditional auto will probably be in the 5M-10M range."

So all that matters is how many units they sell. 

I'm also not looking at current figures and making this judgement. If they eclipse Toyota in terms of production, which would be a massive success, they'd still have to sell as many units as the next 4 largest manufacturers on top of that for their valuation to make sense.

> Some other aspects are how far ahead they are with battery technology

They're not necessarily ahead in battery technology, they have contracts with battery manufacturers. They've been focusing on range as their primary competitive advantage, but competitors haven't bothered with supplying more costly batteries since EV consumers don't seem to care about range beyond 200km.

> superchargers

Supercharging degrades the battery, reducing the lifespan of the battery. That's the unfortunate truth. Increasing charge speed in competing products isn't impossible, they simply haven't taken that strategy. I speculate that Tesla is pushing the supercharging to sell cars fast, and take the market share aggressively. I foresee unhappy owners complaining about the degraded batteries 2-3 years from now. This is basic stuff, the same things happened with phones for years.

>  There are games, movie platforms, driving visualization, voice control (of almost all car functions), Google Maps integration, built in sentry mode utilizing all 8 cameras and dash cam. Camping mode, hilarious Easter eggs...

Ok, nobody is really buying a car to play games. Movie platforms? Loads of cars have had netflix for quite a while. Google maps, definitely not unique to Tesla. Security cameras & dashcams are pretty basic for new luxury cars today. Easter eggs? Come on, nobody is buying a car for le ebin memes. Voice control is not new.

Look, I'm not saying that Teslas are bad cars, I agree they're good cars that people want to own. I am not arguing that. I am simply arguing that they do not have a huge lead on their competitors, they've got better range (for now) and charge faster (for now). But the fact is that most charging stations are going to be government funded, and gubiment aint going to pay for a Tesla proprietary charger unless they share their tech with their competitors.

> Oh, and did I almost forget that they handle better and are faster than everything else?

2021-05-31 14:40:20,wallstreetbets,"2019 was one of the largest years ever for auto auctions. 2020 screwed to much for me judge anything. Classic cars get younger every year. You are correct there are fewer C2 vettes and such, miatas, mustangs etc are becoming classic every year. That doesn't go away it grows at the same curve of production overall. Classic cars change some become collectors some don't. 

I've been hearing about battery improvements since highschool shop. The one that will make easy charging and longer trips just around the corner. The fall of air travel means increase in road travel. That's why infrastructure matters. Almost no one will buy an EV as a daily just to replace a working ICE. When the ICE dies, then maybe, if they are better and cheaper than a new or used good reliable ICE.

No working on one from home isn't necessary but ahuge part of the automotive market and your talking a market switch to a new tech. It matters. Nit to mention either training or retraining ICE techs and mechanics to EV techs and mechanics. That matters. Trying welding body work on a Tesla without proper training, lots of entertainment on YouTube. Retraining a workforce takes time, even longer with a currently advancing technology. 

Overall it's your money and your theory. I just think most investors don't consider the actual market for ICE.
 They get wrapped around the axle and judge only on balance sheets of the big four. Things won't, and can't move fast enough to change to a new conveyance as quickly as most bullish investors keep saying. There are huge profits to be made in the space on individual companies but it gets conflated. Tesla doing well and big four doing not as well does not equal the end of ICE or a take over by EV. NIO is a safe bet based on their tech, Dodge might be good too. Depends on what they do and how they adapt. 

Just saying, don't bet farm in ICE dying."

To justify that price, I'd have to take a long term look at roadmap, R&D edge and trajectory, etc into account and assume they will continue to execute and progress successfully.

If they can mature FSD to the point where their vehicles can be used as robo taxis, I think they can ~10x by 2030 (accounting for some anticipated inflation as well).  If they can't, their market cap will likely fall closer in line with other car manufacturers."

So what? My point is that many consumers are happy with the electric cars they've bought, which were cheaper than Teslas and met their needs.

As for the rest of your post, you just sound like a fanboy. ""MY CAR COMPANY MAKES THE BEEEST CARS EVERY OTHER EV SUCKS111!!!"" Just listen to yourself, have you driven in every single electric vehicle on the market? Have you even read about Audi's driver assist tech, or are you another cultist who ignores the competition?

If I was to take your bizarre fanboy delusion as fact (which I don't, lots of people are very happy with their non-Tesla EVs), we're left with a statement that says ""Tesla is the gold standard"". Take a look outside, does everyone drive a BMW? Do they drive Porsches and brand new Mercedes Benz's? Do they all drive Bentleys?

Fuck no, about a third drive the cheapest piece of shit they can get, the next third buy something in the middle like a pre-owned Ford, and then a third get something fancy like a new Range Rover.

Does your investment decision rely on the prediction that suddenly the whole world will say ""I'M ONLY GOING TO BUY A TOP OF THE LINE TESLA, NOTHING INFERIOR FOR ME, ONLY THE BEST, AND I WILL PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR IT"".

To summarise:

* No, Teslas are not ""objectively"" the best EVs, ""best car"" is a matter of opinion, and lots of people are happy with their Audis.

* People are perfectly happy to buy cheaper cars. We're not all consoooooomers, some of us just want to reliably get from A->B in a comfy chair."

2021-05-31 13:43:14,wallstreetbets,"That's incorrect. From what I can see Tesla has around 19,000 installed charging stations where Chargepoint is over 136,000 installed. Chargepoint also offers more DC fast chargers (comparable to the Tesla ""super charger"").  You were probably referring to the level 2 chargers which take around 5-6 hours to charge from empty. Level 2 is much more common and a better option for usual charging  as the quick chargers degrade the battery packs more quickly. 

The thing is, driving and charging an EV is much different than a gas car. I never worry about where I'm going to charge because I charge at night. It's not like a gas vehicle where you can only fill up at a gas station."

Waymo actually handles city driving already.   Tesla is basically highway and suburbs only. Unless there construction zones (but Waymo also fails at construction zones).   Tesla just has a long way to go and after years of insisting they didn't need LIDAR it's curious that they're suddenly looking to make a deal to add it to their cars.

2021-05-31 06:47:06,wallstreetbets,"I've explained this elsewhere. Software platforms have a monoculture effect.

Platform A becomes popular, so developers are more likely to make software for platform A. Consumers want that software, so they buy the platform that supports it. Hence newer companies have an uphill battle developing a new platform.

This is why severs are all Unix, and office computers are all Windows. Apple has only recently taken significant PC/Laptop market share because webapps have shifted the platform dependency to browsers instead of hosts.

When you buy a phone, you have two options, android or iphone. It's a monoculture effect that's hard to displace. Android went for the mass market, whereas apple took over the premium-""I'm rich"" segment.

Can Tesla do the same? Sure, but so can Porsche, BMW, and Ferrari. There won't be any barriers to entry like smartphones, there's no monoculture effect, no feedback-loop that enforces an oligopoly.


For these reasons, using Apple's story to justify Tesla's value today is inappropriate and misguided."

But selling cars is a pretty traditional market, it takes way longer to scale and there is way more smart, funded competition. Let's say they usurp Toyota and are selling 25 million cars a year. Thats a massive success and huge market share in that industry. And yet they will still be tens of millions of cars short of hitting the kinds of profits they would need to be worth their current valuation.

So good luck with your pipe dream, but despite the facade, Tesla is a car company, not an easily scalable silocon valley tech company breaking into a wide open market."

The idea that software updates for cars is a unique advantage they have is just wrong. Cars have been using digital control systems for a long time now, and the infotainment stuff is a matter of ""why"" rather than ""how"".

Tesla has one thing going for it: Range. That's about it. Sooner or later the competitors will beat them on range, and the stock will tank faster than the Tesla Model S can go from 0-60."

This is when you want to drive somewhere that’s far away. Perhaps using self driving. 

Chargepoint’s DC fast chargers aren’t as fast as Tesla superchargers. Those chargers are also available to Tesla drivers but everyone uses the Tesla ones because chargepoint takes days. 

Chargepoint only has 250Vdc “fast charging”.. it is a technology limitation. 

Their website clearly states “up to 80mi of range in 30 minutes”… Tesla’s V3 chargers can deliver 250+miles of range in the same 30 minutes. 

I’m also long CHPT, since it’s the best option everyone that’s buys any other EV is going to have, but if you don’t see charging as one of Tesla’s top advantages you just have confirmation bias."

If I’m by myself and want to do the sub 5 minute stop where I just gas up and piss, then yeah electric loses every time.

All that being said, '22 calls are rather expensive.

As all the TV channels has their streaming and several free streaming service like Crackle, Pluto, Tubi etc. Disney gone, Breaking bad on AMC+, Sons o Anarchy on FX/hulu and the list goes on. I just don't see them staying in the long run if something doesn't change drastically."

2021-05-31 16:36:14,wallstreetbets,"Netflix might be getting into gaming I heard. For that reason, I'm out. I also thought about puts on netflix a while back cause they definitely suck and are getting squashed."
2021-05-31 17:48:39,wallstreetbets,"Two words: Thunder Force.  They're spending tens of billions on content that won't age well.  With MGM you acquire James Bond, Rocky, etc.  Older content and potentially new IPs.  I can't think of anything I want to watch again that's Netflix IP, now it's getting close to not watching even once.  It's about filling quotas first, entertainment last.  Their not trying to create some valuable assets that will stand the test of time by being actually entertaining.

VIAC just had a 50 million dollar opening weekend hit with A Quiet Place 2.  Tons of since the 50's that their getting license fee from, and they're still milking that classic content with Mission Impossible and Top Gun sequels coming out.

If you look at the Nielsen's streaming ratings, Netflix most viewed shows, aren't their own.  It's shows like NCIS and Grey's anatomy.  And soon those licenses will expire and go to VIAC and Peacock services.

And with last earnings, subscriber count is slowing down and I think it will eventually subtract. I predict Netflix is going under 300 by 2023."
2021-05-31 18:48:58,wallstreetbets,"I personally would not buy puts in Netflix.  They’re expanding their market share and producing some highly popular shows.  

My opinion about the company itself is immaterial.  I believe they’re going to expand their market niche with the in-house shows they’ve been doing.  They’re well done and Netflix is likely going to be in a better negotiating position for other content when they can do as good or better with their in house stuff.

I see them changing major networks/HBO/etc at their own game.  

I could be wrong, I’m not an expert here, but I just don’t see Netflix tanking."
2021-05-30 22:51:01,wallstreetbets,"I have been thinking about it for a while, their FCF and subscriber growth cannot be sustainable. Their debt load is enormous and cannot complete with the likes of AMZN or DIS in the long run. Once rates start to raise in 2022, their share price will go down significantly."
2021-05-30 23:35:45,wallstreetbets,Amazon overpaid for MGM but they desperately need to paid their service with content and this will allow them to do that and stay competetive. To be honest I wouldn't be surprised if Amazon is making a bid to own some theaters. Not only would you have every arm of the movie business but you could leverage those large retail spaces and parking lots for other areas of your business & logistics & event planning.

2021-05-31 07:38:03,wallstreetbets,"Just because Netflix wants to get into gaming doesn't mean they will be successful. See: Google and Stadia

IMO Netflix is downhill from here as they get cornered out of a lot of big IPs from Amazon (whose Prime is less about streaming and more about a whole package), HBO, and Disney. They have some good originals, but original content costs a lot more than the crap Disney can churn out and make bank on and be guaranteed a win. Gaming is a tough sector for streaming platforms because we are still IMO 10 years away from game streaming and it not sucking, and even then I think the audience is casual gamers and anyone halfway serious will prefer native devices."

Their whole business model relies on volume and lately churning out Uber crappy content. They’ve raised prices on subscribers and want to cut down on sharing accounts which could be like free marketing in some ways for them. They need another hit and they aren’t producing it right now. 

The only reason they aren’t tanking is bc Disney is sucking right now too, and Att is a terrible company that can’t manage anything. 

Once a real competitor comes along they’ll get wiped out but that’s if they can’t get back on their feet before then."

If people are expecting the stock to go down or stay flat (which everyone is), you are going to have a hard time making money off it

EDIT: I mean betting with the market is far safer but typically offers fewer gains than betting against the market. Betting against the market is far more profitable and risky and is the WSB MO."

2021-05-31 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Limitations of a Fugazi In recent times the idea has become popular that some people know how the market will behave in the future based on technical analysis or “DD”. Ultimately, the modern essence of financial markets is that those who have people believing that their predictions or statements about the market are correct, are the influencers. In some cases influencers can create enough following that they have the ability to influence the market because they influence PEOPLE following them. Therein lies the key to understanding how markets move, and I’m not talking about understanding the influencer; I’m talking about understanding people. The market is driven by the aggregate of traders who make decisions constantly throughout market hours. Some traders are just individuals, some are in the form of large institutions; both are just a piece of the market made up of people. So if you believe that someone can accurately tell you what the entire population of investors on the market will do, then you’d believe that it is possible to predict the market. However, I’d like to just say that if some individual actually knew how to predict the market so well; then they’d be the richest person on earth, yet that isn’t the case nor remotely near it in fact. 

Remember that at the end of the day anyone who thinks that they know everything about the market, probably knows a lot less than someone who can admit that they have a limited knowledge of what the market will do."

2021-05-31 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BYND The case for BYND

Improving fundamentals: It just received a double upgrade and now has two consecutive analyst upgrades. The total addressable market for BYND is potentially in the trillions of dollars: displacing animal-based beef, pork, eggs, cheese, and chicken. The World Economic Forum has argued that global meat consumption must fall within the coming years. According to Forbes, 60% of Gen Z is looking to base their diets on “plant-forward” foods. 

BYND market cap’s only $10 billion. It’s growing like a weed. Yearly revenue growth for the past three is 131% compounded annually.  

And BYND might have a durable competitive advantage. According to analyst Alexia Howard, for BYND, “as plant-based products tend to be relatively complex to manufacture, moats could prove to be deep.” Additionally, as of 2019, the company had one patent and 21 U.S. and international patent applications.  

It’s attempting to achieve price parity with animal-based meat in the next few years and ultimately even produce for cheaper. As the first-mover, it also has the potential to achieve economies of scale faster and become most attractive from a price standpoint. Its competitor Impossible Burger has had to turn down partnerships because it hasn’t had the infrastructure that BYND has and couldn’t produce sufficient product to service big partnerships. BYND’s further along and has been able to garner partnerships with the likes of KFC, McDonald’s, Starbucks, Pepsi, Pizza Hut. Impossible Burger also produces its food with GMOs, which are outlawed in many countries. BYND already sells products in 80 countries.  

Remember that the GME run started in 2020 with not only high short interest but attractiveness from a fundamental perspective that led big investors like Michael Burry and Ryan Cohen to move in aggressively. BYND has this fundamental attractiveness more than a lot of companies with a high short interest, which analysts are largely downrating.  

BYND’s growth took more of a pandemic-related hit than other food providers because much of its growth involves people buying their products in restaurants. It is, therefore, considered a re-opening play. 

BYND spends 7% of revenue on R&D, which is many times that of more mature food providers, so the future looks bright. 

High short interest: According to both MarketWatch and Ortex, BYND’s short interest is higher than AMC, BB, and GME. 

Favorable externalities: Good against global warming, good for animals, good for global resources, good for human health. This gives incentives to many influentials (celebrities, governments) to encourage people to consume plant-based meat. Governments have subsidized the electric vehicle industry. Will they do the same for clean meat?  

Cramer has suggested BYND as a WSB play to his 250,000 viewers during each of his last three Mad Money episodes (Tues, Weds, Thurs; no show Fri) and elsewhere on CNBC. A couple people here have suggested Cramer has done so as a distraction. I understand the bitterness toward hedge funds: They’re selling out, making a lot of money while not adding much to society. But Cramer’s offering insight to nonprofessional investors to help them make investing decisions. I just started watching Cramer again about a month ago and just about everything he’s liked most has moved up in value: Roblox, Ford, Wells Fargo. He has, in the past, consistently said favorable things about BYND and Ethan Brown. He’s even suggested in the past that going against BYND is going against history. 

And anyway, the proof is in the pudding: BYND short interest is higher than AMC, BB, and GME, according to MarketWatch and Ortex. And it would be a lot nicer for a company displacing animal meat to sell stock and get more capital for R&D than a cell phone or a movie theater company. 

I was following the market in 2013, and this situation reminds me so much of Tesla in May 2013. The stock started rising on fundamentals, and commentators thought it was highly priced and thought it was rising only due to a short squeeze. But electric vehicles were the future and Tesla kept rising for years, even though there was concern that big players would get into the industry. Beyond Meat is also the future and has the potential to rise even after the short squeeze, which is one reason institutional investors may be buying. BYND’s market cap of about $10 billion is also the same as Tesla’s when its run started in 2013 and commentators were scoffing at its valuation. Now it’s over $600 billion. 

This stock right now is potentially set up for a  strong run within the next few months: increasing bullishness of institutional investors, high short interest, and maybe the increasing support of WSB. It’s 40% below its all-time high. I wouldn’t be surprised if it doubles in the next several months.  

Disclaimer: I’m not in any other squeeze plays. I will probably write covered calls on AMC and hedge with puts because their short-term calls are very highly priced. (This is a delta-neutral position that should not impact AMC share price.) I have BYND calls and may buy more because their short-term calls are still cheap."

2021-05-30 22:58:45,wallstreetbets,"Good DD, brother. I'd just like to add that in a similar fashion to TSLA, BYND has a leg up in their competitors (TSLA's level of innovation is well ahead of other EV companies) and they've targeted the Chinese market [via SBUX](https://stories.starbucks.com/asia/stories/2020/starbucks-expands-plant-based-ingredients-and-products-in-china/). Obviously, China is a huge market and the Chinese are rather interested in plant-based meat. 

BYND is def a long reopen play and I'm planning on jumping in right after I play some squeezes first."
2021-05-31 13:01:00,wallstreetbets,"I've been holding for almost 2 years. Bought at $108 and watched it go to $200, then back down to the $90's. Still holding... I am confident in the long-term growth of this Company."

Would be buying more if I had more money. If one of my other plays makes a big move soon, I'll get out and put more in another BYND dip. Not investment advice.

2021-05-31 00:30:41,wallstreetbets,"Buy shares at this price and some ITM calls for a later date. I’ve come to learn that stocks in our “meme” category as manipulated to fleece money from retail on option yolos. You essentially can’t lose money if you keep buying the shares and plan to exercise a few deeper ITM calls in 3 months. Buy a few and sell them down the line for a profit to have the liquidity to exercise the remaining. 

BB is a Great long term investment. 23/24 largest auto manufacturers will use QNX. That’s so bullish nothing else needs to be said. 

I have $7C’s and sure the premium might be a little more expensive right now but I guarantee I will not regret this come sept/oct as I sell a few of them for profit to exercise 3. 

Nxt 3 months also gives me time to save liquidity to exercise. And then go into future BB with a few hundred shares"

2021-05-31 17:46:02,wallstreetbets,Que esperas para mañana martes
2021-05-30 20:51:22,wallstreetbets,"The volume was absolutely ridiculous Friday, and it *still* almost finished flat. Even with the options activity, we won't see another spike like that until the week of earnings. I think next week will dip pretty hard, then slow climb until the week of the 24th. Go all in on calls when they get cheaper, because earnings will be a beat and there's lots of hype around patent sales (some 30k patents exist and there were an undefined number being sold around last ER that weren't able to be included/disclosed). Don't hold through earnings, unless you want to go long on $rope. 


I get the hype for next week, but lots of bagholders dumped shares on the next group early Friday. This also happened last time there was a spike, almost exactly the same way. Guess what happened (or just go look at the chart from January to the week before last). The *only* reason I think next month will rip is because upcoming earnings might actually be good. The following one won't, unless they spread out patent sales until IVY comes around and starts getting subscriptions, which will dilute earnings a bit each time. $BB is not a great sentiment stock; they're outperformed in that sense by a company that was a month away from bankruptcy back in January, and not far off pre-covid. Fundamentally, they're a ""dying company"" that is losing money, but their pivot play is what gives them future value.

Edit: I missed the fact that this be a bagholders meeting. Looking at people's very specific price targets, and current cost basis, it's not hard to imagine why you all think people should buy this with reckless abandon and hope it'll continue to soar."

AMC and GME wasn't on the top stocks being shorted during their short squeeze, BB isn't one of the top stocks being shorted. TD Ameritrade shows 9% short interest for BB. How are these in a short squeeze and not WKHS which is 41% float shorted??

2021-05-31 10:41:55,wallstreetbets,"It’s mostly OG retard’s vs the influx of new, true, retards that GME brought here. Totally different demographics."
2021-05-31 17:14:10,wallstreetbets,I have both gme and BB. The 500k floor gme isn't dumb if you read all the DD. BUT I think only the minority of shares will sell for these high numbers (right before liquidity issues interfere with trading). I think everyone else would sell for 10k to 50k
2021-05-30 21:38:37,wallstreetbets," 
Jumped out of stage one bottom imo. Need 9.50-10 support to hold. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕🌕 look at bullish pt if playing 6/4 imo. Could see upwards of 24+ tho if we indeed squeeze."

2021-05-30 23:13:56,wallstreetbets,What other stocks other than bb gme and amc are people here investing in? Ive gone all in on BB but wonder what other plays are out there

2021-05-30 21:23:37,wallstreetbets,How do you access Canadian markets?
2021-05-31 00:07:58,wallstreetbets,I've got 500. Might buy more tomorrow if it Dips
2021-05-31 09:55:11,wallstreetbets,Why wait? Buy $BB.to on the TSX!
2021-05-30 20:06:25,wallstreetbets,Your #1 = 🤦🏽‍♂️
2021-05-31 01:35:11,wallstreetbets,"You have any options?  20K at $9.90 here. (that includes buys at $18, $16 and $13 that really moved my average up).  Got my first 500 shares in 2013 at $14/share (brought wayyyy to early, as usual).  Pretty much my entire portfolio outside of my work 401K is in BB now.  Just what they say not to do.  Recently dipped into options....  purchased 5 Sept 21 10 Calls  at $1.93 ea.   They doubled Friday, now back to even!"
2021-05-31 16:14:55,wallstreetbets,So your saying play it tomorrow get out before the dump and reinvest in gme/amc?
2021-05-30 23:01:30,wallstreetbets,"I run BB.TO so I'm personally getting options for the 18th because the 25th is empty currently. 

I wanted to buy 25th as well to play earnings as well. Although it would be dangerous because I've heard volatility crush absolutely wrecks options of they expire the week of earnings."
2021-05-30 21:11:16,wallstreetbets,Nothing wrong IMO. Just 6/18 sticks out on the charts.
2021-05-31 16:00:58,wallstreetbets,Be careful with calls. If you don’t understand options.
2021-05-31 09:43:51,wallstreetbets,Man on the 🌝
2021-05-31 16:00:09,wallstreetbets,Like CLF for the long run? Seems like it has been gaining strength.
2021-05-30 23:15:14,wallstreetbets,how high you think it can go and are you holding long term?
2021-05-31 09:22:38,wallstreetbets,I really think federal legalization might this time around
2021-05-31 16:03:38,wallstreetbets,"Don’t risk more than you can lose. Avoid calls so you don’t risk losing everything. Maybe average in. Not financial advice.

2021-05-31 09:41:19,wallstreetbets,Noice!!
2021-05-31 09:23:35,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-30 20:41:50,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I’d like to see what the data says on Tuesday to see if sellers come in. Flows do look extremely bullish and some whales have entered. We shall see what this week brings.
2021-05-31 02:10:45,wallstreetbets,wasn't 11 like the peak on friday?
2021-05-31 16:05:37,wallstreetbets,"Agreed a chance to get out. Hopefully, people have dry powder."

2021-05-30 22:35:57,wallstreetbets,None I’m new to this and tired of all the bs in the world and want to stick it to the ones that tell us what to do
2021-05-31 09:43:16,wallstreetbets,They were a week ago
2021-05-31 11:30:37,wallstreetbets,Thanks friend.
2021-05-30 23:02:30,wallstreetbets,Yeah next earnings is most likely not going to be good based on what Chen said last meeting thingy
2021-05-31 01:39:09,wallstreetbets,So you believe BB will drop this coming week? Was considering buying on market open do you think wait? I’m pretty new at this....
2021-05-31 01:58:04,wallstreetbets,Blackberry isn’t a dying company it generates free cash flow you have no idea what you’re talking about
2021-05-31 09:25:30,wallstreetbets,Can you explain to me when you are saying to buy and short it and buy again.  Sorry doesn’t make sense to me.  I’m new to this and don’t want to make the wrong move tomorrow.  Thanks and you both rocked your points going back and forth
2021-05-30 23:57:50,wallstreetbets,"They'd short BB more at the hundred or so it'd reach, wait a week for sentiments to drop as people here take profit, then buy back at 15. Probably make an anon account to call us all bagholders.   


Literally what I'd be doing Tuesday with AMC if I was a rich asshole instead of just an asshole"
2021-05-31 09:42:57,wallstreetbets,Don’t you put that evil on me.
2021-05-31 10:20:13,wallstreetbets,Selling puts. Yes.
2021-05-30 22:48:00,wallstreetbets,Sell kidney. Buy bb.
2021-05-30 23:03:29,wallstreetbets,"Buy shares, 10 is good price, but it may dip more this week"
2021-05-30 23:04:09,wallstreetbets,I’m buying more shares at open but saving money for if it dips this week
2021-05-31 01:01:13,wallstreetbets,It's a tough call but I'd probably do a small buy at open and wait for a dip 30 minutes in to buy more. When there is a ton of interest overnight usually the open price shoots up followed by a short ladder/correction within the first hour. The risk of this strategy is it may soar and keep on ripping up. Good luck with whatever you decide.

Some people lost 75 percent on BB calls they bought Friday at the peak. Be careful. Read the doc and I have a guide for newbies linked in the doc. 

Don’t get caught up with fomo. Ease in. If you don’t make money here make it on the next stock. But getting blown out early in your trading career leaves a bitter taste. Learn the skills to do this long term. Please be careful.

Do shares over calls if you have to buy BB. BB is at least a real company for the long term."
2021-05-30 21:34:00,wallstreetbets,This ape just poured their heart out with fancy charts and big words and you have the nerve to talk about a different stock...

2021-05-31 13:19:44,wallstreetbets,"I think short sellers are covering today.

TSX is open. And it's a great opportunity for the short devils to cover in the Canadian market, and sell during the dip on Tuesday. This way, shorts will trigger a stop loss from people and cause a ladder attack, and cover their positions."
2021-05-31 10:03:14,wallstreetbets,Why not today?!?!
2021-05-31 13:13:08,wallstreetbets,this is the way

2021-05-31 00:00:03,wallstreetbets,Realistically in the near term? Probably 20-30.
2021-05-30 22:55:07,wallstreetbets,And they don’t expire and are currently at a GREAT price
2021-05-30 22:55:33,wallstreetbets,"Eh buying a call can force a market maker to buy shares to hedge which would also result in shares being bought and helping the price. 

That's the assumption that you're buying a call from a MM though"
2021-05-31 02:22:43,wallstreetbets,Go look up delta-gamma hedging. Then go look up how market makers make money doing it. Now shut the fuck up and stop talking like you know what you're doing.
2021-05-31 09:42:48,wallstreetbets,"do both, buying shares reduces supply and calls that go itm increase demand for 100 shares"
2021-05-31 10:36:34,wallstreetbets,Buying calls does usually cause institutions to buy shares to hedge their position.  They don’t necessarily buy 100 per call but they buy some.
2021-05-31 07:31:18,wallstreetbets,LOL
2021-05-30 20:38:49,wallstreetbets,"fuck it, I'm in!"

2021-05-31 00:03:18,wallstreetbets,So is Germany’s market where BB trades as well
2021-05-31 03:06:00,wallstreetbets,"But market cap is a lot smaller than AMC, so doesn’t take much to move it."

2021-05-31 12:19:39,wallstreetbets,"Im big in bb, and also Uwmc.  Uwmc is looking good for a value play with squeeze potential as well.  Long term trend switched to bullish after recent earnings. Very undervalued with a P/E of 0.27"

2021-05-31 03:10:11,wallstreetbets,"I think it might. The event is similar to the last big run up on these meme stocks with ""no catalyst"" other than hype. I won't say the price is definitely going one way or another, but I do encourage you to look at upcoming events, past earnings, next earnings date, company fundamentals, and basically do your dd before trying to ride the hype train. I think they're a great company with a lot of upcoming catalysts that will justify a much higher share price, long term."
2021-05-31 02:58:42,wallstreetbets,"Did you not see the quotes? Also, how much profit did they (not) make last quarter? They're not quite there, but they're close. Generating cash flow isn't the same as being profitable. 

Edit: Also, is this really your only post on this account?"
2021-05-31 11:44:18,wallstreetbets,"When you short a stock, you are borrowing the stock and selling it. 
Imagine it's last Friday morning. You borrow 1000 shares of AMC and sell them at open for $35, you now have $35,000. Later that day you buy back 1000 shares at $24. You can then return the stock you borrowed, and keep the $11,000 difference, minus the brokers fees. 

Shorting isn't just a money printer, as Citadel discovered. If the price moves significantly up before you can pay back your loan, your losses are unlimited. To win shorting AMC, you'd have to buy back in as soon as the market corrects significantly downward. I expect it'll hit $20 or below sometime this week, which is why I'm saying I'd like to short it, even if I don't think it'll stay that low. That's similar to how GME, AMC, and PLTR moved in JAN/FEB."
2021-05-31 00:02:12,wallstreetbets,So would you buy all AMC or BB or split the $14K?
2021-05-31 00:03:22,wallstreetbets,And I’m also not a rich asshole just a married asshole

2021-05-31 09:14:43,wallstreetbets,The stock just needs to reach 100$ for him to reach the 10k
2021-05-31 09:36:20,wallstreetbets,Always hilarious when the 'numbers' guy can't do simple math
2021-05-31 08:38:20,wallstreetbets,BB will go higher than 20-30.
2021-05-31 03:03:57,wallstreetbets,They were at a great price under $8. Now? Not so much.
2021-05-31 01:15:54,wallstreetbets,"I have sold several calls on BB. It’s cheap so I can afford to buy it in lots. So ya it may not all be MM’s, may be some poor people like me just trying to make a few extra bucks."

2021-05-31 02:50:50,wallstreetbets,"Alright Genus when your hedging you are in effect “buying” so you will increase the stock price, which goes back to point. Plus Not every Mm will hedge, and when they do it’s only a fraction of the options just for protection otherwise they make no $$."
2021-05-31 09:44:37,wallstreetbets,$15 9/17 seems relatively conservative. Will print off it's ITM.
2021-05-31 01:00:44,wallstreetbets,It will gap on Tuesday to meet the Canadian price.
2021-05-30 23:59:59,wallstreetbets,It does

Some brokers automatically exercise the option at expiry of it's in the money, to which you would need the cash to buy the 100 shares. If you don't want to make sure you sell it before the end of the expiration trading day

Edit: obligatory if you don't understand options please do research and educate yourself before you buy them. Buying/selling them without understanding what you're doing can put you in really dangerous financial positions."

Had a few shares left and bought in some more when it came down a bit. Then it really went down so I was a loss on those, but overall still ahead. So I averaged down. Then I learned about options. I want to hang onto them so I bought more to get a lot and sold a covered call. Price went down more so I bought another lot, then another.

If I keep doing this I'm gonna need a better title  


##Where Is The Correction?

Seems like over the last week or two (or three), there’s been some media attention around a possible correction. It makes sense: we’ve had some volatility lately, seasonality is upon us, markets have looked somewhat extended at all time highs. And yet, it seems like we just can’t get a meaningful pullback. Two weeks in a row we touched the 50DMA on SPY, the Nasdaq found support about 8% down from its ATHs, and the Russell has been trading in an ever tighter range, but there’s been no urgency to the selling and just a week and half after hitting some recent lows we’re back just a few points off ATHs. 

Analyst calls for a pullback are still out there, but even they concede that they’ve no idea when and we could possibly see new ATHs before such an event occurs. After the recent weeks of scary inflation data (bonds aren’t buying it), a _digital asset_ crash, and recently Fed taper talk, you have to wonder what would be the catalyst to initiate such a pullback if we’re still just a few bps off ATHs after all that. 

Close to six weeks on, the picture looks different. We’ve reset some of the stretched technical indicators, the inflation data looks temporary (for now), and the market held up well through some choppiness. To summarize the thoughts of other, more knowledgeable people: perhaps we’ve had the pullback we’ve been looking for, just more controlled and constrained to the sectors and stocks that needed it. 

Alright, let’s move on and look at some charts…

##Charts

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/dIqgt1V)

Performance has been relatively flat lately, with the exception of ARKK - it’s had %12 bounce in the last week and a half, since the most recent bottom on the 19th:

[ARKK, 1y](https://imgur.com/xUqyEy2)

There’s also been an uptick in meme stock bullishness, and there seems to have been a broad bounce in risky / non-profitable growth stocks, perhaps correlated to the recent unwind in _digital asset_ markets?

Running down through the major indices:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/bLsKX9P)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/6WgjYPv)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/xv8eyhX)

- SPY trading in a narrow range since mid-April; since the last bounce we’ve been drifting upward which seems to be the direction of least resistance. Will be bullish if we break above the recent ATH at ~422 (~4238 on /ES), but could be range bound for awhile.
- QQQ in a similar situation; support at ~316, but expect to need a break above 335 (~13750 on /NQ) to warrant a bullish stance. 
- IWM still range bound, but had an encouraging week - moving through the 21 and 50DMAs, but this could just be another head-fake within this range.
- Since the recent lows on 05/19, we seem to have lost all selling conviction and are simply drifting higher. You can see MACD crossovers and rising RSI on all indices, indicative of a momentum shift. 
- However, I’d be careful about being too bullish here until we’ve had a close above the top-side of the ranges here - we may not crash but we may need some kind of catalyst to push us higher from here.
- Keep an eye on the risk-on trade: is this a momentum shift or just a bounce?

Based off the action the last few weeks and how things look now, it’s hard to have any bearish conviction in the short-term. The same could be said for the bulls, and I don’t see any catalyst to spur further upside on, though there is some argument that a Fed taper announcement would result in a bullish move; we could always just melt up as well.

###Bonus Charts

[ATVI - Possible Breakout Ahead](https://imgur.com/q56t73d)

With positive analyst sentiment (just one example), a valuation lagging in some aspect to peers (e.g. P/CF), and some consolidating/range-bound action since late February, this could be primed for a run, but only if we see a close above 98 - above 99 would be even better. I’d be wary to take much of a position here until then.

[AAPL - Possible Breakdown Ahead](https://imgur.com/LXmL4QJ)

AAPL’s been in this sideways range since late December, and perhaps worryingly it hasn’t matched the recent bounce-back in tech and instead is wobbling in a tight range between it’s 50 and 200 DMAs. It’s current valuation metrics are far above it’s 5yr averages, though that’s perhaps attributed to their expansion into services among other things. If we close below the 200DMA

Post covid = pre covid.
Everyone knows what happened the last time rates were raised in '18 and trying that now without at least giving covid recovery another year would be madness."
2021-05-31 11:03:51,wallstreetbets,"This is a very interesting perspective, although it is a bit bullish, it is taking into account actual data. Maybe we are in the correction already but it was not like we thought it would be.

The whole ""Tax the Wealthy and make them pay their ""fair share"" is a giant ruse.""

JB himself took advantage of the loopholes to skirt paying taxes. That will not change, the loopholes will survive.

The only thing is, and this is why it's a ruse, is that yes, JB will increases taxes on the wealthy to make them pay ""their fair share"". The problem is, the wealthy and corporations simply do not pay taxes. They collect taxes and forward them to the government. EVERY tax the government adds to the wealthy and corporations will be added to the cost of the products we buy. It's really that simple. They are not going to take a hit financially, they will simply increase the cost to the consumer, who, btw, is the only one who pays taxes.

So, this whole tax the rich scheme is just a ruse to get you to fall for paying more taxes. There's no argument about that. It falls on the consumer, every fucking time."

Technology:

Most people see wish as a simple buy platform. But its way more they have deep learning meaning the company has software that studies the costumers behavior and proposes to them products. This has lead to 70% of sales not being from searches but from the menu.

They use a discovery based menu which is very attractive and also focus on personalized browsing just like tik tok does deep learning at its finest.

They collect data from more than 100 million users every month to personalize the menu even more giving them a very unique advantage. Using data is the key to success here because they use data to get better and more effective ads to maximiaze returns and conversion .

Growth

They grew revenue from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $1.9 billion in 2019 at a compound annual growth rate of 31% and from $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 32% revenue is diversified and global. In 2019, 93% of our revenue was from marketplace services, 84% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 16% of which was from our native advertising tool, ProductBoost, and 7% was from logistics services.

They refer to marketplace revenue, excluding revenue from ProductBoost, as core marketplace revenue. ProductBoost is an advertising feature by which our merchants can promote their listings within user feeds.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 82% of revenue was from marketplace services, 90% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 10% of which was from ProductBoost, and 18% was from logistics services.

In terms of geographic diversification by users, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 43% of core marketplace revenue came from Europe, 42% from North America, 5% from South America, and 10% from the rest of the world growth has been highly capital efficient.

They have been able to achieve this massive growth and scale by having net cumulative cash flow from operations of $16 million from January 1, 2017 to September 30, 2020, aided by their positive cash float, where they receive an upfront payment from a user, and remit payment to a merchant a number of weeks later.

Merchants

They are basically the middle man that connects millions of costumers with merchants. They also provide them with value data to help them do more sales and expand even more. Analytics and data is a key part of their business and it should not be ignored

What's is not so great about them

They grew to fast and have some problems with logistics

There have been some serious delays and even packages missing. They will need to use money from going public to solve this matter and get better at serving costumers.

There business model is to expand advertise and get new costumers. But their problems in logistic could cause them problems with visitor retention and i want to see improvements here.

# Conclusion and My Point of View :

I'm not hoping that it will be the next amazon probably will not be,but  if the management hundle All the challenges and go profitable, this can have huge upside, and even without that, it have already a great upside potential (That's why average target analysts is about 24$).

Still not entered Indian market wich can be huge.

Wish Local And wish logistics (logistic as a service) : Great potential."

2021-05-31 14:11:34,wallstreetbets,"The last 2 decades was a story of e-commerce replacing brick & mortar retail. Wish is going to be how brick & mortar retail stays in business via Wish Local. Mom & pop retail shops house wish inventory so wish doesn’t have to pay expensive real estate costs like Amazon, the customer can pick up their order at the store, the retail store gets the benefit of a new customer walking in the door & browsing their selection as well as the ability to upload their own inventory to wish’s platform & reach a new global customer base. Sooooo many reasons to be bullish about Wish"

\- They started shopping in Darkpool last week.  
\- The company has enough cash to buy all the free shares  
\- Jacqueline Reses (former CEO of SQ, board member of Alibaba during the IPO) joined the company  
\- The world's most downloaded e-commerce application  
\- Peter Thiel just bought a stack of shares  
\- Avory and Co has recently added 6% of its total portfolio."

Do you know how it works for the sellers in Amazon FBA ?   
the process is verry simple :   
\- Buy  products from China  (Alibaba or other)  
\- Send it  Amazon Wherhouses  
\- Sell it on amazon (in general 3X the price  if you want it to be profitable) 

  
So for the consumer the equation is verry simple :  
You want it in 1 day ? go to Amazon or Walmart and pay 3X the price.  
you want it  for 3 times cheaper ? go to Wish (or AliExpress or others)"

2021-05-31 11:22:41,wallstreetbets,"The thing about WISH is that it IPOed at the same time investors began to move their money away from e-commerce. After every company that had “e-commerce” as part of their operations increased 2x in 2020 (AMZN, ETSY, SHOP, SEA, etc), investors reaped the profits and began to sell their positions at the beginning of 2021. That’s why the e-commerce market as a whole has dropped about 30% since Feb 2021. 

Although Wish fell with the rest of e-commerce, it never had the original increase that needed to be “corrected”. So, this means that Wish is currently insanely undervalued, as many others have stated here. If you’re looking for an e-commerce play, this is the best one I’ve found in terms of growth potential and value. 

In my view, if WISH demonstrates that are still growing exponentially, this stock could easily go up to $40 range, given that most e-commerce stocks trade at 10x yearly revenues (wish is on pace to make 3b in revenue this year).  

Just gotta keep holding!

Edit: This is not financial advise."
2021-05-31 09:42:32,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been long wish since IPO, cost basis of $18 after averaging in. I think of it more as a data + logistics + e-commerce company. Wish Local & their logistics business is what excites me the most & keeps me bullish. They have so much opportunity for growth it’s unreal. For some reason Wall Street bets is not interested in this one at all & that’s a huge mistake. With very conservative estimates, they should have like $700-800 million non-gaap earnings by 2025. Put a 25-30 multiple on that and you have guaranteed multi bagger over next few years. And they have plenty of cash with very little debt so no liquidity problem.

2021-05-31 15:10:30,wallstreetbets,"I want to add my personal shopping experience with $WISH here. 

I'm using it as a dollar store alternative right now so I mostly buy small accessories under 15 dollars from it. It offers better product selection and services than my local dollar store and in some cases even better than Amazon. I have Amazon prime, but even with that I found at times when I needed to return things I had to pay for shipping, where on Wish I simply get the refund.

Sure the shipping is slower, but I really don't care if I need to wait for a few days to get a phone charger or a laptop bag that's more than twice as cheap as Amazon. The product quality isn't bad actually, but you do need to read the reviews and go for things above 4 stars."

2021-05-31 08:10:26,wallstreetbets,"I am a Wish Local partner store.

Wish is popular, and they seem to be trying new ideas, but I don’t know if it’s a company I can get behind.

Even if you are careful you can end up with the wrong item, either from bad descriptions, or just being sent the wrong thing. Quality is poor on many things and often times the reviews don’t help.

App is buggy. Long shipping times. Fake items, like things that say they are silver and are actually plated. 

I have has so-so luck with ordering from Wish. Most people seem to accept the risk of getting something not as described in exchange for a really cheap price.

The problem is, I think the average consumer isn’t that savvy. They don’t read the descriptions well, they don’t verify that they are not really getting a laptop for $4.99."

2021-05-31 10:08:03,wallstreetbets,In their most recent quarter their shipping time is now lower than pre Covid times. Their logistics business is chipping away at shipping times as they use data & wish local to cut costs & last mile delivery

2021-05-31 15:12:44,wallstreetbets,"I'm using it as a dollar store alternative right now so I mostly buy small accessories under 15 dollars from it. It offers better product selection and services than my local dollar store and in some cases even better than Amazon. I have Amazon prime, but even with that I found at times when I needed to return things I had to pay for shipping, where on Wish I simply get the refund.  
  
Sure the shipping is slower, but I really don't care if I need to wait for a few days to get a phone charger or a laptop bag that's more than twice as cheap as Amazon. The product quality isn't bad actually, but you do need to read the reviews and go for things above 4 stars."
2021-05-31 14:17:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes. It used to be completely bad. There are better and better goods on it these days. None of my last 15 orders required a refund. There is probably a simple reason for this. Alibaba can no longer do so to seek exclusivity from stores. Plus they started to filter the fake things pretty hard. I’m not saying there aren’t any on Wish, but they give serious penalties to fake shops and take them off immediately if you report."
2021-05-31 14:14:13,wallstreetbets,"Yes  I did few times, and I got what I was looking for,  now I dont because I dont spend time on  any shoping app,  I just log in  to buy what  I need when I need it from whoever ofering it at the moment"

2021-05-31 06:26:13,wallstreetbets,"All the Amazon branded generic products (accessories/cables/tools) are made in China just like the same products sold on Wish, except they are half the price on WISH.  Amazon makes millions off their cheap generic shit, WISH can easily acquire those customers, they just need to acquire more distribution locations, and with billions on hand I don’t think that will be problem."
2021-05-31 05:41:11,wallstreetbets,"At first, I also thought he was selling bad things. But lately, the quality has improved amazingly. My last 15 orders were all fine. Plus, if something wasn’t right, the money was refunded immediately. The most compelling argument in favor of Wish is that Jackie Reses, former CEO of Square (SQ), has joined management. And Reses was also on Alibaba’s board of directors during the IPO. She's sure to put the company in order in half a year."

Half of it is shipped slower than a carrier pigeon, the other half is hoping you get what you ordered. I.e. ordering succulent seeds and received literal grass or weed seeds. I was all for the numbers at face value until I saw it was WISH. If I refuse to buy from them, why would I buy the stock?"
2021-05-31 11:45:23,wallstreetbets,Great opportunity to short or go long?
2021-05-31 11:51:07,wallstreetbets,"I’m not comparing AMZN, I’m comparing SHOP and ETSY and the type. 

Whereas both Shopify and Etsy have about the same amount of yearly revenue than Wish (about 2.5-3b in 2020), Etsy is worth 20b, Shopify is worth 150b, and Wish only 5b. 

If Wish continues to grow exponentially (which it stopped doing in 2020 because of logistic issues and the Trump/China conflict), it can eaaasily increase its market cap 5-10x."

2021-05-31 05:20:28,wallstreetbets,"Ordered from there for the first time a few weeks ago.  First time customer discount of 80% off.  I got 10 pack of real Dove brand of deodorant for $16.  This would have cost me $60 plus at Target.  They are the real deal, not everyone believes it yet though.  They definitely know how to acquire new customers !"
2021-05-31 14:08:04,wallstreetbets,">On one hand, yea it's probably undervalued. On the other hand, getting the reputation as Chinesium: The Company could have people shifting towards Amazon/Walmart even though that's what those two seem to be turning into as of late. The space is ripe for an Amazon-like ecommerce that sells purely non-crap.

I'm fully retarded."
2021-05-31 12:54:34,wallstreetbets,Can't find it even like this :/
2021-05-31 06:44:01,wallstreetbets,"Ymmv but that was the avg in 2020

You fail to mention the decrease in product boost revenue which is a signal for merchant relationships and health of the supply side. As most marketplaces, margins are low and advertising is 90%+ plus of revenue, see PDD and BABA. Which most likely means merchants, same ones on Ali Express, just use wish as another distro channel. Ali express on the other hand charges 5% commission from each sale vs 10% on avg from wish. Everything. Also if a consumer was purely that price sensitive, they would just shop on AliExpress where the prices are significantly cheaper, that’s where I go to get all my mic bike parts. 

Fwiw, don’t have a position on wish just sharing some considerations"

2021-05-31 12:26:32,wallstreetbets,Why are you comparing wish to shop?  Why not compare Wish to JC Penny of 2018 before it went bankrupt?  JC Penny sold stuff online too back in 2018.  So should JCP have been worth 10x online revenue?

2021-05-31 01:18:31,wallstreetbets,"There’s room in that massive market for more than one player. I mean we are literally talking about the biggest consumer market there is: everything. 

If you use Amazon, you’ll notice how their prices aren’t as favorable anymore as they used to be. They up charge on a lot of in demand stuff because they can get away with it now. I think wish is healthy competition and if they can figure out logistics like shipping they will definitely be a force to be reckoned with."
2021-05-31 07:10:00,wallstreetbets,"No man, You will never find it on amazon with the same price, it'as always about 3X the price , because the seller have to take the cost of sending the product to Amazon wwherhouses and the FBA  commission,  


So the equation is verry simple : You want it in 1 day ? go to Amazon or walmart and pay 3X the price  
you want it  for 3 times cheaper ? go to Wish (or aliExpress ....)"
2021-05-31 06:58:26,wallstreetbets,"Man this is not true,  ProductBoost increased 14% YoY,   you are doing a comparaison with Q4 and this is not irrelevant, because as you know Q4 is the  the biggest qarter for E-commerce  


Will the power is not for people who are asking for something, the power is in the experiance, Wish plateforme trying to make the experience more user freindly with some deep learning algorithms so the user spend more time and money,  in ali express you buy what you are looking for. in wish you buy stuff you did never want to buy  :D"
2021-05-30 20:15:02,wallstreetbets,Bruh you can buy your wife some banging ass lingerie and dildos on there....yall been shopping in the wrong department
2021-05-31 06:36:49,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, but if you go to the site, there is a section on Branded items, everything Brand that I have ordered like Dove deodorant, Dawn dish soap, has been cheaper than retail and Amazon prices.  I think the problem is people don’t realise they sell normal brands like on Amazon just cheaper."
2021-05-31 17:35:04,wallstreetbets,"to be fair, Amazon seems to be trending in the opposite direction. More Chinese crap, less premium brands. Despite realizing this, I still buy whatever Amazon recommends the majority of the time because it's easy and fast. I imagine a lot of other people do the same"
2021-05-31 03:55:05,wallstreetbets,"Before talking about 1000$, I will kindly ask you again, go to my profile, see my last Yolo post. you will find how much"
2021-05-31 11:33:23,wallstreetbets,"I see your point, yeah  I have the same point of view for spacs, but  for this,  it's really cheap , that's why !!!!!   got punished in the same time as Spacs  (but it did not had the time to go over evaluated  as they did )  :,)"
2021-05-31 01:22:25,wallstreetbets,"I just don’t buy that most people buy shit they need from wish.

I think if it more like what Zoomers resell on their shitty little Etsy stores."
2021-05-31 11:23:47,wallstreetbets,"Not just Amazon’s own products but individual sellers listed on Amazon also. Every business-minded person raises prices when applicable (demand high, supply low, need to pay wife’s boyfriends rent etc.)"
2021-05-31 07:25:12,wallstreetbets,"Where are you getting your info?

Annual product boost revenue per their 10k filing:
2018: 214m
2019: 291m
2020: 200m

Any every commerce platform does personalization and recommendation after a browsing/ purchase. Tablestakes at this point. Wish spams email marketing, notifications as does everyone else. 

Also from a quick glance in the Q, MAUs decreased yoy by 7% and active buyers decreasing 3% and more concerning after an increase in marketing spend from 295m to 470m"
2021-05-30 20:16:58,wallstreetbets,So that's where she's been buying them. They aren't very flexible... they hurt more than they should tbh
2021-05-31 07:15:27,wallstreetbets,"could be but it takes a huge effort to discard that smell of trash they have on them, so i dont see it going really far in the 2 year timespan, but wtf do i know."
2021-05-31 04:11:33,wallstreetbets,You are bagholding down over 60K.
2021-05-31 11:53:31,wallstreetbets,"Have you looked at the risk section in the 10-k? It seems like they are a small company with incredibly tight margins trying to out compete the commerce giants. Even if wish can gather the large amounts of cash it says needs for marketing and sales expenses, that will leave them in no place to compete with predatory pricing by the titans of the industry. It doesnt seem like they have any confidence in their ability to decrease expenses as they grow….and they say they have started to see a plateau in revenue growth. 

The first 49 pages are dedicated to laying out all the risks of wish. That scares the shit out of me for sure."
2021-05-31 02:06:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I agree,  at one time Amazon was a book store. I hold no position in wish but if it goes under $7 I will for sure lol!"
2021-05-31 10:06:02,wallstreetbets,Something like 40-50% of buyers are millennials... that’s a pretty good demo to dominate
2021-05-31 08:20:03,wallstreetbets,"I'm getting my information from the Q1 report on their website,  ProductBosst Q1 2020 was 44M   Q1 2021 50M  


Will this is the hard equation, if you want everythink perfect , go buy Amazon with 1.8T evaluation (maybe sure but not much upside potential)   


This one is Cheap for what it is, as it is, if it goes better, this can be huge (for 5B company).  


When you are young and want to be millionaire , you have to take same risky  bets (for me going AMC or GME is like gumble ) This one is more on  a value of the company  the company is worth more than it is evaluated for what it is"
2021-05-31 05:30:10,wallstreetbets,Wrong 🕳
2021-05-31 07:23:25,wallstreetbets,"I think they are smart to spend money on customer acquisition, like I said in a previous post they offered me a 80% off first time customer coupon after I downloaded the app.  So that really reeled me in to look around and I saw many household goods that I was going to purchase anyway at a retail, so I got it from them to see if the prices were real and indeed they were.  Hopefully this continues as a trend and customers realize they are a real deal."
2021-05-31 10:21:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it’s not surprising. I meant millennials younger than me and Zoomers.

No one my age really goes out of their way to buy cheap Chinese shit when it’s already so convenient and available."
2021-05-31 10:50:27,wallstreetbets,"The numbers say otherwise my friend. You’d need to demonstrate that it’s mostly Etsy resells. And even if that’s true, what does it say that buyers keep coming back to wish to buy products... to then go on and resell on Etsy & other apps? That’s indicative of real demand. And I’m sure the average age of this buying on Etsy like platforms is younger than the average age of the population"

2021-05-31 05:45:19,wallstreetbets,"Hey bro 

Thanks for posting,  I enjoyed the short story. 

Please consider googling ""anterior pelvic tilt"". The direction your toes point whilst walking forward leads me to believe there are some adjustments you could make that would increase your quality of life. 

Next time you brush your teeth try to think about pointing your second(index) toe straight forward. If my hunch about anterior pelvic tilt is true then there are also various exercises you can perform. These exercises/stretches mostly focus on strengthening/engaging the lower abdomen/glutes/hammies and lengthening/releasing the psoas/hips. 

Sorry for anything wonky about my post. My sleeping medication is still alive, well and signing autographs."

When you lose 50% market value, you need to make 100% to get you back to breakeven. A stock falling 50% has less probability going up 100% than say a hot stock gaining new interest/price momentum. 

Most of the time, selling at a 10% loss and rethinking/replanning your trade can save you the rest of your portfolio."

2021-05-31 06:32:59,wallstreetbets,"GME is literally a perfect example of people being risk taking idiots though.  It was a brilliant and assured play when it first broke... but only as a short term smash and grab hit.  As soon as all the idiots turned it into a crusade and tried holding positions beyond the initial turmoil, t
It became something else (well, unpredictable).

There is a reason they say the markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent.  It's very likely that those funds short on GME can afford to just keep servicing the debt ledger indefinitely at stupid low interest rates, and never actually realize their perceived losses.  

When you're talking about that many billions... the rules of the system can always be influenced/changed/gamed.  That's the nature of money in the modern world.  Even something like a hostile take over of GME's board and gutting their operations at the source should be considered as being theoretically possible and worth the trouble."

Nevertheless, please report immediately to your supervisor office, please leave any recording devices  outside, we also would like to remind that any disclosure of internal talks or publicing penalties, are in breach of your contract which would result in severe consequences.

Finance your calls by selling earnings month put spreads with the higher strike at the PT above and the lower strike at the current price.

Druckenmiller left the Quantum Fund in 2000 to focus on his own fund, Duquesne Capital, which became a family office in 2010. He is a concentrated, high conviction investor, and his AUM of $3.88B contains 60 holdings as of Q1 of 2021. His top position, Microsoft, represents 12.93% of his portfolio

Druckenmiller’s large buys that stand out are Citigroup and Palantir. These are new positions that Druckenmiller added in Q1, so it seems like he is forecasting a future big move as both positions are in his Top 10 holdings. See below for Druckenmiller’s largest buys:

Druckenmiller’s Palantir purchase is in contrast with his old partner, Soros, as Soros liquidated his entire Palantir position (18.46 million shares) in Q1

2021-05-30 21:52:45,wallstreetbets,"idiotic comment

Edit: Interesting that I’m being downvoted. If the general ape population on this website didn’t even a hint of research, they would see druckenmiller was the *analyst* behind the worlds most profitable trades (he was George Soros analyst before George Soros broke the Bank of England and was the guy who pitched the idea to Soros in the first place). he wasn’t taking someone else’s ideas or inside information, he was the man generating the ideas. The vast majority of his wealth came from forex and to a slightly lesser degree commodities, and to suggest he is running a Ponzi scheme after RETURNING ALL OUTSIDE INVESTOR MONEY + RETURNS AS STATED and THEN switching to a ‘family office’ is one of the dumbest theories I’ve heard yet."
2021-05-31 05:59:53,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much this. Even if its all ""legit"" plays, odds are Druckenmiller had 5-10 really good years, got to meet the right people, and has been coasting off insider information and backroom collaborations ever since. As we've seen with the GME debacle, the market is complete corrupt and the insiders are colluding with each other overseen by toothless regulators who are in on it as well. Once you're in the inner circle its impossible not to print cash. Politicians who can't even figure out not to look at porn on their phones are killing it on the market, I guess they're just geniuses too huh?"

That’s what we looking for"
2021-05-30 20:49:33,wallstreetbets,MF 30 years. fuck that 300% a year or nothing I don't want to be 60 and rich and I want to be younger and rich.
2021-05-31 10:51:34,wallstreetbets,Except the stock market doesn't have compound interest. The stock market simply compounds continuously. When a stock goes up by 1% you now have 1% more instantly. If it goes up 1% again you are already making money off the money you just made. It is more than if the stock just went up 2% at once.

And that was when you had over $2.5 in RKT still."
2021-05-31 08:37:51,wallstreetbets,"They don't have any leading edge nodes aka all the chips they can make gonna be slower and less efficient than the expensive ones that TSMC can make for apple, amd, nvidia ect. TSMC has no compitition at the fastest node. Samsung kinda close but not really.

Since UMC only has old nodes that a bunch of companies also have, they have to compete on price. So they make only small money per each chip. TSMC has both leading edge and older nodes so they can make money both ways."
2021-05-31 06:39:37,wallstreetbets,Yea same but was getting murdered everywhere else ahah
2021-05-30 21:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Ain’t no chicken tendies, neither!"

2021-05-31 09:58:56,wallstreetbets,So then why pick UMC over TSMC?
2021-05-31 17:33:59,wallstreetbets,So UMC isn't a good investment?
2021-05-31 11:23:05,wallstreetbets,"The slow, cheap, chips are what auto manufacturers and small appliance makers want
When demand exceeds supply, UMC can charge whatever they want for their chips. I'm expecting that a large swing in price of chips will affect the cheapest stocks at a higher percentage than the more expensive ones. 
I'm up on my stocks and options already, so if you think there's a reason I should dump and move to TSM or MCHP, I'd be happy to hear it."
2021-05-31 15:58:06,wallstreetbets,"Typically when a company with lower margins experiences a situation were they can push prices higher, their EPS grows more than the company with larger margins so I agree with this logic.

Example: Chip prices from 1.00$ to 1.05$.

 Company A makes 10 cents per chip before the price change. They now make 15 cents. Their earnings rode by 50 percent.

Company B, the worse company only made 1 cent per chip before the price change. Earnings go from 1 cent to 6 cents per chip, 600 percent increase.

Longer term company B is gonna go to the shitter but short term the market gonna price this bitch up. Now the question becomes how sure are you that this isn't already priced or how much of it isn't priced in. Definitely think it's an interesting play"
2021-05-31 16:21:22,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure about how much of the current boom is priced in, but I expect there's at least a small panic coming regarding chip availability, and with how long it takes to create new manufacturing facilities, we're not even close to the top. My calls are for January, and between a constantly worsening shortage, new EV manufacturing, and upcoming inflation, I will be absolutely astounded if UMC isn't worth more than $20/share at some point by then, and would only be slightly surprised if it got to $30. 

What do you think? Is the current investor response to microchip shortage at the top of it's ferver, or do you expect panic/fomo buying in the next few months?"
2021-05-31 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Opinions on why ""The Big Short"" investor Michael Burry was visited by the SEC and subsequently forced to take down his twitter I'm a little confused about why the big short investor Michael Burry was visited by the SEC. When going over his archive of tweets he rails against tesla, robinhood and warns of a bubble in the market; what I don't understand is why he would be visited by the SEC for expressing his opinion on twitter. 

Isn't this literally what the pundits on CNBC do all day? All I ever hear on that channel is ""Buy, Buy, Buy,"" whereas Burry's tweets have substance behind them. For example, he warned about inflation in February and as of April 2021 it has begun to hit the markets. Also, when does someone become to big to express their opinion about the market?"
2021-05-30 20:27:50,wallstreetbets,He had to take it down so he wouldn’t spoil the sequel to the big short movie. Duhhhhh silly! “The everything short” coming to the next theater company that buys out all the other ones that file chapter 11 including amc lol and/or the highest bidder of a streaming service

Right now, pundits are claiming this risk free rate represents people’s confidence in the equities market or some bullshit like that. But in reality, bonds are way fucking oversold.

2021-05-30 21:22:30,wallstreetbets,If the SEC tried to somehow force him to close his Twitter account he would have fought it in court.

2021-05-30 21:49:52,wallstreetbets,I think he decided for himself to stop tweeting. I'm sure SEC paid papa Elon a visit as well. The only difference is that Elon told the SEC to go fuck themselves...
2021-05-30 20:47:56,wallstreetbets,"Where money is involved, government control and corruption is involved. The SEC can do whatever they want, and wrong whoever they want. They don’t like Michael Burry’s thoughts on the market, and because he has a large follower base, they chose to shut him down. Michael Burry can’t fight them, Twitter can’t fight them, the Supreme Court can’t fight them. They hold all the power and there is absolutely nothing that can be done about it."

2021-05-31 11:19:13,wallstreetbets,I could be ignorant but I thought he took his twitter down a few months ago because he was making a lot of alt-right tweets and people wouldn't stop shitting on him. Or did he come back since then and had to take his twitter down again?
2021-05-30 21:31:48,wallstreetbets,Because he manipualted the market. With out argument. At least when Elon tweets it's worded in a way that it's speculation

Elon Musk makes market swinging comments weekly, but the SEC cannot or has not silenced him.

It is only fair other heavyweights be allowed the same liberal free speech, which in Canada is a law. 

Secondly, the initiator is right.  News channels, fund managers, economists all offer their opinion and perception of the market all day long, every day.

Maybe the problem is comments on a social platform need a disclaimer at the bottom, ""my personal opinion,arlet performance blah blah blah""!"

The comparison with VW is laughable. Tesla is years ahead, and will be by the time competition comes closer to todays state of technology. I can recommend the term 10x dna, that’s the reason why VW Ford etc will not catch up to Tesla.

The current valuation is overpriced in the short-term. So shorting it is a valid strategy. Long-term it will be a loosing bet - again for many „Burrys“ out there as seen in the past."

The books and advice always come from the survivors, Like wars are written by the winners: they never suggest they got there by a chaotic fluke, they always have a self justifying system for ""being the greatest"" .

He doesn't know when it's going to occur, just that it will. A cover up seems logical since it's sort of a national security threat- it discredits the US at a time that china wants to challenge as an emerging alternative. Who knows how far they'd go to cover it up if that's what the stakes are.

I'll prob gamble as much as I'm ok losing on it. Spread between TBT and SPXS. Maybe a few bucks in UVXY for shits and gigs.

Maybe wait until the next time his company releases their holdings to the SEC and see if he's still shorting the 20yr treasury bonds."

2021-05-30 21:38:46,wallstreetbets,dont even start this on WSB.... lol...the system is quite complicated ....repos and reverse repos are tip of the iceberg...it actually quite impressive that it still works..
2021-05-31 08:41:56,wallstreetbets,"I think you're a bit confused. You enter into a repo if you want cash. The other person is entering into a reverse repo (not a repo reversal). It's called repo which is short for repurchase agreement - that's because securities are being sold with an agreement to buy it back later. That means you'll have cash in the meantime. The underlying securities are more commonly govies such as T-bills, meaning should the ""borrower"" default, you get to keep the cash-equivalent (Because counterparty is US govt) securities. So economically this is just collateralized lending (reverse repo) / borrowing (repo). Unless that made sense, it would be great if you could explain repo reversal to me."

2021-05-31 12:31:29,wallstreetbets,"The US can keep running the printers until the worlds faith in the dollar runs out or demand outpaces supply: Both of these lead to inflation. 

The first scenario, the loss of faith in the dollar, would mean huge currency depreciations. Think 50 USD to 1 Peso. 

The second would be traditional, CPI hyperinflation. Think the price of bread doubling in a month. 

Either way their is inflation, but we cannot be sure either will happen. The world seems to be ok with pricing everything in dollars, buying bonds, and hoarding dollars to create forex reserves so their central banks can defend their currency when the time comes. 

Maybe other countries will become prominent enough that their currency will be held to the same regard as the dollar. The Euro is a good contestant for the coveted reserve currency status. 

Bonds aren’t being sold off much anywhere, so it looks like big money is satisfied with the ten year bond’s interest rate settling at 1.6%.

2021-05-31 00:38:35,wallstreetbets,"K so tldr for morons

Pre 2008 we were in an economic regime where capital flowed because companies wanted to spend. When crashes happened we would make money cheaper (lower the interest rate) and companies would borrow because it made sense.

In 2008 we couldn't lower the rate. We had to inject money some other way. We opted to buy company's treasury bonds and give them cash. This is different because it forced them to spend. They were incentivized for different reasons.

This is key. One thing is true throughout history: once you start printing it's hard to stop. You need cash -> you print -> people lose faith in the economy -> cash is more scarce -> you print.

Central Banks will buy anything. Historically they've bought everything from corporate bonds to stocks just to keep markets up. The US Fed announced they are going to buy unlimited amounts of Treasury bonds to keep the economy healthy (yield curve pinning). They also are buying corporate bonds https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/06/29/the-fed-is-buying-some-of-the-biggest-companies-bonds-raising-questions-over-why.html

US is in a relatively good spot. 1) we aren't pegged to gold 2) we aren't overly beholden to foreign denominated debt. Example: Germany owed France reparations in Francs. Germany cannot print Francs. So Germany had hyper inflation. US has fewer structural issues but also different structural issues.

TLDR

Read the fucking book"
2021-05-31 02:43:44,wallstreetbets,"lol ‘in before the crowd.’ Look at the repo market and you’ll see that essentially shorting US treasuries is one of the most crowded trades there possibly could be

2021-05-30 21:19:58,wallstreetbets,Having to prop up the rates with around a trillion dollars in treasury buy backs just to keep short term interest rates from going negative just after announcing that “inflation is transitionary” they are having to prop up it up.

2021-05-30 20:59:43,wallstreetbets,"3 months ago the official fed statement was that there was no inflation and thus no need to raise rates. Now it's that there is inflation, comfortably above fed targets, but it's ""transitory"" so no need to raise rates. If 3 months from now that transitory inflation is showing signs of picking up steam instead of slowing down the fed will have no choice but to start talking about raising rates far sooner than their 2023 current target. The markets will dip the second Powell even hints at raising rates before then. Things are too unsettled and too unprecedented right now for anyone to be comfortable relying on rate hikes to be several years out."

2021-05-31 05:40:23,wallstreetbets,"No because interest rates are still way below their historical average (3 - 5%). Interest rates and by proxy inflation have to normalise at some point.

2021-05-30 22:09:50,wallstreetbets,"That‘s just simply not true and biased by the media. The FED said it loud and clear for months, that there will be inflation, and it will be higher in the beginning. And that they have the tools to tackle this. Multiple FED officials are telling you that this is exactly what they predicted and why they are not concerned.

Don‘t just believe the narrative from the media. See the official meetings, videos and interviews from the FED members, especially from JPOW on YouTube. The situation currently is exactly like they‘ve planned, and they are prepared for this. They will not raise rates before their own timeline, and will not dictate themselves by the media."
2021-05-30 20:16:47,wallstreetbets,"So bond purchases are good for long term rates, but they hurt yields due to inflation so they kick treasuries to banks to keep the short term  interest rates higher so they do not go negative. Got it.

2021-05-31 16:13:35,wallstreetbets,No gains until sale
2021-05-31 12:24:49,wallstreetbets,The stock was trading very low at the time I bought them
2021-05-31 19:13:30,wallstreetbets,"Getting lucky once doesn’t mean you’re suddenly some market wiz. Besides, options with longer exp dates are less volition due to time decay"
2021-05-31 13:38:37,wallstreetbets,"I have 2 $30 calls, that I am thinking of selling one at 29.95 so I can exercise the other to buy 100 more shares? I just don't know what will be worth more, like if amc went to the moon? Can they go higher?"
2021-05-30 20:07:55,wallstreetbets,I maxed out a heloc on AMC . This is absolutely a YOLO for me. I also hold shares
2021-05-31 13:44:49,wallstreetbets,"To clarify,  it is an option because the buyer may sell, exercise, or do nothing and let it expire worthless. Puts or calls. 

The only option a seller has is to buy it back before expiring otherwise they may be obligated to give up stock or buy stock if exercised at expiry. Or nothing happens and they simply net the premium they were paid."
2021-05-31 17:26:04,wallstreetbets,You pretty much answered your own question by saying you have a rh account.  Gme has exponentially more upside than amc
2021-05-31 15:38:28,wallstreetbets,When did you get into those options??
2021-05-30 22:01:32,wallstreetbets,"roll into gamestop dude, u wont regret it"
2021-05-31 11:52:40,wallstreetbets,Won’t those calls be way in the money anyway?
2021-05-31 03:58:07,wallstreetbets,That's what I did too.  I was betting they'd figure something out.
2021-05-31 00:29:41,wallstreetbets,Great great not born yet
2021-05-31 14:50:46,wallstreetbets,When did you buy?
2021-05-31 16:07:22,wallstreetbets,Good luck.
2021-05-31 17:26:58,wallstreetbets,That’s literally how nothing works.  How has amc changed its business model so it won’t end up where it was pre covid?  What happens when the post covid boom ends?
2021-05-30 23:14:53,wallstreetbets,Am I reading it wrong? Looks like he paid $2.22 for a $3 1/22 call? What was the share price when he bought it?
2021-05-31 12:26:09,wallstreetbets,Ah okay thank you! Still getting experience with options so I appreciate the feedback
2021-05-31 11:09:23,wallstreetbets,My man!  I just applied for one. Selling the house anyway but it's taking forever so I figured I use my equity for something useful in the mean time.
2021-05-31 13:46:41,wallstreetbets,"Man, my biggest road block with all this is not being able to speak the language. The trade vernacular is really part of a culture. Thanks for your response."
2021-05-31 17:29:18,wallstreetbets,"Can you help me and tell me why, please?"

2021-05-31 13:55:48,wallstreetbets,">AMC will never go bankrupt, Americans love the movies too much to let that happen. COVID is temporary. Our passion for films is forever.
  
This could be the opening crawl for the movie that eventually will be made about all this. Perfect. AMC2THEMOON!!!"
2021-05-31 11:55:57,wallstreetbets,"Dude, the theatre is church to me. Covid has nearly fucking broken me by closing the theatres.

We had a window here of about two weeks where theatres were open and I tried to catch Godzilla vs Kong and I didn't get there in time. They sold out opening day and we locked down again the next morning. It took everything I had to not sit down and cry right there in the lobby.

Also, I'm a Canadian, but your point stands."
2021-05-31 13:28:52,wallstreetbets,Simple but profound
2021-05-31 08:41:42,wallstreetbets,Replace AMC with Blockbuster.
2021-05-31 00:19:28,wallstreetbets,"Why do you assume only AMC can keep the tradition going? 

Do you think they are the only ones that know how to mark up candy and project film?"
2021-05-31 12:47:59,wallstreetbets,"I hate the movies, and so does a lot of other Americans, and the quality of cinemas are going down the shitter. Movies just plain suck these days, haven't been to movies since ghost in the shell.

AMC going to have to reinnovate their market to keep it alive.

No one is going to pay for overpriced food and drink and no way to take a pause from the movie for a bathroom break.

I hear they are coming out with a streaming service, which is a toestep in the right direction, since everyone, even Amazon, has streaming services.

I don't see the theatre surviving gin the current state it is in, besides as you say the culture and literally just kids getting together with nothing else to do."
2021-05-31 17:31:05,wallstreetbets,People have gained appreciation for businesses they want to keep. The movies are one of them. Streaming will not sustain this industry and we have figured that out. We want to keep movies so we will support this company through buying stock and patronizing its venues.
2021-05-31 02:20:27,wallstreetbets,"Not the person you are replying to, but it looks like you are correct. I think I would agree with your original point of the risk vs reward for this call if he didn't already have shares. But since he did, might as well make an extra yolo play for a bit more leveraged gains and some juicy karma, ehh?! (Unless you were suggesting he go a bit further OTM, in which case would also be good.)"
2021-05-31 02:43:10,wallstreetbets,"He bought 3 lottery tickets.   
When the AMC numbers are greater than his ticket numbers, he makes money. If the AMC numbers go under his ticket numbers, he loses everything.   


The strike price is his ticket number. If it was a put he'd want AMC numbers to be below his ticket numbers."
2021-05-31 18:22:46,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood is not a good app. And it does not create or encourage good investing.  It’s options are a classic example, you lack basic functionally.  You can trade options on rh but if you’re going to get into options get a real brokerage, one that won’t fuck you on the bid-ask or order flow."

2021-05-31 16:05:06,wallstreetbets,Can I buy an option contract through Webull 🤔
2021-05-31 00:32:22,wallstreetbets,"AMC is in the Best position to, most brick and mortar- they have $$$
You want to start a theater and go up against AMC? Good luck, they have made massive investments in their facilities over the last few years. They are ready to serve the next generation of movie goers right now."
2021-05-31 18:25:12,wallstreetbets,"The idea that there has been some cultural or societal awakening that is going to have people flocking forever to movie theatres for no other reason than going to a movie theatre is a poor investment strategy.  Digital is on the rise, studios keeping a bigger chunk of ticket sales is on the rise.  Movies have a shorter theatre cycle before going to digital is on the rise.  How is amc going to respond?  I’ve been asking for a year and no one has told me."
2021-05-31 05:00:32,wallstreetbets,Thanks.
2021-05-31 18:24:38,wallstreetbets,"So, I have to involve a broker or can it be done with an app? Webull? Stockpile?"
2021-05-31 09:40:51,wallstreetbets,Is
2021-05-31 17:25:03,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you gotta apply for it"
2021-05-31 10:13:37,wallstreetbets,"You’re spot on dude. What the heck is even Loews Cineplex? 10/10 I’m watching a movie at AMC. Comfy seats, ability to recline, nice facilities. It’s the spot. I’m happy for you dude!"
2021-05-31 08:34:47,wallstreetbets,Literally watched AMC buy out every movie theater within 50-100 miles around me. The biggest one was a drive but those recliner seats are a game changer. Literally the best position it could be in rn. Has a chick fil a in the same parking lot and now that I'm older I can order from the movie theater bar lol.
2021-05-31 00:55:17,wallstreetbets,"If you think the future of movie theaters is 300 people cramming into a room together paying $20 a head to see the latest Hollywood cash grab then okay.

I just don’t share your rose tinted nostalgia."
2021-05-31 15:20:41,wallstreetbets,"Galaxy, Cinemark, and a plethora of smaller local chains. 
IMO AMC has some of the worst maintained theaters I’ve ever had the displeasure of sitting in."
2021-05-31 15:05:18,wallstreetbets,I think you're wrong! I think movie theaters are going to fade away.. They are the next blockbuster... Streaming is the way of the future. Big facts.. NOBODY wants to pay $10 for popcorn and another $8 for a soda plus $30 per person..  Its just not worth it!
2021-05-31 18:43:29,wallstreetbets,"There was nothing wrong with their previous model. They spent profits upgrading their facilities. Go
Ahead and hang out at home, we will be out at the movies!🍿🦍"
2021-05-31 18:49:58,wallstreetbets,"Yes, many services\\apps have the ability to trade options that arent neutered like RH.  You can look around,"

2021-05-31 12:00:32,wallstreetbets,"Dude, some things need to be seen in a theatre. They just do. 

I'm not saying that streaming is not going to take a bite, but movie theatres are not going away."
2021-05-31 14:07:19,wallstreetbets,"Lol just because you don't agree doesn't mean others feel the same way. Your probably 1 in 50 Americans who don't fondly remember going to the movies. Sorry lol but AMC will always be the leader in movie going. Probably the last one, I'd bet."
2021-05-31 08:27:52,wallstreetbets,Around here it's closer to 150 people per room paying about $20-25 not counting the additional $20 in food. Also theaters have been packed since the reopening here.
2021-05-31 15:44:26,wallstreetbets,"About 1/4 to 1/3 of our population never gave a shit about restrictions or acting responsibly.  And I think those that did act responsibly last year will soon give in and give up -- out of fatigue or just our collective inability to pay attention to *anything* long-term.  

200 per theater pretty soon, and 300 not far behind. Business as usual. That's a ""rose-tinted"" view for AMC stock, but quite a shit-tinted statement about our society."
2021-05-31 01:16:50,wallstreetbets,"Not the future, it is happening now and will continue to increase overtime along with population growth. Going to the movies will always be a thing."
2021-05-31 12:50:30,wallstreetbets,That's what I'm saying it's the worst movie experience and you pay premium for it.
2021-05-31 15:40:34,wallstreetbets,Which theaters have you attended recently that need upgrading sir? I will let Adam Aron know- he will get them fixed.
2021-05-31 15:12:50,wallstreetbets,I take my family to the movies all the time and gladly spend $100 for the experience. If you like movies you need an industry to support it. Streaming won’t do.
2021-05-31 18:48:20,wallstreetbets,"Typical bagholder.  Can't talk actual facts so now you presume what, im anti-movies?  A shut in, that im not going to see movies?  That's your defense of your position?"

2021-05-31 15:52:54,wallstreetbets,CUS!!!
2021-05-31 12:05:05,wallstreetbets,But do they need to be seen in an AMC one?
2021-05-31 16:21:31,wallstreetbets,"Accusing me of bias confirmation while perpetuating your own. Classic.

I remember going to the movies fondly as a kid and teenager. 

I also remember how shitty some parts of it were looking back.

It’s not good enough for me to want to relive it. Maybe if they improve the experience I will."
2021-05-31 02:28:13,wallstreetbets,"My dad said when I was a little ape, “Going to Blockbuster son will always be a thing....”

*Netflix original series hits hard*"
2021-05-31 01:42:00,wallstreetbets,I think it might look differently. But if we all thought the same things there’d be no money to be made at the expense of each other.
2021-05-31 15:54:48,wallstreetbets,The movies are a nice once in a while thing.. If amc hopes to stay alive then they need to massively reduce their stores... Think back when blockbuster had all them stores.. And no cash they lost the battle to Netflix.. Which is what they're about to do to everyone going to streaming. I guarantee they short squeeze but dont be surprised when amc bankrupts by 2024
2021-05-31 18:53:49,wallstreetbets,If you think America’s movie industry will thrive without movie going as a major cultural driver -you’re wrong. If you support streaming as the new trend- you are looking in a direction that would annihilate the industry financially and seriously reduce the budgets and quality of the films. Clearly you don’t like the movies as much as me otherwise you would support their existence and continued prosperity- as they have had thus far in our history.
2021-05-31 14:32:22,wallstreetbets,probably
2021-05-31 12:13:05,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily, but why reinvent the wheel?

There's exactly one theatre chain in my town. Wanna guess who owns it?"
2021-05-31 14:42:59,wallstreetbets,Yes. All movies must be watched on AMC screens. It’s the only way.
2021-05-31 17:11:47,wallstreetbets,"Okay I'll reword my statement:

You're probably in a minority of people who loathe going to the movies.

Like you're sitting experiencing a film that may be the topic of conversations for years to come, and hopefully your enjoying it.

I think alot of people who choose to go the movies accept the parts you describe as shitty."
2021-05-31 11:47:24,wallstreetbets,"There is no comparison between the two. Going to the movies is an experience. Going to blockbuster was a way to get movies at home.

There is really no equivalent to the theatre. I have a 100-inch projection screen with a very nice projector. A 9-piece reclining sectional (most pieces) and a decent sound system. It’s not the same.

Movies will be around for awhile. But I think their model may change a bit"
2021-05-31 12:44:20,wallstreetbets,"Not the same at ALL dude. 
Streaming websites and movies have replaced Blockbuster.
There is NOTHING that can replace the experience of watching a “blockbuster” movie on the big screen. 
Plus with all the new movies being released digitally, there are almost immediate flawless copies available to pirate online. Movie production companies will soon see their diluted revenues and opt for theatrical releases only."
2021-05-31 02:33:13,wallstreetbets,Your dad really messed you up man...
2021-05-31 16:12:32,wallstreetbets,"Increase locations, double down- acquire competitors assets."
2021-05-31 11:49:51,wallstreetbets,"He hit you with real data and then you waved your hand and pointed to a trend that he had already factored.  Not saying that makes him right but you certainly made the inferior case.  That’s not a question of taste, just reread the conversation."
2021-05-31 12:52:51,wallstreetbets,"Ah yeas, such an experience sitting with strangers paying overpriced food and drink and holding my bladder or number of other issues no pause nothing."
2021-05-31 10:37:29,wallstreetbets,Boomer spotted 😁
2021-05-31 15:25:26,wallstreetbets,"I go to theaters where they serve actual food and drinks, and have zero tolerance policies for noise and phone usage.  So yea, I’d rather get a full freshly cooked meal for the price of a tub of popcorn.  No one wants to pay for overpriced candy and popcorn anymore, people just bring their own stuff."
2021-05-31 12:58:54,wallstreetbets,So you basically just don’t like going to any event. Because you’ve just described 95% of shows and indoor activities
2021-05-31 14:16:14,wallstreetbets,"Fuck your bitter, I hope that life is fun?"
2021-05-31 15:43:08,wallstreetbets,"It is no longer acceptable to bring your own candy and drinks, let’s be honest, it’s stealing. If we like great movies, we need to support the industry and the venues that fund them."
2021-05-31 13:11:34,wallstreetbets,"Most events unless it's a boring speaker aren't crammed into a 2 hour session where you can't blink or use the bathroom and miss a huge chunk of plot that will have to be filled in when the film is released outside of theatres.

It's funny no one wants to see the theaters innovate, just be lazy greedy pieces that sell overpriced junk, lol.

Want better from these places and more people would go to the movies. Kids rather be on a tablet all day."
2021-05-31 19:48:56,wallstreetbets,"$15 for a tub of popcorn is stealing too, and it’s always been against the rules to bring your own food, that’s never stopped anyone though."
2021-05-31 15:46:52,wallstreetbets,"Relax bro, just wait for a good spot and run to take a leak. It won’t ruin the movie, reserve a spot by the aisle on the app and pre order your snacks."
2021-05-31 15:57:46,wallstreetbets,"Just curious, if you don't believe in amc or the theater industry in general why tf are you here?"
2021-05-31 16:03:06,wallstreetbets,"Oh GME brought me here, I didn't adopt AMC with the rest.
They will need to revamp their market for the future.

To this post specifically, to see people's reasons on throwing life savings on AMC."
2021-05-31 16:17:01,wallstreetbets,"So you believe in GME, which can be replaced with much less effort?

I do my share of gaming and I have absolutely no reason to ever visit a GameStop. I believe they'll be gone long  before AMC/movie-going."

2021-05-30 23:01:30,wallstreetbets,"Watched a guy get fucked like this in a game of three card monte on a subway car once.

Guy sits down in the middle of the car and starts inviting people to play, and I notice two big dudes who were already positioned in front and behind--likely muscle in case things go bad. One of them plays a round for $5 and wins cause the dealer isn't that fast. Clearly planned to chum the waters a bit. A mark sees this, comes up and bets $20, the dealer again plays poorly and the guy wins $40. A little risky, but the dealer's instincts were on point. The mark doesn't stop, and bets $200. Dealer suddenly has the power of ultra instinct, and the guy loses his money (likely, his card wasn't even on the table by the end--dealer was too fast for me to catch the switchup, even though I was watching for it).

Immediately the mark realizes what has happened and gets really upset, starts yelling for his money back. One of the big guys steps up behind him, the dealer stands up and encourages him to take the L, and then the trio get off at the next station. Dude was fuming for the rest of his ride."

2021-05-30 21:57:29,wallstreetbets,"This place is an insight into the mind of the people you want on the other side of your trades. These people predominantly trade off emotion and buy when it feels good, (when somethings way up) and sell when it feels bad (when it’s way down). They chase trades they feel like they missed, they revenge trade, they don’t use risk management...

I’ve avoided this place since I first started trading because I knew I’d just pick up bad habits. Anyone can make money on a trade but to do it consistently you need to make becoming a consistent trader more important than making money and anyone trying to go to the moon is going to have a hard time bridging that gap. 

Good luck to you and remember, you don’t need to know what’s going to happen next to make money, anything can happen, and always predefine the risk of every trade."

That said I’ve done some dumb shit in there too.  Like sell John Deere in exchange for Cat and bought Chevy instead of Ford.  Sold Costco and Tesla.  Etc."

Ethnic divides, social exclusion, a massive socioeconomic gap between rich and poor, high criminality, an extremely expensive higher education and no national health service (the latter blows every European's mind).

2021-05-31 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Give $CCL a chance? I’ve been thinking of what my last option play would be for a while, and I think I’m put some calls on CCL. I think that since this stock has been on recovery since June of last year and has been steadily increasing month to month to over double its previous stock price, and with news of them starting up with cruises again right as the summer travel season kicks off, it would be a slam dunk to put some calls on there. If I go by how much it went up by month to month it could top 40 dollars/share if everything goes well for them. The only thing in the way is the possibility of this year’s hurricane season to have above average activity and people still salty about CEO’s getting raises. Let’s give this a shot. Make bank while basking in the sunlight."
2021-05-30 21:31:35,wallstreetbets,"CCL is at a post COVID high rate now so it could be a sell the news type event since they $15-20 for much of last year.  Not a bad play imo, just a bit late to the party (cruise).

Stock is heavily diluted too so a return to $50 would be unlikely.  Any bad news on restarting and it'll be back under $20.  If they have a good cruise and return to full I wouldn't put it past retail buyers to start piling in (see AMC)."
2021-05-31 07:38:02,wallstreetbets,"You cant just say ""share prices were high before covid they will go back"" without looking at the bigger picture.

It’s currently already valued at its pre pandemic price, just look at the market cap. As you said it is already priced for a perfect outcome and any bad or even some good news will probably be detrimental to the share price.  As things drag on there is also the possibility of more share dilution that IMO will crater the share price."

2021-05-31 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Weekend DD - EV Market and Analysis # Electric Vehicles | Findings, and Discussion

**Recognizing Industry Leaders Across Multiple Segments**

The growth in electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) is climbing; by 2025, EVs and HEVs will account for an estimated 30% of all vehicle sales.\[1\]  The US EV market is expected to reach 6.9M unit sales by 2025.\[2\]  By 2030, Deloitte forecasts China to achieve a domestic market share of around 48% – almost double that of the United States (27%), and Europe should achieve 42%; growth will be accelerated in countries offering incentives.\[3\]

&#x200B;

[Major Market Outlooks - to 2030](https://preview.redd.it/8s96nsg6ba271.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=413dcf673d60a5134ba01ec45762cdc7eb2c0fe2)

While the United States and China have been the two largest markets for EVs, European growth is speeding up. In Q1 2020, European EV sales rose as the overall EV penetration rate increased to 7.5 percent. So far, several countries are discussing additional purchase incentives as part of their economic stimulus programs.

&#x200B;

[penetration growth, Q1 2019 vs Q1 2020](https://preview.redd.it/29n1rgyefa271.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=905b66003433c6d6aea96ca01e17f45fd8cc2f9f)

This transition is accelerated by growth in per-capital income in developing countries. The automotive market in 2025 will see around 120m vehicles sold, with China comprising 35m of sales. Considering the penetration rate for Electric vehicles, we can expect +30m global EV sales, with China and Europe leading at +10.5m and +5m sales, respectively.

&#x200B;

[EV Segments as &#37; of Auto Market](https://preview.redd.it/ievgu8klfa271.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&s=2be5989c166d385389152e51c3a61517c8259327)

For both North America and Europe, hybrids and BEVs are set to lead over the next decade as plug-in hybrids are not proving too popular in either region. In Europe, plug-in electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs) will rise from roughly a 2% share of total new sales in 2017 to around 9% by 2025.

**Moving forward, accurate results and revenue forecasts will be determined by these key questions:**

***1. How is the speed of competition compared to the speed of industry growth?***

***2. What is the efficacy of government incentives on consumers?***

***3. How are startups able to differentiate their products?***

**Segment Discussion**

With these questions, now we examine the segmentation and distribution of the industry. Electric Vehicles have multiple avenues of growth opportunities; some recent developments include startups like Lordstown Motors, Workhorse Group, and Canoo.

https://preview.redd.it/uph3o4wmga271.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fdde0ff0c828bbf9849f656c0a9058aad093e9d

Strong opportunities exist outside consumer vehicles, as the competitive landscape intensifies. Small startups that wish to combine EV and Autonomous Driving technology also try to find their niche in fleet vehicles focused on light-duty and delivery services.

Within consumer vehicles, BEVs and Hybrids are likely to take the lead, with long-term trends favoring BEVs. I believe Plug-In Hybrids in a very awkward position, having to compete against existing hybrid options and new battery vehicles. However, they are also viable in locations with poor charging infrastructure. Specifically, I think two questions will be critical in determining the future of Plug-In Hybrids.  1. How fast is charging infrastructure expanding in relation to EV sales? 2. What are the markets that have high incentives but poor charging infrastructure?

&#x200B;

[Market Remains Fragmented as of 2019](https://preview.redd.it/ctwu1xf4ha271.png?width=1937&format=png&auto=webp&s=7016e710092649594a8054e29f69a55fa9bc4560)

**Conclusion and picks**

Within consumer vehicles, luxury and basic vehicle models must also be distinguished. Thus, we distinguish key winners in their separate spaces.

Within Luxury EVs, NIO is set to be the clear winner with strong growth vs. peers, smart expansion in high-penetration markets, and effective subsidy schemes.

Within normal models, markets continue to remain fragmented as EV companies fail to break out of home markets. Winners likely come from established global brands, like Ford and GM.

In light-duty/transport space, clear leaders in the innovation-production pipeline include Renault-Nissan and BYD.

Safe defensive picks come from large Auto-conglomerates with expansive EV portfolios like BYD, BAIC, and Renault, having a portfolio of products across multiple segments.

2021-05-31 11:19:31,wallstreetbets,Late to the game but FCX & TECK are great copper plays and up huge the past year. RIO has a large copper mine that is supposed to open in Nevada in 2022 but got put back on hold by Biden admin. Looking at the numbers they can't push green new deal without RIO's new mine for cheap local copper.

2021-05-31 09:34:29,wallstreetbets,"It's a distraction because retail money already pales in comparison to hedge fund money. Volume is what is needed for short squeezes, every dollar in a stock that doesn't do shit is less fuel for the fire. 

As far as diversification goes of course everyone should be diversified but if a portion of your portfolio is short squeeze plays, which is clearly many here's goal, then that really should be targeted to the best opportunity rather than spread too thin. I don't see NOK really ever as a play because of the massive float, simple as that.

Does this really need explaining?"

2021-05-30 22:31:03,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm been on reddit 8+ years. He taught most of the sub how to do DD. People actually learned from this man. The fact he’s vilified now really angers me. As I have mentioned in comments before the sub was so small back then “positions or ban” was an actual thing. Loss porn was real, but so was the DD. Coming on the sub now it’s just the blind leading the blind and it’s a lot less funny. I’m just waiting for the next wave after most of the sub gets wiped out."

2021-05-30 23:09:50,wallstreetbets,His finance and investing series was one of the best intro series i’ve ever seen. It gives anincredibly strong foundation to fundamental analysis.
2021-05-30 21:03:16,wallstreetbets,"He is a fraudulent piece of shit. He stole millions of dollars from investors. Fuck that guy. He was such an arrogant, smarmy piece of shit in his daraprim proceedings that the sec had to investigate him. By the end of the trial he had all of his prized possessions seized and he was sobbing and begging the judge for leniency. A real American cunt.

Here is the DOJ report on why he really went to jail. It wasn’t because of price gouging or being a big pharma scapegoat or any of the other dumb shit people on here seem to believe. He is a con man

https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/martin-shkreli-sentenced-seven-years-imprisonment-multi-million-dollar-fraud-scheme"
2021-05-31 04:08:57,wallstreetbets,IIRC it was an incredibly niche drug. Not something insurance companies would raise prices over since only a handful of people actually needed it
2021-05-31 03:06:23,wallstreetbets,If it aint got ODB I got no interest.
2021-05-30 22:36:13,wallstreetbets,"You're in the wrong place.  Shkreli was a mod here for a long time and a frequent contributor to this sub, and was (and still is) quite adored here.  So, fuck off elsewhere with your Shkreli hate."
2021-05-31 08:07:50,wallstreetbets,"The fact hes vilified angers you? He’s a fucking prick who price gouged life saving drugs for people and fucked over other investors 

Sorry you lost your icon"
2021-05-31 00:16:21,wallstreetbets,Ya he gives a pretty thorough tutorial on how to do a discounted cash flow.
2021-05-30 22:25:45,wallstreetbets,Do people forget this..?
2021-05-30 22:25:28,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't this fuck insurance companies more than people?
2021-05-30 23:48:16,wallstreetbets,I thought he still had a pretty decent net worth?
2021-05-31 03:39:11,wallstreetbets,Are the wsb subscribers making more money now than 4 years ago? What is the result? Might be a good thing?
2021-05-31 16:34:55,wallstreetbets,"Makes you realize how much better this sub used to be. It's still entertaining, but that old spark just isn't there anymore"
2021-05-31 14:11:58,wallstreetbets,If you couldn't pay for the drugs you could simply email the company and they were sent for free. I really don't feel bad about him price gouging insurance companies. You should probably read up on what happened instead of listening to MSM.
2021-05-31 16:40:41,wallstreetbets,He also paid the investors back. I remember reading the testimony of one of the people who claimed to have been defrauded admitting that Martin eventually paid him back
2021-05-31 14:12:09,wallstreetbets,Except he gave the drug away for free if you asked. Good to know you are unable to think for yourself/ past watch you watch on Fox News
2021-05-30 21:21:19,wallstreetbets,"> As someone that has worked in the pharmaceutical field

I donno if slanging rocks qualifies"
2021-05-30 23:45:17,wallstreetbets,"He wasn't convicted for jacking up prices of a drug. He was convicted of securities fraud in how he managed hedge funds. And I'm sure you are aware, as a self anointed expert, that drug companies have to make large investments to develop new drugs that may not be successful. Then if they are resourceful enough to develop a winner, they have Generics nipping at their heels in short order. Shkreli didn't develop a new drug. He took a legacy drug and increased the price to a point where people could not afford to pay. He knew there was no readily available replacement and didn't care who it affected as long as he made a big paycheck.

I'm sensing there are a lot of people wanting to defend this modern day Gordon Gekko."
2021-05-31 01:14:37,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but that ends up screwing everyone as well.  Also, its fucked up enough the loophole doesn’t matter."
2021-05-30 21:36:25,wallstreetbets,"Wrong. You could get it free by contacting him or his team. He streamed on youtube often so it would be hard to talk to him. He made big corporations and insurance companies lose tons of money while people who needed it COULD get it. Note it was still being sold for cheap. 

Also Daraprim,the drug he spiked, would make you incredibly sick if you took it."
2021-05-30 20:00:22,wallstreetbets,You have something against capitalism? Wrong sub.
2021-05-31 00:26:20,wallstreetbets,"He owned a ton of nvax stock so uhh, he’s not doing bad"
2021-05-30 21:49:48,wallstreetbets,"Haha no no, legal drug dealer here"
2021-05-31 07:59:12,wallstreetbets,"I never said he was convicted for increasing prices. I explained how he was a sacrificial lamb in the pharmaceutical industry. And that whole using money to develop new products is true but this is where it’s bullshit. Insulin. Take Levemir for example. The flex pen patent was going to expire and going generic. Know what happened? They changed the insulin pen so slightly- took flexpen off the market, renamed it the flex touch and continued patent protection because it has a “new delivery system” and sued anyone trying to make a generic. Or any other insulin for that matter that cost $50 a vial in the early 2000s and is now going for $300 a vial. You’re telling me they are so inefficient that their production costs have spiked that much? No. They know it’s a cash cow and people don’t have any other option so they can fuck them with whatever price they want. They just increase prices gradually every year so that insurance plans don’t change the drug off their formulary. Also a few years back epi pens tripled in price when they went generic. Oh but wait, the brand name company bought out the generic company so they were making both and price gouging. Or wait. A product like Duexis. A RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE WONDER DRUG. 90 tablets costs about $3,000. Know it is? A tablet that contains ibuprofen and Pepcid. 2 of the cheapest fucking drugs on the market, and both OTC. But it’s prescription because it’s a prescribed dose of ibuprofen (800mg) and a dose of Pepcid that is different than OTC (26.6mg while otc is 10 or 20). Yeah, Pharmaceutical companies need to spend lots of money developing new drugs it’s true, but seriously get the fuck out of here with that excuse because it’s bullshit and only being used to justify fucking over people who need this stuff. And btw these are only a few examples of what really goes on"
2021-05-31 09:47:21,wallstreetbets,I take a medication thats like $4k before insurance and $2k after.  But manufacturer has a coupon card that brings it to $35.  I think they're just tryna scam $ from insurance
2021-05-30 20:02:20,wallstreetbets,Not necessarily. It’s the age old battle between capital and labor that deserves some sunlight.
2021-05-31 01:03:29,wallstreetbets,"If I recall correctly, what he did was actually CORRECT but misinterpreted heavily. The regular guys wouldn't pay more for the medicine, their insurance would cover the cost for most of it plus the medicine he made so expensive had some pretty big downsides. He provided a better alternative for it, at a much cheaper cost too.

But don't quote me on that."
2021-05-31 00:29:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah he’s still worth an estimated 20mil from 2020..he’s sitting fine. I think he’s a huge piece of shit, but I do respect his intelligence. I got roasted by this sub for saying that lmao. Like, guys...just because he used to be here and contributed and all that, doesn’t negate how shitty of a human he is lmao."
2021-05-30 20:33:29,wallstreetbets,Except today all you need is a laptop and an idea. The bar for entreprenuership is the lowest it's even been (just talking about the USA here).
2021-05-31 12:42:57,wallstreetbets,"Eh I’d suggest you actually watch his live streams. He was a huge piece of shit to the media and insurance companies - because why not, they both suck. These giant companies made sure to launch a huge smear campaign, which is what the general public saw. 


Behind the scenes he taught finance and chemistry better than any professor I had in school. He was about 90% towards having a cure for toxoplasmosis, which would make the markup cost for Daraprim a moot point. He had a program 1800-free-Daraprim for anyone that couldn’t afford it, he paid out of his own money. He helped bring to light the common practice of drug gouging. 


He had the only fraud case in the state of NY where every investor suing him made over $1M in profit. And he went to jail because he sent a political tweet. 


Now, the question remains... why doesn’t anyone care about drug prices? Insulin is still overpriced, etc. And the answer is once he was arrested they stopped the smear campaign. 


His plan was never to be a likable person, he has pretty strong autism tbh. But he did have goals that he regularly achieved. Whether or not the livestreams were of good conscious or a play for the judge or just being bored on house arrest, idk.... but the dude has helped way way way more people than he’s hurt, he just did it in an obnoxious way."

2021-05-31 01:34:24,wallstreetbets,"Bank accounts are insured by FDIC up to only 250k. 2 problems with this if the deposit is one that would go to an MMF (large corp, funds etc): 

1. This account is costly for banks to maintain since they have to pay the insurance fee and it's usually a large sum, so they have to hold more capital to comply with SLR. Banks do not want to hold this money since it's ""flighty"".
2. Only insured up to 250k. Gov MMFs are basically guaranteed 1 NAV and prime MMFs are only a smidge less secure. They are also much more liquid and easy to get in and out with less regs etc."
2021-05-31 11:00:25,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I am wrong… but reverse repo are 24h contracts, no?

So what “surplus” of treasuries is there? They PAY interest to hold the treasury so the balance sheet looks good to the big man and then give them back at the end of the day, rinse and repeat. 

They don’t own the treasury afaik, just on loan."
2021-05-31 01:41:17,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the info. It seems to me that beyond your 3 or 6-month emergency fund, and any other cash you need immediately on hand in the next 3 months, it's not worth holding a single cent in the bank, whether savings or MMF or CD."
2021-05-31 13:06:26,wallstreetbets,"If you repeat that overnight operation for months on end, there isn’t a functional difference between an overnight sell, and a permanent one.

My point was that OP was saying the private market had too many treasuries. QE is literally the govt buying treasuries in exchange for cash. A reverse repo is the government putting treasuries back into the private market in exchange for cash. 

If both the supply of treasuries and the supply of cash are both easily manipulated by the fed, then the rate of both interest and inflation are easily manipulated by the fed. This is why runaway inflation won’t happen."
2021-05-31 01:35:56,wallstreetbets,"It's not to avoid SLR, you can't avoid it. It's to comply with SLR. This is actually regs in place to make sure banks can withstand substantial losses from market movements and still be solvent."
2021-05-31 09:33:20,wallstreetbets,"If you're talking about credit risk, I think this is misguided. A bank is insured by the gov (up to FDIC limit) and MMFs are basically for those who are unable to get better rates from banks. If you're talking about yield then yes there are much better options higher along the risk curve, this is actually the intended effect."
2021-05-31 10:55:21,wallstreetbets,"Ding ding.

They don’t want people sitting on cash.

Moving cash is healthy cash.

Cash that sits does NOTHING. 

They want people to invest, spend, that whole song and dance, because if the money doesn’t move, the economy doesn’t grow. In the banks sense, they make money off lending money, not holding money. Money is a liability.

People seem to think wealthy people have a massive bank account with billions in it, I’d say… no. Its spread out, sitting in stocks and capital (real estate for example), maybe they have some spendy account, but the majority of their money is being used to make money."

If I’m annoying please tell me to fk off.  Also curious what your plays are then for the next couple years.  From all I’ve seen... might buy puts into a fiscal cliff in 2022, then ride it back up."
2021-05-31 01:39:57,wallstreetbets,"IOER is set by the Fed and it's a ceiling (ON RRP is currently the ""effective"" floor), as long as the Fed avoids even talking about negative rates, negative IOER won't happen.

FWIW, I don't think central banks should avoid negative rates. In fact, if negative rates were used more often, sooner and more aggressively, interest rates would usually be much higher than they are right now."
2021-05-31 09:31:01,wallstreetbets,"The point of these regs isn't that they plan on adverse market shocks, but to make sure that banks can still be solvent if they do indeed occur. No one planned for the subprime crisis, so the leverage ratios came about as a way to cushion potential blows that no one can foresee."
2021-05-31 15:55:32,wallstreetbets,There is nothing I can find that stops the FED from setting whatever rate they want. In fact not that long ago they did it. It could be leveraged to encourage banks to loan the excess reserves. No clue if they would actually do it. I disagree on negative rates.

2021-05-30 20:47:09,wallstreetbets,"Strike price plus avg price is the break even price. Those are $15 calls ( strike price) but the break even is $18.97 because the $3.97 avg cost per share paid for the conract. 1 call contract allows him to buy 100 shares at $15 , plus the $3.97 op paid per share for the contract.  The cost of the contract has grown x% above the $3.97 original purchase price, that's where the gains are from. The break even price is if the call expires in the money and op exercises the contract to buy 100 shares at strike price $15 it would be costing him $18.97 per share."
2021-05-30 21:44:19,wallstreetbets,"I don't think so, they had a successful test flight but they aren't doing commercial flights yet. I would still but. Also, Boeing is heavily invested and they are looking at the possibility of using their (virgins) plane for faster intercontinental travel too.

2021-05-30 20:54:34,wallstreetbets,"Got it so basically he bought a contract that says you can buy 100 shares of a stock for the strike price which is $15. And the goal is for the stock to go over $15 per share, so that when you buy the 100 shares you have immediate gains. Or is the goal to sell the contract over the strike price so you make a profit, then the person buying the contract can also make those gains?

Or do you want the stock to go over the break even price so that you’re profitable?"

2021-05-30 21:59:19,wallstreetbets,So can you exercise the contract before hand to get your profit ?? Or do you have to wait until the due date?

2021-05-30 21:05:34,wallstreetbets,"If op holds the contracts untill expiration and the op exercised them ( buy said 100 shares)  for $18.97 op can. But would be ideal to sell the contracts to reap those gains. Right now op would pay 18.97 a share and we can buy them for $30 respectively, selling them would net a profit and if they expired at share price of $30 he would make a profit from buying shares under $19 and being able to sell them from 30."

2021-05-30 21:59:13,wallstreetbets,Do some research amigo. Just as with buying shares  it depends on the volume.  I wouldn't touch options untill you fully understand. Do some research and learn. I wish you luck

2021-05-30 20:31:27,wallstreetbets,"how are you executing orders, manually? what does the output of this thing look like in that css file? is it just giving you a range of scores to tell you give or take when to buy in?  


how do you determine your position size and stop loss to tell the bots when to get you out? im guessing youre just manually trading and this just gives you a monthly look ahead based on sentiment?

can you tell me more about your execution game?"

OP isn't talking source material, he's talking MSM spin on it and I told him the truth. You told me what I told him, minus the personal bullshit. The entities he referenced never did and never will tell the truth about the primary fact of the game stop phenomena and that's the insane levels of shorting that went on and continues.

Nothing is stopping you from telling this dumbass how it keeps squeezing despite your information being indisputably, inviolably accurate, but condescension and name calling suits you better anyway, genius. Go fuck yourself."

2021-05-31 03:06:56,wallstreetbets,I used PornHub. Searched “option trading” and watched the video where a sorority girl traded the “p” for homework.  Wonder if she got an “A” in the college course.
2021-05-31 08:28:35,wallstreetbets,"My tinfoil hat on $BB - The reason it is up is because shorts were profitable on it...they needed to realize that profit by buying the stock back this past week in order to avoid getting margin called from all the price action on $AMC. If you look at charts of $SNDL, $SOS, $BB and I'm sure a few others...you will notice the same pattern. They all started to run a little bit on Wednesday 05/26. $AMC had been running for almost 7 straight trading days before these guys started to move.

&#x200B;

I also think them covering their shorts does two things...they can not only get some of that profit back, but they can run the stock up that they've been holding down for so long. What does that do? Distracts the apes from $AMC thinking, ""Oh shit, I gotta get my $$$ over to the new play quick!"". Anyways, I like $BB as a company a ton, but make no mistake....$AMC is the squeeze play, period."
2021-05-30 20:30:58,wallstreetbets,"Traditionally we see dips around 11am-12pm ET.. I would wait for the first big dip and take advantage if that's where you want your money.

It's more risky as you can lose everything if you're not careful, but the upside if you are right is pretty ridiculous as well. I don't use RH, I use webull for options trading.

2021-05-31 03:35:44,wallstreetbets,Wow!  September is so expensive... I agreed.  Which strike price would you recommend? And what would be  the best limit price?

2021-05-31 11:23:16,wallstreetbets,I started with like my savings of $5k near end of Feb and scraped together another few grand instead of paying bills haha.. I did what you are not supposed to and overleveraged on something I believed in. That top screenshot was pretty much all I had and just suffered for a few months.
2021-05-31 00:41:36,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-30 20:35:51,wallstreetbets,"You pay your strike price. Not only that you have to have settled cash to exercise them. So it's rare to exercise usually you just sell for the value of the contracts. How much money can you lose? I mean.. 100% haha. Like, if your strike is $10 and the stock is running at $30 .. .your contract lets you exercise each option (x 100 shares) at $10 per share."

2021-05-30 20:49:20,wallstreetbets,"Ah, so correct me if I’m wrong but if I wanted to have the stocks that were ITM, GME/AMC I would have to purchase the value that’s correspondent with the NYSE and not get a discount? Unless I take the monetary value of the contract?"
2021-05-31 08:06:47,wallstreetbets,Pretty solid if you ask me
2021-05-30 22:53:52,wallstreetbets,Should be a given.
2021-05-30 21:35:14,wallstreetbets,"That's a fine interpretation and I was about to wax logical but nothing is logical anymore.  BB changed nearly their entire business model to be more fluid with digital transformation in general so I would like to say their squeeze is coming sooner and stronger.

2021-05-30 20:01:01,wallstreetbets,"The advantage for me is that you can take advantage of big moves on large caps without having to pay the stock price.

Tesla, for example, can move 30 dollars in a day but instead of paying 630 per share, you are essentially paying 5 a share as long as you sell before expiration.

Stocks like Tesla, Nio, and Pltr are easy to scalp options in this way because they usually respect the open range low and open range high. Tesla flush at open, buy option. It climbs back up, sell."
2021-05-31 10:57:30,wallstreetbets,"I personally like ITM or slightly outside of the money. I don’t like to shoot for the moon with options, if you think it’s gonna go up 50% just buy shares IMO"

 Bought 5/28 nio 34 and 35 calls when it was at 32 2 weeks ago. Bought pltr 5/28 20 c when it was at 17.

Still have thirty 20.5 6/11 and 15 22 6/11 for pltr. And 50 40 c 6/11 nio."

2021-05-30 20:32:44,wallstreetbets,I am eyeing the Nov 30 c for pltr myself. I really think it makes another move to all time highs this year and maybe even 60 but I am not great at timing so don't mind paying the premium for not having to time it perfectly.
2021-05-30 20:46:27,wallstreetbets,"I do near term strikes, can be weekly or monthly. 

Example this past week was 22.50, which rolled 1/4 to 30c June with profits and 1/4 into 30c next week. All the are runners, I mentally can’t afford the the bandwidth to take 6 Month out premiums…..unless I’m doing it for the following year and that’s different type of trade."

2021-05-30 20:55:36,wallstreetbets,"I take near term strikes primarily as well, but they have to be within the price action channel for me. 30c would require a break out, hence longer term to me. But they are so cheap near term that it's probably fine as lotto

22.5 is a perfect near term strike to buy at 9:45-10 am after an opening bell flush."

I think this only works on large caps and it's very important to learn the personality of the specific stock(they all have unique personalities and react to QQQ/SPY as well as sector sympathy in different ways. If you have a good grasp on that, it should work.

You could make a pretty good loving buying and selling tesla calls and puts everyday."

2021-05-31 13:37:44,wallstreetbets,"lel srsly, excactly the same happened to me this year earlier. Did some bad stuff, landed at a mental closed hospital, without wifi/mobilephones for a week and i put 1-2 day before  a  good amount of money into some trades  (that i shouldnt loose into it). 

i litterally nearly freaked out a second time because of this lel."
2021-05-31 04:15:05,wallstreetbets,This happened to me with TLRY.  I bought $20 calls for January 22.  I bought them in January 2020 on whim.  Over the year I watched them collapse in value but bought more to average down my price.  The week before I saw the price go up suddenly.  But I think it would have to triple in a week in order for me to break even.  I knew there was a chance but didn't hold my breath.  Day by day I watched the price get closer and closer to $20.  Finally the day I'd been waiting for for almost a year had finally arrived.  The market had opened and my options were suddenly in the money for the first time ever.  The price was heading north of $23.  I set a sell limit of $25 and hoped for the best.  Went to sleep.  When I woke up my options had expired worthless as the price had dropped to $19.  I was an idiot for not exercising them instead.  I think shortly after this it hit $60.
2021-05-30 21:26:08,wallstreetbets,"Oh isn't 4"" big?"
2021-05-31 09:48:18,wallstreetbets,"You mean intrinsic here and theta is at it's minimum at expiry. Intrinsic value is max(stock-strike, 0) and extrinsic is the time value with sensitivity of the call value to time measured by theta. That drops off very sharply to close to zero at 0DTE"

2021-05-31 01:09:32,wallstreetbets,Love the TA on this. This bullish momentum will continue after some consolidation as seen on Friday. The price will continue to rise. As well as holding its a great one to day trade to lock in further profit. It's great cos your adding to the price as zi use all profit from the day trade to purchase more shares at a lower price thus strengthening the stock price.

2021-05-31 06:58:48,wallstreetbets,Frankfurt pre-market +14%. FOMO or buy the dip?
2021-05-30 22:41:06,wallstreetbets,"Personally, if I can avoid it, I never hold long options in the last 30 days before expiration since theta decay is exponential in that last month. If I were in that position, I would sell the options at the next rally and rollover my position to longer dated options, like July or august to maintain exposure."
2021-05-30 22:37:46,wallstreetbets,Official percentage of float short is around 20%. Seems low considering all the synthetic shorts out there.
2021-05-31 10:45:53,wallstreetbets,Theta decay will bite hard. That’s why I got July calls. Your call!! 😉
2021-05-31 13:47:50,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣
2021-05-31 00:55:06,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the reply! I am down $21k so if I can recover at least half I will get out and go for a longer options like you said. If you do see anything specific or special on Tuesday please post. Keep up the good work. Appreciate it!!!
2021-05-30 22:43:18,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-05-31 00:08:31,wallstreetbets,"I don't know a lot about this, but are you worried about the ability to reset the clock on these FTDs? Apparently naked short sellers can reset the clock to avoid their obligation to buy real shares. It seems like they may just keep kicking the can down the road. Again, I am not an expert, and I appreciate your response to my first question.

2021-05-31 07:03:56,wallstreetbets,I am only concerned about how much pain they are willing to take before covering. This is the only thing that matters to me.
2021-05-31 14:33:34,wallstreetbets,"Yes!! 3k-5k per share. Just look at the volume in the last 2 trading days which is (1,354,874,511) 1.354 Billion and the shares outstanding for AMC is 450.28 Million (450,280,000). You believe that the whole float of AMC was traded 3X the outstanding shares in 2 days. Unrealistic. It does not make any sense. Just wait I predict the volume on Tuesday will be around 800 Million."
2021-05-31 14:27:16,wallstreetbets,no one knows who is holding synthetic shares since the only thing you are given is a digital certificate. Not a real share and you can create unlimited digital certificates. But we will know after the close of June 2nd how many shares are circulating in the market.
2021-05-31 01:40:56,wallstreetbets,Good luck. I just did the put spreads on AMC. I could care less what happens for the next month

2021-05-31 00:26:22,wallstreetbets,"Nothing but respect for DFV, he got a movement going. The main factor to driving the frenzy in each stock is short interest, each stock will have factors so yeah none are going to play out the same but if DFV is all in GME then that doesn’t mean the rest of us autists can’t go all in on AMC. We like these stocks , we like short sellers being on the wrong end. We’re all a movement , just getting there in a different car."

2021-05-30 23:19:17,wallstreetbets,"Depending how Infrastructure talks go this week I’m expecting Chargepoint (Chpt) to go up if progress is made. However, they are probably going to fluff up excitement for the Ford+ partnership and the rise in Tesla and other electric car sales. But they are down YTD. I’ll probably buy a few cheap calls and shares.            
I expect Zoom to go down. Alternatives are growing and people are going back. Then again I said the same thing last quarter.           
Docusign I’m seeing more of, but that’s anecdotal."

2021-05-31 00:32:03,wallstreetbets,Short Lands End if you can. Not as many people in the work place to sell uniforms too and such. People are working from home and such more as well. Just my guess but I’m thinking they’re going to show some huge losses year over year. I also think that bc last year a bunch of the companies buy all their attire in March or Sometimes as early as February bc it’s the beginning of the fiscal year. That means they’d already bought a ton of stuff last year before Covid hit really hard here in the states. This shouldn’t really cause too big of an issues but I still think it drops YOY. Now 2022 should be even worse IMO. However people are hiring more and more people once this stimulus money runs out so you never know about next years numbers really.

The analyst commented, ""The deal is expected to close by 4Q21. Though the company is acquiring a conventional energy-products asset, management intends to unlock value though an additional $85M investment in leveraging the asset's unique hydrocracking capability to produce renewable diesel. Management expects renewable diesel contribution at around 10,000 barrels per day to begin within around nine months post the closing of the transaction, with ramp to 14,000 barrels per day by March 2023. Management is guiding for $3B in revenues and $400M in gross profits from the Mobile refinery for 2023. Taking into account this outlook we are now revising our revenue and adjusted EBITDA expectations for Vertex in 2023 from $246.0M and $25.5M to $2.9B and $319.7M, respectively, positioning the company for a potential 10x-plus improvement in adjusted EBITDA in around 24 months. We are projecting 2022 revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings of $2.2B, $158.6M, and $1.37 per share, respectively, compared to $281.5M, $12.2M, and a loss of $0.09 per share, in 2021. This translates to revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth rates of 692% and 1200%, respectively, in 2022. Similarly, our 2023 revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings of $2.9B, $319.7M, and $3.12 per share, respectively, represent YoY growth of 28.5%, 101.5%, and 127.7%, respectively. At our $25 price target the company would continue to trade at very reasonable 2023 EV/adjusted EBITDA and P/E multiples of 4.0x and 8.0x, with a PEG ratio of 0.20x, which is well below 1.00x."

RKT does mortgages, homes, autos and much more. Google how many companies RKT owns. Additionally, Rocket Homes app generates revenue through ads and will eventually grow big enough to compete with Zillow. This should be well above $50 right now. $250 long term"
2021-05-31 11:16:09,wallstreetbets,Better play in regards to what ??? They uwmc have one income stream and rkt is eating that stream there is a reason on lowered forward on margins ... rkt is taking market share ... this is a growth play once growth is confirmed by market 100 bil market cap .... rkt has 20 different growth streams once they can substantial share of entire market mortgages will just be piece of the pie not majority ... 90 percent retention rate equivalent to now rocket Hathaway

2021-05-31 14:05:01,wallstreetbets,"I agree uwmc is a double (maybe triple) bagger at best and long term rkt is probably a better investment that can run a lot farther than that but I am living in the now and with the share buyback as well as dividends already happening in umwc I see it doubling (maybe tripling) before rkt hits $30/share price again. This is excluding possibility of short squeeze on either stock which both have some potential for as well. UMWC has a lot more positive momentum right now than rkt imo and will payout divies and tendies this year. Longer term RKT is a great investment, I never said it was bad, just UMWC is the better play right now. I'm a retard so this not advice just my tarded pinion. Thanks."

A part of you hopes she destroys your soft spot, or uses it like Dracula might. But she doesn't. She tastes it, hard, but not so hard to damage. She makes full use of it, of you. In a way no one--including yourself--ever has.

Hours later, after much less subtle acts, you find yourself touching your neck. Soft or not, you know you want to be chin to the sky.

2021-05-31 06:20:54,wallstreetbets,"Quote from Motley:

“[wallstreetbets] spread misinformation about the role institutional investors have played with AMC and perpetuate wild conspiracy theories of how the investing world works.

They've claimed hedge funds tried to bankrupt AMC, and that the share price will rise because retail traders now ""control the float."" 

Neither statement is accurate. Company actions and operating results determine whether a company goes bankrupt or succeeds, no matter how many hedge funds short it or how many retail traders own it.”

You open Robinhood and stare flatly at the mausoleum of your positions. The phrase ""blood red"" always annoyed you. Blood has a purpose. The motor oil of the heart, the wet lipstick on the vulva of a healthy pussy, the residue on hands and knees after a day's hard work. This red is purposeless. Fraudulent. An ephemeral falsehood. A blip on the way to a new, manufactured, lobbied-for ATH.

There was a time when options were the pork on your portfolio--unasked for additions, sneaking in under the banner of more ""responsible"" purchases of shares. Now they frolic across your portfolio, drunkenly living violently exciting, but short, lives.

Rising interest rates would cause TSLA to go down relative to GOOG/FB being the net present value of their future profits would be discounted.

The Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on inflation and interest rates rising."

This should be extremely disconcerting information. Look how much the fed has sold lately especially over the last week. The T word is coming at the June FOMC and possibly sooner. They have SOLD 1/2 trillion of treasuries in the last two weeks. Suddenly that $120b of monthly purchasing looks like a joke. Well we knew they couldn't add to the balance sheet forever with inflation running so rampant. We are on the cusp of the crash. It will be here by end of June. And we're talking 50%+ index corrections people. It's getting scary in here. Ye bulls have been warned

You may be right as far as straight out balls to the wall legalization, but have been moving toward this goal for a long time, both sides are on board.

But at least three Dem senators have said they won’t vote for it and Biden doesn’t seem interested which means you would need at least 13 Republican senators to vote for legalization.  If the bill was straight legalization I can think of 4 who would maybe consider voting for it, but the bill that’s going to pass in the house has a bunch of other conditions / “reparations” measures that not a single republican would consider.  If the next president is a democrat they might be able to ram it through as a part of budget reconciliation if they get 3-4 new dem senators, that’s the only way I see it happening"

2021-05-30 20:52:48,wallstreetbets,If you execute 1 contract you are buying the shares at the strike price doesn't matter how high the stock is at the time of execution; you then resell the stock at the higher price and you have your profit.  To execute a contract you have to have enough money to buy 100 shares per contract. If you don't you trade the option to buy the shares (contract) you still pocket the difference between what you paid ex: $.50 x 100= $50. When you closed your position you sold at $1.50 x 100 = $150. Didn't need that much investment to triple your money. Now do some math on what was shown above

2021-05-31 11:37:02,wallstreetbets,"Playing with one of my retirement funds that got decimated by ex. 3800 shares $8.55, bought another 100 at $8.05. Bought 10 6/18 10c and 10 6/18 8p, price was $.20 each took all day to fill on friday, but finally did near close."

2021-05-31 14:05:46,wallstreetbets,I’m asking him if it’s an MLM
2021-05-31 16:14:17,wallstreetbets,Understandable...not long ago this was a 2-3 dollar stock. Maybe buy back with half the money and put the rest back into vanguard or something similar. I think BCRX will be worth 20 by the end of the year and who knows how much after that.
2021-05-30 22:32:13,wallstreetbets,"Some things to consider... if they go ipo through a spac or general public offering, then they will likely list at $10 or more. That is IF they go public. If they don’t your investment will likely keep dropping as they will be needing more capital to continue with zero income. Why haven’t they tried to go spac already? Likely they have and the big boys aren’t interested....

I haven’t invested and likely won’t but I see three scenarios: the opportunity to make 25%+ in the next year if you sell when they go public. You hold long long (3-5 years) and gain 1000% or it dwindles to $0-1 before they call it quits."
2021-05-31 03:24:05,wallstreetbets,Нет
2021-05-30 23:18:07,wallstreetbets,I'm a fan.
2021-05-30 23:23:13,wallstreetbets,sell covered calls and use that premium to put on leaps. IV is too high the profit id keep on the side in cash until the drop then use that cash to buy shares.  Use you call sell money for the option plays

2021-05-31 10:14:24,wallstreetbets,"This is why I don’t hold any shares on rh, I just utilize their instant money I don’t actually have buy a deep item call and sell it each time it spikes and rebuy on a strong attack einer repeat that funds the shares held in 4 separate accounts 2 Webull fidelity and etrade … think I’ll move Webull’s to thinkorswim since I’ve noticed Fidelity’s app goes down sometimes. But I’ll keep Webull for the 4am-8pm benefit"
2021-05-31 11:13:10,wallstreetbets,🙂To the MOON SpaceApes! We OWN the float and we set the price. #AMC500K 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-31 17:54:18,wallstreetbets,"Hot damn congrats man, that’s must be looking nice even if it’s just 30 shares, that’s a lot more than I have now :)"
2021-05-30 20:22:33,wallstreetbets,"In addicted to their cheap margin. It’s one hell of a drug. 

Ultimately might check out interactive brokers, but their fees are pretty nuts"
2021-05-30 20:22:52,wallstreetbets,Robinhood
2021-05-30 20:21:17,wallstreetbets,Not quite. I paid about $175 for each contract. More like $175 to $2350

2021-05-30 20:27:38,wallstreetbets,"Ya, I just checked and it’s 3.37 percent. I have faith it will get close to the price though."
2021-05-30 20:29:27,wallstreetbets,Got in at at 0.29
2021-05-30 20:37:05,wallstreetbets,Friday’s 8.5% to 1% was frustrating but maybe the start of a serious run. Who knows
2021-05-31 13:35:24,wallstreetbets,"BYND is a desperate attempt by Shitadel to avoid margin calls! They are long in this stock, only helps them"
2021-05-31 13:34:27,wallstreetbets,"Other goal: Citadel and Ken Griffin are long in BYND! By using fake media to announce fake squeezes of this and TLRY, they can get FOMO to drive these up and then collect the gains and tank it"
2021-05-31 13:32:35,wallstreetbets,9th was spending that dollar pinned to your chest on more $BYND
