2021-05-26 19:55:44,wallstreetbets,"Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Look stage analyses and Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms."
2021-05-26 19:58:31,wallstreetbets,"If we were in a bubble they wouldn't say a damn thing! 

let's see there's a shortage of lumber and other assets needed to build a house,  Biden has threaten to tax the hell out of stocks, so it makes sense that not only is there a shortage of materials, ie supply and demand, but people are moving their assets into real estate, All reasons for housing prices to rise, bubbles exist for no reason."
2021-05-26 19:54:26,wallstreetbets,"In the end, what do you have to lose by diversifying out of some of your dollar reserves and into physical metal? This is precisely what many central banks around the globe have been doing at a record pace over the last 24 months, and if it's a good idea for them, why isn't it a good idea for you?"
2021-05-26 19:59:18,wallstreetbets,I’m not too convinced on gold because it has an inverse relationship to fiat but limited transferability.  Seems like some end of the worlders are banking on it preserving wealth but their strategies don’t seem aligned.  But we’ll see.

2021-05-26 19:46:10,wallstreetbets,"Actually I just listened to this live, he likes wsb and is rooting for us. First 10-15 min were a ranting warning to heggies, to basically fuck off or join us. Legit said we underestimate our power as a community of like (enuf) minded (or what passes for it her) people. Even gave some examples of potential other stocks with 22% shorted shares. Mho, but maybe the weird fuck will rally behind us. Maby ,He has turned to the stonk side........"
2021-05-26 19:54:49,wallstreetbets,Could be important information. However I refuse to read it in its current format....

2021-05-26 19:49:12,wallstreetbets,"In order to set a stop-limit, you first set your stop price (what triggers the stop) then your limit price (the lowest you’re willing to accept) you are simply trying it backwards that’s all"
2021-05-26 19:52:19,wallstreetbets,A stop loss goes in reverse. The value dropping to a certain amount and you placing a limit as to how low you'll accept to sell the shares for. You should be keeping it at a cent apart anyway if you actually plan on selling 100 shares.
2021-05-26 19:47:42,wallstreetbets,A day trader that doesn’t know how to trade ? Unfortunately I saw tons of them! He will lose everything 🤦‍♂️
2021-05-26 19:45:15,wallstreetbets,"Your second pic shows you what you did wrong, if you think really hard I’m sure you can figure it out. Nothing illegal here just literally an improper attempted sell."
2021-05-26 19:49:53,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been daytrading GME and amc for months, my bank is swollen thanks to diamond hand morons 😂😂"
2021-05-26 19:51:35,wallstreetbets,"So they want me to sell for a cheap ass price (217 or less) if the stock goes down to a certain point (10% from now) but might not continue to go down (below 200) low enough to warrant such a sell if the aim was too take the profit of sellin at 240 (lock it in now for when the price drops that far is ndicating a huge dip)??


Remember: hypothetical for educational purposes only right now cuz I completely missed a step out my asshole which ain't my fault cuz somebody fed me glass in 2009 so my hemorrhoids got little glass holes making my asshole extremely holy and bloody every time I have a bowel movement hence I have nothing else to lose"

2021-05-26 19:52:50,wallstreetbets,"You set both those values, it’s your decision"
2021-05-26 19:51:56,wallstreetbets,"No I’m a trader, love using this sub to pad my bank account you morons are the most gullible bunch I’ve ever seen 😂😂 so thanks!"
2021-05-26 19:53:18,wallstreetbets,"True that is how I was led to believe it is supposed to work, but this app is preventing that."
2021-05-26 19:53:50,wallstreetbets,"And with this app preventing that legal method of trading, what the actual shit???"
2021-05-26 19:54:33,wallstreetbets,Oh the app isn’t letting you change the values?? That is an issue I’d reach out to your broker and see why
2021-05-26 19:58:32,wallstreetbets,No I'm trying to lock in this current price of 240 something to sell if the price plummets overnight or by tomorrow as low as 10% so that I can get that money and then buy more later on when it's cheaper than 218 or 10% lower than 240 cuz that's what I was led to understand through the training. This was for practice to see if it would work and it did not work like I was led to believe it was supposed to work.
2021-05-26 19:59:35,wallstreetbets,Ok so set both values to that same price. With my app I have to set both the stop and limit price to the same value for it to work
2021-05-26 19:28:10,wallstreetbets,This is greatness!!!! Good job fellow ape!!!

Currently, there is a crisis brewing. If this crisis is realized, then silver will do fine. If this is again 'averted', then silver will go down. 

Just like any assets, it has boom and bust. I held zero gold/silver until 2021, but I have 5% there now and 95% cash."

Pretty much foolproof...I don’t have enough in my account to be a day trader so I do it once or twice a week If the price movement is good and then wait till the day trades fall off and do it again. I sat out today thank god and watched my GME rise back from the ashes... so my question is, do you buy further out, weeklies, or daily’s in my instance lol. I follow your DD closely because your analysis is teaching me a lot."

2021-05-26 18:41:02,wallstreetbets,They’ll lie about the numbers if they’re bad.
2021-05-26 19:07:33,wallstreetbets,What's bad numbers though? If unemployment is high it's been good for the market because it will slow down interest rates. If unemployment is low it's good because the economy is getting back on track.

If those numbers don't end up being horrendous I'll wait till the NEXT earnings release and buy MORE puts

Rinse and repeat till the lotto machine goes DING"
2021-05-26 18:29:01,wallstreetbets,Wanna start a support group for all the victims of ViaSat?..... I'll be your first member.
2021-05-26 19:06:56,wallstreetbets,"I'm not claiming VSAT is run by incompetent people. Just that they are about to get out competed for 100% of the rural residential, rural business, airline and cruise line markets. 

StarLink is higher bandwidth, lower latency, less expensive and with global coverage when it becomes fully operational over the next 6 to 9 months. I'm willing to bet that come August, but if not definitely November they will be reporting a major drop in revenue from residential customers to StarLink. At which point Barrons and Forbes and all of them will start writing about how StarLink is this 'came out of nowhere company' that is providing something that has never existed (truly global, high speed low latency relatively cheap internet) and the VSAT is gonna lose a BIG chunk of their market cap.

Not saying they are going to zero but a huge loss in value, if properly planned for, can make a lot of money"
2021-05-26 19:21:53,wallstreetbets,"honestly - if you were to review my ETrade account over the past 3 months that would be 100% the right call. I'm taking solace in knowing that the market has been brutal to many active investors so I'm not alone.

Either way - you have my gathered facts and the analysis I came up with so you can make your own decision.

\-Cheers"
2021-05-26 18:51:28,wallstreetbets,hm? are you required to disclose positions when posting? I don't currently have any on VSAT but intend to start buying long duration puts shortly before the next earnings report which will be in August
2021-05-26 18:58:10,wallstreetbets,They released yesterday didn't they?
2021-05-26 18:31:51,wallstreetbets,"Lol you poor soul. I was okay with the slower speeds until three days in they cut me down 85% because we used our allotted 300gb,... ohh I could pay ANOTHER 85/month to up that to 500....

We use about 1500/month. So glad I found another option.

Also support is for pussies, just get revenge by shorting this every chance you get."
2021-05-26 19:21:53,wallstreetbets,"Ya I'm just saying their tech is better suited in other hands, so wouldn't be suprised by a buyout. The starlink 'gonna eat their lunch any day' has been like that for 2+ years.  I do agree everything they do sucks and deserve to go down, but just don't see it"
2021-05-26 19:10:25,wallstreetbets,"yeah. I just had this thought yesterday and went looking for their ER which... was yesterday. which was kind of weird but w/e, maybe I read something about it and it got stuck in my mind.

Regardless they showed solid revenue growth and they also just signed an expanded deal with Delta which analysts are saying could cause the stock price to get up to the mid $60s.

I'm going to be putting money on long puts, which I'll start my position in right before next earnings release, to try and make some money on the news wave that comes from them losing their entire rural residential and rural business market share to a company that barely existed 2 years ago"
2021-05-26 18:35:35,wallstreetbets,just imagine how many of the people that are STILL stuck with them are gonna jump ship once Starlink is finally wide open for new user registration. Right now they are only accepting a limited number of people in each region and most people don't seem to know this thing exists. Once they flip the switch you are gonna have thousands of customers jumping ship a day. I wana see that reflected in quarterly numbers while I watch my puts :)
2021-05-26 19:56:07,wallstreetbets,**The starlink 'gonna eat their lunch any day' has been like that for 2+ years** \- over those two years StarLink has gone from launching a handful of test satellites to where they are today - offering limited users access across the entire USA and Canada in addition to parts of Europe. They are on track to have full coverage with no user caps in the USA and Canada and limited service across the entire globe by early next year.
2021-05-26 18:53:00,wallstreetbets,Providing internet to people isn’t all Viasat does... have you looked at the defense contracting side of ViaSat? There’s a reason the DoD keeps pouring money into contracts with them
2021-05-26 18:56:36,wallstreetbets,"sure - agree with you 100%. I'm not saying that they will lose ALL business. Their will still be value in their satellites to carry traffic for customers that want specific capabilities that go far beyond what your home / cruise / airplane would require (DOD) or that want to have some or all of their traffic on an alternate to StarLink for whatever reason.

But the addressable market and the truly lucrative contracts with airlines and cruise lines are going to be lost to them. And that hit in revenue should take the stock down a serious peg or two. I'm not predicting they go out of business completely."

2021-05-26 17:03:16,wallstreetbets,Are the $40 AMC’s selling if you tried? That’s a nice gain on a (debatably) long shot call

2021-05-26 17:19:16,wallstreetbets,"How high do you think AMC will go? I'm holding AMC for about 3 weeks now and if it's going to reach the 20's I might sell. I haven't done any much research so I really don't know, I just kind of want to walk away with my profits. However, if you guys recommend holding and potentially pushing the price past 20 dollars, I'm in.  
So.... what do you guys think. How high can AMC go?"

2021-05-26 18:59:41,wallstreetbets,"For anyone that's interested, like me being a software engineer, what Blackberry and AWS partnered on with Ivy is running machine learning models on the data from electric car sensors

So Ivy estimates the 'what' a car's sensor is outputting

They're classifying sensor outputs since manufacturers can't give full documentation on everything in a format that is digestible since there's no standards in place

Right now if you wanted to do analysis on EVs you have to aggregate data from Tesla, then figure out how for Mercedes et al; but Ivy will do this step for you using machine learning"
2021-05-26 18:18:09,wallstreetbets,No I need more time to accumulate before people figure it out.
2021-05-26 19:11:37,wallstreetbets,See BB DD. UPVOTE!
2021-05-26 16:53:53,wallstreetbets,I keep thinking it’s an acquisition target for one of the big boys with more cash than they know what to do with.
2021-05-26 17:10:03,wallstreetbets,The initial target price was 10-15 bb was hot and obviously undervalued when it was a 5$ stock
2021-05-26 16:25:37,wallstreetbets,I’m in at $20. Pleas BB.
2021-05-26 17:03:48,wallstreetbets,The narrative behind BB stock is quite technical and multi-faceted for individual investors...and probably most analysts
2021-05-26 18:46:04,wallstreetbets,"10k at around $10.50. Still red, still don't give a fuck. 💎🍆"

2021-05-26 18:57:21,wallstreetbets,I have BB stock. Bought in at January-February with all the other meme stocks. Still in the red. Not selling. I'd like to see some Ue4 combined with QNX for self driving car fun/training.
2021-05-26 17:05:02,wallstreetbets,In at $15….I dream of breaking even.
2021-05-26 16:52:38,wallstreetbets,LETS FUCKING GO! I'M IN ALREADY!
2021-05-26 17:01:44,wallstreetbets,$BB is the very definition of deep fucking value especially in an ever expanding tech world
2021-05-26 18:02:50,wallstreetbets,Why is it suddenly up 10%? Im surprised after seeing it in the red for months.
2021-05-26 17:31:47,wallstreetbets,You guys need to convince the analysts.
2021-05-26 19:44:24,wallstreetbets,I worked at $BB. In 2012. My first job. Back when it was called RIM. One thing hasn’t changed since then. All analysts still think it is shit because their phones suck. I haven’t done enough research to figure out how Deep its FV is but the fact they’re still around tells me that Daddy Chen knows what he’s doing. You sob I’m in. Buying shares at open.

2021-05-26 18:45:17,wallstreetbets,Revenue is the key here. They have a bunch of products but at the end of the day being able to sell them is what matters. $700 million revenue with low growth  shouldn't be a $55 billion market cap. I'd say $15 if they show traction. $20 if Ivy looks like it is going to do well. If BB hits anywhere over $20 again I'll sell the bit I bought on the way down. It's a never ending cycle with me and this stock apparently. 4 years of buying and selling this thing.
2021-05-26 17:05:24,wallstreetbets,Especially with that colonial pipeline shit
2021-05-26 18:32:00,wallstreetbets,I've been refreshing reddit all day during it's run and until the last few hours there hadn't been any posts. I was expecting to see an answer to your question but haven't found it.
2021-05-26 18:22:38,wallstreetbets,How are the premiuns?

2021-05-26 18:44:21,wallstreetbets,No posts about a specific meme stock tends to turn into increases in value?
2021-05-26 18:32:49,wallstreetbets,"It has 1.5 years of time, so Theta is not a large portion of the price. It still moves quickly with price changes. And again. You don't have to be right about timing whereas with weekly or monthlies you lose everything if you are barely off."

2021-05-26 16:37:00,wallstreetbets,I'll give it a read.
2021-05-26 19:49:18,wallstreetbets,"My thought was it’s following in the wake of the big 2 short squeezers. Not that I think BB is a squeeze play,per say, just that the last run up of BB was at the first of this year."
2021-05-26 18:35:15,wallstreetbets,That's actually not that bad and a market cap of around what 20-30 billion seems legit.
2021-05-26 18:36:28,wallstreetbets,"I probably won't hold till expiration, I'd assume to sell within a year before theta is more of a factor"

2021-05-26 17:35:48,wallstreetbets,May I ask why you like the stock? Seems like it benefited a lot from covid and people staying at home and gaming. But I wonder if the future sales will still be as strong. I’m seeking value plays and I know I am on the wrong sub.

2021-05-26 19:01:36,wallstreetbets,"The script to Bill's monologue:

""“I know how dark it is for you right now; curled up, lying in your own emotional vomit. You're in hell now, Boomhauer. And the only way out is through a long, dark tunnel. And you're afraid to go in, because there's a train comin' at you, carryin' a boxcar full of heartbreak. Well, let me tell you something: all you can do is let it hit you. And then try to find your legs. I know, I've taken that hit more times than I can remember. Look at me Boomhauer, I'm fat, and I'm old, and every day I'm just gonna wake up fatter and older. Yet somehow I manage to drag this fat old bald bastard into the alley every day. I'm out there diggin' holes, fallin' into them, climbin' out, tryin' again, and tomorrow, I'm gonna hang outside at a ladies prison. And the first thing those lady cons are gonna see after 20 years? Is me. Will I get one? Experience says no. Will I be out there next month? If I'm alive you better believe it. You gotta get right back up on that tanning bed, slip into a tight t-shirt, wash off some of that cologne, and get yourself out of that tunnel and into some strange woman's bed!”"

I am currently at $6200 by some miracle thanks to SPY calls and F after being as low as $3500 and as high as $8,000.

If I had just put the whole $6,000 into SPY on Feb 25th I would be at $6,500 and have about 200 hours of my life back from staring at price charts.

I feel like I'm probably just lucky to still have my money, but I actually understand options and the greeks now. Do I stay on the rollercoaster with 3 months of training or just realize it is all a casino, dump it into SPY and do something that actually makes life better for someone?

2021-05-26 19:52:06,wallstreetbets,"It’s Dec. 31, 2022. The great squeezes, or The Hedge-pocalypse as historians would later call it, have all played out. The upheaval of the past years has been great. All markets have been merged into one mega market called The Stonk Market. Shares are now called “tendies”. Floor traders are now shouting “give me 500 tendies of Apple!”. All brokers are called either “autists” or “tards” based on their success. The title of hedge fund manager is now passé. The title of Grand Tard Wrangler is now used exclusively. 

There is a new breed of wealthy person in the world. Country clubs have renovated their golfing lands into paintball grounds and go-kart tracks. Country clubs are no longer seen as being prestigious by their history or clientele but by how good the tendies they serve are and which one has the most bad ass water slide. 

Birth rates skyrocket as 9’s and 10’s suddenly realize how attracted they are to that person working at Wendy’s with a brokerage app and a wild ass YOLO in their heart. 

All ape poaching has come to a screeching halt as protection rangers are now all equipped with what can only be described as “an Ironman style gorilla suit”. 

Cathie Wood has completely lost her mind and now runs a public access show where she throws chicken bones and channels dead people to make stonk predictions. 

And this was all possible because you didn’t get bitch hands when you finally went green again during the squeeze. 

And PLTR is still a trash stock hovering around $18."

If you buy at $100 and buy back in at $90, you're still on the hook for your original realized gains.

Example;

Originally bought at $80. Sold at $100. $20 realized gains. Bought in at $90, $10 left in cash... Still $20 realized gains for the year.

If the stock goes back down to $70, and you sell at a loss, it cancels out, of course."

2021-05-26 17:24:13,wallstreetbets,The market is stuck at major resistance that it can’t break.  it’s mainly retail doing the buying right now. Most good news has very little affect on the market. There would have to be some major big news to get whales back to buying (which is not impossible). If they agree on some bipartisan infrastructure plan that could be the catalyst to make the s&p move to 4300 which is why I think Biden is going to give a speech on it soon. I don’t know for sure it will happen when I say so don’t make bets of my advice because when it comes there will be plenty of time to join in. Every big holiday has created big movements upwards just with the combination of bad going on in the market I’m betting this is the one where we change course. I’m am also hedged to be wrong so keep that in mind as well

2021-05-26 15:54:26,wallstreetbets,Busy day at work... couldn’t check it all day. I do stupid stuff.
2021-05-26 16:02:33,wallstreetbets,Because I gave up on$GE I was thinking it would break out for a while and just forgot about my RH account where I do nothing but yolo.
2021-05-26 16:08:23,wallstreetbets,I closed out 30% the pos though. Do I put that in gains?
2021-05-26 18:46:28,wallstreetbets,Only if you go into blind yolos. Give me 80% of the profit.
2021-05-26 16:17:46,wallstreetbets,if it's big enough yeah
2021-05-26 17:30:02,wallstreetbets,That’s what she said...
2021-05-26 17:16:49,wallstreetbets,"CEO Doug Ingram is not universally disliked. He is universally appreciated to be one of the best biotech CEO’s. Patient advocates and patients praise Sarepta. Two more Sarepta DMD drugs have received FDA approval since Exondys in 2016. SRPT has 40 potential drugs in it’s pipeline, from preclinical through Phase III trials. PPMO and gene micro dystrophin will be game changers for the industry."
2021-05-26 16:22:38,wallstreetbets,"I have a loose familiarity with this company from working in the industry and they seem also disliked by providers and payers due to the controversial FDA approval for Exondys. 

If the stock is going down after good data it may be because several other larger and more reputable pharma companies are putting out promising pipeline drugs for muscular dystrophy that will probably outperform Sarepta’s."
2021-05-26 17:50:32,wallstreetbets,So why the malaise in the stock price?  I agree with you which is why I can’t figure it out.
2021-05-26 15:48:18,wallstreetbets,Broke out of the wedge today. Let’s gooo
2021-05-26 15:51:59,wallstreetbets,"I'm in for 1300 shares and 40 6/18 $9 calls

Let's goooooo"
2021-05-26 17:41:56,wallstreetbets,"30,300 shares checking in. We’re going to $15 easy with this setup."
2021-05-26 16:40:50,wallstreetbets,This stock has been edging us for so long now please let me get some profit
2021-05-26 16:54:22,wallstreetbets,"Still holding 21,000 shares LFG"
2021-05-26 17:34:11,wallstreetbets,"I have 8000 shares. My personal plan is to wait untill this stock catches alot of momentum, and then start selling deep in the money far out leaps in 10 contract chunks. That way, i make close to what I would if I sold it, my shares are not put back I to the float, and I can collect dividends for the next couple years."
2021-05-26 16:02:19,wallstreetbets,"Executed options on Friday, just bought some of those dirt cheap 6/18 $9 calls. Good DD."
2021-05-26 18:41:15,wallstreetbets,"Baby ape here, 320 shares lol. This feels awfully similar to the last couple months leading up to the huge GME explosion of January. My paper hands sold GME in December and have regretted it so much. Not making that mistake again. I’m buckled up for the ride this time!"
2021-05-26 18:27:16,wallstreetbets,"UWMC broke and held $8.40 today, next stop $9.20 and the $10.00 on deck"
2021-05-26 16:22:20,wallstreetbets,3500 shares checking in
2021-05-26 17:23:54,wallstreetbets,Bought 5k shares strapped in for the long haul
2021-05-26 16:39:28,wallstreetbets,5k shares at 7.68 and 70 $11 calls at .18. Cant wait for my dividend
2021-05-26 15:44:51,wallstreetbets,"This should breakout soon. Also to add on, I believe msci inclusion is tomorrow and preliminary Russell inclusion list June 4th (they should get in this time)"
2021-05-26 17:44:54,wallstreetbets,Holding 4100 shares + some $8 6/18 CSPs which I sold when it was in the low $8s for some nice premium.
2021-05-26 18:13:58,wallstreetbets,Been in with shares and calls.. All this needs is more volume. Get the apes on it!!!
2021-05-26 18:42:24,wallstreetbets,I am with you guys!   680 @ 8.53. Saw green for the 1st time this afternoon.
2021-05-26 17:51:48,wallstreetbets,Couldn't have explained it better myself. See you on Mars brother 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-26 18:16:11,wallstreetbets,Tell a friend to tell a friend about uwmc
2021-05-26 15:40:49,wallstreetbets,Holding 10K shares.
2021-05-26 16:13:45,wallstreetbets,"The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May (according to the ortex update yesterday). Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready."
2021-05-26 16:23:51,wallstreetbets,only 4 calls but its something
2021-05-26 17:40:29,wallstreetbets,Just popped my options cherry and just purchased one. Yes one. Now do I just chill and wait to sell it before it expires? You wouldn’t be giving me financial advice since I already bought it. I’m just more comfortable with my 2.5k shares but thought this could be fun
2021-05-26 18:02:35,wallstreetbets,"Summon the apes, lets go boys . 🦍🦍🦍🦍"
2021-05-26 18:31:18,wallstreetbets,My 8c 7/16 x140 calls are patiently waiting to finally print!
2021-05-26 18:49:01,wallstreetbets,"200 Shares @ $7.85 and 2 6/18 $10 calls, which is about 25% of my portfolio

Edit: forgot cost basis"
2021-05-26 18:50:56,wallstreetbets,"This is really a no brainer. Stock price is still low, and you could argue fundamentally it should be higher. It’s a meme stonk, and if you’re caught holding any bags you still get a dividend."
2021-05-26 18:56:42,wallstreetbets,Hasn’t even hit non-squeeze price targets. Easy money.
2021-05-26 19:09:59,wallstreetbets,"First of all, the name of the post, let’s all take a second and give a round of applause. Now that’s out of the way, you will be rewarded with one moon.... enjoy the tendies my friends."
2021-05-26 19:06:23,wallstreetbets,UWMC holding strong! All in!
2021-05-26 19:42:30,wallstreetbets,"In for 24,300 shares @ 8.30 avg. Many tailwinds converging for the long play

2021-05-26 18:38:31,wallstreetbets,"Added to watch, if this prints the way AMC has been I will be well on my way to being the boyfriend again."
2021-05-26 18:53:57,wallstreetbets,"did you mention that the borrow rate is 54% lol [https://fintel.io/ss/us/uwmc](https://fintel.io/ss/us/uwmc)

edit: 48% for 5-27"
2021-05-26 15:37:20,wallstreetbets,I see triangles and lots of words so this must be solid dd
2021-05-26 16:41:12,wallstreetbets,"Best play ever. I yolo’D in  130k, will stay in after we jump."
2021-05-26 18:12:39,wallstreetbets,"LOL I felt kinda boss buying 60 shares and then I see all these posts ""I got 10k shares 8k here 5k there"" but hopefully someday I'll be there too with the big apes."
2021-05-26 15:38:16,wallstreetbets,Si
2021-05-26 19:06:11,wallstreetbets,"whoa - OI on calls is 30K for 9 strike and like .30 per contract... on the other hand perhaps shares???

wonder if I should divest from RKT bags (avg. $24 / down like 17K) and move all to UWMC - i say chances UWMC rips if it gets over 9 are far greater than RKT moving back up to $24 any time soon....

i shall be thinking of this tomorrow.... but will def get me some of them $9C's - YOLO!!!"
2021-05-26 19:16:45,wallstreetbets,I have been positioned here for a very long time waiting for the day to come for this to pop
2021-05-26 19:55:52,wallstreetbets,"I have 737 @ $8.08. No options,  bc I'm not quite ready to jump on that train.... I spent the last 3 weeks wishing I had more cash on hand to buy more. Can't wait for it to moon!!!"
2021-05-26 16:09:40,wallstreetbets,"I'm in, could also be a great place for allocating AMC / GME gains."
2021-05-26 16:29:37,wallstreetbets,"Been margin trading Bitcorn on Webull this last week and making bank, adding thousands to my UWMC position after each close, I'm up to 18,000 shares now. Average $7.614. Also have 30 9/21 $9c and 75 11/21 $12c, but they've been bleeding bigtime, doubt the options are going to print unless we have a big spike."
2021-05-26 18:39:53,wallstreetbets,"This is going to be one of those things where a big squeeze happens and the whole sub will be like ""why wasn't anyone talking about this?"" 

Get in before it launches so you don't have to be one of those people."
2021-05-26 19:02:49,wallstreetbets,Been in this one big for about a week now. Burn them all on the way up. Chart is looking like a beaut based on my TA! LFG!!
2021-05-26 19:39:07,wallstreetbets,"Holding 5,304 shares with 7.70 average, have bought 20 times since March. I’m obsessed."
2021-05-26 16:23:05,wallstreetbets,Momentum should keep building until ex-dividend date June 9th. All it needs is a little more volume and the index inclusions should definitely help on the buying side and pressure on shorts.
2021-05-26 15:56:36,wallstreetbets,Wake me at 30
2021-05-26 16:08:30,wallstreetbets,"I have averaged down to 8.20 over these last abysmal weeks and I couldn’t be happier. Also just bought some more of those dirt cheap 9 calls today. 

UWMC will rise from the rubble and take off to space just like virgin this weekend 😂"
2021-05-26 19:58:45,wallstreetbets,"Holding 50 shares averaging $7.68, can't wait for tendies and strippers!"
2021-05-26 19:58:26,wallstreetbets,4400 @ 10.64 come save me fellow apes. Bought a large chunk above 11.30 last time it jumped pre market been averaging down since.
2021-05-26 15:37:08,wallstreetbets,"dude, see what's happening AMC or GME these days? guess all apes are on those two stocks right now.

And some of them might watch us from MOON atm........."
2021-05-26 15:41:04,wallstreetbets,"long wall of text, i will give support like"
2021-05-26 15:42:48,wallstreetbets,"Positive movement on stock, just not sure how much ammo everyone has available these days"
2021-05-26 17:51:15,wallstreetbets,"6% of this company is public, none of you have or will listen but you are never going to make big money on this stock. you just arent."
2021-05-26 16:06:24,wallstreetbets,RKT instead for the memes
2021-05-26 17:49:27,wallstreetbets,Snagged some of those as well. Surprisingly cheap for being so close to the money
2021-05-26 19:21:10,wallstreetbets,"I thought I was the only one. I did the same, sold 250 GME shares in December.  Doubled my money there but the almost 4k return would have been more like $114,000 ish had I only waited about a month longer. Live and learn, don't make the same mistake twice.

I'm now the proud owner of 800 UWMC shares here and much stronger hands now after smacking myself in the in the head 111,000 times for each of those GME dollars I lost out on. Not selling this one until all shorts are squeezed out."
2021-05-26 18:37:45,wallstreetbets,Or we skip it all and go straight to $15
2021-05-26 16:33:50,wallstreetbets,where is the russell inclusion talk coming from? I looked on there website and didn't see anything
2021-05-26 18:35:25,wallstreetbets,I did she bought 500 shares in the low 8 range
2021-05-26 19:02:08,wallstreetbets,Just here with 1.1k but it’s something 🤑 dividends is gonna be cute too
2021-05-26 16:18:19,wallstreetbets,Holding 2k. I like the current momentum.
2021-05-26 16:19:42,wallstreetbets,you my friend are more than an APE now UWMC makes you a gorilla - you need your own post.
2021-05-26 16:26:53,wallstreetbets,Same here.
2021-05-26 16:16:07,wallstreetbets,Said beautifully adding this to the post
2021-05-26 18:09:39,wallstreetbets,"I misread and read that you doubled up to 18.5 million shares 🤣🤣 I was like dammmnnnn we have a whale on our side .

Let’s go UWMC 🍷🥃"
2021-05-26 17:48:14,wallstreetbets,"A nice cheap option to get you started. Normally people just sell their call back to the market when it reaches their target before it expires for some quick cash. If the stock moves up violently you get the benefit of selling your contract for a truck load of tendies when it only cost you a few bucks to buy a contract worth 100 shares. I have no idea what strike price, expiration, and premium your contract is though."
2021-05-26 19:00:23,wallstreetbets,For real talk about the moon we barely getting off the ground rn.... much room to go
2021-05-26 18:39:58,wallstreetbets,Not a chance money is not the reason your wife has a boyfriend sorry brother
2021-05-26 17:09:45,wallstreetbets,$AMC ape here leveraged to the tits. Fully intend on dumping earnings into UWMC when this thing lands.
2021-05-26 16:42:47,wallstreetbets,My thoughts exactly!
2021-05-26 17:51:00,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I saw green on GME today for the first time ever (EVER!), I love UWMC but I am diamond handing the FUCK outta my GME."
2021-05-26 19:38:22,wallstreetbets,Will take AMC tendies and add to my 600 shares of UWMC. This is the way!
2021-05-26 19:16:49,wallstreetbets,So true!
2021-05-26 19:42:14,wallstreetbets,It’s a healthy addiction don’t worry
2021-05-26 19:50:23,wallstreetbets,Only my checking account is worried; because it has been depleted. If I could buy more I would buy more!
2021-05-26 19:10:55,wallstreetbets,Could be a quick nap....
2021-05-26 18:36:54,wallstreetbets,Ok everyone let's play guess the age of this account
2021-05-26 16:10:45,wallstreetbets,Took my average down from high 9's to low 7's with some big buys at the laughable prices (sub 7) :)
2021-05-26 19:28:16,wallstreetbets,For what expiry? May look to get in some cheap 9c as well
2021-05-26 18:37:38,wallstreetbets,Without looking guess the age of this account
2021-05-26 16:04:44,wallstreetbets,"Lots, sell amc at 20 and dump into UWMC!  This is the way!"
2021-05-26 17:59:17,wallstreetbets,Low float good... not bad.... do you know how the market price is determined? They can’t sell their shares Atleast without announcing it first
2021-05-26 19:13:46,wallstreetbets,Interesting point. What kinds of returns would be reasonable to expect?
2021-05-26 18:36:51,wallstreetbets,RKT instead if you want to baghold
2021-05-26 19:22:52,wallstreetbets,Live and learn. Hopefully this is a chance for redemption. See you on Jupiter.
2021-05-26 19:16:12,wallstreetbets,This is the way...
2021-05-26 16:35:25,wallstreetbets,Russell releases prelim inclusion list on June 4th and final inclusion list on June 18th I believe. So it’s not a definitive there getting in but they were held out last quarter over float related issues and that was cleared up. So I’m making the assumption they get in this time
2021-05-26 18:37:44,wallstreetbets,Good job woodpecker
2021-05-26 16:33:33,wallstreetbets,"I have 8500, have posted"
2021-05-26 16:24:16,wallstreetbets,Right on! One of my favorite plays in the market right now.
2021-05-26 19:06:08,wallstreetbets,Wish I had that kind of a position haha
2021-05-26 18:33:31,wallstreetbets,Exp. 6/18. I think it was .35 for premium. Even if I don’t make much worry case I’m out of $35
2021-05-26 16:13:05,wallstreetbets,"It literally makes me laugh out loud thinking about watching it dip down to mid 6. It was so ludacris...like move bitch get out the way, ludacris (just to be clear)"
2021-05-26 17:49:33,wallstreetbets,"I thought it was over a SPAC related issue, not a float related issue."
2021-05-26 18:53:53,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a $9 call.  Assuming the price is above the strike and you want to exercise the contract make sure you have $900 in your account to purchase those shares, otherwise sell it before 6/18 to take a profit."
2021-05-26 17:38:12,wallstreetbets,My largest buys were in the 6s and I started buying at 10.29. in two accounts I own at a cost basis of 7.49 and 8.27. Been ready for this 🚀
2021-05-26 17:43:46,wallstreetbets,Uwmc is the rocket and Daddy Mat is the rocket man!
2021-05-26 19:14:51,wallstreetbets,"Yea seriously, we are fixin to “roll out”....
*looks left and right for add on laughs*"
2021-05-26 18:17:32,wallstreetbets,"Word was that it was a voting power related issue, here is a thread on it. Sounded like it was Russell thought Mat had 99% voting rights which Russell wants more available but UWM limits any one holder so Mat in theory doesn't have as much voting power as maybe Russell thought. I think UWM came out and said they were talking with Russell at one point about contesting their exclusion which is why people are hopeful they got it sorted out.

[UWM shareholders thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMCShareholders/comments/m9hy8u/russell_index_mistake_in_rejecting_uwmc_inclusion/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)"
2021-05-26 19:07:52,wallstreetbets,"It was the SPAC issue I believe, My man Russel was wilding out and dropped the mic on the wrong date."
2021-05-26 15:30:27,wallstreetbets,Are you telling me this company has zero debt and only cash flow in?!
2021-05-26 15:38:28,wallstreetbets,Buy your June and July calls while they are still cheap.
2021-05-26 16:59:41,wallstreetbets,I love this stock. 25.5% up so far and planning to keep holding till at least 7usd
2021-05-26 16:18:25,wallstreetbets,"Got in on leaps , feeling good"
2021-05-26 16:27:50,wallstreetbets,"Long 7.5k shares, Some July 4.5 calls, even more in the 1/22/21 Calls. This stock has a lot to be excited for."
2021-05-26 18:37:01,wallstreetbets,"Bought June calls last week, feeling good for now"
2021-05-26 19:10:55,wallstreetbets,We will hit $5 a share once the buyer deals are announced 🚀

2021-05-26 17:14:26,wallstreetbets,I shall make money on some calls and dump it into tell because hot damn I have eaten enough ramen.

2021-05-26 18:51:54,wallstreetbets,"KMI is a good company with many assets.  I believe short to medium term the will see good growth with rising prices from a reopening world, returning to travel and possible disruptions to the global supply in the Mideast.   BUT, I believe the long term, global trend of going electric and reducing dependence on fossil fuels will be a challenge I don’t think they’ll be able to easily overcome.  Unless they start leasing their acreage for wind or solar use, they’ll have problems down the road.   But, what the hell do I know?  Closed my position at 16.65."

I’ll say that there will be some huge announcements within the next 4 weeks including that we have actually “spoken” with them, they have been amongst us since the mid 60’s and they’re here from the future so they know the mistakes we’ve made as a species and that within 6 years life as we now know it won’t exist.  Before you say I’m a kook, etc. I’ve always believed in UFO’s etc. (there have been too many valid sightings) the US gov’t has millions of documents that only our Presidents have had access to and Pres Trump signed into law that it all must be public by late June 2021."

For a species to possess faster than light travel, it stands to reason they’ve already possessed technologies like Dyson Sphere powered planet sized hivemind super computers. They would operate on an intelligence level that makes us seem like single celled organisms. They’re not just gonna be chilling in random small space ships seeing the sights and avoiding detection. They would have no need for one. And for two they would have invisibility (bending light) at that level of advancement.

2021-05-26 15:27:13,wallstreetbets,"They *might * exist. They *probably* exist. But to say they absolutely do is far more disingenuous and arrogant.

It is entirely possible that life is extremely rare or has needed the exact amount of time that has elapsed in order to reach the levels that we are. It is also possible that intelligent species don't make it past certain barriers needed for universal colonization.

It is also entirely possible that life is extremely likely and that intelligent life may be the natural course for life on every planet. It may also be possible that universe's scale and distances are so vast that this essentially doesn't matter, as most civilisations may never encounter other intelligent life.

Our life is the only evidence for intelligent life in the universe. It is a fallacy to assume with absolutes that is an indication of what is going on in the rest of the universe."

Also crayola is missing out on a huge demographic by not making their product vegan, so we got that going for us.

2021-05-26 16:32:03,wallstreetbets,"A while back I saw a piece on [Investorplace. com](https://Investorplace.com) about GME and a battle of wills.  
I laughed then and laugh now at their concluding sentence.  I don't think whomever wrote the piece truly understands what's going on in this battle.  Or who is actually involved.  


\*\*\*  
If that's the case, GME comes down to who blinks first. With all due respect to WallStreetBets, it might be them."
2021-05-26 15:42:54,wallstreetbets,But how much have they made? And how much have GME longs lost this year?

2021-05-26 19:00:55,wallstreetbets,"Curious how much have they made? 

A ton of shorts shorted at the top in January. If you shorted at 400 and closed when it went back to $150 you did well."
2021-05-26 16:33:29,wallstreetbets,"| Around 958,000 shares of GameStop, worth $201 million, were bought to cover short sales over the last week, S3 data showed. Roughly 11.55 million shares of GameStop, or 20.3% of its float, are currently sold short, Dusaniwsky said."

2021-05-26 18:22:25,wallstreetbets,"Over 6.5 billion... so far!

But of course they covered in Jan! We m know they covered. There is no issue at all, with all this volume they totally covered! 

I mean, yes, they did short it for seven years straight and it was maxed out to the legal reporting limit of 140% over the last year, but of course they wouldn't have broken the law and overshorted, that's nonsense! 

And with the volume, they easily covered. I know no one sold and most people bought more, and rough calculations come up with insane numbers of 1000% to 3000% SI but guys, they totally covered!!!"
2021-05-26 19:07:51,wallstreetbets,"Fuck 'em, I hope they lose 60 billion."

2021-05-26 19:06:11,wallstreetbets,Y’all so gullible 😂😂😂
2021-05-26 16:33:27,wallstreetbets,So are Gamestop releasing earnings tomorrow? I know they are on June 8th but for some reason a good friend of mine thinks they are releasing an earnings report tomorrow.

2021-05-26 19:00:52,wallstreetbets,"Legit question: Where did that 6.5 billion go? Is is just from people buying dips and now holding stock that is worth more? Or is it interest they had to pay to...someone? on something something?  I don't know how this works.

Edit: From the article it mentions that the short-sellers were forced to buy stock to cover their short sells... so I think that makes sense? Maybe?"

2021-05-26 19:36:08,wallstreetbets,"This is what they've lost on GameStop... In all likelihood, Melvin had shorted numerous other stocks (AMC, KOSS, etc). Also, Melvin had huge put positions on the stocks they shorted. This article is ignoring the money puts lost, only the shares sold short.

Remember when in Feb Melvin was bragging about the money they recovered? That despite losing 50% of their net worth in Jan, they had made 20% in February. Days before gme shot to the moon (again). This is because their puts started being valuable again since it looked like GME was going back to the $20-$10, they might've even bought puts at the top which eventually became worthless."

2021-05-26 16:48:25,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it, I say cut them out of so much money that it (to a subtle extent) destabilizes the global economy, causing moderate inflation, and we become rich without cashing out our tendies because we won't lose all our worth shorting some of the greatest stocks of all time like bozos."
2021-05-26 18:39:16,wallstreetbets,Dtcc apparently has a $72 trillion insurance policy. I'm not stopping until it's exhausted.

I'm a small guy holding XX at a decent buy in. If anybody buys in now, just know the associated risk. I did this to, first and foremost, say FUCK YOU to the people that have fucked us for a long time. If I lose my money, I don't really care as long as they lose more....they have lost hundreds of millions. I might lose $2,800. Lol. 

Edit to add: I'm up almost triple my investment. I could have timed it better and been up six times over, but whatever. Watching these fucks hemorrhage money is worth the money I put in.

2021-05-26 18:47:17,wallstreetbets,"please explain then. right from their website here it is (old numbers from 2017)

DTCC's subsidiary, The Depository Trust Company (DTC), established in 1973, was created to reduce costs and provide clearing and settlement efficiencies by immobilizing securities and making ""book-entry"" changes to ownership of the securities.
DTC brings efficiency to the securities industry by retaining custody of more than 1.3 million active securities issues valued at US$54.2 trillion as of 7/31/2017, including securities issued in the US and more than 131 countries and territories.


so 54 trillions in 2017 and Ive read its now around 62 trillions."

2021-05-26 18:48:41,wallstreetbets,"Are you under the impression that assets deposited into the DTCC are then owned by the DTCC? It seems you are, but that’s absolutely not how it works.

They’re owned by the participants. A mechanism exists for withdrawal: https://www.dtcc.com/settlement-and-asset-services/securities-processing/withdrawals-service"

2021-05-26 18:50:57,wallstreetbets,thanks for the clarification.
2021-05-26 18:58:09,wallstreetbets,Mom
2021-05-26 18:53:36,wallstreetbets,"No problem. If you want to dig a bit, the DTCC has owned assets in the terms of hundreds of millions I believe, reflected on their balance sheet. 

There is a theory that if a hedge fund defaults basically all of the DTCC will be liquidated to bail out GME holders. I find that theory preposterous for dozens of reasons, including the fact that participants can withdraw, the government won’t let our market explode to save GME holders, and the Fed won’t turn the US dollar into Zimbabwean money to save GME holders."
2021-05-26 19:01:10,wallstreetbets,My understanding is that there will be a margin call or many margins calls. HFs go bankrupt. they get liquidated. banks and insurances companies will cover part of it. DTCC will cover part of it. The FED reserve might need to intervene too. to what extent each is responsible? that I dont know.

2021-05-26 19:03:09,wallstreetbets,"I got in because of the gme stuff earlier this year. Luckily I got in fairly low and averaged down to .90/c a share. 

The company definitely has plays in the works to make it a good long term investment. They have been acquiring brands and storefronts as well as improving quality. Legalization a need to pass for them to work their way down here, once that happens it'll be worth some money.

A little research on the company might be a good idea to see what he means."
2021-05-26 16:15:05,wallstreetbets,Lol.  I’m up a little now but I’m reading all kinds of sites and now I want to keep holding.   I’ll never learn lol

2021-05-26 15:14:38,wallstreetbets,Really only a few people in Europe will buy a chinese EV. We dont like China here very much. At least mostly amongst the people that have the means to buy an EV. It just does not have grounds. We will wait for Germans to make EVs then we buy those.
2021-05-26 19:36:23,wallstreetbets,"NIO actually has high quality and technology with their cars. From what I've researched it seems like NIO is actually ahead of the game in terms of EV tech compared to the traditional car manufacturers. 

NIO is also close to recording a profit and will probably record a profit this year despite the chip shortage. Their YOY sales have been rising astronomically, their production has been increasing and they're slowly improving their supply chain/production. It's extremely hard to make EV cars and the fact they're producing quality EV and are close to making a profit is a good sign. Just look at some of the gimmick EV companies like Lordstown, Lucid Motors, etc, who aren't even on track to producing cars. 

Even if they struggle in Europe they're on track on becoming a major player in China and possibly other Asian markets. I'm personally bullish on them but I understand why people will be scared away such as the fact that NIO is very reliant on the Chinese government and facilities for production."
2021-05-26 15:30:22,wallstreetbets,NIO GANG.
2021-05-26 15:17:20,wallstreetbets,joder is de fucking rey NIO
2021-05-26 16:26:57,wallstreetbets,"This post is surely american, lol.

In Europe we are not interested about NIO or XPENG. We have good quality cars coming from Germany and several other providers as well, we are proud to have, imho, better versions, cheaper as well. NIO will not thrive in Europe."
2021-05-26 14:22:46,wallstreetbets,How many Chinese Car companies are in Europe?

2021-05-26 16:07:03,wallstreetbets,Look at his profile. He probably works at NIO
2021-05-26 14:22:38,wallstreetbets,I agree good stocks got sold off but NIO is a game changer at $40 this will rise higher
2021-05-26 16:02:15,wallstreetbets,"It was at 60 not that long ago too.

why didnt I sell at that point :/"
2021-05-26 17:10:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I really don’t see a bunch of Europeans going out to buy these. If anything it would be the Chinese living in Europe."
2021-05-26 16:24:52,wallstreetbets,"On top of that - there are lots of local (national) car manufacturers around Europe. It's not just Germans, it's Czechs, French, Spaniards, Italians, Romanians...all making cars in low price ranges. Most are/have been transforming to EV already. China (NIO) can compete only with price and they have to go down with it a lot to make up for terrible reputation of chinese products - but national (smaller) car manufacturers will be here to pick up this market of people who cannot afford Tesla. And they don't have reputation problems, being ""EU products."" Owning a chinese car you'd be a laughing stock in most of EU - people be like ""dude Y tho iits chinese crap, will break down in a year."" Short sighed, maybe, but such is an atmosphere here and that's why I think NIO's expansion to Europe will not bear the fruits it's bull investor might think it will."
2021-05-26 18:27:52,wallstreetbets,"100% agree with that. Germans are known for car‘s since years, we don‘t buy chinese car‘s in europe and we won’t start with it now. Not even the poor people would buy a chinese car, check out balkan region. Everybody driving mercedes...."

2021-05-26 15:08:56,wallstreetbets,Place the ticker on your DD bro
2021-05-26 14:47:09,wallstreetbets,"Invite you to r/uraniumsqueeze. There's lots of solid DD over there about various uranium companies in different supply levels (exploration, mining, production). Some favorites on the sub that are focused in North America for larger growth potential are

- Energy Fuels (UUUU, EFR.TO)
- Denison mines (DNN, DML.TO)
- NexGen (NXE)
- Cameco (CCO, CCJ)
- UEX / FCU

There is various others as well, especially those in other countries (Deep Yellow, Bannerman, Kazatomprom). 

Another thing that's good for the uranium thesis is Sprott uranium participation trust developing this summer. Long story short once it is formed in the summer they're going to be using funds to physically buy uranium off the market which will further lead to increase supply squeezes which can hopefully get spot prices up and start having these uranium companies kick up contracts."
2021-05-26 14:41:32,wallstreetbets,"They have a uranium licence, which is a pain in the arse to acquire and gives then access to US uranium deposits"
2021-05-26 16:16:08,wallstreetbets,"I like it mostly because of their easy transition into REE. I believe in the coming year or two they can challenge MP with again is a $5B market cap - they are not just a uranium company. In addition, they have an awesome balance sheet and small market cap making them poised to have their efforts reflected in the stock price."
2021-05-26 13:58:27,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks. My confirmation bias agrees with you
2021-05-26 13:59:08,wallstreetbets,"I’m down w my homie Elon, but I think you’re making some sweeping assumptions. 

1: China bans all mining.
2: All mining actually stops if there is a ban. 

I don’t see #1 happening, but if it does, I certainly don’t see #2 happening. 

Sure, China could track down miners based on energy consumption. But would they? Or is their position a PR statement more than a financial policy? 

Finally, if both #1 and #2 happen, why do these two companies benefit against all the others, current and future? Is there a Moat I’m unaware of?"

2021-05-26 14:19:52,wallstreetbets,Understood.  Thanks for the info.  TD Ameritrade showed it as 101% as of 4/30/2021.  So i can assume the heavily shorted percentage has decreased drastically since 4/30? Or am i understanding that 101% completely wrong?  Thanks in advance
2021-05-26 14:28:25,wallstreetbets,I’m in now 600 shares deep. I like it to go back to 15
2021-05-26 14:30:33,wallstreetbets,"Great question!! I invested as a long term growth stock and have been buying to lower my average since it was around 11$.  I’m not gonna lie and say i didn’t have a “ holy shit” moment when i saw that 100+ short interest.  Definitely part of my post is to learn more research options for short interest.  Love to hear everyone’s thoughts on it.  If research is correct, their market cap and current cash holdings are roughly the same which SEEMS like safe bet to me??"
2021-05-26 14:24:26,wallstreetbets,"This data comes with a delay and based on the price action Highly doubt the short interest was that high and it decreased. I don't see how they got to that number buy maybe is the short interest on their platform (shorts are 101% of the trades with respect to longs) although this is far-fetched. I don't know where that number is from but finviz basically says short interest is 12% which is way higher than Finra so I don't really know which one is right. 
I hope you are right because I-am long NNDM for a long time (I wrote an article on them if you are interested why I am long)"

I suspect investors will get impatient with the performance, as it wont meet their expectations. Just my take, may be wrong, I probably am, may you get tendies."

2021-05-26 19:46:31,wallstreetbets,Over priced ? From being completely shut down ? Yeah I don't think so. Airlines are way more popular than cruises
2021-05-26 13:53:51,wallstreetbets,Unemployment is scheduled to sunset in September I believe.    My feelings are in align with your timeframe that this fall there will be a dip.    Number 1 rule of the casino is no when to hit and when to split.     Summer of love is still on.
2021-05-26 19:09:40,wallstreetbets,"Well some states will see a worse dip because they're cutting it off earlier. Something to keep an eye out for. Especially Florida where the tourist season is over until October/Nov yet they turned down the benefits starting in late June. Which makes no sense but hey, that's their politics. /shrug."

Short sellers out completely out of ""reasons"" while gamestop keeps giving long holders more reasons to hold."

2021-05-26 18:20:09,wallstreetbets,">Cool but trying to understand how this works, is it a case of hold forever or an agreed price here, obviously everyone is different but

The consensus on this forum is the hedges have shorted more shares than actually exist(naked shorts). Therefore they cannot return the shares because they don't exist. When we continue to hold they will get margin called and cause an infinity (forever) squeeze. Price will raise until all shorts are satisfied. Ape hold banana until banana make ape happy. Are you happy?"

I mean i am thinking about selling gme with profit and buy more on dip, or maybe amc? Dont know yet, confused ape there"

2021-05-26 13:28:31,wallstreetbets,"Good luck. The guy who shorted the housing market in 2008 (Michael Burry) bought $530 Million of puts on Tesla. 

I'm assuming he bought in around February although the 13F filings were released earlier this month. I thought WSB would be bearish on TSLA after that. Haven't been on here much lately though.

UPDATE:

The position Burry opened has a notional value of $530M not a market value. This mean he is controlling 800,100 shares that were valued at around $667/share when the position was either opened or reported (March 31, 2021)

I'm sorry for the misinformation, guys. Here's the source:

by that same lemming logic, you’d take to the Hwang naturally"
2021-05-26 13:59:17,wallstreetbets,good luck bro
2021-05-26 14:17:43,wallstreetbets,"13F filings reveal 8001 put contracts purchased for ~$534M. 

SCION is up 40% on the position.

So each put contract is about $927(x100)

(1.4*530,000,00)/8001 = ~927

This means he likely is in the 1500 strike put contracts for 1-2 years out (LEAPs).

I'm not really sure what I'm missing. 

You said read an inch deeper but didn't say what I was wrong about. Just am curious.

UPDATE:

I was wrong. The position Burry opened represents a notional value of $534 Million, which would mean he controls 800,100 shares of Tesla via 8001 put contracts of an unknown strike & expiration."

Man...wtf happened to this sub."
2021-05-26 15:15:35,wallstreetbets,notional value is the value of the shares controlled by the contracts. Burry shorted when the stonk was at ~$670 according to those numbers.
2021-05-26 14:13:33,wallstreetbets,Got one 800c for fall. Perhaps this will be my true wsb admission ticket.
2021-05-26 17:00:43,wallstreetbets,"You're right. It's the notional value.

Since he's up 40% on the position I wonder what strikes he bought.

This means he may have opened the position in Q1 when TSLA was at $667/share.

2021-05-26 13:40:50,wallstreetbets,Not sure why they moved so much tbh. The supposed catalyst dropped yesterday (update for their programme it seems) but the chart barely moved yet today it shot up around 7% immediately on opening and now sitting near 12%. It's just weird???

2021-05-26 13:12:23,wallstreetbets,I would start low with 100 shares and then add on the dips. The company has 1.4 billion in cash and they are buying up their competitors. The stock is worth around $5.50 a share just in their cash holdings
2021-05-26 13:35:15,wallstreetbets,Aren’t they also a company in the defense sector?
2021-05-26 13:40:14,wallstreetbets,"The business is registered in Israel but like most Jews they are chilling in Sunrise, Florida."
2021-05-26 13:43:03,wallstreetbets,I believe it shot up because the stock has tanked so much. When I first bought in it was around $11 a share
2021-05-26 15:48:15,wallstreetbets,shorts are being squeezed.  Need to hop in now
2021-05-26 13:16:18,wallstreetbets,It is also HEAVILY shorted.  This could be an awesome squeeze
2021-05-26 13:41:35,wallstreetbets,They just 3D printed a circuit board that was tested on the last NASA launch. They have contracts with the DOD which is why I bought into the stock.
2021-05-26 13:43:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm pulling this from memory so if I'm off on something bear with me.

Nano is a 3D printer manufacturer whose main product is the dragonfly printer, which to be fair is awesome, but has a lackluster sales track. There was a couple of government contract but total sales was some absurd low amount that was announced very poorly on one of the calls. CEO did several direct offerings during the run up for the Cathie Wood hype that...doubled???.. the float. Not sure on that one. 

There was definitely something there at one point but I'm kinda nervous about it now. 

Positions enter $6.42
                    Exit $6.66

Couple of cc inbetween"
2021-05-26 13:44:52,wallstreetbets,"Ha, that got a chuckle.

Not as concerned with where the headquarters is located. Where are the plants?"
2021-05-26 13:47:20,wallstreetbets,I got in at around 14 thinking I got a steal. Been buying in every whole dollar drop since. Average cost 8 and some change
2021-05-26 13:49:05,wallstreetbets,Mainly in the United States but I believe they have some in Asia and obviously in Israel.
2021-05-26 13:49:38,wallstreetbets,Nice job!
2021-05-26 14:21:13,wallstreetbets,I hope they can keep this up for another 8 months and we all pay half the taxes for long term investments
2021-05-26 12:35:13,wallstreetbets,Definitely maybe not yes
2021-05-26 13:47:47,wallstreetbets,"A lot of Misinfo about voting here.  If you were holding shares on or before April 15 then you get to vote.  If you purchased them after that, you don’t.  If you sold your shares on April 16th then you still get to vote, you just don’t get those sweet tendies...

Edit: this info only applies to GME.  I have no idea about movie stock"
2021-05-26 16:26:40,wallstreetbets,If I sell this thing is going to 400 guaranteed
2021-05-26 16:49:46,wallstreetbets,"stonk goes up and stonk goes down

buy high, sell low

nothing new"
2021-05-26 13:03:48,wallstreetbets,This is why buying the dips is important.
2021-05-26 12:30:08,wallstreetbets,"I don't think they have the ability to drop it significantly anymore. Take a look at some of the recent reverse repo DD. The HFs are close to margin calls, the only thing preventing them are reverse repos and there are limits to those that are quickly approaching. They cannot control the price without capital."
2021-05-26 14:44:27,wallstreetbets,Who are “they”
2021-05-26 17:03:58,wallstreetbets,"With the new rules (OCC, NSCC) and vastly inflated margin requirements (800%+) I highly doubt they’re planning to do that nor do they have the capital for another giant attack."
2021-05-26 19:39:26,wallstreetbets,I'm just waiting for this massive short attack it's inevitable and then ama buy the hell out of the dip
2021-05-26 12:28:09,wallstreetbets,You think we’ll sell lmao
2021-05-26 14:48:19,wallstreetbets,If they think they are simulating a squeeze they are doing a really shitty job.
2021-05-26 18:08:22,wallstreetbets,"Let them, I have money cleared in my account just in case"
2021-05-26 18:56:55,wallstreetbets,"Many of us have funds set aside for an attack. I've seen fellow tards setting GTC limit buy orders to combat the potential HF bullshit.

Hell, if you wanted to preemptively strike, disable margin in broker account to recall the lent out shares."
2021-05-26 12:37:30,wallstreetbets,"Know what you own, and understand a shorts motive. They want shares out of retail by end of day Friday so they can’t vote and help with an accurate share count. Also, Friday is options expiration, so they will likely be pushing down hard. We are just watching the giants battle it out. We have done our part buying and continuing to buy, but mostly by holding. Apes are hoarding shares. And then there’s next week when shares are needed to cover Friday’s close. This weeks just fun. I think Thursday and Friday we will see our paper-handed cousins selling out for profit or panic, which in my mind clears the way for the 💎🤲"
2021-05-26 12:28:59,wallstreetbets,I can count to po-ta-toe.
2021-05-26 12:53:45,wallstreetbets,"Of course, there will always be dumps"
2021-05-26 19:05:42,wallstreetbets,"I bought puts for next week in the middle of today. So yes I think so. Also fucked over anyone who, for example, kept selling 210c each week. Now those theta gangers will lose their shares."
2021-05-26 12:31:33,wallstreetbets,"I thought about this but they are foolish to short a market that’s been supported by the fed.  Wait until the fed wind down their repo buying then look for a market top. 

Think a lot of smart money sell the top and buy the dip but they are mainly cash waiting for a correction as inflation data take bite."
2021-05-26 12:27:26,wallstreetbets,It’s hilarious how WSB now wants to talk about GME AND AMC go fuck yourselves
2021-05-26 16:01:29,wallstreetbets,Stock go brrrrrrr
2021-05-26 16:39:14,wallstreetbets,Who cares honestly. They’re fucked apes know it so we hold no matter what. They’ve shown how desperate they are and that only feeds into the confirmation bias.
2021-05-26 16:27:06,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know if this is smart. I’m not smart but here’s what I’m thinking. 
If the shareholders meeting is the 9th of June. 
They’re essentially simulating a squeeze in the next week. Then will drop the price prior to the shareholders meeting. 
Then our votes are counted, share data is released etc. and then people find out how fucked the American Stock system is. I don’t think the government will allow that to happen. This may be the start of the squeeze imo. 
Disclaimer I’m high most of the time and only have xx shares, so someone correct me if what I’m saying is irrelevant."
2021-05-26 14:11:57,wallstreetbets,250 C’s for this week have the most OI near the money gonna be one hell of a fight to push past it. Also please take a look at the 6 month chart. Gme has barely remained above 200 for more then a few weeks at all this year. Gme has to maintain these price levels to really make shorts bleed. There have been a bunch of bear traps this past month and this could easily be another bull trap. However i think if shorts do manage to push gme back down we will find a new floor above 160 hopefully above 200 then it will really get interesting
2021-05-26 13:23:30,wallstreetbets,From my cold diamond hands! To the moon!
2021-05-26 13:35:15,wallstreetbets,If they haven't won and you're selling because you think you're in the matrix then you sir have hands made of paper

2021-05-26 17:41:44,wallstreetbets,Nice try :)
2021-05-26 17:59:54,wallstreetbets,I'm counting on it being a ploy. Bought today. Will buy when they drop it.
2021-05-26 18:24:16,wallstreetbets,I mean I guess anything could be possible.
2021-05-26 18:25:39,wallstreetbets,"You are probably right. The big open interest on AMC this week is at $20, so the high frequency traders have been working against the price getting there."
2021-05-26 18:58:19,wallstreetbets,"20 mill in volume, drove it."
2021-05-26 19:25:05,wallstreetbets,"Did you see the shit coming from Reddit Detectives yesterday?

GME is incorporating ETH in some unimagined way. This isn’t even a moon squeeze anymore it’s a fucking galactic empire takeover

Edit: AMC definitely just coming along for the ride"
2021-05-26 19:39:51,wallstreetbets,"THEIR GOAL IS TO MAKE PEOPLE DAY TRADE AND SELL FRIDAY. If that happens then whatever shares you rebuy Friday does not get counted for JUNE 2 COUNT, which makes the amount of shares owned look LESS than it’s been!"
2021-05-26 19:55:05,wallstreetbets,Based on the charts I don't think so. I think someone big is loaded up and trying to make bank. Someone keeps buying large amounts when volume and price die down causing it to rise and it seems to be holding.
2021-05-26 12:27:11,wallstreetbets,Most likely what is happening why not.
2021-05-26 19:32:10,wallstreetbets,"Well Cramer just said short sellers are making a mistake. He's agreeing with WSB now... And as we know by the law of inverse cramertardation, GME is bound to plummet now."
2021-05-26 17:14:29,wallstreetbets,"This whole situation reeks of fraud and corruption. Seems there are more shares out there being sold than there are shares. 

Little guys will be crushed. The rich will pay a 3% fine on the profits of their crimes."

2021-05-26 15:41:22,wallstreetbets,"What do they gain from having people lose money? Even if half of apes sold right now, shorts would still need to cover eventually."
2021-05-26 12:41:10,wallstreetbets,"Bring it up so it can fall harder this time...   Let it climb a bit higher this time, (throw some cheap bananas at the apes) so they'll dump their shit...  Fall hard hard harder so hedge's can ""actually"" cover their shorts...   Who knows, just know I'm not buying more @ $342 again...📉  Loss porn waiting to happen..."
2021-05-26 14:42:06,wallstreetbets,"This is definitely a retail driven circle jerk. Shorts didn't cover when GME was $350 they are not going to cover now lol. And on AMC much of the short interest are hedges on puts where the premium has already been paid.

Make money while you can but keep a quick trigger on the ejector seat for when this shit goes sideways. It always does with these stocks and it usually happens quickly when you're not expecting it."
2021-05-26 12:47:26,wallstreetbets,Pseudo squeeze they will let it run up then crash the price so paper handed fools sell there shares and makef their vote null and void
2021-05-26 17:10:45,wallstreetbets,"Definitely, I mean as long as they can effectively control the supply by creating synthetic shares, why wouldn't they cover some portion to drive price up, sell calls, then short again to drive price down. They might realized they are screwed in the long run, but this would be a valid strategy to recoup some losses."
2021-05-26 19:59:50,wallstreetbets,The squeeze happened months ago. Now we just go up because it good stonk
2021-05-26 15:05:37,wallstreetbets,"They are planning on squeezing even higher then crash the entire market and blame it on the squeeze. It's so obvious what the market makers, hedge funds, maybe illuminati are doing."
2021-05-26 16:21:51,wallstreetbets,"I am SO SICK OF THIS ""they"". Nobody is plotting... People buying now will be caught with the bag as previous bagholders run away. Investing is not a team sport - watch out for your own money."

2021-05-26 19:58:00,wallstreetbets,technically the trade has to be settled on april 15 so you get to vote if you sell it on april 14th and if you buy on the 14th or 15th you won't be bale to vote.
2021-05-26 17:25:18,wallstreetbets,Sell that shit and we’ll share our tendies

2021-05-26 12:29:42,wallstreetbets,The sell option is determined by everyone’s circumstance. There are people who bought high and maybe borrowed and maybe lied to their girlfriends and parents and are looking for a way out. Also there are churches who maybe waiting to book profits in the name of the lord!
2021-05-26 13:03:56,wallstreetbets,I was a paper hand before. And sold amc for a mere 5% profit. This time I'm holding my shares for weeks and doing my part to keep the price from dropping so the hedge funds wont suck everything left in us apes

2021-05-26 13:17:48,wallstreetbets,"First off, wsb talks about what's volatile cause that's where the fast money comes from. GME and AMC have been trading flat for a few months to now which takes it off our radar so other cults like uwmc and clov can fill in.

Second off, who's to say the apes didn't migrate back to wsb from their subs?"

2021-05-26 13:56:02,wallstreetbets,Voting on issues like which board members to keep is an important play for GME holders because the number of votes cast can be used by the company to prove that the number of shares circulating is greater than the number of shares the company has issued.  With proof can come things like legal retribution or a share recall.
2021-05-26 12:36:16,wallstreetbets,"They still need capital. Which comes from banks and institutions in SOMA. Which has a limit on reverse repos at $80B per institution. 

New HFs need capital to control the price too. The writing is on the wall here. The higher the price and the longer this goes on the more capital is required to control the price or bring it down even a bit. SOMA and the reverse repos are so far keeping the margin calls at bay, but as soon as an institution hits its $80B limit on RRs it's game over for the hedgies."

2021-05-26 16:48:47,wallstreetbets,Who is your broker? Usually they would have sent an email about the vote. Voting is imperative to see the short percentage.
2021-05-26 19:26:25,wallstreetbets,Check your emails I bet you have one telling you to vote
2021-05-26 17:40:22,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, you are correct.  It could lead to the company deciding to split or consolidate stock, which would have a similar effect on those that naked shorted the stock"
2021-05-26 12:44:33,wallstreetbets,Sure they have assets. And we're looking forward to those assets being seized and liquidated by the DTCC.

2021-05-26 12:51:57,wallstreetbets,"so if they have billions is assets (i.e. dollars) cant they raise the price on you like today and then completely tank it like they will tomorrow? Isnt that exactly what has been happening for the past 4 months and the reason why nothing has squeezed? because there is nothing to squeeze and after the actual squeeze in jan, all the HF covered their positions and are now playing with you because as they have known all along....monkeys gonna monke?"

2021-05-26 16:29:13,wallstreetbets,"Dual class shares at Shopify make this highly unlikely unless Tobi (founder and CEO of Shopify) wants to sell to Google. Let’s say that Tobi wants to sell to Google even then it won’t happen. The Canadian government would likely never approve the sale of the only word class Canadian tech company.

Edit...there was also an interview with the former CFO of Shopify a few years back and this question was asked to him. His response was that one day Shopify would like to acquire Google.

2021-05-26 12:58:33,wallstreetbets,It's current PE ratio is ~100 and while growing 100x to justify the price in the next few decades is possible - it is unlikely and what's even more unlikely is making any profit off of a M&A deal with a company so overvalued currently... SHOP is about 9% of Google's market cap - considering Google IP and other assets - if they wanted to spend 150billion on a shopping push they could do it in house and be A LOT more capital efficient

The downplaying of how detrimental CO2 is to our environment is insane.  If it weren’t for our oceans the CO2 levels in the atmosphere would have already killed everyone. Only too bad CO2 plus H2O results in carbonic acid which is turning our whole ocean into an acid bath killing all life, but sure let’s bury our heads in the said and cheer on corporations like Shell who have known for decades that their business operations are destroying the earth."

2021-05-26 18:43:27,wallstreetbets,"You literally had weeks to get it at sub $12. Why would you do that? It's a high probability that you will be stuck in this position for some time - potentially forever if AMC crashes hard and no one bails you out. Just pray more people keep buying so you can dump these shares. 
Bad bad entry man."
2021-05-26 18:50:51,wallstreetbets,I felt dumb buying at $15 but I’m ok now

2021-05-26 13:41:13,wallstreetbets,Hope it works out for you but the AMC action looks like another retail circle jerk and not a short squeeze. There will be no buyers in volume at these prices so there is going to be a whole new generation of AMC bag holders in a couple weeks.
2021-05-26 15:34:49,wallstreetbets,"Buying 3 month high, good job you stupid fuck"

2021-05-26 14:36:02,wallstreetbets,"Yep, just sold today as my average was around there too 400 shares. Originally the plan was to sell 3.5 calls but I quickly backed out of that idea. Didn't sell on the last spike but decided to sell today."
2021-05-26 17:05:25,wallstreetbets,That average only shows that you need to buy moar
2021-05-26 17:17:56,wallstreetbets,You should’ve avg up
2021-05-26 17:20:33,wallstreetbets,"3.23 but I bought more later. At one point it was around yours. And it was more a well thought investment than a meme stock for me (it was before GME first explosion). I only regret to not have taken more.

Only have 200 shares. I'm not autist enough..."
2021-05-26 12:06:14,wallstreetbets,Samesies

2021-05-26 17:37:36,wallstreetbets,"I’m a retard, but the narrative seems to be that the company is sitting at a 97%+ utilization and there are a significant amount of shorts out there. If a recall happens, a squeeze could occur. 

Others are betting on the stock recount that’s supposed to happen next week to push something similar. 

We’ll see. I like the stock."

2021-05-26 15:30:10,wallstreetbets,We’re a school of apes.
2021-05-26 15:39:00,wallstreetbets,"Transferring shares usually takes some time and cost about $75 I think. The upside is you won’t miss out if the SP moves upward but that’s also the downside of it because you can’t sell out of a position either. It’s usually reserved for long term hold.

Otherwise, If you’re not holding long term or don’t wanna spend the fee, just sell out of your positions, withdraw your money and deposit it into your new brokerage."
2021-05-26 16:01:22,wallstreetbets,I don't plan to sell until it changes my life.  I'm not looking for a couple tendies to pay rent. The money is gone.  It's going to zero or many zeroes and I am not selling anywhere in between.

now i'm wishing i had been more greedy; i literally could have doubled my money by waiting a week"
2021-05-26 17:50:53,wallstreetbets,You deserve down votes 😂

2021-05-26 12:45:57,wallstreetbets,14.63 here. I’ll be giving myself a prostate exam in your honor later.
2021-05-26 15:02:24,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps if I created an OF for my gains I could charge people to look at them....too bad I only invested $500 at 2.73 per share, it’s not that impressive."
2021-05-26 13:51:42,wallstreetbets,"In at 10.62, plans to double down at next dip. Original buy in was at 6.55"
2021-05-26 13:55:21,wallstreetbets,"Same here, except I have $4.5  1/21/22 calls. Only ten of them but man was that a smart move."
2021-05-26 15:00:35,wallstreetbets,"It’s very modest since I only have 187 shares, so I’m up 608.72% on my original $500 investment."
2021-05-26 14:44:19,wallstreetbets,I've been eating crayons this whole time. I believe it was GME at $500 for the box.
2021-05-26 16:59:34,wallstreetbets,"Buying crayon calls now, the demand is going to get real high"
2021-05-26 19:23:16,wallstreetbets,"Based on how he looks, I think crayons are least of his worries,  health wise. Still a legendary retard, take care of your health dude."
2021-05-26 15:36:00,wallstreetbets,Except I'm rooting for you!
2021-05-26 18:37:54,wallstreetbets,"geez, what fucking qualification do you need, besides breathing?"
2021-05-26 12:35:01,wallstreetbets,Buying a company worth about $500M at a market cap of $9 Billion is full retard no matter how you do it.
2021-05-26 13:41:33,wallstreetbets,Buying shares at the top of an undeserved price hike is pretty fucking retarded.
2021-05-26 12:29:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you’re right. He thinks he’s retarded, but he’s kinda being safe right now if you think about it."

2021-05-26 15:47:28,wallstreetbets,Bro that guy ate a crayon for you. I hope you make millions and feed him for the rest of his short life.
2021-05-26 17:19:59,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-26 18:19:35,wallstreetbets,"My strategy has been: ""find stocks that were f***ed by covid""

After the first GME fiasco where I made $6k (but then I paper hands) my new strategy is

Never sell anything unless
1. If I hate the stock, no returns, etc. Hold until I break even.
2. If I hate the stock, but a little return, hold until I've made 25%
3. Hold stocks I'm indifferent to until I've cleared 50% profit, then sell enough to cover my initial investment and keep the rest
4. Stocks that I'm making crazy profit: hold until I've reached 1000%, sell 10% to cover initial investment, try to diamond hands as long as possible.

I've got a limit sell for AMC of 25 (of my 50) to sell at 21.70, and another for the rest at $32.55 (for 1500%).

If I'm greedy or panicky I always lose."
2021-05-26 18:33:35,wallstreetbets,Even better 😳🦍
2021-05-26 17:08:05,wallstreetbets,I know right!!!
2021-05-26 17:27:08,wallstreetbets,🤔

2021-05-26 15:43:09,wallstreetbets,Nearly half of all American adults are now vaccinated. Ppl be going to the movies for the long weekend!
2021-05-26 17:58:05,wallstreetbets,Pretty fucked because if it doesn’t squeeze then Adam Aron gonna dilute to pay 6 billion and then amc shareholders won’t even be able to afford the movies bahahha or chapter 11
2021-05-26 15:52:50,wallstreetbets,I wanna be retarded😭
2021-05-26 14:18:50,wallstreetbets,Do you mean buying? Else RIP your shares bud.

2021-05-26 18:04:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I was there too. But, then I doubled down when it did the belly flop. Looking like a retarded Einstein now."
2021-05-26 17:34:14,wallstreetbets,I did 😂
2021-05-26 16:16:28,wallstreetbets,Man fucking same lol. Had to get some skin in the game.
2021-05-26 15:34:47,wallstreetbets,i legit cant tell if you ppl who post this are morons or are here to spread FUD. this comment here is trying to create a bag holder
2021-05-26 15:10:16,wallstreetbets,"You do realize the number of shares are literally over 4x what they were back then, right?

AMC's market cap is higher today than it has ever been in its entire history. And yes, even higher than it was at the top in January."
2021-05-26 15:06:38,wallstreetbets,Bro I sold last week after watching the bounce off of 14 again 😭. Still in GME though so all good.
2021-05-26 18:37:22,wallstreetbets,Well I’m back in so the jokes on me honestly
2021-05-26 15:42:15,wallstreetbets,Name checks out
2021-05-26 12:50:22,wallstreetbets,16.50. I'll be thinking of you all when I autoerotic asphyxiate tonight.
2021-05-26 19:36:50,wallstreetbets,I've got at 9 but I don't think there will be any dip any time soon ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)
2021-05-26 14:00:36,wallstreetbets,"Still awesome.  At the time, they were supposed to go bankrupt and no one had them as a buy.  Definitely a smart move."
2021-05-26 14:56:01,wallstreetbets,Absolute legend.  Do you only eat green crayons?  Also I noticed you washed it down with red Gatorade... What does that mean for the market?
2021-05-26 15:44:10,wallstreetbets,I’m rooting for everyone. I’ll get us a flying party bus when we go to inhabit the moon.
2021-05-26 13:15:31,wallstreetbets,"Market caps are barely related to company values anymore.  Hell, look at RBLX."
2021-05-26 12:36:41,wallstreetbets,"🤣🤣🤣 true. the market is crazy over bought right now, waiting for a pull back, there's lots of talk about the Fed stopping buying as early as next week, and raising interest rates in June...that'll knock things back pretty hard"
2021-05-26 14:43:16,wallstreetbets,oooh you're so WISE give this man a REAL JOB ON WALL STREET
2021-05-26 16:29:32,wallstreetbets,I mean you are not wrong.
2021-05-26 13:47:15,wallstreetbets,Undeserved. This guy. 😂😂
2021-05-26 13:43:18,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2021-05-26 15:50:53,wallstreetbets,"He’s gonna get his own custom made, premium quality crayon set, lying away on the beach, enjoying the better day!"
2021-05-26 19:39:33,wallstreetbets,I think he means he’s selling covered calls on the 100 shares he bought at $7… idk though I’m very retarded
2021-05-26 14:27:27,wallstreetbets,"he's selling them now, at the top"
2021-05-26 16:04:09,wallstreetbets,What does the mean
2021-05-26 16:12:05,wallstreetbets,$40 share price would put AMC's market cap near GME's. Let's hope it gets there and blows past.
2021-05-26 15:24:35,wallstreetbets,Shhhh. The cultists don't like numbers. Numbers scare them. They just see green and think they're winning. Let the children have their fun.
2021-05-26 17:13:41,wallstreetbets,Keep crying bear
2021-05-26 15:34:02,wallstreetbets,All good buy back tf
2021-05-26 18:37:51,wallstreetbets,I’m the only ass clown that bought at the Jan-Feb peak of $18?
2021-05-26 16:55:49,wallstreetbets,It means purple.
2021-05-26 14:11:47,wallstreetbets,Yeah and Roblox too is heavily situated on a house of cards due to collapse anytime... Not sure I'd want that comparison...
2021-05-26 13:09:01,wallstreetbets,I agree with you 100% it’s hard to predict the market. But almost everyone can agree Interest rates are going to rise. Almost no one on Reddit buying this stocks has even seen a bear market. We have been running bull for almost 13 years. But this is how they are set up 100%
2021-05-26 13:51:27,wallstreetbets,Look at the chart for AMC pre-Covid. Sure they deserve to be 5x their price pre-pandemic when there's no movies in theaters and the company is hemorrhaging money 🤡
2021-05-26 15:55:41,wallstreetbets,"If you think this is the top, you're in for a wild ride."
2021-05-26 18:35:37,wallstreetbets,Top is way past $50 lol
2021-05-26 18:35:12,wallstreetbets,"""at the top"".


First time, huh?"
2021-05-26 18:10:53,wallstreetbets,Buy AMC?
2021-05-26 17:14:52,wallstreetbets,"It means there are more shares at a higher price than in its entire history, which doesn't accurately reflect the state of AMC's business"
2021-05-26 18:51:23,wallstreetbets,"It means that you're playing a very risky game buying at these prices. It means there's room for it to fall HARD. The company is obscenely overvalued so outside of hoping for a squeeze,  buying right now is a *terrible* idea. But it also means that a squeeze is less likely, because the number of shares in recent months have drastically increased. If you're betting on shorts not being able to cover because there's not enough shares, and then AMC introduces a shitload more shares into the market, then it just got easier for them to cover.


And most of all it means that you probably shouldn't be buying right know if you didn't know what that meant. I'm not trying to make fun of you or insult you, after all none of us are born with that knowledge, we all were there at one point. But you need to learn more before you jump off into buying highly overvalued stocks hoping for something to happen that is very rare. You could be fine but there is a very high chance that you'll lose a lot of money if you buy at these levels once it all comes crashing down."

2021-05-26 19:54:14,wallstreetbets,Where do you think AMC will go to? I’m trying to talk my wife into buying 5000 I’m sure I can use that ammo
2021-05-26 16:08:57,wallstreetbets,"even if his shares get called away, he’s banking over 100% profit. locking in profit isn’t a bad play"
2021-05-26 18:06:48,wallstreetbets,I'll jump back in at 9
2021-05-26 17:52:09,wallstreetbets,"If you think the current share price has ANYTHING to do with AMC’s business, I have a beach house to sell you in Idaho."
2021-05-26 16:50:40,wallstreetbets,"It will now, because of this cursed comment."
2021-05-26 17:15:58,wallstreetbets,Thanks now it will
2021-05-26 17:24:18,wallstreetbets,"You idiots are so brain dead you guys use AMC and GME interchangeably.

You can't decide whether Ryan Cohen (or AMC's chinese owners) are a good re-opening play and turnarounds or whether business fundamentals don't matter. Which is it??"
2021-05-26 15:00:23,wallstreetbets,It is. That’s why it’s a good play.
2021-05-26 13:56:54,wallstreetbets,All the more reason why this guy buying the top of an **undeserved** price hike is fucked. God you people are fucking dumb.
2021-05-26 17:12:52,wallstreetbets,Don't mention selling or else you'll get downvoted.
2021-05-26 18:36:55,wallstreetbets,How much for the beach house?
2021-05-26 18:49:51,wallstreetbets,Imagine saying amc has poor fundamentals while saying gme has good fundamentals. Your confirmation bias is showing son. Wow look at the fundamentals of gme: selling video games online. Truly unchartered ground.
2021-05-26 13:57:47,wallstreetbets,😂 so short the stock then. Make sure you post that loss porn.

2021-05-26 15:29:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah baby!
2021-05-26 18:34:53,wallstreetbets,"do yall think its gonna spike like gme did? i bought 16 shares when it was like 6$ so im up 200%, but idk if itd be best to hold those mfers or just take my gains rn"
2021-05-26 18:48:27,wallstreetbets,3$ should’ve bought 1000
2021-05-26 18:56:58,wallstreetbets,When was it $3/share?  How long have you been holding?
2021-05-26 18:58:01,wallstreetbets,Hi! New here. I just bought 2 shares of AMC but the app said they are limit orders? Can someone explain this to me?
2021-05-26 19:02:21,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands for those diamond titties
2021-05-26 19:22:42,wallstreetbets,Guaranteed 🤣
2021-05-26 19:44:13,wallstreetbets,"Buy mike tysons punch out!

2021-05-26 11:49:12,wallstreetbets,"I’m in a similar boat as you, but I feel my paper hands getting ready to sell it all now!!


Jesus, y’all have no chill, I was just kidding 😂😂"
2021-05-26 15:29:12,wallstreetbets,"as someone who used to love going to AMC, why? Just why. I understand GME, even though their trade-in system screws everyone over, I understand it cause it's one of the last big game stores open. I wish this was around when Blockbuster was still in business. Was my favorite job despite the pay. I just can't justify investing in a company that charges almost 30 bucks a ticket plus another 15 for popcorn and a drink and, their employees definitely don't see the profit from that much. shouldn't we be rallying around the smaller game and film studios, before they get bought out by the big guys? There's gotta be some out there we can help launch to the moon."
2021-05-26 16:21:20,wallstreetbets,Hoping for >$20 AH

2021-05-26 12:34:30,wallstreetbets,God this sub is so fucking annoying. Literally someone asks a question and every one just yells random shit.
2021-05-26 17:21:08,wallstreetbets,Honestly it's a loaded question because if someone told you 21 dollars they put a cap on it because people would want to sell at 21 if you say the moon and try to convince people to hold it could to way higher
2021-05-26 12:16:50,wallstreetbets,500k

2021-05-26 17:39:14,wallstreetbets,Pluto was a planet when I was in school... and in mind it still is.
2021-05-26 18:44:08,wallstreetbets,"Aside from you giving away your age (The Pluto classification change happened after 2000), where did he ever say it was a planet?"

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Express and other reopening plays Im a big fan of momentum trading and with all cyclinders firing on the economy and jobs numbers some of these reopening stocks are going to have massive gains in the coming months. Express is one of them. It was trading in the 12 to 14 dollar average range prior to covid. Its currently 4 dollars. Add on to that the meme effect and i think it has the potential to go to 16 to 20. Could do something crazy if there is any kind of squeeze. Any other similar reopening plays you guys like?
2021-05-26 11:49:41,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a Wendy's"
2021-05-26 13:39:16,wallstreetbets,commenting to follow this post (and have shares in Express)
2021-05-26 16:34:57,wallstreetbets,"The rotation has basically already finished and we are seeing capital jump to small cap growth. The fact that it didn’t go up already means no one wants it. Have you looked into why they haven’t recovered more? Did they take on a lot of debt during Covid. 

Most reopening plays are betting on people not wanting to stay home any longer, not that they want to shop in stores as opposed to Amazon anymore."
2021-05-26 11:54:47,wallstreetbets,Lmao hard pass
2021-05-26 19:25:09,wallstreetbets,"I think the key is to find recovery plays that are still well off their precovid highs, which are becoming hard to find. My plays here are SABR and COTY, plenty of upside in both those"
2021-05-26 15:19:23,wallstreetbets,u/darkbyte amazing discussions going on here

2021-05-26 19:29:24,wallstreetbets,Nice work man shit
2021-05-26 11:42:40,wallstreetbets,Since when is 10k a yolo play? Lol
2021-05-26 11:40:55,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry it’s only right if I hold it until it’s red right?
2021-05-26 11:43:38,wallstreetbets,"when it makes up 80% of your available funds/portfolio that’s definitely a yolo play, sorry I don’t have 100k to spare dad."
2021-05-26 11:46:52,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, good luck!  this could go side ways in a blink of an eye."
2021-05-26 11:45:45,wallstreetbets,"Just saying man, I’d feel embarrassed posting this as yolo. Seeing others dropping six figures plus. And if that’s the case I’ve been yoloing more than I thought. Just wanted to confirm what were considering yolo."
2021-05-26 11:47:36,wallstreetbets,"Had these calls since February, had them as low as .75 a contract trust me I know LOL"
2021-05-26 11:46:27,wallstreetbets,I would never feel embarrassed making money... to each their own.
2021-05-26 11:51:53,wallstreetbets,Money is money
2021-05-26 11:50:56,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you there, not sure why anyone should be embarrassed about making money? People are weirdos"
2021-05-26 11:57:06,wallstreetbets,Haha I was more referring to using YOLO so casually. And I’m def not short on either of those. Paper handed on one still holding the other. I’ll post my yolo update if 10k is all it takes.
2021-05-26 11:52:40,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂 probably is short amc/gme
2021-05-26 13:18:50,wallstreetbets,"The dollar amount is literally irrelevant. there is no standard for how many dollars are needed to YOLO. OP is just starting out making money, so all they have available to YOLO with is 10k. If you have a 100k and make a 10k trade it’s not a YOLO. But for someone who only has 11k to trade with, 10k is absolutely a YOLO."

2021-05-26 12:17:16,wallstreetbets,Pls for your own sake stop buying at the top.  Stop throwing your hard earned money away. Learn to trade and have some discipline. That being said. AMC TO THE FUCKING MOOON
2021-05-26 12:13:43,wallstreetbets,"Jesus Christ who the fuck let you open an account. 

You're not just a bag holder, you're like one of those bell hops from the 50s who had to carry some movie starlets 50 suitcases for her. 

Whatever chart your using to pick stocks flip it up side down.  You're buying the wrong side of the spike."
2021-05-26 14:01:52,wallstreetbets,This man is our hero! He literally bought all ATH’s and bag-held!
2021-05-26 12:28:06,wallstreetbets,I’d say average down but seems you only buy at the top.
2021-05-26 12:46:04,wallstreetbets,How is it possible to time the absolute peak every single time?
2021-05-26 14:44:13,wallstreetbets,This portfolio is downright amazing.
2021-05-26 16:17:15,wallstreetbets,Dude could be a millionaire if he buys to open put options instead.

2021-05-26 13:53:21,wallstreetbets,"You literally FOMOd into all the hot stocks lol. I’m sorry you did that dude. Next time be more patient and follow the trends when the stock dips, buy, and keep buying every time it dips, then ride the train when it runs up again. Don’t buy when it already went up. You’ve missed the train at that point."
2021-05-26 11:53:44,wallstreetbets,stop trading man. it is not your thing. worst portfolio ever.
2021-05-26 12:14:15,wallstreetbets,You have a knack of buying everything at top 🙏
2021-05-26 12:44:58,wallstreetbets,I thought that the losses were due to weeklies of monthly options. But they are shares?? For real?? I still can’t believe it.
2021-05-26 14:40:48,wallstreetbets,"Bruh you FOMO'd in at the top like every time.

I'm holding BB at 10.76 and that feels eh.

I cannot imagine bag holding at 22.61."
2021-05-26 16:47:01,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding BB too, mostly out of spite"
2021-05-26 16:10:10,wallstreetbets,"I learned my lesson just like this.

Give up the FOMO and stop listening to the people on here for what to buy.

study before every trade! dont buy in because everyone else is.

in my case I woke up and my account tripled, I sold everything before it dropped. looked thru reddit while getting ready for work and placed my orders. And everything crashed.... now if I have Fomo it has to be at a good price for me to get in.

look up some buying signals so this dose not happen again! you will relize if you should invest by looking at the chart."
2021-05-26 14:54:54,wallstreetbets,Reminds me of this guy that got every bet of a 10-bet parlay wrong. It's so bad that it's impressively bad.

2021-05-26 18:52:43,wallstreetbets,"It's impressive at how poorly you time your buys. 
Are you trying to nail the top or is it just FOMO setting in?

My advice, dump it when it goes green and withdraw that money from your account. Then put that money into a 180 day deposit account. Leave it there until it matures and rinse and repeat until you are 65. Retire. Oh, and never buy stocks again."
2021-05-26 19:30:09,wallstreetbets,Where's Nokia? Oh it hasn't hit its peak yet for you to buy.

2021-05-26 12:03:37,wallstreetbets,"You are smart to diversify your portfolio. Tesla is one of those stocks that you hold for thirty years.It WILL take off one day.

Diamond Hands for Tesla is legitimately a good move.

However, your portfolio sucks because you bought high. AMC is at a peak and Game Stop's rally has already finished. Blackberry is actually a good bet because of their new 5-G computer phone."
2021-05-26 11:49:01,wallstreetbets,I mean I have the magic of buying and changing the direction to go the opposite of whatever I was hoping for but this is next level shit right here!

2021-05-26 15:13:29,wallstreetbets,Even more impressive is the fact that he managed to wait until the very top to buy. And I thought my luck was bad...

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UVXY reverse stock split This could be very bad for bag holders who bought at say $7.00.  Now, you need to pick up $30 for even, not $3.00.  The S&P would need to tumble dramatically to reach that market price.

That being said, the reverse also diminished the amount of shares available from 8.3 billion to 838 million.  I can see a rush on remaining shares is probable even if the S&P rises. 

June will be the tell all month for the indices.  So much is over valued, inflation has shown itself, home prices are rising and so are interest rates, raw products and manufacturing production are on just in time mode.  None of industries or suppliers want to be burden with inventory setting when demand slows or even halts. 

Keeping the inventories low will command higher prices for goods thereby creating a vacuum for import products.  Then the domestic manufacturers and suppliers will once again be competing with low priced imports.  This is good and bad.

The good is employers will be relieved from trying to hiring just some skin with a pulse.  It will also be good for manufacturers who still have production overseas.

The bad is unemployment, or at the very least harder to find a job because these jobs will be reserved for the real producers.  A rikity diploma from some liberal college will have no leverage and mean nothing again.  A high school graduation diploma from California or the likes will be a joke, even in that state.  Inflation and interest rates will rise.  Home sales, as we found the truth out today, will fall.  

Happened in the 70's, interest rates hit 20%+.  It was more lucrative to deposit money in the banks, which this money normally used for investing.  The saving rates were higher than their return on risk of building, risk of investment in stocks, risk of expansion.

Happened again in the start of the 80's, interest rate tipping 18.75%+.  Unemployment rise again.  Foreclosures daily.

In the 90's, interest rates for mortgage were at about 10%+.  Then later in the 90's, it subsided to around 7%. 

History keeps repeating itself.  Lived it, seems like reruns."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Curiosity stream (CURI) DD The streaming industry is getting a lot of exposure
lately with all the news from Disney+ and HBO max.
Looking for a pure play in the streaming service
came across Curiosity Stream. Basically the platform
offers documentaries about science, history, politics,
etc... and they have over 3000+ titles in the platform.
The founder is John Hendricks, founder and former
chairman of Discovery.

After digging a little bit I was surprised to see that
despite having 13M subscribers total revenue for Q3
was only $8.9M, giving an ARPU of only $0.15 which
seems ridiculous for the amount of value you are
getting. It seems like a good amount of the subscriber
base comes from bundled packages at a heavy
discount. They are looking for exposure while growing
at all costs. Here are some key point:
• The company has no debt and $180M cash in the
balance sheet.
• The company went from 2M bundled subscriptions in
Q1 2019 to 13M in Q3 2020
· Over 60% gross margin
• They project 10x growth by 2025 with $400M in
revenues

Giving the uncertainty of the current market
environment it seems pretty safe to buy something
that sells $1 a month subscriptions and is disrupting
an industry, targeting a more sophisticated customers
instead of the average becky who likes stranger things.
The last time John Hendricks created something
(Discovery) he turned a $5M investment into a
$32B company before stepping down and creating
CuriosityStream.
I believe we could see a jump to 19 dollars by the end of september.

Side note: John Hendricks has been buying shares this
month increasing his position by 21%.

2021-05-26 13:46:04,wallstreetbets,6/25 isn't next Friday though.
2021-05-26 15:32:11,wallstreetbets,6/4 (the ops contract) the whole reason this discussion is happening is next week
2021-05-26 15:35:49,wallstreetbets,So again I ask what catalyst is happening in the next 7 days to have an affect on the contract that the op posted
2021-05-26 15:43:47,wallstreetbets,OP doesn't seem to have a reason.  He's just riding the wave.
2021-05-26 15:50:56,wallstreetbets,Which is why I responded to a comment that said “also with catalyst coming” asking what catalysts are coming. Did you even read the previous comments?

I’ve been on the train for so long I don’t know if I have the strength to purchase another ticket. What a way to end such an epic saga. Fuck. Me."

2021-05-26 11:58:20,wallstreetbets,I’m new to trading and got in on amc when it was around $6 early in the pandemic and went in for 100 shares. Can someone explain why this is happening?

2021-05-26 19:41:32,wallstreetbets,I just have to ask: Are these *realized* losses or just paper losses? I can't imagine that Ortex has the ability to tell the difference unless they are watching the short interest actually decrease by a certain value since that would mean that the short positions are genuinely closing.
2021-05-26 19:42:39,wallstreetbets,Fuck imagine how much they lost today

2021-05-26 16:16:51,wallstreetbets,Just checking in. It's not me. I'm up 250% since January.
2021-05-26 16:58:41,wallstreetbets,I'm looking forward to the next generation of would-be trust fund babies that have to grow up and get a job. Their parents will tell them how it's all our fault and they will grow up resenting reddit.
2021-05-26 13:39:32,wallstreetbets,they have their own meltdown subs to make each other feel better. so they have their support network lol
2021-05-26 13:54:14,wallstreetbets,Lol and they know both are squeezing eventually and we really are too retarded to sell now!
2021-05-26 13:59:16,wallstreetbets,Yessss.... * *eyes roll back* *.... I can FEEEEL your anger
2021-05-26 14:19:44,wallstreetbets,he must have punched his monitor by now
2021-05-26 14:06:15,wallstreetbets,Cramer? Is it Jim?
2021-05-26 15:51:50,wallstreetbets,Yeah me......for not buying more in the dip
2021-05-26 18:31:37,wallstreetbets,Imagine running a hedge fund and getting wiped out by a bunch of apes applauding a dude sticking a banana up his ass. Just the icing on the cake.
2021-05-26 16:32:16,wallstreetbets,Bet they're laughing at what a dumb dickhead their boss is while searching for new jobs and stealing everything that isn't nailed down.
2021-05-26 18:13:51,wallstreetbets,Someone having a gme meltdown 🤣🤣
2021-05-26 16:34:11,wallstreetbets,That shit made me laugh so hard!
2021-05-26 16:39:57,wallstreetbets,Direct them to that one guy with the banana up his ass
2021-05-26 16:42:43,wallstreetbets,that makes me laaaaaugh!

2021-05-26 12:25:18,wallstreetbets,So far.......
2021-05-26 12:21:51,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-26 12:27:14,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-26 13:24:37,wallstreetbets,"Do they actually lose money, or is this one of those situations where you lose money on paper, but don't actually lose anything till you sell?"
2021-05-26 18:35:00,wallstreetbets,This is the LOSS PORN I came here for.
2021-05-26 13:26:48,wallstreetbets,That M needs to become a Z (zillion) on order to make an impact
2021-05-26 14:00:37,wallstreetbets,"I mean if the 2000%ish number is true, yeah that's just pennies compared to what's to come."
2021-05-26 14:40:59,wallstreetbets,It’s probably way higher than they’re actually reporting. This number is based on the new FINRA calculation for SI... which we all know is horse shit.
2021-05-26 14:51:44,wallstreetbets,But is this a paper loss or actual loss?  Because it may end up they don’t lose anywhere near this right?  The valuation of their short position lost that much but I doubt they closed them.
2021-05-26 16:48:11,wallstreetbets,Actually it was 754m Tuesday alone
2021-05-26 17:02:57,wallstreetbets,And that they'll admit to 🚀
2021-05-26 12:52:48,wallstreetbets,This week
2021-05-26 13:11:19,wallstreetbets,Shit that's on Tuesday alone.

2021-05-26 13:51:10,wallstreetbets,Who will end up paying me for my stocks? I feel like this is gonna turn into an IOU and the government will them hedge funds go bankrupt and not do anything about them paying out for the stock and then no one can sell.
2021-05-26 14:01:23,wallstreetbets,what? did they buy a single share back?
2021-05-26 14:09:49,wallstreetbets,"The way, this is"
2021-05-26 14:21:53,wallstreetbets,Make them bleed
2021-05-26 14:43:08,wallstreetbets,Yeah what the hell is this ? Those are rookie numbers.

2021-05-26 17:38:55,wallstreetbets,Good.
2021-05-26 17:42:48,wallstreetbets,It’s all about the *money* *money* *money*

2021-05-26 18:28:49,wallstreetbets,Unreal success!  Great job to all the AMC holders.
2021-05-26 13:47:43,wallstreetbets,"The numbers speak for themselves. This type of short squeezing has offered many the once in a lifetime opportunity to make some crazy gains that is within their comfort zone (stock market vs lottery, casino, illegal activities). The reassurance they have to YOLO again comes from a place where if more people are doing it, the more people will feel comfortable being in the same boat. Humans find comfort in their peers and shared intentions/actions.

Regulations won’t work or won’t be a viable option from the public perspective, because they have the right to spend and allocate their money in a way that they see fit. 

Their leader needs to lose a bunch of money (I like the stock k. Gill? Guy) in order to rattle the tree from top to bottom.

More promising yet realistic/reasonable gains from more stable and government backed bonds REIT’s etc can be one way to disincentivize YOLOING, or GME (gamestop) themselves need to come out with a PR statement saying they will close their doors if regulations aren’t out in place in their shorting/options trades out of fear for those who have lost crazy sums of money believing in their name.

Leaders and leadership come together to inspire confidence, from different levels that have varying financial interests. If a big name from GME, bb, amc etc say no more short squeeze or else the doors will close, then there will be some “normalcy” returned to the market"
2021-05-26 13:38:59,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-05-26 14:16:42,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure they lost something like $2.6B during the initial rally. Melvin had to bail them out.
2021-05-26 13:51:18,wallstreetbets,Yea i want a screenshot of citadel's RH account

2021-05-26 14:08:52,wallstreetbets,Ok that deserves front page for this comment
2021-05-26 14:13:41,wallstreetbets,One of the best YOLO losses ever and they will never even admit it.
2021-05-26 14:25:45,wallstreetbets,Most underrated comment of the week.
2021-05-26 16:19:35,wallstreetbets,"From the 08 vw skweez

Porsche wins. Everyone else loses.  Big. As a result of its skillful financial engineering, Porsche netted itself more than $10 billion in profits in a matter of just a few short weeks.  It was money that was badly needed by Porsche.  Luxury car sales were plunging due to the crisis and Porsche was already saddled with significant debt.

On the other side of the trade, the hedge funds who had sold VW short quickly saw their collective losses exceed $30 billion.  ** [Hedge fund](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/3281537/Porsche-and-VW-share-row-how-Germany-got-revenge-on-the-hedge-fund-locusts.html) managers were “literally in tears on the phone” as they described “a nuclear bomb going off in our faces.”**"
2021-05-26 14:08:11,wallstreetbets,But how am I gonna buy the dip?
2021-05-26 14:39:00,wallstreetbets,"I kind of want to sell my positions and gains in AMC, and withdraw the money to masturbate with while looking at their losses."
2021-05-26 14:56:03,wallstreetbets,Could you imagine the internet points they’d get if they did!
2021-05-26 15:06:23,wallstreetbets,Ugh

2021-05-26 15:42:41,wallstreetbets,I pulled out because I didn't see any signs of improvement (been holding since the beginning and lost more than 50% and got too low for comfort.) I traded for coin hoping to catch the uptick and then then it tanked. Had I just waited for today I would have broken even.
2021-05-26 15:49:20,wallstreetbets,Give me the guh's
2021-05-26 15:51:14,wallstreetbets,That would break the fucking sub

2021-05-26 10:44:04,wallstreetbets,"Their shorts got covered, all right—just not in the way they were hoping.  Kenny might want to stock up on some Depends.  It’s gonna be a bumpy ride!"

2021-05-26 10:14:33,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-05-26 13:57:47,wallstreetbets,"I mean yes they probably did cover, then they re-entered a short position. 

It’s not like you can’t short and cover over and over again."
2021-05-26 12:56:23,wallstreetbets,You understand that the pool of shorts could have rotated by now right? The big guys could have covered back then and since then more but smaller hedge funds started to short.
2021-05-26 14:32:51,wallstreetbets,Shorts are never going to be zero.  Short interest is 17%.
2021-05-26 13:26:56,wallstreetbets,"More importantly, how do people who are still shorting GME still have jobs?"
2021-05-26 15:09:42,wallstreetbets,Sure… they covered in January… but then they opened new short positions.
2021-05-26 12:03:21,wallstreetbets,"Na, covered last week"
2021-05-26 15:02:12,wallstreetbets,"I am not invested and I have been hearing a lot about Shorting and GME, I understand shorting now but what does it mean to have a short covered?"
2021-05-26 15:03:59,wallstreetbets,"Bet they wish they did now!

Apes Together STRONG!"
2021-05-26 16:25:54,wallstreetbets,I think they covered the *inside* of their shorts back then.
2021-05-26 18:54:04,wallstreetbets,those can be new shorts?
2021-05-26 10:38:44,wallstreetbets,🤣💀📈
2021-05-26 11:10:36,wallstreetbets,"Yup it was actually crazy how much they manipulated that stock. Create fake news reports, forcing brokerages to halt trades, just ridiculous. And they somehow got away without any penalties from the SEC 😒"
2021-05-26 12:12:30,wallstreetbets,"Melvin: “we closed all our public shorts”

Everyone: “and the non public ones?”

Some legal dumbass at Melvin: “you don’t have to answer that”"
2021-05-26 11:55:12,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they covered, then shorted again, lol."
2021-05-26 12:08:00,wallstreetbets,They covered alright...they're covered in deep shit 6 feet under once the rocket has lifted.
2021-05-26 13:06:20,wallstreetbets,"Them: “Aw shit, here we go lying again”"
2021-05-26 15:17:35,wallstreetbets,"Odd how 754 mil divided by a $30 price increase comes to just over 25 mil shorts, almost as if the entire float is shorted eh? Wouldn't be surprised if 754 mil was the highest number they were allowed to report"

2021-05-26 14:05:22,wallstreetbets,I thought reddit was shorting silver.
2021-05-26 11:02:54,wallstreetbets,Consult the well-researched DDs done by teenage boys as they all show they have not covered and the PT is 20 million per fucking share.
2021-05-26 12:12:55,wallstreetbets,Is is aging nicely
2021-05-26 12:19:01,wallstreetbets,Sure they did bud
2021-05-26 12:33:03,wallstreetbets,Funny how that works huh?
2021-05-26 12:40:05,wallstreetbets,Lol right?
2021-05-26 13:51:51,wallstreetbets,"I can believe that they did cover at one point but are trying the same moves again because they have foolish pride like us, and way more money to waste (for now lol)."
2021-05-26 14:06:45,wallstreetbets,makes no sense right? like how could they have losses if they already covered their short positions? seriously.. what a head scratcher!
2021-05-26 14:12:31,wallstreetbets,At least twice. /s
2021-05-26 15:12:35,wallstreetbets,they did cover. then they doubled down. I love watching the autists fight it out.
2021-05-26 12:15:06,wallstreetbets,"You know the article assumes the lost if the 20% short covers at the spot price? The calculation is 20% of the shorts that still exist and current spot price. The 20% that is still short didn't lose shit until they cover , only money they losing is from the borrow fee."
2021-05-26 12:58:30,wallstreetbets,After they made billions too
2021-05-26 13:11:41,wallstreetbets,Yeah they really need to keep their messaging straight/consistent.
2021-05-26 15:52:32,wallstreetbets,"If they didn’t cover, why shut down trading? Specifically, buying by retail? Do you know how the stock market works?

0 volume means 0 price movement. Prices only rise when people buy at the ask or higher. Prices only fall when people sell at the bid or lower. 

If we assume they shut down buying to help institutions who were short, we must assume that they allowed institutions to keep buying. Otherwise, the price doesn’t move which means shorts get no help at all. 

That means the only way shutting down buying by retail helps is if it allows shorts to cover by driving the price down by buying at the bid or lower. Ergo, if prices dropped after trading was halted then shorts had to have covered. 

Also, there’s no losses if they don’t cover. Nobody reports or tracks unrealized losses because nobody gives a fuck about unrealized anything. 

So yes, they already covered. Besides, no broker in the world is going to let somebody carry such a huge losing short position this long. Every single GME and AMC price spike is almost certainly the result of a broker issuing a margin call on a losing short position. 

By all means, keep buying and holding. It’s worked so far. If ain’t broke, don’t fix it. That doesn’t mean continuously repeating stupid shit is a good thing."
2021-05-26 12:21:49,wallstreetbets,They did. There is 21% short interest which is pretty typical of any stock.

Their next move will be to find the ones who led this movement, and either pay them off or blackmail them. Private investigators, etc."

2021-05-26 14:48:54,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much this. I bought some gme when it was pretty high and some AMC. Not because I expected it to really go up more, but because I saw regular people like myself making an impact.  I only bought as much as I could hold indefinitely."
2021-05-26 15:04:25,wallstreetbets,"same for me.  I'm not in for the money, I'm just here because I wanted to be part of that crazy rollercoaster ride.  It's like I've already paid for the ticket I do not expect any money back."
2021-05-26 15:14:19,wallstreetbets,This is so incomprehensible to them that's it's basically the entire explanation of why they've struggled so much to understand what's happening and probably never will. The fact they are literally hated by millions of ~~people~~ their victims has never been considered as a possibility much less the answer to all of their questions.
2021-05-26 16:44:59,wallstreetbets,"same. I woke up and my fidelity account had more money and I was like oh sundial must be up. Nope, the money I don't care about it is doing stuff again."
2021-05-26 13:30:20,wallstreetbets,"I bought at a really shitty time. And was waiting until I got back in the green before letting go. Wasn't about to take a loss. Just had to wait it out. Should've bought when it cratered though. Since I had to wait it out anyway. 

Edited for clarity, still haven't sold."
2021-05-26 14:17:36,wallstreetbets,True madlads
2021-05-26 16:48:49,wallstreetbets,Just same. Haven't even checked my portfolio until I read this news. Feel like I need to buy more when it's crazy high

Put a few grand on AMC and GME. forgot about it!   
I did the same thing with ford 2 years ago"
2021-05-26 17:30:16,wallstreetbets,Me too!  Since it has been boring I haven't even checked in the last few months.  I'm not even sure how many shares I have because I forgot my password for my stock account.

2021-05-26 14:37:26,wallstreetbets,"Cause it's the principle. If they keep us down trodden and ripping out each other's throats, the more their power base grows. They leave us just enough line to believe in a complete capitalist system is the best choice to continue their games, but as soon as we gain a major victory, it can seriously destabilize their whole system. Just imagine, a bunch of disorganized retards on reddit not only PROVED 100 percent how fucking deep the media is in the elites pockets AND bankrupts those same institutions? People will start thinking, if they can do that, what can we achieve organized and intelligent?"
2021-05-26 15:00:07,wallstreetbets,"Because the bigger their “club” gets, the less power they hold over us. The more people that are able to lift themselves up to wealth, the fewer people they have to trample on and manipulate. 

That's why billionaires want to hoard all the wealth."

2021-05-26 14:43:27,wallstreetbets,"Friday is suspiciously short-term. 

You want to hold AMC until we are in full recovery mode,We still have summer blockbusters to get through, an upcoming Marvel movie, and December tends to be another big movie month.

Better to hold for the long term."

2021-05-26 17:21:33,wallstreetbets,Well there all a lot of memes.
2021-05-26 18:59:03,wallstreetbets,#noapeleftbehind
2021-05-26 11:20:00,wallstreetbets,Sell some to get a gain and let rest of the free money ride if you are unsure.
2021-05-26 11:32:27,wallstreetbets,"If you have money to spend, no.

Otherwise, sell half. It's like blackjack gambling strategy. You reduce risk and if you have an opportunity you just double down.

You would make the same if GME were to double to $500 with your remaining half, which is possible.

I would sell before they officially announced their NFT. Who knows what Elon will do to tank that."
2021-05-26 13:41:21,wallstreetbets,"Depends how high you think it'll go.

Personally, with theaters inevitably re-opening soon-ish, and with the ""meme""-like attention this stock is getting,  I see this as being either the next GME, or a mini GME.

I fully expect it to be $100+ within a year or two. If you believe the same, then you'd kick yourself for not buying now."
2021-05-26 11:12:54,wallstreetbets,"I love it because I bought 10 shares at $10 and have just been pretending it doesn't exist, but silently cheering when it's big green."
2021-05-26 11:50:06,wallstreetbets,I unfortunately for money reasons had to sell my AMC last week when it got to 13 but I’m still deep in GME and I’ll be rooting for those still in AMC !!
2021-05-26 11:51:09,wallstreetbets,You think AMC is bad? Check BB.
2021-05-26 19:38:54,wallstreetbets,Because they we're both 5 bucks a piece last year and one is 240 and the other is 18..
2021-05-26 15:12:47,wallstreetbets,"Amc is actually a lot hotter than GME right now. 

Gme last 20 days low of 136 jump to 240.  76% gain.

Amc 8.93 to 19.9. 123% gain."
2021-05-26 15:40:23,wallstreetbets,"Because GME is the only really good investment, AMC is not going to make you even 1/10 the profits"
2021-05-26 13:17:03,wallstreetbets,"[See this discussion](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/135579/who-is-liable-when-a-short-seller-goes-bankrupt). If the broker themselves are somehow successfully pulling the wool over regulators’ eyes and acting in bad faith as a counterparty (say rehypothecating far in excess of allowed limits), then it would be interesting to watch how that creditor tower unwinds."
2021-05-26 13:39:47,wallstreetbets,Cant shake the feeling that these posts are from people who have a vested interested in raising the stock price and they try to use memes in order to influence ignorant redditors to dump all their money and hold an undiversified position in GME. It’s just dishonest at some point and it would be great if this shit never made it to the front page of Reddit.
2021-05-26 13:46:24,wallstreetbets,"I don't get them either and I find it funny that individuals believe stuff like this easily, but cry fake news, manipulation, etc. if the article stated they made 754 million."
2021-05-26 15:36:30,wallstreetbets,"The point is clickbait, and as you can see it’s working perfectly. And it’s not even the first time they posted an article like this.

None of the information is based on any filings or any other financial documents. They basically took the 20ish % short interest, and “multiplied” it with the price increase, and call it an article.

Funny thing is that most people praising this as best new ever first of all refuse to believe the 20% SI that the article uses, and they refuse to believe the opposite articles - using the same mathematical formula - when the price goes down and shorts make money."
2021-05-26 13:31:37,wallstreetbets,"Yea, and the article isnt mentioning how much bagholders lost when they bought in at 350"
2021-05-26 17:16:53,wallstreetbets,The point of the article is to mislead the public and get us to sell. If you haven’t figured out how the media works yet you probably should soon.
2021-05-26 14:07:04,wallstreetbets,"Just get another ticket

2021-05-26 18:59:47,wallstreetbets,"If you're looking for chump change? $50-100

If you're looking for life changing ape change? $100k-500k

You decide when you want to sell. Whether or not you regret that decision, if it goes higher...well that's also on you."
2021-05-26 14:08:45,wallstreetbets,"When you short a stock, you borrow shares and you sell them. If the prices goes down, you can buy them back at a lower price and thus a profit. If the prices goes UP UP UP, now to buy it back, they have to fork out MORE money than what they sold it for."

2021-05-26 10:33:01,wallstreetbets,I imagine whatever price it’s at when the Hedgefunds cry to the Government and the government shuts down trading and then bails the HFs out
2021-05-26 10:55:56,wallstreetbets,"I think it could have surpassed 1k last time, but that's about it. Too many people would take profits for it to have gone much higher than 1k, I think the upper limit wasn't much higher than 694.20 robinhood not fucked everyone over. 

This time I don't think it will have the same potential. Maybe 500 this time. (You've got to break through the meme price of 420.69 to even get to 500, and meme prices are a totally logical limit for a meme stock)."
2021-05-26 10:33:27,wallstreetbets,"You are right, 10k or 1 mil is not realistic. I'd go with about 20 mil as a floor."
2021-05-26 14:33:20,wallstreetbets,"Realistically right under 1k is where it has the most potential. All these people screaming about “diamond hands to 1mil” are delusional. Once the selling starts (and it will start) then it’s a race to the bottom. 

Good luck on the tendies"
2021-05-26 11:02:30,wallstreetbets,Around 6969420
2021-05-26 19:01:24,wallstreetbets,"The price to sell at is very simple.  As long as more and more new investors can be brought in and GME is sold at ever higher prices, it will keep rising.

At some point there's going to be money on the sidelines that for whatever reason won't buy.  Every asset has a peak eventually.

My view?  This thing runs until the meeting in June likely.  After that I don't think anyone really knows what will happen."
2021-05-26 10:52:54,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-26 13:41:45,wallstreetbets,Realistically they’ll probably keep letting little sharts out that bring the price up to 200-250 and then wait like a month for it to settle back down and then let another little shart out and let it settle and keep doing that for the next 100 years or so. I really doubt they’ll ever let the price get as high as it was in the past.
2021-05-26 13:00:59,wallstreetbets,"Please let the rest of us know when you're about to buy a new phone, maybe for your wife's boyfriend or whoever. It'll be a good time for the rest of us to buy. As good as any other indicator out there!"
2021-05-26 13:02:26,wallstreetbets,"No one knows. You have to think about your own risk tolerance and determine your own expectations. Everyone wants everybody to hold because if we do then we can set our price to a certain degree but its ignorant to think that everyone will hold up to $x.xx because that just isn't rational human behavior.

EDIT: Also if your goal is the moon then do not try to sell and buy at a lower price because you will risk your chance at the moon. If your goal is to swing trade the stock to make money, to average down your price/share or to increase your share amount then maybe the risk of missing the moon is worth the gamble of selling now and hoping the price drops. 

Keep in mind though that every time someone sells it gives hedgies the chance to improve their position."
2021-05-26 11:58:48,wallstreetbets,"There are no demands.

Sometimes you just time things poorly 🤷"
2021-05-26 15:17:52,wallstreetbets,"when they short they borrow shares and sell them immediately to buy back at lower price and make profit, so to close a short position you need to buy back the shares you borrowed and return them to the lender."

No. I'm sure the SEC is working up a fine of $75k on billions of fraud and a certificate for the largest fuckery hole ever created."

2021-05-26 12:29:02,wallstreetbets,The sec was created by the corrupt for the corrupt
2021-05-26 14:49:43,wallstreetbets,I for one will never forget the hundreds of stories about gme being dead in the water and retail investors losing millions collectively around February to early March before the second big rally that brought it to $350. And these stories were calling it dead literally just a few days after it started dropping. It’s honestly a life lesson to show you how much bullshit we probably are being fed on a regular basis by media who’s being bought out by billionaires.
2021-05-26 14:13:55,wallstreetbets,"I would like to know how much was spent on market manipulation around GME, and how that compares to potential losses for hedge funds. 

Have they broken even yet, or is it still worth it for them to spend money on advertising BS?"
2021-05-26 15:35:08,wallstreetbets,If they will do that for two stocks what do you think they will do when they want to go to war or push their shitty agenda. This whole thing has opened my eyes to how fucked our system really is and where the power really lies.
2021-05-26 15:39:17,wallstreetbets,"All indications are that this just the tip of the iceberg.  There's a ton of short interest still unaccounted for, and no indication that the price will drop far enough for it to cover at a net profit."
2021-05-26 13:48:31,wallstreetbets,"> And they somehow got away without any penalties from the SEC 😒

Just FYI, you will not see sanctions from regulators immediately. That is not how it works. We do not know whether the SEC or other securities regulators are going to sanction anyone yet, and that's perfectly normal. Despite what reddit seems to think, sanctions require an investigation first."

2021-05-26 18:41:29,wallstreetbets,'Somehow'.
2021-05-26 18:54:36,wallstreetbets,"Can't speak to fake new claims, but the halting of buying stock isn't the brokerages fault. Collateral is required while transactions on stock clear, and that takes a few days, of which collateral needs to account for price moves during that time. 

Raising stock means rising collateral.

Crazy rising stock means crazy high collateral.

At some point it gets too high for a broker to take on that level of collateral and they can't offer a sale on that stock anymore.

I'm sure they did other things that are shitty, but I was too itchy with the trigger finger when it came to accusing them of manipulating the market, when it's actually the clearing house which sets the collateral rules for them. Not defending anything else they've done, but at least this one is out of brokers hands"
2021-05-26 19:28:14,wallstreetbets,John Oliver recently did a story on getting a totally bogus health story onto several local news stations. Would love for him to drop a GME episode.

2021-05-26 16:59:52,wallstreetbets,AMC was also a target of naked shorting hedge funds but because their market cap was under a billion dollars all posts related to AMC were deleted from WSB during the first round of hype in mid-Jan (banned ticker). It also wasn't shorted nearly as heavily as GME so there is inherently less squeeze potential.

Makes no sense right? 

Well if you average it out suddenly your obligation to buy shares matches your obligation to sell shares. Suddenly, on a purely number of shares basis, you're neutral and no need to report.

Anyway that's the conspiracy theory, no idea if it's true or not."

2021-05-26 13:15:02,wallstreetbets,Even with it included in rent I don’t bother plugging the cable in. Trying to find something or watch something in tv is so nauseating.  So many commercials and so much wasted time looking for something good which you catch half way through. If I listen to cable news like Rachel Madow it’s through her podcast.  When I watch sports it’s streaming or a vod.

I used to be young and somewhat ahead of the curve. I stopped watching TV in 2006. I pirate TV shows.

2021-05-26 12:17:42,wallstreetbets,"Specifically, and a separate point, the deleted posts in this thread were talking about ""stop the steal"" Qanon bullshit.

Yeah, conspiracies are real. But most conspiracies are bullshit. And most of the people going around spouting off some conspiratorial shit and failing to precisely use their words and cite credible sources, alluding to vague, shadowy, half-baked, crackpot ideas they saw on youtube while attempting to paint some villain (the media, the Jews, the democrats, etc...) are always the ones who are talking about the bullshit conspiracies, the dangerous conspiracies that end up with a bunch of methheads storming the capitol."
2021-05-26 12:13:03,wallstreetbets,"Right, and overarching generalizations that attempt to vaguely erode trust in social institutions don't help. 

If you want specific changes to be made, if you want accountability then you can't just wave your arms around and waggle your eyebrows knowingly and dance around the point with vagaries. 

Specifically, we can say with confidence that with the information we have it is safe to conclude that Citadel didn't cover their shorts in Jan. Being honest hurts them financially, they have more to lose being honest than they do from paying the fines for being dishonest, and they have a track record of 50+ instances where they have been fined for failing to report accurate data. 

We can say all that about Citadel because we can put those facts and data points together. Pointing an accusatory finger at some media boogeyman because ""z0Mg tHeY bElieVe ThE ShORts"" when all ""the media"" is doing is relaying the numbers that have been reported (which, that's their job) is a glaring failure of intellectual integrity."

>Although nearly all domain experts agree that human CO2 emissions are altering the world's climate, segments of the public remain unconvinced by the scientific evidence. Internet blogs have become a vocal platform for climate denial, and bloggers have taken a prominent and influential role in questioning climate science. We report a survey (N > 1100) of climate blog users to identify the variables underlying acceptance and rejection of climate science. Paralleling previous work, we find that endorsement of a laissez-faire conception of free-market economics predicts rejection of climate science (r ' .80 between latent constructs). Endorsement of the free market also predicted the rejection of other established scientific findings, such as the facts that HIV causes AIDS and that smoking causes lung cancer. We additionally show that endorsement of a cluster of conspiracy theories (e.g., that the CIA killed Martin-Luther King or that NASA faked the moon landing) predicts rejection of climate science as well as the rejection of other scientific findings, above and beyond endorsement of laissez-faire free markets. This provides empirical confirmation of previous suggestions that conspiracist ideation contributes to the rejection of science. Acceptance of science, by contrast, was strongly associated with the perception of a consensus among scientists."

2021-05-26 13:40:06,wallstreetbets,"It’s been great since the start of the GME run and the insane addition of new members, random dates have been tossed around the last 5 months."
2021-05-26 13:11:22,wallstreetbets,There’s also no reason to believe that they aren’t continuing to build those positions rather than close them. Hence why there’s always a “big day” to rally everyone behind. I don’t think people realize how long they can keep this up
2021-05-26 13:19:03,wallstreetbets,"If not June 2nd, we will try again June 3rd."
2021-05-26 13:45:03,wallstreetbets,"No idea but I thought the hedge funds could trade shorts back and forth to reset the time they have to cover. 

So they can stay short as long as they can pay the short interest?"

2021-05-26 14:30:46,wallstreetbets,AMC moved the voting back to 6/2. so this person means that voting begins 6/2 to see how many actual shares are out there
2021-05-26 14:30:50,wallstreetbets,"It's not the last day for them to cover. From what I've read is the day we can find out how many actual shares of amc are available by votes. So it is important to vote. Not the best explanation, I'm sure there is someone who can do better."
2021-05-26 14:36:52,wallstreetbets,There’s not a set date shorts have to cover. As long as they can keep paying interest they can hold the short as long as they want. The only problem is the interest is bleeding them dry. They are loosing millions each time they pay interest. Eventually they’ll give up but there’s no set date.
2021-05-26 14:41:47,wallstreetbets,Because that’s the day that specific persons calls expire and they don’t want you to pull out until after they have cashed in.

I mean, of course. The entire point of regulation is bureaucratic. You cannot have consistency in complex undertakings without a substantial amount of bureaucracy, and if nothing else, regulation must be consistent. There is no practical way to regulate financial markets without it.

> Even if they're doing the right thing at top speed (which I admittedly doubt) it may take years and we don't see much in the meantime

This is a valid criticism, and certainly the SEC has many flaws. I'd like to see far more funding going to hiring more regulators that impose harsher penalties more quickly generally in many fields, the securities industry included. But at the end of the day, there is no reasonably practical way to move on something like this immediately. Regulators cannot make snap judgments like people on reddit can without seriously damaging their credibility and hunches are not evidence. On top of all of that, securities markets, laws, and rules are extremely complex. Just sorting through the legal issues and getting it right takes a lot of time and effort."

It’d be a big investment, but they could sell the ads directly, they could give discounts to advertisers where players themselves were owners or majority investors. They’d make their money back so fast.

MSN, CNBC, Cramer, etc have all touched on GME too in the past 5 months. Pretending like they didn't just to win an internet argument says more about you than me. Enjoy your pedantic ways.

Maybe I didn’t make myself clear or maybe I didn’t mention it in this exchange. I’ve had conversations with ex CIA operatives on the covert ops and control they leverage on us; as well as first hand from a good friend about the “Clinton Body Count” and his family member being the second one on that list. Why am I sharing this with you? You will most likely shrug it off and say all the media can’t be wrong or manipulated. You ever heard the story of the frog in warm water being cooked slowest without even a fight? Your the frog. How does this apply to stocks? Only that the economy, inflation, interest rates, money and the markets are controlled. What does any of this info help you guys reading??

Since then I've bought more GME at every dip. Though, while GME has been slowly rising, AMC did not seem to be doing well. But, I had just as much faith in that stock. It also looks over-shorted, and there's no way their stock doesn't rocket up once people are going back to cinemas in droves. Today has been a good day."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tiziana Announces Initiation of Clinical Trial in the Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) Patient with Nasal Administration of Foralumab, a Fully Human Anti-CD3 Monoclonal Antibody, Under an Individual Patient Expanded Access Program 
• The first patient with SPMS was dosed on May 24, 2021 with nasally administered Foralumab.  The treatment regimen will continue for six months to examine long-term safety, tolerability and clinical responses.
• Previous clinical studies in healthy volunteers and COVID-19 patients showed that the nasally administered Foralumab is well-tolerated with no apparent severe adverse events (SAEs) when dosed for up to 10 consecutive days. Results from these studies showed strong anti-inflammatory effects of the treatment regimen.
 
New York/London, 25 May 2021 – Tiziana Life Sciences plc (NASDAQ: TLSA, LSE: TILS) (“Tiziana” or the “Company”), a biotechnology company focused on innovative therapeutics for inflammatory diseases and cancers, is pleased to announce that the first patient with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) was dosed with nasally administered Foralumab, a fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. Nasal Foralumab 50 mcg (25 mcg/nostril) will be administered in 3-week cycles, with 3 times/week dosing for the first 2 weeks followed by 1 week of rest period. This first-ever clinical study in SPMS patients, under an Individual Patient Expanded Access IND, will continue for six months to evaluate routine safety, tolerability, and neurological behaviors. The study will also examine microglial activation, by positron emission tomography (PET), immunological and neurodegenerative markers to assess clinical responses following the treatment regimen.
Previously, Tiziana completed a Phase 1 trial of a single-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) once a day dosing for 5 consecutive days with nasally administered Foralumab in healthy subjects. The treatment was well-tolerated with no drug-related safety issues reported at doses of up to 250 mcg. (https://www.tizianalifesciences.com/news-item?s=2019-09-10-tiziana-reports-phase-1-clinical-data-demonstrating-nasal-treatment-with-foralumab-was-well-tolerated-and-produced-positive-trend-in-biomarkers-of-immunomodulation-and-anti-inflammation-in-healthy-volunteers)
Subsequently, Tiziana reported positive data from the clinical study with nasally administered Foralumab in COVID-19 patients in Brazil. Results from this clinical study demonstrated that nasally administered Foralumab at 100 mcg/day for consecutive 10 days was well-tolerated and there were no apparent severe adverse events. The clinical results demonstrated that the treatment provided significant reduction of lung inflammation together with a reduction in interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), biomarkers of inflammation, in the blood samples taken from patients ( https://www.tizianalifesciences.com/news-item?s=2021-02-02-tiziana-reports-positive-data-from-the-clinical-study-of-nasal-administration-with-foralumab-its-proprietary-fully-human-anti-cd3-monoclonal-antibody-in-covid-19-patients-in-brazil)
 
Dr. Howard Weiner, Robert Kroc Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School said, “Nasally administered anti-CD3 is an exciting, novel approach that has the ability to provide safe treatment for a form of MS that currently has no effective treatment. We are excited to examine this first-in-class approach to treat patients with SPMS for whom no effective treatment option is currently available.”
Dr. Tanuja Chitnis, Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and senior neurologist at the BWH, adds, “Effective and targeted treatments for progressive MS are urgently needed. Nasal Foralumab could revolutionize treatment for this disabling form of disease.”  
The person who arranged for the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company was Dr Kunwar Shailubhai, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer of the Company.
 
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ARTICLE 7 OF REGULATION 2014/596/EU (WHICH FORMS PART OF DOMESTIC UK LAW PURSUANT TO THE EUROPEAN UNION (WITHDRAWAL) ACT 2018) (""UK MAR"").

About Foralumab
Foralumab (formerly NI-0401), the only entirely human anti-CD3 mAb, shows reduced release of cytokines after IV administration in patients with Crohn's disease with decreases in the classic side effects of cytokine release syndrome and improves the overall safety profile of Foralumab. In a humanized mouse model (NOD/SCID IL2γc-/-), it was shown that whilst targeting the T cell receptor, orally administered Foralumab modulates immune responses of the T cells, enhances regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and thus provides therapeutic benefit in treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases without the occurrence of potential adverse events usually associated with parenteral mAb therapy (Ogura M. et al., 2017). Based on animal studies, the nasal and oral administration of Foralumab offers the potential for the immunotherapy of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in a safe manner by the induction of Tregs.
About Tiziana Life SciencesTiziana Life Sciences plc is a dual listed (NASDAQ: TLSA, UK LSE: TILS) biotechnology company that focuses on the discovery and development of novel molecules to treat human diseases in oncology, inflammation and infectious diseases. In addition to Milciclib, the Company will be shortly initiating Phase 2 studies with orally administered Foralumab for Crohn’s Disease and nasally administered Foralumab for progressive multiple sclerosis. Foralumab is the only fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (“mAb”) in clinical development in the world. This Phase 2 compound has potential application in a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn’s Disease, multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes (“T1D”), inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”), psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, where modulation of a T-cell response is desirable. The Company is accelerating development of anti-Interleukin 6 receptor (“IL6R”) mAb, a fully human monoclonal antibody for treatment of IL6-induced inflammation, especially for treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Note from Spotgamma on SPX: ""We are still watching the “void” that has formed below 4175. It would take a break of 4160, but as you can see in the EquityHub view of SPX, gamma changes quite sharply down to 4055. We interpret this sharp gamma change as “volatility fuels” and therefore anticipate a fast move to 4055 if 4160 breaks.

# TA Notes: Looking for low volatility today

* Bulls need to break 420.73 for bullish 🎯
* Bears need to break 417.75 for bearish 🎯
* Support at SMMAs
* Could see the 120 SMMA tested today so keep an eye if it doesn't hold.
* If 420.73 breaks, look for bullish 🎯 : 422.43 - 423.81 - 425.15
* If 417.25 breaks, look for bearish 🎯 : 416 - 415 - 414.13 - 412.74 - 411.26 - 410
* Please not that if we push below 415 we could see downwards pressure to 405.

2021-05-26 09:24:23,wallstreetbets,"Held myself back from buying calls at open after reading this. Just thought it would be safer to buy near an established support, which would be either 417.8 or 420.7 depending on the price action. Gotta say, your post have helped me make decisions with more confidence! Thank you a ton![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)"

2021-05-26 09:14:25,wallstreetbets,What is the 120 SMMA for SPY?
2021-05-26 09:20:51,wallstreetbets,"My 6/2c is just draining yesterday, hopefully we see the big day tomorrow"
2021-05-26 11:06:36,wallstreetbets,Bought some 419 calls. when it hit 417 LETS GO 420!!
2021-05-26 11:11:27,wallstreetbets,"I love reading your posts, you are also extremely accurate. Looks like SPY jumped off the 417.75 support, hopefully it holds rest of day. 

If you don't mind me asking are you using a terminal, purchasing market data or are you analyzing and getting the numbers on your own?"
2021-05-26 11:45:18,wallstreetbets,Do you think we may see a completion of HnS on the SPY 1 day to close 417.75ish and possibly push to bearish sentiment for end of week?
2021-05-26 11:59:51,wallstreetbets,"Using this info, what date on strikes do you usually play with?"
2021-05-26 13:41:29,wallstreetbets,Do you see this piss poor volume. Nearly 2pm and barely scratching 20 million volume
2021-05-26 12:20:40,wallstreetbets,Spy July puts
2021-05-26 09:13:03,wallstreetbets,No 0 day SPX calls for me. Hopefully if there is a downtrend it waits till Friday to reverse so I can jump in on calls

2021-05-26 11:09:35,wallstreetbets,Thoughts on memes increasing volatility?
2021-05-26 11:15:03,wallstreetbets,I love you
2021-05-26 12:12:51,wallstreetbets,"With all the data coming out tomorrow, is it pointing to bearish or bullish?"

2021-05-26 12:37:56,wallstreetbets,"I have hard time to to make profit maybe if somebody can help out. Can somebody tell me when for example price hit today 417$ range, what calls do you buy at that time, like 2 weeks out or end of week ?"

2021-05-26 17:33:36,wallstreetbets,So ummmmm...whats tomorrows lottery numbers😅😅 because you're 5/5 so far since I've followed you.
2021-05-26 18:16:27,wallstreetbets,"Spot on as usual. Sold half my 422c for a slight profit this morning. Also, I came across your FUBO post from the other day and bought the 6/28 25c, which paid out big time today. I also picked up some X 6/18 30c this morning and sa shitload of pltr 5/28 25c because I’m and idiot. Keep it up man."
2021-05-26 12:46:14,wallstreetbets,What calls did you get ?

2021-05-26 09:24:09,wallstreetbets,"on the 15m. - the yellow step line below that turquoise step line. 

If it tested 120 smma support right now it would put SPY near the bottom of the support rectangle."
2021-05-26 11:07:30,wallstreetbets,"Me too, lets get it!!!! $$$$$$$$ Spy is love, spy is life"
2021-05-26 12:47:30,wallstreetbets,what date
2021-05-26 11:14:17,wallstreetbets,spotgamma and studying ta with indicators. I also use financial juice for news. Thats about it.
2021-05-26 11:45:47,wallstreetbets,"Haha, right when I posted SPY jumps so maybe not"
2021-05-26 12:18:27,wallstreetbets,"Ill be honest with you, I'm not seeing a head and shoulders with a powerful neckline. Can you show me what you see?"

2021-05-26 09:13:30,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Might be a slow day today :)
2021-05-26 09:24:23,wallstreetbets,💕
2021-05-26 09:28:32,wallstreetbets,I'm not chimpu but I love the reference.
2021-05-26 13:40:40,wallstreetbets,I think its more of the wait and see what the numbers look like from the fed tomorrow kinda day IMO. Look out for unusual options IMO on SPY. May help indicate if someone already knows something.
2021-05-26 11:18:25,wallstreetbets,love 💕  u too bb
2021-05-26 12:20:43,wallstreetbets,"I cant predict that, If we don't close above 420.7 then ill be neutral for tomorrow. I am bullish long-term above 410. I will hedge with a VXX call  at EOD."
2021-05-26 12:35:34,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Jun OPEX is next week. I was really expecting higher volatility at the beginning of the week but it may start tomorrow and friday and carry over into next week. Another good dip buying opportunity if bullish :) My FD calls from yesterday got wrecked :)
2021-05-26 12:49:03,wallstreetbets,"If you scalp an FDs. Play an ITM and look to exit at 420. I USUALLY don't hang on to anything overnight since InFlAtIoN fEaRs.

So on that support bounce - you'd play a 417c or 418c and exit trim at 420. Sometimes I like to leave a runner if its projected to be volatile. But yesterday and today was projected as less volatility.

If youre playing a few weeks out - it depends on your sik management. I'd bullish, I'd play a 420c or 422c and look to trim at 422 and exit at 225 ish."
2021-05-26 17:55:21,wallstreetbets,Hahahahaha. If you can give me all the numbers of the last 5 years on a graph I might be able to help you! hahahah
2021-05-26 18:32:53,wallstreetbets,Glad you got that FUBO!!!!
2021-05-26 13:28:12,wallstreetbets,Today lol
2021-05-26 11:16:26,wallstreetbets,"thank you, I know what I'm going to do some research on at work today haha"
2021-05-26 13:09:14,wallstreetbets,"I was looking at the SPY 1 minute specifically from 10am to 11:45am, after further research it looks like I have no clue what an actual head and shoulders looks like and need to learn more about the neckline of the HnS.

For reference though I took a screenshot of what I'm talking about here: https://imgur.com/a/pZ1ilnu"
2021-05-26 13:46:00,wallstreetbets,"haven been this low since like feb.

2021-05-26 14:42:42,wallstreetbets,Bullish or bearish bias if we end the day under 30m?
2021-05-26 12:52:13,wallstreetbets,">So on that support bounce - you'd play a 417c or 418c and exit trim at 420.

If it is daily play only, do you play it for May.28 ? Where do you get most juice for such moves ?"
2021-05-26 14:20:19,wallstreetbets,damn man you have ballz
2021-05-26 13:10:41,wallstreetbets,Oh. Yeah. H&S are usually a month+
2021-05-26 13:48:02,wallstreetbets,Im waiting for Friday (or spy kisses 415)  to get into calls. Usually after a 3 day weekend we are green
2021-05-26 14:14:57,wallstreetbets,I'm falling asleep at my trading desk today. Its a movie watching kinda day. Today is the day I wish I still played the memes.
2021-05-26 14:55:29,wallstreetbets,I'm neutral tomorrow. Been consolidating the last two days on low volume.  Stay hedged IMO. Lots of important data coming out before market open.
2021-05-26 12:56:51,wallstreetbets,"Recommend 25k+ account for scalping IMO.

FD would be 26th. TODAY.

Tomorrow would be 28th exp."
2021-05-26 14:31:27,wallstreetbets,"I sold them for minimal gain, too choppy. Im dumb"
2021-05-26 13:51:48,wallstreetbets,Smart play! Just holding s~~trangles~~  STRADDLES rn. Waiting for volatility to pick up tomorrow and friday (hopefully). Theta beating me down today :)
2021-05-26 15:30:42,wallstreetbets,"Haha! The most winning bet I made all week was to leave my desk at 10:30am for a day trip. It’s nice to know I called at least that much. Thanks for you help... tomorrow should be exciting, though probably still low volume I would think."
2021-05-26 17:28:31,wallstreetbets,"Hedging is the weirdest place to be mentally: your either like “in the short term please go up/down—but not for too long, then do the opposite so that I can make money on both my calls and puts!” Stocks gotta be like “there is just no pleasing you, is there?”"
2021-05-26 15:04:13,wallstreetbets,Looks like we might not close above $420
2021-05-26 12:58:19,wallstreetbets,Thank you sir!
2021-05-26 14:39:42,wallstreetbets,Do you mean straddle where you buy both puts and calls?
2021-05-26 14:42:24,wallstreetbets,YESSSS. My bad. 419c 5/28 and 418p 5/28
2021-05-26 14:44:11,wallstreetbets,Will add to one of the other if support or resistance breaks. Maybe sell some puts or calls too...feeling cute

The price didn’t matter to me, worst now; because my savings account is in Gme shares. As I get more income so does my Gme/savings account.


This is to say thank you for holding at that price and to let you know I’ll be holding until it’s way above that and at your required target;I hope others remember people like you that hold at triple digit when it fell to double digit"

Short utilization at 100% (no shares to borrow) and 76% cost to borrow. What does this mean? They have doubled down in May and have not covered.

UWM also started a war with their competitor, Rocket Mortgage, because they believe Rocket was hurting the wholesale scene.

Finally, there is a lot of turnover in the wholesale mortgage industry. Underwriters are worth their weight in gold, but people won't hire them from UWM since the UWM makes the underwriting process so easy, that UWs can't make it on the outside. So UWM retains a lot of their talent.

The reason is quite simple, what do you do when  sensors contradict each other? Radar data is quite noisy and can result in f.e. phantom breaking. The camera + AI sees no obstacle, but the radar thinks there might be an obstacle which could also just be some rain. What do you do? If you choose to ignore the radar, what good is having one on there?

I’m not saying he’s correct, but this is Elon and his team saying that he thinks that their camera vision only system is/will be good enough, or even better, compared to a combined system of cameras + radar. Also, naturally, its cheaper to get rid of unnecessary components.
If they’re right (and I personally believe so), it’s quite bullish"
2021-05-26 08:15:51,wallstreetbets,Why do you think it’s concerning?
2021-05-26 13:25:56,wallstreetbets,Just how exactily do they get those lidar on the existing cars?  Will be expensive to retrofit every car.
2021-05-26 07:54:45,wallstreetbets,Idiots kill themselves in Teslas by tricking the system into thinking there is a driver. They are not meant to be driven completely driverless.
2021-05-26 07:36:40,wallstreetbets,"Didn't someone post a pic some time ago with a tesla car with lidar?  Now it appears not even radar in future...  Could this be associated with the Tesla cars sitting in the lot(s) and not put out for delivery news some time ago?  Maybe this had something to do with it, just a guess.  I'M thinking either a supply issue or a cost issue, so maybe Tesla going without now.  OMG no radar, no lidar.  Is this the future?  If radar can save some lives as radar has advantages, why take it out?"
2021-05-26 08:07:45,wallstreetbets,Teslas don't kill people. People kill people.
2021-05-26 11:05:39,wallstreetbets,"Lidar has almost all the same weaknesses as camera systems except for night, but new cameras are extremely good at that too. Lidar does not save you from rain/snow/fog, only a radar/ultrasound does.

Clearly camera + AI mapping of world & radar is the best combination. Lidar don’t matter here as much as MVIS fans think it does."
2021-05-26 12:58:25,wallstreetbets,I trust engineers more than you...
2021-05-26 10:33:02,wallstreetbets,"I think you are on the right path, I think it is because once you can have a graphics processor for all the images it has higher capability in the future. Like imagine how people drive, 2 eyes it helps with judging distance and seeing objects but most important is to identify the objects. If AI gets better in the future it will happen with image recognition and predictive actions based on those images. Radar can’t get exponentially better in the next 5-20 years while image recognition/processing can."
2021-05-26 18:10:29,wallstreetbets,"Having worked on radar systems, i can say with absolute certainly that your points are not well founded.

Rd can cut right through clutter like rain and snow. A tight beam width will give excellent resolution. It will also, and this is very important, give accurate range data. A camera with ai is fallible, because it works on assumptions, but if the ai screws up the recognition, or any other myriad problems arise with the camera/ai, there's no concrete data for it to fall back on. If there's a discrepancy between the range data showing from the radar feed vs what the ai thinks the range ought to be based on camera inputs, guess which one is right? The one with actual data showing times between signal transmission and signal reception."
2021-05-26 11:33:56,wallstreetbets,"I get phantom braking at 4 consistent locations on my weekend drive route. It's surprisingly common. They're always slight uphill grades with no obstacles or other cars. One of these days I'm gonna get rear-ended by one of our local ""no traffic tailgaters"" - the people who get right on your ass and stay there despite having 4 other lanes with no cars in them. Or I'm going to get shot because they think I brake checked them.

I just turn it off in those areas or keep my foot hovering over the accelerator now..."
2021-05-26 08:20:06,wallstreetbets,"There are reasons that all other major car manufacturers use radar, even just for adaptive cruise control.  You will no longer have any sensor fusion increasing probability for object detection - just cameras.  Elon has beeen downplaying the importance of multiple sensor types for autonomous driving and pushing the company in this direction to save cost.  After he extremely overstated the capabilities of FSD on twitter, I don't trust him to be in line with the actual engineers working on the technology."
2021-05-26 08:17:38,wallstreetbets,Because limitations don’t mean anything to stupid people
2021-05-26 16:28:07,wallstreetbets,Not my problem
2021-05-26 07:59:26,wallstreetbets,They don’t understand what autopilot means
2021-05-26 08:08:13,wallstreetbets,They use lidar for testing. It will never be in production cars. Media just gets a boner if they can put Tesla in the title.
2021-05-26 07:53:51,wallstreetbets,Lidar is the future but apparently not in Tesla cars
2021-05-26 11:09:19,wallstreetbets,"Radar is definitely better than lidar in this case, but given the choice between a system with active and passed sensors vs just passive,I'd go with the former."
2021-05-26 15:47:25,wallstreetbets,"Which engineers do you trust? The ones who say that it's better to have a radar/lidar system working in conjunction with a passive system, or the ones who say 'nah, a camera should be good enough'."
2021-05-26 08:24:09,wallstreetbets,"FSD can drive you under special circumstances from start to finish, in which way is it overrated? I speak of the FSD Beta, not the features which are available for all drivers."
2021-05-26 08:25:50,wallstreetbets,"What are the reasons for a radar system? Its not the best way only because everyone uses it.

Edit: typo (lidar->radar)"
2021-05-26 08:42:42,wallstreetbets,"Can you point out where he ""overstated"" FSD's capabilities? I'm sure you know that already but media reports always confuse Autopilot (which is merely a driver assist feature) with FSD.

Roads were built for the human eye and not radars, it makes perfect sense to rely on vision only if they're confident it is at or surpasses human level, which is already the case in state-of-the-art vision deep learning research, and for your information, Tesla got rockstars like Andrej Karpathy on their AI team. Other manufacturers can't because either they don't have the AI talent or simply don't have enough live driving data (which Tesla collects constantly with every Tesla on the road), that's why they fall back to radars. Tesla can afford to consider the data coming from radars as noise at this point.

EDIT: Shorts brigading and downvoting like cowards instead of pointing out what's wrong. Nothing surprising from haters & losers who just want Tesla to burn: https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-haters-in-germany-set-fire-to-the-power-lines-supplying-giga-berlin-investigation-is-underway . It's really sad to see WSB overtaken by the pathetic punks from TSLAQ."
2021-05-26 08:20:57,wallstreetbets,"A dumb person will do dumb stuff, it doesnt matter if the software has more features or not. So if someone tries to kill himself with a Tesla, the software cant stop him. But thats just my opinion."
2021-05-26 08:13:02,wallstreetbets,They don’t know what autopilot means so we’re excusing the fact that they still do dumb shit to bypass safety features that are meant to shut it off because it’s not a completely drive less feature?
2021-05-26 09:03:03,wallstreetbets,It’s hard to accept the truth after paying so much for the feature.
2021-05-26 10:28:59,wallstreetbets,"The future is solving vision, every single road is build to navigate with vision and every system they add on top of that are crutches to hide the fact that they can't create a proper self driving ai"
2021-05-26 11:27:40,wallstreetbets,"Oh don’t get me wrong, I would want radar too, especially since I’m in Canada. I have camera systems for basic urgent stops or keeping distance on cruise control with Subaru eyesight, they stop working during heavy snow/rain. I would not put my life on the line of automated driving in the hands of cameras. But Lidar is not the solution to this problem, they need radars. Unless some crazy breakthrough in AI image recognition is made? Ala RTX denoising for snow? Haha"
2021-05-26 17:02:33,wallstreetbets,"Without evidence to the contrary, I entrust Tesla to build the safest system they can. If they can do that with vision only, awesome."
2021-05-26 08:36:54,wallstreetbets,"Elon's comments earlier this year on twitter and to investors were overstating capabilities of FSD and out of touch with reality / his own engineers.  Here is one article about it:
https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration

He also pushed real hard for FSD Beta to be available widely and then had to walk it back.
Plus, just go look at youtube videos of people testing the FSD beta in suburban and urban areas, especially unprotected left turns where it always wants to wait during a gap and T-bone the next car or pull out directly in front of it...  not to mention the times it misunderstands speed limits or tries to drive where there is no road when it gets confused.

Elon is good at overstating shit and then hoping it plays out, but I think his luck there might be running out...  just look at how the Boring tunnel went from cool carts that zip around your car autonomously to an underwhelming and claustrophobic tunnel with trained taxi drivers."
2021-05-26 11:39:49,wallstreetbets,"I own a Tesla. He overstates it by saying it only crashes once in every x million miles. This is only true because it kicks you out before it crashes. If you put on FSD and closed your eyes, you’d crash probably once a day"
2021-05-26 08:54:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm no expert, but I'd imagine it's to help the car 'see' when visibility is impaired, such as fog or sunlight shining straight into the camera. 

The biggest problem with using 2 systems, is if 1 system says go and the other says stop, which do you trust?"
2021-05-26 08:30:29,wallstreetbets,Can't see where I mentioned lidar...
2021-05-26 08:46:43,wallstreetbets,"No, you can look at my other replies in this thread.

I frankly don't care if you don't believe me.  Just sharing my opinion."
2021-05-26 18:03:46,wallstreetbets,"I did some research not so long ago regarding near ir lidar systems, they aren't that bad but with heavy snow i could see it being a problem. A radar i think in the p band can cut through a lot of shit up to and including foliage, so definitely better in that regard. A synthetic aperture radar could also give some pretty accurate detail about any obstacle ahead."
2021-05-26 17:45:37,wallstreetbets,I can't tell if you're being serious or just dropped your /s but autopilot as a great track record of crashing into stuff. Probably because it relies on passive sensors that can give inaccurate range data for objects in front of the car.
2021-05-26 09:03:52,wallstreetbets,"So, that Elon Musk makes some bold predictions on twitter is no news, he has been doing that for years. The name of FSD is also not a good pick. Now some things you are getting false. The vision of the boring company is to make these tunnels cheap and to connect important points in a much faster way. To keep the tunnels cheap they have to be small and they are perfectly sized for Teslas cars. The driver wich is in there will not stay forever. As much as i know the traffic is controlled automatically, so no driver is needed but he is there for the good feeling of the customers. Yes there have been crashes with Teslas, and the last one in Texas is a tragic example. But this one has nothing to do with FSD or Autopilot, the news that there was no one on the drivers seat is not proven. And i am sure Autopilot was not enabled, they just drove very fast and couldnt steer fast enough. If you want to know the exact sources you can look at the Tesla daily podcasts episode on that."
2021-05-26 09:05:48,wallstreetbets,And that it gets confused when there is no road is actually very normal for a car. Because cars drive on roads 99.9% of the time.
2021-05-26 15:42:28,wallstreetbets,Thanks for this first hand information. Do you have the FSD beta or Autopilot?
2021-05-26 13:10:11,wallstreetbets,"The one that says stop 🛑
Better to safely fail"
2021-05-26 09:09:17,wallstreetbets,See that point with dust and rain but i think the engineers would say that its not possible if they wouldnt believe it. But time will tell.
2021-05-26 08:32:44,wallstreetbets,I meant radar.
2021-05-26 17:50:54,wallstreetbets,Confirmation bias... Compare autopilot to human drivers...
2021-05-26 09:43:37,wallstreetbets,"Elon doesn't predict stuff, he pushes down our throat until we eat it up. And seems like you're served."

2021-05-26 16:45:39,wallstreetbets,And get hit by the vehicle behind you?
2021-05-26 08:45:10,wallstreetbets,"Just one that comes to mind is that radar can see through road spray on a highway when it's raining and dust.  It also won't be fooled by optical illusions like light glares and shadows (anyone see the video of a Tesla randomly cutting over lanes bc the camera saw a pattern of sunlight caused by shadows that looked like lane dashes?)

Lidar, radar, cameras, ultrasonic - each sensor type has it's limitations and advantages.  Sensor fusion is the process of combining that data to get more reliable probabilities of the real world.  You don't need them all, but relying solely on cameras seems like a step backwards. 

But, ya know... do your own research:

2021-05-26 18:17:14,wallstreetbets,Absolutely 100% yes. I'm not an expert by any means lol and bullish on Tesla so if I'm wrong I want to know

https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=18472924

| On May 25, 2021, Academy reduced its term loan obligation by $99 million, leaving an outstanding principal balance of $300 million, and lowered the interest rate on the remaining balance by 125 basis points to LIBOR + 3.75%. This new rate will save the Company approximately $9 million in interest expense on an annualized basis.”

Works out to about 0.09 per share. At a 10x P/E, That should add 0.90 to the share valuation.

Always good when a company can lower debt, lower its interest rate, and improve its debt rating."
2021-05-26 07:11:44,wallstreetbets,"Very well ran company. Now is a good time to get in before earnings report on June 10th and the price is still low.

2021-05-26 08:34:13,wallstreetbets,Ouch. I don’t like the company as a consumer. I don’t think it will boom when legalization happens because of competition. It’s a very small company that might get bought out but that’s a gamble. You’d hope it will  a good company but your shares will be worth nothing when they merge. Kinda like what’s happening with FIRE (Supreme Cannabis Co) and Canopy. I’d say get out the next stop 📈.
2021-05-26 08:41:43,wallstreetbets,Hold no paper hands 🙌
2021-05-26 13:11:52,wallstreetbets,Sell and buy weeklies on something

2021-05-26 09:13:33,wallstreetbets,Sell and buy GME
2021-05-26 08:59:09,wallstreetbets,Probably the most logical advice here
2021-05-26 13:42:03,wallstreetbets,Username checks out
2021-05-26 06:23:52,wallstreetbets,This is the best advice.
2021-05-26 06:20:42,wallstreetbets,The company has had a number of large catalyst lately. Hasn’t helped a bit though.
2021-05-26 06:33:14,wallstreetbets,"$1bil in hand, $0 debt and minimum $15mil profit a quarter :) it can’t possibly ever be $0"
2021-05-26 10:48:01,wallstreetbets,"I remember that retard. 

Godspeed"
2021-05-26 11:03:56,wallstreetbets,The legend of the 4$ retard ah yes
2021-05-26 08:16:36,wallstreetbets,Hmm not sure if I understand that stock lingo.  Can you elaborate for me?
2021-05-26 08:21:30,wallstreetbets,SNDL is a Canadian pot company. The price for it to expand into US is already there.
2021-05-26 06:43:45,wallstreetbets,Honestly the only way he breaks even is if the company is still in good standing when weed becomes federally legal in the states
2021-05-26 11:35:05,wallstreetbets,Just like my BB
2021-05-26 08:11:04,wallstreetbets,Was it not up around 2 dollars a few weeks back?
2021-05-26 08:18:28,wallstreetbets,Ok $0.88
2021-05-26 13:54:32,wallstreetbets,"I can almost fully guarantee that if they are able to sell to the US they will get a good chunk of business. 

Americans pretty much all think the best weed is Canadian,  especially since there is so much cartel presence in Cali"
2021-05-26 10:44:22,wallstreetbets,but still they lag so far behind Tilray and others... I sold a few weeks ago...
2021-05-26 12:15:25,wallstreetbets,That why I have a bunch of $0.5c LEAPS for Jan 2022 and Jan 2023 because they're super cheap and might actually be profitable should the US legalize it on a federal level in the next year or 2. Pretty doubtful but YOLO.
2021-05-26 14:57:35,wallstreetbets,">Americans pretty much all think the best weed is Canadian, especially since there is so much cartel presence in Cali

nope and nope"
2021-05-26 15:38:03,wallstreetbets,"Did you read about all that ganja that SNDL grew that was turned away because of poor quality? SNDL was a RH play that WSB “apes” picked up on, and here we are with everyone saying, “but when US...”. If you want some of the market go with MSOS and enjoy the slow ride.

EVs mooning, and every single one that's up the most I don't own and the ones I do already expired worthless a week ago or are still way under water. 

Got $20k+ worth of NIO, UWMC, PLTR, AMD, AAPL, and CLOV smoking craters that need to be refilled.

BB, VIAC, SPCE, UWMC, NIO, RKT, CLOV all need to do some serious work over the next month. I unloaded my AMC position at exactly the wrong time...so no fun for me. 

Feels so damn shitty getting shaken and bled out only to miss the rebound w/ no gas left in the tank."

I plan to sell it as a highly rare, highly resistant material as a means to cover my losses from the stock market and maybe earn a profit. Bridges will be made out of foreskin beams and police units will wear foreskin vests.

I knead and squeeze and hear his appreciative groan. It spurs me on and I run my hands all over my chest and breasts, pushing them together before I start on my diamond nipples.

GME spears me with his diamond tongue but his eyes are on me, following every movement in the stock price. I push myself onto his strong tongue. His eyes crinkle at the corners, indicating a smile at my eagerness. When he flexes his tongue I pinch my diamond nipples – hard and gasp.

2021-05-26 07:03:39,wallstreetbets,"I think the really obvious indicator we'll point to if GME ever does anything especially stupid looking back is the ridiculously high floor it's held. Hasn't touched double digits in months, which could have just been MM's stabilizing for options, but let's be honest, this should've dumped ages ago if there wasn't more going on. 

I think the most recent indicator though, was price going up when 13Fs came out. Made no sense at the time, but I guess big money ended being super bullish on retail ownership. At a minimum of 20% SI and 50% institutional ownership, retail holds minimum of 50M shares. It's like TSLA on crack."

2021-05-26 07:23:10,wallstreetbets,"The problem with trying to short squeeze a stock when only 22% of float is in an active short is that billion/trillion dollar hedge funds can keep buying at the higher prices.  Say the price goes up to $400, then with that much float not in a short, then can just sell it at $400 and wait till the price collapses and burn us.  No its not my desire either, but you need to know this is a real risk.  They got tons of money to play with."

It’s only a matter of minutes before GME grabs the towel and wipes all the excess lather off me.

'There—that’s more like it,' he muses, and I finally lift my arm to look at him as he sits back to admire his handiwork.

'Happy?' I ask, my voice hoarse.  I can only think of his diamond balls filling me with his shares again.

'Very.' He grins wickedly and slowly eases a diamond finger inside of my squish mitten."" - Fifty Shades of Abe (Lincoln, 1864, p.153)"

2021-05-26 12:48:37,wallstreetbets,I have been on both sides of the trade with AMC and GME at one point or another. If these huge runs up have taught me anything it’s that at some point you need to sell and realize profits. Otherwise it turns into a loss. Of course we all wish we could sell at the all time high however that is not to be expected. A win is a win. The real goal is not to get caught without a chair when the music stops. Good luck to all and be careful out there
2021-05-26 13:39:24,wallstreetbets,"If you’re bearish on GME/AMC that’s one thing, 

but to constantly belittle people and write comments clearly fueled by animosity towards anyone who holds these stocks just screams insecurity"
2021-05-26 08:54:23,wallstreetbets,"Hourly reminder that AMC is **insanely risky** relative to GME.

AMC is currently trading at a $9000mm market cap... prepandemic levels placed this at $600mm.

AMC has had **no bullish news** for **years**.

The stock is relying *entirely on buy pressure that is detached from the company's actual value.* This **only works in tech companies, because you're investing in the technology and market ownership**.

AMC has **no room to grow in the cinema industry in the USA**. 

AMC has diluted shares from 50m to 500m... raising **billions of dollars**. They **still have debt**.

So why is GME better? Because it *doesn't need a squeeze.* It has more investors, despite what forum sliders want you to believe. It has institutional investors, because of the fundamental value proposition posed by Ryan Cohen and the team they're building.

The company has 99% market share to grow into, and an exploding technological industry to take advantage of. Theyre rapidly and radically transforming their product offerings and their delivery models.

The stock is still undervalue.

If RC had launched a startup with the same vision that Gamestop has... it would be valued *more than Gamestop currently is* at its IPO.

Gamestop has an established customer base, that is now expanding into Europe.

Wake up guys.

AMC isn't it. It never was. It never will be. They aren't working with Gamestop.

Gamestop is safe on its own strengths. It doesn't need a squeeze. It will continue to grow overtime regardless."

2021-05-26 07:19:25,wallstreetbets,Let’s burn the shorties! Incredible upside potential here!!

2021-05-26 06:26:01,wallstreetbets,"For people saying I'm crazy ,  
Well, I'm not hoping that it will be the next amazon, if the management handle to do all what you said that means 100X from it's current evaluation.  
  
This is not the next Amazon, but it's under-evaluated for what it is.   
more than 50% YoY growth (market cap 5B for 3.8B re. 1.8B + cash flow and no debts)

  
That's why average target analysts is about 24$  
  
Still they have to figure out how to get profit from the growth in RE,  
  
IF they do, it will easily be a 30B market cap.  
  
So finally, I think this is worth taking the risk, lets see in couple of months"

My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it."""

2021-05-26 14:37:14,wallstreetbets,"From hopped up retards convincing themselves that the squeeze surely, *surely* must happen soon."
2021-05-26 12:13:07,wallstreetbets,"It's probably some of the remaining short position being forced to cover in a market that's got low supply due to ETFs auto-holding and apes. While this is a squeeze, it comes with some questions.

The current short interest is something like 18% (high, but a massive decrease from earlier) and continuing to drop (hence the price increases). The critical question is: ""When do the apes own more shares than the remaining short interest?""

If we've reached a point where the apes own more, then there aren't enough forced buyers to take all ape shares. *In this situation, the apes can set the price but not all of them will be able to sell at that price.*

If this is just about screwing with the financial system or really believing GME can climb in value, that's fine. But if apes are trying to do a short-term squeeze, they'll need to recognize that they're approaching a point where selling while there are still some forced buyers is going to be a huge motivation. It's just a press-your-luck game at that point.

Obviously this isn't advice. I have no idea how many shares apes actually own and didn't look at the impact that calls might have. I'm just pointing out that the apes' exit strategy is no longer as simple as ""there are guaranteed buyers for all of us"" like it was earlier this year."

They can hold on a lot longer than any retail investor. At this point if you're still holding GME or AMC, you should really consider buying some puts to hedge against price drops."

Short - essentially means sell
Long - means buy
Put - the right to sell a stock at a given price 
Call - the right to buy a stock at a given price
So if you are long call on a stock you have the right to buy that stock at a given price, ie if price goes up you win.
If you short a call position you have essentially sold to someone the right to buy the stock (from you), ie price goes up you lose. 
With all 4 positions you can gain/win either buy the actual cost of buying/selling the option contract itself OR by exercising the option and buying/selling the stock itself"

2021-05-26 12:14:44,wallstreetbets,"And he explained it wrong too.

Call means you're ""call""ing the peak and think stock is gonna fall

Put means you're ""put""ting all your money behind the stock because it's gonna go up"
2021-05-26 12:36:03,wallstreetbets,Leave the sub
2021-05-26 13:40:54,wallstreetbets,"From what I understand.

Calls are you purchasing the option to buy at a guaranteed price.

Puts are you purchasing the option to sell at a guaranteed price.

So if you have a call option for gme at 250 and it goes to 300. You can buy at 250 and sell at 300.

If you have a put option at 250 and it goes to 200, you can buy at 200 and sell at 250.

Just keep in mind you have to pay a price to have that option. So depending how much the stock moves and in which direction you might not gain as much as you thought, if anything."
2021-05-26 17:19:22,wallstreetbets,I also get all my knowledge from internet memes.  It's the best way to learn!
2021-05-26 18:13:24,wallstreetbets,"edit for clarity: ""so basically when you buy a call you bet the stock will go up and when you buy a put you bet the stock will go down.""  

You can also sell a call and pocket the ante (premium), betting the stock won't go up very much.  And yes, you can also sell a put (pocket the premium), betting the stock won't go down very much."

2) Pick any scenario with a binary outcome. (e.g. a: TSLA will go up or b: TSLA will go down)

3) Tell half your guys that Outcome A will happen, tell the other half it's B for sure.

4) Discard the losing half of contacts, keep the by-now-more-faithful half.

2021-05-26 18:47:03,wallstreetbets,"No, puts are options that you can buy on a stock. Usually, when a stock's price is high, people buy puts to hedge against the possibility of the stock price to drop. So say you buy a GME put for a strike price of $200 expiring next Friday. That means whoever sold you the put is required to buy GME shares from you for $200 at any point from now until next Friday. If GME's share price remains above $200, then the put you bought is worthless because it wouldn't make sense for you to exercise it. However, if GME's share price drops to, say, $170 by next Friday, you can exercise your put and sell your shares for $200. There are a number of variables and factors that determine the price of the put option, so it may not always be profitable even if the strike price is higher than the share price. It's basically like paying for an insurance policy. If you're new to options though, you should definitely understand what they're about before buying any. It's very, VERY easy to lose money on options."

If you do it anyway even knowing this, you’re willingly getting f*cked in the @ss. And if you’re willingly getting f*cked in the @ss, you probably like it.  That’s why the trade is a F@ggot’s Delight.  It’s an FD."

However I do not buy your premise at all. Catastrophes like pandemics and market corrections really don't affect the wealthiest peoples day to day lives, and at ticket prices anywhere from $200,000 to $400,000 for a couple hours experience who is Branson target audience?

If Travis Barker, Joe Rogan, Neil Degrasse Tyson, or Bill Ney the Science Guy want to go to fucking space; the tail end of a pandemic and a market correction are going to be totally irrelevant. The real limitation is Virgin's abilities to actually be able to do it, but once Branson goes the real limiting factor will be their turn around ability of how often they can do the flights, and mechanical repairs required.

Also even if your point WAS valid, they ALREADY have 600 tickets sold and have a huge waiting list. SO even if the pandemic worsens and a Q3 or Q4 market correction took place, they already have their first 600 passengers ready to go. Ideally their goal is 400 flights a year, and at the very start of the project that is obviously going to be a much slower, turn around. So its not a stretch to assume that is 2 years of passengers already paid and agreed to go, decisions have been made, market forces or pandemics be damned.

I agree between now and the announcement of the Branson flight, their price will decrease gradually from where it is now. But the minute Branson's confirmed to fly, (Q4 I think) as long as there aren't any accidents this rocket will at minimum 3x and not come back for a long time."

2021-05-26 13:35:24,wallstreetbets,"I think white (not Hispanic) men are similar in height to black men in the US. Both are taller on average than Latinos, by a significant margin if the Latin guy is an immigrant due to suboptimal average nutrition in the poorer Latin countries. I believe Asian men lie somewhere in between regarding height, unless they are immigrants from poorer SE Asian or Pacific Islands, who would typically be shorter due to their early life nutrition.

There is actually slight variation based on latitude, and conceivably average latitude of ancestral lineage. One might hypothesize that colder climates allow for larger people given the easier dissipation of heat (temperature gradient) and maintenance of core temperature (thickness of insulation/physical distance from biological core to external environment).

Scandinavian countries are the best examples of this. The average height of a Swedish male is like 5’11”.

I actually find the relationship between geography, biology, and culture fascinating. In this time of great debate about race and culture, no one discusses the effect of average ancestral geography and its effects.

If you’ve been to equatorial regions, you know it’s warm year round. Thus, there is no need to “plan for the winter.” It’s also miserably hot during the middle of the day in the summer. Thus, there is a long break from work called a “siesta”. In northern regions, there are no reliable food sources in the winter and the summers are mild. Thus they plan for the winter and work all day in the warm months in preparation. These sorts of things are central to culture and not necessarily related to underlying biology in any way. They can be passed to subsequent generations outside the original geography.

The discussion of “whiteness” and “blackness” touches on such things and ties it to race/biology, which I think is not only wrong, but harmful and backwards.

A similar thing may be seen as to have occurred with sprinters and distance runners. Sprinting and running are of little use in snow. On the other hand, if one is hunting or fighting year round on dirt and grass, then speed makes a difference in marginal success rates. Thus over generations, speed will be selected for over weight/height. 

Cleverness and overall intelligence remain important no matter the climate/geography as it is humanity’s greatest weapon. *Long term planning* though, may show a marginal overdevelopment in colder, harsher climates. It is possible such differences forced their ways into our biology. I am not convinced of such a phenomenon, but I do consider it possible.

Such things are perfectly obvious if you look at non-human higher animals. Consider the difference between a grizzly/polar bear and a lion/cheetah."

Unless they're a hell of good time and impress me enough to want to be friends with them in the short interaction. Often that isn't the case.

I disagree I don't think you can just vet someone's intelligence in a single conversation. You would probably have to discuss multiple topics over a long period of time before even getting a small idea of how smart someone is. Perhaps over a meal or some other activity. If only there were a name for such an event."

Should they be though? I'm not denying that people treat each other this way, but I don't know if I could agree that it's right to approach someone with only personal needs in mind.

People can be receptive to something under false pretense. People manage getting free dinners by going on dates and creating illusion that they're on the same page with their date while using them as nothing but a means to satisfy their needs."

2021-05-26 12:59:05,wallstreetbets,"The point of ""shooting your shot"" in an attempt to get laid like this is to find someone else who is interested in the same thing: meeting sexual needs in a casual way. Obviously if they're not looking for that, you should move on.

First you said you don't like the expression because it reduces the interaction to something dehumanizing, and that to go about trying to get laid, you should talk to people like they're actual people. But then you said you shouldn't approach someone under false pretenses if you're just trying to get laid.

Which is it: being straightforward and honest about your intentions is dehumanizing, or having a real conversation when you only want sex is misleading? Can't have it both ways... seems like you just want people to not want casual sex, and that's not gonna happen"
2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What do you guys think of GME??!! Up or down in 24hrs?!! GME stock's most recent quarterly report didn't inspire much confidence, either. The company reported 5.5% higher fourth-quarter profit of $1.34 a share. That missed forecasts by nearly 6%. Meanwhile, revenue sank 3% during the quarter to $2.1 billion. The top line fell short of estimates by 5%.

And it's not just a case of a tough quarter. The company's EPS growth rate started declining consistently in 2017 and turned into outright losses for fiscal 2021, which ended in January. Meanwhile, GME stock's sales posted an 18% annualized drop in the past three years.

Interestingly, GME stock's consumer electronics retail group is doing well. It's ranked 8th out of 197 groups, says [**IBD's Stock Checkup**](https://research.investors.com/stock-checkup/nyse-gamestop-corp-gme.aspx). But GME stock's quarter was a disappointment.

If your share holdings are not a multiple of five, say 213 shares, you will get 42 reverse adjusted shares and a cash payout for the 3 remaining pre-split shares."

2021-05-26 06:57:05,wallstreetbets,"Except this has existed countless times before in the industry and while various different platforms have niches and enough to survive and continue to be profitable, they do not to grow.

Every time this kind of thing comes up people think it's new and innovative and going to change the industry. This happens because every single other time it's happened it has been a hot thing for 5-7 years followed by a drop out of public awareness and sunsetting into a stable and profitable platform but a stagnant one. The fact you're under the impression roblox is new despite it not being anything unique and new is exactly the point here. Roblox will be the same. 

Roblox for example targets a niche demographic and functions as essentially an interface and platform for people to make their own creations that can be run in instanced ways. No matter how innovative the ""game"" created on the platform, these ""games"" will always be constrained by the limits of the platform. As a result any ""game"" that becomes successful enough and is growing will depart the platform to become its own standalone title, for example unturned. Eventually, just like every other time this has existed, the advancement of technology which cannot easily be implemented into existing infrastructure and the platform becomes its undoing, because people see a ""dated"" engine and compare it to what they think of games as without understanding what they're looking at, which in turn causes a drop in new users. 

Thats the main issue here. Platforms such as Linden Lab's Second Life does and has everything Roblox has, while also doing far far more and has true persistence as an internet of virtual spaces in a true sense rather than instances of creations you load or join. Second Life also has a thriving creator economy and virtual real estate turning over thousands of dollars per day for creators. Second Life on top of this targets all demographics by being a web protocol rather than a platform for content. 

Despite all of this, Second Life remains neutral in its growth and even slightly negative in growth and while profitable sees little to no growth. 

Eventually Roblox will be the same and then something else trying this ""new and innovative"" idea will come along and be praised as the first of its kind, yet again, and the cycle will continue, yet again. This will continue to be the case until the original concept for the metaverse from IBM actually happens and until then platforms like this won't die but they won't be the game changer you think they are. 

So if competitors to Roblox are doing more than roblox and despite this are not seeing growth in value, how is roblox going to be different despite doing less and targeting an even smaller demographic?

I'm not saying these platforms don't gave a place. They absolutely do and they are important to computer science and our connected society. There is a bright future for this kind of technology and a true platform like the metaverse in the futute. But if you're looking at a bull thesis here on these areas while one may come along at some point, it's certainly not going to be roblox."
2021-05-26 09:49:01,wallstreetbets,Roblox is still a game no matter how you swing it. This concept has even existed in basically the same capacity for many years previously. Minecraft has provided a similar niche for years except they’re an ethical company who shot down micro-transactional services before they swallowed the platform. It’s still run on a game engine that will become outdated over time. Developers still need to continue to work on their creations in what is effectively a sub-platformed fashion for many years to come. The time horizon of a decade is not favorable to something like this. It will be a constant game of catch up.
2021-05-26 09:44:30,wallstreetbets,"What’s your time horizon though? I’m not sure you understand. They will have to update the core game engine within the next decade for this to remain successful. Independent developers will need to remain actively developing on a sub-platform. I’m not talking weeks or months I’m talking years. It doesn’t matter how good the framework is now, they need this to be up-to-scratch for many years running. The possibility of disruption is massive."

2021-05-26 08:17:28,wallstreetbets,"Kids play Roblox and are relatively recession proof, it's a safer bet than the adult spend and it doesn'tneed to be more advanced than it is. That said it does seem overvalued to me."
2021-05-26 10:51:14,wallstreetbets,"I don't have any thoughts on Roblox as an IPO, but for staying up to date, Roblox has successfully, and drastically updated their engine I'd say 6 or 7 times now over 16 years, and have rolled out thousands of other updates, and continue to do hundreds a year. It's an interesting situation for the developers of games though, they have to play catch up constantly, usually a little tweeking will suffice as Roblox devs make constant small reworkings, but not everyone can keep coming back every few days just to make sure their game works as intended, and it's even harder every couple months as medium sized ones happen. The trend is that these developers do actually spend years keeping their games up to date, but what's interesting is that games from 2005 and later where their creators quit, died, or something else, their games can be stolen and updated indefinitely, there almost nothing stopping someone from taking other peoples ""places"" as Roblox calls them, so popular games don't actually ever die, they just get made again and again by ambitious creators which there has never been a shortage of. 

I don't think their problem will actually be updating their platform, that is something they have historically been very anal about, and are still anal about making sure they roll out changes very frequently. Users' reaction from these updates hasn't ever had a high amount of backlash because the creators just keep updating their games so they don't really feel much until the major ones come out. The incentive for creators on Roblox is that they can trade an ingame currency for real money, which is another reason why they stay, and why there is very stiff competition to remain popular."
2021-05-26 19:16:44,wallstreetbets,"If we’re talking like 10 years out, probably. The thing is, that momentum will die when it dies. Roblox isnt going anywhere anytime soon, but I wouldn’t treat this as Apple either."

2021-05-26 12:25:02,wallstreetbets,Just fine at the moment.
2021-05-26 08:46:30,wallstreetbets,"I totally agree, but again the point is this is not new. It has existed before.

Roblox will \*not\* fail, but it is \*not\* going to be an avenue for future growth.

The concept is sound, but for context Roblox is far less developed and is far narrower in scope than other things that have done this, and they remain profitable but stagnant. Roblox is not going to buck this trend by doing less, while keeping the same limitations.

For a comparison, Roblox is essentially ""Youtube Kids"" in metaverse. We don't consider YouTube Kids something new and innovative, just like Roblox isn't.

Likewise, Youtube has content that targets younger demographics, as does Youtube Kids. But YouTube Kids is \*only\* that demographic.

Roblox will be profitable, what it will not be is a growth stock. However, this is a concept that \*will\* be a growth stock from something else that tries this, without the hamstringing Roblox has put on itself.

As mentioned, the problem that exists with these platforms is they are based on their foundation codebase and engine tech and firmly stuck to it. Any porting to future engines either is limited by partial implementation to preserve legacy content, or a total abandonment of legacy content which leads to user disenfranchisement."
2021-05-26 11:02:09,wallstreetbets,"The system is arguably analogous to Garry’s Mod in my eyes, but even with micro-transactions I don’t think GMod could IPO. Sure these are kid-centered games at their core, but how do you maintain integrity of the core structure like this? It seems to me like it is far too wild-west to guarantee the type of financial stability that we are being advertised."
2021-05-26 12:30:24,wallstreetbets,Good for you. Buy again when it corrects back to $78.
2021-05-26 12:43:54,wallstreetbets,If you don't care that's fine. I don't really care either. Was just a late night snarky comment because I happened to see your username on both. ✌️
2021-05-26 11:13:22,wallstreetbets,I think you’re forgetting the main part: targeting kids. Not teens or young adults. Kids are stupid. They don’t think about great gaming performance. They just want to play simple games that all the other kids in their age group are playing.
2021-05-26 11:27:55,wallstreetbets,"Well there's more than games, Roblox has it's own economy, which includes limited items whether it be gear, or clothing, some of which is worth tens of thousands dollars, there's groups which have created very strong communities on the platform, both of which are run by their in-game currency. But what do you mean by ""maintain integrity of the core structure like this?"" In reference to their economy, they maintain that through the creator partnership program they have, millions of their currency is taken out to combat inflation and is exchanged for real money, but if you are referencing something else please let me know. It is very wild west, there's not much regulation on places, In-game currency is used to buy anything from groups, items, but especially in game microtransactions, there are usually at least 5 for every game with over a 100 players and I'd say the average cost is about 5$-10$ per game, so most people opt for their subscription service instead. Their age base is also typically 5-18, there's a lot of kids, but these older creators and users are very much financially a part of Roblox"

2021-05-26 11:36:12,wallstreetbets,I mean in terms of maintaining the core structural elements that provide the foundation for gameplay. I see it as a fragile ecosystem with little to no oversight.
2021-05-26 11:25:34,wallstreetbets,You can’t compare miniclip to roblox. I’ve never even heard of mini clips before
2021-05-26 12:00:37,wallstreetbets,"Well their engine and code is their foundation for their platform, and that's what I was saying earlier, they update it constantly, and they don't release updates that would actually harm it. When I say ""creator"" I mean the independent people on that platform that make the games, the devs references Roblox. Roblox owns all of their own code, and their own engine, that's protected proprietary information. The creators get to use their code, but in no way is their code or engine an ecosystem, or fragile. But if you mean the creators, it isn't fragile really at all, creators have and are still very good at maintaining their games, and when they aren't, which isn't very common, their games die and someone else makes them again, or get taken over and the users aren't any the wiser"
2021-05-26 11:33:59,wallstreetbets,Flash games in general
2021-05-26 12:06:34,wallstreetbets,"What I really mean is the sort of abstract system they have created. This is what you’re addressing when you talk about the creators. What I take issue with is the fact that Roblox itself provides very little relative to what outside creators provide. If the incentive for outside creators to continue to create is gone, so is the whole platform. This is what I view as being the central fragility of Roblox in general."
2021-05-26 11:36:06,wallstreetbets,Yea there’s your problem. Flash.
2021-05-26 12:16:37,wallstreetbets,"Ah, I understand, the dev partnership program allows creators to exchange their Robux for actual money, a popular game on roblox can net their creators tens of thousands of dollars, and hundreds of thousands to millions for their top games. It isn't a lot, but it's definitely enough to create an oversupply of willing creators"
2021-05-26 11:37:25,wallstreetbets,Right but it’s not as if those sites couldn’t have existed in some capacity as time went on without flash.
2021-05-26 12:39:52,wallstreetbets,"I wrote out a big comment that got deleted when my app crashed but the gist of my concerns come from the fact that a) Roblox Corp. has effectively developed an open market interface for children, b) that they are at the will of the suppliers to such an interface, and c) are effectively highly leveraged on the fact that there is no regulatory oversight for such a technology. From a business perspective I view this as a bit beyond the pale ethically speaking and the chance for someone to see it similarly is massive. I feel they have little control over the ecosystem they have created and are at the will of individuals they similarly do not control. To me, investing in RBLX is like investing in a slightly less outright terrifying Jurassic Park."

2021-05-26 03:52:30,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Sold out of a few other positions and threw everything at it the last few months. Kinda Figured if this is a once in a lifetime thing I wanted to be ready. Only regret is I didnt figure out a way to buy more when they were around $10 🤣 kicking myself now but I dont wanna ruin my avg. In case they keep dragging this out as I have to say this s*** is getting crazy.

2021-05-26 02:46:07,wallstreetbets,"You can leverage what you’re making by selling calls (meaning you want the price to go up)

You have the ability right now a leverage those 1100 shares by selling up to 11 calls options


Or convert some of your holdings into long term call options.


The $12 Jan 20 2023 call, is going for $8.85 a contract. You could buy that since it has respect that level recently well. (The price will be diff in the opening but you could leverage that’s way if you think amc go higher but a great amount). This is just my thoughts"
2021-05-26 18:48:22,wallstreetbets,I owned 1000 shares of amc @ $3 ish average at the same time as 150 GME for 13ish average. Sold amc for a loss and made like $750 on GME. I knew nothing of WSB at the time. If only... I’d be sitting on a nice chunk of money right now. GUH!
2021-05-26 04:19:24,wallstreetbets,Not looking likely to drop back down to the 10’s anytime soon but if it does suddenly I have an order set for 4000 shares 😂

2021-05-26 02:01:49,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately I sold 3 covered calls at a strike of $18 today.  Some lucky bastard is printing my tendies on Friday.

2021-05-26 16:28:25,wallstreetbets,I will sell if it dips to $18.
2021-05-26 11:00:54,wallstreetbets,"It’s a squeeze. Very Unpredictable. If GME peaked at 350-400, maybe 100-150. Honestly it depends on the flow. When it goes, it’ll go. If there’s momentum it won’t slowdown and it’ll keep going. But if a big holder drops it all and cuts their profits, it’ll dip hard"
2021-05-26 14:17:56,wallstreetbets,Thank for you share i wild hold them for you too 100$
2021-05-26 10:40:49,wallstreetbets,"Well. I've never been in the money so don't take my advice. But if the stock has wind behind it and it looks like it's on a big upswing hold it until closer but if it looks like nothing good is happening sell off and don't risk it.
Also depends on your financial situation"
2021-05-26 09:39:21,wallstreetbets,Apeish ;)
2021-05-26 11:30:25,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry, it is over 19 already!"

2021-05-26 10:20:31,wallstreetbets,We must have met in our dreams bud. Just the other day I had a dream that I was reaching over tens of thousands  in GME and AMC.
2021-05-26 02:38:10,wallstreetbets,After I came ....I called it AMC
2021-05-26 11:39:01,wallstreetbets,what are your guesses based on?
2021-05-26 13:36:42,wallstreetbets,Fud
2021-05-26 10:30:17,wallstreetbets,truer words have never been spoken
2021-05-26 12:24:47,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-26 07:01:02,wallstreetbets,I feel like you are somehow missing the point of the stock market.
2021-05-26 11:07:14,wallstreetbets,dis da wey

2021-05-26 10:50:01,wallstreetbets,"Lol same here, bought during the same peak as you…"
2021-05-26 07:39:46,wallstreetbets,I was just gonna buy at market at opening.  I’m totally new at this so any “suggestions” would be awesome!
2021-05-26 07:55:29,wallstreetbets,That’s great advice!  Thanks so much.  What is a good site to watch volume? I was looking at tradingview but I don’t like the layout.
2021-05-26 02:03:15,wallstreetbets,Dude same fucking here I feel retarted only made like $100 profit I shoulda hold but hopefully tomorrow it goes up and we can print another day
2021-05-26 04:22:16,wallstreetbets,"Dude, if you bought at 9 you made at least $2700+ premium. No shame in that!"
2021-05-26 03:09:54,wallstreetbets,Hahahaah
2021-05-26 02:37:08,wallstreetbets,We heard you u ape
2021-05-26 10:39:48,wallstreetbets,Do you tho? Because when they dump off a little profit itll hold you back. But guess time will tell. I just find it funny how while its rising people come in all of sudden talking bout their diamond hands and ape this and that. If it pulled back to 12 right now.....who u think gonna be dumping first lol. Either way...hold the line!
2021-05-26 08:27:12,wallstreetbets,Dude. Im a regular guy i don't have hundreds of thousands of dollars like the popular posts here. But I'll hld on for now.
2021-05-26 12:36:04,wallstreetbets,Beautiful 👌
2021-05-26 17:56:07,wallstreetbets,You think AMC Will hit 100?  It never hit over 35 in past 5 years?
2021-05-26 10:50:50,wallstreetbets,But is there a financial gain to hold closer to Friday To buy OR just Buy them now?
2021-05-26 11:34:15,wallstreetbets,"Haha, imagine buying at the day time high, and being profitable the next day. Incredible!! God I love AMC so much."

2021-05-26 11:31:53,wallstreetbets,the ice age!
2021-05-26 07:01:52,wallstreetbets,Did they all buy AMC at 17.08?
2021-05-26 11:43:35,wallstreetbets,SAME plz pick up the BB boys after the squeezes
2021-05-26 07:48:58,wallstreetbets,"I would not buy when market opens with a market order. Not sure if you able to see the pre-market activity but AMC closed yesterday at $16.41 and as we speak trading around $17.69 and should climb higher before opening bell. Have patience to buy when you see a large sell off and the price will make a dip. Look at the large volume of shares placed to sell and look for large volume of shares at higher prices. I’m a dumbass with a hope and a pray with AMC going above $20. Not looking to get rich, would like to but highly unlikely. Best of luck"
2021-05-26 07:58:42,wallstreetbets,I use Fidelity. nasdaq.com shows live pre-market trades and share volume and per price and time.
2021-05-26 04:56:46,wallstreetbets,a small profit is a thousand times better than a loss
2021-05-26 02:10:18,wallstreetbets,Any trade that doesn't bankrupt you is a good trade my dude
2021-05-26 02:36:04,wallstreetbets,"Buddy, I sold a $20 strike covered call for $25. I have conflicted feelings about where the price goes. Might buy to close and eat the $50-100 loss"
2021-05-26 09:14:48,wallstreetbets,WELL NOT WITH THAT ATTITUDE!
2021-05-26 17:03:09,wallstreetbets,"There’s no financial gain to hold until Friday if you think the price will stay steady where it’s at, because the theta will decay on your itm options and u will lose money every day, if you think it will shoot up hold, if you think it will stay the same or go down then sell"
2021-05-26 12:23:54,wallstreetbets,What's it feel like to experience that feeling every day for 100 days?  Let's find out!  DIAMOND HANDS!
2021-05-26 10:18:53,wallstreetbets,😊
2021-05-26 08:01:24,wallstreetbets,Awesome! Thanks again
2021-05-26 10:08:16,wallstreetbets,"I'm gonna keep telling myself that all day today while watching the price action. I set a trailing stop & it went off, locking me into a modest profit for my investment. 

Now this massive green hulk dick shows up. 

Maybe I'll buy a T-shirt about having turned a profit on a meme stock. LOTS of people are going to be posting an L or at the least, opening a position that goes underwater for a long time."
2021-05-26 02:11:21,wallstreetbets,I think I will yolo $200-$300 worth of calls for amc tomorrow at open
2021-05-26 02:37:41,wallstreetbets,Will you buy a $18 call tomorrow at open? Or time it out and see if it will dump like always
2021-05-26 10:50:58,wallstreetbets,Regular guy here too. Up $200+ just let it fly. What’s a $100?
2021-05-26 13:01:15,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha, it's how I've felt since January! but seeing someone come in one day and the next being in the green. Makes my grinchy heart 4 times the size Greg's turkey neck."
2021-05-26 03:10:11,wallstreetbets,Shares not calls
2021-05-26 02:41:04,wallstreetbets,"If I understand correctly, I have to buy a $20 call to close the $20 call I sold."
2021-05-26 03:11:04,wallstreetbets,We don’t like your kind around here
2021-05-26 04:59:46,wallstreetbets,thats right but why not just let the calls exercise (if they close ITM) and take the profit on the share sale + the option premium
2021-05-26 02:42:26,wallstreetbets,So you definitely believe it will hit 25 I’m assuming
2021-05-26 06:36:55,wallstreetbets,Just roll it up and out a week
2021-05-26 08:23:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I have some 15 calls anyway that I can exereif I really want those shares back. It's just I had a 7.xx average and I kinda wanted to keep it. But the premium is dick, I consider it a $25 fee for graduating from basic call options"
2021-05-26 02:50:35,wallstreetbets,Also I have a handful of calls throughout the next month that are all in the green. Could I use one of these to close instead of giving shares or buying a new contract?
2021-05-26 08:27:35,wallstreetbets,"For the life of me, I can't make complete sense of the whole rolling thing. Am I wrong to say it's essentially buying to close, ie eating the loss, and then selling to open a new covered call?

Also I have a few 15 strikes, can I use them to roll? Worst case if the buyer exercises, I will exercise a 15 and spend the 500 left over on more options lol maybe gme this time. Or make the whole 2k on gme"
2021-05-26 02:52:41,wallstreetbets,I don’t want to ruin your life so I will not give advice haha
2021-05-26 02:53:11,wallstreetbets,All I can say is I hope the $18 call for tomorrow is a win and not a $300 loss like I did with gme
2021-05-26 08:30:17,wallstreetbets,"Rolling is basically pushing the can down the road. Since time has value, you can roll your strike out (15 strike > 17 strike) and over another week. It'll be roughly the same premium gained/loss but you have an extra week to see if AMC comes back down."
2021-05-26 02:56:11,wallstreetbets,"If the past few weeks are any indication, it can hit 18 in the first hour.

Normally it would start its decent by 11am tomorrow to close Friday. But now I have no clue."
2021-05-26 08:20:58,wallstreetbets,"Hope your watching premarket, first 15 are gonna be crazy for options so get ready"
2021-05-26 08:41:19,wallstreetbets,"Right but what's the process? Like how would I do it at this point, I'm on TDA"
2021-05-26 03:08:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah it’s like a fucking gamble smh but I think tomorrow / today will be another win I’m not sure about Thursday
2021-05-26 08:41:44,wallstreetbets,"On TDA no idea, I know on fidelity there is a roll option."
2021-05-26 03:10:36,wallstreetbets,No doubt. I think there's enough momentum to eat the first few sell walls in the morning
2021-05-26 08:43:18,wallstreetbets,"Is that a special buy type or basically a shortcut, cuz I saw some videos and they were doing what I explained but I'm still eating the cost whether I roll or just close"
2021-05-26 03:12:17,wallstreetbets,Definitely going to call and sell the same day I don’t think I have the balls to hold until Thursday or Friday. Robinhood always find a way to fuck shit up cause stock to go down
2021-05-26 09:02:52,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure its just two orders simulatenous. Buy to close a contract at 15 strike May 28c and sell to open a 17 strike June 4th call.
2021-05-26 03:19:33,wallstreetbets,Here's to both our options working out!
2021-05-26 09:54:34,wallstreetbets,"See this is what I don't get. Why buy to close a $15 strike when the covered call is $20 strike? And I assume the new sell to open doesn't matter what strike is, as long as I'm happy with the premium?

Also are you mixing my $15 regular call options that are all ITM with the $20 covered call that I now regret selling and am trying to roll?"
2021-05-26 03:25:51,wallstreetbets,Cheers

Paper hands 🖐️📜🤚 wisen up, They only make you believe what they want you believe. Listen to me I've only predicted what they wanted not what you wanted. But listening to me you'll make them rich not you make yourself rich. Think about what I say, two steps ahead is always better than one..."
2021-05-26 06:57:05,wallstreetbets,What does this mean?
2021-05-26 08:25:44,wallstreetbets,I believe its the inverse of people who were buying 800 calls.

2021-05-26 01:28:38,wallstreetbets,"My guess is because you buy cheap deep OTM calls which have a low probability of profit and are extremely sensitive to IV crush.  


If you buy deep ITM options, you get better leverage on your money and have less exposure. There is obviously less upside if the stock moons (compared to OTM options), but 40 $8 calls expiring in Dec were trading around $7.50 when you bought those shares, which would have cost you \~30k. If AMC drops below $8, you lose all intrinsic value. However your downside is capped at 30k. With the shares, you put up front an additional 30k in capital, get the same sort of profit profile, and if AMC drops below $8, you lose more than 30k.

Food for thought. You don't have to Yolo FDs as your only option strategy."

2021-05-26 13:27:57,wallstreetbets,"IV is sky high right now so I would recommend selling the long calls you currently have and writing 40 of the 6/4 $22C covered calls. Collect $8K+ instantly in premium in addition to the profit on your long calls and if the covered calls you wrote print, you also cash in a 20% profit on your underlying shares from the current price point. Regardless, you keep that $8K-10K in premium from writing those covereds. Good luck"

2021-05-26 14:12:57,wallstreetbets,"The risk of selling the covered calls is that you have to hold the shares until the date the covered calls expire OR until you choose to buy the calls you wrote back. But what’s guaranteed about selling covered calls is that you keep the premium from selling the calls no matter what, in this case a lot of fucking money. Selling covered calls is less risky than just holding the shares outright, and you’re just obligated to hold the shares until either of the above conditions are met"

And with theta decay, you’ll profit faster on the 6/4 calls as the IV/realm of possible share price movement drops faster the closer it gets to expiration.

2021-05-26 12:00:25,wallstreetbets,Yep people have posted their Fidelity letters here.  They call you an idiot in a most professional manner when you realize a significant loss.
2021-05-26 10:23:57,wallstreetbets,"This is not solid advice. The buying pressure is too much for a flash crash. Plus he's not trying to give objective information, he is in the gme camp and is one of those people who doesn't want to see AMC succeed because he feels like it's taking money away from him. 

He's stating a flash crash is a fact that will happen for sure. Last week he was posting that there was no way AMC would go up because they can't gather 450 million shares (was when the price was at $12) 

He said his point and people have upvoted the originaln comment, then he wrote three other posts about a flash crash so people downvoted his obvious FUD."
2021-05-26 05:27:15,wallstreetbets,You might be able to sell the 15 and 16 today if the IV is high enough. You could still pick up the 28 dollar strike call for 6/25 relatively cheap. But the 11a through 13’s might be dead. Just my 2 cents.
2021-05-26 15:26:37,wallstreetbets,"Alright I'll write up the 4 possible decisions you can make here while AMC is still mooning and we still have 40 minutes left til the bell rings. Every move outside of this list is either ineffective or just not profitable. These options are listed from lowest risk -> highest risk

1) Sell your long calls and your shares and realize your gains. You YOLO'd a shit ton of money and lived to tell the tale, spend some of the gains on yourself to celly and move on to the next play. Recommend keeping $10K for long calls/long puts, $20K in holding VTI or some standard index ETF, the rest in individual shares

2) Sell your long calls and write covered calls on your shares. Contrary to what you would believe from this subreddit, getting a 3x or higher on long calls is rare, and at any time, especially in a highly volatile stock like AMC, you can forfeit all your gains on them with one bad trading day. With writing 15-20% OTM calls, you not only cash in on high IV and collect a nice $10K paycheck, but also leave the potential to profit an extra 15-20% on your shares while only having the obligation to hold them for another 1-3 weeks

3) Hold your long calls and shares, but set a stop loss. With this option you're not capping your potential upside and also you get to sleep with the peace of mind that no matter what, you still come out ahead on this YOLO. The worst case scenario here is that AMC gaps down before the next trading day, triggering your stop loss below the limit you set it at

4) Hold your long calls and shares, no stop loss. You are comfortable putting $80K+ on a roulette table with no insurance. Best of luck here


With keeping the long calls and writing covered calls, I'm not sure if that option is available for my brokerage personally to have both of those positions at the same time, but I'd say it's option 2.5 here. Kind of a half assed strategy that doesn't negate the risk of the long calls while capping your potential upside on the shares"
2021-05-26 10:58:41,wallstreetbets,?
2021-05-26 15:33:20,wallstreetbets,I just did option 2. Better safe than sorry. What happens if AMC tanks to $15 on expiration? I’m stuck with the shares but I would keep the premium. Damn do I really want to be stuck with these shares.
2021-05-26 15:36:02,wallstreetbets,"Your losses are mitigated by the premium you collected from the covered calls and you come out ahead overall from selling the long calls at the top. You can buy back the covereds you sold at anytime and sell the shares, you just have to give back some or all of the premium you collected to do so, depending on the call price when you want to buy to close"
2021-05-26 16:36:23,wallstreetbets,You are a smart ape. I want to befriend you ape friend. You think more and better than I do.

Went with option 4 and ended up walking away with only $12K in profits from SQ and $9K in losses from FDX, so I felt like I was talking to myself in the past. I hope your covered calls get assigned and you get your max profit!"

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"yet one more (very short and crude) $GME DD tl;dr - $GME is still very cheap. Even if, like me, you don't buy the 6+ digits hype, this short essay will show potential for at least a few thousand dollars per share. BUY, HOLD, VOTE (not financial advice, yada yada).

\---

1) Basics - Forget the whole squeeze for a moment and lets consider just the business opportunity, comparing to Amazon. In 1999, when they barely sold anything beyond entertainment (so, similar to GME business model henceforth), AMZN market cap was USD 30 B in a USD 10 T GDP environment. GDP is double that now, so we can infer that a well managed company similar to 1999's Amazon is worth now USD 60 B. That alone puts $GME stock in the USD 800\~1,000 ballpark. GME is capitalising on this whole drama by revamping the business model and management, paying debt, etc. They became a sexy company, have cash to invest and attract talent, tons of exposure / publicity and the sympathy by public. They are positioning to become the biggest player in the entertainment niche (games) that will grow the most for many years.

2) Meme stock multiplier - We all saw what becoming a meme did to $TSLA from 2019 on, and all the noise by paid agents trying to mimic the effect by pumping other stocks here in r/wallstreetbets ever since. GME is already a meme stock and thus those USD 800\~1,000 will eventually turn into USD 3,000\~5,000 as they revamp their operations and shift from brick and mortar to digital. Every new product or service will be a new hype.

3) The squeeze potential - The great unknown, thus I'll not digress much about it. Can be a mirage, can be something that will spike 10x from above figures, who knows? I don't believe in 6 digits per share, but maybe low 5s if indeed they find out more votes than shares? I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the possible MOASS, but my whole point here in this post is to show that MOASS, if it ever happens, is a bonus. GME is a strong BUY (and HOLD and VOTE) regardless. But just in case I'm buying a few Calls too.

Popped my DD cherry. Hope it helps.

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SNDL is building an empire and VLNS is the missing piece I dont need to tell you about the trajectory of SNDL as a state-of-the-art licensed producer of cannabis. Part of this unstoppable trajectory is due to their strategy, industry leading technology/approach, clean balance sheet and vast amount of cash reserves they  have recently raised. Currently sitting close to a Billion dollars in cash. The question is, how can it put these resources to the best strategic use?

\-SNDL has recently announced a string of acquisitions that piece together the necessary components to emerge as the winner in the newly budding cannabis industry in North America. As US legislation at a federal level approaches, the flood gates are soon to open.  The recent acquisitions include the following:

1)Zenabis- Near the end of 2020, SNDL announced they closed the acquisition of a special purpose vehicle used to takeover a subsidiary of Zenabis Global, owning $58.9 million worth of senior secured debt of Zenabis Global. Much to the surprise of SNDL, wews abruptly came that H.E.X.0. would be acquiring Zenabis gloabl in $235 million stock deal to expand their global presence.  Despite having the cash and being ready to pull the trigger, SNDL leanred a valuable lesson not to wait too long..

2) Inner Spirit holdings- A retailer and franchisor of recreational cannabis stores. This helps increase it's market share and geographic footprint in North America. Purchased for only $106.7M. This time around, SNDL did not wait and succesfully acquired this company for strategic purposes.

3) Recently SNDL, acquired a 10% stake in The Valens Company. A growing parts supplier and leader in extraction, analysis of cannabis would make Valens an ideal fit for the growing brand and empire of Sundial. To have bought stock in the market would likely mean that an attempt to buy the company was already made. Sundial likley approached VLNS for an acquisition earlier, but when management turned down the offer they proceeded to accumulate stock.  The Valens company would be a perfect fit for Sundials future potential. 

Today VLNS announced a bought-deal offering. This leaves the door open to a few alternatives:

\-Valens mgmt is trying to avoid an outright acquisition at this time in order to further seed a strategic investor (SNDL) knowing that there will be a take-out at somepoint in teh near future.  SNDL is sitting on a billion cash, will be able to increase it's stake in the company further through this deal in order to accumulate more voteing authority over the company. Howver if the need arises, SNDL has more than enough bullets to go hostile and acquire VLNS at a premium. 

So WHAT do we DO?

I think we continue to support SNDL buying stock to support our name. Annnnd since we know that SNDL has it's eyes on VLNS ([VLNS.CA](https://VLNS.CA) \+VLNCF  US) which it may acquire in the near future at a premium. We should also buy VLNS stock so that we have the ability to tender our votes if an acquisiton were voted on. We also get the added benefit of having our VLNS shares acquired for a premium. Win-Win.

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$MVIS DD by u/hiddengooru (mods let this man post) MVIS DD 05/25

 

Hey  guys! Long time no see. Its been an exciting day for MVIS so I though  you guys might be interested in seeing the options landscape.

The  stability metric has been all over the place the past week - probably  like some of your heart rates. Looking at my stability metric, you can  see (at first) some chaos but it appears there is a nice pattern  emerging:

https://preview.redd.it/ssgru1aqbd171.jpg?width=1358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f963b7200071d3ab7a38276a0325a9929a62b72b

&#x200B;

Initially  the stability dropped well down (purple line) with the price drop and  it kinda, hovered? there. But now the purple line's trend is upwards -  this is obviously a good sign with the price also increasing. Typically I  am skeptical of price increases and the stability metric either doesn't  move or even decreases. But in this case, it seems MVIS was becoming  pretty stable with its new price.

Looking at the expected movements:

https://preview.redd.it/e1bor0qsbd171.jpg?width=1339&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c941dddd7e584037eca3c436d4d7935cd2525d0

&#x200B;

Today's  movements were just touching the top band. So perhaps tomorrow will be a  little bit of a mean reversion day but overall the trend may be picking  up in the positive direction.

Looking at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/vaj79lxwbd171.jpg?width=1363&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=20cfee7635a4cff061b080e971c1e19ca1a62786

The graphs are the same but the graph on the left show which options have greatest sensitivity to volatility (blue)

The  only concern here is that I've noticed whenever a stock over-takes a  large section of options (such as here at $15 where there is \~25k calls)  there is usually a bit of resistance. When people do 'technical  analysis' and talk about 'resistance points' they are usually indirectly  pointing out the areas with large option placements.

Looking at the options positioning:

https://preview.redd.it/kwkpy1hzbd171.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb7287184bb917592177300b0a356c1c6b224a8

&#x200B;

Reasonably  healthy option behavior. There is about 225k options that have to be  hedged if volatility drops and 190k if vol spikes. This is kinda  interesting (and kinda unusual) in that as a stock becomes more healthy  it typically becomes more liquid. In this case this will cause the  options to have to be hedged via purchasing. This is fine in so long as  liquidity stays low - if liquidity dries up then selling occurs. Without  much more on one side or the other, this usually plays out with a bit  of stagnation.

Lastly, the shorts:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/folrpww1cd171.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfb63529bb20e813ca28580e21031440efae9dac

Another  indication of good news: the shorting has been consistently well below  the running average lately. Is this because there are few shorts left or  because few purchasers? That's hard to say but overall it is usually a  good sign, especially on positive price days.

Overall,  it doesn't look too bad for MVIS - although it might experience some  mean reversion or a slight push back down to $15 to push those (now) ITM  calls back OTM, but I don't see anything that screams big downside just  yet.

Good luck!"

2021-05-25 22:06:55,wallstreetbets,"Definitely an increase! That's the problem with looking at the shorts : volume ratio - it seems the volume rose more than the shorts did. But this is also serves as a protective mechanism: if shorts need covered, even if they are at a loss, the liquidity provided by the increase in volume at least makes it possible. Whereas when you have massive liquidity issues -and- shorts that need covered, that's when things get hairy."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NVDA DD Heyoooooooooooo. 

Whatever I'm not here to impress you idiots with a catchy opening:

Lets look at NVDA. 

Looking at the stability (reddish line)

https://preview.redd.it/u10pl6qodd171.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6d6162ccd8ef4135b215f79f481d6327feb4bba

We see that for the past few months whenever the price has increased, it stretches the red line until it snaps back down. Is this occuring again with this most recent price increase? You tell me (yes). 

This is further worrisome when you look at the expected moves:

https://preview.redd.it/zrbvo6a0ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e50c0dfe36958ff7447f95dc071b13fd21fb0c3

Although earnings are coming up and they can be more drastic than normal, typically MM's and OD's don't enjoy greater-than-expected moves. 

The shorts are doing a fun dance:

https://preview.redd.it/t5b3qyp5ed171.jpg?width=1122&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6fe8bc1ed2dc94b1cd3b184d6c954b543ba3688

The most recent price increases have been met with greater increases in shorting. This can be from a variety of reasons but globally seen as a bit of a bearish sign.

The options layout:

The concerning aspect here is the largest majority of calls are at $600 (ITM) at \~30,000 of them. 

This produces:

Since those options are so ITM and volatility tends to move around earnings reports, let's look at how the options will effect the price if volatility increases:

So there are approximately 10,000,000 more shares that have to be sold with increases in volatility than purchased. So if tomorrow, volatility rises - I'd say be cautious. But if it is good news and liquidity becomes abundant, then everything favors an upside. 

There will be some mighty resistance, however - namely those 30k calls at $600. Overall, I'd be slightly gay bearish for the next week or so until either those calls are moved further upland or the price reverts back down."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Can't invest in SpaceX but you can invest in Concrete Was re-watching the Tesla Car SpaceX falcon heavy rocket launch and had what I think is a pretty genius idea. As SpaceX is not directly publicly tradable (though tied to Tesla), invest in the company that supplies the concrete/labor to repair the launchpad SpaceX uses for their rockets/tests the most.

SpaceX is not going to stop trying new stuff anytime in the near future and they are not afraid to blow stuff up (starship --- cough ---) in order to iterate on their design faster. That being said, someone out there has to actually do the repairs and supply the materials needed for the repairs to their facility.

If we can find the repair crew/supplier for SpaceX, and invest in them, then we are basically ""betting"" on SpaceX doing well (more explosions and repairs in the future)."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A thesis on the disillusion called Robinhood &#x200B;

Hi everyone,

What's going on with the alleged zero commission trading?

Limit buy others do not fill except when price movement has gone below limit price.

Limit sell orders do not fill except when price movement has gone above limit price.

Then, if you want to use the Market order, it always shorthands you, making you buy at ludicriously high prices and forces you to sell at dirt cheap prices.

Wth?

Edit:

Too short

Edit:

Still short. 

Is Robinhood still useful? Why is anyone still on it? Why I'm I still on it?"

When volume is moving the app fails to execute. You can put in a limit order and fail to get an executed trade. Servers go down every time something starts to pop. If all that is happening then no point in having a margin account.

I'm not recommending you add more (I'm also not recommending you don't, I'm not a financial advisor), but if you do I would strongly consider purchasing some moderately-ITM leaps (middle of '22 or later) to DRASTICALLY reduce your cost basis (not overall cost), far more than buying more individual shares, and you're giving yourself plenty of time to be right about your thesis. And, if you are buying ITM, then you can sell some of the more reasonable CC's that are currently available to lower your cost basis further. If they get assigned, they get assigned, you turn a profit and then can potentially buy new call options based on where you think the price will go from there. 

In the meantime you can even potentially use the credit gained from the CCs to purchase more individual shares and keep lowering cost basis, if that's your thing (although with where you're at contracts are really how you'd lower the cost basis)."

2021-05-25 21:28:52,wallstreetbets,"time for the mods to add a ""feels"" flair"
2021-05-25 21:58:04,wallstreetbets,My package is short and my wife is late after visiting her boyfriend who works at Fedex. This is not financial advice.
2021-05-26 01:09:24,wallstreetbets,A guy cut me off today in traffic. Asshole was driving a Honda. Fucking shorting Honda tomorrow... Assholes
2021-05-25 22:56:11,wallstreetbets,"Stock is high because they are pushing extreme volume through warehouses that are NOT equipped to handle such volume. I work in one such warehouse. Do not support FedEx! They do a lot of very illegal stuff to their workers and the management at every facility are the biggest bullies and psychopaths that don't care if your kidneys are failing... they will make you work in 100+ degree trailers and won't let you take water breaks.

EDIT: Also, we aren't allowed to unionize or we get fired if we even talk about it, and the pay rate SUCKS (can get paid the same to do way less dangerous and back breaking stuff, like work the drive-thru at a fast food place)... yet stock is at all-time high. Fuck FedEx and fuck Fred Smith... should've worked for UPS instead!"

2021-05-25 21:42:54,wallstreetbets,Positions or ban
2021-05-25 21:37:47,wallstreetbets,"I think all you apes are tards, but if we could crash fedexs stock, I would love that. That piece of shit company lost a $7000 audio processor around christmas. Im pretty sure one of the ghetto fucks in their warehouse or their subcontracted home delivery driver stole it. They were %1000 useless in finding it and gave me the run around for 3 months. What better way to get back at the company than to sink their stock. And this is not just for revenge, but as a company, they are terrible and their value doesnt represent the criminal behavior they employ on a daily basis by hiring contracted drivers without so much as a hint of a real criminal back ground check. Do it!"
2021-05-25 23:01:44,wallstreetbets,Damn bro! I bet it’s because he’s in a parking lot somewhere breeding your wife!
2021-05-25 21:24:27,wallstreetbets,Call the Pony Express.
2021-05-25 21:33:22,wallstreetbets,I live in the middle of nowhere and had a package delivered on time. Buying calls.
2021-05-25 21:47:21,wallstreetbets,"I am not defending FedEx, but offering an explanation of sorts.   In my area FedEx sucks and UPS is a well oiled machine.  My buddy lives across the country and in his area is experience is the exact opposite.   It appears delivery service varies by area after I started asking others who live in other areas.  

Also, there is a huge shift in how people buy stuff and everyone is drowning in shipments."
2021-05-25 22:51:03,wallstreetbets,"this is coming from a current fedex driver, 90% of the reason for this is because of the actual package handlers. the guys sorting the packages from the semis that bring them in the terminal. there’s times some semis come in and sit for a days at a time because the package handlers haven’t got them out yet. don’t get me wrong there are times where packages get misdelivered. but my point is don’t shoot the messenger essentially. there’s a lot more going on in the background than just simply one person delivering your package to your front door."
2021-05-25 23:02:22,wallstreetbets,"I bought a brand new TV on Black Friday a couple years ago and FedEx decided to put the TV right in front of the downspout on a day where it was pouring, instead of inside the garage through the unlocked door. And just a month ago I bought a SSD from Best Buy and FedEx put it in the only spot in front of my house that had direct sunlight shining on it, instead of in the garage, or barring that, the shady part of my house.

I think they do it on purpose."

2021-05-25 22:56:42,wallstreetbets,It's possible someone just stole your package and you're rage shorting for no reason
2021-05-26 00:22:54,wallstreetbets,"Considering the amount of effort they put into delivering packages and the amount they charge for what they do, their financials should look pretty good.

Not saying they're doing a good job of delivery packages."
2021-05-26 04:36:09,wallstreetbets,"Some money to be made here as it is a low volume stock. Just announced today on June 21st another surcharge hike. Forward P/E only 15, well below SP500 with plenty of pricing power as essentially a duopoly. Had a record quarter previously and poised well for the next quarter to beat expectations again. Average PO on this is 350-360 which gives a bit of a runway for LEAPS. Nothing for huge upside but safe gains for the rest of the year. Happy to share a DD I did a few months back when it was trading near $270"
2021-05-26 12:16:35,wallstreetbets,If there is a delay then it means there is too much stuff in the network. Bullish
2021-05-26 02:39:21,wallstreetbets,fedex is a fucking joke.  I work from home and kept getting notifications that the driver attempted delivery but they never rang the bell or left a notice.  I had them leave it at a walgreens so i could pick it up.  Then they lost my wife flowers she ordered for our wedding in 2018.  Lost a motherboard in 2007. Such a piece of shit i hope they go out of business.
2021-05-25 21:32:30,wallstreetbets,Bc they are a shit company. You should buy puts...
2021-05-25 21:32:45,wallstreetbets,Better then the usps imo
2021-05-25 21:25:52,wallstreetbets,No way this is serious.
2021-05-26 09:08:09,wallstreetbets,"I could get behind this, I've never had a good experience with FedEx. This past Monday I had some brake parts delivered, but they threw the package in front of my neighbor's garage and the corner of the box was blown out. It, honest to God, looked like they threw it out the window while the vehicle was in motion. My gf has a package that has been ""on vehicle, out for delivery"" since last Friday!"
2021-05-26 09:09:52,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit that happens to me too. I didn’t realize FedEx sucks for everyone. 

I don’t think they’ve ever delivered on time or had an accurate delivery date."

2021-05-26 14:07:50,wallstreetbets,Great post. Going all in on FedEx
2021-05-25 22:02:57,wallstreetbets,Man this deserves an award but all I have is this kiss 😘

2021-05-25 23:06:32,wallstreetbets,I think Frederick W. Smith should be paying you all more then maybe things will go more smoother and the stock could keep going up. Maybe it's because I live in the bay area so packages probably get delayed a lot more here.
2021-05-26 03:03:47,wallstreetbets,UPS is the way.
2021-05-25 21:46:26,wallstreetbets,I'm thinking of buying a few at $0.33 for $200 expires 7/16 have to wait until tomorrow to buy but I'll post with my position tomorrow
2021-05-25 21:49:53,wallstreetbets,But did you see them in Castaway? Oh yeah... plane crashed.... dude delivered a single beat up package a few years later though. Maybe Tom Hanks has your audio processor now.

2021-05-25 21:36:20,wallstreetbets,So what are your calls $350-400 for their stock to go up?
2021-05-25 22:18:04,wallstreetbets,"This 100%, the FedEx distribution warehouse in my area is pretty much always #1 in metrics they look for. This is a smaller location compared to most and our district includes locations from Fresno down to Rialto/LA"
2021-05-25 23:03:18,wallstreetbets,Frederick W. Smith needs to pay you all more makes no sense you all working hella hard and he's benefiting from it. It's not fair. Makes sense now that things take forever or go missing people are under paid
2021-05-25 21:52:41,wallstreetbets,May I ask what your position is? I'm just trying figure if $200 is to low I know this could for sure hit $280 soon
2021-05-25 23:08:03,wallstreetbets,Check r/FedEx so many people have problems and Frederick W. Smith CEO of FedEx needs to step it up and pay workers more. I live in the bay area so things probably have hard time getting places I'm guessing
2021-05-25 21:34:51,wallstreetbets,I'm buying puts first thing tomorrow morning
2021-05-25 21:48:56,wallstreetbets,Dhl is better then Usps
2021-05-26 06:00:35,wallstreetbets,It makes perfect sense that Fred smith makes all that money. It’s his company. He’s taking on all the risk of running the company. If FedeX goes tits up you can go work somewhere else.
2021-05-25 22:13:41,wallstreetbets,Small. I bought 20 shares - most of my investments are in $5K - $20K.

2021-05-25 21:21:21,wallstreetbets,"$GE wasn’t named on the article for the California wind farm. If they get named as the provider of the turbines I do think it’ll be great. They may the world leader in turbines but not a sure bet. I’m already YOLOd into $GE so I don’t care. 

Weird to see another degenerate posting about $GE I thought this was hated on WSB."
2021-05-25 22:46:37,wallstreetbets,GEs turbines are plagued with issues as are they designed to be as profitable as possible and they do so by skimping on quality.

I know the float is high, but high float is part of every large company. Debt to equity is recovering under the new management, but insider ownership is still low.

2021-05-25 22:00:04,wallstreetbets,Bag-holding at 23. Hoping for SOMETHING SOMEtime!
2021-05-26 17:55:15,wallstreetbets,But it does smooth out your brain.
2021-05-25 20:07:12,wallstreetbets,"It becomes long term June 23rd, so that is when I will pay off all my debts more than likely. Not giving the feds anymore than I have too!"
2021-05-25 22:05:41,wallstreetbets,I wonder that also.  I'm in at 20

2021-05-25 22:04:35,wallstreetbets,$20. Something here.
2021-05-25 21:26:15,wallstreetbets,300% is always 'great' so you did fine. Can't lose by taking profit.
2021-05-26 02:04:32,wallstreetbets,"Don’t get fomo you did good! I pulled out of gme with 20% gains and it’s gone up another 20. I’m happy I made money! It’s a casino, but it’s still better to walk out up!"
2021-05-25 20:05:12,wallstreetbets,"My shares go long term June 23 so I will hold them till at least then, maybe longer depending on the share price and action, I still have many more shares in a 401k that I am holding for either a buyout, partnership, merger, or whatever.  I believe we will see one of those before then end of 1st quarter 2022. Hopefully sooner though."
2021-05-25 20:36:45,wallstreetbets,"Holding out for them to be long term capital gains (June 23rd).  That 15% or 30% tax is a killer! I may hold some or all after they qualify for long term capital gains. Will see how things are looking. I'm patient, obviously 😂"
2021-05-26 00:04:00,wallstreetbets,Bought them June 23rd 2020
2021-05-26 13:37:44,wallstreetbets,"No biggie, play the long game my friend. Russel reconstitution is coming up soon and should see good gains solely from that."
2021-05-26 15:22:59,wallstreetbets,"Not from this account, I did in my 401k and then bought back in lower."

2021-05-26 10:31:36,wallstreetbets,Hey I held the bag in February at $19. Luckily last run up I was able to sell at $25
2021-05-25 20:16:02,wallstreetbets,Fair enough! Here's to hoping it goes higher then! 🍻
2021-05-25 20:23:47,wallstreetbets,How many shares did you cash out?
2021-05-25 22:44:18,wallstreetbets,"Hmm gotcha. I sold during that surge, and bought more back at $14. So I'm hoping for both our sakes it goes uuuup.

We have different tax rules here though (I'm in Canada) and have the luxury of a tax free trading account, meaning I don't have the same concerns as you do with capital gains.

I'm all for waiting til June for mvis to rocket though!"

2021-05-25 20:26:14,wallstreetbets,"None yet, they become long term for taxes on June 23rd, so holding out till at least then."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC WILL HIT 5 BY END OF SUMMER. AMC has filed to conduct an ""at-the-market"" (ATM) equity offering to issue and sell 43 million shares. With an ATM program, companies quietly sell stock into the open market at prevailing prices, and the amount of proceeds that are ultimately raised depend on what prices the shares are sold for. There are currently approximately 450.3 million shares outstanding, so 43 million additional shares would represent roughly 9.5% dilution.

""We have previously pointed out that the sale of up to 43 million AMC shares, the currently available amount for possible issuance under a previous shareholder authorization, should more than satisfy AMC's liquidity needs for 2021,"" CEO Adam Aron commented in a release. ""This assumes an expected recovery in the patronage of movie theatres in the second half of this year.""

I think AMC will hit 5 dollars again by end of summer. The reason I think this is because who tf is really trying to go to the movies with masks on in the heat to see movies that are being released on streaming platforms anyway. This whole ape stuff is stupid and people are losing money left and right from it. I’ve gotten so many DM’s from apes most of you have small dicks so stop trying seriously. Humanity is depressing AF right now."

I found the person who's never been to a movie theater because theaters are cold AF. It goes without saying that you've also not been to a theater since covid because nobody actually wears the mask during the movie. It's not like people are checking."
2021-05-25 20:41:43,wallstreetbets,"Soo...that 43 million shares already fucking sold and the stock rose to $13 because of it. What an imbecile....

They had that 43 million since 2013, it wasn't even a new filing."
2021-05-25 21:48:57,wallstreetbets,"Damnnnn someone is SUPER insecure in the replies, this sell on 43m shares has already happened sweetie  don’t be mad when people point out your data is severely lagging and before you comment it  “instant block I’m not even insecure I’m so rich😘” (adding a kissy face doesn’t make you any less insecure sounding)"

2021-05-26 15:06:01,wallstreetbets,Watching how salty you are getting is hilarious. You are getting so triggered at people just disagreeing with your post. This is hilarious.

I sincerely hope you get banned from this community because you're a toxic, hateful individual."

2021-05-25 22:07:34,wallstreetbets,I post my ass for fun. You shouldn’t be looking anyway mr. married man. I make my money through various things never once sold myself
2021-05-25 20:03:32,wallstreetbets,You are rude af like go tf away you weak bitch
2021-05-26 14:10:07,wallstreetbets,Good I’m glad you think so go find another one to harass then bye low life ☺️
2021-05-26 17:49:51,wallstreetbets,Definitely not but ok. I know the mentally impaired like you are on here so I will wish you well hun 😘
2021-05-25 22:09:57,wallstreetbets,I never looked dumbass your profile is NSFW and your bio is some Cringy thing about being kinky I don’t have to look to know that means you post your ass for a couple bucks 🥱
2021-05-25 20:06:00,wallstreetbets,You just say stupid shit sounding like a dumbass and than can’t answer questions about your own post. The stock is going up and has been going up hence no one is losing money left and right.
2021-05-25 20:06:55,wallstreetbets,"Oh no, the girl with no amc stock called me rude"
2021-05-26 15:50:05,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I’m not the one showing my asshole on the internet for free, darlin."
2021-05-26 19:16:29,wallstreetbets,AMC to the fuckin moon
2021-05-25 22:11:06,wallstreetbets,Well you can continue being uneducated as well as broke. Statistics do show they go hand-in-hand.
2021-05-25 20:08:07,wallstreetbets,Ok that’s your opinion you shouldn’t be in stocks if you are gonna be so sensitive
2021-05-25 20:09:01,wallstreetbets,I have 1075 shares sweetie but you don’t have that kind of money I know 😂
2021-05-26 17:51:55,wallstreetbets,Ok and? What was your point? I like showing my body if you have a problem you can shove a big dick up yours instead of worrying about mines? Occupy your time ☺️
2021-05-25 22:14:53,wallstreetbets, No it doesn’t but it’s okay I’m just proud you could spell statistics
2021-05-25 20:08:59,wallstreetbets,"Lmao you just sound stupid, someone has to let you know."
2021-05-25 20:09:33,wallstreetbets,10k shares but you are close
2021-05-25 20:58:53,wallstreetbets,Then sell and short it
2021-05-25 21:55:59,wallstreetbets,"No one cares that you sell nudes and get money, you care way too much about this for it to just be an opinion, you clearly have other motives here"
2021-05-25 22:17:37,wallstreetbets,You know what’s increasingly becoming more pathetic is that you have your stay-at-home ho yet you are on here arguing with me someone apparently “beneath you”. Interesting. Seems like that skank you put a ring on is not interesting enough
2021-05-25 20:09:22,wallstreetbets,Ok that’s your opinion once again
2021-05-25 20:10:16,wallstreetbets,Nice try but you don’t have that much. Lol I think you meant 10 shares
2021-05-25 22:00:06,wallstreetbets,Nope I’ll do what I want when I want. Go fuck yourself
2021-05-25 21:56:31,wallstreetbets,Ok well if you think that then go away don’t listen to me since you wanna be stupid
2021-05-25 22:21:31,wallstreetbets,"This is very entertaining to me actually , Im especially interested why you keep talking about someone not even involved😂you can say whatever you want I’m pretty narcissistic so I find it funny at worst 🤙"
2021-05-25 20:12:51,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-25 22:02:09,wallstreetbets,You post your ass on Reddit there’s literally no one sadder I can think of
2021-05-25 20:15:56,wallstreetbets,Go fuck yourself bye weirdo
2021-05-25 22:02:55,wallstreetbets,So every girl on OnlyFans is sad as well. Clearly you are a virgin who wishes they could have someone like me. Stay mad sweetie 😘
2021-05-25 22:04:29,wallstreetbets,"I’m married so I’m SO good little girl, I’m not a creep and I’m a few leagues above you just based on your intelligence but I’m sure you’ll get a man who will respect you…some day✌️"
2021-05-25 22:06:26,wallstreetbets,LOL the fact that you think because you are married to a pick-me whore makes you better than me is so laughable. Listen hun I’m already a millionaire as we speak so I don’t talk to broke men who think they are something fighting with a girl online. It’s really pathetic for you old man. Try fighting with the women at the retirement home you are living in
2021-05-25 22:08:45,wallstreetbets,"The girl posting her ass for a couple bucks calling my wife a whore is the only laughable thing here, And yes I definitely thing I’m much better than you in all regards 😂"
2021-05-25 22:10:12,wallstreetbets,If you could read better you would clearly see that I don’t do it for money. I know those old eyes can’t see clearly anymore. So please have your whore read it for you. You can judge me all you want but I don’t care I’m paid and well connected. I suggest you be careful who you talk crazy too.
2021-05-25 22:13:32,wallstreetbets,"Every girl who does it convinces themselves they do it cause they like it but really just don’t have the work ethic to work a job it’s okay sweetie I’m not judging you, you can do whatever you want just don’t come for other peoples lives who you have no clue about"
2021-05-25 22:16:01,wallstreetbets,Don’t be a hypocrite now because you have no insight into my life either so you 100 percent contradicted yourself.
2021-05-25 22:18:31,wallstreetbets,Actually I know your “a shy female millionaire who sells her ass for fun while thinking she’s better than everyone and is secretly kinky but doesn’t know how statistics work” 👍
2021-05-25 22:19:59,wallstreetbets,And I know you are a weak worthless man who has a wife that he clearly spends no time with because he argues with people that are beneath him over spending time with her. Must be a sad life for you.
2021-05-25 22:23:10,wallstreetbets,"Nah I’m very content thanks for the concern though  very sweet of you, I’m still not gonna buy your only fans though👍"
2021-05-25 22:23:34,wallstreetbets,It was a good effort though
2021-05-25 22:33:08,wallstreetbets,Ok well I have a life and things to do. It was fun. Goodbye I hope you and your hooker get out of the gutter soon ☺️
2021-05-25 22:34:07,wallstreetbets,Au revoir

2021-05-26 05:12:10,wallstreetbets,I would agree but the 900% UVXY premarket jump might help 👀

2021-05-25 22:10:14,wallstreetbets,the gov keeps propping shit up like the last few days on open
2021-05-26 08:49:49,wallstreetbets,yes
2021-05-26 12:42:35,wallstreetbets,This aged well
2021-05-25 20:05:36,wallstreetbets,Ya his are easier to figure in will the strike go higher say if you had 5 options as opposed to 10. The odd number options is what I'm unsure how to calculate. I understand the value doesn't change but will it affect potential payout itm or otm premium rates?
2021-05-25 20:10:30,wallstreetbets,"They may also do it like this. Pre split one contract controls 100 shares at x price and after split, one contract controls 10 shares at 10x strike price. So you would end up with adjusted option contract with (usually) less liquidity. I the same with 5 contracts just add 5 together."
2021-05-25 20:36:44,wallstreetbets,Ok thanks

2021-05-25 20:27:56,wallstreetbets,This guy was 100% right about everything today. Amazing work. Posting this wisdom for free instead of being one of these Youtube douche bags is a strong show of character. Even if you have a paid Youtube channel I can tell you're cut from a different cloth. Bravo. These posts should be sticked at the top of the subreddit everyday.
2021-05-25 20:21:47,wallstreetbets,"It's hard to believe we are even saying ""bears held 420"" when it feels like we were just cheering breaking 400. 😄"
2021-05-25 21:44:28,wallstreetbets,Took the small profit on my 5/26 419p today and rolled out the capital to the 5/28 422c at close. Let’s see that gap up tomorrow. The sp500 made a perfect band high at 4182 and bounced up. I’m hoping to see it move to the next trading band of 4238-4249

2021-05-25 21:08:15,wallstreetbets,Mr. Lahey is this you talking or the liquor?
2021-05-25 20:32:07,wallstreetbets,$GME & $AMC brothers In arms!
2021-05-25 20:47:23,wallstreetbets,Nailed it
2021-05-25 22:16:04,wallstreetbets,Trying to figure out what triggered this today. Still holding on and hoping we keep going tomorrow! Do we know what happened today that started the momentum?
2021-05-25 22:32:26,wallstreetbets,Stay calm apes. The MOAS has not begun we are light years from that. Baby steps and hold your emotions or you shoot your wad to early and be dissapointed if this consolidates and takes longer. Or worse you will sell at 100. Fucking stay calm hold and celebrate once you have hit the target. 100k
2021-05-25 22:05:01,wallstreetbets,This retard bought COIN for 408 a piece
2021-05-26 04:59:17,wallstreetbets,I’ve been lurking in the shadows waiting for this moment. Please tell me what to do I’m scared! AMC and GME is all I have 🚀🚀🌕🌕💎💎

2021-05-25 21:43:16,wallstreetbets,Brothers with your dicks out and friendly firing
2021-05-26 01:19:16,wallstreetbets,"The hedges had about 2 million shares to try and contain the price while they were forced to buy back some stocks to cover due to T-21, and T-35 which happened today and yesterday...they ran out trying to keep it under 187, and without that reverse pressure the price exploded. It seems they have now gained around 600k new shares to short tomorrow, but now that it has crossed the 200 barrier more than 700k call options are now itm meaning the price likely will continue to go up possibly into the 300s, and then to crazy town if they can't figure out a way to stop it, and nail it back down to sub 200 by tomorrow."
2021-05-25 22:28:42,wallstreetbets,"i’m retarded, but others have figure GME follows a T+21 cycle. which i think means at the end of the month, smaller brokerages get margin called and have to buy back their shorted shares. i could be wrong, though"
2021-05-26 01:04:16,wallstreetbets,"Nothing, apes are just trading between apes."
2021-05-26 06:01:08,wallstreetbets,I hope that 100k figure is AMC. GME floor went to 20 Milly a while ago
2021-05-25 23:12:58,wallstreetbets,Ape need memo 🍌new floor 500K 💎🦍💨🖍
2021-05-25 23:41:24,wallstreetbets,Hey I am a professional retard and I had some extra cash in my account when it IPO’d. I’ll hold until I can average down with more shares. It’s not about the entry it’s about the exit.

2021-05-26 00:53:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC on the other hand has had strong buying pressure for weeks while fighting off a 43m dilution and its biggest single investor selling 30m shares. Both those things are done now and the price is doing what it has tried to do many times before, but now there's nothing to stop it.

Shares to borrow are non existent as well."
2021-05-26 05:17:48,wallstreetbets,"You guys really have to stop using ""margin call"" for everything lol"
2021-05-26 06:49:46,wallstreetbets,It is for AMC I did not get the 20 mill floor for GME. This is evolving faster than I can count. Sorry ape. New floor upgraded. Thank you. 🦍🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🌙🌙🌙
2021-05-25 23:18:57,wallstreetbets,Duly noted and will upgrade all floors moving forward. Thank my fellow ape for the updated version of our moon floor. 🌙🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

2021-05-26 16:59:35,wallstreetbets,Not talking about bod/offer spread in FTX. I'm talking about the gap between FTX and the stock market. They are literally paying you money to leverage

2021-05-25 21:41:39,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at 12 bucks in January, thinking it would be part of the meme stocks that squeeze due to HF betting against it.  Been a bag holder ever since , long term hold for me at this point ."

2021-05-26 12:11:32,wallstreetbets,Do you think Blackberry go up?
2021-05-26 12:17:10,wallstreetbets,"I got in so damn late. BB seems like a good long term investment, but I've only seen red so far. I was actually just googling ""future blackberry phones"" randomly when the first hype train left the station (stock ticker was in the search results), not knowing about this community, and just bought a bunch of stock because I thought something more anchored in the real world was happening. I thought it had to do with news of a partnership with Baidu or something. I have a Blackberry phone running android and love it, I hope the new owner of the phone manufacturing license does a good job. They've been suspiciously silent for a company that's planning to release a new phone this year. I listened to some interviews with the folks at Onward Mobility, and I'm not convinced they know what they're doing."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"May 2021 CPI data are scheduled to be released on June 10, 2021, at 8:30 A.M. Eastern Time. Source: https://www.bls.gov/cpi/

CPI = measure of inflation

Inflation matters because if inflation numbers come out just as high as last time, it will give more credence to the people screaming runaway inflation.

Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

When rates rise, risk assets go poof.

Stocks and coins will either finally be dead or return to the atmosphere on this day.

**Bets**

>**BEAR** You hate the government. Inflation is here to stay from reckless printing. You think CPI will come out sky high, the highest financial authority of the land will be publicly embarrassed and raise rates. Michael Burry is a revolutionary who can be Cassandra without transitioning. You are here to own the libs.

[Basic]: Long banks and industrials, sell everything else

[Risky]: $FAZ, $SQ calls

[YOLO]: June & July $300 QQQ puts

[You hate money]: 1DTE QQQ put on June 9

>**BULL** You believe in the emperor Jamie Powell and the fair lady Yellen. May CPI was just transitory inflation from a burst of demand. You have eyes and see that commodity futures are correcting. You are emboldened by the recovery of coins and growth stocks in the past weeks. You love buying high.

[Basic]: Buy anything but the banks and industrials.

[Risky]: $ARKK, $SQ calls

[YOLO]: June & July calls on literally any growth stock

[You hate money]: 1DTE QQQ call on June 9

Godspeed."

2021-05-25 21:59:13,wallstreetbets,Yellen is not a fair lady she is as close you can get to an earthly antichrist. I would suck Jpows toes for another stimmy tho hehe.
2021-05-26 00:01:19,wallstreetbets,"> Runaway inflation is really bad because it will force the federal reserve to raise rates.

Why jump from inflation to runaway inflation. Fed probably will tolerate it for at least few months. Re-opening inflation is almost given, and expected. World economy waking up after a year long slumber will stretch her legs and is in heat"
2021-05-26 03:01:50,wallstreetbets,"Depends on how they manage the narrative. Will probably announce it as ""ExpecteD"" ""transitory"" etc..."
2021-05-26 05:51:49,wallstreetbets,I have a feeling the fed is going to continue to deny inflation long past the point where inflation is obvious and it becomes a running joke
2021-05-26 05:52:53,wallstreetbets,you had me at lubricants industry
2021-05-26 07:25:45,wallstreetbets,What is the cause of supply chain disruptions? Could it be costs are going up in transportation? Would inflation be causing this? How about wage inflation causing supply chain disruptions?
2021-05-25 20:05:04,wallstreetbets,"Speaking for my industry, our costs for an internal lubricant supplier are at least 30% higher today than the start of 2020. Same as transportation, packaging, and overhead. There is no way we are the only company feeling the pinch. We, along with our competitors, have passed on several price increases in the last 6 months to our customers. These customers are mainly manufacturers."
2021-05-26 08:26:59,wallstreetbets,"It’s because the world economy shut down for a year. It is expensive to make and hold stock of raw materials if you can’t sell them, it’s not free to use a warehouse or even guarantee that your materials aren’t ruined in storage. The cost of transportation increasing would not be because of an increase in wages, again several of those costs are associated with months of shutdown. The idea that rising wages causes supply of a good to decrease is not consistent with intertemporal models, especially in the long run. Additionally the wage increase has not been across the board for everyone in the economy. The supply chain disruption is in chips (leading to car price increases) that are primarily made in China and some other parts of Asia (I don’t believe they have had a significant wage increase, please correct me if I’m wrong not trying to be sarcastic I really don’t know). 

Please look at the median inflation not the average and then compare it to the price deflator. There is a reason economist have multiple tools to measure the relative price of things. The CPI is a great tool but it is not the end all be all and it has a tendency to overstate in its own way. (I know price deflator has its downfalls too). But comparing them will generally let you know if your off base when one has “flashing lights”

If there were a wage increase as you hypothesized than inflation is negating that to where the wage increase is offset by the price of the goods and there is no real change only nominal. Compare the nominal wage increase data that you have to the nominal inflation rate and see what the real difference is and if you believe that number is extreme enough to classify as runaway inflation.

The last thing is this, inflation isn’t bad. Especially when macro growth has been centralized and over stated by gig economy workers since the last recession. We need inflation and have always had it, if we don’t it means we aren’t growing as an economy. It also makes it relatively cheaper to pay back personal debt, which is something that burdens almost everyone that had a “wage increase” 

You also forgot to mention that whole wage increase was going on the central bank was buying bonds of companies at a rate and risk they never had before. I guess my main point is inflation is a tool to use but doesn’t control everything. There is a lot more going on than just inflation going up so the stock market moves. You gotta dig deeper

This is all my opinion and you can tell me to F off, one love."
2021-05-26 11:32:46,wallstreetbets,"> We need inflation and have always had it, if we don’t it means we aren’t growing as an economy.

You seem to understand quite a few fundamentals, so this statement surprised me.

Inflation is a reference to the *nominal* value of money.  It simply means the money supply isn't keeping pace with growth.   

Productivity gains tell us whether the economy is growing.   Inflation tells us there is an inverse relationship between the money supply and real goods and services.   This could be because productivity growth is outpacing the money supply, or it could be that real growth is shrinking, but the money supply is shrinking faster."
2021-05-25 20:02:27,wallstreetbets,"Yes, so they will lose against less inflationary currency, gold and bond yields.

It would be a great idea to buy stocks at that point, if you expect inflation to wane. You would rather hold gold, land, real estate etc. until that point where inflation peaks though.

Playing inflation is tricky and those assets may not catch the real depreciation of currency as well but they are surely better bets than most stocks."
2021-05-26 12:01:24,wallstreetbets,"You’re absolutely right. I misspoke.

Ask them to bring something to throw in the soup, remind them they were an asshole last time and brought their own soup stone, so they'll need to bring something better this time. Then you call other friends, maybe invite the neighbors, even the ones you don't like. Tell everybody that you're throwing a delicious soup party and that they just need to bring something good to throw in so that there'll be enough for everybody. Maybe call grandma as well, she always makes a mean soup. At the end of the day you end up with all the leftover soup stock, for no more than the price of a stone.

Its just insane and keeps growing. Plus after school season parents will be shelling out even more money for coins, just to keep them quiet… I would not bet against Roblox at this point."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Electric Vehicles: Ford vs. General Motors Ford:
Ford’s plan to invest in EVs and self-driving cars rose to $29 billion, including $22 billion for EVs through 2025. 

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford’s growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford’s operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. 

General Motors:

General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025.

The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC.

Difference:
Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. 

Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions.

Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups.

This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:

- Autonomous driving technology.
- Connected car tech & fleet management.
- Electric vehicle technology.
- Automotive retail.
- Mobility-as-a-service & shared mobility.

Who wins?
In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars.

I will keep buying Ford, because of the potential technology integration.

2021-05-25 20:06:29,wallstreetbets,"I work in the industry, I think you are confusing autonomy with software. Ford is working with Google for connected experiences/in-car features, not working with Waymo (to my knowledge).

2021-05-25 22:42:10,wallstreetbets,Ford all the way. They are electrifying their best sellers and they are doing it with great care and excellent engineering. Check out Sandy Munro’s videos on YouTube. GM is electrifying what? The Bolt crossover and the Hummer. A mediocre econobox and an exercise in excess that will make a great bling mobile but can only sell in the US and in small numbers. I rather like Ford’s strategy.
2021-05-26 18:02:52,wallstreetbets,"Both Ford and GM are entering a world of hurt. Ford is much further behind GM in acquiring cells. For instance, Ford is talking about needing 240 GWh of cells by 2030. Tesla will reach half that point next year. And their 2030 target is 3 TWh.

Ford has only secured enough cells for the F-150 for about 40,000/year production, which will then double a year or two later. Neither the Mach-E or the F-150 Lightning will be gross margin positive for a while, only contribution margin positive. Ford has almost no scale when it comes to EVs… and the EV specific components dominate the COGS of EV’s. Plus, every EV they make is taking a high margin product and replacing it with a negative margin product. How many do you think they can do of that before the financial stress kills them?"
2021-05-25 23:11:34,wallstreetbets,So now is a good price on Ford? What is your exit price target and when? Thanks
2021-05-26 01:33:06,wallstreetbets,"On this short timeframe, any money spent on Autonomous Vehicles is a wasted money. So Ford has better capital allocation."
2021-05-26 15:31:15,wallstreetbets,"The company with the least commitment to EV is what I'd be long.    

Ford didn't need a bailout the last time because they kept making trucks and didn't enter the EV Hype like GM did last go'round..

Winter will be here soon.   With winter comes 20% less battery efficiency.   Longer Nights means more condensation and more use of electrical system, heat, defrost, Lights.. plus the know-all-lienneals with their mobile devices charging in all the data ports..

Nothing like all that to remind the kiddies how a battery works."
2021-05-25 23:50:34,wallstreetbets,"One major hurdle for existing auto manufactures is transitioning from gas to EV  without losing sales. Ford stopped selling sedans years ago and has used that time to switch to EV. The number one selling truck in the US is already at production status. It will be very easy for Ford to go full EV and not be left in the dust when society is ready to leave gas. 

GM is simply adding new auto lines which will bite them in the @$$ in the long run. They aren't adapting...

Ford gets a lot of shit but I believe theyll be the one who is successful in completely changing their business model to the new way. The big three will be Tesla, Volkswagen, and FORD...."

2021-05-25 20:27:46,wallstreetbets,It will become vastly cheaper to make EV cars while keeping the same price range which ends up making for greater margins. Margins right now suck for the auto industry. Tech gadgets have waaaay better margins. This is why they want to make these things essentially smart phones with wheels.

2021-05-26 03:05:39,wallstreetbets,They specifically talked about that point tho. I was actually impressed they specifically mentioned their ICE trucks and cars for people where EV is not an option. Looks like Ford doesn't care about the rhetoric they are about functionality primarily. The ICE trucks will be around for a while.

After a day of small losses it makes you feel pretty shitty and you wish you could have gains and be the true high iq investor you believe you are and seeing a red number on your screen makes you depressed and since you’re too poor to be an alcoholic you have to find a different way to avoid this depression. This is where Wall Street bets comes in. 

You log on and find a group of autist who would make 10x more money if they smashed a keyboard with their head repeatedly till a order went through, but they aren’t smart enough to do so and they also don’t have the brain capacity to understand risk management so this results in heaps of loss porn which makes your depression go away and makes you more confident in your intelligence.

But this isn’t because people are naturally this retarded, if they were they wouldn’t have a brokerage account, that’s where the magic of Wall Street bets shines. A already stupid degenerate with a brokerage accidentally stumbled upon this Reddit and decided to scroll and laugh and ultimately slowly lose brain cells, this goes on and on till they lose so many brain cells that they put all their life savings into a shitty stock because BALLSEATER99 told them it has to go up. They then lose their life savings and post loss porn and leave to never be seen again but for each retard that losses their life savings 2 replaces them.

Load up on the way down, sell only when green.  I'm not so good at picking when to get out, but I seem to have a knack for either entering at the right point or managing a falling knife scenario.  I've had several limit buys either dead on or penny from the true bottom.  I've had a buy simply not show up on the candle.

Honestly the falling knife is more fun and red excites me.

Edit: I'm currently loading up on RIDE as hard as I can while managing what I have in motion elsewhere in my portfolio."

2021-05-25 20:29:01,wallstreetbets,"People always say ""WSB compromised"" when their favorite stock isn't dominating the front page. Today, that stock seems to be AMC.

So I took a look at the last 3 hours of removed submissions for AMC posts to see if any of them were removed, which shouldn't have been.

**TL;DR: Thank god we have bots because I would lose my mind if I had to remove all these terrible, terrible, zero effort, rule breaking posts.** Some of this content may be allowed on other subreddits. Heck it may even get thousands of upvotes on other subreddits, but here on WSB we ask people to do the bare minimum. We do our best to avoid threads that are market manipulation / hollow confirmation bias / misinformation.

On another note, regulators are looking at social media and its influence on stock prices. If we're not doing our absolute best, they can use whatever they find to justify restricting what retail traders can do or say.

You guys saw it live. In the GME hearing, Gabe Plotkin brought up an ""antisemetic comment"" that was deleted within 5 minutes and that received no upvotes. If it wasn't for u/spez shutting that claim down, who knows what would have happened."

2021-05-26 04:50:25,wallstreetbets,MicroVision is steadily rising at the end of the video and it'll continue rising today because today is the annual shareholder meeting. The stock is going up along with the mentions. Yesterday MVIS broke the resistance at $15-$15.50 and today it may break $16.30 without much effort. The next resistance is around $20 and it's all the way up to $30 after that.

2021-05-25 21:02:57,wallstreetbets,"> I saw mods deleted and reinstated and threads continuously deleted and re-stickied. 

Mods are not deleted, they got removed and readded because reddit does not give us functionality to move admins around. **This has been said many, many times.**

The only threads that get stickied are daily discussions, megathreads (which should be used very sparingly), weekly earnings, rules threads, and the occasional joke thread. (e.g. that guy's cat megathread)

>  I remember one of the new mods 'wsbincinerator' who was then removed quickly

Literally just someone's alt. According to the modlog they had no mod actions. Your point?

> This sub gained 8mil + members and the only content that get 10k+ likes is GME related.

Because all the people that came over, came over because of GME. I know. Mindblowing.

Also, meaningful discussion will ALWAYS get lower engagement than funny memes or confirmation bias. That's how social media works.

We could probably make every top post 10K+ upvotes every day if we just allowed anything to be posted. But all the posts would just be the lowest quality confirmation bias. 

...and then where would the discussion for the next big stock go? Probably not the echo chamber. 

> I'm not necessarily saying you have been bought off or that you're on anyones side, just seems something has happened, i don't know what.

Yes. 8 million people joined reddit and started acting like it was facebook. 

>  I just want my GME megathread 

The GME megathread causes silos and only sowed division between GME diehards and GME haters. The subreddit normally goes through swings as it trades whatever is moving the most, but by separating people, many people never got to see what the subreddit actually is."

I would tell them the party is over and to GTFO so it was clear they are no longer wanted.

WSB wants to capitalize on the growth of their channel, that's why they haven't told people to GTFO.

But yet they complain about what the ""party goers"" are doing."

2021-05-25 22:48:42,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, him. Well, he's no longer a mod if that helps. 

We did talk to him, and to the team in general, about overzealousness in removing posts. To empathize with him, in late January / early February, it was chaotic to say the least, and we were all more heavy handed than usual.

We've done a pretty big 180 since then actually. I do my best to leave warnings instead of bans (even short bans) and zjz amended the bots to do same. We also implemented a ""DD revival"" process, where any DD that gets removed gets put into a queue for everyone to see (on discord)

Back to your point though, just looking at his past 87 thread removals (from Feb 26th onwards), 13 are GME, and 6 are AMC, which is a pretty low proportion IMO. The remainder were mostly SPACs. All of them (I only skimmed them) seem pretty reasonable removals, so my guess is we did talk to him and things calmed down -- but probably not as fast as would be optimal."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BB - Expect Large Movements WithIn 1 Month.  

Hello Hivemind,

From a fundamentalist and technical analysis perspective, I predict with a high degree of certainty that there will be strong price action coming within the next month, and I believe it'll be upward momentum. Here's why:

Fundamentally.  
\-Earnings are in a month. Here we may have another chance at the possibility of seeing the FB settlement or selling of Huwaei patents  
\-Earnings should beat last quarter. I promise you this hack on Colonial pipeline puckered a lot of businesses anuses and companies must all be looking at the best possible ways to increase their end-to-end security, also the shoutout from the hacker Darkside recommending Cyclance (IF the texts were real) is bigger than you think. Also, those of you who are invested and or bag holding should have also subscribed to Cyclance for $29, every one of those subscriptions helps their bottom line.  
\-Increase in advertisements. A lot more sponsored ads coming up on Reddit, Twitter, and also in other forms from Blackberry.  
\-No publicity is bad publicity. We still get connected with Jim Cramer's ""Reddit Stocks"" list on TV, but our price action never moves that drastically in comparison to the S&P 500. I have no doubt in my mind those who actually do their research, follow the price action, and the news from this company they'll see what treasure lies in store, but they could be looking for a better entry price. Currently, the average price target from CNN is $8.76 and $BB is very close as of writing at $8.60. Analyst projections going from $4.60 to $20. Following analyst's opinions are not always a great indicator, but this helps my prediction that there will be some turbulence will be coming soon, up or down.  
\-Massive institutional investment. I cannot stress this enough. Go on Fintel.io and you'll see recent additions to their portfolios from names like:  
\-Citadel. Bought 1,400,000 shares this quarter. Net Long on calls and puts  
\-Great West Life Assurance - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of New York - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Bank of Montreal - 400,000 shares this quarter  
\-Many others, such as PrimeCap, Fidelity, and Vanguard  
Institutions are getting in, and heavily. there is a possibility that the price was beaten or manipulated down so institutions may enter at a cheap price but that's a different conversation, this is a conversation about $BB and the large chance of a movement, not manipulation.

Technical analysis.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4di35esjtb171.png?width=2177&format=png&auto=webp&s=822146cd7f5af19db4410aeae6646557bd864cd9

From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further.  
An interesting note to make is how nicely the candles follow the Bollinger bands up and down, as well as when they touch the 50/200 DMA. Once the two cross that'll be either our death or golden cross. Hard to say which way, but I'd suggest it's up with all these companies are increasing their portfolio of $BB by 30%+.

This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9avjw90ltb171.png?width=2181&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f8c005da597398a5c107c70ab62c72b61d6e467

This chart shows the significance of \~$8.60 from history going back to April 2017 on the farthest left. The green dotted line shows how many times it acted as support but as well as resistance.  
This makes our current price range very strong because of how many times BB has touched \~$8.60. There have been times where it has tested below but eventually it has propped itself back up so far every time. It acted as resistance during the first stage of the WSB rally in January, came back down, and that was the signal to the upside.  
The next signal to the upside is \~$14.51 because of the yellow line. That was resistance during the WSB rally in which the daily candle spiked up and as well as acted at resistance on Jan 18 and as well after the crash.  
If $BB breaks \~$14.51 and secures it, $BB may go parabolic again.

But what if it goes down?  
The next support line below \~$8.60 is \~$6.50. But that probably won't happen because of $BB's Enterprise value. As of writing based the enterprise value is $4.98B and in comparison, our market cap is $4.81B, which puts BB's enterprise value and market cap very close in line with each other.

Final notes:  
I believe with a very high degree of confidence that $BB is going to move up now and we've reached very close to the bottom. I understand that it is impossible to predict the market but with these tools, research, my personal understanding of the market and its psychology involved, I think that $BB is primed and the uptrend may begin.

I am not your financial advisor. I am not a professional. I am only a mere student of the game which is life and the market.

I hold 2000 shares of BB and will be adding upon confirmation of the upside.

Please comment below on anything else you believe should be added to this if you have any additional insight to bring forward and I'll certainly edit it in."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GME Anchored VWAP [https://www.tradingview.com/x/1kzwgopj/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1kzwgopj/)

GME has been consolidating between the bag holders of the first and second peaks. As you can see, on average, nobody is bag holding now. This is good sign for bulls. I would expect a retest of the 195/200 range. If that holds, it's game on.

&#x200B;

Mods, this is a technical analysis post...not a freaking literary dissertation. Having a length requirement on a post that is obviously going to mostly consist of a picture is ridiculous. Bad Bot.

&#x200B;

If we really need to get this longer then why don't I explain the significance of VWAP. It stands for volume weighted average price. It basically shows the price normalized by the volumes of buyers and sellers that have bought/sold in the past. Why is this important? It's important because it more accurately indicates where there are zones of overhead supply (bag holders waiting to sell once they break even) or pent up demand (most holders are feeling good and waiting to buy dips). In this case, price has been stuck between the psychology of two market participants; the bag holders and the (not?) bag holders. Now that price is above both VWAP levels, more market participants are ITM than not ITM. This means less selling pressure. This means moon.

edit: Fuck I almost forgot....

2021-05-25 20:13:34,wallstreetbets,"Good question. ""standard"" VWAP is configured to anchor from ""session"" so defacto its a daily metric. Anchored VWAP is basically the same thing but you stipulate a custom anchor point. It could definitely be fairly arbitrary if you just pick a random point to anchor on, but it can also be very telling if you anchor on a major pivot point, significant break out level, YTD, or other high profile points."

2021-05-26 14:11:09,wallstreetbets,"I haven't tracked any of the short interest in a long time, but in general I would expect that this thing has less and less of a chance of mooning as time goes on. Mainly due to the fact that the funds involved are not going to be caught off gaurd this time and they will hedge if they see any signal that spooks them. In other words, the main thesis here is that an epic short squeeze is going to play out still but short squeezes happen when shorts are caught with their pants down. That already happened and pants have been pulled back up now."

I feel like an alternative conclusion though is that people are now more likely to sell.

The higher we go above VWAP, the greater the incentive to realize gains."

In both careers and relationships, to stand in strength, navigate with poise, and evolve with purpose, it is important to humbly acknowledge and respect endings when they come. Adopting a different vantage point with clarity need not invalidate the importance of past versions and visions; recognizing incompatibilities between characters, will, and ambitions while learning from past faults need not nullify the positive imprint that people have left on our lives. Not all ill-fitting pieces are bad pieces and even bad pieces are not completely devoid of positive projections. Some have allowed us to feel out our own edges, smoothed and strengthened them in the process of collectively trying to make things work. Disappointment, surprise, and grief do not negate the finality, inevitability, and weight of the conclusion, even though it is human nature to delay the admission as such. Things will rarely, if ever, end as a well-deserved deep and hard slumber on a perfectly supple bed of fresh linen, on the backdrop of an amber-crimson sunset bleeding itself indistinguishably into the baby blue skyline. Although, looking back, the lines of where it all started may have become blurry, the line of where things end should not be an arbitrary one. It should be decisive and intentional.

———————-LEAKED SYNOPSIS———————-

With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market’s hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

“Thank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.”

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant. 

SPY senses she’s not out of harms way. She winced as JPOW leans in to her ear and whispers: “I put on my robe and wizard hat.”"

2021-05-25 20:11:14,wallstreetbets,"Just a friendly heads up to anybody holding winning AMC lottery tickets seeing the ""$100 or $1000 (or whatever) is not a meme"" posts. 

Be aware that shit will turn you into a bagholder. It will set an unreasonable price anchor in your head that will make you make bad choices and not get out when you should.

Take it from someone who missed out on $100,000+ GME gains because I got it into my head that ""$1000 is not a meme"" -- maybe it's not...but if you've got options that expire, it sure as shit is. 

DTE is *meaningless* when the top will be fleeting. And there will be a top. 

Nobody knows what it will be, but trust me, the feeling of missing out on some extra gains because you sold ""too early"" is **WAY WAY** less terrible than bagholding and watching 80%+ of your gains evaporate when the rug gets pulled. It will haunt you forever.

Stairs up, elevator down...it's not going to just fizzle out slowly. People saying ""wait for the top and sell on the way down"" are either idiots or want you to hold their bags. Go look at GME charts for 1/27 and 3/10...hell, look at the AMC chart for 1/27...it wasn't pretty and not having an exit strategy has fucked me up mentally for months and cost me an early retirement."

———————-LEAKED SYNOPSIS———————-

With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market’s hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

“Thank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.”

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant. 

SPY senses she’s not out of harms way. She winced as JPOW leans in to her ear and whispers: “I put on my robe and wizard hat.”"

Since this is in the 30 days before i take the loss, is this a wash sale prohibiting me from writing off a loss on the call positions?

As I know, in times like these, it is human nature to simply give up.  And sometimes, when the going gets tough, one must stick it out to separate the strong from the crowd.

Who could have guessed that tripling down on losing positions in the biggest bull market for a decade could have been anything but the best of ideas.

However, I have decided that enough is enough, and I will be coming clean to you tomorrow on national television.

My people have called me back home, and this thought experiment has deemed your planet worthy of ascension.  Details on all major media platforms at market open.

2021-05-25 20:12:33,wallstreetbets,"Still distraught from the wild bear attacks of this afternoon SPY can vividly remember being surrounded by the towering shadowy figures and their throbbing red bear cock. Pinned down by the alpha, he was ready to thrust into her as the group sneered and laughed. The alpha bear saw an entry point and began to drill his member into SPY. She closed her eyes and clenched her jaw hoping someone, anyone would help her find an exit strategy. Just as soon as the alpha entered his position he was met with resistance. With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market’s hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

“Thank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.”

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant. 

SPY senses she’s not out of harms way. She winced as JPOW leans in to her ear and whispers: “I put on my robe and wizard hat.”"

2021-05-25 20:26:40,wallstreetbets,"I mean, everything is possible. But keep in mind how ""share price"" works. If at $100k per share, yes the market value would be implied at 45 trillion or w/e the fuck the calc is. However, keep in mind that not all of the outstanding shares will be sold or purchased at  $100k. Thats probably totally impossible. Probably not even 5% of the outstanding shares. So the ""share price"" is always misleading in a sense if you know what i mean. If that ridiculous ""price"" ever happens, it would just be a real-time display of a small portion of the company's outstanding shares being traded at that moment and at that moment only."

2021-05-26 06:05:24,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, there is some weird shit going on with the bid side of GME Lvl2 data. Whenever it s going up too fast, it gets swarmed by algos selling only one share and the price goes down. And as soon as you see the 1 disappear it s only going up. 

I wouldnt mind if the price was going down like any other stock with, 1-100-50-69-1000 shares getting sold, but when the only thing you see on lvl2 are 1 for like 10 minutes and they keep lowering the bid, that s just weird. Especially when it happens several times in a single day and always in a good upward momemtum."

2021-05-25 21:34:03,wallstreetbets,"This is a good question, but you will most likely get a better answer on a different sub. There's an interesting article on fairmark around wash sales and options, but it suggests that they mainly apply to making a new option for the same stock within the period after it closes out as a loss; e.g. you buy a call, it expires worthless, you open up a call on the same stock (even if it's a different strike and amount), it could be grounds for a wash. The article said nothing about a call and a put combo. So I'm not sure, and I'd ask this question on a different sub. Good luck"

Short term I also choose GME shareholders meeting is coming up and if they receive more votes than there are shares some fuck-shit will happen. To me AMC is it's little brother with much less squeeze potential and I don't think it has the steam to break 20. I've been watching them both very closely since december."

2021-05-25 22:37:41,wallstreetbets,It has no debt. Over 100% institutional ownership not including retail. It has been consolidating the last 2 months and just broke out to the upside. Massive cult following that will push higher. DFV bought 50k more shares at 150 ( most likely a permanent support similar to his last purchase) and exercised for 50k on top of that. Ryan Cohen built chewy from the ground up and is worth 30B in a sector worth much less than gaming. They are pivoting toward e-commerce from brick and mortar. They closed stores in an attempt to decrease cost of doing business but managed to increase sales. Last quarter online sales were up something nearly 150%. Literally what's not to like. I hold single digit shares ( because it's what I can afford) in my fidelity Roth IRA which I'll hold forever and single digits in both my indevidual on fidelity and my robinhood.

2021-05-25 20:21:52,wallstreetbets,"I was on both sides of it...I both sold too early and held too long. 

I can definitively say that between the two the ""holding too long"" and watching it all burn to the ground in a few minutes feels WAY fucking worse. Like $ROPE worse. I've stressed about it so much I thought I was going to have a stroke.

If you're like me and get caught in it, you still won't sell even if it does recover some after crashing. You'll get anchored on what you ""had"" and feel like it's owed to you, so you'll keep waiting for it to go back up, but you'll just keep leaving more on the table as it keeps draining away.

The top can't be called...so the best advice I can offer is to have a tiered exit strategy, set some limit orders all along the way up and just walk away. Be content with sampling the curve and you'll come out ahead with far fewer regrets...the chances of calling the exact top and unloading everything at the perfect moment is the real ""meme""."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Here’s some DD that WSB had been lacking So a week ago I bought 4K in options for ARKX and UFO.  It started when I had the prophetic revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector. And because increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I stopped smoking weed.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report sometime in June. However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  After every national emergency, such as saying this is foreign tech would be, it has caused defense contract stocks to go up 5-10%. Also many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  Finally I looked up ufo on google trends today and it is up 3x its 12 month average.  Google trends have been shown to foresee increase in prices. So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?"

This is not a financial Advise,

RBLX has been on a bull run for past week and more. I wanted to to highlight few critical points here.

RBLX is approaching its resistance, Bearish in short term.  
It might fight $90 for 1 or 2 days, and then retrace to 21 ema (must be close to the ascending support line around $72) Wise decision would be to close a position now and re-enter at a lower price.  
Another data point to be cautions, analysts 12 month high price target - $90.

Trade cautiously, do your own DD.

2021-05-26 01:04:24,wallstreetbets,Same situation. What did you do? I still have mine
2021-05-26 15:06:03,wallstreetbets,"Most of my close family and relatives children play it, I played quite a bit of it back in 2012-14ish. Most popular games are based on yearly installments of a franchise, while Roblox is endlessly developed and maintained by its community. The only similar game is Minecraft, which Roblox has an edge over because of its editor. Roblox's editor is easy for children to pickup, and I know of at least 10 people who have gone onto fruitful careers in video game development and tech. The groups in roblox make real money and pay people to develop and run them. Minecraft on the other hand after their sell to microsoft has made modding much more corporate similar to Bethesda's model which turns seasoned modders off because they would rather make money working for a different project that will sustain itself than the time commitment to follow minecrafts split between several seperate versions, the number of changing online requirements, java restrictions, and so on. Roblox's editor even back in 2012 universally worked between a large span of updates and I assume they have kept it as adaptable as is were back then. They never restricted content as heavily as other games and user control I believe is still seemingly lax. Their goal of bringing children into programming and video game development by extension has always been great. The game is so diverse a little kid does not need a huge PC to play a CSGO emulator, and this contributes to user retention because the kids do not have to beg their parents for seventy different games.

TL:DR the product is maintained by the community with great support from the company itself, and will always be. No other game does this. The in game economy will contribute to equally as much user retention if you quickly study the lifetime of team fortress 2.

IMO I would say Roblox has a great outlook for the next 5 years as more children are being educated online and are tied to the net for their social lives. It introduces them to programming and has an economy where kids learn how to capitalism. Is the market cap justifiable? I mean look at everything else. As long as it doesn't get taken over by SJWs trying to reeducate children into raging gay fascists then long term if they expand into educating young people on computer science(giving certifications = bad, introducing to programming and showing feats of their engine/creativity = good) and the like beyond 5 years they will be a great company. I would flip to sell if/when the heads and lead developers swap out, most tech companies when they begin switching staff distort the love put into the original product. The potential for it to become a meme stock is also at least above 25%."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"VMEO's IPO had perfect timing (and not by accident) Something interesting happened today. Vimeo, the video hosting service that is 100x better than YouTube but still nobody knows about (except losers like me) just had it's IPO today and it got fucked!

Currently the stock is down 15-20% from the opening bell. Who cares? Nobody is fever-buying IPOs like they were late last year or early this year. But this is actually the perfect time to buy in. Why? Well this IPO is actually occurring exactly when YouTube is just about to fuck over all of the business YouTube accounts in the USA.

What is YouTube doing to fuck over businesses? Well they are starting to run ads on non-partnered content. See source here, from the November terms of use update: [https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/83733719/updates-to-youtube%E2%80%99s-terms-of-service-november-%E2%80%9820?hl=en&amp%3Bmsgid=83733719&msgid=83733719)

If you don't want to read this, basically it says that channels that aren't partners are now going to get ads on their videos and YouTube is keeping ALL of the revenue (fuck you, right?). I've personally already witnessed this because I manage YT channels for several businesses and I've already gotten ads. And guess who gets a call every time their client sees an ad on their videos? Me, I get the call. 

&#x200B;

**When does this happen?**

It's already started. I've started seeing ads on corporate non-monetized and uncopyrighted videos within the last couple weeks, but the change is supposed to be implemented across the country in June. I've already been getting calls from my boss and from clients. We are already moving a lot of content to Vimeo.

&#x200B;

**Why does this matter?** 

Businesses are not going to be happy if their competitors are running ads on their videos. Especially if that ad occurs when the video is embedded on their own website. I know for a fact that ads are showing in YouTube but there has been no distinction that I'm aware of that would prohibit them from running ads in embedded videos on a website or blog. 

&#x200B;

**What is going to happen?**

If businesses start seeing competitor ads on their videos, they will do everything they can to stop it. They can either join the YPP and disable ads or they can leave the platform. However, there are requirements to the YPP:

1. They must have 1,000 subscribers
2. They must have 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months

I can promise you that most businesses do not even come close to meeting these requirements. They can try to purchase subscribers or views but YouTube is good at identifying this. Trust me, I've gone down that road and have seen channels get taken down because of it.

&#x200B;

**Why is VMEO the best play here?**

The main reason is because businesses will leave YouTube.

Vimeo is hand-down my favorite video hosting service for a few reasons:

* The video encode quality is visibly better
* The embedded player is 100% customizable
* It's easier to pick thumbnails
* It has a built-in review system for businesses
* And the best feature, you can update videos without changing the URL (very helpful for embedding)

What's the drawback? It costs $7/month for most of these features. But businesses will gladly pay that to not have their competitors on their website/videos.

Positions: Shares 11 VMEO @ $43.25. I'll be loading up more soon."

2021-05-26 02:08:00,wallstreetbets,"From Forbes article
“Because Vimeo is that commercial-free, its videos are allowed on ad-supported outlets like Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest and Twitter. Being Ad-free is also vital for distribution on online retailers like Amazon, Etsy and Shopify. And Vimeo’s corporate clients don’t have to fret about random advertisements—or, worse, ones from competitors—appearing in the middle of their branded content. 

Companies like Deloitte, Pottery Barn, Rite Aid and Forbes use Vimeo to deliver training and onboarding videos in addition to livestreaming corporate events to employees now spread worldwide. Meanwhile, a million-plus smaller businesses use Vimeo to distribute advertising, product demos and how-to videos. Vimeo may have failed to launch its own streaming channel, but thousands of others—from indie filmmakers to Pilates instructors—use it to create subscription channels on streaming services such as Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV and Xbox.”


In other words:
- Vimeo is ad free and allowed on many platforms
- Vimeo’s corporate clients don’t have to worry about competitors running ads (as OP noted)
- Vimeo is used by large companies for livestreams
- Vimeo hosts many small businesses on many streaming services

2021-05-25 20:49:45,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for discussing this, although I disagree with your thesis. I just listened to Vimeo’s q1 earnings call and it seems to me they have no interest in competing with YouTube. The problem with Vimeo is they don’t really know who they are. I remember a few years ago they were trying to be some kind of indie on demand video company where filmmakers could sell their new releases. That didn’t work out I guess. Now they are trying to be an enterprise video tool...which seems like an okay business. But I’m not sold on it, the justification for their valuation seems to be some vague tools/products they will be introducing this year. The only one they really elaborated on was a form of DAM, which I don’t see being a very lucrative business. Livestream was a smart acquisition, but where are the results? Hope to buy some puts once they become available, assuming this thing doesn’t just drill all week."

Most people want to stop watching YouTube because of the ads but there has not been an alternative platform.  YouTube just incentivized content creators to go elsewhere - viewers will follow.

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Lumber prices..so what's next? Thoughts? Obviously the lumber prices have gone through roof which correlates to housing construction costs.  So how are people going to try to cut cost of building homes? Are they going to look for traditional alternatives to cut down on cost like brick/stucco/hardie/vinyl instead of a wood based exterior, tile instead of wood floors, etc. ??? Or is there other materials that can be used? I know we will still be using wood for most construction. At this time, lumber it is still the most cost efficient but who is to say someone doesn't discover a more cost efficient way. Personally I see brick being used more in new construction on single family homes.  

I am not an expert in this field by any stretch and not looking to give any financial advice. Just want to know what the community thinks.

Luxury vinyl looks more like wood than real wood unless you want to go to a very high end Canadian solid wood that coats $25/SF. Luxury vinyl is water-resistant, doesn't scratch and costs maybe $3/SF.

In Canada, most of our amazing lumber goes to Japan and the US. They're willing to pay a premium for our wood. We don't see that lumber in general here unfortunately. Been doing more composite decks. Can last decades. Hardie and Maibec are top choices for siding. Those don't seem to have stock issues. We also do steel framing mixed with wood for modular builds. It's worked out well.

2021-05-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Legalisation of marijuana is proceeding. Possibly TLRY (Tilray) will explode soon The US House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in the US. Thus, the banks would no longer operate illegal and unlawful financing should they offer loans and other services to the companies. That would be a huge step in removing what analysts are calling an obstacle to the development of a national cannabis industry.

Legislators voted for the bill with 321-101 votes and sent it to the Senate.

https://preview.redd.it/5mpqdo4tja171.jpg?width=660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1255ec4f5a2471772ca27ad86ea25c16167d241b

The bill clarifies that proceeds from legal cannabis deals are not considered illegal and instructs federal regulators to create rules on how they would oversee such banking activities. Banks have so far been unwilling to do business with companies that sell marijuana or related products, fearing they could run into conflict with US federal law. This has left marijuana companies with few options to rely on a handful of small financial institutions or do cash deals. The American Bankers Association has aggressively lobbied for the SAFE Banking Act bill.

The banks have been in a difficult position due to the conflict between state and federal law, so it makes sense that Congress must act now to resolve this conflict. Thirty-six US states have now legalized medical cannabis, while 17 states already allow recreational use of cannabis by adults.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would try to push legislation. The positive reaction of the stock prices of Tilray, Sundial Growers, Aphria or Aurora Cannabis shows the great relief of investors. Investors hope that this could have kicked off further progressive reforms in the cannabis sector. This move took the potential of a game-changing marijuana law an important step forward.

If Congress passes the SAFE Banking Act and President Joe Biden signs it, it would likely become much easier and cheaper for marijuana companies to raise the capital they need to fund their growth initiatives. The law should also make cannabis companies safer and more efficient, as credit services would reduce the need for cash in day-to-day operations.

Tilray's merger with Aphria paved the way for creating the world's largest cannabis company (by revenue). After checking out a lot about TLRY i was buying 1.170 Tilray-stocks today. I\`m sure this stock has really a lot of potential to explode completely."
2021-05-26 02:07:14,wallstreetbets,"Everybody who says that because it's canadian it won't thrive in the the US is a moron, because it's legal in canada the supply of weed has already been set up, for instance Tilray grows their weed in europe in extremely large quantities and imports it back to Canada, when US legalizes they will just have to import it to the US. US companies will have to setup the whole operation from scratch."

You guys should see ahead. There are e.g. the bundestag elections in Germany coming up in three months. The green party is leading with \~25% atm and they will likely decide whom they will build a coalition with. Legalization, which they propose ever since, might be in close reach. TLRY is a gamble, but this long play can take off in Europe furthermore.

TLRY will then partner up soon with a MSO to get a foot into the US market, not just sweetwater. That comes at a price for lower assets, but that is the game. A fusion is inevitable with their international market share and lagging legalization in the US."

There is a probability I will end up owning tilray stock in the long run which I don’t mind because if they want to come play in the US they’re going to have to pay and that will be in the form of acquiring the assets I currently own (us MSOs)....And that’s if they’re even allowed to come in which has been talked about, the possibility of not allowing big business or foreign actors into the marijuana industry, you can send me stupid ass messages comparing tilray, which is an individual stock trading on a major American exchange to an ETF that swaps out OTC pink sheet stocks (USA MSOs)... using 1/2 days of price action 😂So an educated person knows you’re comparing apples to oranges but you probably don’t even know that.

2021-05-26 08:14:43,wallstreetbets,You gotta take them gains. Don’t be a fool. You have done something incredible. Losing money from here will be way harder to then the feeling of making more money. Trust me.
2021-05-26 11:47:31,wallstreetbets,Sell and take profits
2021-05-25 20:03:24,wallstreetbets,How many people on here are full of shit?  Why do you say i turned 500k into 1.2M?  You made a 120% gain.  Great job.  How did you end up with 500k to throw into a high risk investment?  How many of you WSB folks are trust fund babies?  I just dont understand where you find the money to do this unless you were born with it or are one hell of an entrepreneur.  Very few folks on here are old enough to have accumulated that kind of wealth independently.
2021-05-25 20:01:23,wallstreetbets,Congratulations man. Not sure how much money you guys have to play bets like these. God bless you

2021-05-26 09:51:55,wallstreetbets,"That’s 100% return unfortunately if a person only have $1000 that wouldn’t be that much of a return. You guys put in these large amounts and look like you’re making a lot, with the average person can’t afford this."
2021-05-26 09:53:18,wallstreetbets,Also these must be the day and short term swing trades. Getting into an ETA for an extended period of time can bite you in the butt. They can decrease the value of them at will. I have experiences over many years of trading. Also I believe that people here should put what they were going to trade and why they are treating it. Instead of telling what they made afterwards. I don’t hear about all the losses typically.

2021-05-25 20:39:03,wallstreetbets,I **KNEW** Covid was coming - I was reading about it in China before it was making headlines here. I took a lot of money out at 28k DOW. I put some back in at 20k not expecting for the market to fully turn around from the government dumping money before the damn virus barely got started here. UGH. I mean I made a lot of money last year but not even near what could have been....

2021-05-25 23:52:08,wallstreetbets,"The last 10 years of the market have been insane. A few yolos without any effort and just some luck get you to this point. With some work and dedication and a solid decade bull run then you could do this with less yolos. 

In regards to this guy. He's retired after making his fortune on plays like these.

I never understand how a poster on WSBs which is all about high risk high reward plays.. can't fathom that some people actually win those bets."

How many decades ago did you last look at US tech job salaries? Finance, Management and many others also easily break you into ""retire after 5 years"" territory.

1. Make lots of money

2. Don't spend lots of money (here people generally fail to grasp that even absurd rents on west coast still leave you with mid 5 to 6 digits to invest. They just see ""omg 5k rent PER MONTH?!"" And shut down)

3. ???

4. Profit"

2021-05-25 23:41:24,wallstreetbets,Why is that?
2021-05-26 00:55:16,wallstreetbets,"This is not correct - while yes there is vol slippage/beta slippage/vol drag whatever you’d like to call it from the daily releveraging and negatives from the general high expense ratios of these funds, the long versions benefit from the upward drift nature in US markets. 
If I asked you what would have performed better since 1980 if you bought a 1.25x re-levered SP500 or bought the index at a 0% expense ratio, the upward drift nature has overrode the negative vol drag if you recreate the series ->  the 1.25x re-levered outperforms. This is to say, it’s not as simple as daily re-leverage is automatically a money loser in the long run, assuming a random walk with an upward drift 1x daily re-levered returns is not optimal and instead you should be re-leveraging (assuming a low enough cost of course on the leverage). Vol also matters here and like you mentioned lower vol regimes are better for the levered versions..."
2021-05-26 08:47:43,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so I would've gotten in at 55, it would've dropped to 17, and now it would be back at 101. I would've doubled my money?

But I agree with your positive outlook on the future of the company and SP. Just look at the current market cap - about $1.5B. That’s what the recent Amazon deal is worth BY ITSELF. And if you wanna talk about squeezes (albeit gamma), this thing moves on MINIMAL volume. All you would need is one major player/institution to start buying a couple million dollars worth of it in the morning and we’d be at $25 by lunch.

Additional natural gas as an alternative for commercial vehicles provides its own challenges with maintenance, range and power. It’s just not that great. I see a lot of investment going towards renewable diesel that can one to one replace existing diesel and be used in the existing vehicle park.

He recommended selling within the month (July 2017) and getting into 30y treasuries because of a looming 80% crash. SPY was around 2400 at the time, hardly higher than the 2300 March 2020 bottom.

The market wide effect it had last time was noticeable, and they stopped it from going all the way and then doubled down. Margin is going to go haywire in that possible event.

If you see ""the smart money"" all parroting the same line, take a minute to ask what that's about.

Remember at the bottom in spring 2020 that lots of smart money went on the record saying ""this fucker could go to zero!""

Bill Ackman swore up and down it was the end of the world, even as he was preparing to buy.

90% of market news is an attempt to spook weak hands. And most of the remaining 10% is intended to scare the government into not taking certain actions.

Gee. Who thinks the richies are trying to scare the government into not hiking taxes?

I do.

Based on the paramount responsibility of government to appear solvent (The fiat USD's trust comes from the citizens (public's) ability to pay it's debts (gov loans))... they can not raise rates. They can print more money to monetize new gov bond issuance... which is what they will likely do. Print enough to get inflation high enough where the increase in inflation is more than increase in gov borrowing, by so eventually stabilizing US Gov debt to GDP ratio back to 40% or so... which means 10-20% inflation for at least 10 years."

2021-05-25 20:51:26,wallstreetbets,"Looking back at history, an increase in minimum wages has only a very weak association with inflationary pressures. Sure, the theory of it makes in theory, but in reality, fast food businesses will just lower their workforce, and may benefit from heightened productivity. In fact, small minimum wage increases (5-15%) might actually lead to lower prices.

In a similar way, the increase in wages these companies offer will most likely not have the effect that you predict, since in practice, the economy is just not that simple."
2021-05-25 21:30:21,wallstreetbets,Sounds like they will need to accept lower rates of profit while figuring out a way to increase the productivity of labor. This type of inflation is just unwillingness of owners to rebalance how revenue is distributed.

2021-05-25 22:02:06,wallstreetbets,"It literally took 25 years for the 1929 peak to be surpassed. Also languished for 15 - 20 years from the late 60s to early 80s.

You dumb and need to look at a long term chart of the Dow. You've been alive through the best stock market and bond market in history via financial engineering since the early 80s to today. Don't let that recent history bias your long term outlook on stocks. They've been considered dead money for decades at a time in the last 100 years and there's no reason to think that can't repeat itself, now, soon, or in 10 - 20 years.. Eventually there will be a secular bear market again. And it'll hurt anyone who hold through it very severely."

2021-05-25 23:41:27,wallstreetbets,"Boomers don’t necessarily pay off their mortgage. Even if your boomer parents just died and left you their house, you would not enjoy inheriting a house that has $470,000 remaining on the mortgage with a market value of $350,000. 

That means you’d have to write the bank a check for $120,000 if you wanted to sell it.

(High interest rates decrease house prices.)"
2021-05-26 11:14:17,wallstreetbets,"A global pandemic is a known risk. That's why we've been preparing for one for the better part of a decade. What couldn't have been known, is that we'd have a president throw the plan out the window and deny reality. 

The USD crashing and hyper inflating would destroy the entire global economy. It wouldn't make sense either because the us citizen is still the highest GDP per capita and the wealthiest consumers in the world. Inflation in the USD would probably drag all other global currencies up with it."

2021-05-25 23:38:20,wallstreetbets,Your dumb. Ya stocks were dead for decades and I’ll tell you why that won’t happen again. The 401k.  Started in 1978 it’s government enforced stock buying for the masses.  Look at a market chart from 1978 to now and you’ll see it’s only been a bull run.  80s were boomin.  It’s continual upward pressure in stocks that even the biggest dips recover quickly from. I don’t think a prolonged bear market is possible.
2021-05-26 06:58:20,wallstreetbets,"That's neoliberalism in a nutshell. The days of american central planning for the future ended in the 80s.

2021-05-26 07:09:46,wallstreetbets,"...50 year time horizon, and government sluts it up with monopolies right now. So I gotta wait and see for now. Not to mention even with world depopulating, the US has been stemming this with immigration so isolated countries may be affected more or less. Still if China goes down they could pull the US with them potentially. Depopulation means the worlds biggest exporter sees less buying, and deflation means US deficit is huge. 

I can see it happening but how it will play out specifically will be tricky."
2021-05-25 22:26:55,wallstreetbets,I don’t know if that’s true now. I own a small construction business and starting wages are up 50%+ in the last prob 7 years.

2021-05-25 22:03:28,wallstreetbets,"Algos work both ways. Look at China's collapse in 2015/2016 markets... Algos destroyed that shit. Fed saved the algos from going full bear right at a critical level. They knew exactly what they were doing announcing infinite QE when they did, another down week and the algos would still be selling to this day."
2021-05-26 01:07:28,wallstreetbets,"Robots and AI ain't taking over shit, they'll just be used to make work more about humanity's strong suits. 

Every tech innovation creates novel jobs that only people can do. Alexa's a fucking moron, anyway.

Edit: no, seriously. The ""technology is gonna take our jerbs!"" nonsense probably started with the invention of the wheel.

""This wheel will put the log rollers out of business!!!"""
2021-05-25 23:35:54,wallstreetbets,"I think tech and AI will have a deflationary impact, but it won’t outweigh increasing consumer participation.

It doesn’t make sense to look at the global population as an unmodified number of human beings walking around. There could be 1 billion humans on the moon but if they don’t buy much stuff from earth then they aren’t impacting the global economy. Right now there are billions of people in poverty who don’t really participate in the global economy.

Look at China. There’s a huge gap between rent prices in big cities versus the countryside. People in Shanghai participate in the global economy. They pay $700+ per month in rent. People in the Chinese countryside pay $10,000 to buy a house. You could probably rent one for $50 a month. There’s a massive gap in wages and cost of living. Every year tens of millions of people move from rural China to a city.

That’s what I think will happen in India and Africa over the rest of my lifetime.

AI will impact the economies of developed countries first but it won’t hit the developing world for a while. There are billions of people who don’t have cell phones yet. Their bosses might have cell phones but probably don’t have computers. How can AI take their job if there’s no computer for it to run on?"

2021-05-25 21:58:05,wallstreetbets,"I'd say with a Fed gone full retard, 10 - 20% in gold/silver investments and other commodities is prudent. I'm not saying all physical, that's dumb, that's 5% tops, but some mining stocks and perhaps a silver ETF like PSLV would be good to have for the next few years, just in case. Personally I have 5% in silver at home and 5% in GDX and 2.5% in SIL and 5% in URA. The silver at home isn't to barter in some post apocalyptic hellscape, it is to get through potential short term crisis in which banks may limit withdrawals and bartering does become necessary for a short time to survive.

If the apocalypse happens, I have a gun, and its not to fight others, its to blow my fucking brains out. Fuck surviving in a world like ""The Road"" portrays."

2021-05-25 23:16:50,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn’t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn’t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn’t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn’t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I’ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger."

2021-05-26 05:59:00,wallstreetbets,Checked Wallstreetzen and bought that dip around $23. Financials are solid and the analyst forecasts are Aladeen.
2021-05-26 00:29:26,wallstreetbets,"nothing clever here, i lost SO MUCH MONEY on expi"
2021-05-26 06:35:01,wallstreetbets,isnt that how most of these businesses work? there is a total amount of commission that is split based on rank(with a part going to the company) no?
2021-05-26 10:00:12,wallstreetbets,Yeah doing well today! Solid buy at 23.
2021-05-26 09:59:30,wallstreetbets,Well it's doing good today
2021-05-26 09:19:39,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure what your work history is and I mean no offence. But this company puts up a lot of red flags. As previously noted, they focus primarily on recruitment. The training offered to their agents is heavily influenced towards selling the company to potential agents vs selling houses. I'm not sure how accurate the 10 leads a day thing was, but I have seen similar stories on r/antimlm. Any reputable company would focus on the growth and development of their employees and products/services, but EXP seems to be more concerned with getting bodies through the door."
2021-05-26 10:51:21,wallstreetbets,that makes sense and is different from the type of business that i had in mind(one that is focused on selling houses/aquiring customers and the compensation works based on the abovementioned system)
2021-05-25 21:43:19,wallstreetbets,They're dropping their bags on you.
2021-05-26 12:22:25,wallstreetbets,woof that's a short time window
2021-05-26 13:57:50,wallstreetbets,COIN is a long term hold.
2021-05-25 20:47:39,wallstreetbets,"Direct listing is a liquidity event. Insiders were the only ones with shares to offer, if they didn’t sell then there would be nobody for retail investors to buy shares from. But this time it still played out badly for first day buyers."

To be clear I’m not retarded enough to buy this shit, but it has some strong points."
2021-05-26 04:47:59,wallstreetbets,Ouch. Hopefully you can break even eventually.

2021-05-25 23:28:05,wallstreetbets,I know nothing about stock trading. I don't wanna know. I don't really care. I don't want to do any research. I do have a lot of extra money from being locked down in Ontario (no happy hour drinks). So I'm buying more GME. Waka waka!

2021-05-26 08:53:55,wallstreetbets,I have 15 shares gme at $297. Holding until the hedge funds have completely collapsed. They have been screwing people like us all all lives. Time for them to feel the financial pain we have suffered our whole lives.
2021-05-26 09:47:37,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I shared your post but didn’t comment here. Your DD looked good and fucking hell, you may have been right!"
2021-05-26 09:50:16,wallstreetbets,Been holding since February. What are we thinking the price will reach?
2021-05-26 11:17:55,wallstreetbets,I agree although I use reversals and energy to guide me I have reached the same conclusion. There is a huge void between 233 and 283 and large voids above that with little resistance. We should be up to 283 pretty smoothly after safely clearing 233 which we seem to have done. This stonk has loads of energy too. It ain't running out anytime soon. If we can keep up the energy then expect to pass the previous high in a week or two. Keep the energy up GME

Anybody out there do orthodox REAL short selling?  No \[stupid\] puts?  Some ""funny"" things going on: shorting for small fry for FREE; hard-to-borrow charges that suddenly disappear.  Maybe your broker did a naked short for you but didn't tell you.  A broker's supposed to make ""best efforts"" to ""locate"" shares for you. So he gets your order to short looks up at the ceiling and doesn't see 50 GME so he does a naked short but doesn't tell you.  OK so I've made 6249 bucks so far shorting GME four times.  Am I game for a fifth? I want to make enough to buy GME to hold.  What did the Aftermarket close at at 8pm?"

Only holding 3 shares lol. Just curious what the actual potential of this is."
2021-05-26 14:12:07,wallstreetbets,The crazy thing about this is if this much volume has to move to only move this thing 120 bucks or so then we have a problem either these fucks are continuing to make fake stock or someone is selling a whole bunch at a very cheap price!

2021-05-25 22:56:18,wallstreetbets,I bought late and had to eat a >50% loss selling last week. I crashed it when I bought in January and set off the rocket when I sold last week. What's worse is that I sold to help my MIL and this week I was able to pull 3x more out of my ass. Of course as soon as the money hit my account I went to buy back GME and saw it at $215 and I shit my pants in anger.

2021-05-26 10:01:39,wallstreetbets,"At this point, I have made more money than I paid for my shares selling covered calls. So why I am sad I will probably not get these big sexy gains, I own my shares for free and if I am forced to sell it will still be for a nice profit."
2021-05-25 21:19:24,wallstreetbets,They will take your shares at 15. Hopefully your avg cost on the shares were below 15
2021-05-26 10:04:13,wallstreetbets,"Are you selling the CC? Or you bought a call?

If you are selling the CC, and it gets exercised, then you have to sell 100 shares of AMC at $15/share. If you own the shares for less than $15, your only real exposure is that you will not get any gains <$15/share.

So right now, I have a bunch of calls I sold at $16/share. If the price point is still <$16 on the exercise date (here 6/11), then I will be forced to sell my shares for $16/share, regardless of current value. So if they are, say, $30/share... then I will not make any of that money. Big bummer, but I win either way.

Make sense?

edit: and if you DO NOT own the shares, then you're fucked. Thats not a covered call, that's a naked call. Meaning, you will be forced to buy 100 (times however many contracts yous old) shares for whatever the current market value is, and sell them at $15/share."
2021-05-26 11:06:22,wallstreetbets,Brother we’ve hit 18 I can smell that 300 already
2021-05-26 12:06:57,wallstreetbets,Thanks!!
2021-05-25 21:58:58,wallstreetbets,"I'm asking how to close a position to maximize profit, I understand the basic of a cc , just not when it is ideal to close them and take profit to open a new one."
2021-05-25 22:02:22,wallstreetbets,"Avg is below 15, no worries about that.

Just asking to see what does the play of closing 14c means, from my understanding to close an early CC you would want the premium to have dropped below the price you sold it for to pocket profit. 

But how did he pocket from closing 14c, AMC kept shooting up so when did he had time to pocket on the  the IV to close the cc to open a new one ?"
2021-05-26 13:02:32,wallstreetbets,I'd like to see atleast 25 by the end of the week
2021-05-26 11:52:53,wallstreetbets,You have to buy to open the same contract and pay the difference I believe
2021-05-25 20:01:40,wallstreetbets,"BB.... its every analysts whipping post.  BB does well.... analysts hate it.  BB does terrible.... analysts hate it.  BB holds 38,000 patents....analysts hate it.  BB partners with some of the biggest tech platforms...... yup.....analysts hate that too..... BB drops...analysts say "" see .... that stock is brutal""  BB shoots up.... analysts say...."" it'll never last""  

Mr 26 year old analysts working for some s$%t azz bank or brokerage living in his mommas basement with a bargain basement suit like Bud Fox meeting Gordon Gekko for the first time.... he's the miserable POS that makes every amateur day trader bite his nails every time something comes out about BB.....but what they dont realize is that that crappy suit analyst just doesn;t want to like BB.  Its everyone favourite stock they love to hate!

I own lots of BB.  Got it in March/April of 2020 when it was a bargain.  Why did I buy BB.  Because I LOVE THIS STOCK!  WHY???? because it actually has strong fundamentals.  Its a good company run by an incredibly smart CEO that sees the future of the company.  I honestly think that some of these cheap suit analysts think that BB still sells phones!!

&#x200B;

NEWS FLASH CHEAP SUIT GUYS

&#x200B;

THEY DON'T!!!!

But I digress!  

So!  I love this stock.  I;m going to hold on to it forever!  HELL..... I'll probably buy more of it.... why wouldn't I?  Unlike that 26 year old ramen eating cheap suit mommas boy..... I know more about this stock than him.  And its going to ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)  With or without cheap suit boy!"

2021-05-26 00:42:11,wallstreetbets,I LIVED IN REGRET when GME took off to the moon. Every day that passed..I wished..I should’ve..but not this time. I just applied for a loan and I will put EVERYTHING into BBI refuse to live in regrets!
2021-05-25 23:47:15,wallstreetbets,It’s going to go all the way to $0 obviously because trends last forever. Especially trends caused by a catalyst that fucked with the stocks price movement drastically
2021-05-26 02:22:22,wallstreetbets,"Amazon 50/50, 60% EV market, Cyber security is hot right now, IVY, QNX, Papa Chen, Patent Sales..  I’m beyond bullish"
2021-05-26 15:52:29,wallstreetbets,"Very relevant to BB price movement today lol. Usually sell CC's around $10, maybe a bit higher but never lower, just depends on premium. As for expiration, that's really dependent on you and what sort of premium you would like vs odds of getting assigned. I just sold 5 CC's today with its rally upwards for Jun 18 because I don't expect them to be in the money on that date, but if they are, that's a decent profit for me and the premium of like almost $300 is nice."
2021-05-26 11:06:15,wallstreetbets,Who applies for a loan to put into ANY stock?  WTF?  Get your priorities down bro.
2021-05-25 20:23:47,wallstreetbets,Wow. Love the confidence!good luck!
2021-05-26 09:24:31,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-05-25 20:24:51,wallstreetbets,Thanks! I’ve only grabbed a few shares so far. Thinking of adding. Not sure if this is a good entry point.
2021-05-26 16:11:42,wallstreetbets,"I actually bought a bunch of shares and sold calls. Some at the money 9.5c 6/18. Some Jan 2022 15c (so I can participate in a run). 

My thinking was the super high premiums actually help bring my purchase price down. And if they get called away, I make a really good annual yield for 3 weeks of time. 

I hope I didn’t f it all up. But at the end of the day, I’m happy to hold shares and sell cc. I have 100 shares that I bought for an average of 8.70 or so that I won’t cc.

Edit: what strike did you sell for today? 10c again? I also sold a 12c 7/16 delta was around 30 which is what people say to sell at for thetagang. Went from 65 shares to 800 today lol. I have been watching it for a while. My backup is just a long term hold. It seems like it is heading in the right direction."
2021-05-25 20:33:38,wallstreetbets,Absolutely! I'm in for the long haul! BB will come
2021-05-25 20:53:59,wallstreetbets,"I've averaged down from I think 19 a share down to 11 a share. This is cheap, and will add more but focusing on future calls"
2021-05-26 16:52:39,wallstreetbets,"More 10c's today. Liked the premium and I'd be okay with selling at that price if assigned. What's the point of delta being at 30? Good decay that way?

Edit: I also sold off what I had in my WeBull account which was 116 @ 8.02 since I decided I could use that profit to pay for gas and credit card bill lmao"
2021-05-26 09:24:09,wallstreetbets,Thanks.
2021-05-26 17:57:39,wallstreetbets,The thetagang people say a 30 delta and a 30-45 dte gives them good chances of profiting. And time to adjust/roll as necessary. Definitely enjoy selling options instead of chasing and having options expire worthless lol.
2021-05-26 19:44:58,wallstreetbets,"Same, especially when I have a position like BB where it's basically half my portfolio."
2021-05-26 19:47:56,wallstreetbets,So much more relaxing knowing time is my friend. Use to stress so much watching my options being OTM and just evaporating over time. I know I repeated myself lol.

2021-05-26 00:01:37,wallstreetbets,Half the time he lost you money in a week and usually lost you money in a month. It's a smart play to inverse him on non-short term calls.
2021-05-26 00:02:17,wallstreetbets,Fair.
2021-05-25 21:23:54,wallstreetbets,Previous post he played 1.5 hrs and made 6k before this

Either way congrats and fuck you!"
2021-05-26 06:28:14,wallstreetbets,Good shit
2021-05-25 23:58:03,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily,  there's no compulsion to let the option exppire worthless. He can sell it before expiration to adjust the risk"
2021-05-26 06:29:39,wallstreetbets,Not really if you intraday
2021-05-25 22:42:15,wallstreetbets,"It's 14% in five minutes, which is different"
2021-05-25 23:20:07,wallstreetbets,Bruh! You gotta have atleast $898 to sit at the table or no soup for you. Far from a FD and 14% is nowhere close to a 2 bagger
2021-05-25 22:14:37,wallstreetbets,"Dude Tsla had like one red tick for this to be up 6k. Imagine if Tesla went up 5%, dude would've lost way more than just 6k. Its literally asymetrical to the downside, making the position certified *RETARDED*"

Wasn't able to start saving, let alone investing, until nearly 50. Ok, that's a bit late, and I recommend aiming a bit higher than that. But it was fine. Keep your eye on the ball but don't stress about it before you actually need to."

2021-05-25 22:05:00,wallstreetbets,I sold a 200 call Monday at 5.80 thinking GME would just dick around all week like usual. Debating whether to give the buyer the shares or take the loss.
2021-05-25 22:39:19,wallstreetbets,"Pk yall i am a COMPLETE noob, so guide me wise ones"
2021-05-25 23:33:33,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain why he is still negative on the strike 300s? Is this the theta decay thing?
2021-05-26 00:16:55,wallstreetbets,Hello quick question I am new I have a call for AMC that I bought in feb for Jan 2022 break even 14.20 should I excersice the contract or ride out
2021-05-26 04:44:12,wallstreetbets,"Sell when you see profits, not when Theta decay hits"
2021-05-26 06:51:19,wallstreetbets,better to exercise the option or to take the money and buy further options for down the line?

2021-05-25 22:58:19,wallstreetbets,Honestly shares are a much safer bet than options. GME is a great long-term play IMO even if you take the short squeeze off the table.
2021-05-25 23:35:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah I bought those yesterday. As of end of day today theyre worth double what I paid for them.
2021-05-25 20:21:51,wallstreetbets,Can’t we post about GME to the moon anymore???
2021-05-25 20:31:11,wallstreetbets,Dude I talked with you so often about gamestop Mr gasolinepizza. Every time you talk crap about gme.

2021-05-26 06:48:48,wallstreetbets,TL;DR. Next.
2021-05-26 13:16:42,wallstreetbets,You bring up some good points many people wouldn't want to listen to. Other stock groups will probably be more receptive to your message
2021-05-26 08:13:51,wallstreetbets,Why
2021-05-26 05:48:03,wallstreetbets,"You people need to stop demonizing shorts, dude. Shorting is exactly the same as longing. There is no “potentially infinite loss” unless you are really, really, (and I mean, really) retarded, such as shorting something like a 0.30 dollar Biotech penny stock and then it discover the cure for cancer or some shit like that. This actually happened to some guys when that guy Martin Schkreli bought a penny biotech on the verge of bankruptcy and went from 0.10 to like 8 dollars, but again, people who short that kind of stuff are waiting for a catastrophe to happen. 

I always, routinely short “normal” stocks because it’s actually much safer to be hedged (so I long X finance stock and short another Y finance stock). This way I’m market neutral and I don’t care if everything goes to shit, which actually reduces my risk. 

There’s also a thing called “stop losses”, which I know many of you here don’t even know what they are, but you always use stop losses when shorting, as easy as that. Many times my short has gone south (it’s a normal part of trading, even a 55-60% winrate can be pretty decent for example) and I just take my loss. Unless there is an extreme squeeze event (such as Volkswagen or something crazy like that), you always get filled close to the SL price.

TLDR: you are pretty retarded if you think shorting automatically incurs on infinite losses, lmao. If you are wrong on your puts you usually lose all your money, so it HAS to get close to your strike price or it ends up worthless. With shorting you just need it to go down, even a small amount."
2021-05-26 08:14:46,wallstreetbets,"You wrote a novel and I’m not going to read it.

What can happen to short sellers should be pretty fucking obvious based on the state of this sub for the last six months. GME went from $10 to $400, and a bunch of professionals lost their shirts short selling it."
2021-05-26 08:16:56,wallstreetbets,"Well, if you can’t read it’s not really my problem, but hey, low education bar 🤣

GME is one in a million and even then THERE ARE STOP LOSSES lol

If you don’t wanna educate yourself and keep losing all your money, be my guest! Ignorance is pretty amusing to watch always :)"
2021-05-26 08:20:28,wallstreetbets,"You’re an idiot. Go sell some calls

Edit: I see you just started trading a few months ago. You’ve got a lot to learn, boy"
2021-05-26 08:39:42,wallstreetbets,"You seem like a fucking idiot tho. Like, who the fuck would not want to learn how to short?

2021-05-26 15:14:55,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm, interesting, I’m a PharmD and we sometimes do behavioural research, and you definitely fit into one of our archetypes. When people pay attention to other people’s hobbies they either:

1) Don’t have any of their own
2) Are extremely and utterly insecure and/or have been bullied hardcore
3) Are really lonely people
4) Have trouble making meaningful connections to other people and/or be respected. 

Your kind also usually has a high degree of social anxiety (you probably have trouble speaking to people, etc.), few friends, and your parents have either been harsh or neglected you.

Compounding to this, your username is also very interesting because it’s very specifically “not a neckbeard”, which completely implies that you are one, but have trouble admitting it and thus try to “hate it” (common human response similar to why most homophobic people are actually gay) cause it’s not “cool”. It’s similar to you hating Pokemon or similar things not deemed “manly” enough - you also probably play shooters or similar things to reaffirm your (probably) lacking masculinity, it’s also a frequent mechanism of defense. 

Getting close, huh? 🤣Yeah, that’s why you don’t put these kind of comments unless you are ok getting completely trainwrecked, lol.

It brings in money up until the time it doesn't and then it will fall apart like a house of cards. Even with their business model they have yet to turn an actual profit.   We are coming due for a market correction in housing based on historical trends and the inevitable rise in mortgage rates.  Houses are significantly heavier bags to hold than stocks and not nearly as liquid.

There is a wide array of RE agents cause of the low barrier to entry, but a good agent is amazing compared to anything else.

“If they advertised less storage people like you would buy the one that claims to have more despite the fact that they are the same”

what????

if I’m buying an iphone and only an iphone, it doesn’t matter. it’s still fucked if you buy a phone that has 16gb capacity advertised and only get 12, still just as fucked if you buy a 64gb iphone and only get 60. if i want more storage i will buy more storage, i’m buying an iphone. the issue is how much free storage you actually have. my free space should be 64gb if you advertised it as 64gb. what is “the reason they have to advertise like that”? what are you talking about? lol stop simping for corporations, you look silly. 

it would be understandable on a 256gb computer that the OS takes up some space. but if you buy a 16gb iphone and the OS takes up 25% of your storage, that’s fucked."
2021-05-25 20:42:45,wallstreetbets,The second another phone tells you they have 12gb of storage you'll buy the one that says 16 and complain.

This doesn’t mean i wouldn’t like my taxes to be better managed. About rich people, i think is even worst as they have more money to “afford” paying.

Valuations, PE ratios, and market cap will sooner or later matter. No one will pay $500k for quarter or a million for a popsicle stick, because those things are easily valued by laymen (we know a quarter is about $0.25 and a popsicle stick is maybe $2)

A 600PE ratio like Tesla means it'll take 600 years of revenue to break even.
A non existent PE ratio like AMC means they spend more money than they make right now.

Some companies honestly deserve to be bankrupt. Their CEOs are still taking in million dollar paychecks and pay their workers minimum wage.

AMC and some companies are like a lemonade stand that costs $25/yr to run but only sells $5 worth of lemonade per year, and for some reason you the neighbor is willing to buy it for $35. Oh and the stand owes $100 of debt, so you gotta pay that off once you buy the lemonade stand from the original owner.

Is this lemonade stand worth $35?

The above example is roughly how AMCs accounting looks like when you look at it's PE, PS, PB ratios."

I think it's late now too, if you didn't get in at $30 it won't be as profitable and you might get burned, but tbh, if the $30c for July drops to $4.00 entry, I think that's when you should buy in. But that's just my opinion."

2021-05-26 15:30:14,wallstreetbets,"$Ride is up 5% Today. 

Seems people only look at bad news and report on it, there's more good than bad:

The good:

- Betas on track

- Production still expected in Sept. 

- 5 Star crash ratings expected

- Working on Van

- Not chip constrained this year

- Brought Frame in house (Cost $$ now, saves in future)

- Brought Batteries in house (Cost $$ now, saves in future)

- Converting pre-orders to purchase agreements (@23k) 


Did any news outlet report on that? No... they reported on --> 

The Bad:

- COVID put strain on supply chain, they needed to spend more for parts (and brought some aspects in house to save in the future)

- Need more funding to meet 2021 production goals of 2200; without funding ~1000. 


But, most reports didn't actually explain why they needed more money nor that the production goal cut by 50% was only if they didn't secure more funding. 

All the bad are within reason for a new company, and the only real downside is if they cannot secure additional funding to meet their goals. They seemed to have no doubt they would be able to secure the funding; while ATVM  is a plus, it's not their only funding option."

It’ll hit $500 way before it hits $950 and if you’re right and it does hit $950, the $950 calls may be worth $100 depending on time left but the $500’s would be trading at almost $500 a 15 bagger vs a double"

Also, Jan 2022 is less than a year away. Lower tax bracket for tendies if I stick with the 2023 calls. 

Now I can just hang back and watch GameStop's valuation reach what it's actually gonna be worth in the next year and a half (we'll over $1,000/share pre-split I think)

Also, by the time $950 is only worth $100 would be WELL after Jan 2022 lol. If it hits $950 before Jan 2022, these are gonna be worth a whole shitload more than $100."

Even if they converted their stores to large arcades where you can go and pay $$?? to play all day.
2021-05-26 15:08:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, and Amazon wasn't worth $3,000 when Bezos was operating out of a garage.

Youre looking at the history of GameStop. Not the future.

It's a brand new company with all new leadership (top people cherry picked from other companies, at that).

Literally if this weren't attached to the name ""GameStop"" but was a brand new IPO with these people at the helm, in an explosively lucrative industry like gaming, everyone (and I mean *every*one would be singing a different tune).

Edit: also, sounds like you should short it. 40 years experience right? Don't let that go to waste. Trust your research and make a move. That's what I'm doing."
2021-05-26 10:44:21,wallstreetbets,"Going long GME is easy when the price is so damn low.

Also, I'm comparing a company with no more competitors than the others had to deal with to those same giants when they were smaller.

2021-05-26 19:29:04,wallstreetbets,"Differing experiences and less rudeness.  So you’ve had an extremely good run in GME that doesn’t make u knowledgeable and beside all I said was to reduce your risk by reducing your strike price, I wish in some way I could book that trade and make the money rather than a market maker somewhere.  Take care"
2021-05-26 12:48:29,wallstreetbets,"Hey, you were right on the IV play at the extra time to see it play out! Just faster gains than expected.

The cool part is that if the stock DOES pop up these next couple of weeks, we'll be looking at inflated IV + loong Theta + (if it goes crazy high) Intrinsic value.

I've secured my initial investment already. The rest is pure profit (even if they go to zero, which would take a year and a half anyway).

Makes holding my shares much more relaxing, that's for sure!"
2021-05-26 19:59:44,wallstreetbets,"You have said a whole lot more than ""reduce your strike price to reduce your risk"" during this conversation. Made a lot of highly bearish speculations on something you seem unwilling to admit you have no idea about.

To be clear, I've been investing well before GME, and turned a nice $40K profit (from a $35K account base) on my December to January moves before jumping into GME.

Appreciate the condiscending attitude though.

Take care as well, my friend."
2021-05-26 12:19:45,wallstreetbets,A PE ratio of 100 is complete arbitrary lol. You can justify their PE ratio if you consider their expected EPS growth over the next 5 years. They have a PEG of about 3 which isn't isn't that absurd.
2021-05-26 17:15:55,wallstreetbets,"A PEG ratio of 3 is extremely overvalued by dude. A PEG ratio above 1 is generally seen as unfavourably high. Apple's is 1.57.

Also, Tesla's PEG ratio is 3.45, so it's even more overvalued than you stated.  


Aside, ""expected EPS"" growth... ""expected"" by who? We're back into baseless speculation now. The fact is that Tesla today, is absurdly overvalued based on the fundementals. Even with extremely optimistic predictions, the price is not justified."
2021-05-26 17:28:13,wallstreetbets,"Relative to a PE ratio of 611x a peg ratio of 3.45 is cheap. It means that teslas earnings growth is expected to be almost 200%. If investors actually believe that, and tesla teases they can achieve it, then their price is about to skyrocket, much less pull back. The market is driven by the expectations of investors, not current fundamentals."
2021-05-26 17:34:06,wallstreetbets,"Relative to a kick in the balls, a punch in the face isn't so bad. Jesus, do whatever you like pal, good luck in the market if this is your logic."
2021-05-25 23:52:15,wallstreetbets,"Cool, justify diversification. Please tell me why I should buy stocks I like less because they are different. It's retarded. You like a company at a certain price you buy it. You don't go around buying stocks just so you can have different stocks. It's dumb."
2021-05-26 17:46:38,wallstreetbets,You should short tesla with that confidence.
2021-05-25 23:55:43,wallstreetbets,"The point is that you find multiple you like, not to put your money into ones you don’t simply for the sake of diversification.

If you truly do not like other companies in any sector, wtf is wrong with you? Especially with something this volatile"
2021-05-25 23:58:34,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you find multiple you like. Maybe you don't. Ultimately you are buying a portion of the profits of a company. If you can get it at a better value than you can anything else than but it. 

At the same time, I wouldn't fault you if your portfolio was 100% fb. There is no better value."
2021-05-26 11:37:00,wallstreetbets,"Because actual finance professionals think in terms of returns per unit of risk and their main goal is to maximize returns while minimizing risk. No one gives a fuck if you made a 3,000% return when your dumbass yolos it all on one stock and loses it the next day."
2021-05-26 00:28:37,wallstreetbets,It’s to cover your ass homie
2021-05-26 12:20:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm not talking about yoloing on meme stocks and I'm not talking a out a 3,000% return. I'm talking about doing 30-50% per year. I'm in my late 20s I'm not risk averse. I make a little bit more money than I spend. I could save and invest into a diversified account and get 10% yearly gains but I just think it is dumb when I can buy facebook stock. It's not like they are going to start losing money. I'm not investing hundreds of thousands. I have 20-30k right now. Diversification makes no sense. I have 3 positions I'm hiding long term."
2021-05-26 12:28:42,wallstreetbets,I know you intuitively understand the benefits of diversification because you bought 3 stocks and not one. The point is that you have company specific and market specific risk and you want to eliminate company specific risk. The only risk you should have in your portfolio is systemic and you can easily achieve that by indexing the core of your portfolio.
2021-05-26 12:22:56,wallstreetbets,"I'm up over 100% in the last year using indexed ETFs, a handful of quality picks and margin, not sure what point you're trying to make. But that's only because of the pandemic. You will never achieve a consistent 30% YoY return regardless of your strategy."

The problem is that inflation wouldn't go up and eventually they put the interest rate to negative! That means that you would get interest if you borrow money. That way we became the laughing stock of the world. Now most Swedes have big loans cause it is so cheap. If the interest rates go up people will have big problems.

And all of this because the goal of having inflation when you don't have it..."

2021-05-26 02:12:57,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, kind of drunk. Bear with me. 

What I mean is ""if you are assuming shit goes sideways and the report is going to be bad"" -> thus stock will tank -> therefore buy puts ahead of time to profit from that.

Only problem is that in the run up to earnings, IV will be going up due to uncertainty, so the price of the puts will be going up too. 

So even if you're correct and the earnings are garbage and the stock drops, IV will tank too because the uncertainty is resolved, so the price of the puts will be negatively impacted because of vega.

So what is the best time to buy to minimize IV crush (which is something calls get equally fucked by too, if you happen to believe the report will be good and the stock will go up)"

2021-05-25 22:21:56,wallstreetbets,"Slight gain last week but pretty much eaten up by commissions....  we shall see how tomorrow plays out.   Was worried about a total write off for this week since I bought low but the massive gain for AMC has always been precipitated by a massive sell off.  So feeling a lot better about a moonshot now than if the price consolidated for the next two days.  We are past the max price 52 target by the most bullish analyst of $16 and the institutional investors that are still in AMC might all dump tomorrow, which would be massive amount shares selling off tomorrow.

Will be interesting to see how it plays out this week.  If it really squeezes tomorrow or Thursday could spark a stampede for the exits and that’s where the puts pay off big.  We hit $20, just as likely there will be a pullback to $5-6 as there will be an increase to $30 in the span of a day."

2021-05-26 07:12:25,wallstreetbets,"Haha, thanks for reminding me.

2021-05-26 05:30:12,wallstreetbets,"I was running a play on spce when it got volume at the open for a break out.  It failed, but it stayed strong even when the market went down, so staying in one more day.  Aiming for 27.50 or a break out above that.  Most likely I'll probably take a 30 dollar loss per contract or break even at the open.

If i wasnt tired/sleepy, i probably would of scanned the market and it should of hit on the momo scanner and got in on AMC at 14.50 break out.  But when your sleepy, its better to just focus on one play.  Played the SPY for a mean reversal and rejection at 420 mark.  But only because I watch spy for every play im in, unless its a dow stock, then I focus on the dow to see what its doing.  So basically a break even day for me.  Small loss on spce and small gain on spy for couple hundred bucks."
2021-05-25 23:21:53,wallstreetbets,Oh that’s not too bad. I thought you lost way more.
2021-05-26 17:10:36,wallstreetbets,"Good for you dude!

But could have been a nice loss porn!"
2021-05-26 15:48:12,wallstreetbets,That is about the best case scenario with this movement. This could have gotten out of control really quickly.
2021-05-26 10:07:52,wallstreetbets,Margin called! And also closed out everything else for a total of 3k loss.
2021-05-25 23:18:43,wallstreetbets,"Mr. Margin Call came and closed off half my open positions even though they are all OTM for a $300 realized loss.

Currently sitting on about $400 unrealized loss because I YOLO-ed and sold more naked calls after getting margin called of course. 

As shown by the notification above, I will likely get margin called again if AMC goes up another 5%

2021-05-26 03:55:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I would definitely get ripped a new one if I didn't manually close off some positions beforehand, especially the 16s. Well, I'm lucky once, not gonna try this anymore once I'm done with these 🤞"
2021-05-26 00:02:14,wallstreetbets,"Well... I guess I will cheer for you. 5% is possible, but I doubt it will run much higher than that. Who knows though. You (and me) will find out tomorrow."
2021-05-26 12:35:12,wallstreetbets,Guess I was wrong about the 5%. You should be flipping puts or calls intraday instead.
2021-05-26 01:21:51,wallstreetbets,I dont understand how people can risk their future for so little money. Obscenely stupid
2021-05-26 02:55:45,wallstreetbets,"Go figure, mate."

2021-05-26 06:14:13,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity isn’t all it’s hyped up to be... I made $284k on the first GME squeeze and $45k on the second... Fidelity fucked me during the second squeeze.

You’re fine on RH. Don’t sweat it"
2021-05-26 12:25:12,wallstreetbets,"> That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages exploded. However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up.

I don't know, I think there is an actual labor shortage. Anecdotal experience isn't very useful, but it seems to line up with what I see on the news. ""Now hiring"" signs are everywhere. Constant radio ads for decent-paying factory jobs. 

I'm on vacation, and the touristy places can't find enough employees to keep up with demand. I stopped in a service station and was chatting with the attendant (apparently manager?) a bit, and he asked if I was moving to town and could use a job. He would have made me an offer on the spot.

At least temporarily, we've gone back to the job market that boomers enjoyed when they were young. Want a job? Walk into a small business and chat them up. It's possible to get hired on the spot. With that kind of competition for workers, businesses have been forced to raise wages just to attract and retain employees."

2021-05-25 23:43:20,wallstreetbets,Time to bag hold together
2021-05-26 08:41:05,wallstreetbets,"Ive been doing research, they lowered their guidance for the 2Q and they more expenses in order to create more revenue... i dont mind that. I believe at this entry point we are in better shape than when they ipo. Also 6/14 is their exp date... im curious to see what is going to happen after the exp date"
2021-05-25 23:52:14,wallstreetbets,"At the current share price ... with $1.8 billion in cash, WISH has an enterprise value just over $3 billion... or basically what the company is going to have in revenue this year alone. 

That is absolute madness! The stock market can definitely be irrational in the short-term, but over time, it has a tendency to correct company stock prices to fair market value. 

All these dips are bringing serious attention to the stock - new buyers and a rally is incoming - only a matter of time!"
2021-05-26 12:18:33,wallstreetbets,Come on $15

2021-05-25 21:42:07,wallstreetbets,"Morons they can pay off debt, did you ever think of that before attacking captain ahab? Have you heard of airlines retards, they are near pre pandemic prices also full of debt. You are forgetting some important points...

1. They have cut all the fat
2. They will have a record year in 2022 and likely sell more in the immediate successive years then they did pre pandemic 
3. Most importantly: it’s not the amount of debt but what it costs you
3.1. They won’t pay much as they took it on in a historically low interest rate environment 
4. Comps: look at airlines who also took on loads of debt they traded up to near pre pandemic levels 

NCLH will be at $37 shortly and over $50 by years end. I love how you all act like you’re so smart repeating  what you heard on CNBC, then talking shit about Cramer. I’ve made a shit ton on NCLH in the last couple months and I’m making more tomorrow. Jolla brained followers-All aboard!!!"

I mean, the simple fucks get bailed out more than grandads rowboat. Whos to say that will not happen this time? Honestly have no idea but they play by a different set of rules"
