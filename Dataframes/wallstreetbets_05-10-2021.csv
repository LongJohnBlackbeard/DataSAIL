2021-05-10 19:59:56,wallstreetbets,You're not alone... Paytience
2021-05-10 19:58:07,wallstreetbets,Systemic risk won’t save you
2021-05-10 19:37:49,wallstreetbets,Elon will tweet something stupid and it will shoot up
2021-05-10 19:49:10,wallstreetbets,I’m hella bummed it broke that trend line today. Market was slaughtered tho. Hoping for some bounce back by EOW.
2021-05-10 19:50:22,wallstreetbets,Imma go ahead and buy calls now
2021-05-10 19:49:52,wallstreetbets,Shorting TSLA is one of the worst shorts.  A little  good news and it’ll be up 100 no problem
2021-05-10 19:37:54,wallstreetbets,"You know what they say, a tesla bear and his money are soon parted."
2021-05-10 19:40:19,wallstreetbets,I have buy orders to 350
2021-05-10 19:39:28,wallstreetbets,"400 or 500? I might just relocate everything I own into Tesla at that point. You think people are going to sell Tesla down to that, that's crazy!!"
2021-05-10 19:44:24,wallstreetbets,"Well this might be a good thing, might actually fall to the value its actually worth than being overhyped and overpriced"
2021-05-10 19:57:12,wallstreetbets,There is a bit lower volume on this drop so maybe it will get back.
2021-05-10 19:41:26,wallstreetbets,I hope for it
2021-05-10 19:39:33,wallstreetbets,I know it yes. I have just posted how it looks like form the technical point and as a start of the discussion.
2021-05-10 19:41:18,wallstreetbets,Agreed I bought the last big dip and resold around 700.
2021-05-10 19:41:11,wallstreetbets,In September last year Tesla was below that so why not?
2021-05-10 19:48:34,wallstreetbets,That would have to be very big drop as it is valued 630 times its earning when for e.g. VW has 12 and GM has 9. That means TSLA needs to increase earnings like 30 times.
2021-05-10 19:44:31,wallstreetbets,Not that you got your hopes it will never happen lol
2021-05-10 19:41:47,wallstreetbets,"Because of their growth, projected growth and future everything that they're doing"
2021-05-10 19:45:44,wallstreetbets,But when you look at the valuation it is trading at 630 of its earning. It needs to increase earnings at least 10-15 times to bring it down to some less extraordinary level.
2021-05-10 19:11:06,wallstreetbets,Down 60% and now you’re up 2k. Awesome play! Hope it runs to earnings for you
2021-05-10 19:31:19,wallstreetbets,"#so that's why it's moooning

#edit: rip calls"
2021-05-10 19:02:59,wallstreetbets,Didn't coin just post earnings before the direct listing? Was that old info ?
2021-05-10 19:19:59,wallstreetbets,"Is that a good thing? I mean, killing it on earnings?"
2021-05-10 19:14:52,wallstreetbets,They just have a slight preview
2021-05-10 19:21:09,wallstreetbets,Earnings hasn't occurred yet
2021-05-10 19:22:16,wallstreetbets,Yes I know. Seems every company that kills earnings plummets!!!
2021-05-10 19:13:49,wallstreetbets,Let me know when you figure out how to unlock green mode. I’ve been having troubles.
2021-05-10 19:41:57,wallstreetbets,"This shit blows with amd, I’ve lost around 10k around the last few weeks"
2021-05-10 18:59:03,wallstreetbets,Brutal
2021-05-10 19:07:12,wallstreetbets,Look Good. Feel Good. Play Good.
2021-05-10 19:13:24,wallstreetbets,"Hoping this $76 support holds, or grabs the $74 and rips up past $80. I’m in the 6/18 80c"
2021-05-10 19:21:28,wallstreetbets,🤣
2021-05-10 19:15:28,wallstreetbets,Good luck on those calls...sending over the good juju your way
2021-05-10 19:46:42,wallstreetbets,"I'm in $78 05/14 calls, not liking what I'm seeing. Picked them up this morning"
2021-05-10 19:41:10,wallstreetbets,We have been buying the dip. There is no more money left
2021-05-10 19:14:15,wallstreetbets,"I need to buy a put, that will stop it dipping, I never end up making much on puts."
2021-05-10 18:55:34,wallstreetbets,the entire stock is a dip
2021-05-10 19:07:31,wallstreetbets,It’s the dip that keeps on dipping
2021-05-10 18:45:21,wallstreetbets,Bet on red next time?
2021-05-10 18:50:22,wallstreetbets,How many dips can you buy?
2021-05-10 18:50:42,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip in steady declines over months? Buy puts maybe?
2021-05-10 19:45:51,wallstreetbets,Palantir keeps dipping. I guess fake it until you make it. (200 shares in and been buying covercalls this entire time at my strike).
2021-05-10 18:54:15,wallstreetbets,Big unexpected lesson to meme holders. Glad I got out at the right time.
2021-05-10 19:14:42,wallstreetbets,Correction. The entire stock market is a dip.
2021-05-10 18:53:01,wallstreetbets,It was recurring buy of 100$ a day.
2021-05-10 19:19:10,wallstreetbets,"Small cap and growth yes. People didn’t bail when this started over a month ago. I sold my pltr at a big loss, Parked it in boring boomer shit like waste mgmt. I’ll buy back in after 30 days at <$14 and take the tax loss"
2021-05-10 18:56:04,wallstreetbets,I’m sure it will dip more tomorrow with earnings so get ready
2021-05-10 19:01:55,wallstreetbets,sadly yeah. I was planning to get out when it dip below 30 before last earning but wishful thinking kicked in. I know should have got out when it dipped below 20 but again wishful thinking kicking it.
2021-05-10 18:34:11,wallstreetbets,Steel hands for paper bags.
2021-05-10 18:38:22,wallstreetbets,"u really need to rename that account from ""investing"" to ""retard"""
2021-05-10 18:36:02,wallstreetbets,A smart investor right here.
2021-05-10 18:35:57,wallstreetbets,Get back to me when you are holding 700 shares of wkhs
2021-05-10 18:47:53,wallstreetbets,I lose a lots of money on this stock also
2021-05-10 18:41:49,wallstreetbets,NNDM is going to really fly in the next year.
2021-05-10 19:20:50,wallstreetbets,"You still got 4g that’s the problem, upgrade that shit to 5g for the gains"
2021-05-10 18:36:23,wallstreetbets,Amc
2021-05-10 18:36:45,wallstreetbets,Can I ask what you invested in?
2021-05-10 18:38:33,wallstreetbets,Ain't no paper in your hands either my boy
2021-05-10 18:56:00,wallstreetbets,Ouch
2021-05-10 19:03:10,wallstreetbets,I could relate down to my last thousand going in on amc calls I'm green right now so let's see if that keeps up 😂
2021-05-10 19:27:45,wallstreetbets,This is why they don’t call us the “smart money”.
2021-05-10 19:29:41,wallstreetbets,BRAVO
2021-05-10 19:03:20,wallstreetbets,Steel hands lead to steel reserve in a paper bag
2021-05-10 18:36:56,wallstreetbets,sir you are holding quite a bag and for that I commend you
2021-05-10 18:42:58,wallstreetbets,no cap
2021-05-10 18:37:57,wallstreetbets,positions are there
2021-05-10 19:54:07,wallstreetbets,What is a smart?
2021-05-10 19:21:47,wallstreetbets,"Not proud of it, but now I must hold those bags until they get lighter or my arms fall off"
2021-05-10 19:37:52,wallstreetbets,I’m confused why there’s not enough market for both companies? UWMC had 41x growth from Q1 2020 and owns 4.5% of originated home loans. That’s not exactly a massive amount. I think RKT would rather cut into PennyMac or WellsFargos share of the market since RKT is gonna should make more off a b2c model Vs b2b model right?
2021-05-10 19:37:54,wallstreetbets,Why does google finance show rkt q1 2021 net income of 123 million while rockets earnings release shows 2.7 billion net income? Just bad data on google or what am I missing here? Seems these financial services can't get rockets numbers accurate for some reason?
2021-05-10 18:39:50,wallstreetbets,They went down because they had lower guidance for the rest of the year
2021-05-10 19:05:02,wallstreetbets,"And yet no huge dive for uwmc similar to rkt. Old school players fighting hard. My 2 cents. 

I’m not fucking selling!"
2021-05-10 19:52:47,wallstreetbets,Still not sure how you were able to ascertain this from the earnings. Don't you think Gilbert would crow that to the world if they had definitive proof the addendum backfired and drove more business to Rkt?
2021-05-10 18:39:07,wallstreetbets,"On the wholesale side it doesn’t naturally fall to better rates. It falls to competitive rates but more so on speed, underwriting and a short stip sheet.

They both have the market share because of speed. But the war between the two being so similar will open the wholesale market up for others, if they can get their shit together.

I don’t foresee an either or scenario. What I do see, when the market cools, is who has the stronger balance sheet to weather the storm.

I wouldn’t be surprised if they both collapse when the going gets tough, only to be acquired by the silent #3."
2021-05-10 18:47:47,wallstreetbets,Yea but there is a class action lawsuit against them that began in Florida. Agents are refusing to sign on to that agreement
2021-05-10 18:57:04,wallstreetbets,POGGERS
2021-05-10 18:43:47,wallstreetbets,The estimates for the rest of year and next year were low already and I think that was known to everyone
2021-05-10 18:50:28,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-10 19:06:26,wallstreetbets,Uwmc already sold off on rkt's earnings
2021-05-10 19:57:40,wallstreetbets,"the percent drops for uwmc at this point gonna be a lot slower considering where it is from ipo.

no momo."
2021-05-10 19:56:04,wallstreetbets,Look at UWMC earnings today. Missed eps and revenue by a decent percentage.
2021-05-10 18:43:08,wallstreetbets,Market is too fragmented and #3 ( Fairway Independent Mortgage Corp ) is too far behind to matter in the foreseeable future.
2021-05-10 19:08:58,wallstreetbets,Uwmc survived 08 so I’m sure they will be fine
2021-05-10 19:20:33,wallstreetbets,Silent #3??? Rkt has 8billion of liquidity....
2021-05-10 19:06:40,wallstreetbets,This ckass action shot typically accompanies a short attack. I’ve seen it before. Let me know if it ever makes it to court.
2021-05-10 18:58:32,wallstreetbets,I mean they have been the number 1 wholesale lender for 6 years in a row so they aren’t just going to go randomly bankrupt they survived and grew in 08 and the numbers from the ultimatum will show up on q2 earnings so we will have to see if it worked or not
2021-05-10 19:11:37,wallstreetbets,"You’re probably right lol. I wonder what the short interest in rkt is right now? Seriously, this makes no sense at all.."
2021-05-10 19:57:43,wallstreetbets,"Let's wait until the call tomorrow for confirmation of that. Also, it doesn't mean Rkt took that business from them"
2021-05-10 19:24:05,wallstreetbets,"So did Washington Mutual and Countrywide, granted subprime is dead."
2021-05-10 19:05:46,wallstreetbets,Ultimatum was 1/3 of q1 so its already showing up
2021-05-10 19:43:33,wallstreetbets,UWMC gives out sweet dividends my man!!
2021-05-10 19:26:32,wallstreetbets,"Yea thats a terrible comparison, thats not even a comparison."
2021-05-10 19:06:20,wallstreetbets,Yeah so we will see
2021-05-10 19:28:36,wallstreetbets,What’s the difference besides subprime lending?
2021-05-10 19:29:59,wallstreetbets,"Besides a complete overhaul of lending regulations, uwing requirements, and no longer allowing people to buy homes they cant afford?"
2021-05-10 19:38:49,wallstreetbets,So foreclosures should never happen right?
2021-05-10 19:50:58,wallstreetbets,"At WaMu we gave you a mortgage if you had a pulse and a credit score above 700 no matter what job and salary you put down.... yeah, it's totally fucking different. Don't even try to compare those. The shit WaMu did to own the market was borderline criminal lol"
2021-05-10 19:03:22,wallstreetbets,beauty is in the eye of the bag holder
2021-05-10 19:42:26,wallstreetbets,"JB: WHAT ARE THESE CHAIRS MADE OF!?

2021-05-10 18:50:37,wallstreetbets,What movie is it?
2021-05-10 19:14:32,wallstreetbets,Imagine this movie coming out in today’s climate
2021-05-10 19:01:18,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure all the woke police would have a problem with it.
2021-05-10 19:47:37,wallstreetbets,"I saw it when I was pretty young and don't remember much, might have to give it a rewatch"

2021-05-10 18:43:42,wallstreetbets,They've done nothing but exceed expectations and are victims of the tech sell off and one hell of a whale. The squeeze is coming!!!!!!
2021-05-10 18:31:18,wallstreetbets,Rope
2021-05-10 18:44:06,wallstreetbets,I’m rooting for you!

2021-05-10 18:30:54,wallstreetbets,Looks like my portfolio but with one ticker
2021-05-10 18:31:54,wallstreetbets,Fuck me!
2021-05-10 18:51:07,wallstreetbets,So I'm guessing you're expecting their earnings to be somehow amazing? If you got those expos that is
2021-05-10 19:09:16,wallstreetbets,Pipe dream.  Step away from the ledge!
2021-05-10 19:10:24,wallstreetbets,Are you on the NNOX pages and discord?

2021-05-10 18:41:01,wallstreetbets,"Nope,  just belive in my fundamentals. If you DD you WILL be a believer too."
2021-05-10 18:36:42,wallstreetbets,Come hey me man. Solid company ready for a run
2021-05-10 18:53:15,wallstreetbets,No. Not news of the multi source and licensing deals. Value is already there.
2021-05-10 19:13:34,wallstreetbets,You've got a short position
2021-05-10 19:21:54,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-10 18:46:09,wallstreetbets,What was your total position at buying? This can’t be zero..
2021-05-10 19:16:10,wallstreetbets,Want nothing to do with this.
2021-05-10 19:25:30,wallstreetbets,"Cool, best of luck to you and all of us! 
I'm about to have some more shares. I sold a $30 put when it was around $40. It looks like it will probably be assigned haha. Guess I'm going in deeper. To the pits or the moon!"
2021-05-10 18:47:47,wallstreetbets,I was a small buyer at first but the sell off was insane to me and I dumped everything in. This is BIG!!!
2021-05-10 19:22:22,wallstreetbets,You don't want tendies?
2021-05-10 18:58:50,wallstreetbets,"I’m still long UWM; their dividend is decent, their company has survived through thick and thin (‘86-current), and their business (mortgages/housing in general not just UWMC) is being basically openly supported by the gvmt right now. I plan on holding this company for +10 years"
2021-05-10 19:57:59,wallstreetbets,UWMC = U Want Margin Call?
2021-05-10 18:33:30,wallstreetbets,"Ugh...Idk which bag i hate more, PLTR or UWMC?... oh, and now DKNG but DKNG has more promise in the short term at least. I have a feeling I'll be bag holding PLTR and UWMC for a long time before I turn a profit again."
2021-05-10 19:48:30,wallstreetbets,I’m long & strong with no margin position so I have time to ride it out 🙏🏻🚀
2021-05-10 18:29:53,wallstreetbets,Buy back could cause short squeeze and buyback shouldn’t change the percentage because the shares are being retired.
2021-05-10 19:17:17,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the bull/bear tags.
2021-05-10 19:09:11,wallstreetbets,"Price action has been a war after hours. 

Green -> red -> green. Big swings. 

If huge buyback commences tomorrow, this could be the squeeze."
2021-05-10 19:03:02,wallstreetbets,Bag holders is right. Watching it spike up and thinking...Here we go. I guess not
2021-05-10 19:34:16,wallstreetbets,What do you tell a person with two black eyes? I already told you twice. Seems like this isn't meme stock season.
2021-05-10 19:45:41,wallstreetbets,"Yo, they can take their divies and rub it on their chest. As soon as this shit hits my break even, I'm outtie 5000"
2021-05-10 19:59:12,wallstreetbets,So much did for a stock that keeps hitting new lows every day
2021-05-10 18:44:32,wallstreetbets,"IPO = $10
Buybacks starting tomorrow < $7
Scalped arbitrage profit for the Ishbia Clan after marketing UWM at the SPAC price = $3"
2021-05-10 19:02:39,wallstreetbets,"6% dividend at this price is more than decent, also add in the potential upside and it’s a buy now."
2021-05-10 18:44:42,wallstreetbets,"At least UWMC has a good dividend but yeah, nothing makes sense in this market any longer"
2021-05-10 18:40:05,wallstreetbets,I was thinking this also. Big f u and start buying tomorrow to show they ain’t bluffing.  But that’s just hope and hope leads to the dark side.
2021-05-10 19:34:54,wallstreetbets,"Float decreases by 40% but total share pretty much stays the same so it won't work.

However, UWMC can buy 20M shares and still be eligible for Russel Index (float must >5% of total shares). That is still 20% of float. Then once lock up period is over, UWMC can convert class D to class A and continue buy back shares.

It's hypothetical, not saying it's happening tomorrow but that'd be something."
2021-05-10 18:43:15,wallstreetbets,You don’t think shorts are shitting themselves right now knowing UWMC can execute a buy back of half the public float at any point?
2021-05-10 19:43:30,wallstreetbets,">They announced a 300M buy back. Effective May 11th, 2021 to May 11, 2023. UWMC has complete option to buy back 300M shares between this time frame and all shares purchased will be retired. **This is typically done to drive the stalk price up**

Calls on ZCN21!

I believe the % would change depending on how it was used... if it was converting class D to Class A and then retired or retiring from current class A float. Here is my retarded math if they execute a buyback @ $7/share (42,857,142 shares would be bought back):

**Current float**: 1,502,069,787 (Class D left); 103,104,205 (Class A left) = \~6.4% float

**Buyback Class D Conversion ($7 / share)**: 1,459,212,644 (Class D left); 103,104,205 (Class A left) = \~6.6% float

**Buyback Current Float ($7 / share)**: 1,502,069,787 (Class D left); 60,247,062 (Class A left) = \~3.8% float

I would check my math though. No ape to cheat off"
2021-05-10 19:30:37,wallstreetbets,Been like that all day. Any time it passed 6.80 it’d immediately dive down. Definitely curious movements throughout the day.
2021-05-10 18:50:30,wallstreetbets,"You have been posting this in every thread about this stock.  

How exactly do you think they've been mismanaging the company?  They can't make people buy the stock.  The best they can do is run a really successful business and by all accounts it looks like they are."
2021-05-10 19:04:32,wallstreetbets,"If I make money, I don’t fucken care."
2021-05-10 18:49:07,wallstreetbets,The big money boomers are moving their money into boomer stocks. Gotta be. They're the only stocks going and staying green.
2021-05-10 18:43:47,wallstreetbets,"I'm expecting them to start buying tomorrow like crazy, Why wouldn't they at this price point. Plus, they have the cash"
2021-05-10 19:57:17,wallstreetbets,"Why would they give it a 2 year period to buy the shares then? Why wouldn't they say, we will buy back all shares within 1 month?"
2021-05-10 18:09:20,wallstreetbets,Gay Bears feasting on Tesla to $300
2021-05-10 18:16:37,wallstreetbets,"That's a long shot. It's one thing to buy some puts here and there utilizing volatility and make some money. But shorting TSLA with an intention to tank the SP is a whole different story that never ended in a good way so far. Anyway, I go with the flow to make some money without being an exclusive bear or bull."
2021-05-10 18:39:26,wallstreetbets,TSLA is 1.5% of the S&P assests. Even if it goes to 0 it wont have much of an impact on S&P.
2021-05-10 18:51:13,wallstreetbets,"But it's correlated.

How many people are leveraging up with Tesla as one of their bets?

When the de-leveraging occurs, watch out."
2021-05-10 18:42:32,wallstreetbets,SPY will probably go back to test 410-411 mark and even further down to 400. It doesnt have much catalyst to go beyond 420-425 but quite a few to go down.
2021-05-10 18:22:40,wallstreetbets,"lmfao as if iranian posturing has affected the markets since they chased out the shah

what a joke"
2021-05-10 18:43:54,wallstreetbets,If 417 - 415 doesn't hold I think you may be right friend!
2021-05-10 18:23:33,wallstreetbets,Just a thesis friend.

2021-05-10 18:13:44,wallstreetbets,Nice write up
2021-05-10 18:30:54,wallstreetbets,Silver stays flat and you just get whipped around by the big lads who own 99% of it. Not for me probably
2021-05-10 19:21:09,wallstreetbets,"And just like that


100 million ozs gone 


🙊🙈🙉"
2021-05-10 19:03:37,wallstreetbets,116 million ounces disappears. Price should pop.
2021-05-10 18:21:22,wallstreetbets,Looks like one of those opportunities!
2021-05-10 19:02:15,wallstreetbets,"I focus on the data and eliminate emotion from my reviews ; emotion is the curse of many who trade and invest in this sector. Sentiment is one of the most powerful tools in precious metals, because so many are so passionate about Gold and Silver that they let their emotions get the better of them at or near peaks and troughs, I am not a day trader and looks like really is looking up from data’s of CPI and coming shortage of physical metal. those data’s and news just provide one last opportunity to get long for new highs this year."""
2021-05-10 18:16:25,wallstreetbets,Thanks for sharing buddy :-)

Silver has excellent upside potential with minimal downside risk."
2021-05-10 19:53:45,wallstreetbets,We should organize a huge silver buying day
2021-05-10 19:34:03,wallstreetbets,Probably won't even get reported on by CNBC.
2021-05-10 19:50:48,wallstreetbets,Good information thanks
2021-05-10 19:32:09,wallstreetbets,Good work bro!!!
2021-05-10 19:06:11,wallstreetbets,"Dude end of March silver touched 23,80 and today 27,40 is not enough ? And more coming just started"
2021-05-10 18:20:19,wallstreetbets,You are welcome 🙏 so hope is useful dude
2021-05-10 18:33:58,wallstreetbets,"Here I am looking 2011 CPI which was 3.5 and silver reached 50 usd . Nowadays CPI is 2,6 and my expectation will reach 3.5/4 within next couple of months and silver due to CPI will rise as was in 2011 . Because I don’t normally credit too much doomsday or manipulation ( last 10 years CPI never touched 3 % and silver also never touched more than 30 ) I keep it simple as like this. Plus above news abt physical shortage and lbma data  change increase fuel to my prediction ."
2021-05-10 19:22:57,wallstreetbets,"This is almost 2,7 billion usd  due to data submission error ??????????????????????? I don’t know enough question marks. I think this news is a incredible bullish cause now shortages almost sure and with pslv huge every day buying is increasing more and more .  Please also add that last 11 months , silver biggest consumer India bought almost zero and all those will come next months as delayed orders and put more pressure to physical shortages .."
2021-05-10 19:04:49,wallstreetbets,Already started to pop up look last 2 weeks amazing and looks like coming more
2021-05-10 18:22:36,wallstreetbets,No dude I have learned most from here my fellows so now aim just to inform rest is up to you regards best wishes
2021-05-10 18:19:31,wallstreetbets,You are welcome 🙏 in fact there are many more interesting things happening now but just 2 news most important among them  nowadays . I tried to keep it short because everything is so obvious and wanted to share with my fellows
2021-05-10 19:55:47,wallstreetbets,Add some physical also dude to support physical shortage( look pslv Canadian one )
2021-05-10 18:54:20,wallstreetbets,I am thinking similar low risk especially such a inflationary times ( even transitory or not ) looks like will give good profits
2021-05-10 19:59:24,wallstreetbets,I don’t know even time allow this because what I am seeing big wave of price up
2021-05-10 19:36:35,wallstreetbets,Just I saw there one Singapore bullion bank now establish 400 million ozz of silver vaults which is also adding more fuel to silver physical shortage
2021-05-10 19:51:27,wallstreetbets,You are welcome
2021-05-10 19:35:16,wallstreetbets,Thanks and hope you are in the right side of trade in this highly inflationary times .
2021-05-10 19:43:49,wallstreetbets,"I put my calculation according to expected CPI value  see also below interesting silver price targets I don’t here say I expect the following but just some information ; 

According to the US debt clock, Silver should be at $4,797, but this is implausible. If we take the highs of 1980 and adjust for CPI inflation, that puts silver somewhere just above $140 now. If we take the historical gold to debt ratio up to today’s levels and place it against the mean of the gold/silver ratio, it puts it above $180. If we look at the mining ratio out of the ground and apply it against gold price today it would put silver at around $228. If we take the lowest gold/silver ratio over the last 50 years, it puts silver at $122 at the current gold price."
2021-05-10 19:31:49,wallstreetbets,Most anti silver investors don’t want to touch due to high manipulation in silver market and nowadays what they are missing in their analyses those manipulation are above the end by physical buying of individuals . So altogether now it is time to forget old silver bad experiences due to organized communities organized movements. And therefore I don’t credit too much manipulation anymore due to individuals more eager organized buying in the market . Nowadays many more people started to run away unallocated silver derivatives and therefore now I am Uber bullish  and see the light end of the tunnel .otherwise in the old conditions I will never touch  therefore I stated above 2 news that  we are really end of old times experiences and really this time is different.
2021-05-10 18:37:00,wallstreetbets,"With silver you have to take into account manipulation, i agree people flee to metals with higher CPI, but that was 2011. Now there are many different stores of value. People are flocking to crypto instead of metals for large amounts of $$$ these days, and most people don’t want to own physical silver."
2021-05-10 18:15:33,wallstreetbets,Dont forget they announced via 8K last week preliminary Q1 results that were a 38% increase. Jp morgan today increased target to $40.00 and i would expect ASO to increase there year end guidence shortly.
2021-05-10 17:28:48,wallstreetbets,110 @ 35.25 | hoping for a huge upswing.
2021-05-10 17:30:54,wallstreetbets,119 @ 28
2021-05-10 18:12:37,wallstreetbets,Sold my calls today for a 500$ profit. I'm not mad b/c I think that money will make me alot more that ASO would have. Best wishes to you all. It should moon now that I'm out🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-10 19:07:41,wallstreetbets,Not sure I understand the logic of why the stock had a ceiling on it due to KKR. These guys made a ton of money on the IPO and the subsequent run up... why would they not want to make more?
2021-05-10 19:30:15,wallstreetbets,Im hoping for an EOY target between $55-60. I dont see a squeeze happening.
2021-05-10 19:00:07,wallstreetbets,and there’s now $50 strikes available. just need to fill some of those months of no options... at least weekly would be nice. needs a little more volume
2021-05-10 18:16:44,wallstreetbets,Can you share this?
2021-05-10 17:33:22,wallstreetbets,"This thing is already undervalued as this as a value play for me, with the potential short squeeze as an added bonus.  It might dip some more but I believe you are completely fine holding at those levels long term. Good luck!"
2021-05-10 17:32:38,wallstreetbets,still has a perfect 10/10 buy rating
2021-05-10 17:39:04,wallstreetbets,This is where I started my position. Should of added more sooner
2021-05-10 18:16:01,wallstreetbets,That's why I'm only holding shares. Much easier to ride the waves on the way up
2021-05-10 19:06:42,wallstreetbets,up 1k off shares
2021-05-10 19:23:46,wallstreetbets,"People just thought it was going to dip when KKR was going to sell off their 14m share position. That fact that their position is officially closed and the stock went up since then is a good sign for the stock. Means there's strong support at the levels we are at now.

Don't have an official answer for why they sold but if I had to take a guess I would think that it became too large of a position for them. Even with it running well it's probably them reallocating their portfolio so they aren't so heavily weighted on ASO. Help +180% since IPO and they probably got a price lower than that. Even with good stocks you secure those gains imo"
2021-05-10 19:36:17,wallstreetbets,I don't see it happening either. I was in this as a value play first with the potential short squeeze as an added bonus. I feel the short float will most likely be lowered when it is released tomorrow. Things will get interesting if it has increased though

2021-05-10 19:34:25,wallstreetbets,Could ASO have made an agreement prior to IPO for a buyback timeline?
2021-05-10 19:37:42,wallstreetbets,Price continued to increase with 45% short float. Legit APES would be shorting still.
2021-05-10 19:04:39,wallstreetbets,mostly smart money in aso..

2021-05-10 19:43:46,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. There was 14m in daily volume on May 6th, which was 7x the daily volume at the time. I feel like some of the shorts had to of taken advantage of that to cut their loses."

So buy more growth?"

2021-05-10 17:22:57,wallstreetbets,If there’s lots of inflation that just makes all the stocks worth more $

Why are you not doing this on a real broker on XSP instead of SPY?"

2021-05-10 18:39:45,wallstreetbets,"Yea, I know. I’ve been just doing that for the past few weeks and it has somewhat worked until today. I’m guessing I can’t sell because of the call spread I also sold (and it was impossible to close due to no buyers)"

2021-05-10 19:00:40,wallstreetbets,There’s an FAQ on transferring stock to a different broker. Setup your fidelity account before you start the process. Robinhood support is not going to be helpful with this process AT ALL
2021-05-10 18:56:44,wallstreetbets,"Sell everything, withdrawal, deposit, rebuy. Or just literally transfer stocks. But it takes like a week

2021-05-10 18:56:32,wallstreetbets,"Your rh account by default is a margin account unless you turned that off so that you can instantly access money from your trades. Options settle in 1  day stocks in 3, but margin on your account allows you to instantly use the proceeds. You start with a certain margin you can trade which I believe 4x the maintenance margin of the previous close. Were you daytrading other positions today in which you could have depleted this margin. Source: I have gotten the insufficient funds warning before and had to deposit money to close a trade, good times. Also if your money in your account is all in positions that don't add to your margin maintenance this daytrade limit is absurdly low ie. you all in options last night."
2021-05-10 18:12:00,wallstreetbets,"Such hostility. Find me a broker with a usable UI, who will let me trade how I want (software issues aside), and doesn't charge an arm and a leg for commissions and I'll consider switching. Otherwise, your opinion carries very little weight."
2021-05-10 17:05:07,wallstreetbets,"When I try to write new calls I keep getting an error about not having enough cash for margin maintenence, but that's ridiculous since I've had three times as much in cash as I had been using in margin for days now and still can't. It sucks because I wanted to roll some CCs and it wouldn't let me, same as writing new ones. 

I'm thinking they might have a bug at the moment where they're not considering equity in the margin calculation when it comes to short options."
2021-05-10 17:59:25,wallstreetbets,Good bot.
2021-05-10 17:41:30,wallstreetbets,"That’s what they say they do, if you don’t have funds available to execute the option."
2021-05-10 19:04:20,wallstreetbets,I agree liquidate Robin Hood get your money first. They took more than two weeks to transfer my stocks and the minute you say you’re going to transfer they freeze your account and you can’t do anything. they are horrible get your money out as soon as possible
2021-05-10 18:58:22,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’m thinking I’d rather wait the week for the transfer vs a week for robinhood to actually make my money available for withdrawal / send funds to bank. I’ve looked on how to transfer and can’t find info, but I was looking on the apps not browser."
2021-05-10 19:54:42,wallstreetbets,It’s the shittier option that’s why
2021-05-10 19:21:32,wallstreetbets,Ouch. I got 20 cheap $18 that would be ITM today.
2021-05-10 18:40:39,wallstreetbets,"> who will let me trade how I want 

Peeps, we can't convince someone whose strategy is to not be able to trade at all on the important days 😂

Some people like to be cuffed when they get fucked"
2021-05-10 18:15:38,wallstreetbets,I guess that's important stuff but I prefer a broker who let's me buy and sell when I want to buy and sell. If you think you're ok because they haven't done that to a particular stock you want to buy or sell yet... Well the key word is yet.
2021-05-10 18:40:32,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-10 18:22:58,wallstreetbets,"this,

what happened to your  is normal that's why you sell before expiration"
2021-05-10 19:07:49,wallstreetbets,Liquidating might not be the right move though if you’re taking taxes into consideration. If you don’t care about short term vs long term capital gains then yeah sell it all and avoid the headache of the transfer....also RH doesn’t transfer the stocks with cost basis information so if you own a lot of different stocks that’s a bit of a pain in the ass too
2021-05-10 19:52:43,wallstreetbets,"Took me 2 days to move to TD. Did it last week.  Use the other brockets site. Go to “transfer account” and just enter your RH account number etc

RH locks your account. And in a few days it’s in your new account"
2021-05-10 18:46:13,wallstreetbets,And so we're back to people not understanding what happened. Do you care to learn or would you prefer to continue reveling in your ignorance?
2021-05-10 18:17:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I kinda figured you were stuck on that. Do tell me, why do you think they restricted trading of GME a few months ago? This should be fun."
2021-05-10 18:47:52,wallstreetbets,"Meh, ToS is OK. Like most of the brokers it's too cluttered and clunky if you want to set up complicated strategies. Actually, IIRC you can only choose from a defined list of strategies.  That's a non-starter for me."
2021-05-10 18:42:20,wallstreetbets,Yup.  Its on him.  The option rules clearly define this on all brokerages.  The time may vary but the process is the same.
2021-05-10 18:33:11,wallstreetbets,"As if the why matters. They have one job- to execute buys and sells on anything their customers tell them to. Or I should say that's the job of a real brokerage, which they obviously are not."
2021-05-10 19:06:01,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-10 18:33:50,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I didn't figure you knew."
2021-05-10 19:09:10,wallstreetbets,Can you define the strategy you want to use? If I want to open a jade lizard... can I?
2021-05-10 18:35:09,wallstreetbets,Please tell me a reason that makes you comfortable with them controlling the sale of your assets? This should be good.
2021-05-10 19:13:44,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-10 18:39:36,wallstreetbets,Because they're governed by the same rules as any other broker. If they violate those rules they'll be held accountable like any other broker. They didn't even do anything that most brokers didn't also do.
2021-05-10 19:15:08,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, I think I remember that now. Was still clunky."
2021-05-10 18:47:21,wallstreetbets,"Lol... So basically, they didn't have the capital to cover like Fidelity and vanguard did, so that's why they're ok! Hilarious man."
2021-05-10 18:48:34,wallstreetbets,"Oh, you finally went to Google. Good job!"
2021-05-10 18:53:00,wallstreetbets,"Uh huh... Holding GameStop and AMC since November but I didn't know what Robinhoods excuse was. Get real dude.

Then they came for my meme coin..

But ya they'll surely never ever come for anyone's Amazon or Apple. For sure!"
2021-05-10 18:54:43,wallstreetbets,"So, you know that the decision was outside their control and yet you still attribute it to malice. You probably wonder why people say y'all are delusional too, eh?"
2021-05-10 18:56:38,wallstreetbets,"I said it was malice? Pretty sure I just said they lacked capital which real brokers did not. That's just laughable, kind of like their ""headquarters"" and their ""call center""."

Try GS, it’s not as volatile, theta is much lower , you can make some good money and then loose it all again with more tsla options"
2021-05-10 17:06:27,wallstreetbets,Maybe don’t buy into overvalued stonks like $TSLA

2021-05-10 17:16:05,wallstreetbets,It looks like you bought this to hold for a long time so why not share the calls and just have shares?

2021-05-10 16:40:29,wallstreetbets,I've bought. every dip and it's at 6.51. Whatever.  Paycheck going right into more shares. 701 shares now at almost 8 avg
2021-05-10 16:45:28,wallstreetbets,Gonna need UWMC to mortgage me a nice luxury cardboard box.

I bought a little stock that did sublime loans

They came out with their earnings the list was trash

Now I’m behind a Wendy’s sucking dick for cash."

2021-05-10 16:27:43,wallstreetbets,She’s about to start a nice bull run finally
2021-05-10 16:36:02,wallstreetbets,"Wow.  

From last quarter UWMC decreased revenue by 10% and adjusted net income by 38%.  Housing market is dropping.  

This is not what crushing earnings looks like."
2021-05-10 17:19:23,wallstreetbets,they said gain margin will be down from 219 bps in Q1 to 75 to 110 bps next quarter which means revenue will be down over 50%...not a surprise the stock is down...
2021-05-10 16:40:49,wallstreetbets,Decentralization is the only way
2021-05-10 17:11:43,wallstreetbets,Wondering if its a good time to buy now since its at its lowest?
2021-05-10 17:56:02,wallstreetbets,Holy sht. This is a terrible print. Rev declined 33% from 4Q20.
2021-05-10 16:36:16,wallstreetbets,"Best Q1 ever, stock CLAPPED 😑"
2021-05-10 16:56:44,wallstreetbets,Holy shit that’s actually really nice. Also explains the odd push back to any upward trajectory. They’re buying their own shares back and probably to keep that price down before doing so.
2021-05-10 17:39:05,wallstreetbets,And it went sideways. Bought Jan 2023 $2.50 calls and sold June $7 calls before earnings. Easy tendies.

2021-05-10 18:50:51,wallstreetbets,"Anyone looking at this thread keep in mind one thing (and this is not investment advise): RKT dropped in price because they gave an outlook for a rough Q2. UWMC did exactly the opposite. 

They confirmed the dividend, announced share buybacks, and gave a positive forecast. The future is all that matters."
2021-05-10 17:52:25,wallstreetbets,"lmao, 1 week after $RKT"
2021-05-10 17:39:02,wallstreetbets,impossible!
2021-05-10 17:15:20,wallstreetbets,Stock buy backs and announced dividend? I’m loading up on shares. They’re too cheap and there’s a lot of value here now. Their guidance was great as they expect to increase their volume 2q while they said their competition expects their volume to shrink in a rising rate market.
2021-05-10 17:17:41,wallstreetbets,"How can it get crushed when it traded at it's lowest price since it went public today? However, It did make another all time low (ATL) record in AH. At least there is that."

2021-05-10 16:25:34,wallstreetbets,So stock price goes down?

2021-05-10 16:57:59,wallstreetbets,There's no way it gets on the Russell with a buyback. The publicly available voting power won't be above the 5% threshold.
2021-05-10 16:54:59,wallstreetbets,They missed earnings. Reread the ER. We r fucked
2021-05-10 17:57:00,wallstreetbets,I own UWMC. This was fucking terrible.
2021-05-10 16:38:49,wallstreetbets,Lfg!
2021-05-10 16:40:01,wallstreetbets,"They missed EPS and revenue, lol. The fuck are y’all talking about?

Comparatively this was a significantly bigger miss than RKT’s ER"
2021-05-10 16:31:44,wallstreetbets,Yup. We uphill from here.
2021-05-10 16:48:09,wallstreetbets,"Mortgage business is cyclical, Q1 is the slowest because it's predominantly winter months.  Seeing a dip for Q1 doesn't mean the market is chilling, it means it was cold outside."
2021-05-10 16:39:43,wallstreetbets,Q4 was driving by massive refis. Same for RKT. Refi savings have dried up for most mortgagees. Hence the drop.
2021-05-10 16:43:34,wallstreetbets,"Yet look at this thread. It’s literally full of comments saying the exact opposite. They missed on both EPS and revenue.

Are these comments from people who just don’t realize that because there just reading the first few paragraphs of this press release, or do people think they can just comment a green day into existence?"
2021-05-10 17:20:21,wallstreetbets,Lowest?  Doubt it.  RKT & LDI have not stopped shedding since earnings...UWMC will continue down as well.
2021-05-10 18:57:16,wallstreetbets,It’s a cyclical business genius. That’s like saying Amazon is fucked because their revenue declined the quarter after Christmas. You have to compare it to the quarter of the previous year.
2021-05-10 18:06:51,wallstreetbets,Man 2006 was the shit. Hey that minus sign looks like an error so we should white that out and scan the document again.  45 seconds later. Approved for a jumbo.
2021-05-10 18:27:02,wallstreetbets,I think at this point they are low enough to pass under anything.

This stock will never be a high flyer, people need to understand that, but I could see it being a really nice long term hold with that dividend and the fact that the company is absurdly healthy."
2021-05-10 17:55:59,wallstreetbets,You are correct sir
2021-05-10 17:23:17,wallstreetbets,"Things can always go lower, but I did say that it won't get crushed :)"
2021-05-10 16:32:23,wallstreetbets,"Because as some apes have shrieked into my ear canal, causing a ripple and fold into an otherwise delicate and smooth brain, that the market is not just about the current state but the future state, and there’s definitely fear again that the housing market is in a bit of a pandemic bubble. My favorite color is green but it seems that I always end up holding the red crayon. I also spread paste on toast cause it looks the same as butter, so do not trust a damn word I say."
2021-05-10 16:40:18,wallstreetbets,"The good news is that UWM knows they are undervalued. Hence the buy back, if they mooned there wouldn't be this buyback. But why not, they got their going public funding, might as well buy back some of that at a bargain. Less dividends to payout."
2021-05-10 16:31:18,wallstreetbets,"Just how the market works. Take logic, throw out window, and now you have how market acts..

For reference, they crushed it so market just gave them a new 52 week low!"
2021-05-10 16:37:52,wallstreetbets,"Because this guy is full of shit.

2021-05-10 16:52:26,wallstreetbets,We gonna have to average down to break even. This stock is gonna boom when the housing situation gets back into motion. We need to evict bums that can’t pay rent and foreclose houses that can’t pay. Then the market resets and we can see the stock take off. Worst case this is like holding CCL or Airlines last year.
2021-05-10 16:45:23,wallstreetbets,"They didn't miss EPS.  It's $0.47, analysts had expected EPS around $0.41."
2021-05-10 16:42:16,wallstreetbets,Rkt didn’t tank bc they missed eps is because their guidance was down
2021-05-10 18:19:07,wallstreetbets,"I think he is right. I would suggest educating yourself on how earnings reports impact a stocks price. nasdaq.com has some guides for you. Here is a preview of one for you:

“Guidance: Although not required to do so, most companies will, along with their report of what happened in the previous quarter, issue an estimate of what they expect in the next quarter and even over the next year. This is known as “guidance” and will often have more effect on the stock than what has actually happened. If you see a company report better than expected revenue and profit, but the stock drops immediately after the release, then it is usually because the report also contains guidance that is lower than was expected. In that case what happened last quarter is pretty irrelevant; it is the prospects for the future that count.”


RKT issued guidance that suggested the next quarter will be rocky. UWMC issued positive guidance for Q2. This is more important than Q1 results. RKT tanked because of the guidance they gave.

Realistically I think you know this and you’re probably shorting the stock or you are invested in a competitor. Because there is no other reason for you to be wasting your time in this post."
2021-05-10 16:41:56,wallstreetbets,☝️
2021-05-10 16:58:12,wallstreetbets,Did they though? Fairly certain the were slightly above. Not to mention the growth. RKT bag holder?
2021-05-10 17:54:38,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-10 16:49:33,wallstreetbets,100% agree if we were talking at any other time where we didn’t have a global pandemic and recovery.  Q1 2021 is a lot closer to Q4 2020 than it is to Q1 2020.
2021-05-10 16:41:18,wallstreetbets,Yep.  You know your shit.  😎👍
2021-05-10 16:45:35,wallstreetbets,"One thing I respect about UWMC is that they included their Q4 numbers right in the report.  

I did an analysis on the RKT earnings and I had to use their prior quarterly report just to compare the Q4 vs Q1 numbers.  I have a lot more respect for UWMC for not trying to hide their decrease in sales."
2021-05-10 17:32:47,wallstreetbets,Did they do share buy backs the day after earnings?
2021-05-10 19:05:32,wallstreetbets,"Uh,  no. They totally whiffed vs analyst estimates. GS had a rev estimate of $1.5B and UWMC reported less than $1.2B. 
Consensus orig volumes were $57, they reported sub $50.

This was a terrible report. The stock is sub $7 so hopefully doesn’t have much further to fall but you’re smoking way too much copium if you see it any other way."

2021-05-10 18:36:06,wallstreetbets,So buy shares and sell covered calls while collecting dividends....?

2021-05-10 18:15:27,wallstreetbets,"Wrong. They IPO’d at $10 will begin buyback under $7M, thus they’ve scalped $3+/share from their shareholders. They marketed themselves at the valuation of the SPAC. I would not be surprised if they too were brought under investigation."

Uwm had that kinda miss in q1 and they're acting like they got q2 locked down lol"
2021-05-10 18:59:59,wallstreetbets,"Oh look, another person that learned about the stock market a couple of months ago, bought high and now believes all his bags are the result of some grand short conspiracy. Good forbid someone not like your meme stock.

Every mortgage provider has tanked because literally everyone with half a brain knows the housing market is going to cool off and that it will affect *every one*

Why the hell do you think UWMC is way down the last couple weeks/months?

UWMC’s guidance amounted to them saying they don’t think the market is going to cool off as soon as most people do. RKT thinks it is going to cool off soon. Cool. Maybe UWMC will be right. Maybe they won’t."
2021-05-10 17:37:38,wallstreetbets,"Hah....fun fact, they ain’t buying $300 mil worth of shares tomorrow.  Evenly splitting that up for 24 months means ~60,000 shares tomorrow.  Not gunna be market moving."
2021-05-10 19:20:01,wallstreetbets,"That argument is fine, but your initial one is so off base that it’s obvious you don’t know what you’re talking about regardless of what you come up with at this point :p

The Q1 results don’t really matter, what matters is what you think will happen in Q2. The company is forecasting sunshine. We will see."
2021-05-10 18:55:54,wallstreetbets,You could do that.  There are also tons of other stocks in the market that will take your money :)

2021-05-10 17:05:59,wallstreetbets,I mean foreclosure and eviction moratoriums. When they drop this UWMC and RKT will go boom.

Everything is a gamble but UWMC is well positioned for what’s coming. This was a good earnings report if you’re long on the stock. It’ll have some ups and downs, but I think it’s the best bet in the industry."
2021-05-10 17:49:46,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t say they were. In fact I said they weren’t buying all those shares back tomorrow in this very thread. I take that as a no, they did not do a buy back lost earnings which is what I asked."
2021-05-10 19:21:42,wallstreetbets,Lol. Sorry to burst your bubble buddy. I understand seasonality. Down 33% is fucking terrible.

2021-05-10 17:56:05,wallstreetbets,I'll take an earnings hit on my stock if it means we don't hurt the poor people who have already been sorely damaged by a disastrous response to COVID in this country. Fuck that.
2021-05-10 17:19:59,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-10 16:59:40,wallstreetbets,"I mean, this is just absurd.

They aren’t exactly the same, particularly regarding refis, but they are both mortgage companies that saw massive benefits from the insane housing market the past year. Just look at their numbers...

Do you believe UWMC reporting astronomical YoY increases is just a coincidence? If not, then how can you possibly believe a cooled off housing market wouldn’t negatively impact them?

Sounds to me UWMC is just predicting the housing boom to last longer than most do, but either way, it very much has had a “rising tide lifts all boats” effect and logic would dictate the opposite to occur when the tide lowers."
2021-05-10 19:34:26,wallstreetbets,"I think it is a pretty bad bet as something that is going to grow a ton short term, but is also very very safe in an otherwise fairly rough market.  Cash is a valid position, and I would prefer cash to this since so many things that will perform better are on sale currently, but you can do much worse than parking your money in something near rock bottom that is paying a dividend."
2021-05-10 18:03:54,wallstreetbets,Your desire for confirmation bias isn’t coming from me.  Enjoy your bags.

2021-05-10 18:45:23,wallstreetbets,"Ranking bagholders based on how annoying they are:

1: GME - Deluded, retarded and clueless. They get triggered by any hint of negativity towards their stock, most have no trading experience. Blindly follow any ‘DD’ that implies the price of GME will go up. What makes them so annoying is how they think everything is a conspiracy that related to the share price of GME. Also the fact that they have somehow tricked themselves into believing the share price of GME is related to the fundamentals. This is probably related to the significant bags most GME apes hold.

2: AMC - These bagholders are annoying because they like to rub it in everyone’s face every time AMC has a spike, telling everyone ‘I told you so’. Also the fact that they think they are supporting a struggling theatre chain, when in reality they are lining the pockets of executives with millions of dollars.

3: PLTR - Not as annoying as other bagholders because they are self depreciating. Some will have invested hundreds of thousands without even knowing what the company does. But the fact that they are so pretentious and are certain it is a good long term investment, when all the stock has done is disappoint makes them somewhat annoying.

4: BB - These bagholders are not annoying, I just feel sorry for them. They seem to be masochists who love seeing red and have resigned themselves to a future of doom and despair as a BB bag holder."

2021-05-10 18:17:27,wallstreetbets,"Selling an adjacent strike against an option you bought earlier in the day, and then watching the price continue moving in the original options favor, is like icing on the cake.

Bought an Apple $128 put earlier in the day. Once I was up about 30% on it I sold short the $127 strike to lock in some profits. 

Now the stock price keeps dropping after hours, meaning I’ll have to buy back the $127 put at a higher price, but it also means my $128 put is going up in value at a slightly higher pace.

In other words I was happy with my 30% gains and when I close the positions tomorrow it might be closer to 35%. The cherry on my option sundae 🍒"

2021-05-10 17:19:51,wallstreetbets,"I said this in the last thread, so I'll repost it:

Look for companies that are very close to the start of the supply chain. Anyone that works directly with the manufacture of raw materials. Raw materials are hard to come by and soon they will be able to charge anything they want.

Entertainment is going to suffer IMO. People will find their basic needs are going to go up in price before they can get an increase in pay. Entertainment budgets are the first to get cut by the average American family. Emerging markets are also likely to lose investments as people try to pour into something more stable.

Once the world gets back on track and we stop encouraging people to sit at home, we will go back to the way things were.

Do your own dd, find some good companies and do your own research. There is still a lot of money out there to be made."

WHY?  Real Rates are going up and higher rarest are poison to overvalued high growth stocks.

2021-05-10 19:37:05,wallstreetbets,This is the likely answer. Rising rates is bad for stocks more dependent on future earnings.  Value is up something like 20% ytd. The shift to value will probably continue for at least a few more months depending on the recovery and Fed policy.

2021-05-10 16:49:45,wallstreetbets,Still enough to sell a covered call against. If you have over 100 shares in any bag you're holding and aren't selling covered calls with it then I really don't know what you're doing.
2021-05-10 17:43:20,wallstreetbets,"Was thinking of buying more but after rkt, sadly I might wait for that 20% drop after they miss earnings."
2021-05-10 18:40:30,wallstreetbets,I’m trying to ignore him. It’s not working. He hates me.
2021-05-10 17:13:37,wallstreetbets,yeah but thats down 15% from pre squeeze price.  Did PLTR get squeezed?
2021-05-10 19:35:19,wallstreetbets,Still can't believe my luck selling at 35.35
2021-05-10 19:15:49,wallstreetbets,bb has been red but still didnt fall 10 days straight

2021-05-10 18:39:54,wallstreetbets,That’s how it’s done. I wasted so much time waiting for dips when I could have been averaging a middle number by buying a share more often. #BoomerLearnings
2021-05-10 17:34:23,wallstreetbets,Cant sell cc's. What if it moons????
2021-05-10 16:52:41,wallstreetbets,Can you explain what you’re talking about? Been trading for about a year and I have no idea what you’re talking about. Thank you kindly in advance if you’re willing to explain that
2021-05-10 17:20:07,wallstreetbets,"I just mean look at them since earnings. They went from $23 to $17 because they missed by a penny. Your only hopes are:

A. Blow out earnings (unlikely)

B. The market decides PLTR has suffered enough and the mildly positive to dogshit earnings they report are priced in.

It's pretty clear that anything but a stellar, once in a decade, earnings beating report cause stocks to drop the day after. The market is at nearly ATH. Your earnings and guidance need to be positive bombshells to see anything good come out of earnings."
2021-05-10 18:42:01,wallstreetbets,My great direct listing trade has gotten fucked by my belief in the company lmao. Was once up almost 300% now I’m in the red 😂
2021-05-10 17:41:49,wallstreetbets,Then you roll your CC up to a higher strike price or out to a further date before it expires.

2021-05-10 16:58:43,wallstreetbets,"I don't think I'd do a good job of thoroughly explaining it, but there's a million videos on YouTube about selling covered calls in order to collect premiums. Literally just search ""selling covered calls"" and you'll be able to find a thorough explanation."
2021-05-10 16:58:33,wallstreetbets,"You're selling a call contract.  If the call isn't exercised, you make the premium.    If it exercises then you'll lose the shares at the contract price."
2021-05-10 18:00:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah but theyd been sitting flat at 22-23$ for a month and the same for months before that.  PLTR has been on a nasty downslope for the last month already
2021-05-10 19:40:20,wallstreetbets,"This is what they are talking about when they say picking stocks inevitably leads to people underperforming index funds. You really only have to fuck it up once if your risk tolerance is high enough.

This isn’t a criticism. As long as you’re putting money into the market, you’ll be better off than most though. Some people’s version of fun is hucking $3,000 into a bet. I get it."
2021-05-10 18:14:12,wallstreetbets,I understand the concept but uh.. I'm just afraid of not being timely with the rolling so I just dont out of fear. I'm in the air force and constantly flying on missions. so if I'm overseas on a mission in an aircraft and miss out on a roll and lose out on gains I would hate myself.
2021-05-10 19:43:01,wallstreetbets,NKLA says hi. I got ass fucked hard when it rallied to $100
2021-05-10 18:15:03,wallstreetbets,Idk why people are investing in pltr for short term gains. It's a long play. But goddamn the crashes suck.
2021-05-10 19:51:15,wallstreetbets,"Nah you’re exactly right, have managed > market returns in my five years of investing but often fuck myself with greed and (impossible) poor attempts at timing."
2021-05-10 19:40:34,wallstreetbets,"First, Thank you for your service! Second, I can’t imagine  MWR or Comm restricting access to brokerage accounts. Too many officers in theater for that. LOL. Daytrading might be out of the question, but swing trading and options would probably be doable. Just call up Comm where you are heading and ask em. #HerkNation. Cheers"
2021-05-10 18:33:04,wallstreetbets,"Just sell them further out. If you sell 6 months out, you should have plenty of time to make any adjustment needed"
2021-05-10 19:57:00,wallstreetbets,Well. Ya invested in NKLA. 😂

I’m buying more on this silly dip"
2021-05-10 17:35:27,wallstreetbets,"This part is mind boggling....

'...28 of 42 (67%) of the participants in the MDMA group no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, compared with 12 of 37 (32%) of those in the placebo group after three sessions.'"
2021-05-10 18:17:13,wallstreetbets,So what does this mean for me as a consumer...what and when can I buy....when I find this out I'll buy back in.
2021-05-10 18:27:55,wallstreetbets,"There is some MDMA-assisted therapy discussion on  /r/mdmatherapy.  It's a nice place to keep track of new developments and the occasional personal story.

2021-05-10 18:22:01,wallstreetbets,A consumer of psychedelics or a retail investor? Or both?
2021-05-10 18:07:44,wallstreetbets,"Drop out in clinical trials is to be expected around 10-15%. If the study was adequately powered and anticipated the drop out, than the minimal differences in group size do not play a role in the results."
2021-05-10 19:14:28,wallstreetbets,It’s pretty safe as long as you don’t take huge doses and wait 3 months between taking it.
2021-05-10 18:25:35,wallstreetbets,Both
2021-05-10 18:53:02,wallstreetbets,"As a consumer, I believe this is medically-assisted so you shouldn’t expect “self exploration” trials to have the same response.

2021-05-10 19:07:02,wallstreetbets,I have a hard time grasping the medicine assistance market and how the plan to grow this industry. But I an open to learning about it.
2021-05-10 19:44:14,wallstreetbets,"Look up ketamine therapy. There's quite a few places that use recreational doses of ketamine to treat PTSD and depression. Being the only hallucinogenic drug already approved and commonly used in humans for decades, K therapy is probably the closest thing we have to what MindMed is working toward. I'd assume other hallucinogens will be used in a similar fashion once they are more widely excepted for medical use."
2021-05-10 18:11:57,wallstreetbets,At least you bought shares of PLTR and not calls like me...
2021-05-10 16:04:04,wallstreetbets,Holy shit it's that low? Guess whose gonna lose money on PLTR again tomorrow. 🙋‍♀️

I got in around $1400 so it's pretty easy for me to just keep holding. I did buy about 30 shares as well when it was at $2300 fyi.

2021-05-10 19:32:43,wallstreetbets,"interesting perspective, thanks.  AI-based underwriting is definitely not new, probably one of the biggest bear case points here is the difficulty of pitching large banks to go with someone else' AI models, vs their own internal data science teams.   out of the 20 other companies, who would you say is leading, and why?"

2021-05-10 19:18:20,wallstreetbets,"that's the thing though, they are generating real alpha from their AI models, vs most anyone else claiming to do AI to ride the hype wave.  UPST is a pure tech play - they don't actually lend anyone any money, they make money by selling their ""true credit risk"" AI-driven platform to banks and institutions who do.   if their AI models were junk, why would the banks they partner with use them to make the final decision on over $9B in loans in 2020?   especially in the sub-prime market where a higher default rate means very sharp $$$ losses for the underwriters.  the # of loans transacted on their platform is 300K in 2020 and has been growing at a 62% CAGR over the past 3 years."
2021-05-10 19:47:07,wallstreetbets,"First of all there is no AI based underwriting anywhere, at least not in US. 
AI is the latest buzzword and everyone is piling on the bandwagon. What these companies are doing is ML based underwriting models but there is no AI ( the models don’t adjust themselves.
I dont think there is a clear winner right now- all the banks have teams of people working on building ML models, in addition to numerous Fintechs and other start ups doing the same.
In my bank we have a large internal team doing this stuff, we are also working with 3 Fintech/Start ups who are doing ‘proof of concept’ to prove out their capabilities- so far I have seen marginal improvements over the traditional logistic regression models that we have been using for  decades. Basically AI is mostly BS - at least so far for credit underwriting"

Currently the price is around $219. The May 21 calls don’t have much time left, you’ll need a good rally for those to payoff. For the November call, you need a price of $234.15 or better to cover the strike price plus the amount paid for the premium.

2021-05-10 15:18:17,wallstreetbets,Just saw that after every Q earnings it drops like a motherfucker. Fingers crossed it's gonna go different this time
2021-05-10 15:26:59,wallstreetbets,I'm buying it only at 16.34$ 🤨 and then hold for few months
2021-05-10 17:06:39,wallstreetbets,No it won't

2021-05-10 15:19:54,wallstreetbets,Wish I would I waited. Bought at high 19. Earnings will print
2021-05-10 17:07:32,wallstreetbets,I hope so 💀
2021-05-10 17:56:40,wallstreetbets,I’m giving everything I got. It’s still not enough. 🥲
2021-05-10 19:32:02,wallstreetbets,Alright so wsb doesn't like your chances. That means the odds are most likely in your favor. Plus insane call volumes today.
2021-05-10 17:04:53,wallstreetbets,"Hahahahahhaha same. I enjoyed buying at $37 so much I’m waiting to load more there. 4,400 and cash for the ATH."
2021-05-10 19:53:53,wallstreetbets,Bro I hope you're selling covered calls on those 3000 shares jeez. At least collect some premium while you hold them bags.
2021-05-10 17:05:46,wallstreetbets,Right - damn.

2021-05-10 15:19:06,wallstreetbets,"How about sell your sperms, and blood?"
2021-05-10 17:06:37,wallstreetbets,"The rumor is that this will be their first profitable quarter, but today’s trading day pretty much guaranteed shit earnings"

2021-05-10 18:11:30,wallstreetbets,Which years earnings will print?  I'm thinkin Q3 2025

2021-05-10 18:07:18,wallstreetbets,Didn't BlackRock just buy like 3 million shares last week?

2021-05-10 18:13:24,wallstreetbets,To the moooooon!!!!!
2021-05-10 17:45:37,wallstreetbets,Amc rising fast rn ?👀
2021-05-10 16:57:45,wallstreetbets,Why is amc so demonized on wsb? I see retarded plays every day here that people jump off a cliff for but mention amc and it's a firing squad 15 paces down range for you.
2021-05-10 18:46:17,wallstreetbets,So it’s actually happening
2021-05-10 18:18:40,wallstreetbets,Is this the reason why AMC took off in after hours trading?
2021-05-10 18:04:50,wallstreetbets,Can someone be nice for this ape and explain in simple terms what this means?
2021-05-10 17:17:52,wallstreetbets,SHEEEESH ALHAMDULILAH

2021-05-10 15:07:49,wallstreetbets,Let's see how long it takes for this to get deleted from WSB...
2021-05-10 19:48:26,wallstreetbets,"You're gonna mislead all the retards here with your title. The SI is not skyrocketing, the cost to borrow (the borrow rate) is rising. The Ortex post referenced by OP-tard says SI is 23.75%"
2021-05-10 19:31:43,wallstreetbets,"Good, i want to become millionaire since January 2021."
2021-05-10 15:57:43,wallstreetbets,It’s just a matter of time
2021-05-10 17:08:44,wallstreetbets,"I'm confused, isn't the short interest right there? 23.75%? It's not over 100%, it's just up 149% from 14.47? 

Am I crazy here?"
2021-05-10 18:15:21,wallstreetbets,U mean ... bear hunting season is coming?? Haaaa
2021-05-10 19:35:58,wallstreetbets,I knew that something like this would be coming. Ape of stonk war I liftoff talking. We’ve been there and seen that. Next posts will be about Nokia and BB 😉
2021-05-10 19:31:24,wallstreetbets,SI is 27% as of this morning on the Bkack App.
2021-05-10 18:36:25,wallstreetbets,You know this is legit since there were no posts hyping this at all over the weekend or last week. There is a very real chance of a gamma squeeze/short squeeze this week.
2021-05-10 15:10:07,wallstreetbets,Sheeeesshh!
2021-05-10 18:19:36,wallstreetbets,Pushing AMC hard while GME gets killed. They ll probably let AMC squeeze even if it means losing a shitload of money just to try to get people out of GME. All the best to AMC holders but dont forget what the real target is here
2021-05-10 17:02:14,wallstreetbets,Is RH stealing from the poor and giving to the rich ? 🤔 I need out **
2021-05-10 17:29:43,wallstreetbets,Ext Robinhood before the squeeze or you’ll see due to heavy traffic du to high trading volume we are not able to execute your sell order bit bot when I was a young boy from Bulgaria
2021-05-10 16:52:51,wallstreetbets,So sad what GME has done to this sub. Everyone thinks short interest is some magic ticket to finding undervalued stocks and easy gains
2021-05-10 19:45:52,wallstreetbets,Repeat
2021-05-10 18:16:58,wallstreetbets,"Is it possible.... and stay with me here.... that there is a reason for the shorting?

Pls no downvotes."
2021-05-10 19:34:27,wallstreetbets,PSA: short interest is not a positive indicator- that being said I’m retarded so I’m in
2021-05-10 15:09:50,wallstreetbets,Idk why but they aren't allowing amc posts on wsb
2021-05-10 18:48:49,wallstreetbets,I really believe everyone must stop and shut it down amc or gme it's the same fight together we have to stop making this jealous little girl with her stock and rage when it's not going on the other stock we are together and the people who continuing their little war of stocks are no better than the hf
2021-05-10 19:43:37,wallstreetbets,The 🩳 must 🛌

2021-05-10 18:19:17,wallstreetbets,You know there is a reason people short a company right?
2021-05-10 16:01:33,wallstreetbets,Should I sell a portion of gme to buy amc now? Or does it not matter
2021-05-10 19:09:53,wallstreetbets,"A WHOPPING 23% SI. Trust the plan guys, it will squeeze any day now along with the arrest of Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden 😂😂😂"
2021-05-10 17:34:55,wallstreetbets,"The fuds are strong in this comment section, I’m not selling until at least 20"
2021-05-10 18:27:24,wallstreetbets,"You know it was funny for the first few weeks, but now this is getting a bit depressing. AMC wasn’t even doing good BEFORE the pandemic, what makes you all think things will change?"
2021-05-10 15:10:15,wallstreetbets,"A tweet that leads to a subscription service. This is some great news and I hope it gets deleted.    

Edit: lol op replied to me but didn't have the balls to keep up the reply 😎"
2021-05-10 17:47:29,wallstreetbets,As it should. The company is bankrupt.
2021-05-10 19:23:15,wallstreetbets,AMC is dogshit
2021-05-10 15:23:57,wallstreetbets,Learn to read retards. It’s not skyrocketing.
2021-05-10 18:32:31,wallstreetbets,What’s GMEs short interest?
2021-05-10 19:11:17,wallstreetbets,I still don’t understand why the short interest is higher on amc than it is on GME.
2021-05-10 19:28:40,wallstreetbets,Are they still restricting trades of certain stocks? And by trades I mean buying
2021-05-10 19:55:48,wallstreetbets,Lets goooooooooo
2021-05-10 15:29:23,wallstreetbets,Someone has the info on their possible bankruptcy filing.  Godspeed retards.
2021-05-10 15:25:27,wallstreetbets,Shit you think it’s bad on AMC HMBL it’s literally getting CRUSHED by shorts!  Never seen anything this bad.  Bottom line shorts are making all the money across the board!  Biden is a shorter himself haha

2021-05-10 18:29:36,wallstreetbets,They just bought 27 million yesterday
2021-05-10 18:46:40,wallstreetbets,"yes, BlackRock’s passive index funds bought shares- likely due to inflows."
2021-05-10 15:25:11,wallstreetbets,Plane flying over Citadel right now
2021-05-10 15:19:35,wallstreetbets,Freedom of speech  in space☆☆
2021-05-10 17:14:35,wallstreetbets,I think because the executives gave themselves fat bonuses rather than spend money on adapting their biz
2021-05-10 17:21:54,wallstreetbets,"AMC isn't doing anything to justify investing in the company.  GME is actually doing a shut ton of work to restructure the company.

Honestly the short interests are right with regards to amc."

It’s my least favorite movie theater by me"

And the apes loved them for it lmao"

2021-05-10 18:42:37,wallstreetbets,Hedge funds are paying up the ass to short AMC.  Its not sustainable and it is a good indicator of when a squeeze will occur. I.e. GME
2021-05-10 15:11:53,wallstreetbets,It was posted by Ortex so yeah.
2021-05-10 15:37:41,wallstreetbets,Your post has been removed.
2021-05-10 15:08:49,wallstreetbets,Like 10 seconds. SMH.  Fucking WSB is owned by Citadel
2021-05-10 17:24:20,wallstreetbets,Short interest for AMC is currently at 70%
2021-05-10 18:27:53,wallstreetbets,Nope it is 70%
2021-05-10 19:03:13,wallstreetbets,Most of us are holding both LOOL
2021-05-10 18:34:18,wallstreetbets,I have GME as well.  I’m not selling either.
2021-05-10 18:33:09,wallstreetbets,Ummm yes.  I switched to Webull last week.  Couldn’t be happier.
2021-05-10 17:50:32,wallstreetbets,it was a pretty neat trick the first time ngl
2021-05-10 18:45:21,wallstreetbets,There's multiple reasons like failure to delivers increased for AMC went from 400k to 2.7 million in April. Blackpool shares oversaturation in the market. Hedge funds like blackrock with an amazing track record increased shares to 21 million. But no fundamentals at play
2021-05-10 17:49:43,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, the vast majority of the time, an increase in short interest will mean that the stock is going to fall. Gme was such an outlier event, it will take a long time for it to be replicated."
2021-05-10 18:44:23,wallstreetbets,it is trading close to all time high market cap right about now…
2021-05-10 18:40:54,wallstreetbets,They don’t want it to get traction/bring the price down and the moral.   Use to work back in the day but not after GME.  Now it’s like a “hey look at me WSB bull flag”.
2021-05-10 15:17:58,wallstreetbets,One word: FEAR.
2021-05-10 17:02:24,wallstreetbets,"Because there are more than 2 stocks in the market, and GME and AMC are both ridiculously overvalued companies with poor business models.

23.75% short interest isn’t even close to enough to trigger a squeeze."
2021-05-10 18:38:47,wallstreetbets,The same reason they shorted GME right?
2021-05-10 18:32:40,wallstreetbets,To crash down company to the ground to make some.buck
2021-05-10 16:08:24,wallstreetbets,omg no!
2021-05-10 16:46:16,wallstreetbets,No amc and gme diamonds stock
2021-05-10 18:27:03,wallstreetbets,"Yes, amc to the moon. Watch people fomo into it lol"
2021-05-10 16:30:56,wallstreetbets,Yes! AMC to the moon
2021-05-10 19:17:18,wallstreetbets,most people here can’t read and think the SI is 70%
2021-05-10 19:41:44,wallstreetbets,"You mean first few months... Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining I'm selling the apes covered calls and making a profit"
2021-05-10 18:42:28,wallstreetbets,19% of the float
2021-05-10 19:27:31,wallstreetbets,AMC has the most cash on hand in its entire history. Movie theaters are opening up... What the hell are you talking about?
2021-05-10 15:35:10,wallstreetbets,Do you believe any of this? It's a penny stock that was valued less than .01 six months ago. Now it's $1.20.
2021-05-10 15:42:35,wallstreetbets,It literally does you fuck

2021-05-10 18:51:36,wallstreetbets,Here in America it is just called Market.
2021-05-10 18:21:34,wallstreetbets,You can just say US market
2021-05-10 19:49:49,wallstreetbets,Join the amc stock sub reddit and you'll get any information you feel you might be missing
2021-05-10 17:44:10,wallstreetbets,Until AMC goes bankrupt.
2021-05-10 18:31:00,wallstreetbets,On Sunday? Regardless it looks like they dried up a lot of the float hence why we are seeing borrowing fees sky rocket on AMC.
2021-05-10 18:32:45,wallstreetbets,21 million

2021-05-10 19:32:14,wallstreetbets,Those ware under last year contract that had to be fulfilled
2021-05-10 19:02:09,wallstreetbets,"They are getting into VR and opening up theaters specifically for it in malls- dunno how well it’ll work, but they are trying new things."
2021-05-10 19:42:49,wallstreetbets,If you think anyone at this point is investing in either company on economic fundamentals you missed the memo. It’s about more than a company’s outlook it’s about how HFs fucked over so many people and revenge
2021-05-10 18:39:00,wallstreetbets,I mean gme business model is more dead then movie theaters what with valve/online vendors owning majority of the market
2021-05-10 17:31:36,wallstreetbets,I appreciate your insight. Yeah there's only so much you can do to improve a movie theater experience.
2021-05-10 19:55:09,wallstreetbets,Fuck you.
2021-05-10 18:25:26,wallstreetbets,Oh well buddy 🥱🥱🥱🥱
2021-05-10 17:46:03,wallstreetbets,Reasonable point yeah. I feel it's as people who missed out on gamestop want a redemption from amc

2021-05-10 15:09:23,wallstreetbets,Yup can't post AMC on this junk
2021-05-10 18:25:02,wallstreetbets,It’s at 22%. 70% is the borrow rate.
2021-05-10 18:18:16,wallstreetbets,Was at like 30 something earlier this year right?
2021-05-10 19:15:55,wallstreetbets,that is the borrow rate. borrow rate ≠ short interest % float.
2021-05-10 17:57:19,wallstreetbets,Well the last mont AMC short interest went from 70M to 150M. Aaand all it did was trading sideways
2021-05-10 15:18:51,wallstreetbets,You guys are such baby dick energy.
2021-05-10 17:24:12,wallstreetbets,You are right about AMC.  GME is doing a fuck ton of work to change their business model.  They forced out several board members and csuite execs in the last few months.
2021-05-10 17:27:38,wallstreetbets,*70% short interest right now and that’s why it’s strange WSB doesn’t know
2021-05-10 17:42:30,wallstreetbets,Glad you are so well versed on GME's business model or you really could've looked like a fool making this statement.
2021-05-10 16:09:25,wallstreetbets,"Thank God. I've been trying to figure out if it's worth it, thank you internet friend"
2021-05-10 19:20:04,wallstreetbets,No they think it’s 149% while not understanding that it is only the APR of the interest charged for shorting the stock which rapidly fluctuates. It’s even worse actually
2021-05-10 15:36:32,wallstreetbets,It wasn’t Humbl 6 months ago it was a flooring company.  Take a look at the short interest it’s nuts.  I’ve been in 3 months been wild ride.

2021-05-10 17:21:01,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-10 18:50:11,wallstreetbets,This is why they are changing it; in addition to AMC's business model being absolutely garbage with no intent to change. Who the fuck wants to pay $8 for a fucking soda?
2021-05-10 18:58:14,wallstreetbets,AMC is actually doing things to improve their model. They spent a lot of money recently on their streaming platform. I know they're many players in the streaming industry but this is definitely another source of revenue.
2021-05-10 17:44:41,wallstreetbets,"Possibly, but AMC leadership paid itself bonuses instead of trying new ideas."
2021-05-10 16:52:52,wallstreetbets,🤫
2021-05-10 18:25:17,wallstreetbets,it’s currently at 22%. 70% is the borrow rate
2021-05-10 19:56:54,wallstreetbets,"it went up 34% from mid to late april

and down 25% from its peak to the lowest it fell.

But yeah; its totally trading sideways you fucking idiot. 

3 dollars is a big % when it comes to a stock thats 9 or 1o dollars.


Jesus fucking Christ."
2021-05-10 16:42:25,wallstreetbets,But it’s gonna get to 100mil a share and we’re all gonna be rich bro come one retarded ape done be a 🌈 🐻 🚀 🌚
2021-05-10 17:44:17,wallstreetbets,"I have seen GME’s attempts to rebrand, but what do you think they’re going to do?

If you actually play video games you’ll notice that almost all platforms are transitioning to online purchases, but not via 3rd part vendors; the purchases are within the console’s online store.

What is GameStop going to do to compete with that? Eventually consoles won’t even have disk drives for physical games. They can’t compete with the prices in the console stores. Are they planning to transition to a PC build vendor or something?"
2021-05-10 17:41:46,wallstreetbets,"The tweet here says 23.75%

It literally says “estimated short interest: 23.75% of FF” FF means free float, otherwise known as the existing, currently tradeable stock."
2021-05-10 16:26:02,wallstreetbets,"Time out , ape here.....why not take out small % of GME.   AMC has not gone to moon yet? 2nd shortest stock in 🇺🇸 and 🦍 keeping buying and holding"
2021-05-10 16:09:46,wallstreetbets,"You bought during a meme bubble. It's probably not going back up. Sorry for the bad news. To be fair, I haven't done any DD on the company, but there's a lot of similar charts on WSB since GME"
2021-05-10 18:02:34,wallstreetbets,Keep holding
2021-05-10 18:29:03,wallstreetbets,Ya is freaking hilarious.

2021-05-10 19:01:58,wallstreetbets,"Who wants to pay 30$ for a steak at a restaurant? People enjoy going out, who wants to see ghost busters afterlife on a small screen? Digital game marketplace is already oversaturated, I have not seen anything that would set them apart from the competition"
2021-05-10 19:06:15,wallstreetbets,"I mean there's so many options right now for e-commerce. It took best buy almost 10 years to get out of the hole they were in. I'm 10 more years, everyone will continue to grow and innovate while gamestop is stuck playing catchup. AMC isn't in a much better spot, but at least they are their market leader, I think if they tried to make their own movie studio and in-house streaming service, that would trendously help"
2021-05-10 19:55:57,wallstreetbets,"You thinking of AMCX, homie?"
2021-05-10 18:37:21,wallstreetbets,You’re getting downvoted because it’s true!
2021-05-10 18:30:26,wallstreetbets,"Holy crap. That is, a lot."
2021-05-10 18:33:57,wallstreetbets,No you're wrong. Borrow fee just peaked at 73.2% before shares ran out. Hasn't been in the 20s for hours. Cost to borrow is <140%.
2021-05-10 16:42:32,wallstreetbets,/s
2021-05-10 17:46:16,wallstreetbets,"They aren't trying to keep physical games.  It kinda looks like they are looking to replace steam or epuc games store and sell a bunch of gaming related products via online service similar to chewy with pet supplies.  That's just a guess on my part though.

Removing board members and c level executives isn't done for rebranding."
2021-05-10 16:56:51,wallstreetbets,"Because GME is the **most** shorted stock! Do whatever you want, I'm not your fianacial advisor."
2021-05-10 18:26:02,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-10 17:25:28,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-10 19:11:42,wallstreetbets,Who really has a small screen anymore? You can get a 65 inch brand new Samsung smart tv on a payment plan from best buy. With shit credit. The people who pay 30 for a steak are people who like to eat out; a real comparison would be who likes paying 90 for a steak? People who can afford it. Who populates most of this country? People who CANNOT afford a 90 dollar steak.
2021-05-10 19:08:35,wallstreetbets,"Do you not see the all star staffing their working on? AMC may be market leader, but it's in a post covid world. We will not be returning to the world or life you knew before, I'm sorry to say. Movie theaters will be going down, and drive in theaters will be going up."
2021-05-10 18:41:27,wallstreetbets,I’m talking about short intrest%float. Short intrest is in 20s. Cost of borrow is in 70s. Two different things.
2021-05-10 18:34:16,wallstreetbets,And then?
2021-05-10 17:26:09,wallstreetbets,"I was referring to this

>Where there’s smoke there’s bound to be fire."
2021-05-10 19:22:28,wallstreetbets,"Yes a 65"" tv is the same as a 60 foot screen. Food is optional,  My local AMC affiliate theater ticket price is 6$ for a matinee so unaffordable, or you can rent out a screen for a party now. I spend like 20$ at the theater ticket 6$ 2 beers 14$, just because there hiring an ""all-star"" staff doesn't equal results."
2021-05-10 19:15:54,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps AMC eventually enters the drive-in movie theater market. Hell, they already have the real estate to do it right on their existing properties...

(Edit: Left some words out)"
2021-05-10 19:12:24,wallstreetbets,"For sure I think amc has a ton of work and there's a lot of work to do. Tons of company that has tried to come back has hired big names as well, some has work and some has not. I hope gamestop and amc succeeds, but I think there's a low chance. Like even right now, why shop at gamestop vs any other place. Retailers might put up that gamers club deal thing again, remember when they had that and gamestop couldn't put out something similar?"
2021-05-10 19:00:46,wallstreetbets,Factually inaccurate

2021-05-10 19:55:02,wallstreetbets,Some people don’t want to see the other side of a conversation. Let her be
2021-05-10 19:05:21,wallstreetbets,"Source? Short Intrest as a % of float doesn’t change daily. The 70s% number that you are referring to is borrow fee, the cost to borrow the shares to short. The 22% number that I am referring to is the short interest as a % of the float."
2021-05-10 17:32:26,wallstreetbets,Oh hey how's it going
2021-05-10 17:38:54,wallstreetbets,"Bro he deleted his comment lol

Did you recover all good from that drinking over the weekend"
2021-05-10 17:57:15,wallstreetbets,Im exhausted as fuck tbh. And bowling today was horrible since I now have problems with my wrist tendons. At least I’ve made money at work right 🤡 Also rent is due in 6 days and that honestly gives me strength. I can’t wait to buy my 3rd rental property soon🤤

2021-05-10 18:30:53,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know how it is compared to you, but I pay 34% on income but I’m not sure what I can deduct. All I know is I have to reinvest the gains in even more properties so I can write that as an expense and have it deducted"
2021-05-10 18:41:08,wallstreetbets,"34% is similar to what I pay, sadly the Govt is making a change to how you can deduct taxes on housing here so I've decided to reconsider buying a house 🤡"
2021-05-10 18:46:05,wallstreetbets,Are you not going to buy house or are you going to?
2021-05-10 18:49:35,wallstreetbets,"Gunna chill and watch the market for a bit, see how it reacts to the changes"

2021-05-10 16:01:28,wallstreetbets,"P/E of 14?!? And a 2% dividend?  Bell jist closed, but Im in for it tomorrow"
2021-05-10 14:50:20,wallstreetbets,"There’s a tendie shortage in the US (and probably the world) currently. Investing in a primarily chicken based company may help them keep their employees paid. Idk, not proficient in the economy like that."
2021-05-10 15:43:11,wallstreetbets,"I agree, I think as tech/growth equities start to falter from their all-time high valuations and some sort of reality sets in, the natural rotation is into commodities and consumer staples like Tyson as inflation looms. To compound this, many fast food and retail jobs are not able to hire due to people applying for the positions, no-showing to interviews, and claiming unemployment benefits because they are technically looking for work. Fast food might need to raise prices to generate a wage that can attract workers and more people may end up still cooking at home, both pushing chicken demand up. I’m bullish (beefish?) on poultry."
2021-05-10 17:59:06,wallstreetbets,"Food stocks make me nervous. 

I feel like every week I hear about something being contaminated with e.coli or salmonella.

2021-05-10 16:30:47,wallstreetbets,You had the sub at  anal dysplasia.
2021-05-10 15:40:00,wallstreetbets,Lost count how many INO posts there have been in this echo chamber the last day or two.
2021-05-10 16:39:10,wallstreetbets,"How is it that these are amazing phase 2 results, the GMT with vaccine were lower than even convalescent plasma ?  Is it really providing enough protection? 

Doesnt the data cast more shadow on the success of P3 study efficacy?"
2021-05-10 15:38:30,wallstreetbets,"Ino sucks. Been following in since last April. Lost 8k on it. Kim never fucking releases full study reports and INO's marketing department suck. Which means they are incompetent or have shit results.

Usa have more than enough covid vaccines and the rest of the world has multiple successful ones. Ino doesn't even have the manufacturing capacity to scale up in time."
2021-05-10 15:00:11,wallstreetbets,"An amazing external funding announcement would normally mean a partner buying in and to say that prior to closing is just dumb.  Almost sounds like trying to manipulate share price.  I just began buying Friday after doing 2-3 weeks of DD (due diligence) I’ll buy more or buy Calls soon. I’ve also read they tend to promise much and not deliver, that’s a real concern"
2021-05-10 18:57:33,wallstreetbets,"Bought in the 3s, sold half in the mid 20s, sold the rest at 8. They lost the race so I can't see this thing taking off."

2021-05-10 18:38:28,wallstreetbets,"Kim is the worst and they need to lose him. Based on results the vaccine is legit and not only is better (efficacy + ease of storage) but only like 5% of the world is actually vaccinated. It also has been shown to be more effective against variants - the longer this goes on the important that is... with the funding issues it will be used in rural China, India, Africa and parts of South America . The USA is not the market for this right now unless variants take control. You’re right that US has enough right now- their problem is that not enough people are taking it and they have surplus however they also are refusing to export it ...

Bear case: INO are awful for bringing a product to market- like literally the worst so there’s no confidence there at all . However they have some interesting and promising things in the pipeline other than this Covid vaccine so there’s a buffer there"
2021-05-10 15:49:40,wallstreetbets,"I agree that Kim isn’t doing the company any good, but aside from their vaccine I’m more interested in there VGX-3100 and their advancement in treating brain cancer."

2021-05-10 15:10:43,wallstreetbets,There is no way they get bought out in the next few months.
2021-05-10 16:21:46,wallstreetbets,"I can see a co announcing they’re going to do a secondary in advance or a bond offering but to say “an external funding” what else can it be? I also would believe that an agreement must already be signed because if whatever it is falls through after saying what he said it would kill his credibility and hurt share price, would also lead to questions about “what did the other party see to cause the deal to die” if you know of a different option I’m missing let me know, and I mean that.  If earnings are bad (and they were) but you’re telling investors and analysts that there’s a knight out there who’s giving us money so a loss isn’t relevant that’ll put some floor under the shares, that COULD be read as manipulative, just clarifying what I meant."
2021-05-10 18:07:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, just not INO."

2021-05-10 15:20:41,wallstreetbets,"Because I love biotech, and finance. I’ll take any opportunity to talk about it. I also don’t want to see people lose money. Plus, out of any biotech stock I’ve ever made a counterpoint on I’ve never received more hate than I have from INO holders. Seriously, y’all need to take a chill pill."
2021-05-10 16:28:02,wallstreetbets,You didn’t by “you’re” I’m referring to CEO
2021-05-10 15:41:28,wallstreetbets,You dont want to see people lose money. Mate you’re in the wrong business. If you are gaining there is always someone losing on the other end.
2021-05-10 15:23:03,wallstreetbets,"Please pick my brain on why it won’t be bought out in the next few months, I bet the reason you get contradicted so hard is because you have no evidence to back up your claim other than “I love biotech and finances” like every other ape here."
2021-05-10 15:43:18,wallstreetbets,Considering I’m long on nearly every biotech position (1-5 years) the only people losing money are those who are shorting it. Should I feel bad for them?
2021-05-10 15:29:26,wallstreetbets,"I mean why is it so hard to believe that I love biotech, and finance? Kind of hard to talk to a lot of people about that IRL. Trust me when I say that I've tried. 

Well for one targeting acquisitions is a viable strategy in biotech. But, it almost never happens until a drug is approved. They still have a long way to go before that. Not saying it wont happen eventually. But, no way is it happening in the next 30-90 days. Second, I do try to provide sources on just about everything I post. What constitutes evidence to you? I'm happy to oblige."
2021-05-10 15:48:36,wallstreetbets,Show me your evidence that leads you to believe that they won’t make a deal with a company in the next 30 days?
2021-05-10 15:56:09,wallstreetbets,"How am I supposed to provide evidence for something where no evidence exists in the first place? Just googling “inovio buyout”, “inovio buyout Regeneron”, “inovio acquisition”, or “inovio acquisition Regeneron” doesn’t yield any credible information that’s recent. The only place I’ve seen it has only been on r/inovio, and this sub. Mind if I ask for your evidence?"
2021-05-10 16:06:55,wallstreetbets,Then I wouldn’t say “There is no way they get bought out in the next few months.” With such confidence.
2021-05-10 16:10:26,wallstreetbets,"I mean sure, but do you not fail to see the irony that I can say the same thing about your statement?

If it doesn’t happen you don’t have to pay anything, but have the right to call me a dumbass. Does that work?"

2021-05-10 16:13:52,wallstreetbets,Guess we will see what happens in the next 30-90 days and we’ll see who’s right

2021-05-10 19:23:33,wallstreetbets,"Not sure what you mean? There's a difference between developing technology and implementing it. Fiber Optic cable was invented in the 50's, finally used for telecommunications in the 70's, and is still being rolled out. 

The race isn't developing the newest technology first, the race is implementing 5G on a robust and new telecom infrastructure that companies will eventually have to use, and the US Gov has demonstrated that they want Nokia to head the 5G rollout. Nokia has the third largest telecommunications network in the world.

That being, said the 5G rollout is going to be incredibly fast comparatively on account of it being a wireless technology and being spurred by IoT, edge computing, the cloud, teleworking, and yeah speculation of 6G. Not to mention, (SPECUALTION), I can totally see the US Gov getting its hands in implementing a 5G network because it will absolutely be needed for pole position. 

Huawei will not have any part in the rollout of 5G in the US or among US companies abroad/Companies that deal with US companies abroad due to very well founded allegations of espionage and them being ruled security threats by the US Government and many of its allies.

I've been buying Old Navy, Gap and Banana Republic for about 20 years and I've noticed a significant decline in quality across the board. I'd say I used to return at least 50% of items I purchase from there before giving up completely. I also find myself donating a lot of stuff I buy from there.

Their sizing is completely wack, I usually need to order 3 or 4 of the same item just to figure out what's going to fit. They're constantly running weird gimmicky sales and rewards system (supercash?) that usually only apply to the deeply discounted janky items that nobody wants. The quality of their fabric has just gotten worse. Hey, maybe this is a business model that works for them but as a consumer it's a dumpster fire.

I will say that the athletic apparel from Gap/ON is dece if on sale. Also sometimes I will buy something from Old Navy if I need an emergency pair of pants for a funeral or something and don't want to spend more than $30.

OP should not find any solace in this comment; I would hope he is still as clueless as the rest of us. One thing I would say, is that whatever has happened over the past 5+ years, we are staring down the barrel of runaway inflation. Continued inflation would see the market continue to rise. Ideally, the fed would like to curtail inflation but the only way to do so is by raising rates. The fed cannot raise rates due to the amount of unaffordable debt this would create for themselves. Therefore, inflation keeps on running hot. Until the day they do raise rates, I can't see a significant crash. Maybe some blips and recoveries but nothing like a true market crash can come until they raise rates. I for one am long gold and uranium watching this thing heat up, ready to jump ship once it crashes. The good thing about gold is I have time to exit my position and not watch it crash 40% in a day. The good thing about uranium is that the structural deficit in the market leads me to believe it will largely unaffected by other market forces until we see that $60 uranium spot price."

Why does this seem strange to you, but companies being at ath while on a lockdown/pandemic is accepted as normal? Stock market and economy are not necessarily related.

These companies thrived during a pandemic, what do you think they’re going to do with an open market?

Your entire thesis is built around the errant idea that the market is over inflated And you were trying to justify that with hypothetical future scenarios that the market is not showing signs of ever producing.

2021-05-10 13:18:14,wallstreetbets,"MDMA has been studied in psychotherapy since the 70s. I remember reading an article about it from Harvard in 11-12, that spoke of its treatment for PTSD and its effectiveness. Psychopharmacology is difficult because of the complexities of mental illness. Generally, PTSD is a notoriously difficult condition to prescribe for. If a small dose can be administered and lasts but as long as a therapy session, it'd be the ideal drug for the condition. (I'm oversimplifiying a lot here)

The non-hallucinogenic psilocybin also seems to have promising effects and has already been legalized for medical use in Oregon, if other states follow suit, it could be big business. 

As someone in the medical field, I do see a future with these products. Which companies have the bets products, I don't know."
2021-05-10 13:12:00,wallstreetbets,"Its been said a million times. This industry will take years. But, since the market is forward looking I believe there will be short term spikes in prices like we seen with cannabis back in 2018."

2021-05-10 13:08:24,wallstreetbets,"It’s probably a fad. And even if it isn’t, growing psilocybin mushrooms is painfully easy so it’ll be extremely hard for any one company to corner the market."

2021-05-10 13:33:33,wallstreetbets,LSD really isn’t that hard. DMT is incredibly easy. Growing shrooms also incredibly easy
2021-05-10 13:18:06,wallstreetbets,"They’re both easy for labs to make and there is no patent, so, again, no one has the market cornered.

And mindful that these treatments will be niche, they cannot be even remotely compared to the legalization of recreational cannabis."
2021-05-10 13:23:01,wallstreetbets,"If the drugs are legalized for medicinal use, two things will likely occur:

- the market for the drugs will be open to whomever is able to safely and properly manufacture them, as none of the published methods for producing them is subject to patent; and

- treaters who are licenced to administer them will almost certainly not be bound by pre-established, marketed treatment plans.

So I don’t see how you can pin down one company as the future in psychedelics. 

Factor in the fact it’s not granted that these will be more than a fad, that they’ll even obtain widespread approval across the West, and that they’ll probably remain niche at best and there is not an environment for serious earnings.

EDIT: I’ll just add that I think this is all really interesting and I hope these drugs help a lot of people. But from an investing perspective, I’m not confident."
2021-05-10 13:38:32,wallstreetbets,">treaters who are licenced to administer them will almost certainly not be bound by pre-established, marketed treatment plans.

I was referring more to ensuring appropriate dosage (as there will be regulations in place) rather than specified treatment plans but I see your point

>So I don’t see how you can pin down one company as the future in psychedelics.

Not trying to pin down a single company. Curious to know people's (hopefully informed) opinions on investing potential

Honestly, after her Tesla evalution a couple weeks/months ago, i thought she started to be delusional to think the Tech Sector will just grow indefinately and also her last choices (Workhorse wtf?) have been really fitting our subreddit...

So yeah, imo Cathie is done and i also have popcorn ready, because the coming implosion will have so many salty tears, i cant wait.

Look up any of their poorly timed entries and bagholds. They took a huge L on FSLY recently. No five year horizon on that.

2021-05-10 19:46:05,wallstreetbets,Just saying there's a lot of paper handed pussies in here!
2021-05-10 18:28:44,wallstreetbets,Like a REIT or actual real estate? Houses out here sell within 24 hours and often cash offers where they waive home inspection. Pretty nuts!

2021-05-10 17:17:12,wallstreetbets,was buying calls that dumb? so many people buy calls
2021-05-10 17:04:05,wallstreetbets,Right? It’s all just numbers.

2021-05-10 19:48:34,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this a casino with a Wendy’s inside of it."
2021-05-10 15:52:21,wallstreetbets,Then you didn’t do your own research bro  🔬
2021-05-10 19:09:34,wallstreetbets,"Go look at the historical chart of any great growth stock, they all have periods where they look like “dogshit.” Every single one of them."
2021-05-10 19:29:51,wallstreetbets,"Tesla was a stupidly easy buy in 2019. Before that it was luck. After that it was just pure stupidity for anyone that didn't buy in, especially for anyone alive during Apple's rise to prominence."
2021-05-10 17:27:58,wallstreetbets,Why keep buying? They don't make any money...  This is not a startup. They've had plenty of time to become profitable. Why do you think they went public? To offload shit shares onto the  public.
2021-05-10 14:53:52,wallstreetbets,yea but that just means u can buy more shares. cant wait the wednesday dip and i can buy more at 15 or less !
2021-05-10 16:40:06,wallstreetbets,Just keep buying til it stops coming up red.
2021-05-10 16:30:58,wallstreetbets,"Got me there bro, but I am definitely up overall this yr"
2021-05-10 19:11:19,wallstreetbets,"Been dealing with that market down in Atlanta. It’s insane. All contingencies waived, offers well over asking, cash in a lot of cases. No way it continues but knowing my luck it’ll last just until we buy."
2021-05-10 19:11:36,wallstreetbets,"I bought 160 acres of pasture that I’m leasing out to a rancher on an annual contract for a competitive rate to recoup some of my costs. He does all the maintenance minus chemical cost for noxious weed control. If/when hyperinflation happens the price of beef will go up and I’ll adjust my lease rate accordingly to help hedge inflation.

Edit*

The state is also paying me to run some wild mustangs on it. Cross-grazing cattle with horses is mutually beneficial since they both mitigate parasites the other is susceptible to."
2021-05-10 17:19:37,wallstreetbets,"Valid question. No, not dumb ofc. If the play was right at the moment it was made, then hats off. It can always go both ways with calls though, either monumentally bad or exceptionally well. No in between, unfortunately."
2021-05-10 19:08:29,wallstreetbets,I bought calls and lost 11k. It was a stupid play.
2021-05-10 15:22:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but odds are still weighted in favor of the house."
2021-05-10 16:37:53,wallstreetbets,Apparently horse racing missed that memo.

2021-05-10 15:51:00,wallstreetbets,Does it matter how it's weighted if you're just going to make high-risk bets until you go broke?
2021-05-10 19:29:25,wallstreetbets,"No fucking shit. But to compare investing in growth stocks to buying actual lottery tickets like you did previously is a joke and doesn’t help anyone in any way. 

You’re literally just lumping all growth stocks in with bubble/fraud stocks, purely useless commentary."
2021-05-10 18:03:50,wallstreetbets,I've been trading for years now and I still don't mess with calls.. my ape brain can't handle that
2021-05-10 19:50:42,wallstreetbets,"I guess, but it seems hard to compare those two things :/"

2021-05-10 13:41:14,wallstreetbets,Been watching GME and it's just been so boring. Either crash so I can buy more or squeeze so I can buy a Lamborghini.  I can only handle so much edging!
2021-05-10 13:11:04,wallstreetbets,Looks like the more we buy the more it dips. Fuk the sistem. Hold GME forever.
2021-05-10 13:27:26,wallstreetbets,You’re pretty smart for a retard. I could only afford 5. I’ve been at xxx shares since Feb. the longer it takes the more I add 🤷🏾‍♂️🦍💎🙌🏾🚀🌙
2021-05-10 14:28:12,wallstreetbets,Real retard. I am really wondering where all these shares are coming from. There are so many people loading up that the average is either in high XX or XXX already. Are they freaking printing those shares?
2021-05-10 15:16:38,wallstreetbets,The only thing I’ve made from GME so far is 10 million new friends along the way. And you know what I’m not too upset about it
2021-05-10 13:49:59,wallstreetbets,yo guys watch me placing a yolo put order on gme so the price explodes again

2021-05-10 13:45:18,wallstreetbets,Wonderful stuff to see!
2021-05-10 14:33:38,wallstreetbets,"Wait so, If we buy and it dips. Does that mean if we sell it goes up? So if everyone sells 1 share each, will that make it go up 10,000,000?"

2021-05-10 14:37:35,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-05-10 14:40:40,wallstreetbets,It's going to be bumpy slow ride back down under $100. Since volatility has died down I'm having a hard time getting a decent return on my covered calls too. Might be time to gather my stuff in case I need to bail off this train in a hurry.
2021-05-10 13:44:42,wallstreetbets,How come it is dropping ?
2021-05-10 12:44:29,wallstreetbets,The question is why not?
2021-05-10 14:36:57,wallstreetbets,"This is the way, power to the players!"
2021-05-10 15:12:14,wallstreetbets,Isn’t it down 10% today
2021-05-10 15:55:02,wallstreetbets,"My thought here is even if somehow some government committee can find a way to stop the squeeze the stock's value really can ONLY go up. The company is reaching out to the community, removed all their debt, increasing their supply to branch into new areas, price matching, and breaking through the online sales bracket in a way that actually makes them more convenient than Amazon on a lot of orders! Especially since they do free shipping over certain prices, meaning it is even more attractive to people who don't have Amazon Prime!"
2021-05-10 16:11:21,wallstreetbets,"Everyone's still buying but the candle's shows us only Sell Orders🤡
I wait for the new 5usd drop und buy 15k shares."

2021-05-10 16:26:13,wallstreetbets,Don't wast your time with GME you will get burnt.
2021-05-10 14:39:38,wallstreetbets,"Lmao price dropping like my hope to live + tons of negative comments.

The guys here drawing spiderweb lines over 15 articles and ""connecting the dots"" and ""finding the clues"" as ""proof"" that *THE SQUEEEEZE* is coming and GME is going to 10,000 by June just sound like the QAnon people who are so fucking sure that The Storm is coming ~~in January~~ ~~in March~~ ~~in April~~ **soon** and all the satanic pedophiles who drink baby's blood will be arrested and Trump will be installed as dictator for life.

2021-05-10 18:41:52,wallstreetbets,Very likely since the squeeze already happened. No possibility of squeezing again since SI is below 20. There are lots of stocks. This is probably the dumbest one to put money into.
2021-05-10 17:54:03,wallstreetbets,This isn't the times of the Dutch East Indian trading company when u can trade only one stock. There are other plays in the world. But I'm glad you sold so u can hold more bags for us.

2021-05-10 16:00:56,wallstreetbets,I mean if you ask each of your 10 million friends to give you a dollar then you only need a fraction of them to say yes so you can do all that
2021-05-10 15:41:37,wallstreetbets,But I don’t understand you could buy GME instead of paying rent
2021-05-10 16:58:19,wallstreetbets,you might be in the wrong sub then lol
2021-05-10 18:27:55,wallstreetbets,if you could have each of your friend please send me $1 I will give you a crisp new $10 bill afterwards. You should then be happy because you will have $10
2021-05-10 19:55:51,wallstreetbets,But if you asked those 10 million if you could borrow a dollar and only 10% gave you one than you would be a millionaire. Am accepting offers lol r/millionairemakers

God damn I must be retarded to see that they are making good changes and may have value over forty fuckin bucks."
2021-05-10 18:03:24,wallstreetbets,Of course I have other plays going on but GME has gone cold. It’s not a bad thing to sell and rebuy at a lower price.

2021-05-10 18:06:43,wallstreetbets,"Market Makers are allowed to create naked shorts as part of REG SHO if they are engaged in ""bona fide market making"": https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm

> “Naked” short selling is not necessarily a violation of the federal securities laws or the Commission’s rules. Indeed, in certain circumstances, “naked” short selling contributes to market liquidity. **For example, broker-dealers that make a market in a security[4] generally stand ready to buy and sell the security on a regular and continuous basis at a publicly quoted price, even when there are no other buyers or sellers**. Thus, market makers must sell a security to a buyer even when there are temporary shortages of that security available in the market. **This may occur, for example, if there is a sudden surge in buying interest in that security, or if few investors are selling the security at that time**. Because it may take a market maker considerable time to purchase or arrange to borrow the security, a market maker engaged in bona fide market making, particularly in a fast-moving market, may need to sell the security short without having arranged to borrow shares. This is especially true for market makers in thinly traded, illiquid stocks as there may be few shares available to purchase or borrow at a given time.

Citadel, as a Market Maker, has the right to create as many shares as necessary via naked short selling *as long as they follow the rules with regards to locating actual shares before incurring a Fail to Deliver* (**FTD**).

As long as there are buyers, they have a right *and a responsibility* to create shares to aide liquidity in the market so long as they replace those naked shorts with real shares at defined windows in the future.

The problem now is that if Citadel actually locates those real shares to close their naked shorts created as part of their market making, **it will trigger the squeeze**.

As long as retail buys and holds, this only puts more pressure on the shorts as it piles more and more naked shorts on the Market Maker that eventually have to be closed-out with real shares.

As such, there are a number of different tactics now being used to mask the FTDs by using deep in the money options to kick the can down the road until the day of reckoning.

Not sure how all of this plays out, but my thesis is that this will cause Citadel to collapse and trigger a domino effect causing multiple DTC participants to fail.  There are a number of entities who are both DTC and OCC participants including Citadel, SIG, JP Morgan, etc.  So what I think is holding this up at the moment is [SR-OCC-2021-004](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/occ.htm) which re-shapes the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) member default procedures and it is this, I believe, that all parties are waiting for before the short squeeze will be ""allowed"" as it ensures an orderly wind-down of the defaulting members."
2021-05-10 17:19:30,wallstreetbets,Could market makers just be making more naked shorts?

Yeah sure, zjz pointing out that they're not compromised after you fuckers spend days harassing them about ""selling out"" is *totally* suspicious. Everybody knows if you're innocent you should just let the rumors fester and get out of control, right?

That is just stupid.

And do you have any evidence that GME content increased suddenly? Any evidence that it was being deleted before? Or do you just have your own feelings and confirmation bias just like the rest of the people who responded and tried to tell me otherwise, before ultimately either admitting they had nothing or trying to use links to rule-breaking posts as evidence?"

2021-05-10 18:21:58,wallstreetbets,"The problem in the case of GME and perhaps moreso with AMC now is that doing so will cause a buying spree due to FOMO and this will cascade into a gamma squeeze if the options chain allows which could then trigger margin calls of the shorts.

If you look at the OBV for GME (Google search site:reddit.com GME OBV) you will see that the GME OBV is building up to an absolute nuclear explosion when they start covering the shorts.

It's not even a Citadel problem at this point; it's a whole market, DTCC, and SEC problem.

This is the core thesis as to why GME is a once in a lifetime event that will **never** happen again; the SROs are now passing changes to their member charters to basically prevent this from happening ever again."

Our old pal Cramer also advertises for them. I think you’re comparing apples to oranges here.

The systemic risk is more apparent now as this is one of the largest attacks directly against SCADA systems. CyberSec professionals have been telling industries and municipalities their SCADA systems, if left even marginally at risk, WILL be ransomed and they WILL have to pay  This is not like SolarWinds where some software was stolen and millions of customers infected with backdoors. This is ransom that will have to be paid, lest millions are left without energy/power/food/treated water... etc.

Attacks like this will continue to rise in frequency and severity. Investment in Network Hardening and Security in general will continue to rise as Cyber Vulnerability increase (especially cloud vulnerability as companies begin having everyone telework... This attack specifically happened due to a telework vulnerability).

That being said, invest moderate term in FEYE/CRWD/NET, invest in BUG if your an ETF-boi (get off WSB while you're at it lol)."

- Business penetration will be slightly below estimates.
- Profitability will take another hit from exec stock compensation/sales…and possibly SPAC investments.

But, this isn’t enough to stop PLTR from grinding lower.

2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Undervalued Mortgage Company (UWC) UWMC has a lot of upside

&#x200B;

\- Trading at 0.74 P/B Ratio (I don't think any other stock currently being hyped on this subreddit has a P/B below 1)

\- Broker to Broker Business (No Advertising Cost) vs Broker to Consumer Business Model

\- 3B Net Income last Year (4.5% of all residential Mortgages in US) 

\- P/E of 5.66

\- Dividend of 5.75%

\- 0.00 Debt/Equity

This stock is fundamentally sound and earnings this afternoon should reflect that.  


UWMC has some downsides

&#x200B;

\- It do be a SPAC

\- It do be mortgage company being slammed right now (similar to RKT and LDI)

&#x200B;

I believe this stock is extremely undervalued. This stock hit it's ALL TIME LOW this morning. UWMC has insane fundamental value. I don't know if you'll be able to make a quick buck, but I think if you hold this company for at least one year you're taking $6.80 to 9.40 minimum, and a .40 dividend on top of that. That's a 44% return. Check the fundamentals for yourself. Not sure I would recommend options but I believe in the business model. 

&#x200B;

Not financial Advice. 1331 Shares deep @ 7.65 cost basis."
2021-05-10 12:02:02,wallstreetbets,"This one's a rough one for me. Initial 1k shares bought at $9.60 a month or two ago and it was the lowest that stock had been in weeks. Started tanking. Later in bought again at 7.75 to average down thinking it couldn't go lower. Bought again at $7.25 near it's all time low. Again last week bought at $7 and now it hit $6.60. Out of money to keep averaging down and praying it goes back up at some point. 1675 shares at $8.70 average. Plan to hold for the dividends if nothing else, expecting solid earnings today but the stock will still tank I'm sure."
2021-05-10 13:08:02,wallstreetbets,"Buy into the company that holds my mortgage?  Sure, why not."

2021-05-10 11:45:22,wallstreetbets,I have so many shares I think I can apply for a board seat. P/e is actually 3  and divided is 6.1% !! I’ve never heard of a stock deal like this.
2021-05-10 11:43:26,wallstreetbets,Just bought in. 🤞🏼
2021-05-10 11:23:40,wallstreetbets,Bias confirmed... could be epic today....
2021-05-10 18:57:24,wallstreetbets,"The company is now sitting on $1.592 billion in cash (up from $1.223 billion last quarter). They announced a $300 million share buyback AND pay a nearly 6% dividend. I LOVE this company right now, and every time it dips im buying more.

They did a stellar job of capitalizing on the refi mania and despite refi's starting to wane, theyre still CRANKING them out.

If you compare them to RKT which does about 4x the volume, they have a much lower average interest rate (3.00% weighted average interest rate which actually went DOWN this quarter despite overal rates rising, Very big incentive for brokers to go through them instead of RKT),  and average17 days to close when their competitors are closer to 50-60 (Another HUGE incentive for brokers to use them).

They are investing heavily in technology, which is reducing costs and further speeding up closing times, have a shitload of cash on hand, gaining wider margins (219 basis points now vs. 95 last year), and just hired a former executive of Fannie Mae to be their chief growth officer. The management team is KILLING it in my book, and although its a value stock, I'm betting they will see returns closer to growth companies. Their delinquency rates are 3-4 times lower than the competition as well.

We're entering a phase in the market where they have all the advantages, rising rates, quickly rising home values and hot market in general necessitating quick turnaround, and in fact are GUIDING HIGHER on originations for next quarter despite competitors like RKT warning that there will be a huge pullback next quarter, although their margin will likely shrink back down to more realistic levels.

Bottom line, they performed perfectly during the windfall that was handed to them, wrung every red cent they could out of the opportunity, and are using the funds to grow like crazy. They just plain have a better product than RKT and we will see them to continue to absorb market share. You're not going to pry these shares out of my hands for anywhere below $25

I'd buy a ton of warrants except i want that sweet ass dividend so its shares for me.

Edit: another important point is they are building up an astronomical amount of cash with not a lot of things they can do with it aside from share buybacks, special dividends, and dividend increases. Aside from actual growth I’m banking on the company rewarding me handsomely through dividend payouts and float reduction."
2021-05-10 12:13:04,wallstreetbets,I'm going full retard. Have 11k shares and just bought 5k more shares on margin.. cost basis around $7. Originally was assigned off 7.50 puts I sold.

I think the earnings will be good, but even if it drops more from people selling the news (which may or may not happen since it’s already suffered due to RKT’s results and people expecting something similar) this is just a bargain imo."

2021-05-10 12:18:28,wallstreetbets,">k had been in weeks. Started tanking. Later in bought again at 7.75 to average down thinking it couldn't go lower. Bought again at $7.25 near it's all time low. Again last week bought at $7 and now it hit $6.60. Out of money to keep averaging down and praying it goes back up at some point. 1675 shares at $8.70 average. Plan to hold for the dividends if nothing else, expecting solid earnings today but the stock will still tank I'm sure.

I've been averaging down since I initially bought in at 8.75, but I like the business model, solid finances, I haven't seen anything to even justify the drop in the stock these last few weeks other than it's a SPAC and for some reason wall street murdered RKT over missing earnings by .01.

UWMC had started climbing and then dropped massively in response to RKT. We don’t know what’s built in.

You can lock up every block of 100 shares into writing a covered call contract that you then sell to someone who is buying a call.  You are just selling them the guaranteed price between now and a set expiration date with a strike price that is above where you think it will actually hit.  When someone buys the contract, you get the premium right away and just can't sell those shares until the expiration unless you want to take on the risk in the event that the contract expires in the money.  Some brokers will prevent you from selling them if your account is only approved for writing covered calls and not writing uncovered calls, but I wouldn't personally sell them anyway.  If the price doesn't hit the strike price, then you walk away with the premium and can just write another contract after the expiration date.  If it does, the call owner will likely execute it, paying you the agreed price per share that you get on top of the premium previously paid.  If that is already a solid return, then you still make a good profit on the position.  If at some point in the future you think there is going to be a catalyst that sends it to the moon, then you don't write a new contract at that point."

2021-05-10 15:51:45,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's my thought process as well.  It isn't about each call you write bringing in serious bank, it's about giving you an additional return on top of the \~5% dividend return.  If it ends up printing, you still got all the previous dividends, plus all previous calls you sold, on top of the profits from it printing at that unlikely price point.  The only risk is that if it rockets for some unforeseen reason way past the $10 strike price you miss out on those extra gains.  But constant repeatable gains are better than a very low chance of serious gains when dealing with UWMC IMO.

$10 per contract at cost basis of 6.80/share, assuming about a 45 day cycle on the contracts, yields almost an extra 12% annual return."
2021-05-10 12:35:44,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, I do remember hearing that. The price of increased competitiveness in the mortgage marketplace. It'll be interesting to hear what happens on UWMC's call tomorrow AM. Really idk how different the margins are on wholesale b2b vs b2c. I imagine in a b2c you have to invest quite a bit to get the customer in the door, but RKT is taking an ""Amazon"" approach where they have all services in house. You have to pay a little upfront in order to get those customers but if their model works out long term you're more than making up for it by keeping everything in house. Seems like a sound strategic approach to own the market. I prefer the b2b model because imo it seems for beneficial to the broker and consumer vs. the company alone.  RKT is definitely playing the long game with their business model though, could shift the market in a few years if they succeed."

Why? Because they don’t lend to them

2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What are the “equity offerings” Pitney Bowes mentions in its recent filing with the SEC? On March 24, Pitney filed a Form 8-K regarding the sale of $400M and $350M of senior unsecured notes:  
[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000078814/000114036121009686/brhc10022098\_8k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000078814/000114036121009686/brhc10022098_8k.htm)

There is a reference to “equity offerings” as follows in the filing above:  
""In addition, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of either series at any time prior to March 15, 2024 in an amount not to exceed the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price of...""

Furthermore, “Equity Offering” is defined in Section 1.01 of the related exhibit below as ""a primary public or private offering after the Issue Date of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Equity Interests) of the Issuer, other than (a) a public offering registered on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or (b) an issuance to any Subsidiary of the Issuer.""  
[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000078814/000114036121009686/brhc10022098\_ex4-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000078814/000114036121009686/brhc10022098_ex4-1.htm)

To check if this ""Equity Claw"" provision was used in previous note issues, I searched Pitney's 8-K filings during the past 7 years for similar transactions. I found four but none of them have any mention of “equity offerings” in the main body of the filing:

09/15/17: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000078814/000156761917001982/s001864x5\_8k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000078814/000156761917001982/s001864x5_8k.htm)

There must be a reason why the lawyers chose to add this provision in the new financing agreements.

So, what is Pitney Bowes planning to do to potentially pay off some of its debt?  
1. Sell more baby bonds to replace its 6.70% Notes Due 2043 (PBI.PRB) to take advantage of the low interest rate environment.  
2. Spin-off/Carve-out its growing Global Ecommerce business through an IPO.  
3. Issue more of its own common stock."

I understand that people implement cost averaging to increase their position on long/dividend investments. I have over the last 2 months been implementing this to gradually average my cost/% of loss on my bad positions. I'm not even trying to gain when I exit my position. I'm trying to break even or reduce my loss. 
Today TDAmeritrade's block desk messaged me saying this activity has been flagged as possibly Manipulative. The worst penalty listed is having my account closed by them.

The position I am trading has a very low volume traded. I limit buy the same amount everyday at the Ask price to ensure it fills since I'm only trying to Average my cost down and not get a cheap deal.

Would it be worth it to explain to TDA's Block Desk what I'm trying to do with my cost averaging exit strategy or should I just exit at a loss?"
2021-05-10 10:49:25,wallstreetbets,"Wait, you’re continuing to buy dog stocks just so your averages look better for those shitty stocks?

2021-05-10 11:45:46,wallstreetbets,"Just email them back and tell them your averaging down.  

I'm not sure how this is manipulation.  I feel like there must be something more to the story...

Is the price going up everyday and so everyday you're buying more at a higher price, which is slowly walking the price up?  Are you selling some of those everyday as well?

Computers are adaptive if they know every day someone's going to buy 500 shares at ask.  This should respond by offering those at a higher price each morning."
2021-05-10 11:23:02,wallstreetbets,"Investors average down on stocks they believe are worth holding because they believe they will appreciate in value.

Your logic doesn't make sense.

I'm trying to average my loss down, so I don't care if it's cheap, so let me voluntarily pay more then the market price.

That's like going on Craigslist and offering people more then the listed price."
2021-05-10 12:15:50,wallstreetbets,"If you want to make money back and break even, sell covered calls!!! Make sure you sell them at your break even price and you will very soon bring down your cost basis or get assigned at break even."

2021-05-10 15:22:21,wallstreetbets,"math doesn't work like that.

i can see why your activity might look like price manipulation if you are a large chunk of the volume coming in and hitting the ask every single day too."
2021-05-10 16:15:28,wallstreetbets,"I can see your problem

2021-05-10 13:48:32,wallstreetbets,You need to tell them. Just exiting isn't a solution.
2021-05-10 11:20:35,wallstreetbets,I would roll over my account into Robinhood and close the one I had with TDA. Nobody will know your name over there.
2021-05-10 10:21:47,wallstreetbets,"Do you have other bids jump at you when you try to buy more? 

Here's why I'm asking 

Because I've seen before when there is a option between. 25 and .35 and I placed a bid at .30 and suddenly all the .25 bids moved up to .30 

So technically I would've been able to manipulate the price up if I wanted to sell 

So maybe think if your actions somehow has anything in common with this 

Just putting a scenario out there . 

Or there is this thing called spoofing (Google it)when you place a big bid to scare away the ask or to convince people to buy higher because a whale is coming in or to have your orders thats sitting at the ask to be filled without you actually wanting to get your bid order filled"
2021-05-10 15:26:53,wallstreetbets,"Ditch td Ameritrade. I was out of service due to traveling for work and they sold 2 of my shares. More so completely erased them.

I counted all my buys and they added up to 22, then the page refreshed and it only shows 20. I’m switching to fidelity tomorrow. I’d avoid td Ameritrade if I were you"
2021-05-10 10:50:34,wallstreetbets,But that bid... It'll fill faster and you'll still be just as sad

2021-05-10 11:55:27,wallstreetbets,Yeah I just explained that I was trying to average down. Price has basically stayed the same. People selling haven't even taken advantage by increasing their price point.
2021-05-10 11:57:07,wallstreetbets,this info gets said so much and I don't believe it's correct. you can only write off losses if you are net negative for the year from what I've learned.

2021-05-10 11:31:16,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the help. I bought more bad stocks than good stocks last year when I knew nothing. I understand what I'm doing better now. I have bought and increased my positions on my winners this year.
2021-05-10 10:31:57,wallstreetbets,If they already think I'm manipulating this stock posting an image here is only going to legitimize their claims. I could post all of my positions here but I can't divulge this specific one.

2021-05-10 18:36:14,wallstreetbets,"If it's a dog, why continue buying it? Buying to reduce an average doesn't make you money, you make money from the stock going up"
2021-05-10 12:22:00,wallstreetbets,"I suspect you got flagged by one of their bots because it sounds like you were doing something mostly repetitive every day and were sent a standardized letter. I'd just call and talk to them about it. Shouldn't be a big deal, but might as well resolve it."
2021-05-10 14:26:11,wallstreetbets,Honestly I would call them and tell them what you said in this post. They flag a number of accounts for this stuff and the majority are the ppl like you who may have a silly strategy but aren't manipulative in and of themselves. They just have to flag these to make sure you actually have a reason for doing what you are doing.
2021-05-10 14:43:51,wallstreetbets,"No, you can write off losses up to the amount of gains and carry over $3000 to next year.  The $3k May have changed but premise is the same"
2021-05-10 12:40:17,wallstreetbets,"Read the second half of that sentence. What /u/Heavenbound77 is saying is if you take a $10k loss on a specific stock sale because you've lost faith in it, sell another stock that you have conviction in that's up $10k and immediately rebuy the gain. Now you can offset your losses with gains so you have a non-taxable event at the end of the year."

2021-05-10 12:39:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I agree, sounds like an automated letter.... They have probably gotten  little bit of heat to crack down on mmanipulation in recent days,So I wouldn't be surprised if they just sent a bunch of these letters out to people as a warning."
2021-05-10 15:27:50,wallstreetbets,If you immediately re-buy it becomes a wash sale and won't offset any losses.  You wouldn't be able to re-buy for more than 30 days if you want to do this.
2021-05-10 13:03:28,wallstreetbets,"You can deduct up to 3000 of net loss, but it has to be net. If you sell a 10k loss  but also sell a 20k win in the same year you owe 10k worth of short term capital gains taxes"
2021-05-10 19:44:10,wallstreetbets,Excellent contribution to a conversation.
2021-05-10 11:41:14,wallstreetbets,I already got rid of Nokia. This is a different stock I am doing this with.
2021-05-10 15:58:32,wallstreetbets,"Not if you're up on the second stock.

Here's the example:
- You bought 100x NIO at $60, stock tanked to $40. You lose faith in the company so you sell. You now have a $2000 loss.

- You bought 100x NET at $45 and its now at $65. You still believe in teh company and you're up $2000.

If you sell your NIO and NET at the same time, the gain offsets the loss. You can then buy NET immediately afterwards at $65 and not have that considered a wash sale because you never had a loss on NET.

You get to hold NET, a long term hold without a tax event on the first $2000 gain. You lose NIO which is a non-conviction hold, and now you're just even. 

You get to claim up to $3000 on taxes, so this strategy works as long as your gains/losses exceed $3000. If its more than $3000, you can roll forward your losses to next year, but the maximum loss you can claim on each year of taxes is $3000.

Maybe I'm wrong, and I'm open to correction.

But when someone says ""tax loss harvesting"", this is the general strategy."
2021-05-10 16:11:42,wallstreetbets,"Wash sale only applicable on losses. If he’s buying back the stock that he just sold for a gain and not touching the stock he took a loss on, then all is well."
2021-05-10 13:41:54,wallstreetbets,"No? In that scenario, you'd have no capital gains owed in that year and 9,977,000 of losses to carry forward to next year."
2021-05-10 13:20:53,wallstreetbets,"It's good to keep your stock picks secret. If other people heard about them, they might buy and drive the price up. That will obliterate the ""perpetually average down"" strategy."

They short the living shit out of PLTR on PURPOSE. If they can short and rebuy, they make money. If they get you to sell, they make money.

2021-05-10 11:13:20,wallstreetbets,This guy stonks.
2021-05-10 13:16:29,wallstreetbets,"Using us like a tool.  Well hey, so can I.  I emailed them and gave them the numbers they need to figure out my losses.  If I can't get compensation, then I can settle for seeing the stock get delisted into worthless pink pieces of paper.  I would love to see bears try to short a OTC stock without getting burned to a crisp by fees and borrowing interest."

2021-05-10 12:58:46,wallstreetbets,"I'm not even holding RKT but this post and OPs post are pure nonsense. This is all FUD. Stone lawyers are ""investigating"" like they do on nearly every stock in order to make a name for themselves. This investigation is completely meaningless."

2021-05-10 10:18:11,wallstreetbets,"Been selling CSP's since January. Mostly monthlies, but occasionally weeklies. I think the party is ending though because IV is gone so this probably isn't going to work as well going forward."

2021-05-10 12:38:02,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t count. You lost $34 on one of them. Give the money back to us and start over.

2021-05-10 17:57:36,wallstreetbets,This could have gone horribly wrong.
2021-05-10 15:46:47,wallstreetbets,"So you're selling put and call options, knowing monkeys are still buying stupid OTM calls, and making them pay through theta decay?"
2021-05-10 11:09:59,wallstreetbets,"Damn, that's some juicy premium. The fact that GME is still holding up must suck for option holders on both sides. Pays to be a seller of Far OTM's. Looks like returns are falling off though like you said. Probably not worth the risk since GME looks to be declining with the market and fundamentals don't offer enough incentive at current valuation. The IV is only giving a few hundred per contract, and that's weeks out. R / R not good."
2021-05-10 10:16:22,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-05-10 12:22:53,wallstreetbets,theta gang wins again...
2021-05-10 11:22:01,wallstreetbets,Why do some of the Puts have “w” on the end?

2021-05-10 16:56:59,wallstreetbets,I sold covered calls and put those into SPY weeklies but actually bought some GME on this dip
2021-05-10 11:32:22,wallstreetbets,THIS IS THE WAY
2021-05-10 12:35:50,wallstreetbets,Could it transpire that certain MM are making money to pay off short interest by also selling covered calls? Or is that too stupid to even consider?

2021-05-10 18:01:29,wallstreetbets,I've been doing basically the same thing with about the same return in the same amt of time. This week I'm delving more into amc since it has more momentum and better returns.

Edit:  why did this get downvoted?  Trying to understand what the column “total cost” entails?  Obv some commissions on some sales, but other sales its significant.  Is that buying to close?  Spreadsheet is different from most layouts i’ve seen."

2021-05-10 16:02:18,wallstreetbets,It has been glorious.  I too am sad its down to 100% IV.  Not selling so many any more.
2021-05-10 17:18:30,wallstreetbets,IV is still above 100%. Are you going to keep doing this moving forward?

2021-05-10 15:31:05,wallstreetbets,"They would have to own stock to sell covered calls. 

If they owned stock they wouldnt be short. 

Naked calls? Maybe. If they are truest manipulating the price of the stock they could sell naked calls until they plan to cover their shorts. Then switch to selling naked puts and start covering the shorts. 

This would mitigate some of what they are losing.  But if they were not able to manipulate the stock price it would be extremely risky."

2021-05-10 13:17:58,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't cost anything. But each of those $16 puts is a $1600 liability, technically."
2021-05-10 15:34:42,wallstreetbets,"Did you mean price?

He sells them for whatever the market will bear for them. It is an open auction like everything else. The risk he is taking is that he must buy 100 shares of the stock @ $16 because he SOLD the put. The holder that BOUGHT the put is exchanging money for the right to SELL shares @ $16 if the stock price is below $16 at the expiration of the put (in this example) The seller is accepting money for the risk of being assigned the shares. Not terribly risky with GME @ $145"
2021-05-10 17:31:11,wallstreetbets,"He ends up with the shares and premium if they close below the strike price. If the price of the shares + premium equal more than we he paid for the shares he is ahead. He could sell calls with those 100 shares now or simply sell them and start over again. The strat is call the wheel, it can be a very slow way to generate money with a huge risk of the stock tanks in a short period of time. It is like running in front of a steamroller yo pick up a penny in a lot of cases."
2021-05-10 15:03:46,wallstreetbets,"It looks like he closed it at a slight loss, before expiration."
2021-05-10 13:19:08,wallstreetbets,Give it a gamma squeeze will ya?

2021-05-10 18:59:20,wallstreetbets,"Yup, although they are not called covered puts. The nomenclature is cash secured puts (or CSP).

OP sold insurance policies to people that were worried about GME dropping below a certain (strike) price. They never did so the policies expired worthless and he collected the premiums.

Also as an FYI, CC = Covered calls."
2021-05-10 13:13:46,wallstreetbets,"He didn't buy puts, he sold them"

Got it...."
2021-05-10 12:49:09,wallstreetbets,OP has been writing puts. the only call wrote was a covered call. If anything he/she's more bullish than you are with your one share of GME. OP's literally writing checks that his/her ass to cash.

His broker holds 8k (Your portfolio value will stay the same but you'll notice you just lost 8k purchasing power) and OP immediately collects the premium like in CCs from the option purchaser.

Puts get exercised similarly to how calls would get exercised. Calls are a bet the price will go up. Puts are a bet the price will go down."

2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Nokia: A Detailed Review of the Company I have been bullish on Nokia for a long time. I am betting on Pekka Lundmark and his blueprint to success on Nokia's comeback from the early 5G fiasco. 

It hasn't been a year since his appointment as Nokia's CEO however he has already made very bald moves. He changed the high level leaders within the organization. He changed the approach to 5G, going from an end to end strategy to customer specific approach. Basically, saying if we are not making money on any segment of our business, we won't sign unprofitable contracts just to support the ""greater good"". His goal is to be the technology leader where-ever Nokia is competing. He has no intention of being the low cost provider as his goal is consistent high profitability via technological leadership. That is the right approach. Therefore, he is increasing the R&D spending significantly. More on that later.

He also trimmed the Nokia leadership team from 17 leaders to 11. Maybe the most important move he has made was giving not only full accountability to division leaders, meaning they did not have to consult 10 plus people when they wanted to make a decision regarding their divisions, he also gave them full responsibility. Now, division leaders have the full power AND the full responsibility. The reason why this is very critical is very simple. With this approach, he eliminated internal wars regarding profitability and accountability. Some division leaders-rightfully or wrongfully- hid under the excuse of signing contracts for the ""greater good"" of the company. Plus, Nokia's group common and other ""division"" which is the corporate support division of Nokia had way too many people. The reason for this for me is simple. Some divisions were offloading expenses to look profitable. It made no difference to the company as a whole, it just made them and their bonuses much better. Now, Pekka moved over 10k employees from Group Common out to the divisions they really belong to. 

So, the blueprint is there. What about the execution? Since Pekka Lundmark has been at Nokia, Nokia performed really well in the earnings reports. His guidance has been on the conservative side. He promised the investors and share holders full transparency and he held that promise... Sometimes to the point of annoying the share holders as the stock plummeted after a great earnings report last year when he said the famous words, ""next year will be challenging"". If he perhaps chose better wording, Nokia would have went up 15% instead of plummeting. I feel that the newest hire in Nokia, Melissa Schoeb who is the Chief Corporate Affairs Officer will help with some of this and since her hiring whether related or not, Q1 earnings call had a much different vibe to it than the previous calls. Pekka Lundmark looked a lot more positive than before and I don't think it was only due to the great results. Anyways...

Let's take a look at the first quarter of the challenging  year:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5zdagi6t4ay61.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=f84e604efa4435bcdf9d5ff06a0532670269a321

EPS expectations were 0.01 Euros per share btw. Basically, Nokia killed it with a caveat. Regional and product mixes were favorable as well as the SG&A and R&D spendings were lower than expected. These will balance out in the upcoming quarters and therefore seasonality will not be as high as previous years. The exact effect is unknown however the Q1 earnings are so good that I don't see a way where full year results will be within the lower or even mid range of the guidance. I believe Nokia will beat even it's high end guidance easily. Moreover, I believe the OM improvement for MN to 5-8% will happen in 2022 instead of 2023. There is just no way for this year to be negative and next year to be stagnant if you look at the numbers and listen to each division leader during conference calls or more importantly during the last capital markets day presentation.

Let's take a look at the guidance:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fx1bau9x5ay61.png?width=345&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d8ad5e3b6593f19a02dd541d3299845b9b9603b

In Q1 2021:

Mobile Networks had 3.4% OM

Network Infrastructure had 10.8% OM

Cloud and Network Services had -3% OM (this was due to unprofitable contracts signed in the past but these will balance out in upcoming quarters and per the team Nokia will reach it's guidance for 2021)

Nokia technologies had 78.4% OM. 

Basically, in its historically weakest quarter, Nokia had extremely good results. 

Post Q1 Earnings:

I expect Network Infrastructure to go full steam ahead as Nokia signed strong contracts in the US. There is no indication or a reason for it to slow down. 

[https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/tmobile-expands-home-internet-to-more-than-130-additional-cities-towns](https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/tmobile-expands-home-internet-to-more-than-130-additional-cities-towns)

Also, Nokia's full year 2021 revenue estimate is between 20.6 billion Euros to 21.8 billion Euros.

That was with the estimation of Networks Infrastructure having around 7 billion Euros in revenues. However, NI is doing excellently and it was the highlight of the Q1 earnings report. Not only because NI is on a trajectory to earn 2 billion Euros more than expected in full year 2021 but because NI has 9%-10% OMs. Therefore, the additional revenue/profit will hit the EPS stronger than say the CaNS division.

Here is how well the NI is doing: (You can also see the strong seasonality in Mobile Networks division in the chart below)

&#x200B;

Here you can see the favorable regional mix. North America and Europe has better margins than anywhere else:

Enterprise Market:

This one is extremely important. Per Pekka Lundmark Nokia is a leader in the Enterprise market. This is very important not because it is a new-ish market and a additional revenue opportunity but because the growth and the profitability is very high. This market is expected to grow in double digits in the next 5 or so years.

Currently, Enterprise market is somewhat small with around the size of 10% of the CSP market, however that will change within 3-5 years. By, 2025 Enterprise market will at absolute minimum be around 3.5 billion Euros with double digit operating margins. If that happens, and the whole industry is saying it is already happening, Nokia's share price will get to $20 much earlier than expected.

&#x200B;

Ericsson comparison:

Ericsson's share price is $13.90 with a market cap of about $46 billion

Nokia's share price is $5.10 with a market cap of about $29 billion

Does that make sense to anyone? If you think now Nokia is managed properly, how can you value these two companies in this laughable manner? 

However, for the value investors, this is where the value of Nokia lies. It is heavily undervalued and is trading like bankruptcy is an option where as this company has solid cash reserves at over 3 billion Euros and positive cash flows going forwards with no chance of bankruptcy whatsoever.

Let's talk about potential:

Ericsson has 138 Commercial 5G agreements, 81 5G contracts and 85 live 5G networks

[https://www.ericsson.com/en/5g/contracts](https://www.ericsson.com/en/5g/contracts)

Nokia has 220+ Commercial 5G agreements, 165 Commercial 5G deals and 65 live 5G networks

[https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/](https://www.nokia.com/networks/5g/5g-contracts/)

For those that claim Nokia is winning all these contracts that are unprofitable or Nokia is cost cutting Ericsson to win contracts, you are wrong: please watch the CMD presentation and pay attention to Tommi Uitto's section. Spoiler, Nokia is not offering low margins to win contracts. They haven't needed to cut costs to CSPs to win contracts. Therefore, the potential is absolutely there. 

I was somewhat taken back by the CMD presentation when Nokia skipped 2022 guidance and instead gave 2023 guidance. I suspected things would get worse before they got better. However, looking at the Q1 earnings report, so many things are going well for Nokia that I don't see how things will take a turn for the worse.

Sure, the usual seasonality will not happen at the degree it usually does but that doesn't mean Networks Infrastructure will slow down and Mobile Networks will plummet to negative margins. R&D and SG&A expenses will go up, per Marc Wiren, Nokia will accumulate some inventory in the upcoming quarters that they skipped on in Q1 and these things will smooth the curve however they will not cause Nokia to deviate from it's guidance. 

Therefore, I am much more bullish than ever before. Especially, hearing how well Nokia is managed in avoiding the chip shortage. 

Nokia currently should be around $6-7 range. Conservatively, I expect within 1 year Nokia to reach $9-12. Within 2-4 years $20 or more is possible due to strong foothold in the highly profitably and high growth Enterprise market and the strong performance in the US and Europe markets partly thanks to the Huawei situation."

Nokia is 90% of my portfolio right now. I had 60% of my portfolio in Apple pre-covid  but when Covid hit, I thought ""luxury electronics"" market would take a big hit with large unemployment numbers so I sold it (unfortunately :) ).

Other 5%, I have in AT&T purely for the dividend and that the stock likes to trade between $30-40 and I bought at $31 and will sell if it gets to high $30s. T-Mobile or Verizon  are possibly better plays but I feel comfortable with AT&T and have a good idea about its floor & ceiling. It's not a growth stock but it's a good dividend stock. It has a lot of debt but it's income is good enough to cover the dividend. So, why not?

2021-05-10 14:04:54,wallstreetbets,"I did briefly but to extend on that comparison Nokia and Ericsson has similar revenues. 

I have to talk about why Ericsson is where it is now before I can claim why Nokia should be within the same ballpark:

Ericsson has been managed well in the 5G era with their new-ish CEO. They really turned the corner so to speak. They have better margins as of now. They have been gaining market share whereas Nokia has been losing some. They have strong foothold in China and Nokia is almost kicked out of it. 

Having said that, Pekka Lundmark mentioned on the CMD that Nokia in many aspects caught up with the competition since his appointment and at the end of 2021, Nokia being behind it's rivals ie Ericsson in the 5G war will be history.

Bottom line is, Nokia has not been managed well under the previous over-promising and under-delivering CEO. Now, Pekka Lundmark is doing great.

(I had to mention why they are not on the same level to show why they should be)  

I mentioned the past, lets mention the present: Things have changed in the last few months. Now Nokia is profitable with strong cash position, positive free cash flow guidance and a very strong balance sheet.  

Plus, as mentioned in my post, Nokia has much more upside potential with substantially higher signed 5G agreements in comparison to Ericsson.

Additionally, Nokia is a leader in the Enterprise market. I mentioned that this market will grow in double digits and is much more profitable than the CSP market. Within a short period of time it will double from about 1.7 billion Euros per year to 3.5 million Euros per year. With double digits OMs, this will propel Nokia's share price to mid to upper $10 range IMO.

When two companies within the same industry have similar revenues and the one with a bigger potential has much lower market cap, I see value. If Nokia was managed properly in the beginning of the 5G era and chose the correct chipset, Nokia would be around $8-9 range right now. There wouldn't be as much value in investing in this stock. It was not and therefore the stock is traded at a discount. That's why I am in Nokia.

If this doesn't answer your question, search my post history and look at my previous Nokia threads.  
Good luck"
2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Plays Against Inflation It seems many are trying to bail on stocks because inflation. (collectibles that we treat as currency, commodities etc). I wanted to explore is if there are certain categories of stocks that are better positioned against Inflation.

So I came up with a short-list of they type of stocks I might look for in a period with volatile inflation.

1. Established Brand Name. This gives the company pricing power because clients are going to buy their product because of what they are getting is also associated with the brand and not just the product. Think AAPL, MCD, KO.
2. Commodity selling stocks, industrial sector ([https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/RGI/#holdings)). Think metal mines, lumber, companies that produce commodity byproducts that are used in industry (no discrete product firms, like jewelry makers).
3. Capitalist Europe. If it goes down in the USA, it all goes down - true, but there is a place where it will go down less relative to others. So, I'm looking at European companies that do not have diversity and inclusion in their 10K. These are actually young companies that are thirsty to grow and will do anything and everything to move up. Alternatively, I look at cultures who are still capitalist, think Russia, Poland, Ireland, Estonia.
4. Companies with more fixed-rate debt instead of floating rate debt. If the interest is fixed but there is more money in circulation the lenders are in trouble not the borrowers.
5. Government-backed stocks. Especially those that have defense contracts. I think that bad times create civil unrest with a potential for internal and external escalation. Think Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed Martin ([https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings](https://etfdb.com/etf/DFEN/#holdings)) 

What would you do if you were worried about inflation eating your gains?"

Oil isn’t going anywhere..talks of green energy and divestment needs to be paid for by having higher oil prices. Everything we do revolves around that black carbon rich penguin and shorebird covered sticky liquid. 

US is in no rush to invest in more drilling operations. So the limited supply is gonna get more pricey.

2021-05-10 18:45:12,wallstreetbets,"correct

stocks dont shit because of inflation, they shit because either the fed raises rates to curb inflation or people think they will raise rates

however, if you really think inflation is going to rip, stocks are the absolute best place to go along for the ride and preserve your wealth

real estate will also react similarly

you may take a hit in the short term as interest rates go up, but it will be short and small compared to the rip in stock and real estate prices if real inflation is here to stay"
2021-05-10 11:34:38,wallstreetbets,"True. Hence the first point on the shortlist. Companies with pricing power can adjust, others are less flexible."

A year later however the year over year comps are looking very good. Like very good. The sell side is starting to upgrade these companies as their positions are getting filled. XOM COP. These large caps are getting the love. Not just oil though, refineries as well. the gasoline crack spread hasn't looked this good since 2017. (Which was peak business cycle post 2008) 

With that, the next trade are the juniors to trade higher as their revenue balloons. Cad oil like CNQ and SU are showing awesome cash flow. Which shows the upside in mid cap. 

The last class to follow is services and small cap. VET is a great small cap that just smashed the street on its last earnings. Consider adding leaps here and give yourself time. VET is currently at ~8$ but in 2017 it was ~40$+. Now there was a bad purchase since then, but even with that asset the company looks strong."

2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is $PLTR really that good of a buy? All I’ve heard for the passed year is how amazing $Pltr is and how great of an investment it is.

I bought in at $20, sold calls for a bit, and eventually got exercised at $40. FOMO hit and I bought back in at $38, and have been sitting tight for a while, unable to sell calls.

I’m thinking about buying in again right now, but I’m seriously wondering...is it really that good? What makes it such a good buy other than the fact that data is the future? What are we waiting for at this point as far as fundamentals go with $PLTR?"
2021-05-10 08:35:26,wallstreetbets,I hope so. I’m also nah holding 1000 shares at 38

Earnings will likely be luke warm. Stock will probably plummet, and the day will be topped with a meaty Karp sell-off, as per usual.

&#x200B;

If, for some reason, it DOES rise on earnings, the before-mentioned Karp sell-off will quickly take it deep red.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Personally, this company is great for a 10+ year don't-look hold. But short term, I wish I never had gotten in, and if my losses were not so painful, I would take the L and put my money into something with much better short-term potential.

2021-05-10 16:35:23,wallstreetbets,"I work in the software engineering space, can confirm that the work PLTR’s engineers are doing will change the world of business. A lot of companies are trying to release competing SaaS that will optimize performance. In my humble opinion, I believe that the competitors are not on the same level due to their inadequate hiring. PLTR’s talent level, speaking to software engineers, is astounding. Top 10 tech company to try and pull software engineers from. Aside from the sort of “key-man risk”, I like this stock."
2021-05-10 08:34:07,wallstreetbets,"I’m holding for long term, by long term I mean at least 5 years. You still see a lot of good news for PLTR, meaning there’s still more room for the price to go down, we will only the see the bottom when there’extreme negative sentiment about the stock, now there isn’t yet."
2021-05-10 13:10:34,wallstreetbets,"Everything originally on here about PLTR was hold for 3-5 years.  Then more people joined and thought PLTR was some quick investment when all the original DD said this is a long term play.  Nothing has changed, other than a bunch of idiots who have no clue what they are doing thought this was something it is not."
2021-05-10 12:40:31,wallstreetbets,"Here's my take and it's got a couple of angles.

The first thing is, in my life, I saw a variety of investment opportunities that kind of *spoke* to me. I saw the Iphone and said 'Oh, that's going to change everything.' I saw Netflix and thought the same. I saw a CEO change from one company to another and thought 'Man.. that's gonna be massive.' and I didn't act on any of them because at the time, I asked other people more '*in the know*' than I was and they talked me out of it and their reasons weren't bad.

All of those opportunities could've made me a lot of money but I missed them. None of them were overnight. They all took years to get to their peaks.

PLTR is one of those for me. When I saw it, saw what they do and have done I said 'Oh, yeah, I get it.. this is going to be huge.'.

I just think that any company that can assist multi billion dollar operations in making more billions is itself going to make billions (billy yansen) of dollars. It's really that simple for me.

So, that's it for me. I'm way long on them. 10 years or a trillion dollar market cap. See where that gets me."
2021-05-10 08:58:37,wallstreetbets,"PLTR has a moat in terms of what they have built, based on R&D costs. Lots of money and time over the past 10 years. Assuming a company wants to build something similar, it's going to take probably $30-50M in R&D and 2-3 years. That's a pretty big risk.

Even if PLTR wasn't providing a lot of value to customers, they are addressing the setup and knowledge gaps that exist in building inference systems in companies. The fact they provide value as well is just icing on the cake.

Wall street will come around eventually, but the rotation out of tech due to inflation has hurt. It could continue to drop to 18, but unless their earnings are terrible, it doesn't seem like it would go much lower."
2021-05-10 10:02:23,wallstreetbets,"GUH, I've watched pltr be side bound between 21-23 & I thought 19.50 was a steal."
2021-05-10 08:50:11,wallstreetbets,"I was in at $9 and out at $11, and yes I wanted to kill myself watching it go up like it did.

 IMO I am comfortable that PLTR should be at around $16 as a new entry point."
2021-05-10 10:03:31,wallstreetbets,PLTR is still one of my biggest positions. This significant pull back is a huge opportunity.

The problem with the company is that their market cap is $32.5B and they only had $1.1B  in revenues in 2020. That's already a massive valuation counting on future growth. Just as an example, BE, which is another bag I am holding, released Financials today and their market cap is less than 3x revenues."
2021-05-10 14:44:13,wallstreetbets,ARK invest is a heavy believer of $PLTR.  They usually invest for the long run and are willing to wait to see explosive growth from great execution over a longer period of time.  I'm thinking in terms of 5 year horizon for this stock.

PLTR's moat is simplifying the whole process so you don't need a data science team. It's essentially inference as a service, while Alteryx is an inference toolkit your data science team can use.

2021-05-10 09:07:21,wallstreetbets,Ok 🔮
2021-05-10 17:48:52,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the response. I’ve always valued your opinion. You have lead me to the water twice with GME.
2021-05-10 10:51:07,wallstreetbets,"You have no idea how the software works do you? The software basically helps you identify probable outcomes to different scenarios in a business. 
Basically a digital version of a consulting company with the capacity to access all the data stored by the company in a very short amount of time to make a decision. 

But! Consulting companies aren’t valued too highly in terms of stocks. Hence, it’s marketed as a tech stock- As we all know, for tech stocks to have a PE over 1000+ is totally acceptable and justified as “They’ll make much more money in the future , they have tech we can’t understand yet, …”"
2021-05-10 10:51:33,wallstreetbets,What does the software do?
2021-05-10 14:43:12,wallstreetbets,"Covered Calls are easy. You set a strike price for the number of calls you can sell (1 call is equivalent to 100 shares).

The goal of a covered call is to gain premium for selling the call. As such, it is in your best interest that the stock either drop slightly or stays the same. If the calls expire out of the money-meaning the stock did not reach the strike price-then nothing happens. You don't get assigned, don't sell your shares, and you get to keep the entire profit (minus transaction costs).

The other way to gain profit is to close the position early by buying a call. This way you don't need to wait to the expiration to take some profit.

Let's say you had 100 shares of the stock and you wanted to sell a CC at your average price which is 20 dollars. Let's say the contract is worth .80 so selling it would get you 80 dollars into your account. Now let's say that the price falls a little. As the price falls the price for the contracts will also fall. So let's say you expect it to bounce back up a little. Instead of waiting until the expiration, you could buy a call at the lower contract price. Let's say the contract went down to .40. In that case you would pay 40 dollars for the contract and net the 40 dollars in premium. If the stock rebounds, the price for selling a contract would go up and you could sell another.  You could also choose a different strike price or expiration to try and get more profits. 

The only potential problem with CC is if there is a huge run up and you get assigned the contract. If the stock price is above the strike price, then you still have to sell your shares at the strike price. Meaning you would have missed out on some profit. If it is far from expiration and makes a huge run, it still might be better to buy a call to cover-if the profits will outweigh the price you'll have to pay for the contract.

As long as you don't put yourself at too much risk with strikes far below your average, then CC are an easy way to generate profit. Do them enough weeks and something you have lost money on can turn even and allow you to sell at the lower stock price."
2021-05-10 14:15:46,wallstreetbets,Just make an excel doc with some different premiums and mess around with stock price. Calculate profits and break evens. You’ll understand far quicker that way.
2021-05-10 10:52:53,wallstreetbets,"If you want to think it's a consulting company, go right ahead."
2021-05-10 14:47:22,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the explanation. This type of information should be stickied somewhere, especially for a lot of bag holders its a good way to reduce your entry price.

I guess it makes sense to buy back and sell again on larger contract sizes since the commissions can ear into your profit. Not sure what a call to cover is but I'll see if i can get a youtube options crash course. It's so much more complicated than say stocks, futures, or FX which are all straightforward."
2021-05-10 14:19:15,wallstreetbets,Ok that makes sense and can help me figure out the optimal price to buy back a premium if the stock is going up and will hit the strike price soon.
2021-05-10 11:13:40,wallstreetbets,What is it? Eli5
2021-05-10 15:54:03,wallstreetbets,/r/thetagang is the place you want to be to learn the selling side of options.
2021-05-10 18:00:02,wallstreetbets,"No problem.

Just for reference, call to cover in this case means purchasing a call to cover your position (sold a call) .

In a covered call you are selling a call to someone. To get out of the contract early, you can buy a call to cover (also known as closing your position). In the above case, where I used this terminology, let's imagine you had sold a 20 dollar call and the price of the stock had shot up to 25 dollars.

If the expiration date was still a ways out and you thought it might go back down and wanted to sell the stock, you could then buy a call to close your position. Since the stock would have gone up, the price of the calls would most likely be higher than the premium you received for selling. So you would take a net loss on that, but still would make over 5 dollars per share more than selling at 20, so it might be worth it to close the position and sell the stock. The time to do this would be when the total profit (sell price of shares + premium for selling calls - cost to buy back those calls)  would be higher than just doing nothing and the contract  being assigned and you being forced to sell at 20 per share.

If I sold a 20 strike call for 80 dollars, I would immediately get 80 dollars. If the price of the stock went up to 25/share and you were assigned that option, you'd only be able to sell for 20/share which would be $2000 plus the 80 premium. You'd make 2080 in the sell.

However it might  be better to close the position. If you bought a call to close, and paid double so 1.60 per contract. That would cost you 160 dollars. So you'd be at -80. But l, you could then turn around and sell at 25/share which would net you $2500 minus the net 80 dollars from selling and buying. So your total profit would be be $2450 or over 300 dollars.

In both cases you are selling the stock, so it is more beneficial to sell at the higher price and take the slight loss when covering the initial sold call."
2021-05-10 18:30:14,wallstreetbets,"I chose a strike price and date that, if assigned before I coulda woulda shoulda bought back, would give me a return I can accept. 
Id est I own xyz at 20, price currently 21, I sell 24 cc. If I snooze on a run (it happens in my world) and its assigned I'll be pissed money was left on the table but am not going to bitch about a 20% gain +the call premium over what is for me always a relatively short time period."

2021-05-10 17:02:01,wallstreetbets,You specifically did not
2021-05-10 14:30:26,wallstreetbets,"Yup, fair point. Without linking those 15 DDs (lol) my only counter argument would be that we know there are ways to hide short interest, and it would be in the short's best interest to hide their short interest to make retail investors lose interest in the short interest.

So it really comes down to, do you think they're hiding their short interest or not? Well, the 15 DDs you mentioned lead me to personally believe that they are hiding their short interest, but I'm also not going to pretend like the short squeeze is a sure thing. Honestly it bothers me that we went from ""only risk what you're willing to lose"" to ""YOLO YOUR ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS!""."

2021-05-10 13:45:41,wallstreetbets,"It’s part luck and part skill. Day trading is an entirely different ballgame from ordinary investing, I honestly don’t know that much abou it. They’re using various strategies to capture gains from price fluctuations on a very short time frame (typically within the same day, hence calling them day traders). It’s not just playing meme stocks, although the volatility they generate can be used for some high risk strategies. 

I wouldn’t put that much weight on someone’s portfolio being around a million, but I do think it’s a skill and not just luck. Typically day traders are making a large volume of relatively small trades, and if they’re successful long term (spoiler: the vast majority of day traders aren’t), it tends to mean they’ve happened upon a strategy that actually works. But if the trader loses discipline, takes on too much risk, or doesn’t respond appropriately to market changes, even where their strategy was working before it can quickly lead to them losing their shirt."

Probably not, but his policies were quite racially motivated and designed not to benefit the black people they targeted, but only to benefit the Democratic Party.

The other statements are just crazy talk which is pretty common, and if it makes him ""a terrible human"" then there are a lot of terrible humans out there spouting crazy political bullshit. AOC being one of them, which is why I took the opportunity to compare them, since you opened the door for that."

2021-05-10 07:46:33,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-10 08:43:23,wallstreetbets,Being a peloton user of both the cycle and tread.  Was fortunate to get in early.  Peloton has a few things going against them.  1) vaccine. People want to get out more and do exercise outside the house. 2) shipping delays. They were have issues keeping up with demand. Now your looking at a few months min before the new tread gets out. 3) the recall. Just a kick in the balls but not the straw that broke the camelback. Don’t know how many are going to return it. The play is to do some putts to get your money back. I think the stock is a 50ish per share when it consolidates. They are subs service not a gym equipment service.  I think you can still make some cash there if you play both sides
2021-05-10 08:50:30,wallstreetbets,"Oof, neither the service nor the stock appeal to me. But other people love both. Good luck to you sir.

2021-05-10 16:55:41,wallstreetbets,Join the club retard - I put 30k into short dated calls the day before recall gate... Lost over 70% and panic sold at 'market' instead of setting limit orders - completely fucked my ass.. I learnt a strong lesson though.
2021-05-10 17:27:35,wallstreetbets,If it hurts put the seat back on the bike...
2021-05-10 19:21:42,wallstreetbets,I got burnt last week. Lost about 1k.

2021-05-10 07:41:07,wallstreetbets,"Idk how to short. I have a normal trading account (not margin) and idk how to leverage. I’ve been in since like $110 and bought more around $95. Then the recall news hit me from $17k—>$5k. Now idk where this will go, but I’ll either go bankrupt, or we go to the MOON!!"
2021-05-10 08:55:33,wallstreetbets,"Negative, heard he dumped like 50% of his portfolio into TSLA tho"
2021-05-10 15:11:37,wallstreetbets,The only thing this needs is to break the $90-$93 resistance. Then it’ll shoot to the moon. Lots of long-term investors (not value-investors) were looking to buy this at $80ish and did.
2021-05-10 07:28:44,wallstreetbets,Depends on what business you are in.
2021-05-10 07:28:45,wallstreetbets,"L, they killed one child which was tragic. Not downplaying it, but treadmills cause so many injuries and deaths annually so idk why it’s getting so much press and negatives. I mean it’s whatever I guess. I went from $18k —> $39k —> $5k. All my savings in there but I’m only in my 20s"
2021-05-10 07:35:02,wallstreetbets,"pfft; I put like 99% of the blame on the parents. As a father of 2 kids I'd never leave them alone with a running treadmill. Now it turns out that other treadmills have a guard at the end to prevent this; that's the only reason there's even any kind of angle to go at PTON with..... but meh, parents' fault."

2021-05-10 07:49:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah... before I doubled down, I made $5k on an option call and then put that money in at $95. The recall news and delay of the tread killed my portfolio, so far. Hoping to turn it around. Ya never know what could happen tomorrow or the next day :)"
2021-05-10 16:56:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this is where fundamental and technical analysis and risk tolerance is learned. When you lose your whole portfolio due to stupidity :))))"

2021-05-10 09:49:32,wallstreetbets,It is not necessary to short. You can buy puts of you think the stock will decline.
2021-05-10 09:59:02,wallstreetbets,You lost over 80% of your money? 🤣 Holy fuck. 😂
2021-05-10 08:25:57,wallstreetbets,"I heard about the poor kid who died, so I looked at the chart: clear head & shoulders pattern with technicals heading down.  So to play the short side, I bought a put strike $100, 2 months out to give it time.  Put was bought on a Monday morning, sold on Wednesday morning when PTON was barely above $100.  This gave me a 30% in basically 2 days.  I figured it would break below $100, but didnt want to chance it.  You can go short by: selling shares you dont have, buying a put, or (riskiest) sell a naked call."

2021-05-10 15:35:56,wallstreetbets,"If I didn’t believe, I would of sold at $18k loss. Here I am holding :)) Best of Luck to all those who are holding in this bloody mess"
2021-05-10 07:53:09,wallstreetbets,"Historically a lot of companies have had great success with their products even though people got killed by them.

The hysterical reaction to pton for one death is just that. Take a look at cars, in the us 42000 lost their life last year, still business is booming.

Escalators and elevators account for 30 deaths and 17000 injuries in the US every year.

I mean I feel sorry for the kid, just like most industrial machinery a treadmill is not a toy. The motor Will not blink when the load changes 220 lbs. It will deglove you or outright kill you, that's why they come with emergency stop that should be attached to your clothes. You wouldn't let your child play with the chainsaw and you shouldn't let your child play with gym equipment unsupervised.

Pton will recover, people will forget who got killed by who, from time to time someone is going to mention it in the gym, everyone will remember something like it happened, but who,what and why will be lost.

Also not financial advice etc."
2021-05-10 07:45:20,wallstreetbets,"Technically speaking, analyzing their financial reports, this won’t hit them too hard. They barely sell treadmills (in comparison to their bikes’ revenue and subscription service)

Edit: The outlook of the company itself post-pandemic might be shaky tho ngl"
2021-05-10 07:52:39,wallstreetbets,"No, killing people definitely comes before that"
2021-05-10 08:13:23,wallstreetbets,"I see no lies here. Bottom line pton relies on their name which is currently tarnished. Until they release some new ""safer"" product or a new ""campaign"" they stock will continue to struggle. Not like they will go bankrupt but lets just say they will be a ""discounted buy"" for quite some time. Aka if you bought high and still believe in the company, its a great time to average down. Also maybe a great time to buy in for the future! 

* also if you look at any list of ""top treadmills"" on the market based off of consumer reports you will not see Pton on any of the lists... they are being avoided.."
2021-05-10 07:49:48,wallstreetbets,They hit it big with the pandemic and use the profits to pay themselves instead of investing in the company and the products to ensure its longevity... Classic! ya they are fuckd
2021-05-10 08:37:41,wallstreetbets,I played that the day it came out.  No one cared for a month
2021-05-10 08:17:32,wallstreetbets,"I Will not touch the stock, but not because of the incident, but because i have no clue what the world of fitness will look the next 5 years.

This after the Dow closed at another record high on Friday, in spite of a non-farm payrolls number that fell dramatically short of forecasts.

Not all that much on the calendar today. No major data releases. Some earnings: Tyson Foods, Coty, Duke Energy, Marriott, Occidental, Simon Property.

This week will be all about the CPI report, out Wednesday. But a lot of this may not matter, and not just because the Fed has said they don’t care about inflation data right now. Starting to think that a rate hike is already priced in. Listen to the audio for that pontification. Not gonna type it."

Entertainment is going to suffer IMO.  People will find their basic needs are going to go up in price before they can get an increase in pay.  Entertainment budgets are the first to get cut by the average American family.  Emerging markets are also likely to lose investments as people try to pour into something more stable.

2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why MVIS will likely go very up in the next 2 weeks. Alright, this is my first DD here. Probably not going to make it through automod, so whatever, here goes wasted effort. What's my evidence?

Ok.

1. MVIS short interest was at 20% when that shit blew up to $28. What's FINRA showing us?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u2fe1pwoa9y61.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dc490e3692c72883298520fbb09c4a15185e791

A spicy, spicy 29%. Gee I wonder why it tanked instead of going to the 60-90 range?

2. Extremely bullish options chain set up.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vb7raozob9y61.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=18a844fd1144afc666197914e870828b3c8357c4

Unless all of these calls running from 15 to 20 are all WSB, the people that bought these aren't in the business of losing money. There's only 2 weeks until all of these expire, and going from 14 to 20 is no small feat.

3. Elliot Wave mumbo jumbo lookin' good, apparently.

&#x200B;

[lines on a graph](https://preview.redd.it/922a5j25c9y61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fc9a084cbb32b0247b14f8c9a1694cfe8dbac2e)

&#x200B;

[yup those are some lines right there.](https://preview.redd.it/hbt0rm17c9y61.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=32e65e5b5c23328a5f8622bb34dc627f5796144b)

The Elliot wizards say the next run up will is looking to be soon, and could go to 18 this week and 28 before the 21st. Can I back this up? No fuckin' clue. The info is out there, and it confirms my bias, so I put it in here. The wizards say that the price may likely (or hopefully) hit 12, as whenever MVIS hits the triple bottom support line it likes to rip the fuck up like nobody's business.

4. Other indicators show signs of a run up soon.

&#x200B;

[On the 4 hour, Stoch RSI, RSI, and MACD are on their way up.](https://preview.redd.it/o25pc1l7f9y61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fda48bf05e1517d24e26318881527dadd19c353)

Also, Mr. Fibonacci says that the next resistance point upward from 14.27 is between 16.93 (38.2% retracement of the 4 and 13 week low) and 17.51 (38.2% retracement of the 52 week high).

5. No earnings report. Apparently any sort of earnings report will tank a stock shorted or owned by citadel, regardless of how good or bad it is just to put us 'retailers' in our place(example- AAPL). But good news! I heard that several darkpools have been closed, so no more or less of the ""buy from the darkpool and sell on the open market to only impact the price negatively"" tactics. Is that what a short ladder attack is? IDK. Seems like Citadel can just nakedly short whatever the hell they want without repercussions anyway, so take with grain of salt.

Anyway, I don't pretend to fully understand all this shit, so it probably has more holes and a weaker foundation than a jenga tower ready to fall. Disclaimer- I have 40 19c's expiring on the 21st, so I need the hopium more than all of you.

Edit: Forgot to mention institutional ownership is at an all-time high, with Mitsubishi Asset management Co. tripling down on their position. Bullish af

2021-05-10 07:43:22,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for writing this up. I'm also seeing an uptrend line that held multiple times last week, which means it's a strong support now. Based on what I've seen here and in the MVIS subreddit, it's reasonable to expect around $19-$20 later this week."
2021-05-10 06:33:26,wallstreetbets,"Elliott Waves also predicted GME would hit $130,000-or so in 2022.

2021-05-10 06:51:48,wallstreetbets,I’m it long term
2021-05-10 10:52:29,wallstreetbets,"The fact that Mitsubishi just trippled their position means a lot.
As for the revenue, yes, its low, but is there another lidar company that has revenue that justifies their market cap?? Lazr and Velodyne have same ratios, but they do not have developed technology unlike MVIS. On top Mvis besides lidar has other technology like the one that Microsoft uses in their military contract worth 22Billion.( 500k revenue probably came from 220 mil defence contract Microsoft had in 2017).

This being said, because wsb came at the very wrong time before (3 days prior to announcement) its not likely that shorts would allow price to go up before may options expire, so ideal day is to buy it on May 20th. If buyout is announced on 26 th price is likely to be double of what it is today, if no buyout june 1st you can sell for the same price you purchased, so no really any risk. 

Had shares purchased at 11, so dont care if its trading daily at 14 or 18, looking for 31.73.

2021-05-10 09:38:31,wallstreetbets,Imagine caring about this quarters revenue when the 22B IVAS contract hasn’t kicked in yet or the part about the best LiDAR on the market.
2021-05-10 06:34:27,wallstreetbets,yeah- there's no product yet. Just tech in development and patents
2021-05-10 19:01:19,wallstreetbets,"> I've seen larger YOLO positions on WSB than MVIS's quarterly revenue.

The LIDAR technology will likely be fully developed by the end of the year. Best buy in price is at 12 bucks, don't know if we'll drop to that again though."

Well... just read some articles about it. ODG (=Osterhout Design Group) was bought by MSFT for 150m mainly to secure some IP, as Facebook bought Oculus VR for 2 billion. Oculus was the clear market leader back then. What we are talking now:

MVIS is our Oculus.

Luminar, Velodyne etc. is ODG."

This was after the March event. 

TA is useless in my opinion. 

Not advice"
2021-05-10 11:47:05,wallstreetbets,"Lol imagine thinking that they’re going to make money off the MSFT IVAS contract. Read their financials. Expected revenue all year from MSFT - $3M. All of which was already paid to MVIS and is on their balance sheet as a liability, every quarter they recognize some of it (less than $500k 1Q) as revenue. They already have the cash. Zero upside."
2021-05-10 11:35:38,wallstreetbets,"Given that both of those things are already priced in, lets just hope they turn out not to be horseshit."
2021-05-10 11:34:58,wallstreetbets,Shame it is priced like a company with an actual product. This should be a penny stock.

2021-05-10 12:28:58,wallstreetbets,"Last time I checked, apes come here, read 'buy pltr' and go to RH Margin, where every dollar they buy is turned into a RH SHORT DOLLAR to short the crap out of it. So they watch the stock go up, and then when the time is right, short the crap out of it, to get you to paper hand and sell. It's called 'double fucking you' with your money as they make money on the shorting, and they make money when you lose and sell. So I fully expect it to go up, but like all things in WSB, be warned it will get shorted and fall. This is not financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor."
2021-05-10 09:14:29,wallstreetbets,"How are their competitors behind? They have completed phase a, have started manufacturing, and have partnerships that will be putting sensors in concept vehicles by Q4/Q1.

MVIS is hoping to have manufacturing setup by Q1.

Best tech doesn't win, cash, market share, and unit cost do."
2021-05-10 09:03:19,wallstreetbets,"If they actually start manufacturing things, that 75M will go pretty quick, likely within a year. They have to pay the manufacturing costs _and_ hire a sales/marketing team. Their expenses will only increase and increase significantly from here, with little chance of revenue for 6 months.

If the NDAs were suppressing information, we should see a lot more licensing revenue."
2021-05-10 09:10:15,wallstreetbets,"That ODG buy takes a potential buyer (MSFT) off the table and values the AR scanners at $150M. ODG was the main competitor for the army contract, which means MSFT likely doesn't need MVIS now. 

Oculus was much different since it had a complete, manufactured product and revenue associated with that product. MVIS does not have a complete AR/VR product so can't be compared to Oculus.

That leaves the automotive LIDAR. Competitors are at least 6 months ahead of MVIS with more cash and revenue."
2021-05-10 11:53:40,wallstreetbets,"You’re missing the 22B part with at least 120,000 units. It’s also highly likely there’s more than 1 MVIS unit inside each device to explain the much wider FOV than the Hololense 2. Hololense 2 is mostly an institutional product thus far. 

IVAS will revolutionize the future of how the US ARMY operates. Hololense 2 is a massive part of the future of Microsoft. Microsoft Mesh explicitly evidences how teams will evolve to integrate Hololense 2 and MR. 

I’ve been long since it was under $1 and fighting to regain NASDAQ compliance. MVIS has been criticized by Reddit since the days it was still part of the daily Pennystock subreddit. I will happily hold until MVIS proves WSB wrong and until MVIS secures a buyout/strategic partnership."
2021-05-10 12:32:03,wallstreetbets,can't wait for the margin calls then
2021-05-10 14:05:19,wallstreetbets,"Absolute nonsense. There are certain situations where best tech (that also looks the best, people aren’t going to be driving around in those monstrosities the competitors have) most definitely does win in the long run. There’s this company called Tesla you may have heard of that tapped into this concept and won."
2021-05-10 11:42:40,wallstreetbets,We’ll see more licensing revenue when more product is in demand. The NDA keeps stock price down because the owner of the IP is unable to advertise the good news.
2021-05-10 14:17:31,wallstreetbets,"MVIS isn't getting billions of dollars in government subsidies to bring their product to the market faster.

Be interesting to see how Tesla holds up now that not only small companies like NIO and canoo are coming, but also the big manufacturers like Ford.

Beyond that though, the LAZR concept vehicles look pretty nice. That's what happens when you have actual partnerships with companies like volvo and daimler."

Tesla is building new engines, new power stations, new autonomous technology etc etc - all sexy stuff, but horrendously expensive - the timeline for a positive ROI is much longer for Tesla."

Are you trolling?"
2021-05-10 10:09:50,wallstreetbets,None of that is true.  The iMacs & eMacs were wildly popular.  Their titanium powerbook g4 became the it laptop.  OS X came out in 2000 (beta) / full release 2001 and was highly usable by 2002.  iTunes launched in 2001 (rip mix burn).
2021-05-10 14:03:15,wallstreetbets,"Hard hard disagree on this (blows my mind that you have so many upvotes). The growth and innovation Apple had in the next decade all started with the moves Steve made in the late 90's dotcom bubble. 

https://www.cultofmac.com/442280/apple-history-imac-g3-arrives/

Steve came in, simplified the product line (A hybrid of pro and consumer lines that Apple still uses to this day). The iMac G3 was one of the best reviewed PC's of the 90's. Mac OSX (which is still used today) was developed and made public in 1999. The iBook (which started the insane laptop market growth Apple is still experiencing to this day) was introduced in that time. The iPod was by far the best reviewed music player (the only gripe was lack of windows support but even that was solved before the mini). I could write 2 more paragraphs about things steve did in that 5 year span. The fact that you start out with ""Old guy here"" and you missed the boat on these things is troublesom.

Saying that ""printers didn't work reliably on their products"" (which again, was solved with OSX which was previewed in 1999) is akin to saying that EV chargers aren't as ubiquitous as they should be. Short sighted gripes that were/are destined to be wiped out as the product/market matures."

You just read the chart wrong. the move from GME 20 to 400 is a 20x move. the VW was 200 to 900ish which is 4.5x. 

The equivalent of the VW short squeeze was GME going 20 to 90. 

Except you somehow managed to fail to do base math when you saw that chart, and thought 900/200 somehow equals out to same factor of 1000/20.  You made a shit trade, and didnt do even basic DD with the GME squeeze.

2021-05-10 06:29:36,wallstreetbets,"Steve Jobs hype didn't really take off until after the ipod.  Before his return most people just wrote off Apple as x86 was taking over the world, and outside of Education and Content Creation (which in a pre-social media world was basically gated to professionals only) they were losing incredible amounts of market share.  This is in an era where every two years x86 processor speeds were doubling, the PC was still king despite the rise of the internet, and Mac hardware based on PPC chips just could not keep up.  PCs were starting to takeover this market as well.  Audio and Video applications that relied on real-time capture were an absolute mess on PCs for architectural reasons but the raw power of x86 was starting to allow companies to just throw muscle at the issue.  Meanwhile the performance advantages for applications like Photoshop and versions on PC and Mac reaching feature parity made it incredibly compelling to switch.  Apple did not have a bright future.

His return was seen as potentially righting the ship, and was hugely welcome by the Apple faithful.  But it wasn't until OSX and the ipod (both released in 2001) that the cult of Jobs and Apple entered the hype mode you're familiar with."

The early versions of the iPod were all curiosities until the Mini and then the iPod really took off with the Nano.  Apples approach to Microsoft all through the 00's and first half of the 00's was a constant stream of lawsuits.  Macintosh never made any headway against Windows until Bill Gates left Microsoft and Steve Ballmer released a series of just incredibly terrible products.  

The simple fact of the matter is that Steve Jobbs was a terrible CEO.  When Apple succeeded it was in spite of Jobbs, not because of him.  He was responsible for things like intergenerational FUD campaigns against Microsoft.  His dithering around with experimental CPU's long past their sell by date held the platform back.  The Apple brand did not really start to shine as either a computer company, or an investment vehicle until he was gone.

They’re the only company that’s focused on vertical integration. In-house built batteries will translate to better profit margins for future vehicles and far more competitive pricing. Software? Again better feedback loop translates to faster changing software launches. Meanwhile legacy automakers still have customers come into dealerships to update their cars software lols.

For one , $150M was more symbolic than anything. Apple was still a multi billion dollar company at the time and the financial problems they were having were not solved by a paltry $150M. 


The deal was important for other reasons. 

For Apple, it was a symbolic gesture from Microsoft that they were not abandoning MacOS. This was very important because if Macs lost the Office suite, it would have been devastating. This was pre-Google docs, there were no widespread alternatives to office. 

For Microsoft, it was important for a couple reasons. 
First, it helped their antitrust issues. “Supporting” Apple was a way to show they weren’t being anti competitive. 

At the same time, it bolstered support for Internet Explorer. Every single Mac would ship with Explorer as the default browser. 
Remember, at the time Microsoft was trying to snuff out all browser competition. Netscape was popular on Macs back then. 

So yes, the deal helped Apple and MS, but it didn’t save them from bankruptcy and the money was an insignificant part of the deal."

Tesla themselves does not even make solar panels. Tesla is literally doing solar installs for a loss right now to corner the market.

Batteries are probably their play, but it’s a market that has a relatively low barrier to entry. So while they have a few year lead on others, its only a matter of time till batteries become like solar where the production is totally optimized for maximum profits meaning they will face stiff competition. 

Same thing with Charging Networks. Tesla is probably 5 years ahead of Electrify America and various other charging providers. It’s expensive, but overtime this gets optimized for maximum profit and again Tesla ends up facing stiff competition.

The only thing Tesla has an advantage on is their own ecosystem kinda like Apple, but their ability to expand like Apple doesn’t really exist. It’s easier to convince everyone to buy a $600 phone than it is to buy a $40k car. 

The only distinct item Tesla has going for them is they’re data collection for self driving and autonomous automobiles. Nothing else Tesla does really has a barrier to entry that prevents others from eventually catching up, with the exception of semi autonomous driving right now."

Their cars are subpar for the price, and under-engineered for the duty life we have come to expect from internal combustion engines, with nearly 0 aftermarket OE supply chain which is going to make owning a used out of warranty tesla a nightmare. 

But, I think the real secret is possibly TSLA becoming the amazon of energy. A vertically integrated ecosystem for renewable energy consumption. If they ever figure out the residential solar tech and integrate homes with their power wall Tesla will position itself more like Apple which streamlines the experience within the ecosystem. 

I think the future of energy utilities is decentralized power. Everyone will have battery arrays in their home and they will either soak up generated power from their home solar, or top off intelligently during off peak periods. Then during peak power grid draw times the batteries will siphon back into the system up to the personally allotted amount and help reduce the generation demands to smooth out the curve. Probably end up seeing this incentivized through tax credits and energy bill deductions in the future. I think eventually these types of decentralized home battery systems will replace the megapack and suit a similar purpose.

2021-05-10 15:08:23,wallstreetbets,"That's not necessarily fair either, as Net profit is after reinvesting into the company's future.

If they stopped reinvesting, just to get more net profit on paper, I doubt you'd think that was a good move.

And even then, Net profit is up 700% YoY."
2021-05-10 18:43:50,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. I work in the auto industry. EVs had no hype 8 years ago compared to now. The Model S was still a niche product from some boutique manufacturer in California that almost no one in the general public knew anything about. Tesla has done a great job growing their brand, but serious competition is here.

They might have gained some brand recognition but it's nothing compared to the established brands in most vehicle segments. How well do you think a cybertruck is going to stack up against an electric F-150 or Silverado when you poll the average truck-owning southerner or midwesterner? Not well at all."
2021-05-10 16:11:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah but they aren’t a Tesla
2021-05-10 08:50:16,wallstreetbets,"If you dont buy the assets its because your option is out of the money and you lost everything in expiration day.
I prefer options than futures, but with this implied volatily its way safer to just buy the underlying and just let it be for some years"

2021-05-10 17:42:22,wallstreetbets,As soon as a company does any stock buyback they should be barred from receiving any subsidies or government support. For at least a decade. If they want money they can sell stock on the open market.
2021-05-10 17:22:38,wallstreetbets,A classic move. And they'll probably get it because for some reason the government can't spend money appropriately.

2021-05-10 10:02:56,wallstreetbets,Don't discount how powerful it can be for a kid with autism to see that one of the richest (and sometimes \*the richest) men in the world is like him. It was a godsend for my son to hear Elon say he is autistic.  His mother told him he was disabled because of his autism and that damage vanished in one instant.  His attitude is completely different now.  The boy is unstoppable.
2021-05-10 13:01:59,wallstreetbets,I think the people who absolutely despise Elon are the jealous ones. I think Tesla is a bubble and I've been annoyed at the cult of Elon for a while but I mean there's no reason to hate a guy just because his car company is over valued

It might be a good tool for lane correction/cruise control but there's no way you won't need a driver at the wheel constantly at the ready to take over.

2021-05-10 15:38:27,wallstreetbets,I've never been a big apple user and am one of those Linux people who kind of dislikes both windows and Mac but I bought my gf one of those M1 MacBook Pros for school and have to admit I've been pretty blown away by how good it's been. I've never bought a MacBook but I'm considering buying the same one I got her after seeing how well it's handled all of her grad school bullshit. It's probably one of the only times I'd say that it's a good value for an apple product.
2021-05-10 13:02:27,wallstreetbets,"M1 is great but lets be real, how much of Intel's product stack was made obsolete by that chip? By the sound of some of these comments it sounds like apple just shat on intel but it's an ARM chip made for Apple products only. Intel doesn't make that many chips for apple so at most it would outcompete those chips but since m1 is 4high performance+4high efficiency=8cores it's only for low power apple parts. Doesn't affect Intels beloved servers etc, it can't compete with x86 in many instances no matter the performance."

2021-05-10 10:17:33,wallstreetbets,it's been two days since your young son stayed up to midnight to see elon say he has autism on tv. what amazing things has he accomplished between then and now?
2021-05-10 17:02:52,wallstreetbets,This might be the most honest answer. You hate him because of his fans... or because he has fans?
2021-05-10 14:13:33,wallstreetbets,"No, I mean jealousy. You want to look so smart....

 adjective: **jealous**

1. feeling or showing **envy** of someone or their achievements and advantages

 noun: **jealousy**

1. the state or feeling of being jealous

&#x200B;

So whats the deal, you hating because he has fans? One thing nobody gives a good answer to, is what do you hate about him?"
2021-05-10 11:59:40,wallstreetbets,"I don't know about worshiping.. never met someone with an Elon shrine or praying to him.. I don't know, you just sound real salty and jealous. You hat his success, hate his money, hate his goals, or just hat the attention he gets? It's rhetorical, doesn't mate... Haters going to Hate."
2021-05-10 13:26:26,wallstreetbets,He means not considering a guy with an emerald mine a working stiff is propaganda.
2021-05-10 09:08:04,wallstreetbets,Not really a technicality when you’re talking about a 5 year gap of recovery lol kinda just being objectively wrong (like OP admitted)
2021-05-10 11:51:22,wallstreetbets,The iPod was just an MP3 player too.
2021-05-10 14:50:15,wallstreetbets,3rd party apps didn't exist before the iPhone 3G and App store was released in 2008.
2021-05-10 09:36:20,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure there is but then you're looking at price, the Mac air is a grand, no ryzen 5000 notebook with good battery and whatnot costs a grand or less, plus your link for AMD's new processor or something, not a specific laptop"
2021-05-10 09:31:10,wallstreetbets,"Personal preference, nothing objective to hate it for. My brother uses a Mac air and I just don't like the way everything is layer out and functions, don't get me wrong it does what it does perfectly but I think, in my opinion, windows does the fundamentals much better than Mac os, and as an example, in windows I can drag the window to the edge of the screen and it automatically fits into that half or quarter of the screen, in Mac os you either need to do it manually or use the task switching gesture thingy on the track pad. It's not objectively bad, just doesn't go well with the way I work"
2021-05-10 09:23:37,wallstreetbets,You could have just said “some people aint no fuckin nerds”
2021-05-10 09:28:37,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you think you need to build the Windows machine instead of buying a good brand like a Lenovo shows you don't know what you're talking about. Maybe don't buy $400 Windows laptops and compare it to your $1400 Macbook and you won't have this problem. I have a MacBook and two Windows laptops and none of my computers give me any issues. It's 2021. Not 2009.

The fact is, Macs are great. You just need to pay a lot more. If you pay the same amount for a Windows as a Mac, you're going to get a good ass machine. The issue is that people value Windows less so they spend less on them then they wonder why their PC sucks. For Macs, there is no option to spend less. The cheapest Macbook Air (which is a shit computer no matter what you say) cost over $1000."
2021-05-10 12:45:56,wallstreetbets,"A few years ago I was a dev at Apple and I also own a MacBook so not really sure what the ethos appeal is working here for me. If we want to quantify which computer is better based on the specs, for the same price Windows loaded machines are better a majority of the time. If we want to quantify which computer is better based upon the software that it can run, then Windows is better. If we want to talk about which computer you feel is better based upon you being used to using the machine for over a decade, then anything can be good. I'm talking about quantifiable attributes here and MacBooks do not do so well I'm that department. To me, it makes more sense that most people that like them more are just used to using MacBooks. The experience between Macs and Windows in 2021 is really not that different. Again, this isn't 2009 anymore."
2021-05-10 18:08:50,wallstreetbets,Doesn't change the fact that it's extremely high today. And the estimates are too bullish imo. But I do agree their pe ratio will drop as they increase revenue and cut down on expenses
2021-05-10 15:24:25,wallstreetbets,Solar revenue is up 70% YoY.
2021-05-10 15:34:56,wallstreetbets,"You have obviously never been in a Tesla, my friend."
2021-05-10 19:14:56,wallstreetbets,"I mean in a vacuum that would be a good case to avoid lithium, but compared to fossil fuels I don’t think there is any logical argument that can be made to say that we shouldn’t keep developing clean/renewable energy sources as an alternative.

Unless you’re willing to give up your iphone for a 2 stroke motor powered phone the justification for buying home appliancez or electronics with batteries but not scaling it up to meet daily energy requirements holds no water with me"
2021-05-10 16:17:38,wallstreetbets,"Yes exactly, lithium ion batteries are hard to recycle. Also hard to extract the lithium. And have to be replaced. Solar power conversion also creates esmok which is bad for you. 

Look normal cars have become wayyy more efficient than they used to be and it keeps going that way. They also don’t produce long lasting waste. Except for the car itself. But that can be recycled rather easily in comparison to lithium."
2021-05-10 19:18:09,wallstreetbets,"Dude your home is already full of ac to dc converters to power home appliances, phone/electronics chargers, etc. I have no clue what esmok is but if that is a concern you better not hook anything to your wall outlets."
2021-05-10 19:19:06,wallstreetbets,I doubt it is vision that will come to fruition in 24 mo but I wouldn’t be surprised if we had made huge leaps towards that and more of a focus on residential battery power once demand for vehicles is met.
2021-05-10 13:59:28,wallstreetbets,"Also if robo-taxi works, it will be either not legal or taxed to shit in many countries. Uber vs taxists is already a shitshow in europe and it will be nothing compared to the shitshow that companies buying self driving cars that dont generate taxist jobs would cause."
2021-05-10 16:24:12,wallstreetbets,Imagine driving on the Autobahn at 280km/h and have to switch 3 lanes. They would have to build a quantum computer into every single car 😂😂
2021-05-10 15:02:33,wallstreetbets,"> that will never be reliable enough to literally trust with your life

It's already safer than a human driver."
2021-05-10 17:13:21,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I have seen their autopilot at work. I use it at least 80%+ of the time when I drive my S. And while it is not level 5 by any stretch, it is far more than lane correction/cruise control which is what most other vehicles have. Autopilot actually navigates, takes off-ramps and on-ramps, actively changes lanes to pass vehicles, etc with no intervention (aside from confirmation you still have your hand on the steering wheel or are responsive in some form). It is far more advanced than the impression you are giving in your comment which leads me to believe you are not familiar with it at all."
2021-05-10 13:31:31,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't be super sure about this, sure the 'algorithm' is old, but there are multiple economies of scale coming into play: hardware for training/inference, as well as cars on real roads collecting data. Which is basically the story behind the success of machine learning in general (neural nets old as shit, but compute/data was never quite there)

I am pretty confident that we've hit the inflection point for self-driving trucks to be inevitable (easier problem + humongous financial incentive), which further adds to the scale of the entire space"
2021-05-10 15:04:36,wallstreetbets,"> they have shitty overpriced car

...The Model S Plaid is literally the fastest production car ever made in a quarter mile. All while having better safety ratings and internal comfort than most super cars and hypercars..."
2021-05-10 16:31:53,wallstreetbets,"Haha Apple is good tho. They have price control because they are one of a kind. Tesla has competition which is already better than them. 

Apple does provide best quality and design and innovation. And sells it well. 

Tesla has bad quality and sells it for the same price as a luxurious car from German competitors

Like apples new privacy thing shows that they do care about consumers."

the benefits are that they produce a lot less heat and require a lot less electricity while providing similar results to x86 farms. 

and those two benefits (less heat, less electricity) are huge when you are talking about a whole room of servers"
2021-05-10 14:31:06,wallstreetbets,"I get where this is coming from. At a near future perspective, M1 isn't a threat. It's the implication of M1 that makes it a bad sign for Intel. ARM is improving at a high rate. Less power, less heat, good performance. ARM server farms are set to become a reality. Not today, but soon. 

When Intel talks about being a year or two behind, they dont mean apple, they mean in the NM space on general. TDP  And performance per watt is becoming king in a lot of futures discussions in IT rooms across the US. Right now, Intel might lead in performance in a lot of areas, bit a year from now a lot of ecosystems are going to run to competitors (AMD) or even apple in some rare few environments (since apple killed server hardware but kept the serverOS, I only really see this in small marketing and graphic design businesses).

I still think in 3 to 4 years, Intel will be at the top again, but expect them to dip for a little while as they work it all out. 

(Intel likely to still reign for gamers though, can't imagine anything otherwise.)

As for Musk, I get why people like him.  He delivers nothing, but he DOES actually offer at least the hope of space someday.  Under the neo-liberal regime, even that dream has been denied as cost-ineffective, so people flock to Musk as the only one even promising to try.

The committee has focused its attention on three kinds of adverse health effects that have become the chief concerns of the public and of health officials. These are cancer, primarily childhood leukemia; reproductive and developmental effects, primarily abnormalities and premature pregnancy termination; and neurobiologic effects, primarily learning disabilities and behavioral modifications. Each of those effects has been reported in epidemiologic studies to be associated with exposure to some indirect estimates of the strength of power-frequency electric and magnetic fields. Childhood leukemia has attracted the most attention because of studies conducted in Denver, Los Angeles, and the Nordic countries that reported an increased risk of the disease in association with various indicators of exposure to electric or magnetic fields.

You can get close but no cigar.  


This is just from the technical standpoint. Not to mention that once a car's controls are linked to the internet that opens up the possibility of hacking/somebody remotely taking control of your vehicle, which is a whole other can of worms. I will personally never get a self-driving car until they become ""mandatory for public safety"" or some shit. Plus every car will need multiple cameras which will exponentially increase the dystopian surveillance state. I mostly hate this ""automated driving"" hype for these kinds of reasons.

2021-05-10 13:37:09,wallstreetbets,Engineers have already built things that consume it.  This isn't some technological revolution on the verge of happening and hinges on Nokia of all companies.
2021-05-10 18:12:06,wallstreetbets,"They’re launching “Bluewalker3” later this year which will fully validate their tech. This is more to validate their satellite design as they’ve already proven communication with a standard cellphone from space works. They plan to launch in 2022 with coverage around the equator. Omnispace is the only other true competitor but is much further behind. ASTS already has partnerships and large investments from Vodafone, AT&T, Samsung and Bell Canada. They have the first mover advantage."
2021-05-10 09:51:28,wallstreetbets,They got a pretty deep moat if you actually look into it. The “large companies” are choosing to do exclusive partnerships with them instead. Even Nokia won’t be able to connect direct to satellites (using the same amount of transmitting power as today) without infringing on their patents.

2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Inovio is worth looking into ($INO)  Most people, that have an investing interest in a company, care very little about whether or not they provide a meaningful benefit to the world. Investing is about making money, that's a given. The idea of investing in something that can save lives AND give a substantial return on investment, should be a no-brainer for everyone. Pharmaceutical stocks promise this regularly and rarely follow through. Inovio seems different. They have been working on several viable treatments for decades. The most recent reports suggest that their cancer vaccines are groundbreaking. Their DNA COVID-19 Phase 2 results are showing incredibly high efficacy with little to no side affects. They have a patented delivery system that is marketable on its own. In my humble opinion, this company seems like it will follow through. I have no relation to this company. I am not a financial advisor. I just wanted to share what I think about a company that I believe can make a difference going forward"

They have a Covid 19 vaccine in P3 in China/ P2/3 here. They have evidence that there vaccine would help in several variants. They just went to P3 in China for cutting edge technology for cervical cancer. 1st ever vaccine in the world. They are involved with a IPO partner Addvaccine in Hong Kong. It's about to go public and give INO funding. They have 400M in cash. Looks there website on career page. Hiring a Sr person for EU product development. 

Look at REGN 20 years ago/ no product.  There a 55B mkt cap. 

43% is IO/ very impressive for a company with 0 Rev.

Unfortunately,  China will bring there 4800 vaccine to commercialization.

If the valuation were near 20 Billion like NVAX I would be a lot more hesitant to invest but at 1.5B it seems like a solid chance to double my money. Time will tell."

2021-05-10 06:08:20,wallstreetbets,"I’m not interested. Biology, and finance are my passions. I’ll take virtually any opportunity to talk about it. INO holders frequently make wild claims like “this company will cure cancer”, suppress any information that doesn’t fit the narrative, and AstroTurf positive sentiment. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and I do have evidence that I’m willing to share. Or just search “INO” on this sub, click on any thread, and sort by controversial. 

In all of my time in biotech I have never come across more aggressive supporters of a company. Science is about peer-review. If an investment thesis can’t handle a tiny bit of criticism it’s probably not a good investment. A lot of people get turned off from biotech because they’ve been burned a lot. People should know the risks before any investment."
2021-05-10 12:35:46,wallstreetbets,"I heard from INO employees directly who felt the FDA were holding them back and I have seen tons of allegations on Reddit and Stock twits but I doubt that FDA corruption is really the cause of delays. I feel it's likely Inovio was slow on the development of their medical device for INO-4800, the electroporation device. This was the source of the hold, ""questions about the cellectra device"" as the FDA put it. Commercialization of VGX-3100 is first in line in their pipeline and that uses a different device than the INO-4800 electroporator. Inovio needs to fully develop and manufacture tens of thousands of these for Covid, many more than a vibrant HSIL treatment business requires.  VGX-3100 wasn't going to demand finished electroporation devices untill 2022 so I think a lot of the delay is to allow for the medical devices to catch up to the drugs.

Additionally the US military funds Inovio and runs their clinical trials on a host of pipeline drugs. That relationship must have lead to confidentiality agreements. This is another reason I dismiss criticism for a lack of communication with shareholders."

Hear me out, the problem with the current arrangement is the pre-order flow. To the regular trader, even a day trader, a partial cent or two per transaction won't matter.  But to  HF or MM running orders in dark pools or as single shares to manipulate a price up or down, this would affect their profits due to volume.  Add some sludge into the system to slow reduce the benefit of this front running.  The money can go to the SEC and reduce their budget costs, or a charity, or wherever.

2021-05-10 06:13:49,wallstreetbets,"It would make investing cheaper for poor people. Robinhood is more expensive than the alternatives:

> The SEC said that Robinhood benefited from completing trades at prices that were less than optimal for its clients. In aggregate, those fees deprived customers of $34.1 million, even after taking into account the savings from the commission-free trades.

[Taken from the statement about the fine Robinhood received for misleading investors](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/17/investing/robinhood-sec-settlement-deceptive-practices/index.html). Looks like it worked."

If you have a broker that doesn't provide higher frequency trading options, then maybe. Imo there are plenty of vendors that offer a flat monthly fee, instead of commission (if you believe you're such a baller). If you got $1000 to your name, then maybe HFT wasn't minted on you to begin with. If the trade-off is that small-investors need to be more patient and trade less I consider it a big win. You could easily argue that daytraders lose more money on jumping in and out of bad trades, than they would paying commission and holding."

2021-05-10 10:20:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah exactly, that's my point.

Not even necessarily day traders. Even if you trade weekly options (which seems to be pretty popular around here).

Look at how many options trades you do, multiply by $5/trade +  $0.65/contract on both sides of the trade, and see how it affects your bottom line.   It adds up!"
2021-05-10 10:12:02,wallstreetbets,"You miss the point.

First, no one is letting you trade for a dollar commission.  Before PFOF the industry had settled on about $5.

So say you make a hundred trades a year (2 per week).  You pay $500 in commission.

Say you have an extra $1000 to play with.  If you pay $500 in commissions that year you need to be up 50% for the year to break even after commissions.  Good luck with that.  You are priced out; it just doesn't make sense for you to trade.

Even if you have an extra $10k to play with in a year, paying 5% of your capital in commissions is a significant headwind.

So, yeah, a significant part of the population gets priced out, and the market becomes only for rich people again."
2021-05-10 13:57:39,wallstreetbets,"I'm not saying that it doesn't have its merits, but it is not a system that works for all. There has to be losers to be winners. I just think we can find a better system, but we can't do that without trying new things.

Everything is tracking you everywhere.  PLTR has the experience to capitalize on that.  Therefore they should grow exponentially as well.  The sky's the limit for the company, it's just a waiting game.  I think of it like GOOG.  They built a great product and then just let that compound year over year with better algorithms, better data, etc.  PLTR is at that beginning right now.  You can look at any big stock name and they've all had ups and down and periods when no one believed in them.  That's kind of normal.  The market isn't rational and if you expect it to be it'll drive you crazy.  Just ignore the noise, buy low and stay the course."
2021-05-10 07:29:56,wallstreetbets,"Reason they haven’t been showing profit is because they’ve been building their infrastructure. If you look at the numbers, Amazon and Tesla didn’t show profits right out of the gate either"

We'll be holding another month til we see any big turnaround imo. Positive sentiment will come with that also. I think now is a time to buy get close to that floor before the bounce back. *Not financial advice"

Have to wait and see what proves to be correct.

Could OP's far otm bets pay off? Sure. Could they expire worthless and OP is back where he started? Sure. OP has to ask himself is he's gonna fine going back to $0 or is he's gonna put a shotgun into his mouth. If the answer is shotgun then fucking sell out now and buy actual stock!"

You’re positive outlook is inspiring though. 🤣"

2021-05-10 09:39:50,wallstreetbets,OP obviously enjoys burning money. Using Robinhood is like burning money with a flamethrower instead of just a lighter.
2021-05-10 12:40:47,wallstreetbets,I for the life of me will never understand how these legit retards can still have faith in RH.
2021-05-10 14:49:35,wallstreetbets,"OP probably paid more than $30k to citadel/robinhood for poor fills. That's the reason why most robinhood trades have you at an instant -3% to -10% when you buy. With a $500k account, he probably lost about 15k to 50k just for using robinhood."
2021-05-10 00:14:57,wallstreetbets,It’s all good! I’d just like to pay these taxes next year and give a lot back to the community. My heart is with these stocks and I believe in them.
2021-05-10 15:45:25,wallstreetbets,OP should take his blinders off and read this comment a couple times over

2021-05-10 16:07:07,wallstreetbets,they are reporting losses per share. but that is because they invested heavily in marketing. They are an official sponsor of the NFL so perhaps football season can bring the stock up again.. not sure.. Also the olympics are coming up but I am not sure how that works and if they will be doing that.. Lets see I guess
2021-05-10 14:44:10,wallstreetbets,GME. Took some profits and got back in.
2021-05-10 18:09:38,wallstreetbets,"Not sure. If I was a hedge fund with endless capital, I’d be real real long on them."

2021-05-10 02:13:22,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's possibly the most in-your-control scenario in all of life. It is 100 percent in your control to close your positions and realize no further losses."
2021-05-10 03:27:40,wallstreetbets,First—didn’t even notice. Second—time to get it back. Third—fuck that didn’t work.
2021-05-10 09:13:34,wallstreetbets,After the first 100k in the red you could have realized you timed it wrong and pulled out.  Sometimes you just need to cut your losses and onto the next trade.
2021-05-10 04:38:28,wallstreetbets,It’s amazing what you become comfortably numb with. God bless you Sir. I hope you come out on top soon.
2021-05-10 06:41:17,wallstreetbets,Im sure your GME will come good. Not sure about the others tho. Hope they do. Good luck
2021-05-10 13:17:15,wallstreetbets,There are many of us friend. I rode 750k down in Jan now only down 500k from peak. The patient will be rewarded. The fun is only just beginning.

All this is just speaking on hindsight. If its house money he doesn't need and this is stocks and not options, ""buy and hold"" by all means.  The stock market always gets worse before it gets better."
2021-05-10 12:06:11,wallstreetbets,"On top of that, they're all options. So even if he's bullish on the stock, he's got a lot of catching up to do in a hurry before those expire."

2021-05-10 12:41:11,wallstreetbets,"Yes but pretending to be hyped about it in order to hype up others into getting emotionally invested in it works in your favor by increasing demand.

InB4 some child goes wide-eyed and realizes that's manipulation - YES! It is! Nobody who owns a stock should ever be allowed to talk about it, because speaking positively of a stock you own may increase demand for it! Except that this is a universal principle. If everyone who owned rural property constantly talked shit about it, demand would drop right? If they all go on and on about how great it is, demand will rise. But what if a billionaire buys half of it and starts a marketing campaign to promote and praise rural living? Then it's *billionaire manipulation*, not just *random schmuck manipulation*.

This principle affects everything. Dogs, cars, types of faces/hairstyles, stocks, forms of government, garlic..."

See it like this: OP's PLTR stock is currently worth 35,000 USD. 

If someone gave him 35,000 USD right now - would he invest it in PLTR?

2021-05-10 07:28:55,wallstreetbets,"Replace ""stock"" by ""confidence"" (or ""faith""), and you're right. 

If you believe in a stock, buy or hold. If you don't believe in a stock, sell it. It's stupid to hold a stock you don't believe in.

OP believes in the stock, so he should hold. 

If he *doesn't* believe in the stock but only holds because that's supposed to be cool... that's not the brightest idea."
2021-05-10 16:36:11,wallstreetbets,"Yes, selling and buying back in would in practice be a silly thing to do. 

But it's a good mindset to have. People often think of holding stock as a ""passive"" action, and selling or buying as an ""active"" action. 

But that's not true. Holding is the same as buying. Every second you hold is basically you re-buying the stock over and over again. 

I suck at explaining it. 

Your stock and its value are interchangeable. If your stock is worth $100, it's the same as having $100 cash in your pocket. 

If you wouldn't use the $100 cash in your pocket to buy the stock, you shouldn't be holding it. 

Anyway, you're right; I just suck at using words."
2021-05-10 07:26:34,wallstreetbets,"It's not about hindsight or even paper handing - it's about still believing the stock is worth it. 

If you believe the stock is worth it, you should hold. 

If you don't believe it's worth it, why hold? 

If you hold stock worth 35,000 USD, that's the equivalent of 35,000 USD cash. At every single second you could ask yourself ""What is the best purpose for 35,000 USD cash?"" 

Can you think of something better to do with that money than buy this stock?

If you can, you should sell and do those better things. But if you believe this is the best thing to do with 35,000 USD, then you should hold."
2021-05-10 12:19:44,wallstreetbets,"Uh, no it's not.

Holding it as it decays in value is diamond handing.

Selling before then to stop the bleeding isn't paper-handing, otherwise everyone would always be either diamond-handing or paper-handing."
2021-05-10 15:04:07,wallstreetbets,Cause any retard with that much equity or bp should or at least know that they be able to advantageously positions themselves by selling retarded theta OTM options to other retards. That’s basically why hes hurting lol

2021-05-10 18:06:37,wallstreetbets,I mean I get what you’re saying. It honestly comes down to what you as an investor believe is the best strategy. For some that is holding because they believe that the risk of basically wasting theoretical gains on other stocks and having tangible losses on their current hold is worth the possibility of the hold turning out how they envision with massive gains. I will agree though that the idea holding has no consequences on your other investments is foolish since it’s basically sinking money when it could be used in other plays.
2021-05-10 13:38:03,wallstreetbets,Explain the difference between “decays in value” and “bleeding” ? 😂
2021-05-10 15:11:59,wallstreetbets,"Sure, they should.

And yet one look through that guy's profile and I can see that guy owns all shares (PLTR) and doesn't trade options.

Hopefully everyone's made some change from that record week. Now we're getting Brazil weather-related shortages for soy. Anyways that's something else and a market I don't understand that well. Seems like buying any softs = money. From the last update, I'm up around 40k from my initial investment of around the same. How did I lose money from DIS? idk man but the mouse always fucks you.

But not so fast! The market realities from last time still [stand strong](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n48yea/corn_ethanol_demand_lack_of_supply_odd_weather/). **But it might be time to take some profits.** 

*Remember for all soft commodities (ag, lumber) we're faced with a major supply/demand imbalance. Once this calms down and find an equilibrium, we are definitely going down. Maybe not to $2-3/bsh, but $4 is a real reality. If you're trading futures, you are probably already experienced in this. Just when the supply/demand imbalance is still in play, these commods can go much higher.* 

*For the new people on* r/wsb*: this does not mean diamond hands. There is no such thing as diamond hands in agricultural commodities (or industrial metals for that matter). You will be dragged off the floor once you get margin called, or when the supply/demand finds an equilibrium.* 

**Weather is improving**: As of right now, the link for the drought forecast is dead (blame the SEC, CFTC or regulators to prevent the price from going up?). But overall, we might be getting peak drought for the midwest and plains. Better weather is coming, with rains expected next weekend. 

&#x200B;

**Replanting and additional acreage**: One of the main reasons that lit the corn rocket was the [weak first quarter planting report](https://www.andersonsgrain.com/market-commentary/market-videos/usda-report/2021/mar-31/). That was when front month corn was in the mid $5s. $2 later, I'm hearing a lot of farmers trying to get more land to grow because $7 corn does not come often. The price boost is enough for them to take advantage. 

**USDA Data**: [Lots of data](https://www.usda.gov/media/agency-reports) for the new month are coming in this week. I've underlined the important ones for corn below. Prices will be volatile during this time. If the crop progress causes a drop in the price, I will probably start selling corn into the last half of the week. 

&#x200B;

**My corn**: Finally as a good sign, some of my corn are getting ears! We've gotten some good rains during the last week in South Texas. So now the hope is that no bad weather comes between now and September (or if bad weather does come, I'll be loading up on long futures again).

And for ags, when the bubble pops usually it doesn't recover (especially when the contract goes to the next month or settlement dates). I'm just updating to take profits where you can. If the crop reports are still weak, you bet I'm still buying."

2021-05-09 23:59:47,wallstreetbets,Gme is basically more guaranteed than a lottery ticket at this point. No reason not to get at least 1 share or a fractional one.
2021-05-10 16:57:16,wallstreetbets,"This is my biggest problem with the GME memes. Even if I could look past the cultishness of the community and the ubiquity of the memes, they’re just so unoriginal and unfunny.

Literally just take any scene from film or TV where a “good guy” beats a “bad guy,” slap “Melvin” and “apes” labels on there, and subtitle it with the same old subreddit lingo (stonks, to the moon, diamond hands, etc.), and post it to one of the several GME-devoted subs to reap infinite karma.

The memes were entertaining 3 and a half months ago, but now they’re just played-out and boring."

2021-05-10 11:39:56,wallstreetbets,"I’m so baffled by the phrase “more guaranteed than a lottery ticket.” You know lottery tickets have like a 1-in-a-billion chance of paying off, right? So saying something is “more guaranteed” than one doesn’t really mean much."

The bear thesis is that their software is terrible and that's why their premium to claim margin is 0%. They have no way to grow their way to profitability.

Bull thesis is that covid and delayed medical care made claims much higher than normal, and this quarter will see better margins. They have also expanded into 10 more states."

Who knows though, the way earnings go nowadays it seems like it’s a coin flip whether an earnings report will result in an increase or decrease. I guess it depends on how manipulated the stock is."
2021-05-10 13:26:05,wallstreetbets,I thought that only happened to me.
2021-05-10 00:12:00,wallstreetbets,I'm all over that.  Some people are worried about user hours spent online but I find it more impressive that hours online are the same or less yet earnings are doubling.  This means they have more successful monetization.  Bling bling
2021-05-10 08:58:30,wallstreetbets,I bought at direct listing as soon as it went live. I'm hoping there will be some catalyst in the next year to launch it into orbit. I have a very small holding though unfortunately. I spent the lions share of my funny money on $BB in the $20's and am stuck with that shit show of a short for now.
2021-05-10 00:30:41,wallstreetbets,"Unless they somehow managed to double their non governmental customers and revenue, yes.

If they do that, they will still probably be flat. Wall street sees PLTR as just ""another analytics company"".

2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"“In essence, the stock market represents three separate categories of business.” Take this quote by the original GME OG to heart: “In essence, the stock market represents three separate categories of business. They are, adjusted for inflation, those with shrinking intrinsic value, those with approximately stable intrinsic value, and those with steadily growing intrinsic value. The preference, always, would be to buy a long-term franchise at a substantial discount from growing intrinsic value.”

His fundamental tenets are 1.) Margin of safety is king 2.) look at ev/ebitda 3.) free cash flow. 4.) is it a well established franchise... 

If those hit the Mark... do your own damn research to know what those should be.. do a deep dive into the company and management. Because at the heart of his value investing is this: you don’t look just for value... you look for growth.. is it at a discount from growing intrinsic value that currently the market just isn’t seeing... 

Now if you look across this entire market at the moment, there is only one stock that hits all of this: ViacomCBS, VIAC. Do your DD.. see if it hits those basic metrics, then do the deep dive... for instance take a look at the most recent q1 ER call. 

I really don’t have much else to say. This, for those who know how to look for it, is the current Alpha in this market. It’s a sleeping giant... just do an even basic deep dive... or don’t. Really don’t care. This post probably won’t even make it to being posted!"
2021-05-09 23:45:23,wallstreetbets,"I just bought shares and those Q1 earnings were a big comfort.

Don't really have anything intelligent to add. They trade at a big discount compared to other media companies, even non-entities like Discovery or a slightly ""toxic"" brand like Fox, but VIAC did have shitty years leading up to 2019 when you look at their revenue and earnings growth. I think the bet is on whether the management can break out of that."

2021-05-10 01:49:59,wallstreetbets,"It’s also worth mentioning that in the recent q1 ER call, Bob Bakish, CEO, stated this in regards to Pluto TV - and it is easy to miss it’s significance: “We haven't actually pushed pricing on Pluto TV in the last two years. So it's really one of the most efficiently priced products on the marketplace, and that gives us a really great pricing lane going forward when we choose to pull that lever.” What he is saying, is at some point they can transform Pluto TV into a proper streaming TV service, like YouTube TV, that truly mimics cable TV... so they have the real possibility of creating an extremely competitive streaming cable alternative based on the already huge success of Pluto TV..."

Few people realize viac is behind a lot of the “original” content on Netflix and Amazon and this company has a diverse mix of distribution across direct to consumer and affiliate and they are 100% focused on delivering in streaming coming off the merger with CBS.

At a 10 PE ratio, 2.5% dividend and healthy books and plenty of recent upgrades it’s absolutely among the best value on the market."

2021-05-09 23:38:07,wallstreetbets,"Doing a screener on margin of safety, based on dcf analysis, brings up quite a few at 40% or more, even if you’re screening for stocks with a market cap well over a billion, you’ll get your starting point.. then, look at ev/ebitda, free cash flow to narrow it down... next, are any of these well known franchises... if so, what the hell happened to make it trade at such a discount, when it has decent free cash flow and an ev/evitda of 10 or lower... really look closer at those companies that pass this test, and see if management is aggressively pursuing growth... it’s actually not terribly hard, and yeah, you can narrow down over 2,000 stocks to just a handful. I have been hemming and hawing over Emergent Biosystems, but I don’t see management doing anything, and I don’t see them sustaining growth as we reopen... anyways, that’s Burry’s method.. it works, it is what landed him on GameStop.. the trick is to see what the market is missing.. I don’t think the market is really “missing” VIAC, but I think they are seriously underestimating what VIAC can do in terms of creating content, leveraging current content, the future power of Pluto TV, and how that will coalesce into something very powerful..."

2021-05-10 18:03:03,wallstreetbets,"Can you give me an example of something VIAC on Netflix / Amazon? Or can we have a conversation about the intrinsic value?

I'm intrigued by Nick / Nick Jr. Pretty sure kids still eat up Spongebob and Peppa Pig is def a recent hit. And I would assume MTV / Comedy Central are still big with teens (although I have no idea). I'd say it's reasonable to assume for households with children to young adults (6-26) paramount+ could be a must have. 

On the flip side, as a 34yo (the yo is short for yolo), I'm thinking about CBS.... I don't even consider CBS when I turn on the TV. I'd reckon to say I actively avoid it. I could mayyyyybe be moved by Showtime. Everything else I'm like meh"

2021-05-09 22:37:33,wallstreetbets,"Take a look at q1 ER... double digit growth yoy on almost all revenue streams. Added 6 million new subs, SVOD, Paramount+ primarily, whereas Netflix had only 4 million. Pluto TV is now the number 1 AVOD, 50 million MAUs globally... 1.7M fcf q1, another 2.5 billion from secondary, and Paramount Picture Studios is fully reopening and is gearing up to generate a ton of new content.. which is king... they are letting third party licensing deals with other streaming platforms expire, bringing that content to Paramount+ exclusive, they are dropping 1,000 premium movies on Paramount+ in early June, launching a massive ad campaign “Mountain of Movies”... and starting in 2022 will release a movie every week. They have aggressively pursued LatAm. and European markets... and then they have the number one prime time network, CBS, and all the live sports - NFL etc. - and live news, which seperates it even further from Disney+, Netflix, HBOMax... and so much more than this... Showtime -has premium channels top 2 current series - Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, BET, MTV, CMT, VH1...number 1 and 2 kids shows, Sponge Bob and Paw Patrol... but what I really like is they have the number one AVOD, Pluto TV, which acts as a super funnel into the SVOD, Paramount+... that is huge.. and advertisers are looking more towards AVOD as best ROI. So having the number 1 AVOD in the United States is a big deal..."

2021-05-10 15:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Some will point to debt, but they just paid it down $2 billion, and it’s only at a ratio of 1.6 or so I believe, a really good ratio is 1.0.. so can’t really argue debt is an issue. Then they’ll argue that the legacy side of the business is a drag, i.e. cable.. that it’s on a steep decline moving towards cord cutting... however we can clearly see VIAC is pivoting hard and aggressively, and is leveraging its legacy business into world class streaming services. Others will argue that VIAC is way behind, and they don’t stand a chance against the likes of Disney+ or Netflix.. and the streaming space is “crowded”.. how can they hope to capture significant market share... well, again, they are showing us and proving to us “how” they will... the real bear thesis is VIAC is an old, legacy boomer media “cable” stock, and that’s because they are only doing a surface gloss over, and not really digging in and seeing that it’s furthest from the case... I’d of stayed the hell away from it if I didn’t see the huge growth.. the value is only what got me on to it after the Archegos fallout, but it’s the growth and aggressive management that’s has me balls deep."

2021-05-09 22:03:33,wallstreetbets,"The way I understand it is delta is amount your option will increase in value in relation to price change in the underlying stock....a delta of 75 will increase 75 cents for every dollar the stock increases. A delta of 1 will be a 1:1 ratio, which is basically like owning the stock outright. Further out of the money options have lower delta meaning their value increase at a lower rate as the underlying stock increases in value, but their premiums are cheaper."

Stupid calls is an actual option strategy.

I think people thought the oc was calling op stupid and got mad.

A ""stupid"" is just buying calls and/or puts with different strikes and expirations."
2021-05-09 23:51:03,wallstreetbets,i believe it refers to initiating the positions in this manner.
2021-05-09 21:44:39,wallstreetbets,Now I'm the jackass 🤣 Ok
2021-05-10 00:53:43,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-05-10 00:21:24,wallstreetbets,"Spreading out your strikes and exp dates seems perfectly fine to me because of the following:

If you are targeting a stock that is not volatile and you expect it to stay in a given channel for a long time, you could buy calls for multiple dates with the same strike price to take advantage of that price action.

If you are targeting a growth stock and think it will keep climbing, you could easily plot your strikes and exp dates along your projected curve, since the closer you get to reality with your calls, the more profit you make.

In the previous example, you could also keep a steady strike and string out the exp dates to get some really juicy LEAPs out of it. The different exp windows also give you a lot more risk mitigation.

Thinking it over, the only options spreads that I'd call stupid would be different strikes, same exp, same date of purchase. 

&#x200B;

Hell I might be wrong on all of this, I'm retarded just like the rest of you."
2021-05-09 21:47:13,wallstreetbets,at least you nailed that one ;)
2021-05-10 00:25:06,wallstreetbets,"i think the idea is that if you knew the correct price at expiration you would select the option that would maximize your profit instead of using the shotgun approach.

2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$NOK DeeDee: Get Your Diamond Hands Off Me You Damn Dirty Ape$ Hey MouthBreathers, listen up. If you sold Nokia during the run-up then you just hate money. NOK got caught up in the GME saga and now the stock has a stink on it thanks to the mainstream media and others who don’t understand how a Short Squeeze works, and how GME went parabolic in one week. Let's keep in mind, there were some good and truthful DD posts on NOK in December/January, and some great fucking DD on Nok in the last couple months. I suspect it went from $4 to $9 just from the massive influx of new members checking out our old posts, trying to find an affordable seat on the Rocketship. No, Nokia doesn't have a ton of short interest. But I still really like the stock and I’d like to tell you why, and a little bit about our future re: John Titor

\>Let's not forget about when this wasn't ALL about fucking the shorts, jeezus christ.. NOK is different from that bullshit, because it truly has deep fucking value. And believe me, this goes DEEP.. They don't manufacture or sell phones anymore. The only connection they have in making and selling phones is the Nokia brand name being licensed out to a Taiwanese manufacturing company called HDM Global. Almost all the company's revenue comes from Wireless Network Infrastructure and Internet Routing Equipment. Let's go back and track this evolution --> In 2010 this only generated 30% of its revenue (Networking Products, Cellular Base Stations, etc) -- In 2020 this made them 85% of their revenue!! Nokia transformed itself into Wireless Technology Company you fucking retards!! They did this through a series of Autistic Acquisitions ""AA"" -- In April of 2011 they acquired the Wireless Network Infrastructure Assets of Motorola Solutions (this basically gave Nokia all of Motorola's 2G 3G 4G assets) --> In August of 2013 Nokia acquired Nokia/Siemens Network joint venture and renamed the division ""Nokia Networks"" and that same year Nokia sold its entire mobile phone division to Microsoft --> The in early 2016, Nokia agreed to acquire Alcatel-Lucent for $15.6 Billion which gave then all of their Wireless Technology, Routers, Switches, and Optical Tech within Alcatel as well as Bell Labs (formerly an Alcatel-Lucent division) -- This final deal gave Nokia the massive scale they have now to compete with the industry giants like Ericsson and Huawei head to fucking head (yeah.. this is real you idiots) And we know that Huawei is literally banned in multiple countries around the world soo... So where am I going with this, and why will they emerge as one of most important companies the near future?? \*\*REEFSHARK - AI DRIVEN 5G WIRELESS NETWORKS - NETWORK SLICING - AND THE POWER OF THE FUTURE\*\* Take an extra retard pill for the rest of this DD post, you're gonna need it. They have been building themselves up to this moment. ReefShark is the key here, 5G Network is the door, and AI Driven 5G Network Slicing is the living room of the future. Nokia has this proprietary chip that will play a big role in how 5G will be available. It will ease the load of 5G Network rollout because it has a 50%-%60 reduction in energy use, which is an outstanding selling point to the industries looking to tap into 5G bandwidth. It is the most efficient chip of its kind, by far, with the added benefit of boosting antenna performance. This efficiency is necessary to the way different industries and companies will utilize the 5G Network. They will go through MVNO (MOBILE VIRTUAL NETWORK OPERATOR) to basically rent out their 5G bandwidth from a cloud. This is called \*Network Slicing\* for all u chimps out there. For example, Tesla will rent out their own slice of dedicated 5G Bandwidth. More than 1,000 companies use MVNO already and most apes have not even heard of it yet. Here is how Nokia fits into all of this techy garbage: NOK IS ALREADY THE BIGGEST PLAYER IN THIS MARKET SPACE (they made up $4.5 billion of the $66.9 billion of ""Telecom Software and Services"" in 2019) AND \*REEFSHARK\* MAKES THEM THE UNCHALLENGED LEADER IN THIS EVERGROWING MARKET WITH AI POWERED NETWORK CAPABILITIES<

\*\*\*BONUS LEVEL\*\*\* Last year NASA selected Nokia's Bell Labs division to supply the 4G LTE communications network for the moon soon. No joke, the ACTUAL Moon, not emoji moon. Before the end of 2022, they will put a highly functioning 4G network on the lunar surface in preparation for the planned 2024 return mission to the Moon. Drop the crayons for a second and think about this... Ok now eat the red one (it's the same colors as your wife's butthole after her bf leaves your driveway in his big loud pickup truck) Your stupid little smooth brain is probably wondering what all this old 4G talk is about with all the 5G shit rolling out nationwide, changing the course of history... Answer--> the lunar surface is relatively flat so there won't be interference with the cheaper, more practical 4G network. We are talking about putting a mobile network into space you retards so stfu. The signal will travel further, it just makes more sense. They must start somewhere, though this will evolve into 5G up there eventually. \*\*NASA could've given this contract to anyone, but THEY CHOSE NOKIA because they believe in them!! They believe Nokia has the best performing Wireless Network Equipment.. So I like the fucking stock ok?!! --> Insert Rocket Emojis, Fire, Boom, Flags, all that shit right here <--

[Picture 1. My positions as of 05\/07\/2021.](https://preview.redd.it/fb99gqs6l6y61.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0a8817217f15de68a0f2d9819d59540c3210561)

[Picture 2. $INO is at a 52 week low and is bullish with 7 analyst average PT of $17 and high street target of $35.](https://preview.redd.it/7egn51j8l6y61.png?width=284&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0cc8020445533c9e45e20eb1c46380ca00839bd)

&#x200B;

I made [this post about Inovio and Regeneron’](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6q9v0/regeneron_rgen_is_rumored_to_be_buying_out_ino/gxfm6g5/?context=3)s joint patent for their GBM (brain cancer) drug and even followed up with their CFO and it looks like they are working on drugs together but did not hint at buyout. Then u/soggit took [over WSB with his deep dive into $INO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n70cim/my_first_dd_im_a_doctor_and_i_think_ino_is_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).

This upcoming week Inovio has a trifecta of positive catalysts that will potentially raise share price to $15-$17. From Fridays close this is a 2.5x gain on commons shares and probably 10-20x gain on call options.

The trifecta of bullish catalysts include:

1. [Completion of their Covid-19 phase II trial ](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256652v1)with excellent immune response. The INO-4800 vaccine does not require refrigeration, cheap to manufacture, and will be the number one vaccine for the 95% of the globe’s population that is yet to be vaccinated. Last month India was wrecked. Next week I suspect Nepal, Pakistan. The infection will probably circle back to China in the near future. They are racing against time for  a safe, effective vaccine that can go into the rural hinterland. INO-4800 DNA vaccine is the answer.  (Market size $2.5 Billion)
2. Joint Patent with [Regeneron ($REGN) for their GBM drug/therapeutic.](http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&r=523&f=G&l=50&d=PG01&s1=%22*%22&p=11&OS=) (Market size $400 million)
3. Success of their [phase III HPV Immunotherapy therapeutic VGX-3100](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inovio-announces-positive-results-from-reveal-1-a-phase-3-pivotal-trial-evaluating-vgx-3100-its-dna-based-hpv-immunotherapy-for-the-treatment-of-high-grade-precancerous-cervical-dysplasia-caused-by-hpv-16-andor-hpv-18-301237793.html)  (Market size $1.2 Billion)

**Bear Thesis**

1.25-30% short interest. Citadel of $GME fame has made over $100 million in profits in shorting $INO in 2021. Inovio doing well means bad news for Citadel and hopefully increase the upward pressure on $GME>

2.No product ever successfully commercialized. But remember this was the case for Moderna for their $MRNA vaccine. I suspect $INO is the Moderna of 2021 in terms of DNA vaccine.

3. There is [high short interest](https://fintel.io/ss/us/ino) which is driving the stock down which is very typical of late stage biotech.

Key Points:

\> INO-4800 induced robust T-cell response too all COVID-19 variants (including UK and Brazilian variants).

\> INO-4800 has the same effective powers in generating neutralizing antibodies similar to mRNA vaccines like Moderna.

\> Second generation Pan-COVID vaccine INO-4802 is being developed and is progressing well and upcoming pre-pub  coming out in the near future.

\> Immuno-oncology effort: novel combination trial with PD-1 inhibitor with Regeneron and Sanofi in newly diagnosed GBM is ongoing. The company anticipates sharing 24 month survival data and other data later this year

\> On their HPV trials they have meet their efficacy end points. This is for the management of HPV-16/18 induced malignancies. The findings/data will be shared later this year at scientific meeting. VGX-3100 biomarker will help find patients that potentially will respond to VGX-3100

\> VGX-3100 indications may expand to include anal dysplasia and vulvar dysplasia following further discussion with FDA

\> Financial summary for Q1 2021: Well positioned finally with total cash $111.6 MM. Net proceeds of 162 million from recent offering in february. They have multiple years of capital to support Inovio's many project. RV 371K for Q1. Total operating expnese 52 Million. Net loss for Q1 54.4 Million. Or 27 cents per share. R&D expense 32MM. HIgher drug manufacutring expenses related to INO-4800 and other trials. They also had increased expense from cellectra® 2000 device and new hire. These expenses have been essential for their INO-4800 trial for covid 19 and their cellectra® 2000 device. Overall Strong financial position.

\> On track with INO-4800 trial with phase III on track for this summer. This temperature stable vaccine will be important globally.

&#x200B;

Q/A Session:

\> Q1 - Jeff Mecham BoA:  How is the phase III INO-4800 clinical halt going? How does this relate to trial being done outside USA?

A1: Clinical hold on phase III for INO-4800 only impacts USA and not outside of USA. They still plan to open sites in USA but most of the trials will be global. They will apply with FDA during Q1 to lift the partial clinical hold hoping to start in Q2. The goal is global phase III trial and looking with external sources of funding. Not going to Ex-US for cost reasons but they have external links with some countries which do not have covid-19 vaccines and they can do randomized placebo control blinded trials there

&#x200B;

\> Q2 - Ellen -  Looks like you are targeting countries with active Covid-19 and without vaccines. Have you considered non-inferiority trials?

\> A2 - Case driven efficacy window is still open Ex-US.

&#x200B;

\> Q3 - Ellen - Planning on revealing INO-3107 data?

A3 - We received orphan drug designation last year for INO-3107 last year. The most impactful data will be released in 2022. Maybe some meaningful data later this year.

&#x200B;

\>Q4 -  Aydin Huseynov, M.D., CFA Benchmark - We see the data in the pre-publication. Can you commend on Geometric folding?

\>A4 -Antibody levels and impact on vaccine on rise on antibody is important. We feel INO-4800 is equally as good as current EUA approved vaccines in providing protection against COVID-19. Our phase 2 trial shows strong T-cell reponse. Furthermore, the T-cell responese mainted in respond to the new variants. This will be important in providing protection as per our phase III effacicy trial which will start later this summer.

Q5 - Can you see boosting with the INO-4800? What is the medium term view for this vaccine.

A5 - Many experts globally feel like COVID-19 vaccination will require annual seasonal boosting. If they are correct. A vaccine that can be boosted safely and tolerably seasonally over and over again will be important. After the pandemic we will have endemic COVID-XX which will require boosters and INO-4800 will be important to vaccinate people. They can also be used to boost other first generation vaccines that have already been used. INO-4802 is a further generation ahead and will be a pan-COVID vaccine.

&#x200B;

Q6 - E Chan from Wayne Right - Can you tell us if INovio is going to put some of their capital in global Covid-19 research.

A6 - We have over 500 million in cash right now and that is one of our strengths. We want to maintain that and limit our expenses. We are currently are in the process of working with external sources of funding to expand our INO-4800 trial in the US and globally. We are focusing on places where we feel Covid-19 vaccines are needed globally. We will have more information published in the next few weeks.

&#x200B;

Q7 -  Piper Sandler - Can you comment the neutralizing antibody response in comparison to convalence plasma. What gives you confidence the reaction from the investigators and subjects?

A7 - The geometric mean titer presented in the pre-pub shows excellent level of neutralizing antibodies. This is specially apparent for the 2 mg group. The confidence intervals are very strong.

Is #1 priced in after the DoD announcement?

2021-05-10 05:55:31,wallstreetbets,I’m of a mind to invest here. The cancer research seems solid too. Dipping my toes in 10-15k. Premiums seem inflated though. Shares might be the way to go. Earnings doesn’t look like anything good unless there’s guidance. Thoughts appreciated.

Should I panic that I was up $900 since open, and now I'm only up $500? 

Should I break out my 💎👐 t-shirts and start nervously mumbling to myself again? 

Should I dare bathing? Not bathing seemed to help a great deal when I rode GME pretty hard.

2021-05-10 01:43:11,wallstreetbets,"There is another HUGE catalyst you have not mentioned.

Recently, INOVIO in cooperation with [dwkulp@wistar.org](mailto:dwkulp@wistar.org) posted a preprint of their study highlighting adding nanoparticles to new vaccines developed with INOVIO to fight the variants of COVID-19.

In a nutshell, they developed vaccines that are more effective against COVID-19 variants than than vaccines that simply target the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus.

INOVIO has yet to announce their development of INO-4802 (the PAN-COVID vaccine), however based on this study INOVIO may be very close finishing designing their new vaccines for COVID-19 booster shots.  

This research appears to be very very promising...

Cellectra can be battery operated and is definitely cheaper than building a cold storage logistical solution for many countries. I'm actually excited they have a hardware platform and I think it's undervalued.

#1 - People in US act like COVID is over now. 95% of world needs vaccine. Asia, emerging countries, are a good fit for INO. And even US needs boosters too. So I think investors are chasing other opportunities on false belief that COVID is done.

#2 - check out OP original due diligence.

#3 - people were expecting COVID news the day VGX3100 news came out. Management was excited but news fell flat due to hopes for Phase 2 numbers instead. So I don't think it's priced in at all honestly."

This isn’t including the frequent brigading from r/inovio.

Edit: instead of responding to any criticism you’ll just get met with insults, or have your point suppressed with downvotes. Go to any INO thread, and sort by controversial.

2021-05-09 22:43:28,wallstreetbets,I provided the source above. Bloomberg article from two weeks ago. I hate Misinformaton. Let me know if there is an other information you want. Was on the floor taking care of a patient.
2021-05-10 00:38:04,wallstreetbets,"Saying the US Government dropped funding is falsely implying that the US GOV made a decision which is not what happened. 

A small piece of the military part of the government with a long term relationship funding phase 1 and 2 trials with Inovio doesn't see Covid-19 as a threat that necessitates the military running Inovio's ph. 3 trial for them anymore. Makes sense because Inovio is already trying to run the same trial for approval in China and elsewhere so the data can be shared meanwhile the threat from Covid is diminishing with other vaccine options in the US."
2021-05-10 05:40:28,wallstreetbets,I was talking about you 😂
2021-05-09 20:40:57,wallstreetbets,I would say sell if it gets to 35.

2021-05-09 21:22:31,wallstreetbets,"Happily! Would you like to hear the business, or the science side? I'm able to answer both."
2021-05-09 21:18:26,wallstreetbets,"Yea, in all of my time investing in biotech I have never encountered the same amount of hate from even remotely criticizing a company. I have only had **one** conversation with a reasonable INO holder, and I can even summon him. I don't care about karma. I like, and understand biotech so I invest in it. I only care about others being misguided into a company after being told that they'll cure cancer, or get bought out for a ridiculous sum of money. 

The MO is to pretty much post garbage, astroturf from their own sub:

- [This thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Inovio/comments/n8r33k/support_fellow_ino_brethren/)

- [Or this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/Inovio/comments/n7vfyj/support_the_guys/)


along with a few others, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Then downvote everyone who gives a negative opinion on it (sidenote: I'd love to hear your thoughts u/zjz, or /u/Memetron9000 on this). It's not hard to find them at all. Without fail anytime a post about INO on this sub there's always a flood of few month old accounts only saying positive things about the company, and almost exclusively post in /r/Inovio. I get that it's reddit. I post contrarian shit all the time. I don't care about downvotes. But, this is about making money. When someone posts a counterargument to mine I typically guild them because an investment thesis should be able to handle a modicum of criticism. Science downright requires it."

2021-05-09 21:30:19,wallstreetbets,"Dammit wish you would have said either business, or both lol. Give me a sec to do some research, sources, and construct an argument."
2021-05-09 23:10:25,wallstreetbets,"Ok. I responded to someone else that I will not post it tonight, but I can get started. I take a research-focused approach before making any claims, or putting money into something. This included reading sec filings, press release, and financial statements. What good is an argument with zero citations? It’s late where I’m at, and I have work in the morning."
2021-05-09 21:28:04,wallstreetbets,"Amen to that! Like biotech is a magnet for dumb money, and greedy individuals looking to make a buck off of them. I worked my ass of to earn my education, and I'm going to use it. The odds of a company actually making it from phase I to approval is small, but money always flies in on any remotely positive news. If you know the science it's free money. 

With that being said though there are actual companies that actually will make money. People are hesitant to invest in biotech because everyone has been burned by it at least once. I'd rather not have someone get turned off from biotech because they believed some idiot with an IQ similar to the temperature of lukewarm hotdog water told them that this will cure cancer resulting in them losing money."
2021-05-10 06:22:48,wallstreetbets,"Hey, so I have a personal policy of not having an opinion on a company if I haven’t done the research on both the science, and business side. This takes quite a bit of time. Is there any reason I should check them out? Not being a bitch. I put in about 40-120 hours into research, and I work full time. I"
2021-05-09 23:12:19,wallstreetbets,Looking forward.
2021-05-10 12:45:49,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, didn't know you spent so much time on these. Feel free to ignore if you think they're not worth doing research on. I thought Heat Biologics was interesting because back in February they announced that adding their experimental drug to Bristol Myers Squibb's Opdivo helped lung-cancer patients have higher survival rates. Seemed promising but the stock has tumbled over the last 5 years though. Plenty of cash on hand. As for NVTA, they're big on testing for genetic disorders. Seems like a field with a lot of potential growth in the future. It's in one of the ARK funds, not sure if that's good or bad."

2021-05-10 03:31:42,wallstreetbets,"lol I thought it was pretty funny but I think the equivalency would be Netflix or Amazon if we are being fair here. 

Mail in DVDs and book sales. Both pivoted successfully into different business models after seeing the writing on the wall. If blockbuster got new activist management, instead of renting moved into streaming ala Netflix they would've been successful. 

Sears? 

I know this was a joke but I really don't see how GME doesn't end up successful. Stock price? Let's say they manage just to get their marketcap to match CHWY at $40bn~ that's a $600 no squeeze. Let's say it takes them 2-4yrs to do so. That's a magnificent return again, with no squeeze. 

Along the way though there will be many squeezes like TSLA. 

Not financial advice but I mean, DFV bought 50,000 more shares at $155 in his last post. To me? That shows me he is not selling anytime soon. Everyone I'm sure is jerking their dicks thinking he did that ""too sell and not be hated"" but the man just spent $7.5m to buy those shares. He is not going anywhere and at this point I doubt many are and not because ""hurr DURR they all bought at $400"".

Have you *really* thought about it though? It's easy to just say 'lol be chewy', but easier said than done, and what exactly does it mean when it comes to video games?  Shipping physical games isn't gonna cut it, not with the move to digital.  And before you say something like you prefer physical copies, reddit was full of people saying the same about Bluray. Bluray isn't exactly a failure, but it did fail to live up to expectations, and third party retailers that specialize in selling/renting physical copies were decimated.    

Digital distribution?  Good luck getting control of that from Microsoft/Sony/Nintendo.    Gaming is the worst space to be in for third party distribution.    

Merch? Cool.  PC hardware?  Ok, cool.  Chewy has recurring business at least, people don't buy new motherboards or keyboards every month, and it's also a super saturated market they're late to by 15 years.  That's a lot of catching up to do.  

What else do people usually bring up, LAN centers?  Not very popular in the US.  Esports what?    

Gamestopo doesn't create, innovate, invent, nothing. They're yet another third party retailer in a sea of *very* well established competition. I'm not saying it's game over, but there's definitely tons ways they can be unsuccessful, at least relative to shareholder expectations."

Will having movies available to stream that are still in theaters reduce ticket sales? Most likely. There are definitely movies that are just as good or better in the comfort of your own home, and there are people who don't care at all for the theater experience because the cons (loud people, sticky floors, concession prices, can't pause the movie, etc) outweigh the pros for them.

2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Fundamental & Comps Analysis for VZ, T, and TMUS. Fair value estimates included. **Model**: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mf3adRWo5YyW5l56TLDG0ZvZ7GfEeNv7oGc3kG50JAk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mf3adRWo5YyW5l56TLDG0ZvZ7GfEeNv7oGc3kG50JAk/edit?usp=sharing)

**Methodology**:

* Created a three-statement model for Verizon Communications., AT&T., and T-mobile US
* Combined this model with a WACC build-up to create an unlevered DCF and derived a fair-value-per-share estimate using a growth in perpetuity and an exit EBITDA multiple approach
* Spread comparable companies (these 3 + CHTR, T.TO, and BCE.TO)
* Combined results from DCF and select comps valuations to arrive at final estimates

**How to use the model**

* Anywhere you see blue text is OK to edit, and should not result in breaking anything. Green text = taken from another worksheet, so if you want to change one of those cells I recommend following the trail first
* To make meaningful changes to the 3-statement-model, scroll to the bottom of each ""Financials"" page to tweak assumptions about revenue growth, GPM, and other assumptions. You can also adjust the specifics for each case scenario from here
* I have tried to supply pessimistic assumptions about terminal growth rates and exit EBITDA multiples in the DCF models. Feel free to adjust C43 and H43 as needed, keeping in mind the model is very sensitive to these inputs
* WACC buildup can be done however you want. If you have access to a Bloomberg terminal you can get a better adjusted beta than I used, and a more precise cost of debt (more on that below), or you can just use the override cell to put in a WACC% directly
* Trading Comps Input essentially works to arrive at normalized multiples before converting to an output. Do not be intimidated by non-Gaap disclosures. Everything here is available on annual reports, quarterly reports, and press releases.
* For trading comps outputs, simply toggle the companies in column B until you have the company you wish to analyze in the first position, and the other comps below it, then head to Valuation Matrix to see the results.
* Feel free to adjust the assumptions, there are a lot of them
* If you can think of an assumption better than something I have here, or if you spot a mistake let me know!

**Other Notes:**

* I Imported the model from excel to Google Sheets before sharing --> if something is broken, let me know so I can go in and fix it
* Of particular note in the comps spread is Charter Communications options outstanding. They provide a dollar figure, so I worked backwards to arrive at the correct value for Gross proceeds from exercise of options
* Rogers Communications would have been included in the comps analysis, but I felt the pending merger would skew multiples beyond what could realistically be compared with the US big 3. I should probably include Vodafone but I was so excited to share! Maybe if you check back in I'll have added it :)
* Used 10Y YTM bond data on FINRA to arrive at assumptions for cost-of-debt used in WACC build-up. If you have access to a bloomberg terminal you can grab the bond with the best volume and use that.
* I have my own opinions about the intangibles of these companies (management, forward looking results of the recent spectrum auction etc.) but I feel that if people want to chat about those things the comment section would be a better place to do it!
* I apologize for ambiguity (especially on the non-gaap stuff) but I couldn't figure out how to remove my name from the comments quickly (if you know how to do this, other than going one-by-one through each comment, let me know and I'll reupload). Most comments were simply memos to myself to remember what each cell consists of beyond the label (i.e., components of ""other current assets"")
* A thousand more things. If you want to know just ask.

**None of this is financial advice. This is an exercise I did for my own use and thought this sub might find it entertaining.**  
**Do your own Due Diligence.**  
**I own VZ stock.**

**T** in contrast is calculated to be lower, but the market and insiders heavily disagree, it's up **+11,82% year to date** and insiders are buying the stock. Even the Warner Media CEO, Jason Kilar, recently increased his stake in AT&T by buying more stock. How would that make sense?

* Requires a large number of assumptions
* Prone to errors
* Prone to overcomplexity
* Very sensitive to changes in assumptions
* A high level of detail may result in overconfidence
* Looks at [company valuation](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/valuation-methods/) in isolation
* Doesn’t look at relative valuations of competitors
* [Terminal value](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/terminal-value/) is hard to estimate and represents a large portion of the total value

\- It's not 'literally' meaningless, you might say that it should be weighted less, but to say that it's 'literally' meaningless is just false.

"" Insider buying can be useful because it shows confidence."" - How can you claim that selling is 'literally meaningless' while buying is meaningful, the one is the inverse of the other!? When they are not only not buying, but also \*massively\* selling, how could that not have any significance, that's just nonsensical.

""And how do you value a stock if you think DCF is some meaningless model where arbitrarily chosen numbers are inputted?""

\- Can you quote the part where I classified DCF as 'meaningless'? You can't, don't put words in my mouth. I stated that DCF, as any mathematical model, is flawed to some degree, that's why one should consider a diverse set of factors and projections to make investment decisons.

Really bulled up on this one, picked up 20 of the calls in your post and put 100k into leaps today. Easy $350 stock by 2023."
2021-05-10 14:10:02,wallstreetbets,Well as long as you believe there isn’t much to cry about until after they expire
2021-05-10 17:28:19,wallstreetbets,This is the way. If you don't drive a lambo then why drive?
2021-05-09 21:42:09,wallstreetbets,Lost a few thousand on Luckin Coffee (LK). They got delisted by the Feds. I stay away from Chinese stocks now. You never know with Chinese companies.

2021-05-10 05:56:17,wallstreetbets,"Try to diversify what you invest. It is too risky just put everything in 1. Anyway, it is a fact that BABA is so undervalued. From my point of view, the price should be between $250-$285. Probably, the market is discounting the fine BABA will receive from Chinese government."
2021-05-10 06:26:10,wallstreetbets,rub your oil lamp harder!
2021-05-10 08:45:28,wallstreetbets,Price increase on earnings?  What is this?  1983?

2021-05-10 13:55:27,wallstreetbets,I bought 50 BABA @ 84.48. Watched it go up to $300+. Sold for a 175% gain when it started selling off. Bought 500 NIO @ $4.86. Watched it spool up 1000%. Sold it for 800% gain when it started selling off.
2021-05-10 15:47:53,wallstreetbets,I lost 83% of my portfolio. Made educated gambles on trades but meme culture made it behave the opposite lol
2021-05-10 18:53:07,wallstreetbets,Requesting update after that -2.89% you took today
2021-05-10 19:49:55,wallstreetbets,Never bet on earnings
2021-05-09 21:35:08,wallstreetbets,"Based on the Fibonacci extension on the 15 minute chart there is a possibility of $249/share by the time this calls expire, but I'd say sell cause you clearly need the money too badly to make it to that profit. Are you willing to risk it all for a possible 3x?"
2021-05-10 09:38:52,wallstreetbets,"BABA was $324, no reason not to go back there"
2021-05-09 20:03:17,wallstreetbets,Gonna see how this turns out

2021-05-09 20:23:19,wallstreetbets,You’re crazy for putting everything in a call option then. That’s wayyy too risky
2021-05-09 20:41:27,wallstreetbets,Probably don’t invest all your money on a WSB stock

2021-05-10 05:30:31,wallstreetbets,"You haven’t done your research because there’s a lot of reputable people calling the company a fraud. Also, earnings are priced in and Chinese earnings aren’t even considered. There’s literally no way to tell the legitimacy of their earnings numbers. 

However, it does have potential around it and I’m not calling it a fraud, but I certainly wouldn’t have put all my eggs in that bag.

Should just bought 1 year calls in companies like NCLH and other companies that were hurt bad by COVID that are still below their pre COVID numbers, which isn’t a lot of companies tbh. Seems like almost everyone is way above their pre COVID numbers somehow. It’s unbelievable how expensive some mundane stocks are, like Zoom."
2021-05-10 05:35:48,wallstreetbets,"well, you were greedy. You could have just bought stocks instead. Worst case scenario you can wait it out. Now time is not on your side..."

2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Mega Move Incoming For WELL Health $WELL $WLYYF OK so after seeing the fundamentals were pretty sound: 

1. Earnings out earlier than scheduled which is very bullish
2. They   just did a $305M raise priced at a 25% premium to market which was led   by Mr Li Ka Shing (29th richest man in the world) who put up $105M of   his own money
3. Completed   the CRH Medical acquisition which analysts anticipate will bring the   company to over $300M in revenue and $50M in free cash flow.
4. JP Morgan the largest healthcare bank in the US extended the CRH credit line from $200M to $300M
5. 0 debt on the balance sheet and $80M in the bank after the recent financing
6. What looks like a partnership with Apple? They are now the first Canadian company to offer EMR records on Iphone.
7. They have historically beat earnings guidance and I think could do the same here given how strong of a close they had on Friday.

&#x200B;

I decided to take it one step further and dive into the charts. Canadian company so I'm going with the Canadian ticker ""WELL"" as it seems to get most of the action. 

I like to start my TA by zooming out to the maximum relevant period for any story. This last year given the pandemic seems like the most logical time frame for this... The stock performed exceptionally well throughout the pandemic and is now finding itself consolidating in the $7 range. 

Now the key for me is that within this consolidation period the company has made immense progress as I stated above. This is an entirely new story , management was able to use their operational skills and really take advantage of this situation. 

1. They raised an additional $305M led by the 29th richest man in the world who has invested in every single round to date... This one priced at a 25% premium. 
2. They used that capital to acquire CRH Medical which is going to bring revenues to $300M and free cash flow to $50M 
3. They acquired Circle Medical - a leading silicon valley company which is going to allow them to compete with any US Healthcare company. 
4. They are now the first Canadian healthcare company to directly integrate into Iphone. 
5. and still they have 0 debt and what I calculated to almost $80M in cash... 

To put it simply - they are on a hot M&A streak and doing it very very well (no pun intended lol). 

SO this is where it gets interesting for me - If we zoom out a year to the point they last started bolstering up M&A activity around March/April we see WELL is sitting clean on its 200day SMA before making a monster move for the better half of the year. 

Now this is where they stood apart... Unlike other companies who experienced monstrous returns over the year and didn't focus on the operational aspect (Cough cough CLOV) WELL was able to use this time to focus on operations and exponentially increase its revenue, brands, cashflows, and ultimately justify its stock price up here. 

Now here is where the TA comes in... A year ago they were sitting flush on the 200 Day SMA right as they started increasing M&A Activity... Now again, after making hugely successful acquisitions with CRH, Circle, etc while in this consolidation period WELL is again sitting clean on its 200day SMA and has double bottomed with a higher low and  is further shown with the RSI being oversold and coiled in the right direction. .. There is also a massive Bull Flag forming... Further suggesting a huge breakout

[1Year\/Daily \(200day SMA confluences\) ](https://preview.redd.it/rloh016ij5y61.png?width=2874&format=png&auto=webp&s=b480d9d3d67d44c2c757dd4234ed8803d9072309)

Now obviously one time frame doesn't tell the whole story so I went deeper. 

Right, 6 month/Daily shows the same thing - Massive consolidation - Bull flag - Higher low - and a clean on its 200 day SMA. 

[6Month\/Daily - Higher low - Bull flag - Double bottom.](https://preview.redd.it/wejhg81hn5y61.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=79e205d5e494309bc55812d0a8a74f2210136d02)

10 day/Hourly - WELL Closed on strong volume right below its 50 day SMA - The last time was on 04/23 when it closed just below its 20 day SMA on strong volume and proceeded to move 10% + (Caused by a failed short report). 

[10 days\/Hourly](https://preview.redd.it/bzzwkfayn5y61.png?width=2874&format=png&auto=webp&s=a81147d55aaa39ab985e6b88a0323d5be4ed0601)

So that led me to look at the volume... Which we see is roughly double the week prior. 

&#x200B;

[Volume Increase 04\/09 - 05\/07 ](https://preview.redd.it/0d1flpjho5y61.png?width=2482&format=png&auto=webp&s=573ba72ecbdc124b99ebddf9f92860e17c6fd40b)

Analysts are expecting record earnings Tuesday so that's more than likely the cause. 

Now that brings me to my final question? Where can this go? 

On a short term we see an inverse H&S and a next resistance at 7.18 (Likely opens above that I think) 

https://preview.redd.it/vffo46n3p5y61.png?width=2860&format=png&auto=webp&s=256fa9d69a481aacc997a97dd96fe378a0894415

Now this 7.18 level is key to break so the next stop would be 7.80 as we see here (+10%) 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2oktpnxep5y61.png?width=2872&format=png&auto=webp&s=509a680d5f995a9009e64078c057aec47b500404

Once that 7.80 level is reached which I believe earnings will help us achieve then we need to zoom out again and look at where this really could go... The answer to that is obviously subjective based on what happens in the business but I think as they are exponentially increasing the value of their core business via M&A activity the very same thing could happen with the stock. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/snwojxnzp5y61.png?width=2634&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a929096195ed04fb7402f0879c6e964fff8f345

I believe if earnings are positive that WELL could break out of this $7-$9 consolidation zone and find itself trading in a new zone, likely blue skies somewhere in the teens or 20s. 

I really have conviction in this because they just raised $305M priced at a 25% premium to market at the time ($9.80) which the 29th richest man in the world put up $105M of... 

Now the question is to load up before earnings or watch and see what happens but potentially miss out on this move."

2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A quantitative observation of stock selling activities and corresponding timeframe by CEOs and insiders of successful tech companies. Both IPO and Direct Listed companies I knew that when I posted that DD on $PLTR CEO heavily selling stocks within six months of going public will be challenged strongly but I had no idea about the intensity. The comment section in that post is just sad and a true reflection of the state of the desperation from so many bag holders. They are trying so hard to defend these heavy selling of $PLTR shares by the CEO by weak and laughable logic. You really want to talk about the insider selling? Let’s see what other CEO of successful company did-

**Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos**

Company went public in 1997

stock price was $1.73 at that time.

Bezos sold his 1st batch of shares in 2003, six years after his company went public.

He sold 2.95M shares at price range $28-$49

He did not sell any shares in 1999 when the stock was trading at its ATH of $107

When he sold his 1st share it was over 2800% up from its IPO price

&#x200B;

**Former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates**

Company went public in 1986

stock price was $0.11 at that time.

Gates sold his 1st batch of shares in 2003, seventeen years after his company went public.

He sold 22M shares at price range $25-$26

He did not sell any shares in 1999 when the stock was trading at its ATH of $56

When he sold his 1st share it was over 23000% up from its IPO price

&#x200B;

**Tesla CEO Elon Musk**

Company went public in 2010

stock price was $3.84 at that time.

Musk sold his 1st batch of shares in 2010, the same year his company went public.

He sold only 1.41M shares at $3.4

And then he bought back those 1.41M shares in 2011 at $5.75 (paid more than he got from selling them)

After that in 2012 he purchased

1.87M shares at $1.6

35.3K shares at $5.65

88.9K shares at $2.22

In 2013 he purchased

1.08M shares at $18.44

214K shares at $9.3

Then he kept buying shares in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 at even higher price. In 2020 he even purchased 13K shares at $767

He did not sell any shares even when TSLA was trading at $900

The only other time he sold 2.78M shares in 2016 at $42.6

***Now go and look at what Steve Jobs and other CEOs did, you will be very surprised.***

&#x200B;

**CEOs and insiders of other Direct listing companies**

What about **directly listed stocks?** Let’s see-

**$SPOT:** It has been 3 years they went public. No insiders sold a single share till today except Direct TV sold their shares.

**$WORK:** ~~Almost 2 years since they went public. No insiders sold a single share till today.~~ CEO sold about 1.8M shares at different price. First sold 125K shares on 06/08/2020 at $30-$32 one year after company went public

**$RBLX:** CEO David Baszucki sold only 1.3M shares at 67.77

**$COIN:** ~~No insiders sold a single share till today.~~ CEO has not sold any share yet. (Thanks to u/aahsir for pointing this mistake)

People kept saying Alex Karp did not sell much or he needs to pay tax on the options he has been exercising. He got 141M shares from options with an exercise price of $11.38 and these options will expire on August 20, 2032 that is more than 11 years from today. None of these 141M shares are even vested yet. Only 2.5% (3.525M) shares will be vested in August 2021. Now tell me what is so hurry that he kept exercising those options and selling these shares when these options are not expiring in next 10 years?

You do not pay tax on these options until you exercise them. Even if you exercise them you pay only capital gain tax on the profit you make from the difference between the FMV and exercise price. CEOs do not just exercise their options they get from their stock-based compensation 11 years before the options expires. Even if they do, they do not just sell them immediately when the company is still bleeding money and cash negative. You only exercise these options if you think that there is little to no benefit of keeping these options for long time and you can get more money if you exercise them now, even after paying the tax on it.

Some people are saying Karp only getting 1M in salary. Oh boy! You have no idea why a CEO take cash salary less than 1M and take options and stocks worth billion. Karp is taking only 1M salary, but his total compensation is over 1B. That means he is taking a salary in cash that is less than 0.1% of his total compensation. Do you know why? Because that’s the maximum cap that you can deduct fully from your expenses. If his expense is 3M in 2021, he will basically pay $0 income tax on his cash salary. But if his cash salary was 2M and his expenses were 3M then he can deduct only 1M expense but still need to pay income tax on his rest 1M cash salary.

Now if he thinks that $PLTR will be $50 by let’s say Feb 2022, why would he exercise those options now and sell those stocks at $20? Think more and please let me know.

Some people were saying it’s his stocks and it doesn’t matter what he does with his stock. Seriously? You know, this is why people, both from other finance related subs and we ourselves, call us retards. Sometimes it might seem funny but it’s not.

And please do not say that it's a long term investment because people invest on a stock keeping years timeframe in mind do not spend time discussing their investment strategies here. Even when people post showing gains from stock they are being mocked heavily although I dot agree with that kind of feedback. wsb is anything but a long term investment sub. Now some people do pretend to become one when they are left holding bags on a meme stock like PLTR. All these might sound bitter to you who bought PLTR at $35 or even at $40 but that's the truth.

&#x200B;

**TlDr:** What the CEO of $PLTR has been doing in terms of dumping shares is completely opposite of what other CEOs did in past and it’s a big red alert.

I do like Palantir Technologies as a company and I believe that with careful implementation of good business strategies they might become a very successful tech company. But, I do not like $PLTR stock for many reasons such as heavy insider selling, compensation structure of the company top executives and most importantly due to their direct listing. If you observe the price action of other directly listed tickers such as $SPOT and $WORK you will have an idea.

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Based on few comments, looks like **I was probably wrong on the tax implication of the options granted** as part of stock based compensation. I need to read more on that specific topic.

I am still bearish as other CEO did not sell that much stocks that soon that frequently. Tax implication was just one point and I was wrong on that one, I agree. But, **stock options as part of a compensation are not subject to 1 million cap and can be deducted 100% value of those options**. In fact this is one reason CEOs take less salary (subject to 1M cap), less bonuses (subject to 1M cap), less RSUs(subject to 1M cap) and more stock options."
2021-05-10 13:16:48,wallstreetbets,"As a long-term bagholder of PLTR, I agree with you. I am a fan of this company, but Karp is a sham and I really, really wish I did not enter this position. Now that I am stuck for probably 10+ years for a payoff (because I love the long-term), I am no longer paying attention to this short-ter POS or it's greedy insiders.

&#x200B;

I remember his ""tax"" excuse 40 sell-orders ago. One of his orders a few weeks back was 20+million, well after his taxes were covered. Can't stand him, personally. He might as well just dump them all at this rate, and let PLTR take the hit and resume normal growth.

&#x200B;

As long as Karp has tons of shares, PLTR will never grow, because a 200,000 share Karp sell will hit on every single green day and spook investors further."
2021-05-09 23:28:21,wallstreetbets,I hope Karp will prove op wrong. Insider selling - a votenof confidence

2021-05-10 14:06:59,wallstreetbets,"You are incorrect regarding capital gains treatment and stock options for executives. They are compensation, so they receive ordinary income tax treatment on the difference between exercise price and fair market value at the time of vesting. The smart tax approach is to make an 83(b) election immediately upon receiving the stock option, paying the tax as if it vested then (even though it doesn’t). Then upon the actual vesting, there is no additional ordinary income tax as it was already paid at the time of the 83(b) election. When the executive later sells the stock, they will simply pay the applicable long-term or short-term capital gain rate. This is how it is almost always done."
2021-05-09 21:00:35,wallstreetbets,Direct listings are insiders selling. That's the difference from that and an ipo.
2021-05-09 23:28:04,wallstreetbets,"Another wrinkle on motives regarding taxable income are the coming increases.
Better to cash in this year at this years capital gains tax rate than the four ( + maybe)  years after.

2021-05-09 22:44:04,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the analysis. The point is well taken. The time before selling their first shares is important to see how much belief they had in their companies at the time. 

But the past time is irrelevant when considering evidence of the CEOs believing in their companies going forward. Karp has been systematically selling a good chunk of his shares. The last sale reported on May 6. Unless he owes millions to somebody or has to sustain a lavish life at the cost of future gains, it just doesn't make sense. If you believe that your company will be worth way more in the future, why lock meager gains in the present? 

The company is relevant and I'm sure they'll do well, but not at the levels people here want it to be. It just doesn't add up. They are not in the mass market business."

2021-05-09 20:17:13,wallstreetbets,"I understand that he has to pay his taxes so as any other CEO. My point was that he has been selling unusually high amount compare to other CEOs.

Tesla CEO is one of the top wealthy person in the world. Most of his wealth came from equity based compensations. Don't you think he also needs to pay taxes? way more than Karp? He barely sold any stocks so far. That was the whole point.

I am not spreading any misinformation. All these numbers I quoted are taken from SEC filings. There were some unintentional mistakes that I corrected promptly.

People write DD here, I saw a lot of pnd DD as well. People can take bullish side or bearish side on any company based on his or her research and observation. If someone writes a positive DD about a company, I don't go there and tell them ""just invest in the company why are you spreading misinformation or why are you pumping it"". I am not advising anyone to buy puts because I think it will go lower or sideways. I even told someone that playing options with this ticker, both calls and puts are bad idea imo."

""well there is no guaranty that that lung cancer was caused by smoking to Mr. XYZ, I know someone got lung cancer he never smoked, his name is Walter White"" kind of logic.

I pointed out some findings all based on SEC filing but not a single comment refuted those based on a logic other than their emotion. That's the nature of the mind when you are left alone holding bag and hope is the only thing you have."
2021-05-09 21:12:10,wallstreetbets,"Because he will owe over $500,000,000. You have a conclusion and you’re drawing the lines to get there."
2021-05-09 23:26:11,wallstreetbets,"Major part of your comment history is either arguing with people about how great PLTR is and how Salesforce is a bad product, how Tableau is a garbage product etc. How PLTR is awesome because they have partnership with AWS and IBM. Seriously? go check how many companies have partnership with AWS that you never even heard of. It's like someone selling something in Amazon and telling people he has a partnership with Amazon. And how are you getting this random number that he will need to pay over $500,000,000? Did he tell you that or did you ever see his tax filling? Based on the vesting schedule of 2.5% per quarter there will be a total of 10.95M stocks from options and RSUs combined by the end of this year that he might need to pay tax on. Overestimating the average price per share at $23 will results in a net compensation from these equities at $251M. Even if he pay full 40% tax on that compensation that will be 100M at max which is fully deductible against expenses. 

You have a conclusion based on your hope that Palantir will do good on some days so that you can offload your large bag and that's why you keep arguing with random stranger all over the reddit for Palantir. 

Hope is good but delusion is a prime cause for bag holder. Delusion like justifying premature selling of large quantity share by a CEO within six of going public when the company is still bleeding money by saying he will need to pay tax as if he is the only CEO in this tech world who pays tax and no one else pay anything. The whole world knows how unfair the tax rule is for CEOs compare to mass population where the CEOs can completely write of the whole tax liability from the performance based stock compensation which is the major part of their overall package. 

Get out of your delusion."

🤣🤣🤣 This was absolutely brilliant. Look at he chart of $PLTR, you ultra moron! Most people are bullish on PLTR here then why has it been falling down and down and down for straight 3 months? I never saw any negative post about the $PLTR here. All DD was about how revolutionary the company is, how they are ahead of every other data and AI companies by decades etc. Tell me after all those positive DD why it kept falling?

And now when I wrote a couple DD post quoting numbers from publicly available sources it became a market fraud!

2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm buying WY and so should you. Have you ever wanted to invest an an asset where it's *not* already priced in? **Wyoming**.

Wyoming is comprised of just under 65MM acres, with an average price of $600/acre. That works out to a market cap of approximately $45B, *but* you don't even need to purchase the entire state, or even half of it to own it outright. The Federal Government already owns 48.19% of the land in Wyoming in one form or another, and they have little to no interest in its internal affairs. That reduces the total capital necessary to own all *available* land to only $22B. Now consider that an additional 3MM acres are Indian Reservations (which are their own entities, legally) and you can reduce the price by another $2BB, leaving us with a sticker price of $20B to own the entire state of Wyoming. With 10MM ~~apes~~ jackalopes, that works out to just $2,000 per jackalope (or $1,000 if we just want to take a controlling interest) and we can have our own WSB Polity.

This is a great opportunity for us as ground floor investors. WY has no personal or corporate income taxes and some of the lowest property tax rates in the country. Combine that with one of the lowest costs of living as well. If we purchase the state and live there as well (paying minimal rent to a newly formed REIT, which we can get back in the form of dividends) it's basically living for free, eat your heart out FIREtards. Your FD budget just grew in size by your current rent payment, or spend the savings on that pair of Grand Tetons you've always wanted to help with your gender dysphoria. You're welcome. 

Given that Wyoming has a GDP of $35B, it has gross revenues 75% *greater* than its equity value. Currently the state is only able to capitalize on $2B of that via taxation, but I have a better idea. Using TSLA's *minimum* P/E for the last few years of 550 as a benchmark, we get a price target of nearly $20T or over $1MM per acre. -an order of magnitude greater than pitiful little companies like AAPL, who have a market cap of a measly $2T. If we take shares of WY public I estimate we could *easily* see an ROI of 500x. Asset classes can be based on the primary use of the land. Common shares can be rangeland, the least valuable, with arable farmland comprising A and B classes (irrigated and non-irrigated, respectively), and residential/commercially zoned acreage making up preferred shares.

But, aren't there already people heavily invested in Wyoming? Well, the current population isn't even 600,000 people, so we already outnumber them over 15:1, and that's not taking into account that statistically speaking, *some of us are already in the trade*. If we're quick about it, the level of buying pressure we would generate can only be good for us, since Real Estate takes more time to respond changes in demand. Shortly after we snap up the available land *it will have substantially appreciated in value due to market forces alone*.

In conclusion, buy WY. The state. Buy it all. It's cheap AF, but if all 10MM of us work together we can squeeze the shit out of it, have a 500 bagger, and set up shop in a place where we'll never have to worry about the cost of reloading our accounts again!

So I googles lumber stocks, and it came up and I bought a bunch of calls and cheap ass LEAPS.  Did the same thing with VMC.

Turns out WY is a REIT or REITish.  And you usually avoid that shit like the plague.  Just poorly managed 1031 capital usually.  But whateves, shits been green!"

2021-05-09 20:00:11,wallstreetbets,I worked for this god awful company for 2 years and hated every second of it but they are all about their money. They got approved last year to build a brand new mill in louisiana. They profit a good couple of million a week. Could definitely see this one popping off

2021-05-10 00:38:07,wallstreetbets,Doesn't Ted Turner already own like half of Wyoming?
2021-05-10 01:26:42,wallstreetbets,Weyerhaeuser is actually a good play right now. It has room to grow too. They’re a good large cap lumber and landowner which hedges inflation. I have had between 10-40% of my portfolio in them since December.
2021-05-10 01:55:34,wallstreetbets,Instructions unclear - execute command Buy $WY

2021-05-09 20:50:34,wallstreetbets,My parents owned a ton of land and just left it in CRP. More than covered the property taxes so it was just chilling.
2021-05-10 00:14:52,wallstreetbets,"so its like selling calls against ur shares, or lending em out to be shorted."
2021-05-10 12:13:11,wallstreetbets,that's a pretty batty mistake
2021-05-10 06:33:46,wallstreetbets,I got Weyland-Yutani.
2021-05-10 05:58:04,wallstreetbets,"> I mean WY can't just produce more land and dilute us landholders in case of squeeze...

They could pull some tricks like saying you no longer own any mining rights on your property."
2021-05-10 06:11:50,wallstreetbets,"Bro, Yellowstone is a giant volcano that could blow anytime spewing tons of new land out. Would destroy any squeeze. Honestly this is just a long value investment in an undervalued security."

2021-05-09 23:55:02,wallstreetbets,"Least we could do is motivate WSB apes to buy the land, then give it back to the Tribes.  Why the hell not."
2021-05-09 21:04:04,wallstreetbets,Did you look for WY? I already put in my buy order!
2021-05-09 21:25:53,wallstreetbets,Who's going to stop us?

2021-05-09 22:43:37,wallstreetbets,Is it 100% risky free?
2021-05-09 23:26:42,wallstreetbets,"So that's what I read online. That's an average, though, and it's taking into account all the worthless bush."
2021-05-10 14:17:53,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, water rights are sold separately"
2021-05-09 23:25:58,wallstreetbets,It was put on the 2020 or 2021 legislative session. Voted down. But it’s gonna gain traction if we don’t get revenue back and fast. Likely alongside an increase in sales tax
2021-05-09 23:04:34,wallstreetbets,My guess is lumber costs keep rising. How did you manage to lose money on lumber?
2021-05-09 23:47:14,wallstreetbets,Dude WY is a company that sells wood products. They own forest land in the North west from where they cut wood
2021-05-09 23:06:04,wallstreetbets,Not much going on there he came into town and spent some money had big plans now most of his properties are vacant in town and all the big plans for his ranch amphitheater are gone he chased all the contractors out and alot of people got burned. I worked on his ranch the company I work for did all the earthmoving and new pipelines
2021-05-09 23:09:54,wallstreetbets,Good man
2021-05-09 22:20:34,wallstreetbets,"Nope, it's WY. You don't read too good, do you."
2021-05-09 23:19:53,wallstreetbets,"It’s like 6,000 feet above sea level! It’s already up! But good luck finding shit to do outside of Yellowstone. Forget bullish/bearish it’s borish AF.

2021-05-10 01:03:50,wallstreetbets,"its actually a great place for outdoors stuff, yellow stone is probably the most beautiful place in the world when it isnt full of tourists. And they have a natural monument to woman called ""crazy woman canyon"" its actually a pretty creek and canyon."
2021-05-10 15:42:23,wallstreetbets,DUI capital of the country
2021-05-10 00:13:53,wallstreetbets,you son of a bitch. Im in!
2021-05-10 09:30:08,wallstreetbets,Honestly that’s how Vegas started watch Bugsy the movie
2021-05-09 21:22:26,wallstreetbets,"That is how it’s done.

Edit: when CRP payments or income from leasing ag land to tenant farmers covers property taxes, the local expression is that the farm is able to “wipe its own ass”"
2021-05-09 22:07:01,wallstreetbets,What's crp? You get paid for owning land?
2021-05-10 07:52:20,wallstreetbets,"Good luck, Colorado has natural defenses. Your plan will fail when you end up so high you forget the name of the state and end up invading Kansas."
2021-05-09 22:36:38,wallstreetbets,"Idk man, those drugged out hippies are tight with the rednecks and honestly they own a lot of guns themselves."
2021-05-10 00:40:53,wallstreetbets,So Wyoming is a potential Cannabis play? Should do well under Biden. Buy Buy Buy.
2021-05-10 07:55:56,wallstreetbets,And wind. They have a shit ton of that.
2021-05-09 22:46:26,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for that disclaimer. I've been playing $WOOD for a few weeks and making a killing. Someone told me to consider $WY instead since they move faster. 
I'm sticking to $WOOD."
2021-05-09 23:26:38,wallstreetbets,"Dude I am an Architect and I spec WY trusses lvls and other lumber products all the time. FYI , in the southwest there is a single family and multi family boom"
2021-05-10 00:14:03,wallstreetbets,"I looked it up. WY has 35 manufacturing facilities and 19 are lumber mills. Nothing they own is pulp-based. The rest of the facilities are OSB, plywood, engineered wood products, and MDF."
2021-05-09 20:51:01,wallstreetbets,I mean they could WACO us but other than that not much.
2021-05-09 23:20:15,wallstreetbets,"One thing to remember, wyoming has the highest number of registered explosive devices. That’s what we can do 😉"
2021-05-10 00:38:19,wallstreetbets,The Russians had the right idea. Dont spend money on imprisoning people just send them to Siberia. Wyoming could be used the same way.
2021-05-09 21:12:06,wallstreetbets,Yellowstone as in the super volcano?
2021-05-09 21:34:51,wallstreetbets,Fucking sold!
2021-05-10 00:21:13,wallstreetbets,buffalo bison tendies?
2021-05-09 22:41:39,wallstreetbets,"I was curious so I looked it up, here's a breakdown I found:

>17,493,875 acres by the Bureau of Land Management
9,215,971 acres by the U.S. Forest Service
70,930 acres by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
2,345,619 acres by the National Park Service
11,327 acres by the U.S. Department of Defense

As I expected the BLM holds the vast majority. That alone is kind of a suggestion of how low we value this land. The BLM is the agency that basically gets all the leftovers."
2021-05-09 21:06:22,wallstreetbets,i either can’t read or they took it off.
2021-05-09 22:45:51,wallstreetbets,Nothing is risky free.
2021-05-10 00:20:51,wallstreetbets,"Yea but my state averages $10k- $14k per undeveloped acre. 

And my thought is that climate change will flood alot of coastal US and maybe some of those people end up in WY and all of a sudden there is a demand.

Or if I decide to just give up on life I could just move to WY"
2021-05-09 20:46:59,wallstreetbets,Are you trolling it's the same everywhere
2021-05-10 00:14:07,wallstreetbets,Nothing here but dirt and rocks. All the oil and mining companies were taken out by the greenies. Pine bark beetles took out the forests. But at least there’s low taxes!
2021-05-09 23:08:46,wallstreetbets,"Like I said, distressed asset.  Hope you got paid tho."
2021-05-09 23:19:44,wallstreetbets,Or do other things good.

2021-05-10 00:38:54,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been holding WY since lumber prices started going up 6 months ago, not much change unfortunately"
2021-05-10 01:12:46,wallstreetbets,Looking at land outside Jackson...Telluride is home though
2021-05-09 22:10:06,wallstreetbets,You get paid for leaving it natural. It's an environmental program by the federal government. It's not a ton of money but its good if you are investing in land and want to just let it sit without having to bleed taxes.
2021-05-09 22:14:21,wallstreetbets,Conservation project. Keeps the farmers from plowing everything like a drunk frat boy. Pheasants and deer love crp
2021-05-10 08:11:03,wallstreetbets,Conservation Reserve Program is a new deal era program designed to act as a price support for crops by limiting the amount of crops grown by paying farmers to keep their farm land in native grasses. It also acts as an environmental program bc wildlife like native grasses more than endless rows of winter wheat or corn.
2021-05-09 22:14:51,wallstreetbets,I'm in so bump that average up
2021-05-10 05:57:05,wallstreetbets,"> 8.2 guns per resident.

2021-05-09 21:20:14,wallstreetbets,No he's not trolling. Clearly he's actually trying to take over the state of Wyoming.

2021-05-10 00:04:52,wallstreetbets,Yeah lol I'd rather try and annex Texas than Colorado. Would be an easier fight.
2021-05-10 08:42:24,wallstreetbets,Unless we get eagle county I'm not even interested.
2021-05-09 23:31:21,wallstreetbets,Well guess you better plan to come take them by force but they likely won’t be usable at that point 🤷‍♂️ don’t forget your winter coat. It was mid 20’s this morning

2021-05-10 09:36:34,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a pro-gun argument to me.
2021-05-10 00:06:26,wallstreetbets,Agree.  Texas is full of paper cowboys that come up here to ski in jeans.

Then got a 10x on SVC. Then a 20x on BB. Then 100x on GME. Also went to 0 on half a dozen others (fuck you especially AMD). All in a year.

I don't really know what is real anymore. A 20% gain used to be exciting, but now my brain literally can't interpret if 75% or 2x or 5x is even ""good"". I just stare at the blinking numbers on the screen...sometimes I hit buttons and make or lose money.

2021-05-10 06:25:15,wallstreetbets,"You may all ask yourself “why do stocks sell off when earnings get beat?”

It can take some research, but there are good reasons. 

1. Someone fundamental to the company is leaving a key role. 

2. The earnings guidance was lowered before earnings was announced by analysts and they were near the lowered earnings guidance. 

3. The forward guidance is directionless, or there is no forward guidance.

4. Futures plans for share dilution not priced in yet. 

5. Investor sentiment that the earnings beat will be difficult to beat again in the future. 

This is what’s called profit taking. Sometimes profit taking is short sighted tho and in my opinion present some of the most attractive investing scenarios. In my opinion DKNG and PENN are 2 of the most attractive sell offs I’ve seen in recent history price wise. PENN is more attractive than DKNG from a valuation perspective via what you’re paying in PE for each dollar gain.

Sometimes it’s better to watch the reaction to earnings for a buying opportunity rather than try to buy before earnings contemplating a run up.

The difficult part is you never really know when the sell off is done. It can be weeks or a month or two depending on other market forces like overall sympathy from downward pressure on the market in general. But at least recognize that sometimes sell offs present opportunities for buying."

2021-05-09 20:13:23,wallstreetbets,"""Stagflation is a period of rising inflation but falling output and rising unemployment.

Causes of stagflation:

\- Stagflation is often caused by a supply-side shock. For example, rising commodity prices, such as oil prices, will cause a rise in business costs and short-run aggregate supply will shift to the left.  **Commodity prices, such as lumber are shooting up right now**

\- Powerful trade unions.  If trade unions have strong bargaining power - they may be able to bargain for higher wages, even in periods of lower economic growth.  Higher wages are a significant cause of inflation.  **Minimum wage is being increased to $15**

\- Rise in structural unemployment.  If there is a decline in traditional industustries, we may get more structural unemployment and lower output.  **Unemployment high even though there are available jobs.  Employers having trouble finding people to work.**""

2021-05-10 01:13:49,wallstreetbets,"Time to put things into perspective. Zoom is not ""cheap"" under $300. PLTR is not ""cheap"" at $19. I remember when Zoom got to over $150 and everyone here was like holy shit what an overreaction, time to short it. Since it hit over $500 now it looks cheap at $300 but it's still double what we thought was even possible. PLTR IPOd at $10 and immediately fell to $9 for a few weeks. Just because it became a meme and went to over $40 doesn't mean it can't go back to $10 where it sat for weeks. Don't get caught into thinking you're getting a deal on dead stocks."

why shouldnt alphabet follow suit with 🍏and start systematically limiting facebook and others access to data on android? that would probabky increase their market share of targeted advertising, right?

Well my friend here’s an easy way  to lower your cost basis. sell at the money calls and then sell OTM puts. If you get assigned the shares OTM sell ATM calls again. Eventually they’ll get called away and you can repeat the process. This doesn’t work so well if your shit is so insanely overvalued that the volatility is punching you in the nuts tho so tread carefully with this strategy. If the Volatility is swinging around a certain price range and not really moving far outside of that then this works better. I’m not a financial professional you can still lose a shit ton of money doing this. Trade at your own risk.

Ideally you own 100 shares so you can sell the calls as you want them covered if you’re taking this strat."

2021-05-09 20:04:36,wallstreetbets,"GAMESTOP. 

It appears that GameStop could be nearing the end of its consolidation phase and on the cusp of a breakout back higher. This is highlighted not only by two converging trendlines, but also the Bollinger Band squeeze. Bullish trend support connecting the higher lows on 26 February, 25 March, 13 April and 04 May has potential to keep guiding GameStop higher. GME price action also seems to be flirting with a topside break of trendline resistance."

2021-05-10 05:56:15,wallstreetbets,"Tech is unlikely to see the bull run it saw in 2021 due to rising yields and likely rising rates next year. Couple that with the Biden tax reform and inflation concerns with SP at all time highs  and you’re more likely to see a large correction speaking 20-30% than you are a prolonged bull run. Expect more kangaroo markets to come with prices violently swinging down a few percentage points and back up before the correction hits.

If you’re currently holding tech as a loss due to buying at all time highs you have a few options. 

If you own 100 shares sell covered calls. 

Sell for a loss and look for other plays. 

Hold and hope the company someday can actually justify the valuation you bought for.

Sell and hold cash for the correction and ride cheap shares back up when it’s over."

2021-05-10 01:40:21,wallstreetbets,"Presumably you’d be buying shares of a tomato growing company which would see increased profits due to the price increase of real tomatoes. Thus your “virtual tomatoes” would go up. However shares of a tomato producing company is not really “virtual tomatoes”. To go with your analogy you’d really be talking about tomato futures which although virtual, do represent real life tomatoes. Those also would obviously go up because real life tomato prices are going up and your tomato futures are a contract for a bunch of real life tomatoes"

 and his man tits and his bloated beer gut rubbing against your back like gelatinous sandpaper. His left stubby orc hand rubbing your shoulder. His right hand is not rubbing your shoulder, because he has it wrapped around his semi-flaccid chode. He's using it to squeeze enough blood in the tip to make it firm enough to penetrate your anus. You can feel him rubbing it back and forth on your buttcheeks. You can hear him hawk a loogie right in to your ass crack, and know from the sound of it that it was a big yellow mound of mucus with only light saliva. He's breathing heavy and sweat is dripping on the nape of your neck. He whispers in your ear, ""You'd better HODL, sweetcheeks."" And then, pain. You can feel his spongy cock penetrate you. He thrusts like he's having a seizure while he wheezes and gasps for air.

There is next to no margin on mushroom growing once big warehouse sized grows start, they'll be as cheap as portabellas. There's a lot of room before you hit the floor on price when people can start. Most of these companies have next to nothing patentable. A gram of LSD can be made cheap and provides thousands and thousands of doses. Ketamine is cheap already and available but kind of insufficient. The real money will be made by whoever comes up with the modality people use. I'm looking for a company that produces psychedelic guided content and trip catering, stuff like that. Sell the shovels."

Banks have been prepping for years and it is just a base rate for floating rate loans.  Lots of corporate debt is fixed rate. Floating rate debt is for revolvers that are only tapped for seasonality and other temporary funding demands and the base rate is only meaningful if it goes way the fuck up like it did during the Financial Crisis.

2021-05-09 21:29:26,wallstreetbets,"Ummm ok mr numbers I think you mean to be browsing r/investing - sheesh 

“Grown-ups like numbers. When you tell them about a new friend, they never ask questions about what really matters. They never ask: ‘What does his voice sound like?’ ‘What games does he like best?’ ‘Does he collect butterflies?’ They ask: ‘How old is he?’ ‘How many brothers does he have?’ ‘How much does he weigh?’ ‘How much money does he have?’ Only then do they think they know him. If you tell grown-ups, ‘I saw a beautiful red brick house, with geraniums at the windows and doves at the roof…,’ they won’t be able to imagine such a house. You have to tell them, ‘I saw a house worth a thousand francs.’ Then they exclaim, ‘What a pretty house!”

2021-05-10 03:25:01,wallstreetbets,"See that’s where the problem lies. When you say “just plug the brain into a computer” you’re implying our brain works like a fricken USB stick. We don’t understand consciousness enough to know if we can even *upload fucking neural pathways*, let alone if it would really be YOU. Because think of it this way, “plugging your brain into a computer” would either result in the copying of your consciousness (because the process doesn’t have to kill you if you’re just uploading), or deactivating the neural pathways as they’re uploaded (like a cut and paste) which would kill the host. If it’s a copy then tada, it’s not really you! And if it’s a cut and paste situation? *We still don’t know if it’s even your consciousness that will experience the program*. Tiny minute errors would result in something that’s not YOU. Ya see the problem?"

2021-05-10 05:20:36,wallstreetbets,"What options did you buy or sell? I find buying calls are only a good idea if you can buy a 6 month long call or longer. The longer the call, the better the value."
2021-05-10 07:22:21,wallstreetbets,How is that mild
2021-05-10 10:48:18,wallstreetbets,Lol. I did the exact same thing back then.

2021-05-09 20:09:23,wallstreetbets,"so you were a dumbass that kept trying to bet on once of a life time crash and you got that, did not change your opinion a bit and proceeded to lose money in the strongest bull run in recent human history? got it."
2021-05-10 03:14:48,wallstreetbets,has everybody's portfolio gone to shit this past few months?
2021-05-09 20:43:20,wallstreetbets,I love how op thinks it’s cool to lose money. In fact this whole sub embellishes losses like it’s cool. Lol clowns

2021-05-09 20:58:23,wallstreetbets,There’s a lot more room down on these companies that are nothing more than cash furnaces on their books
2021-05-09 22:05:52,wallstreetbets,Actually the index has been going up about 1% on a week to week basis. You're losing 5% while the index is going up.

2021-05-09 22:17:11,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man that may be the nicest thing everyone has said about me. I do wear this mofo like a badge lmao. Probably would have been harder to hold at the peak if it had been more of a plateau instead of some looney toon falling off a cliff type shit. 

I definitely stuck to my guns for not better and definitely worse in terms of short term monetary gain. Whether the lessons I learned will pay off the ~188k is tbd. I still owe about 130k on the “lesson” lmao"
2021-05-09 22:22:06,wallstreetbets,That’s the one
2021-05-10 13:13:30,wallstreetbets,We were drunk on blind success lmao.
2021-05-09 20:11:27,wallstreetbets,"To be fair most of the money was lost at the start of the bull run while jobs were hemorrhaging and the only thing rebounding was the stock market, not my neighbors. I eventually got in on the run before too late but thanks for your kind words. Love and support you too boo."
2021-05-10 07:35:15,wallstreetbets,I’ve largely been trading sideways this last month and a half.
2021-05-10 13:21:26,wallstreetbets,"Yep thought it was soooo cool it took me about a year to stop being super salty about Wall Street getting bailed out and my options going to shit despite, at the time, bleak outlooks for Main Street. 

Also, if you read the subtitles of the pictures you will note that I described myself as getting slaughtered not having a grand old time. 

I shared to give others a laugh at my expense and to show the other side of what can happen when you make risky trades. I think most people will not attempt to lose ~200k to be “cool”. I will tell you that I was aiming for gains not losses. Just didn’t believe in the rationality of the quick rebound given what I was seeing out in the community and hearing from friends and family working in the medical fields. 

Regardless. Love you and hope you do well in the markets, boo."
2021-05-09 23:38:27,wallstreetbets,"Welcome, you can just leave your jacket over here…"
2021-05-10 13:17:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the biggest lesson I learned from trading was to assume every single gain is due to pure dumb luck and every loss is due to greed."
2021-05-09 23:41:07,wallstreetbets,"Lemme guess a ""mild"" stroke"
2021-05-10 08:05:39,wallstreetbets,Never ever ever play with family and/or friends money. That’s beyond autistic. You’re going to ruin relationships. You’re better off handing them parts of your winnings. Otherwise you keep using your own money machine with your own money. Or else you’re going to end up forever alone. Be careful. Nothing in the market is full proof
2021-05-09 21:07:15,wallstreetbets,I felt this in my soul

2021-05-09 21:55:36,wallstreetbets,If you habitually cut your winners short your portfolio will just be the losers surviving. Better to have a clue what your price target is.
2021-05-09 20:23:37,wallstreetbets,"1. Be wary of weeklies 2. Know your Greeks 3. Keep an eye on options liquidity/volume, don’t want to buy a gang of calls that you won’t be able to sell"
2021-05-10 04:51:10,wallstreetbets,Damn good luck. Although 300k seems like enough to do that

I have been procrastinating dealing with it as I have faced high losses as I got involved with options trading and didnt do well.I am worried about sending it to my father as he is the one who does the families taxes, but he will be very upset seeing the losses. With the due date almost here, is there anyway as a dependent I can file them myself or do I just have to send it to my father and deal with the consequences. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I have losses of 2.5k approximately so if there is the possibility of not having to file them given the low price please let me know as well. Thank you."
2021-05-09 20:11:54,wallstreetbets,"he gets a $3000 credit for claiming you as a dependent. But, you could threaten to take that away if you file your own tax return (provided you can get your own healthcare).. it's going to be financially stupid to try to hide it."

2021-05-10 00:28:28,wallstreetbets,"Couldn't you just file yourself and mark yourself as a dependent? I'm pretty sure most tax filing companies (TurboTax, Taxact, etc.) ask you at some point if you're a dependent. Just because your dad claims you doesn't mean you're unable to file your own taxes. I'd double check though.


Or you could just tell your dad."
2021-05-10 01:16:49,wallstreetbets,File your own taxes?
2021-05-10 01:45:16,wallstreetbets,Trading options as a teenager? Hard pass.

2021-05-10 03:17:00,wallstreetbets,Possibly this cause some of my cost basis on things are 0 although they shouldn’t be
2021-05-10 10:43:31,wallstreetbets,"You have to look at the actual 1099, not the supporting detail. If it reported only gain then you will need to file otherwise IRS will likely treat it as if it has zero cost basis and send a notice of tax due. 

If it does have cost basis listed the IRS may take that into account and treat it as an overall loss. They may still send a notice. They might not. They might not take the cost basis into consideration. 

How I would do it *if* I didn’t want parents to find out, is if I had no other income, I’d file and check the box that I could be claimed as a dependent. Then list proceeds and cost basis accordingly on the proper forms. I’d probably use a free online software to make it easier. 

The loss can be carried forward too to offset income in a future year. 

IRS publication 929 gives the detail under reporting unearned income as a dependent."
2021-05-09 23:23:16,wallstreetbets,"Seriously though. I wouldn't listen to me :p its definitely not advice, and as always do your own research. 
That being said the IRS doesn't give a flying fk about you unless they think you owe them money."

2021-05-09 20:44:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’ve been waiting for months for the price rally to happen. The reason it’s been and still is undervalued is due to bankruptcy risk destroying the levered beta, but with the deleveraging from the ENBL acquisition and the pay down of like $3.5b in debt, analysts are going to have up their PTs since the bankruptcy risk caused by COVID has been largely decreased."

2021-05-10 00:34:22,wallstreetbets,"Anyone that can't fuck whatever woman wants to fuck that woman.

It's not that any particular race is prettier or sexier. It's simply that you want whatever isn't around.

It's human nature for a man to hunt what is not near him.

It's human nature to find a race you're not used to seeing attractive.

To claim otherwise would be a lie.

But hey, that's why sex tourism is so big."

2021-05-10 03:54:36,wallstreetbets,1/2 season
2021-05-10 17:57:03,wallstreetbets,I do agree the last season was not near as good hopefully that was just because of covid.

2021-05-09 22:03:44,wallstreetbets,It started out my favorite show but it slowly slid downhill. Current season seems like writers trying to work in too many pop culture references instead of writing and the Taylor character was interesting at first but she stayed around waaaay too long and got more annoying than useful.

2021-05-10 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How deep will iOS tracking ban tank FB? The latest iOS change forces developers to have their apps ask users for permission to opt-in for the apps to track their use and traffic across the web. Per this article only 4% of US based users granted this permission: https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-5-users-reject-app-tracking-165309407.html

Facebook tried to fight this change in legal system. Now they’re trying to fight it by having banners in the FB and Instagram apps asking users to opt-in and pleading it is what keeps the app free and by opting in it helps support local small businesses. https://i.imgur.com/6Quah0Z.jpg

Even if a slightly larger percent opts in how does this not decimate FB’s stock price?

Positions: nothing yet, but thinking of buying Puts. Unsure how soon and how deeply this will attack the price which is why I started the discussion."

2021-05-10 07:59:09,wallstreetbets,"Facebook makes it money from advertisements. Advertisers obviously want the best bang for their buck. But how much they're willing to spend, that's something that's preallocated as part of their advertisement budget.

While this might hurt the advertiser's ROI, it's not going to significantly affect how much they actually spend especially in the short term. And facebook as a whole will still have the better advertiser dollars.

Facebook isn't likely to lose any of that advertisement money directly from this change. What they're hoping is this doesn't result in cascading changes in the industry (IE google, and maybe even law), which makes them less competitive as a whole."

And thats why for most people, investing in FAAG is no brainer."
2021-05-10 08:45:57,wallstreetbets,"I’m not sure about your logic there. I get it that paid media ad spend budgets are likely fairly set, but if I noticed a significant drop off in the response to my paid social ads I might redirect some of the pod social ad spend dollars to other channels of the media plan like paid search, display, email marketing, etc. Facebook convinced all these small and large businesses to help them build their company as a one-stop destination, but many brands and businesses are seeing their organic and even paid reach and response drop a ton. iOS users are generally a higher income audience and so they’d, as a whole, have a higher CPM. Facebook still tracks everything within their walled garden. I’m just trying to quantify how much of a hit not having this third-party activity will be to their bottom line."
2021-05-10 12:28:50,wallstreetbets,Facebook is also using algorithms to project and estimate your revenue from iPhones right now. No idea how accurate it is. I need to dig into Google Analytics.

We already made the changes needed months ago, same as most tech companies. So for FB to be having ""problems"" now is a joke and a straight up scam. Crazy to see people say citidel is a scam but FB is just down on their luck."
2021-05-10 02:12:53,wallstreetbets,As other online advertising plattform FB is already working on cookieless tracking. They can match your data from your profile with data you use on online shops to retarget you with their ad network.
2021-05-09 22:38:57,wallstreetbets,Man fuck Apple. Piece of trash
2021-05-10 09:15:18,wallstreetbets,"You're right, some might switch if they are seeing lower hits. That won't be obvious right away. Even if it's lower for one quarter, that alone won't be enough for most people to switch marketing plans. This isn't going to manifest in the short term in my opinion.

It might affect the stock price, but you'll see a reversal when FB posts earnings and they're unaffected by the change in the short term.

As far as the long term, it's hard to say. It might make other advertising venues more profitable, but it still won't be as targeted. As you said the iOS audience is highly coveted. In-app data (like browsing habits and preferences) is still going to be collected for things like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp; and people will still want to advertise in those apps.

I think Facebook's concerns are more long-term focused, but also likely an overreaction on their part."

The largest company in the world choose $TSLA batteries 🔋 on their new massive solar farm https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/04/01/apple-will-use-tesla-megapack-batteries-at-its-solar-farm-facility.html

$TSLA has partnered w utilities and municipalities and many not even announced https://www.eei.org/future/Pages/story.aspx?sid=8_Partners:%20Tesla%20and%20Southern

$TSLA GREW 162% YoY on installed solar https://www.pv-tech.org/tesla-solar-growth-continues-but-significant-mistakes-in-roof-assessments-holding-back-solar-roof-progress/

$TSLA delivered 184,800 vehicles Q1 2021 for a 109% increase YoY while there is a chip shortage https://www.pv-tech.org/tesla-solar-growth-continues-but-significant-mistakes-in-roof-assessments-holding-back-solar-roof-progress/

While everyone tries to figure out batteries $TSLA owns a fucking nickel island (I know it is a partnership) https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/business-56288781.amp

$TSLA is so far ahead of legacy automakers that VW is buying carbon fucking offsets from them https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/volkswagen-buys-carbon-credits-from-tesla

AI and data are the name of the game and the amount of miles driven and data complied doesn’t even really have a close competitor https://towardsdatascience.com/why-teslas-fleet-miles-matter-for-autonomous-driving-8e48503a462f

$TSLA is now scaling. It took 168 days to build 🇨🇳 Gigafactory. Berlin and TX soon and then India and then https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/elon-musk-opened-tesla-s-shanghai-gigafactory-in-just-168-days

$TSLA ⬆️ 52.92% last 6 months; ⬆️ 310.09% last year; ⬆️ 1,581.61% past 5 years.

There is much more.

$TSLA is basically an Index fund of EV, solar, AI, data, batteries, and more. $GM might be able to produce EV Hummer in 2023 for $110K+. $F just created a battery division and location. 

$TSLA is literally 10 years ahead of the competition. I will be placing an order for a Model Y Long Range this summer. 

Long over 100+ shares, Jan 2023 $500 LEAPS, $800 5/21 CCs, and a $540 July CSP.

2021-05-09 23:45:27,wallstreetbets,"Another thing to consider: Tesla hires super smart people, like really smart. Go to Linkedin and check the colleges they hire most engineers from, they are all from top 10 universities for engineering. Now, these smart engineers are joining Tesla obviously to do interesting work but also $$$ since other companies are ready to hire them.

These engineers' most of salary comes from TSLA stock. So its customary for Tesla to maintain high stock price, else they leave. In the last 1 year, Tesla has been hiring engineers like crazy. The way stock offering works is it depends on tesla stock price for past 1 month I believe before engineers join. So almost all new engineers have signed deal with Tesla at high stock price. 

Elon knows this and will certainly try to at least maintain stock price. I believe he will include a portion of Starlink and SpaceX public offering from Tesla. I think when he is ready to take them public, he will first buy some % of these companies with TSLA cash flow. And then open it up for the market. 

If they don't do that, Tesla stock will definitely crater since all Elon fans and non-fans love SpaceX. They will jump in on it left and right. This will make those engineers make some tough choices as their stock compensation goes down. Not being able to attract top talent will be the end of Tesla. Just my 2 cents."

I think other EV’s that are promised by other auto makers need to work out a lot of kinks before the general public starts liking them meanwhile Tesla is trying to make their base cars cheaper. Seems like Tesla will win out in a decade but short term 1-5 years it could fluctuate a bit."

I work in Ai/ml field.

Data is important.  But your assumptions are just so basic.

Why do you think Tesla sales are insane ?  China?  People literally get told they are allowed to buy a car, but it must be EV.  Eventually those sales will be for a Chinese EV car company.  

Solar panels?  Rofl.  Solar sucks and requires expensive af batteries as well.  Long term you would be much better off putting that roof money into a normal roof and investing the rest in a boomer index fund, and buy 3 roofs over what would have been the life of that roof.  Your savings in electricity will come nowhere near paying off that roof.  

The only way this is economic is with government assistance, aka tax dollars.

Tesla are fun cars.  I drove one today for 2 hours.  The guy that owns it is rich and doesn’t need it for practical reasons.  He has his own charger etc.

Normal people don’t buy these things for practicality.  It’s for bling value.

This entire electric revolution is born of the idea that “it’s the future” and “cuz renewables is free energy”.  

No, renewables suck even bill gaytss admits that.  Nuclear/NG is all we need.  Suplementing with green energy is a practice in politics.

The only way this is the future, is if govt forces it on people through extreme mandates.  Not normal subsidies.

Given Europe has a negative gdp growth and the us is firing on all cylinders, shitty economies will learn the hard way what expensive inefficient energy does to their way of life.

*edit* also, lvl 2 autonomous not amazing.  Engineers inside Tesla admit Elon exaggerates about achieving l5.  And some are leaving for lidar companies.

Also edit;  car companies buy carbon credits because EV isn’t profitable yet since there isn’t enough market for it.  Non rich people just don’t want to wait 30 minutes at super chargers or pay crazy money for an electric car.  20% of EV owners sell that shit fast.  They realize the reality isn’t what it’s cracked up to be.    The governments are literally shitting on standard car companies for carbon emissions and despite how easy it is to make an electric car, they don’t make them.  Because normal cars have higher demand and are more practical for normal people.  It’s that simple.  The carbon credits are worth it for the other auto manufacturers.

As per bill gates, the electric car was an answer to a question no one ever asked."

Vast majority of Tesla's revenue comes from car sales. There goes your ""ETF"" argument.  


Tesla is valued as if it's going to conquer whole automotive industry. It's clearly not the case, Tesla is already losing BEV market share in Europe, because guess what, european OEMs have a lots of very good EV models out there already.  


Tesla has massive problems in China due to US x China relationship. It's obvious that China will protect Nio and Xpeng and Tesla will be losing their market share in future.  


Tesla isn't ahead in autonomous driving. While Waymo doesn't have as much collected data, they have virtual maps and tons of machine learning hours done in simulation. Also MobilEye has probably more data collected than Tesla.  


You claim that Tesla has secured their battery future, yet they are the company that doesn't seem to be engaged in solid state battery research. VW has $QS, Ford + BMW got stake in Solid Power, Toyota has joint venture with Panasonic... SSB are the future and missing on this technology could be extremely damning for Tesla. Also Tesla's R&D budget is still just a fraction of R&D budgets of big OEMs.  


Lucid is behind the corner looking to take a crown as a EV technology leader. Apple is about to enter the EV market targeting the same type of customers as Tesla. Tesla keeps delaying Cybertruck and will very likely miss out on the US's most important market - losing ground to Rivian, $Ride, Ford...  


Tesla has still enormous built quality issues and is viewed as poorly made car by many car enthusiasts."

You're clearly sceptical, so let me ask you three questions:

* How many cars do you expect Tesla to have on the road by 2030? At the end of 2020 there were about 1,5 million and they'll sell about another 1 million this year.

* What do you expect the take rate (in percentages) to be once FSD is 100% operational? Meaning individuals or businesses can let Teslas drive around as robotaxis making money for them?

* What do you expect the monthly subscription price for FSD to be once it's released? The current upfront purchase price is $10,000 and this will increase as the software matures. Monthly subscription will be more expensive than upfront purchase price over a 5-10 year duration."

- TSLA is worth more than all the other vehicle manufacturers combined, so even if they had a monopoly on the entire vehicle market, their valuation would be barely justified. In reality, they never will have a monopoly as there is so much other competition and money flowing into the EV sector.
- While renewables are important for the future, the margins for solar are terrible because of technological restraints on renewable energy storage.
- Self-driving AI is likely a decade away from being fully autonomous and there will almost certainly be a huge amount of competition by then.
- Providing subscription services for Tesla features is a cool idea, but will not work as long as there are comparable EV alternatives from competitors.

2021-05-10 02:10:20,wallstreetbets,"I should have made it clearer. The total AV market might be worth trillions. But Tesla will not generate TRILLIONS. Why? Because they won't be the only provider.
Your linked report was from 2017 and ARK states AV will be commercially available in 2020 (it wasn't). That report was optimistic at best. 
According to ARKs recent 2021 Tesla price target, 2025 projected revenue from AV will be 327 billion with a 20% margin (This is hilariously ridiculous,😂 but its another discussion so let's run with it).

Yes, I am a bit skeptical regarding the valuation of Tesla.

1. I don't believe Tesla will sell 1M vehicles this year. They sold 184,000 in Q1, to achieve 1M by the end of the year, they need to sell an average roughly 270,000 vehicles in Q2 - 4. Not impossible, but highly improbable. GigaBerlin seems to be running into problems, Tesla is facing some headwinds in China, and other manufacturers are releasing their own EVs cutting into tesla sales. 

2. I also don't believe Tesla will win the Autonomous driving race. Why? Because other players are currently ahead. Baidu announced last week it is  is launching a Robotaxi service in China. Waymo got approval in Carlifonia and Cruise is also going strong. The total number of miles they drive autonomously is a lot lot more than Tesla. [Link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22276851/california-self-driving-autonomous-cars-miles-waymo-cruise-2020)
Musk has promised FSD since 2016. Its still not here. It most likely won't happen this year either. Also, even if Tesla does manage to get FSD to actually work, I have heard doubtful comments from even tesla fans that the current cars are well equipped to be truly autonomous in the future. 

3. I think the most brilliant thing Elon has done so far, is getting some users to pay $10,000 for a beta ""FULL SELF DRIVING"" software that he has been promising for years and is anything but FULL and doesn't do what it's supposed to. On top of that, he gets back actual usage data from the paying users! This makes me smile every time I think about it. It's similar to me PAYING Pfizer to take part in a Covid drug trial. 

To top it off, we have Tesla saying this to the California DMV

Plus the whole show for me is FSD and starship progress. Elon or no Elon those are their two most important projects. If they keep ahead of everyone else then they’ll be successful. Its easy to keep track of this because there are constantly new public videos you watch to personally validate they are progressing.

None of those videos need Elon or (for the most part) have Elon in them. If progress stops or they lose the lead— that is a good time to pull out."

2021-05-10 11:14:57,wallstreetbets,You'll find consensus that you actually make the most money selling options about a month out.

2021-05-09 22:41:00,wallstreetbets,"First off, the electric charging market is actually a lot better than what people think, especially in the coasts. MKBHD recently mentioned on his podcast that he was surprised at how well he could ride the Porsche Taycan considering its charging network. IIRC, he said that if it wasn’t for Tesla Autopilot, he’d pick the Taycan all day.  
 
 Second off, this is a pretty surface level analysis. Tesla is far from the “manufacturing nightmares” stage that we saw them in the late 2010s. They’ve almost perfected the art of manufacturing EVs and are prepping to bring an even cheaper EV to the market. The Model 3 for 38k is not a bad price at all - I mean, that’s about the same as a new Camry XLE with a V6. The real problem is that you’d be stupid to not get autopilot, which then makes the Model 3 a 50k+ car.  
  
I think what Tesla will need to do going forward is offer a 22-25k car that costs 35k after autopilot. Since Teslas are already autopilot equipped, I’d image a lot of people who buy the baseline 25k model would upgrade within a year or so. Moreover, Tesla has made strides in battery tech and release the Plaid Model S with in-house batteries that are structural in nature. They are strongly believed to have made breakthroughs in battery tech that will enable them to double (or more) their car’s current battery density (hence why they promise the Roadster to have a 650 mi+ range). If they are able to increase the battery density and decrease the cost/cell using new in-house manufacturing techniques, they’ll have drastically reduced the most expensive component in their cars.  
  
All in all, I think Tesla’s future and stock projection is very bright. We’ve seen a dip in TSLA, largely due to a correction after their massive hype wave in 2019. I think TSLA’s price will correlate strongly with how successful they are in their battery tech. Outside of cars, Tesla will have a huge market in the renewable energy market sector, which they are already blooming in. There’s no reason to bet against TSLA currently and no legacy car manufacturer is close to surpassing Tesla."
2021-05-09 20:59:05,wallstreetbets,"They got the price down from $150k to $30ish-k in 10 years.  All while providing features and adornments that are usually reserved for $80k cars.

A Rav4 EV is $40k and it goes 40mi on one charge.  A freaking boring ass Rav4.

Meanwhile Tesla 10 years from now is probably going to be making their own batteries while Toyota and VW and the like fight each other for the right to pay 300% as much from another company."

Again, PE ratio means nothing for looking forward unless you are trying to predict a future PE ratio. Then you can compare with how they perform. For example, if I predict TSLA to have a PE ratio of 500 by 2023 as part of my investment thesis then I can say look at their PE in 2023 and see how it did with what I'm expecting. Saying ""O IT HAS A HIGH PE RATIO ITS OVERPRICED"" objectively means absolutely nothing by itself because very successful businesses such as Amazon have had higher PE ratios before going on large bull runs."
2021-05-10 09:10:53,wallstreetbets,I agree; a high PE ratio has growth priced in. If you're 40 or younger you still have plenty of time to continue being invested in growth stocks. If you're looking to retire in the next 5 years you probably want to preserve as much money as possible with lower risk and lower returns so it makes more sense to avoid growth stocks or have them be a smaller percentage of your portfolio.

Not really. There was a ton of press on a single protester saying Tesla's brakes were faulty, but Tesla open sourced the data and the brakes were working fine. Demand for Tesla in China is increasing.

> and other manufacturers are releasing their own EVs cutting into tesla sales.

Not at all. Tesla is still selling every car the make. Moreover, just one month into the quarter, every single car they'll make this quarter has already been pre-ordered. That's the strongest demand they've ever seen.

> I also don't believe Tesla will win the Autonomous driving race. Why? Because other players are currently ahead.

Another myth. All of the parties you mentioned are using geofenced autonomy. While that can certainly work for certain locations and could give those parties a piece of the pie initially, it's not a global solution and will eventually be competed out of the market as actual full scale solutions create a global network. It's basically like if Apple would've launched their iPhone to only work in certain cities. It could've had some success initially, but ultimately people want to use the same product wherever they go.

It's very unlikely that Tesla will solve FSD this year, but with the FSD Beta they've also clearly entered the second curve of the S-curve that self learning AI systems follow. On top of that, they have the most powerful supercomputer in the world coming online this year, that is specifically built to train neural networks. Personally, I would bet on robotaxis being 2-5 years away from being a commercially viable product, but it's certainly happening this decade.

> I think the most brilliant thing Elon has done so far, is getting some users to pay $10,000 for a beta ""FULL SELF DRIVING"" software that he has been promising for years and is anything but FULL and doesn't do what it's supposed to.

Another popular narrative that's not based in reality. Nobody pays $10,000 for what FSD is today or event next year. They pay it for what it will be one day in the future (when it will be $20,000+ to buy the same software), or for a variety of other reasons. Like being able to be part of the development and experience, because of the higher safety (you're 9 times less likely to have an accident with it enabled) or simply because they enjoy the more relaxed form of driving, especially on long trips, where you don't need to do anything except monitor the road.

So the brilliant part is that Elon managed to make it a win-win. Customers are happy because they have something cool for a lower price than what it will be when it's ready and are able to contribute to making it better, much like an early-access video game. Tesla is happy because people are paying them to develop their own software.

It's fine, the car changes lanes for you on the highway, that's about it. It doesn't transfer to your next car and depending on how the car is sold it mightn't transfer to the next owner.

>It's not. It's still on track, the reports about a 6 months delay were bogus

This has nothing to do with misinformation. GigaBerlin was planned to be operational in July. I live in Germany, and yes the headlines might have been overstated, however even the most optimistic of Tesla Fans have to admit that this time-line is not feasible and earliest opening will probably be later in the year. Without this factory opening on time without any delay, again, it is highly improbable that Tesla sells 1M vehicles this year. 


>Not really. There was a ton of press on a single protester saying Tesla's brakes were faulty, but Tesla open sourced the data and the brakes were working fine. Demand for Tesla in China is increasing.

This is not only to do with a single customer complaining about brakes. Chinese authorities have started getting involved amid complaints about the quality and safety of their vehicles. [Link](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55990821)
[Link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-regulators-summon-tesla-on-quality-issues-11612788928)

No matter how you look at this, it can't be good especially when other Chinese EV manufacturers are rolling out their own vehicles. I suspect that the authorities in China are probably trying to favour local EV manufacturers by leaning on Tesla, but again, this is not good news for Tesla in its biggest market. 


>Another myth. All of the parties you mentioned are using geofenced autonomy. While that can certainly work for certain locations and could give those parties a piece of the pie initially, it's not a global solution and will eventually be competed out of the market as actual full scale solutions create a global network. It's basically like if Apple would've launched their iPhone to only work in certain cities. It could've had some success initially, but ultimately people want to use the same product wherever they go.

Dude, there's no comparison between developing iPhones and Autonomous Vehicles. Not even close. Waymo and Cruise are taking the conservative approach to developing their software with the aim of scaling up when they perfect it. Is this the right approach? IMO yes. It is subjective, but i don't believe releasing an incomplete beta software into the wild ( like Tesla) is the responsible thing to do. Just look at the negative news it generates whenever a Tesla crashes (whether FSD was involved or not). Also the approach being used by Tesla (only cameras) is debatable compared to other companies that use LIDAR and Radar and Cameras.

Meh, how people choose to spend their 10k right now is up to them. Do I think it's a rip off? Hell yes, considering this current FSD beta is nothing more than a glorified driver assistance system and the full FSD will not be released any time soon. But again, people can do what they want with their cash. And as ex-wife once said said, I am a f*****g cheap bastard. 
I do agree that it's brilliant from Elon.

I'm sorry but this is a ridiculous take. So when the CEO of a company comes out and promises a product release, we should take it with a grain of salt? And not take his words as fact? I'm sorry but that is unacceptable. Why should anyone accept being stringed along by Elon? The CEO of one of the most valuable companies on earth? If he tells me that my Tesla which I preorder will have 490 miles of range or will fully charge in 1h, should I also not take that as fact? Why should I then believe that FSD will work as promised? Why should I believe anything he says regarding car safety? Why should I believe the Model 3 I bought last year is equipped to have FSD? 

I also agree that Robotaxis are 2-5 years away as well though. 

>
Not at all. Tesla is still selling every car the make. Moreover, just one month into the quarter, every single car they'll make this quarter has already been pre-ordered. That's the strongest demand they've ever seen.


Let me clarify. Demand for EVs are increasing worldwide and even VW and others have preorders. The point is as other manufacturers release their own EVs, the market share that Tesla could've captured as the flagship EV manufacturer is decreasing quickly especially since Tesla cannot ramp up production quickly enough to match the likes of VW. 
For instance, here in Germany, in Q1 2020 Tesla sold 3300 vehicles compared to 6000 in Q1 2021. That is a very impressive x2 increase. 
However, VW sold 6000 vehicles in Q1 2020 but sold 16000 in Q1 2021. This is almost a x3 increase, and currently has a 25% share of the market. This means its VW not Tesla that is most likely to meet the demand for EVs in Europe simply because they can make them faster than Tesla thereby capturing a bigger market share."

>*It sounds almost constructive, almost reasonable. But there are a few hundred thousand of us who know it is NOT true.*  
>  
>*You have been merciless with GME-related content, regardless of its quality, sometimes with literally disgraceful deletions and bans.*  
>  
>*Also, as a moderation team, you have allowed discussions with unacceptable belligerence, tones and terms towards GME shareholders.*  
>  
>*Like when the inside joke of the sub ""$ROPE"" went from being inclusive humor (like ""retard"" or ""autistic""), to being used as a harassment tool against GME holders... pepperridge farm remembers.*  
>  
>*And it's a simple example of what you guys have done or allowed (by action or omission).*  
>  
>*You have acted this way for quite some time... and suddenly the sub goes back to being completely ticker friendly, and we get gaslighted by treating us as conspiracists?*  
>  
>*Hey, I'm not telling you this from animosity, I'm telling you from the perspective of someone who had you as his ONLY follow (and favorited) on Reddit. This is someone who admired your work and dedication to the sub, until you left, came back, and suddenly you didn't even seem like you anymore. Nor was this the place we knew it to be.*  
>  
>*And hey, I'm a critical thinker and perfectly capable of contemplating the possibility of being completely wrong. What precisely bothers me, as a person with critical thinking and perfectly capable of contemplating the possibility of being completely wrong... is that you guys don't even contemplate the possibility of having done things wrong, when it's obvious and it's there for all to see.*  
>  
>*Not to mention that if GME's thesis is true, the possibility of manipulation of sentiment in the net and the media (in the middle of 2021) becomes a certainty. Ergo your recent drift as a sub would indicate a take, then move on to the tactic of generate positive sentiment, to lately exploit the sentiment and the huge number of subscribers in this sub.*

2021-05-10 00:42:35,wallstreetbets,"The strategy I would take if I was gonna take on UFC

1. Get 2 big names that are past their prime, but still have the ability to really fight. You over pay cuz these guys are looking for their last couple pay days. Not 2 guys that should be retired that will put on a cringe fest. This is a pretty obvious play.

2. Go after the guys that are up and comers, focus con guys with exciting fighting styles and big personalities. Guys that UFC isn’t really paying a bunch of attention to, then you give them the star treatment. (Read about how Under Armour pulled Steph Curry away from Nike.)

3. This is the real play that is under valued. Go after the lower weight divisions. UFC already doesn’t pay attention to these smaller fighters. Demetrius Johnson, was one of the most dominant fighters in history and UFC really didn’t promote him and he walked. The thing about these smaller guys is that they are really active. You promote it as this exciting style; it’s the Steph Curry of fighting, it’s the spread offense, it’s uptempo.  These guys are undervalued, this is the money ball play. 

4. You go after fighters that are pissed at UFC. You also get UFC to up their pay making it harder for them to hold on to their whole roster. You give Conor McGregor an offer, sure he probably isn’t going to take it, but now he has leverage to get a bigger pay day. 

5. The big names looking for a pay day are never the last fight, heck maybe they are the 3rd to last fight. They are their to bring the fight fans and the casual fans in. Then you give them the young fighters with potential and the smaller fighters (don’t call it featherweight or whatever, call it like hornet class or something that sounds dangerous). 

6. You have your PR/hype guy take smack about Dana/UFC, say UFC is boring, that they protect certain fighters, etc. try to drum up that free press, get that Twitter discussion going. Then hype up your hornet class fighters.

Full disclosure I don’t know shit about mma, I’ve never bought a pay-per-view fight, I rarely watch any fights live (I watch the replays so I can just watch the fighting, like an hour of time isn’t worth maybe 15 minutes of action), I’m just an idiot on the Internet.

I am available for any type of consulting work, so if you are trying to start a new fight promotion (really any type of sports league or any business for that matter). I may be available, we could negotiate a price, I’m probably less expensive than your typical consultant and my ideas are probably just as interesting (if not more)."

2021-05-10 16:43:12,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much yes. Once of twice PPV, and then 2 ord 3 cards on ESPN i think.

I'm a Swede and the only PPV is when Conor McGregor is fighting. Rest is through stream viaplay. Cost around 40 dollar a month, mainly because of premier league and Champions League football.

So I can't realy say what kind services they have in the US. But i think it's espn plus or something."

2021-05-10 12:26:02,wallstreetbets,I do know what I'm talking about though. Ryan hall has been pretty open about the fact that a long list of ranked fighters have refused to fight him. Sure he was injured so had to pull out of his last fight but the real reason he hasn't fought in 2 years mostly boils down to not being able to find an opponent.

2021-05-09 22:25:33,wallstreetbets,"This is actually pretty good DD. I would add that the trumped up claims of an investigation are basically nonsense that Hindenburg blew out of proportion for their stupid short report. It's standard for any health insurer that deals with Medicare to get hit with these and doesn't impact business in any meaningful way despite the way the idiot shorts like to frame it.

You might as well go claim that you should short CVS because they've had god knows how many civil investigative demands over the years as well as an actual DOJ lawsuit. \[[1](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/petitions-quash/cvs-caremark-ftc/080620cvspetitiontolimit.pdf)\]\[[2](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-files-lawsuit-against-omnicare-country-s-largest-long-term-care)\]\[[3](https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-cvs-health-received-civil-investig/brief-cvs-health-received-civil-investigative-demand-from-attorney-general-of-minnesota-idUSFWN1KU0P7)\] It's just a fact of life in the healthcare industry if you're billing the government, they're going to constantly do investigations into your billing to make sure that you're not robbing them blind. Claiming that this somehow is an actual risk to their business is idiotic, they're continuing to expand and roll out in new states with Medicare and this is just standard operations. Maybe they should have revealed it pre-IPO but they probably didn't think of it as a big deal because most large healthcare entities regularly get hit with these.

IMO, to see a meaningful gamma squeeze you would need for the price to hold over $10 over the next week. I suspect that's why the shorts seem so hell bent on continuing to pile in, they need it to stay under $10 so that a gamma bomb doesn't go off and destroy their positions. I think the primary issue going against a gamma squeeze/short squeeze here without incredible earnings is just that WSB is more interested in other stocks like GME that are all about nostalgia and a simple to understand business where you're just selling video games. Trying to understand the business model behind Medicare Advantage requires a whole bunch of thought and research so most people don't know wtf they're reading.

For that reason I've just bought a crapload of shares and sold off puts to add to my holdings if it drops. I think long term this is going to be a fantastic stock to hold over a 5-10 year window."

2021-05-10 00:03:18,wallstreetbets,"Please show me anything that backs up these statements.

2021-05-10 12:50:52,wallstreetbets,This bro gets it. The investigation being a concern is laughable

2021-05-09 20:01:07,wallstreetbets,Is this the way?
2021-05-09 22:30:28,wallstreetbets,"That is true but I think the issue is that it's just not as easy for the masses to get behind CLOV as it is for them to get behind easy to understand stuff like ""store that sells video games"". You need them to understand the profit potential with Medicare Advantage, to understand that the CIDs are common in the healthcare industry and a nonissue, etc.

People on RH invest in shit because they think the picture of a dog is super cute. That's the problem you're facing here, the intelligent people managing big money who know that this is a great buy are adding (Baillie Gifford, Vanguard, Blackrock) but they're not trying to trigger a short term squeeze, they're going for that 5-10 year out 5-10 bagger.

I'd LOVE for it to squeeze short term but if it doesn't I'm willing to hold 5-10 years to see where it goes. I think that's the best mindset here-we buy because it's a fucking great long term hold and then if it happens to squeeze the shit out of these idiot shorts then awesome, I'll sell to them for a quick profit. If it doesn't then I'll just hold and make the money down the road and I'm fine letting the shorts act like morons until then."
2021-05-10 00:06:45,wallstreetbets,I hope you're right. The probabilities of the dealers having already delta hedged their exposure is high. They too can see the OI and put/call ratio. A gamma squeeze would be more eminent if and when the buying volume shoots up in a short period. This ideally needs a strong catalyst and luck.
2021-05-09 22:50:36,wallstreetbets,You’re right. People will get greased and home girl on the team is only a plus.
2021-05-10 14:14:02,wallstreetbets,"First of all: username definitely checks out.

Secondly, it's not good DD if the bear cases aren't even acknowledged. Even if you're bullish on the company you need to be able to address potential problems or else it's just good old fashioned confirmation bias and hope."

2021-05-09 20:09:52,wallstreetbets,Not a tax professional but this is how I understand it. That's why it's called a wash sale adjustment in your brokerage tracker. If you read the IRS rules they talk about adding the disallowed loss to the basis of the overall position.
2021-05-10 09:10:45,wallstreetbets,"that’s the tricky thing about wash sales. you cant offset ur gains with losses, so ur profits look inflated. the article is just reporting a real situation as far as i can tell"
2021-05-09 21:21:33,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, so wash sales don't really matter much if you fully exit the position before the end of the year I think. You'll still end up with the correct amount being deducted for taxes."
2021-05-10 09:14:08,wallstreetbets,"From what I understood they can only tax the 45k. Maybe he'll have to give it all away but he doesn't have 800k of debt to pay back, right ?"
2021-05-10 12:00:52,wallstreetbets,"that would be true if every trade he did was on a different stock or if he waited 30 days between the sale of a stock and buying in on the same stock. if u buy and sell the same stock continuously, wash sale rules kick in. i dont agree with these rules, but they exist"

They were at 205 a few weeks ago and now 165 on no particular news. And the Apple chips are not going to affect them.  AAPL itself is also a buy today but I figure more bang for the buck with Skyworks so I am selling some T and VZ (my parking places for cash) and buying SWKS and will buy more tomorrow if it sinks any further. Last time there was a big tech sell-off SWKS bottomed around 165 so this may be the extent of it

However… Xi is currently in the process of bringing Alibaba and Tencent to heel. Many reasons for this… Xi’s small man syndrome, Jack Ma’s speech ripping the state controlled Banks, CCP’s desire to control all technology to be used for their own purposes. First Shot: Ant Financial IPO cancelled
Second Shot: Jack Ma “disappears” for a few weeks and then “reappears”
Third Shot: anti-monopoly fines against Alibaba and Tencent
Forth Shot: New rules regarding financial companies that are designed to force Ant Financial and Tencent to operate under stricter financial regulations vs the pretty loose fin tech rules they previously had. 

So… sure… just be careful. Yes, China does care about competition with USA. However, Xi has shown that he is perfectly willing to do whatever he wants to strengthen his domestic control no matter the international perception or fallout.

2021-05-09 22:10:21,wallstreetbets,Yes… but Alibaba owns 33% of Ant and so a significant amount of Alibaba’s market cap includes consideration of this. Not to mention Ant is a huge factor in Alibaba’s ecosystem.

Another option gaining traction are the newly minted Thorium fuel reactors. The energy density isn’t as high, but Thorium is more readily available and it’s radiological waste breaks down faster as the half life decay chains are shorter.
Lastly, South Africa is using a sodium pebble bed reactors that is intriguing as it is nearly impossible to melt down.

The more you hedge your position, the less your potential profits, so we hedge only the ""worst-case"" scenario, which is cheap.

With those kind of model, you face a very frustrating compromise. The more flexible the model is, the better it fits the realized path. The worse it performs at forecasting. 

I do not think there can be any model, calibrated on past returns that can effectively forecast future returns. You would need a conditional model that includes historical prices,  option data information, analyst reports, sentiment data,  etc. But,  that is my opinion, based on my limited experience. 

On the volatility side,  there was an article that compared multiple volatility forecast models and GARCH(1,1) was the best model out there. I was somewhat successful at forecasting IV using NGARCH(1,1) (Engle and Ng 2003, I think) I wish I had access to recent historical IV to test whether this can be traded."

For me I got diagnosed with everything but autism/Aspergers and it wasn’t until about 5 years ago that my mom and I (both of us work in mental health as clinicians) started going through all of my neuropsychologicals and piecing  together all the symptoms (auditory processing disorder, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, internal ADHD, social phobia, depression, anxiety), plus the fact that my brother was diagnosed and my father and grandad also likely had it, that we found what others had missed...which happens a lot with girls, especially those cultured out due to being exposed to contingencies to aid in social circumstances.

I posted this in another forum recently:

Welp. Here we go.

Hans Aspergers was a pediatrician who worked with a wide variety of children. He did a lot of work prior to WW2 and conducted many studies regarding children who essentially were autistic.

During WW2 Hitler ordered the T4 Euthanasia program. Alongside the hundreds of thousands of Roma who were euthanized during the T4 program, those with autism were euthanized as well.

Enter Hans Aspergers. His work alongside the autistic community (essentially he coined the term autism), was very well known. As a pediatrician and psychiatrist his insight was utilized by the Third Reicht. While Eugenics was the underpinning of the war, Aspergers fought for the highly intelligent autistic community to be spared (Think: Sheldon, Bones, Einstein, me, etc..). These were those who had autism, yet were those highly functioning and yet while eccentric, were considered highly intelligent and should be spared.

Aspergers was seen as somewhat of a hero...until they later found that he had actually placed orders for people who were lower functioning to a particular facility which was known to be pseudonized for the T4 euthanasia camp.

In the last 10 years they merged Aspergers with Autism on the DSM5 (tool used when diagnosing mental neurodiversities). We no longer carry the name as his children."

A lot of times it’s used as a separation amongst classes, if you will, within the autistic community. Higher functioning vs lower functioning. And it really has roots dug in to the WW2 past, but also classism as far as diagnoses go between social statuses. 

For instance I was a military kid living in DC a good part of my youth. My mom was a social worker who worked in South East. As a kid in the 90s it was still a rarity to have ASD diagnoses, especially amongst females,  because they didn’t have the knowledge about the neurodiversity that we do now. However there was a much more plausible chance that a child in the Palisades would be diagnosed with Aspergers, while someone in South East would get diagnosed with Autism or even more likely MR/MID."

Point being, it's labor that makes the useful stuff for civilization to enjoy. Executives are, with a few rare exceptions, overpaid managers. They get to reap the majority of the profits made by the laborers because they had initial capital to invest and the employees didn't; simple as that. It's not a coincidence that Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, and other megabillionaires were already born into the 1% before they made a shitload of more money."

The history of autism has overwhelmingly showed, with decades of research and hands-on experience that the best way to help Autistic people integrate with our society is to identify them and provide community supports where they can make connections, learn to take care of themselves, and learn to hone their special skills. 

This is such a non-take in the 21st century, it's akin to anti-vax rhetoric or flat-earther logic."

While I currently teach fourth grade, I also work within the field of ABA. Research BCBAs, BCABAs, RBTs, etc for a better understanding. While my Masters is in Mathematics and Literacy, I have extensive post graduate coursework in ABA and have 1500 supervision hours completed to sit for BCBA credentialing in June. Again, if you’re interested in denouncing someone’s credentials please research behavior analysis and what those within that field do. Just because someone works in education doesn’t mean they aren’t doing tons of other shit/ working in additional fields concurrently. 

Autism and Aspergers are not diagnosed differently as it pertains to the DSM5. The ASD is a spectrum to the likes of a color wheel rather than being linear so it really doesn’t even make sense. The range of impact as well as range of ability varies so greatly, yet it is all under the umbrella of ASD."

2021-05-09 22:02:37,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for doing this - but I have some problems with the logic.

Certainly comparing PLTR to the other 'peers' on this list is sort of ridiculous - Given that PLTR's implementations take professional services, yet they are priced like a product.

You can sign up for OKTA, follow some tutorials, and implement it within your organization. You don't 'need' an OKTA administrator - anyone familiar with single sign on and active directory can implement OKTA.

SnowflakeDB is a big data product. It literally picks up where SQL leaves off and allows you to query hundreds of TB in seconds - it is in direct competition with Azure Synapse and Amazon Redshift. Both of which suck in a lot of ways. The key factor here is that snowflakedb doesn't need consultants and engineers so it is a PRODUCT.

Why is it bad that PLTR's products need consultants and engineers? Consulting services only get a multiple of 3x revenue in valuation of a company. PRODUCTS can get 30x. Because a product can be sold hundreds of times with 1 engineer, and a consulting service is usually around 3:1.

SO these government PLTR contracts - they are great and everything but until companies start buying a 'software product' from PLTR and not a 'multi year servicing contract' - they don't deserve the multiples they are receiving.

Now with innovative products like PLTR - there is certainly a chance that AWS/ Microsoft buys them out to integrate their software as a product into their pipeline, but i don't think it is likely - especially with all of the government red tape in the way."

2021-05-09 22:34:00,wallstreetbets,"Hey heapsp, I am a developer too so I pretty much just agree with you. This is just why PLTR was criticized a lot -- a consultant company who provides solutions. And to be honest, this approach is not scalable and that's why you only see Palantir 139 customers after 17 years on the market. The closest comparison for PLTR is just IBM but IBM is nearly not growing so there is no good comparison.  


But is PLTR changing? Well, I think it can be too early to conclude, but if you look at their health care and supply chain archetypes, they seem to be on the way to provide a platform for various industries rather than solutions. [https://www.palantir.com/double-click/files/Palantir%20Double%20Click%20-%20Transcript%20EN.pdf](https://www.palantir.com/double-click/files/Palantir%20Double%20Click%20-%20Transcript%20EN.pdf). It depends on how you define a product, is it a platform for engineers, or a application for business people?  


Palantir is unique in a way that it wants to provide a low-code/no-code environment, in an age that machine learning or big data engineers  are difficult to acquire. Palantir would like to compare itself with the MS windows OS, but for companies. Of course, you also have Linux, where most developers are using.  
But I just agreed with what you said, so I guess I'll wait and see what is coming for this company"
2021-05-10 02:14:08,wallstreetbets,"This sums it up nicely and what I've concluded about PLTR. It just doesn't scale like the other data analytics companies. Their main contracts will be government and they will have lots of trouble breaking into commercial, imo."
2021-05-09 22:38:42,wallstreetbets,"Still some red flags even in that recent PDF though - example: ""Our data engineers have already cleaned & linked it...""

Ok so PLTR's data engineers did the cleaning and linking of the data - wonderful. Don't get me wrong, that service is WONDERFUL and HIGHLY IN DEMAND - but if you need that to happen for your product to work then that is a red flag for me. In order to productize this - they would need the product to link directly to the data sets and automatically perform all of the linking to PLTR's proprietary model (or make it self service). I think they have a long way to go before this is truly a product.

My consulting company does roughly the same with competitive intelligence in the life science industry. Connecting and displaying competitive intelligence from a number of sources but it is HAND CRAFTED DATA and requires our engineers to be involved every step of the way. Don't get me wrong - revenue is great because that service is very in demand - but there's no way our company is valued at 30x revenue. 5x revenue is about where its at.

PLTR's YoY revenue increases are impressive though - at $15 a share I think it is fair and the investment is decently solid given the market."

2021-05-09 23:04:07,wallstreetbets,"Some positives are that this niche is very lacking. The big players in this space are just a nightmare hodge-podge of products that don't really do the job. Microsoft and Amazon have tried (unsuccessfully) to do what PLTR is doing - and we all know IBM is stepping aside. Someone has to fill in the gaps.

Microsoft has shown some interest in bettering their offerings here, with their 250mm investment in Databricks (at a 3 billion valuation - going off of memory). Databricks recent valuation in series g funding is a valuation of 30 billion(ish). databricks has 6k customers and less revenue than PLTR but they are purely a product and not really comparable because PLTR's platform is 'smart' and databricks is just a dumb platform that allows data scientists to do their own thing.

SO if the world has taught us anything in the past decade - its that company valuation doesn't really matter too much. Similar to TSLA - valuations can be out of this world if there is a clear front-runner in a growing industry.

What I'd like to see PLTR do for their shareholders is eventually have a third wing of their company - 1. Government 2. Consumer Professional Service 3. Self Service Product. They could snap up the huge market of users who don't want to pay millions of dollars per contract but still want a rich AI to analyze their data - it won't be as effective that way, but that is a PERFECT CROSS SALE to their professional services division!"
2021-05-09 23:14:08,wallstreetbets,">. Consumer Professional Service 3

I totally agreed.

Speaking of databricks, it's not public so it's hard to compare valuation. But Reynold Xin, co-founder of databricks, he is one of the key contributors to Palantir's spark distribution, in early days.

[https://github.com/palantir/spark/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/palantir/spark/graphs/contributors)

As for- 1. Government 2. Consumer Professional Service 3. Self Service Product.I think PLTR dominates 1 and 2, and Google just does not want to deal with the Army. But for 3), it could unleash the biggest potential, if PLTR executes it well for Apollo and those archetypes. They need to expand sales and better developer tutorials"

2021-05-09 20:35:51,wallstreetbets,"Example:

'MEOW' is currently trading at $100. You believe the price will go down to around $80 in ""A WEEK."" You buy 1 Put option for $85 (Strike Price) at the cost of $1 per option ($1 * 100 since 1 option = 100 stocks). 

You buy-to-open 1x $MEOW $85 P 05/14 for $1 ($100).

For each day that passes between the time you buy and expiration date, the price of the option is guaranteed to go down a bit (it can however go up more if the stock moves in your direction at a faster rate). Learn Greeks!

To break even, the price has to fall $84 ($85 - $1) by 05/14 AND you need to sell-to-close when the price reaches $84 by 05/14.

If the lowest price it reaches is $85, you will either sell-to-close at lower than the price you bought it at (if you wait too long, your sell price might be as low as $0.005, which is basically $0) and you loose $100.

To make profit, the price has to fall below $84 by 05/14 AND you need to sell-to-close when you are satisfied with your potential profit by 05/14. If the price falls to $80 on 05/13 at 1pm, you can quickly close-to-sell your option for at least $5 ($500) at that second and you make profit of $400 ($500 - $100). The price can move up to $87 by 1:01 pm and if you haven't closed your position and it doesn't go below $84 after that, you're out of luck.

What makes this play interesting is their JV interest in a large copper/gold development in Mongolia. The mining license is majority held by Turquoise Resources.  Rio Tinto is also involved.

To make things more interesting, Entree has large insider ownership between Sandstorm Gold (22%) Turquoise Hill (8%) and Rio Tinto (9%), as of February.  A bunch more insider buying has occurred and these numbers are higher (Sandstorm for sure)."

2021-05-10 03:49:24,wallstreetbets,"Most people, that have an investing interest in a company, care very little about whether or not they provide a meaningful benefit to the world. Investing is about making money, that's a given. The idea of investing in something that can save lives AND give a substantial return on investment, should be a no-brainer for everyone. Pharmaceutical stocks promise this regularly and rarely follow through. Inovio seems different. They have been working on several viable treatments for decades. The most recent reports suggest that their cancer vaccines are groundbreaking. Their DNA COVID-19 Phase 2 results are showing incredibly high efficacy with little to no side affects. They have a patented delivery system that is marketable on its own. In my humble opinion, this company seems like it will follow through. I have no relation to this company. I am not a financial advisor. I just wanted to share what I think about a company that I believe can make a difference going forward"

2021-05-10 01:40:47,wallstreetbets,I don’t think their covid vaccine is needle free. The paper the published on biorxiv says inject intradermally then electroporate.
2021-05-10 06:13:35,wallstreetbets,"Inovio in May just signed a deal with a Chinese company in Hong Kong to fund phase 3 and supply vaccine to mainland China.  They will get paid in the high single digits per shot.  Only 10 percent of their population is vaccinated since their people do not trust Chinese vaccines.

I had a reaction to one mRNA likely from PEG  continued within and will wait untila DNA booster of some variety is available.

I recently went for a new spiked antibody test and a person with 2 shots can get a score of 2.  My score was nearly 10 Wih one shot since I had natural Covid a year ago.  I am willing to wait and wear a mask inside stores for 2 years to avoid mRNA.

I believe with boosters  from mRNA  vaccines you will see many more adverse reactions and even fertility issues in women from syncytin 1  effects on placenta development.

I hope the cancer vaccines do not move to China and we have to pay them for what was invented here."

I think only the most significant 17 year one should be reported.

Pinterest is a freakin' gold mine for advertisers. Users literally post and explore the products, services, and projects/ideas they're interested in. That data is more valuable to businesses than what Facebook and and maybe even Google have in some ways. They also have great conversion metrics.

480M people used it last quarter. That's a whole lot, despite the slight AUM miss. Average revenue per user also saw solid growth.

I'm not concerned about AUM long-term. They have huge growth opportunity internationally. Additionally, they can grow their male user base if they expand on their male-oriented DIY efforts and other male-oriented hobbies. Personally, I think they should create a whole new brand for men."

2021-05-10 04:00:43,wallstreetbets,"This is pretty much the answer. Add in a budget, savings plan and a bit of time for compound interest."
2021-05-10 03:38:21,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it’s by the beach. Only 350 metres to be exact - on one of the most desirable beaches in all of the world actually and within easy reach of a capital city with an international airport. And everything else is absolutely true also. And to add to it, I’ve never earned over $100k in my entire life and I’ll be retired by the time I’m 50. I’m 41 now. Let me explain how it’s possible since you don’t seem to believe the other posters. I live in Australia. I have a wife. No kids (prob still would be possible though). Our household income is $140k. I’ve been saving at least $250 a week since I started working(in the defence force) at 17 yrs old - investing in ETFs and compound interest is key. I left the forces and have spent the past 20ish years working in charities. I’ve never owned more than one house at a time, but have benefited from property prices rises and gradually moving out of cities to regional coastal towns where house prices are lower. Most houses where I’ve lived have pools - it’s common in Australia. I put a hot tub in. The business class flights and 5 star holidays are purely down to collecting frequent flyer points (they’re genuinely a second income source if you do it right) - I’d recommend learning about churning credit cards. One thing I have benefited from is a thing called superannuation which a government mandate that my employer must put 9.5% of my salary into an account for my retirement which means I don’t have to worry about that financial part of my life. 

TLDR: I set a savings budget and let time and compound interest do the rest. Collect frequent flyers points and never pay for a holiday again. Get lucky with a progressive government policy."
2021-05-10 07:37:47,wallstreetbets,"Fair, I wasn't considering locations outside the US. I don't think this would be possible inside the US, but I was wrong."
2021-05-10 02:43:21,wallstreetbets,"I get what you're saying, but imagine taking out driving to the job (work from home) or that they are a teacher and a nurse. Income for those could easily be around 150k in the sticks. Ocean view houses in my town are like 300-500k and were only like 150 to 400k only a few years ago. These are not fancy, but meet the points he mentioned."
2021-05-10 09:03:16,wallstreetbets,"It’s definitely possible in most places if you’re middle class. All it comes down to is finding a job you enjoy and then life is a walk in the park. However to make it easier then definitely spend some time learning about budgets, compound interest (your best investment by far) and churning cards for frequent flyer points."

2021-05-10 17:33:53,wallstreetbets,I actually bought 15 contracts of a call when it hit 418 and set for a .09 gain. It hit that for a profit of $134 so both trades today profit of about $195. I just bought some calls when it hit 417.50ish seconds before market close waiting to see if hit will open higher tomorrow am 🤷🏼‍♂️
2021-05-10 17:34:43,wallstreetbets,Theta going to open those calls in the red probably though
2021-05-10 17:37:43,wallstreetbets,My thinking is that it will work up to 418 before open tomorrow so hoping it’s break even or somewhat profitable. Theres a gap between 417-418 that it closed so im thinking it will work its way up. The trendline i have shows it should be 419 or so if i am going bullish.

2021-05-10 01:17:11,wallstreetbets,"I just saw a vid that the FED was pretty much admitting that hedge funds are basically shorting everything.

They didn't say it so much in those words, but it's pretty much what they were saying. Makes sense being that there is more and more stocks in which I see the SI go up and only up. Most of them undeservedly. 

Typically, they will short a stock and when it starts to get too bullish they will cover some calls and get out. Seems they are doing the opposite. They're doubling down. 

Pretty nutz. They're playing a very dangerous game. I wonder if we're the reason why they are doing it."
2021-05-10 01:24:20,wallstreetbets,"The fed said they noted that hedge funds in particular are using very high leverage and buying many many puts and shorting many high valuation stocks. They're basically not caring if the particular stocks have good fundamentals. They're just shorting it and shorting it some more. I guess they feel that all these stocks are overvalued, but the problem is that if people know that those businesses are doing well, people are not going to sell. They're playing a very dangerous game. So, even the fed has noticed that good companies with good earnings are going down, because they are being attacked by hedge funds that are shorting them in a very aggressive way."

2021-05-10 11:19:48,wallstreetbets,"reverse stock split did not get approved by shareholders, if I recall the results after I voted the other month correctly.

Why is reverse stock splitting a ""bad"" sign?

Makes the stock more expensive, harder to buy in, making it traditionally have less volume and less volatile. huge boomer move.

Lastly, by making the stock price larger, it can be seen as an opportunity to give the company more space to devalue (aka, the board sees something ahead that could be a significant problem for the next 2-3 years). 

Either way i'm still holding for the long term, we've been stuck at this 13-14 price point for the past 3 months with resistence to pass below 13, there have been minor breakouts to push 14 so its only a matter of time.

2021-05-10 16:54:18,wallstreetbets,"Guess we can expect much less revenue in q2 from 205bps gain margin to “We anticipate second quarter production to be in the $51-$55 billion range, with expected gain margin between 75 and 110 bps.”

Maybe here market is reacting on downside. Maybe will add more shares tomorrow. Bought today 1500 more shares to total tally of 4500 shares with average price of 7.32"
2021-05-10 00:59:27,wallstreetbets,I’m holding. I like to sell way OTM calls during price spikes and then get more share.
2021-05-10 13:15:48,wallstreetbets,"Solid, raiding my kids piggy bank for more shares as we speak..."
2021-05-10 13:52:34,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget. In response to RKT issuing a $1.11 special dividend, UWMCs CEO came out and stated in their next earnings they are going to strongly look at issuing a special dividend or a quarterly dividend increase! That next earnings is TODAY!"
2021-05-10 16:34:03,wallstreetbets,"Well, go figure, if I'm reading the Q1 report right, UWMC beats earnings estimates by 6 cents a share but can't come close to Q4, so after hours traders are...currently punishing the stock, it's down another 12 cents as I type.  We can call that sideways I guess with the volatility, but it's basically what I predicted, if they didn't beat Q4, it wasn't going to recover. Which makes no damn sense, but this stonk doesn't make any sense. 

But hey, we still get that 10 cent dividend!

Guess I get to keep averaging down into the foreseeable future."
2021-05-10 19:25:53,wallstreetbets,I told myself i wouldnt buy more of this but i averaged down today. Will it go lower? I'm thinking of buying more now.
2021-05-10 01:46:50,wallstreetbets,Link?
2021-05-10 10:22:23,wallstreetbets,I wonder if Mat is going to come out as a bipolar fraud CEO that was faking it until he made it. Something fishy is definitely going on here. I’m hoping for a ridiculous rally.  My ulcer is on fire.
2021-05-10 11:10:01,wallstreetbets,"As I said on Friday. No questions asked at this point. I sold another batch of puts. I'm ready to acquire this company and take it private, off the market."
2021-05-10 15:57:07,wallstreetbets,Your kids will thank you.
2021-05-10 17:04:03,wallstreetbets,How much is it ?
2021-05-10 16:50:32,wallstreetbets,Have you read about share buybacks?
2021-05-10 19:27:08,wallstreetbets,I was going to buy more today as well but got stuck with PayPal and can’t sell it now. 🤡
2021-05-10 14:55:11,wallstreetbets,"Predictions?  We're getting close, I'm gonna go ahead and make my smooth brain predictions you 100% should put zero stock in.

If EPS misses by 1 to 2 cents, the stock trades sideways as I think the miss got priced in when Rocket missed by a penny.

If EPS misses by more than 2 cents, the stock will decline exponentially based on the size of the miss.

Now, for the big sad prediction, I think if it goes anywhere from a miss of 1 to 2 cents, all the way to 62 cents per share, it still trades sideways because for whatever reason, the market just hates this SPAC stonk.

It'll have to beat Q4 earnings to actually go up, because the long term outlook for mortgages is coupled with a lot of FUD regarding interest rates and uncertainty with inflation, so it'll have to crush to go up.

I'm probably just cynical because I've been averaging down for months, and I keep watching this value stock just gain more value...by doing down in price :P

Again, all my opinion, I have no clue what I'm talking about, I'm a dumb-ass smooth brain ape. Flame me now please."
2021-05-10 15:53:11,wallstreetbets,This is where I'm at. Shorties are doing me a favor as far as I'm concerned.
2021-05-10 16:53:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, pretty non-committal.  $300m over the next 24 months and they can decide not to at their discretion."
2021-05-10 03:51:50,wallstreetbets,"Got nutcases speculating another crash caused by MBS as RKT  are doing retarded lending again

Possible theory for the lack of valuation"
2021-05-10 14:05:43,wallstreetbets,"Aren't a lot (most?) of those mountains of mortgages locked in at current, ultra-low rates though? Or are people still financing with ARM's even after the 2008 debacle? Not a rhetorical question, genuinely curious."
2021-05-10 15:07:30,wallstreetbets,"If you are worried about earning beat, then you think UWMC lost 1/3 of their business from last quarter, this is impossible in this hot market and it seems like UWMC had better quarter than its competitors.

I assume UWM will have higher loan volume at 55B-58B but margin will be lower around 230-240 bps. It should be enough to crush the estimate.

The future guidance will dictate price movement though not Q1 earnings. UWMC has been selling their potential Q2 explosion so that's why I'm bullish not because earnings beat.

All my guess BTW."
2021-05-10 15:57:28,wallstreetbets,In a sense they are blessing us.
2021-05-10 15:40:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the IV shows this stonk is gonna move 20.4% on the Earnings news, I'm sure keeping my fingers crossed that that move is in the direction of the sun."
2021-05-10 16:40:27,wallstreetbets,"Interesting UWM is projecting expected gain margin between 75 and 110 bps for Q2, sounds pretty low.. What are your thoughts now?"
2021-05-10 16:48:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah future margin decline is much steeper than I expected. Long-term holders shouldn't worry with dividend and wholesale channel growth. But short-term holders only have share buyback to look forward to.

$300M share buyback is 40%+ of float at current price. Obviously that's not happening all at once. However, buyback start date is tomorrow. With conference call tomorrow morning, we will find out more.. until then hope to weather this out AH and PM then check back tomorrow morning."
2021-05-10 16:42:51,wallstreetbets,"How are you feeling now? Gain on sale projections under 100 bps for 2021Q2, all lower numbers when compared to 2020."
2021-05-10 17:17:03,wallstreetbets,"I think today was the day to close your puts for profit. It didn’t drop AH like RKT or LDI

I think the buyback is the reason it’s not going to dip below 6"
2021-05-10 16:49:55,wallstreetbets,They dip. I buy. All the way to $0. Simple as that. I'll end up owning the largest wholesale mortgage lender in the US.
2021-05-10 17:37:25,wallstreetbets,I think a lot of this was already priced in given that it’s down over 15% since the RKT earnings announcement so couldn’t drop as much after hours. I’m planning to get out and take my 80% profit tomorrow at open.
2021-05-10 09:46:39,wallstreetbets,Closed out at just over 8.5% gain. Apes have my full support to do as they do now
2021-05-10 09:44:42,wallstreetbets,Closed out at 2.5% gain... :)
2021-05-10 09:27:56,wallstreetbets,Oops... I’m up 8.43% pre market “chasing waterfalls”
2021-05-10 10:52:47,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the response 

I managed to exit some of my positions today at a modest profit - realized it was beyond my risk tolerance despite the stock looking like absolute garbage on a technical standpoint. The earnings report comes out today and I do not want to be burned by it again haha. The only thing now is not to room back in when it falls past 30."
2021-05-10 05:34:14,wallstreetbets,You mean 💰 🙌 since we actually sold for a profit
2021-05-10 17:48:27,wallstreetbets,lol i love her  vids
2021-05-09 21:21:11,wallstreetbets,👍🏾🦍❤️
2021-05-09 23:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Man, i didnt know what i was getting into when I held through 40 but no matter what its been a hell of a ride"
2021-05-10 16:52:15,wallstreetbets,u/SaveVideo
2021-05-10 05:37:08,wallstreetbets,"No it was us trying to be Wall Street until you guys ruined out sub. Oh btw, most Wall Street firms in gme profited immensely"
2021-05-10 05:34:49,wallstreetbets,No and it never was
2021-05-10 05:39:56,wallstreetbets,This is amazing. You aren’t even aware of fractional shares existing and can’t even dish out $160 for a share so you bought into an even dumber stock. Lmao
2021-05-10 18:39:27,wallstreetbets,Holy frijole was BE beat down today
2021-05-09 22:19:25,wallstreetbets,"@Nrdrage, curious what was the reason you filled out your BABA calls pre earnings given recent activity?"
2021-05-10 01:44:28,wallstreetbets,sTill in BB long term?
2021-05-10 08:40:26,wallstreetbets,Could you maybe do a post or comment to me what your thoughts on the great winners of 5G are your predictions to be and why? I would be very interested.
2021-05-10 12:49:53,wallstreetbets," Curious if you're still in KMI, doing great things today.

Edit: somehow missed #14. Enjoy the tendies!"
2021-05-10 14:22:38,wallstreetbets,Assume you are still a believer in rwcey?
2021-05-10 18:22:44,wallstreetbets,"I know it’s not on either of your lists but have you given thought about dabbling in LMND? It got the beat down today, so I finally jumped in. Hopefully won’t be regretting it."
2021-05-10 18:56:26,wallstreetbets,Hoping PTON is back on the short menu soon
2021-05-10 16:18:16,wallstreetbets,"Don't get discouraged by fuckers trying to make money on your internet good name(lol at that concept), i love reading your stuff and hope you keep at it for a long time."
2021-05-10 01:07:11,wallstreetbets,People are fuckin nuts lmao
2021-05-10 14:39:14,wallstreetbets,I think BABA will be just fine.  You should be in the green by then.
2021-05-10 18:41:58,wallstreetbets,"Ev got crushed because of wkhs numbers.

So of course a company that doesn't make vehicles and isn't electric in nature goes down with them"
2021-05-10 00:36:40,wallstreetbets,What’s the reason you’re looking to buy these pre earnings?
2021-05-10 15:18:34,wallstreetbets,YOU SPOKE TOO SOON.
2021-05-10 18:26:02,wallstreetbets,"I scalp it, but I don't talk about it"
2021-05-10 16:08:10,wallstreetbets,Take my upvote for your well placed meat-smoking analogies.
2021-05-10 14:49:54,wallstreetbets,Sigh.   Here's hoping!  I do think this is a tremendous buy at this point!
2021-05-10 19:36:08,wallstreetbets,It's beyond me how BE trades in sympathy with the others. When they really have nothing in common.
2021-05-10 15:19:04,wallstreetbets,It's a bad habit I have.
2021-05-10 14:54:45,wallstreetbets,"If it heads lower i will also consider buying shares. I need to see $200 to go in for shares. If we get there I will buy shares. If not, sticking with options."
2021-05-10 09:27:46,wallstreetbets,You make it sound simple so they’ll definitely fuck it up
2021-05-10 10:52:50,wallstreetbets,Looking like time to get back in APPH?  It’s basically back at its low from the last dip.
2021-05-10 10:54:31,wallstreetbets,"I'm watching it, but I'm not buying in in this environment.  Too much risk of giving the tendies I took from it a couple weeks ago back"
2021-05-10 11:11:57,wallstreetbets,What happened to BE? 10% down today?
2021-05-10 11:05:20,wallstreetbets,Makes sense. I decided to start slowly easing my way into some August calls and hope I won’t regret that.
2021-05-10 11:14:23,wallstreetbets,Machines say green energy goes down.  Gotta love market manipulation
2021-05-10 11:19:30,wallstreetbets,these CLNE june 13 calls are really not fun too look at
2021-05-10 12:16:35,wallstreetbets,"After enough people say 'fuck it, I'm not putting my life's earnings into the financial roulette wheel of algorithms', I wonder how the media will cover for their overlords.  ""Volume cratering due to domestic terrorism""?  ""Volume cratering due to day traders""?  I'm really curious.  

My favorite thing to do for work is fundamental analysis, I love figuring out what the 'story' for any company is.  I love figuring out how to operationalize that into a working model, and then tinkering with different scenarios to see what the output is.  It's like getting to solve a jigsaw puzzle every day.  

This market is making me question if it's worth sticking in the field long-term.  It makes ZERO difference what the story is, if it's playing out, if it's even *better*, etc.  You can have 5%-10% drops in a name based on .001% of the daily volume.  Granted, it was like that 10 years ago as well, but it just seems so...prevalent...now.  Ther market itself seems to be getting carried by 15 or 20 names, which have been vaccuuming up smaller companies for a couple decades now...the connection is gone now.  Everything just moves on manipulation.


BE is a great example, I saw this:           

>Options trading at 10:55 a.m. New York time totaled 17,655 contracts, vs average of 1,673. Calls reached 2,179 contracts on open interest of 60,696. Puts reached 15,476 contracts on open interest of 66,957.   

No news from the company, just a 11x option volume massively favoring puts, and the equity drops 10% for no reason.  Nope, nothing to see here.  Hope you didn't do a ton of research on the name before putting cash into our financial casino kiddies!"
2021-05-10 11:32:21,wallstreetbets,Down 72%.
2021-05-10 11:37:01,wallstreetbets,bought a sh\*t load more today...averaged down to .49 from .90
2021-05-10 11:57:13,wallstreetbets,cant help but be a bit frustrated to see it drop right back down
2021-05-10 11:39:07,wallstreetbets,They hurt
2021-05-10 13:08:02,wallstreetbets,"I rolled mine awhile back. Honestly probably going to shift into selling PMCCs here pretty soon.

2021-05-10 17:14:51,wallstreetbets,Upper managers too ossified to figure out how to.manage people they can't breath onion bagel breath on up close. The only worry i have about working at home is what is stopping them from firing me and hiring 5 people in Kathmandu for cheaper. They outsourced the hell out of customer support because it is possible.. Well now what else is possible?
2021-05-10 11:36:23,wallstreetbets,yup
2021-05-10 14:05:45,wallstreetbets,Oh look at that. Red again. 😂
2021-05-10 14:07:01,wallstreetbets,its honestly just stupid at this point
2021-05-10 14:37:09,wallstreetbets,yeah. completely retarded
2021-05-10 06:36:30,wallstreetbets,"20-60 miles?

Yeah, I call bullshit.

Maybe the 20 miles.. maybe. Over an hour on the bike isn't a crazy crazy thought, but as a warmup? sure..... but 60 miles? nah bro. you didn't put 3-4 hours on the bike 5-6 times a week as a warmup to working out."
2021-05-10 06:36:54,wallstreetbets,Minutes
2021-05-10 06:45:22,wallstreetbets,"I see there still 185K in shares, still in game!"
2021-05-10 11:05:38,wallstreetbets,Im in with you fellow retard.
2021-05-10 10:19:37,wallstreetbets,Well the company IPOed in its strongest year. That reveals a lot about them. Disc. Had 100 RKT booked loss and got out.
2021-05-10 10:36:23,wallstreetbets,Please update us your loss porn today May 10th.
2021-05-10 16:57:25,wallstreetbets,What is causing it ?
2021-05-10 10:55:38,wallstreetbets,"Damn! 185k shares, think you're the biggest position I've heard of. What's your cost average?"
2021-05-10 12:31:56,wallstreetbets,Let's prove the world wrong brother.💪💪💪
2021-05-10 14:24:37,wallstreetbets,Dude....weren't you the one that was all in on GME and sold like a day later? I can't believe I'm saying this but put money in VTI and let it breathe for a bit.
2021-05-10 11:17:23,wallstreetbets,Is this an actual question or rhetorical?
2021-05-10 11:32:49,wallstreetbets,Woah Woah... I do the same thing in my retirement account.
2021-05-10 12:15:21,wallstreetbets,"Wow, you are a D-bag. I don't need or want your sympathy. You think there aren't new investors, fathers/ mothers that are down on their money too? I'm posting for them, not for you. You think there weren't GME supporters brigading and shitting on RKT threads? People like you are the reason I left GME. Disgusting."
2021-05-10 12:21:08,wallstreetbets,I've been offered lube after the fact...
2021-05-10 12:19:21,wallstreetbets,"I don't think that fair, they've been growing every year, so literally any year they IPOed would have been it's strongest year. They didn't IPO right before the Housing crash and they'd been in business well before then, so it's not like they IPO because they are expecting doom and gloom to come."
2021-05-10 12:22:45,wallstreetbets,"ahaha, too soon man, can't be flooding the sub with YOLO updates every time the market swings."
2021-05-10 11:08:43,wallstreetbets,"Nah Bro, I mean that you have still 185K cash in this shares :D sorry for misunderstanding!
P.S Today I will go in but only for max 1k shares"
2021-05-10 12:41:18,wallstreetbets,Bro wtf this shit keeps going down. I hope we can at least close the gap from earnings. Markets are basically ignoring all the profit and earnings since the company went ipo. And when are the owners going to start that 1 billion share buyback program? I think its time.
2021-05-10 14:28:47,wallstreetbets,"Lol yeah that was a mistake but i am not selling this time. Diamond hands, learned my lesson from gme. Had i held, it reversed completely the next day."
2021-05-10 16:14:50,wallstreetbets,"Bro, make sure you manage your risk wisely. Live to fight another day. Put a stoploss and if it hit, move on."
2021-05-10 11:19:02,wallstreetbets,Rhetorical.  Pray for you to turn a profit.
2021-05-10 12:29:21,wallstreetbets,I can agree to that! :-)
2021-05-10 12:28:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man, losses punch me in the gut too. I usually set a timer for like 15 min, meditate and clear my mind and think about the best move going forward. Do I still like the stock? Are my reasons for buying still there? Are the reasons for the drop valid? Do I really just suck ass and should I stop trading/investing altogether? That's all you can do, make the best decision going forward and not dwell on the past. And of course, never risk money you can't afford to lose. Nothin is for sure in the market."
2021-05-10 13:54:04,wallstreetbets,"yeah, but who knows what the premiums were when they were originally sold. Just like GME, they were selling those calls for pennies...until it blew up in their face. I also have a theory that the banks want to keep the stock down because if it goes up and they use the stock to acquire another Fintech, then they would eat up the market share of the mortgages/personal loans/ auto loans from the banks. At the end of the day, cash is king, and they print money so I'm not worried long term."
2021-05-10 13:07:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I think they'll slowly start doing that. Looking at the chart, I think the stock is held down because Apes jump on and started buying calls, so they keep the price down to prevent the calls from paying out. If you look at the IPO, the price moved pretty freely, then at some point it started being constrained."
2021-05-10 14:30:44,wallstreetbets,"Just FYI, I do not mean to sound like I'm making fun of you. I just remember because I tried to find the post and couldn't anymore. I had wanted to send some words of encouragement since I remember you were talking about feeling like throwing up. My concern did not translate well with my original post. Good luck with this stuff. I hope it works out for you."
2021-05-10 11:15:45,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, seems like that, but it's not like the stock was a high flyer to begin with. And the company has already proven that they are profitable in a high interest rate environment, and they even stated in the call what 50% of their products isn't affected by interest rates?

The print so much money I think they might just buy back the float and go private just to not have to deal with the bullshit."
2021-05-10 14:05:56,wallstreetbets,"Once and if you get to breakeven, are you selling or are you holding for longer term? Whats your time frame horizon?"
2021-05-10 13:12:50,wallstreetbets,But the premium on it is so low. I just wrote my first covered call this week and it was almost not worth writing it. It was for a call for 22.50 strike and the premium is peanuts.
2021-05-10 14:35:48,wallstreetbets,"Thanks very much. At the end of the day, its just money. And I can make it back, I'm 35 with a decent job.
I deleted the post because at the time and even now, WSB was very gungho on GME so selling GME and posting the loss was in retrospect a bad idea. I got a lot of nasty comments/DMs and i unsubbed from wsb. I just come on here for confirmation bias now lol. And yeah, i could post loss porn on rkt or pltr but not going through those mental comments and replies. Good luck with your trades!"
2021-05-10 14:30:36,wallstreetbets,"I'll be holding a portion long term and just monitoring how the company does and it's growth strategy. I'll be keeping an eye out for other opportunities as well, I don't mind taking a loss if I see a better opportunity, I just haven't seen any right now. To be fair, I haven't really done any research either. One day at a time."

2021-05-09 20:13:35,wallstreetbets,"Dude, was a typo.  You knew what I meant.

Not talking out of my ass.  I work for a hospital in a position where I would know what we are selling.

Your comment was that ""all healthcare data is controlled and sold in the US.""  

What data do you think is being collected?  Because trust me, they aren't selling the fact that you had an STD and you got a penicillin shot in your ass that day.  Hell, my hospital can barely get its EMR to operate correctly, much less worry about selling that data to the highest bidder.

The Insurance Co's have a LOT of data - it wouldn't shock me at all if they were selling it.  

But I'm truly interested in what data you think a hospital is going to be selling?"
2021-05-10 10:14:19,wallstreetbets,"> exercise after expiry?

No.

What part of 'expire' do you not understand?"
2021-05-09 21:40:10,wallstreetbets,"So are you in a position where you would even know what hospital data network your location is in? Premier for example is about half of the hospitals in the united states. When they resell the data, the datasets cost hundreds of thousands of dollars... That is precisely what the data contains - 30-40 year old male, indication, treatment (including drug), hospital location, etc. Ask someone in the know if that hospital is in the premier data network."

2021-05-10 15:31:51,wallstreetbets,"Next quarter - I checked with an analyst at a large bank. They book only once the stay has occured. In other words it's going to be a shit earning this week.

WORST from the 14th of May every investors who were in a lock up due to the IPO will be allowed to sell creating a shit load of selling pressure on the stock.

I was interested in the idea at first, but did my DD: summer bookings meaningless for this quarter + selling pressure = fuck this am out. Maybe in a month or two, but today is a death sentence to get in this one."

2021-05-10 10:04:33,wallstreetbets,"they may do something like Kazatomprom did with Cameco and inkai in kazakhstan where it changed from 60% owner to 40% equity interest.

This has to happen in countries like this as they are part of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. That's why this situation is funny because the market is trading this like a 100% total loss of those assets. when first of all there is no push currently to take it, the news release stipulates a management change if the company breaks rules which they currently are not. Lets say worse case scenario they do expropriate a further 20-30%, centerra will receive something for that however the game being played here is can the government take more on a mine that will likely run out at the end of this decade.... can the government take more ""value"" then the potential damage to their CG stake (they are centerras largest shareholder with 77 million shares + 27%) and further can they extract more value out of the mine for the country over the remaining LoM then the potential value of cooperating and having the CG shares go up in value.

I think the answer for anyone with even half a brain is obvious. $[CG.to](https://CG.to) $CGAU CGAU CG"
2021-05-09 20:43:01,wallstreetbets,"Honest question  

as per Bloomberg, 05 April, 2021 % ownership of shares:  Tutes own 121.07%, Insiders own 8.64%, Individuals own 7.52%

So, 137% of total shares....  

SI 14.55%

Where's the rest of the shares?

37% are outstanding that at that moment had not been covered... couldn't have been  22% of shares unaccounted for....   18M shares????

as I said earlier... garbage in = garbage out

Someone is not being truthful.  How can a Bloomberg be trusted when they are publishing obviously incorrect data?   Now perhaps they have no control over the  data-in, but then they should NOT be publishing it at all.....  they are complicit in the ruse"
2021-05-10 01:04:04,wallstreetbets,"A lot of institutional data is from filings they report and that can easily overlap which causes ownership above 100% of float.

Also, Bloomberg's data is from *THE* source ie exchange. The terminal is priced way beyond the retailer so they gain nothing from falsifying data there. It's a product meant for HFs and institutions."

They basically made a racing, shooter and open world game with Cyberpunk 2077, have trust in the studio that they belong to one of the top game developers. So PE is about 14 now compared to 32 for ATVI for example. It might take a little while, but I think there is potential!"

I still see some people play Pokemon GO, so this might be a steady revenue-stream with how many seem to enjoy The Witcher - and kinda free publicity with the netflix series, season 2 coming later this year.

Just looking at their financial statement, I don't think CDPR is going to die anytime soon at least."

I agree with your original post. What scares me more is that, even after cdpr fixes the hot mess that is currently cyberpunk, they might call it a day without introducing any of the proper features. Content is simply missing, and most of the current side content is as bland as it can be. Even if the game runs perfectly, it is still an empty shell of a game."

it adds up!

$9.5 million times $.02 is ~$190k, less than half of the $10 commission. That means retailers keep way more money in their pockets.

If you really think a $.4 bid/ask is flying, then set a limit order and you get the same result as $.02."
2021-05-10 17:50:53,wallstreetbets,"Foreclosures are starting to pop back up on the market.  Since banks have not been allowed to legally foreclose on properties during covid, the supply not only went down, the low priced supply went down.  I suspect there will be a plethora of foreclosures by the end of summer across the country which would depress prices.  Higher interest rates would also mean cheaper houses as the same monthly payment would be less principal to pay.  Once the foreclosures hit the market I suspect we see a quick 10% drop in values."

2021-05-10 00:45:57,wallstreetbets,"Listen, I hope you'll forgive me, because this is going to be harsh.  But you *need* to hear this, whether you want to or not.  You've shown yourself to be thoughtful and open-minded, and frankly I like you.  That's why I'm going to be blunt with you.

When you say you worry about ""those people"" and not yourself, you really need to wake up and realize that you *are* ""those people"".  Why do I say that?  Because of your own words.  You're creative, you have all these ideas, you want to be able to use them to help people even if they don't succeed, etc.  Yet by your own words you admit that all this ""creating and producing "" through 7 projects over 15 years have amounted to nothing.  I know that you worked hard on them, that they have value and meaning to you, that you believe in the potential of them to help people. But the market is the ultimate judge of what's valuable.  People buy goods and services because they value them more than the cash in their pocket.  It helps them and enriches their lives, whether it's a pair of shoes, a workout routine, or a movie they rent.  Every one of these bring more value to them than the money they exchanged for it.

You said ""Adults that work minimum wage and who have no creative faculty and/or desire to turn ideas into tangible projects will be the hardest hit when AI is implemented.""  Guess what?  That *is* you.  If after 15 years you haven't been able to find a way to turn any of these projects into a successful business it's an indication that people don't want what you've created.  Now I recognize there are other factors like marketing, funding, etc. but ultimately that's the truth.  If people aren't eager to give you their money it means they dont think they're getting any value out of what you created.  It's that simple.  As a thought experiment, what's the difference between someone who has ""no creative faculty and/or desire to turn ideas into tangible projects"" and someone who does have creative faculties and desires but can't make them profitable?  They both end up the same.

I'm not trying to be a jerk.  It would be so much easier for me just to walk away.  But you're such a damned nice guy who's so open-minded that I feel compelled to tell you what you can't see.  I want you to succeed, but you really need to understand that your estimation of yourself is not realistic.  

If I've offended you, I'm truly sorry and I won't say another word."

2021-05-10 14:13:04,wallstreetbets,"F. could've saved that $1,035 on commissions if you went with the beloved Robinhood (crappier execution times though)"
2021-05-10 13:52:50,wallstreetbets,"Correct,  but also important thing here was vaccination which was given out without any IP attached to it so it could have been mass produced."
2021-05-10 15:19:52,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't count on China to be responsible when it comes to environmental protections.  I don't know much about hydrogen production.
2021-05-10 08:34:57,wallstreetbets,Her reaction is so great!!
2021-05-10 08:39:53,wallstreetbets,"As a vegetarian -- love their products. Feel like their ice cream is very underrated as a catalyst for this stock. It's really good, they're not *just* a creamer brand."
2021-05-10 16:02:34,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree. I've tried many non-dairy ice cream out there, and Oatly's is the best so far. Their brand premium and loyalty is also underrated, at least with my observations. Even with other oat milk brands, seems like many consumers only buy them when Oatly is sold out."

2021-05-10 02:50:59,wallstreetbets,"close to zero...every app listed in the Apple store would have to stick strictly to the IOS guidelines.  
In this case, it has already approved by IOS team. Which means they have the license to operate their App within ""restricted regions"".  
\*Btw, it is way harder to Convince IOS to list your app on their store compared to google store as they are 10x stricter\*   
Which means SKLZ has already produce their licensed before they can be listed.  


when you say ""would IOS take a cut of their revenue?"" I assume you meant the 30% in-app purchase\~ the 30% in-app purchase ( **3.1.1 In-App Purchase:** ) doesn't apply to them as they fall under a different category. ( **5.3 Gaming, Gambling, and Lotteries** ) All this you can view it from **App store Review Guidelines**.  


The only reason why they can be banned is if they break any of the major rules which is to include malware, hacking, illegal data tracking etc.. which any apps in the app store has the same odds of been taken down.  


I have been managing app publishing space for years and listed different kinds of apps related to gambling/gaming mixed as well as speak to the IOS team regularly. However, i am unsure why they aren't on google playstore which is supposedly way easier to get in."
2021-05-10 09:48:43,wallstreetbets,just gone in to average down to 18... ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
2021-05-10 14:01:52,wallstreetbets,How is the situation with SKLZ different than what happened with Epic games?
2021-05-10 03:59:53,wallstreetbets,"I am not sure, maybe they have just flown under apple's radar."
2021-05-10 10:20:33,wallstreetbets,I just bought 2k more in shares at $14.90. Just waiting for the reversal which I hope is this week. Insane people are still selling at these levels
2021-05-09 23:08:46,wallstreetbets,"Like it matters. College is for liberal pussies that want to be brainwashed and can’t make a decision for themselves to save their lives. Unless you’re gonna be a dr or lawyer, it’s a huge waste of time and money.

I got 78 credit hours and no degree, said fuck that shit and jumped jobs 3 times after 6-9mo to gather Cybersecurity skills. With skills and certs it landed me a decent 6 figure job to get ahead, then started investing AND YOLOing. Gonna clear $400k easy this year off job and stonk trades, and another few million when I sell my bitcorns."
2021-05-10 16:09:11,wallstreetbets,You mean the Citadel building one? Or the one before that?
2021-05-10 16:24:22,wallstreetbets,"Both now that you ask. What does Citadel own WSB now? It was amazing that we kind of flew under the radar. Now, this is fucked"
2021-05-10 01:25:51,wallstreetbets,"U suck as a mod. I got money and coins... I'm NOT a spammer! Ban ME Ban ME I'll trim your hedge... If you were a good boy, you'd get an award from my rich ass."
2021-05-10 01:26:42,wallstreetbets,"I'll pay to ""spam."" You're a lame ass. Stop me. I'll get you banned. Banned from all flights, international AND domestic..."
2021-05-10 16:41:43,wallstreetbets,"It was a joke from the mods. Everybody was accusing them of being paid off by Citadel so they went ahead and just changed the banner.

I personally thought it was pretty funny."
2021-05-10 16:42:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah with over 10 million subscribers, it’s probably true. Which is actually far from funny. The little guys gathering together to make money. Yeah that game is over."
2021-05-10 16:49:45,wallstreetbets,Oh. You actually believe this shit. Nevermind.
2021-05-10 16:58:34,wallstreetbets,The amount for gain porn on here... you don’t think these big institutions are using our data to make their moves? 🤔🤔
2021-05-10 17:48:09,wallstreetbets,"I’m not sure I buy that management is buying in. $Bx added a short position this month and filings show major dumps by C-level management —might not be large amounts but with current trade volume it’s enough to depress the stock. I saw Citadel also has a short position. 

I do agree TAM is getting bigger with home insurance and selling solar. Current reps are selling solar but $vvnt is currently not installing or servicing these accounts and doesn’t look like $Bx is giving them the green light to do so either. At the low market cap and $Bx hesitant to support solar growth could there be a consolidation play with $run or $all? Maybe. 

Q1 reporting this week and I’m looking for signals that new businesses are being fast tracked with support from the board and of course cash flow improving and debt being restructured or paid down."
2021-05-10 17:58:00,wallstreetbets,"Also, I expect $vivint to announce a dealer program either this quarter, but no later then Q3. Traditionally $vvnt has only sold through their own reps —true even when selling in bestbuy. Dealer program should add 15-25% more accounts that will have a lower RMR because they are security only, but servicing costs are lower (catch 22 of a broad product portfolio). 

A fair amount of good things in the future but hard to see movement if the company can’t get more investor interest and not have C-levels and other insiders from dumping their position."
2021-05-10 00:54:23,wallstreetbets,40% Short interest
2021-05-10 00:53:20,wallstreetbets,How long until it squeezes ?
2021-05-10 11:37:11,wallstreetbets,"Im up %1400 on my calls. Of all the things, it would be boring steel. This isn't on any retail radar, still so much potential."
2021-05-10 06:46:38,wallstreetbets,U
2021-05-10 06:46:45,wallstreetbets,U
2021-05-10 06:47:49,wallstreetbets,Yes Sir
