2021-04-11 19:49:32,wallstreetbets,I’d still vote you as a top memer of this sub. There’s lots of great ones on here elsewhere too. Yours always have me cracking the fuck up though. The Boys one you did was hilarious. However the visual bot shit takes the gold lmao.

2021-04-11 19:15:57,wallstreetbets,"Yes, hahaha, I up voted if it's any consolation."
2021-04-11 19:21:40,wallstreetbets,"We had the choice.  We had some concerns initially, then at some point in the year it was not worth switching"
2021-04-11 19:20:09,wallstreetbets,"Oddly enough, when I described people complaining about transitions, I noticed those were screwed when I rendered it.  I thought it was ironic that way 🤷🏻‍♂️"
2021-04-11 19:23:03,wallstreetbets,Makes sense. Especially if it’s working out better just let it ride
2021-04-11 19:24:55,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I like it. I was just riffing off one of the lines you wrote to try and be funny."

2021-04-11 18:55:36,wallstreetbets,"APHA Q1 will disappoint. Canadian rec sales have been flat and heavily affected by covid store shutdowns and strained supply chains. I would be shocked to see good numbers, and this is from a APHA bull. Take the opportunity to buy the dip, but expect a story around covid and core customers halting buying to rationalize over-assorted inventory"

2021-04-11 19:05:49,wallstreetbets,He should exercise 69% of his options. He deserves some profit so he can repair his time machine and go home.
2021-04-11 18:36:12,wallstreetbets,Can someone less stupid than me explain what this would mean?

2021-04-11 18:33:07,wallstreetbets,Praying this poll ends with “exercising” at 69%

2021-04-11 18:23:48,wallstreetbets,"So he's sells all and makes a shit ton. Or he exercises all sets up a possible squeeze and ALL his shares increase in value.

Value play would seem to be exercise.

Or am I wrong??"
2021-04-11 19:59:39,wallstreetbets,Definitely sell the fucking contracts. I’m appalled you all would ask this man to throw away that much money even after he owns 100k shares.

2021-04-11 18:14:36,wallstreetbets,"No clue, what should I vote for?"

2021-04-11 18:34:37,wallstreetbets,Drive that price down pls.
2021-04-11 18:44:53,wallstreetbets,This is making me lose respect for him. What is he trying to gain by asking the masses what he should do? He's literally never done this before. This is just making it clear that this is just a game to him and his current position is nothing but play money.
2021-04-11 19:28:31,wallstreetbets,this guy is a god lol

2021-04-11 19:02:31,wallstreetbets,he is going to sell some and exercise the rest if the stock if the stock keeps going down.

2021-04-11 19:40:51,wallstreetbets,Serious question. Can someone please explain why he WOULD NOT exercise all? Don’t they expire soon?

2021-04-11 19:57:25,wallstreetbets,What happens if he exercises his option?
2021-04-11 19:01:25,wallstreetbets,"Don’t exercise.     
Sell the call options. Let the other person exercise, and use your newly acquired gains to buy the shares yourself."

2021-04-11 19:22:24,wallstreetbets,I love how in one of his YouTube intro he says him and his family are average people and he doesn't make a lot of money.  Yet he was able to buy these many shares and contracts early on before all this shit started.   Hmmm

2021-04-11 19:53:56,wallstreetbets,There is literally never a reason to early exercise. Just sell the contracts if you don’t want them anymore.

2021-04-11 18:36:01,wallstreetbets,holy hell
2021-04-11 18:50:05,wallstreetbets,"""Exercise all"" would mean DFV would buy 50,000 shares at an insane discount ($12/share) using the contracts he had bought last year. These contracts expire on Friday.

Most likely, the broker has already purchased these shares for DFV in anticipation that he will exercise them, so this move shouldn't affect the market.

It would be more of a symbolic gesture that DFV still believes in the long term potential of the company, like when he doubled down after the congressional hearing.

If DFV chooses not to exercise, he can sell the contracts for a profit."
2021-04-11 18:42:31,wallstreetbets,He is asking whether he should exercise his ITM 4/16 call option contracts.
2021-04-11 19:46:37,wallstreetbets,Since 2019
2021-04-11 19:58:52,wallstreetbets,"My wife has been exercising at 69. With her new bf. 😭

2021-04-11 19:10:56,wallstreetbets,"I believe that means that he will ""excersise"" his call contracts. Meaning he will use the right that they give him, which is to buy hundreds of shares for a certain price."
2021-04-11 18:59:17,wallstreetbets,Sell the contracts and make money
2021-04-11 19:44:11,wallstreetbets,"As others have pointed out, there is a possibility that his broker has already covered in anticipation of him exercising so it might not move. In that circumstance it would be better for him to sell his contracts. 

That's assuming he only cares about profit, though. He's already made loads, and him doubling down after testifying in front of Congress shows he still believes in the stock. So even if his broker has already covered, he might just exercise them anyway"
2021-04-11 18:32:38,wallstreetbets,"unlikely 50k shares cause any squeeze. It's like a fart in the grand canyon. I am hopeful for the squoze, but it will take way more than that."
2021-04-11 18:58:54,wallstreetbets,The only way to make any money is to sell

2021-04-11 19:32:56,wallstreetbets,"It’ll drive it up. Those who sold the calls will have to buy the shares at market value, and then sell them off-market to him. This will drive up the value, reduce the float, and expedite the squeeze."

2021-04-11 19:26:50,wallstreetbets,"Do you know what exercising would be? If he exercises, he is able to buy 50k shares @ $12, but if he sells the contracts to buy more shares he owns less shares that cost more per share."
2021-04-11 19:42:17,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean? It literally was 50k for all the shares and calls he bought a year ago or so. You can check his profile and see that yourself. As I'm aware he used to work in finances, so to save this amount is not as difficult as it seems. At least for an American with a decent career. He later used gains to buy more."
2021-04-11 19:48:43,wallstreetbets,you don't need to make a lot of money to save a lot of money over time.
2021-04-11 18:59:39,wallstreetbets,To be fair he could literally post a pile of shit and there would be 700 pages of DD on it the next morning

2021-04-11 19:22:16,wallstreetbets,he bought under 40 as I remember. 37.5 or something like that after the Congress Hearing xD legend
2021-04-11 18:58:23,wallstreetbets,One Punch!!!!!
2021-04-11 19:18:18,wallstreetbets,No heat!!
2021-04-11 18:26:03,wallstreetbets,But my tits.....they are already so jacked.
2021-04-11 19:08:17,wallstreetbets,Oh snap. I want to see his bench! BENCH THOSE TENDIES DFV!
2021-04-11 19:26:04,wallstreetbets,No different than the money makers robinhood uses
2021-04-11 18:43:14,wallstreetbets,Also a very good and plausible theory. Thanks!
2021-04-11 18:38:42,wallstreetbets,Not if it's deep ITM he'll get beat up on the spread.
2021-04-11 18:42:21,wallstreetbets,Please explain.
2021-04-11 18:33:42,wallstreetbets,"Alas, I stand corrected."
2021-04-11 19:57:02,wallstreetbets,"I'd pop a cap on that GME short, and I'd slap Melvin doooooown!"
2021-04-11 18:30:58,wallstreetbets,Holy Moly
2021-04-11 18:55:38,wallstreetbets,ME
2021-04-11 18:53:57,wallstreetbets,So DFV will likely make a ton from this but it probably won't mean much for everyone else right now? Thanks for explaining it
2021-04-11 19:42:02,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-04-11 19:48:07,wallstreetbets,"i could definitely see things going this way but i dont think theres 50,000 legit shares out there either.. win win"
2021-04-11 18:48:36,wallstreetbets,How many shares would he buy if he exercises them all?
2021-04-11 19:10:16,wallstreetbets,"Why not 69,420%..."
2021-04-11 18:40:44,wallstreetbets,"The MMs have already hedged against this option a long time ago , won’t make a difference in the share price next week ."
2021-04-11 18:34:39,wallstreetbets,"Yea but does his exercising cause more buying which in turn causes more buying...etc etc etc 

I do like the fart in grand canyon analogy though....also could you imagine the echo??"
2021-04-11 18:36:46,wallstreetbets,"You're absolutely right that exercising the calls won't have much direct impact on the share price, but the last time DFV bought more shares the price started skyrocketing again the following week."
2021-04-11 18:40:10,wallstreetbets,It’s .07% of the float. That actually is quite a bit.
2021-04-11 18:36:01,wallstreetbets,"Yea no doubt, he's definitely is playing a squeeze (to become a billionaire imo) and exercising these just makes it a more attainable goal. With these and assuming no tax he'd need to hit 6k, so with taxes about 12kish"
2021-04-11 19:12:06,wallstreetbets,But I've been told it's only a loss if you sell? So.. Hold?
2021-04-11 18:51:27,wallstreetbets,This is a good option.
2021-04-11 19:03:24,wallstreetbets,You gotta use crayons
2021-04-11 19:34:36,wallstreetbets,lmao no
2021-04-11 19:16:32,wallstreetbets,"We're used to the cup and handle pattern but the squeeze will be in a pile of shit pattern, just like DFV told us!"
2021-04-11 19:34:05,wallstreetbets,"Has he posted a pile of shit? If so, should we all post piles of shit? What shit did he use cat, monkey or people? This is going to mean something big 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎💎🦍🦍🦍🦍💩💩💩💩"
2021-04-11 19:22:24,wallstreetbets,Lol. I'm just jealous

2021-04-11 19:03:03,wallstreetbets,Can confirm. He told me months ago he fucked my wife April 9th 2021.
2021-04-11 19:44:50,wallstreetbets,His hair is also magic. One strand brushed across the skin of your wife and she will have the orgasm of ten thousand boyfriends.

2021-04-11 19:01:32,wallstreetbets,One Standard Hold 💎🙌
2021-04-11 18:34:52,wallstreetbets,Put on some lube so they don’t chafe.
2021-04-11 19:23:27,wallstreetbets,You're excited?! Look at these nipples!
2021-04-11 18:38:36,wallstreetbets,I'll bring the milk
2021-04-11 19:08:59,wallstreetbets,He’s JACKED TO THE TITS!!!
2021-04-11 19:48:49,wallstreetbets,"Correct. There’s a lot more delta liquidity in the underlying (stock) market than the option market. Plus if he intends to hold this position long term, he needs to exercise to be able to take long term capital gains when he eventually exits the position"
2021-04-11 19:12:11,wallstreetbets,No he won’t this is retarded logic
2021-04-11 18:51:05,wallstreetbets,"If he's deep ITM on a week where all the indicators are pointing down, he'd be better off selling the options then buying back in at the lower price point."
2021-04-11 19:03:35,wallstreetbets,"As long as there’s time left until expiration, the option has additional extrinsic value on top of the intrinsic value of it being ITM. All other factors aside, this extrinsic value decays (theta) every day until expiration. Unless he’s worried he won’t be able to acquire the shares in a reasonable amount of time after selling the contract, or there’s a chance the price jumps in that window, it makes more sense to sell the contract, pocket the profit from extrinsic value, and buy the shares.

Edit: Looks like the current Bid/Ask for the 4/16 $12c is 145.10/147.20. Since the intrinsic value (current stock price minus strike price, $158.36 - $12) is $146.36, it might not be worth the headache of trying to offload 500 contracts for pennies of extrinsic value. Since open interest is only 549, selling them would likely drive the price to below the intrinsic value, where it would be more profitable to exercise and sell the shares right away."
2021-04-11 18:55:55,wallstreetbets,He sells the options and wait to buy later.
2021-04-11 18:32:04,wallstreetbets,Holy moly holy moly
2021-04-11 19:01:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes, while sentiment may be impacted either way, this move is unlikely to move the market technically UNLESS the broker is naked on these calls. Very unlikely, though."
2021-04-11 19:42:45,wallstreetbets,Welcome!
2021-04-11 18:54:03,wallstreetbets,50k
2021-04-11 18:53:36,wallstreetbets,"He’d get another 50k shares. For like $12 each IIRC.

Then again, he could sell the contracts for a few mil instead of exercising, so there is that."
2021-04-11 18:59:06,wallstreetbets,50k
2021-04-11 18:36:12,wallstreetbets,Well I personally hope the echo is so freaking loud it causes a massive buy and we all become trillionaires.
2021-04-11 19:04:31,wallstreetbets,I do! How did you know?
2021-04-11 19:35:07,wallstreetbets,"I mean, what you do when you shit? You *squeeze* it out! Tits = jacked."
2021-04-11 19:51:01,wallstreetbets,What if it was in the cup and he had a couple of women showing it off?
2021-04-11 19:18:25,wallstreetbets,God bless her
2021-04-11 19:46:11,wallstreetbets,He’s most likely going to double down on her.  I assume you support that move??

2021-04-11 19:25:18,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure he’s beyond the tits at this point
2021-04-11 19:50:38,wallstreetbets,"Or he could hire ten thousand, thousand dollar hookers and write it off as an expense."
2021-04-11 18:54:19,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-11 19:18:40,wallstreetbets,What's the tax implications as well. Depending on tax law the difference between strike and market is sometimes income if he exercises but if he sells is it capital gains?
2021-04-11 19:19:39,wallstreetbets,Thank you so much I've been passively curious about this for some time now
2021-04-11 19:56:27,wallstreetbets,Wait what would 1 12$ call be worth ? Cause 100 shares at 150 is 15000$ but if he can buy them same 100 shares for 1200 that means the $12 calls must be worth a pretty penny someone please color by number this for me I take a short bus to school
2021-04-11 18:58:43,wallstreetbets,Well that would be the most bearish thing he could do. GME apes won’t like that. Lol
2021-04-11 18:42:18,wallstreetbets,Moly holy
2021-04-11 19:23:52,wallstreetbets,"Could you imagine though, if his broker hadn't covered these and is hedging that he sells the options and then they have to go purchase at market price. Following Monday we see some random broker took a hit."
2021-04-11 19:20:55,wallstreetbets,"If he exercises all 50k, pays $625k for them, then sells at $160 each, $7.4mil

If he exercises and sells at $200, that's $9.4mil"
2021-04-11 19:17:57,wallstreetbets,And if he had planned on selling them he had 2 opportunities to do so for a higher price already (Jan and Feb/Mar runups) amd he still didn't. He's in it for the squeeze
2021-04-11 18:43:11,wallstreetbets,I'd settle for debt free to be honest but millionaire and above is certainly hoped for

But something tells me the forced-buys-from-naked-call-option game was given up by our long whales this week. Last Friday was the first one in a while where we didn't see an EOD push to the next nearest strike price (in this case, $160). 

So, either hitting $155 was the target, or the game will be won by different means."
2021-04-11 19:40:46,wallstreetbets,I choose to hold.

2021-04-11 18:20:04,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-11 18:45:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah for sure that works but wanted to know about a decent website.
2021-04-11 17:40:31,wallstreetbets,Yes is there a calendar or they announce it months prior?
2021-04-11 18:53:16,wallstreetbets,You’ll get tons of sites to choose from. Find and use the one you consider decent.
2021-04-11 17:50:45,wallstreetbets,Typically companies announce earnings dates and times a few weeks in advance. Before they are announce they are estimated because they usually fall around the same time every year. Just look up the company your looking for on Earnings Whisper

2021-04-11 18:28:01,wallstreetbets,"There’s a very good likelihood that the CPI readings and other economic data being released this week will overshadow the earnings reports. The key thing to watch this week will be the 10-year and the bond bandits trying to tell the Fed a story. We know consumer prices will beat the estimate but the question is by how much. If it’s a lot, expect a very muted week for the SPY since it is in need of a breather from last week’s climb. In that case, playing the banks may end up being a good call if we see good earnings and a noticeable spike in the 10-year.

I think energy, industrials, banks, and retail will have a better week than technology."

So many of them unironically believe the stock will be worth thousands or millions of dollars one day. They've poured an unfathomable amount of money into it, with the belief that they're ""sticking it to the hedgies"" - as though the ""hedgies"" aren't making an absolute killing off of GME puts. 

Reading the GME threads and seeing so many people like ""I've got 500 shares at $270, my fellow apes are still coming for me right??"" Like naw dude, at this point you're bagholding for people who would never do the same for you.

To any GME people who can still be reached: if you actually value the money you've put in, get out now. ""$5 million is not a meme"" is a meme, but ""living in a cardboard box"" is not."

2021-04-11 18:16:12,wallstreetbets,"thinking about putting a grand into $ASO or $AFRM

i like academy for a very specific reason: firearms and ammunition. as more and more sporting goods stores have halted the sale of anything related to guns, academy has been filling that hole for consumers. since the all around shit show of 2020, they can’t keep firearms/ammo in stock because it immediately sells out. that demand is going to continue for the foreseeable future, especially as fears of potential bans continue to swell. i don’t have any hard data to back this up. i’m purely speculating based on my own observations. 

i like $AFRM because it’s finally reasonably priced and could potentially disrupt (i hate using that term but whatever) the traditional credit card business model. they’re not profitable yet, but even the lowest price target from analysts is 10% above the current price.

whatchall think?"

Strikingly similar speech to what was commonly admitted by contemporary commentators, in 1937.

The first goal of appeasement is not to appease other countries, but to appease your own populace, especially in a democracy where comfy people don't want to hear bad news from guys they elect. (look further down this thread, at the denialism)

The good things about not being a democracy is that not only you can rile up your people at will, but on top of that, you can actually get them ready for war. I can guarantee you firsthand that China is preparing for war, i.e. hot-war.

Nobody will nuke anybody, or need to.

2021-04-11 16:01:10,wallstreetbets,Positions or ban? If you’re confident in your research you should short the stock.
2021-04-11 17:20:57,wallstreetbets,"Looks like an undergraduate paper. If i was a professor at the college i went to (which had real grading curve) i would give the paper a C+.

It grades that high only because of the amount of work and effort that went into it.  But it lacks 2 big things:

1)Seeking out contratry opinions and applying them critically

2) orginal thinking and analysis

without those  2 it could only have value if it contained orignal research.  It has none.

Original research is the last thing any investor wants to do in my mind.  original research is collecting your own info that you KNOW very few others have found and haven't lined up toward.  in other words its meaningful and mysterious.

Unfortunately, opportunites to have better info than others is small, and there is a huge risk of over relying on it and ignoring sometimes obvious info to the contrary.

Ive always believed its best to be a better thinker.  Spot where the puck is going, what will investrs move to next.  see the thinking of others and how it has to change, you will always find a good trade to capitalize on this.

&#x200B;

Now let me keep tearing this paper appart by pointing out where your analysis lack critical analysis:

""Tesla’s core business model across both segments relies heavily on state and federal government subsidies in order to operate (“Tesla 10-Q”, 2020).""

comes from the risks and uncertaintcies section of their disclosure filings.  Risk and uncertaincies are not conclusive facts.  They are 'fact sounding' statements phrased to illustrate  how risks and uncertainties about the status quo can become negative developments.  It is a RISK that support ending from these programs challenges their profitability, not a certainty.  By comparison Cigarette companies has had the statement that the health impact, lawsuits, and regulations or bans of cigarettes could result in loss of sales unpredictable payouts for 30 years now.  If you owned them and reinvested the divvies you've beaten the market hands down over that time.

&#x200B;

""Tesla’s strength is really down to the cult of personality surrounding Elon Musk. For better or for worse, without Elon Musk’s personal brand, Tesla would have gone bankrupt long ago because it is not a sustainable business model. Tesla has survived through a combination of a secular bull market, dovish monetary policy, generous fiscal policy, corporate welfare, and legions of wishful thinking investors ""

Do you seriously believe this is analysis?  you never proved it wasn't 'sustainable' (see above).  So their cars suck?  They don't sell well?  They haven't invented and commercialized breakthrough tech?  They haven't rethought the who car business?  The customer growth is all bullshit?  All these people are just in a cult?  Might be a good idea to study how he could do all this, i'd like to bottle it and drink so i to can make billions and build a company with 70K people that the government just hands over money to me to profit.

&#x200B;

""These automakers can undoubtedly make a better electric vehicle (EV) than Tesla at a more attractive price point for consumers. ""

Tesla has been selling evs for 15 years now.  Where are these better cheaper competing cars?  Don't all car companies have a similar chance to dine on all this corporate ev welfare?  Why is tesla so much better at it?  Because what?  Elon cult?"
2021-04-11 15:59:17,wallstreetbets,"So... Tesla outperforms every expectation people place on it, literally changes the automotive industry forever, and you compare it to a fraud scheme? That alone reveals the depth of your bias, which in turn compromises your credibility.

2021-04-11 17:53:08,wallstreetbets,"Do you even understand the Enron scandal? I thought it a click-bait and I was right. 

Enron was engaging in systemic and planned accounting fraud. This is why the S-O act was passed, which helped protect shareholders by making financial reports accurate and transparent. **You give NO evidence of Tesla committing off-the-books accounting practices and incorporating fake holdings**. Do you realize the degree to which TSLA's financials gets dissected and analyzed, short-sellers would be joyed to find any level of inconsistency. Size is the key factor, the larger the firm, the more analysts tend to follow it and thus the faster new information is likely to be reflected in the stock’s price.

Your biggest premise is that there must be wrong and fishy with Tesla because you don't understand its evaluation. Tesla's evaluation is largely based on its future potential (i.g. ride-sharing, shelf driving, data congregation, automation, semi, etc.), its 5-10 years out the net income. Besides them being them having the first-mover advantage, they own a ton of patented technology, including battery, brand name, and vertically integrated operations. The largest part of Tesla's evaluation is the growing consumer acceptance of electric vehicles. People are more environmentally conscious and want energy sources that are clean and sustainable. 

You did a great analysis and put in the time to cite your sources. However, the sources you cite are largely biased and mostly based on personal opinion with no backing. I recommend peer-reviewed academic articles and Harvard Business Review. I'm sure you will get better doing analysis as you progress beyond the first couple of classes in business school."
2021-04-11 16:10:16,wallstreetbets,"Lmao I’ve been following Tesla for literally a decade, and they’ve never been more financially secure.

A lot of times in this sub you can’t tell if a DD is just FUD disguised as DD, but holy shit... as someone who has *religiously* followed Tesla for over a decade, it is **blatantly** obvious this is FUD, wow!

While the only thing I agree on is that they’re over priced, but your “reasons” are 100% FUD. They’re over priced if your goal is short term investment. However they definitely can be worth what they are today 5-6 years from now. Since stock is always ahead of actual value, 5-6 years from now the stock could be even higher.

Your “reasons” are almost perfect copy-pasta of all the FUD on Tesla over the last 10 years combined into a single Reddit post."

You’re probably right and there will be a 1-2 year period where you wouldn’t want to own Tesla.

I think this is flawed logic.  The alternate way is to stay in the game until the majority of autos produced is electric.  Then Teslas market advantage will make them more profitable as traditional manufacturers won't be able to compete on price.  With rumored incentives  this is where we are heading."

Is this a sensible valuation? Fuck no, regardless of musks 'charisma', memes and stated goals assuming Tesla will do all of that is insane. But the market is insane and honestly if I had to bet on one company actually pulling this shit off it would 100% be Tesla. I think minimally Tesla has positioned itself to have a shot at dominating the US and Chinese automated taxi markets that both governments (and all governments) desperately want to implement. This is massively disruptive to the existing order of things and to society as a whole so hedges are very, very excited about it. Don't kid yourself that retail drove any of this stock growth, total bullshit, it was always big money because they see a future where Tesla is a fucking megacorp as powerful as a moderately sized European country (eg Austria).

Edit - the issue a lot of bears have with Tesla is that they see them as another car manufacturer and thats simply not the case. Theyve already made the technology needed to run an  automated car network, they just need the laws to change to implement it. And we know those laws will change because it will decrease inefficiency of travel immeasurably. It will also have very serious knock on effects on the labour market but that's an entirely different discussion."

With the uprise in EV, solar, wind, and continual demand for better batteries in laptops, phones, etc. Whoever owns the best batteries owns the future.

Additionally, Tesla isn't just a cult stock, it's a cult brand, like Apple. Even if other companies like Ford or GM come out with better products, they can't compete on the brand name."

2021-04-11 17:22:50,wallstreetbets,"So... I’m not in total disagreement, but it’s not Enron - maybe Packard is a better example. They’re overvalued by a lot, but they do own the hype and the chutzpah that more traditional companies look to really work toward and that is a large part of it. They’re also setting the standard for the market, and in order to move them from market share, you’re going to have to do it cheaper, better and longer than they did to even begin to make a dent in the enthusiasm. Even if GMs product is fully up to speed and successful, you still have years to offload a long hold on Tesla. Tesla isn’t Enron. Enron was a scam.

One can argue the price is high, that other EV makers are catching up (they’re not lol), etc etc, but this DD doesn’t look too much into the company and what it stands for, aka only surface level stuff. 

Tesla has completely reinvented the car industry, with the combination of engineering talent, foresight, and sheer fucking will/brilliance of Elon. At the expense of some quality, expansion has been utterly crazy and almost unfathomable, i.e. factories in Texas, Berlin, China (great move to capture demand early before other EV makers), etc. Unlike Enron, there’s a HUGEEEE demand for Tesla. Tesla has been expanding and aggressively planning ahead even during times many doubted them. I use to work there, it’s legit. Thousand highly interested customers would come over the weekend for test drives and many would purchase. This is back in 2018-2019. Not to mention, I saw multiple areas in Tesla. The people working at engineering are young and have a point to prove, anyone can talk to Elon/mgmt if they see something to improve. Tesla’s ability to always be on their feet 24/7 and rapidly shift their direction has been one of their premier advantages. By the time other companies have decided to follow suit, Elon/Tesla is already 5 years ahead (supercharging network, batteries, software integration, etc). Don’t get me started on their continual battery improvements, their FSD (yes many broken promises on timeline), and general technology, software + hardware advantages. No one is even close. Tesla is the 1st in a lifetime company in terms of sheer innovation. The price reflects that. You see highly inflated numbers, regular financial people see fraud or whatever, but people see and believe Tesla."

OP's wall of text of short thesis can be summed up with this paragraph:

> **Tesla is also facing increasing competition from well established automakers like Ford Motors and General Motors. These automakers can undoubtedly make a better electric vehicle (EV) than Tesla at a more attractive price point for consumers.** As such, they will continue to take market share away from Tesla, and may eventually take over the company (MacDuffie, 2018).

To which my TL;DR response: bwhahahahahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


A slightly longer response:

- Tesla EV market share in the US in 2018: **53%**
- Tesla EV market share in the US in 2019: **80%**
- Tesla EV market share in the US in 2020: **79%**
- Tesla EV market share in the US in 2021'Q1: **85%**

Exactly which market share figure here is telling you that Ford and GM is giving Tesla ""increased"" competition, ""taking away"" market share from Tesla? 🤔

&nbsp;

But let's see other major legacy auto competitors:

&nbsp;

**1)** Volkswagen

The question is... will TSLA FSD be the software that makes it all work? or will some other competitor be the one.  TSLA seems like the smart bet cause they've been doing it longer, they have seemingly unlimited money, and Musk is an engineer CEO.

But hey, maybe Apple/Google/Microsoft dive in and catch up, maybe the government decides TSLA doesn't get to own automated transportation and breaks TSLA up or maybe China steals and leaks it.  Who the fuck knows, this is still a casino.

2021-04-11 16:59:52,wallstreetbets,"I'm 100% with you in that Tesla can't justify it's current market cap, but I wouldn't bet against it because the markets are not rational. Your SWOT analysis should also be made on the stock price. That will give you a different outcome. 

Tesla's demise may come if a large automaker nails the EV market before Tesla starts shipping millions of cars. The problem is that the automakers are like oil companies, it's in their best interest not to kill the combustion engine, and they have too many dinosaurs that can't innovate and don't get modern user experience. Add to that carbon credits, the battery business, and the effects of hype and you have a TSLA price that it is what it is now."
2021-04-11 19:40:40,wallstreetbets,"What competition? The global auto market is between 70-80 million units per year. Tesla has a goal of 20 million vehicles made per year by 2030 so there’s plenty of room for competition. In order for the world to move to EVs, Tesla HAS to lose market share. All that matters is that Tesla continues to sell more cars every year and they’ve been doing that. 

In fact, the more EV competition the better it is for Tesla because it legitimizes the entire market and that’s really what needs to happen right now. 

It seems like you did a lot of excel spreadsheet research for this, but not a lot of industry research and that’s why so much of this DD is totally off."

Even if Tesla engages in ""earnings management"", they have an auditor who signs off their accounts, there is the SEC (letter E in the middle stands for Elon's btw) who are constantly up TSLA's ass, there are dozens of hedge funds who lost billions shorting TSLA and they still cannot prove fraudulent accounting...creative accounting maybe,  but not illegal.

Couldn't resist, take \#3.

&nbsp;

OP tries to brush aside Tesla's high-profile self-driving (FSD) project that would unlock:

- the 5 trillion dollars (per year) autonomous taxi market,
- and the 9 trillion dollars (per year) global logistics market,

... granting Tesla a first-mover advantage & quasi-monopoly.

So before anyone is shorting Tesla, I am challenging them to watch these FSD videos and come away unimpressed:

- https://youtu.be/rKG3eDppzm4 : **""Navigating around Pittsburg, CA in FSD BETA 8.2""**
- https://youtu.be/GfqM59wi2Mo : **""Raw 1x Tesla Autopilot FSD Manhattan Beach to Del Amo Mall""**
- https://youtu.be/TOQ3gdx6Evs : **""[FSD Beta 8.2] handles mountains like a champ""**
- https://youtu.be/5uqpA3beAhc : **""Unprotected (blind) left turns in Tesla FSD BETA 8.1""**

It's not perfect, but improving rapidly - the super-linear scaling commonly seen with complex neural networks.

Tesla, with their huge fleet, are far better & faster at mapping out the thousands, tens of thousands of special cases that reliable driving requires than any traditional software driven self-driving project is able to - and it's far less expensive as well."
2021-04-11 19:33:30,wallstreetbets,"GM could make a better EV and nobody would buy it because their current EV is ugly as shit. Also, their major issue is the dealer network and service revenue.

Just like the cost of spacex reusable rockets - which don’t show any savings at all.

Building tiny tunnels you have to drive your own car through for the same price everyone else charges isn’t just dumb it’s regressive, it kills an opportunity to install actual subways.

The mysticism around the fed has brought out a lot of droolers that like to point to that as justification for why the market it up so much. It’s more likely the record amount of margin debt  and actions of funds like Archegos can explain the stupid valuations right now."

2021-04-11 19:27:59,wallstreetbets,"The theory is that it's a software license.  TSLA lets you use their software and you get to turn your hunk of metal into a small business that makes money... but of course they are going to take a bite out of your profits.

The conviction that its gonna be TSLA with the lion share of the profits is that:

They are ~5 years ahead.  
They have an absolute fuck ton of money, so even if some brilliant start-up figures out something magic they can just fucking buy them out.
Software scales, so there isn't much room for 2nd place.  So it makes sense for the rest of the world to just use FSD and compete elsewhere.

When robotaxis take over, they will eat the entirety of cab/rideshare driver income.  That income will be redistributed to: 

TSLA (or the software company), Uber/Lyft (or whoever owns the car), and/or the Rider (in cheaper fares).

2021-04-11 18:04:34,wallstreetbets,"She like, ""Apples to oranges""
Bitch that phrase don't make no sense
Why can't fruit be compared?"
2021-04-11 16:35:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you'd buy the other fully electric car for 70k!"
2021-04-11 19:29:50,wallstreetbets,If you say so.
2021-04-11 16:37:32,wallstreetbets,"Not yet, but I'm sure it will happen. You can imagine my cringe though."
2021-04-11 16:23:30,wallstreetbets,Smarter and richer people than you have tried to short tesla. Buy some leap puts and let me know how it works out.
2021-04-11 19:25:38,wallstreetbets,"Oh sorry, my 700% gains soon to be 2000% gains are so fucking embarrassing."
2021-04-11 17:08:19,wallstreetbets,"Gm projections on the ev sector are set for 2035...
Yeah there will be blood in a decade."
2021-04-11 17:18:13,wallstreetbets,Tesla's recall ratio is 3 times lower than legacy automakers.
2021-04-11 16:45:23,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention that the rare metals for the batteries are all mined in China. They're a hair away from invading Taiwan as it is, and if/when they do, the world's ""renewable energy"" sector is going to get wrecked."
2021-04-11 19:09:55,wallstreetbets,Nice I think earnings gonna be big drop
2021-04-11 18:09:37,wallstreetbets,Your prediction that it will become a penny stock is such a delusion of grandeur.
2021-04-11 18:13:03,wallstreetbets,Indeed. That's how the markets work. People investing based on their own decision and sentiment. But the fact that we're all looking at companies like TSLA and just think about the EV market is stupid when there might not even be that many gasoline cars on the road in a decade or so. There is still a shit ton of unrealized market potential.
2021-04-11 16:48:18,wallstreetbets,I am taking 2 short positions this week.  PLTR and TSLA.
2021-04-11 18:39:07,wallstreetbets,"Here's a simple reason: because only an idiot would believe the largest automakers in the world for 100 years would simply just fold and go away if the world goes towards EV. 

Does everybody buy ford cars because they innovated the mass production vehicle? Same reason everyone won't buy Teslas once the competitors come in."
2021-04-11 16:44:34,wallstreetbets,"25% GM

What discount rate are you using? I used 11% as the average S&P CAGR."
2021-04-11 18:43:51,wallstreetbets,"Without going beyond your very first comment it’s clear you’ve drunk the kool-aid. If you break down Boring Company bluster, they compare their cost to dig tunnels to the cost of an entire subway system including stations. If you compare the cost to dig just holes it’s exactly the same as everyone else’s not least because they use the same drilling machines everyone else uses.

You know why the convention center loop is cheap? It doesn’t have stations. Want a station? Same price.

They promised 150mph multi user vehicles and delivered a dumbass tunnel that required you bring your own car and a max speed of 35mph. Utterly worthless 😂

You know what else has zero emissions and goes into a tunnel? An average fucking subway train 😂

I’m with you on the next 4 infrastructural points and I think they’ve got some room to grow into that space but that’s nowhere even a little bit close to justifying their valuation when compared to peer companies in that space.

Self-driving? They’re behind waymo and even if they somehow get there first - and they might - it’ll only be a temporary advantage as their peers or someone like Bosch just sell it to everyone else.

$150/share is a pretty generous price target."
2021-04-11 18:06:30,wallstreetbets,"kek you're high, stupid, delusional, or a mix of all three"
2021-04-11 18:33:09,wallstreetbets,"Did you even read my OP, or did you just jump into the comments like a true retard? I used 50% rev growth through 2026 AND 10% rev growth after that. This is higher than the street estimated AND IT STILL WAS NOT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE CURRENT PRICE.

So please, by all means put your life savings into a seedy company that either needs 1) more smoke and mirrors to wow retards or 2) greater than 50% revenue growth through 2026 without missing a beat.

Good luck, dipshit."
2021-04-11 17:57:52,wallstreetbets,Bro the guy got an A on his hw. You think he cares about some internet guys argument?
2021-04-11 17:16:19,wallstreetbets,What if the (near) future simply isn't boring and stable? We're entering a time of unprecedented change.
2021-04-11 19:50:11,wallstreetbets,"SPY will be MINUS 50% this year, while tesla maintains its current value"
2021-04-11 19:38:54,wallstreetbets,"I just gave you a back of the envelop projection based on what they are actually making money on now. Selling batteries is not that profitable, less then selling cars as it's lower down in the production chain. Public transit is not a major room for profit growth in the future; profit margins will be razor thin and money will be made on fleet management on the margins. Solar panels? Like batteries, it's a commodity very low down on the production chain

How about you give me some projections? I already gave you a perfectly reasonable number, 30% a year growth"
2021-04-11 19:54:32,wallstreetbets,"Tesla energy is a dud, dude. They produced more kwh in 2015 than they do in 2021."
2021-04-11 18:05:05,wallstreetbets,"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
2021-04-11 16:36:37,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely. I'd get a whole lot more car for $70k! All killer no filler, unlike a Tesla!"
2021-04-11 19:39:02,wallstreetbets,"lol you don't have 700% gains, keep dreaming kiddo"
2021-04-11 18:47:46,wallstreetbets,That’s because Tesla doesn’t want to issue recalls unless forced to. They can barely keep up with current service requests as it is.
2021-04-11 18:46:54,wallstreetbets,I said that only IF my suspicions about accounting fraud end up correct. Learn to read.
2021-04-11 18:24:42,wallstreetbets,"Indeed, fair points. I do not think we will be giving up gas powered cars or oil anytime soon (within 30 years) simply because we have an ocean of oil here in the CONUS and we are energy independent. But as you said, that's how the market works and only time will tell. I'm not really bullish on any automakers but if I had to pick one I wouldn't be choosing TSLA."
2021-04-11 18:45:06,wallstreetbets,"Rest in pepperonis, clown"
2021-04-11 18:43:55,wallstreetbets,"That’s literally still just your opinion, retard. 

bEcAuSe I sAiD sO!!!!"
2021-04-11 19:43:02,wallstreetbets,"But that’s exactly what they are doing, folding, delaying, not building EV factories and asking for bailouts."
2021-04-11 17:10:54,wallstreetbets,"Ah so I have that they’ll get 7.6B (based on 1.9B FCF q4 2020) FCF in 2021, and then grow 60% the next two years, then 50% the next 3 years, leading to 32B FCF in 2026, which is a $650B market cap at 20x multiple. I didn’t take into account any dilution, but I also didn’t take into account further growth. Did 12% discount rate

I’m guessing we started at a different initial FCF"
2021-04-11 17:14:13,wallstreetbets,"The reason why I and others have such have revenue growth expectations is the speed at which they are building their factories, and the slow speed at which other EV makers will be able to acquire or build batteries"
2021-04-11 18:07:30,wallstreetbets,You're blind and don't understand what Tesla is.
2021-04-11 18:35:14,wallstreetbets,"95% of my retirement funds are in TSLA. No ragrets, retard. 

I can’t wait to come back to this post in a year and find out you deleted it."
2021-04-11 19:31:59,wallstreetbets,"That was the funniest part. Talking shit about ARK but thinks because they got an A on a school paper they know better. Then they say that Ford and GM will overtake Tesla. There’s book smarts and real world smarts, lots of statements in the post that clearly show they don’t understand the EV market and haven’t done any research on what’s actually happening, just looking at previous numbers for their homework assignment. Sucks to be paying for a class that considers this “A” level research."
2021-04-11 17:18:53,wallstreetbets,"What if $SPY is not boring and stable? Then everyone is going to have some stuff to worry about. I'm generally content with the idea that $SPY crashing is equivalent to ""End Of The World"" and we're all kinda screwed.

That said, because of WSB I now know about options. As my kids get closer to college age I'll be throwing away a bit of money on SPY puts to protect me from any sudden downturns when I need the cash."
2021-04-11 19:55:05,wallstreetbets,"Dude, they’re growing at 100% this year and you shit a 30% number out of your ass like it’s the truth."
2021-04-11 19:54:06,wallstreetbets,I had 1000% gains at ATH. My average is $86.
2021-04-11 18:47:44,wallstreetbets,In that case its delusion alone

2021-04-11 19:06:09,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately for you, even if you were correct in calling tesla overvalued (which is a pretty big 'if'; I have yet to see any strong bear cases against it that have solid evidence besides ""buh buh buh mah Ford!""), the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Enjoy your second blown up portfolio."
2021-04-11 17:25:07,wallstreetbets,"I used FCF instead of earnings, because that’s what bezos and buffie like 

Plus Tesla (at least as of last quarter) had a negative cash conversion cycle, which I would expect to decrease even more as they localize production with new factories"

2021-04-11 15:02:45,wallstreetbets,I think people are vastly overestimating the 4/20 thing. Please be careful!
2021-04-11 15:04:14,wallstreetbets,4/20 Is Coming Fatherfuckers
2021-04-11 15:32:50,wallstreetbets,I have Tlry options also. You need the stock price to go up over $22.00 to break even. That is over a 10% move in 2 weeks. I would give yourself more time or buy 5 of the $19.00 calls. I think you have a better chance of making money  at 19. You would then only need a move to 21. As soon as this week is over with those options end up being the front week stock stays flat this week and thru the weekend you will see major decay. You could also buy the 5/21. Trying to hit a home run with short dated out of the money call options usually doesn't end well. Just my opinion.  Good luck with whatever you decide.
2021-04-11 14:49:43,wallstreetbets,Not DD change the flair this is discussion.
2021-04-11 15:12:35,wallstreetbets,"I’ve never played options so probably not the best person to take advice from but I have seen smarter people play them. They say a good rule is to give yourself twice as much time as you think, I know it’s 4/20, but it’s also your rent money. 

Hope it works out for you. ✌️"
2021-04-11 15:52:13,wallstreetbets,I see lots of call flow for 21c weeklies.  I’ll be watching

2021-04-11 17:32:41,wallstreetbets,Start with civil engineering companies like AECOM and Jacob's. Flour does engineering and construction. Engineering comes before construction for the majority of projects. PAVE is an ETF that has I think 100 infrastructure companies in their portfolio. Materials companies will also make out well like Martin Marrietta once construction starts.

2021-04-11 13:09:57,wallstreetbets,"I bought the $170 put and sold the $150 put when the COHEN news showed a fail breakout of $180 .. it hit $185,,, quickly reversed and I put in a bid soon as it hit $178 ... However, it has become very crowded very quickly as the open interest in puts ballooned late Thursday and all day Friday... So, I'm no dummy.. I have to bail .. Those late to the game make a big imbalance to the curve forcing those selling the contracts to buy the stock and try to hold $170.. It's a game, not a valuation machine."

2021-04-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC Stock Price: Factors Working Against the Company at the Moment Initially posted on [r/AMC\_meltdown](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMC_meltdown/), cross-posting here to solicit some additional input and counter-points to refine and adjust the list, as needed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The   purpose of this post is to provide an objective, rational review of  the  adverse factors that already have impacted the price of AMC stock,  or  may do so in the future. These factors continue to be largely  ignored by  the mainstream subreddits.

This   is not financial advice or analysis, but rather a restatement of   publicly available data to counter some of the overly optimistic or   straight up misleading “DDs”  that choose to gloss over the reality of   the company’s fundamentals.

&#x200B;

1. **AMC market cap and price per share was in steady decline pre-Covid**

* [Market cap](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/market_cap) has been declining since 2017 (highest point circa 6.3B in 2017 compared to 2.6B in 2018, 1.7B in 2019 and then 4.24B today) even pre-Covid.

&#x200B;

2. **AMC’s shares were significantly diluted in the past 12 months**

* AMC issued 278M new shares in the past 12 months

>[2021 10K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/595ff2b1-1e4c-43d2-a6d3-0ad5e7c6a11e.html):   “During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 91.0 million shares…   In January 2021, we sold approximately 187.0 million shares.”

* Additionally,   more shares were issued to AMC’s debt holders (convertible notes)  which  exercised their rights to convert those notes into shares. This,   however, helped reduce company’s debt and annual interest expense (but   worsened the dilution).

>[2021 10K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/595ff2b1-1e4c-43d2-a6d3-0ad5e7c6a11e.html):   “The January 2021 conversion by holders … of our … Notes … into shares   of our Class A common stock…, which resulted in the issuance of   44,422,860 shares.”

* Even more shares were added to the float through various programs such as stock based compensation program, [*increasing the float*](https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/amc/) *from 52M to now 450M in a span of a little over a year*.

&#x200B;

3. **Request to authorize more shares may lead to significant further dilution**

* AMC requested its shareholders approval to issue up to 500M additional shares ([SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001047469-21-000518/)), which would effectively more than double the float.
* While   no immediate share issuance is proposed, as indicated above AMC did  not  hesitate to rather materially dilute its shares in 2020/Q1 of 2021.

&#x200B;

4. **AMC balance sheet continues to be severely burdened with debt**

* [Total liabilities](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/chart/#/?annotations=&annualizedReturns=false&calcs=id:liabilities,include:true,,&chartType=interactive&correlations=&dateSelection=range&displayDateRange=false&displayTicker=false&endDate=&format=real&legendOnChart=true&maxPoints=&note=&partner=basic_850&quoteLegend=true&quotes=&recessions=false&redesign=false&scaleType=linear&securities=id:AMC,include:true,,&securityGroup=&securitylistName=&securitylistSecurityId=&source=false&splitType=single&startDate=&title=&units=false&useCustomColors=false&useEstimates=false&zoom=5&chartView=&liveData=false) increased from 6.6B in 2017 to 8B in 2019 to now 13.3B in 2021
* Further   increases in debt may cause share prices to drop. AMC is cautiously   optimistic about having sufficient cash to last them through March 2022,   but this is contingent on theaters starting to generate significant   revenue by Q3

>[2021 10K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/595ff2b1-1e4c-43d2-a6d3-0ad5e7c6a11e.html):   “\[F\]uture offerings of debt, which would be senior to our Class A   common stock for purposes of distributions or upon liquidation, could   adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock

2021-04-11 10:43:15,wallstreetbets,"

The company went from 500 million in revenue to 0 overnight due to Covid.

Share dilution was necessary to keep bankruptcy off the table. Short action tried and is still trying to crash the stock

The stock has and always been a massive recovery play. Most Screens in the US compared to every US competitor

Pent up demand coming out of Covid

It’s mobile app and subscription business is soaring, it also is seeing an increase to its streaming business

It’s well positioned to blowout earnings and has seen consistent revenue growth. The stock jumped on the earnings of one blockbuster King Kong 

There is currently a 130 million borrowed shares if you look at the options market 15$ calls are being bought in mass.

Short position is a ticking time bomb imho. I love GME too but AMC investors i truly believe are going to make a killing (not a financial advisor)"

2021-04-11 10:47:42,wallstreetbets,"Reduced attendance because movie theaters are closed due to covid, movie studios continue to postpone new movie releases"
2021-04-11 12:37:09,wallstreetbets,"**5. Shortening theatrical windows create a significant headwind for AMC**

Pretty much all the major movie studios (Disney, Warner, et al) have indicated they'll begin releasing some (or all) of their movies to their streaming platforms on the same day that it hits the box office.  In other words, when a new box office hit comes out, customers will have the option to watch it from the comfort of their own homes instead of going out to a theater.

In the cases where they still exclusively release a movie to box office first, theatrical windows have been negotiated to be shorter.

This creates a significant headwind to revenue returning to 2019 levels.  Theaters have historically been very low margin businesses (NI/Revenue < 10%).  So, headwinds like this can easily turn the theater business from slightly profitable to loss incurring.  This, on top of the fact that AMC will have to service an increasing debt load makes it improbable they will ever return to profitability.

**6. CNK's share price remains 30% lower compared to pre-COVID**

This is perhaps the most blatant proof that AMC doesn't trade on fundamentals.  If you believe AMC's business is fundamentally 2.5X more valuable than it was pre-COVID, you also have to explain why CNK's share price doesn't reflect the same appreciation.  I think we all know markets are not that inefficient.

**Additional commentary**

So, it goes without saying any rational investor who is long AMC, is long purely due to speculation of a  squeeze.  However, even in the case that a squeeze occurs, the impending share authorization will allow shorts to cover at a reasonable price by purchasing shares from AMC.  Effectively, this upcoming share authorization transfers the profit potential of a short squeeze from retail investors to AMC's pockets.

So, that begs the question, you are holding your position until the May vote for what reason? In all likelihood, the vote will pass, which spells the end to any semi-realistic short squeeze thesis."

2021-04-11 15:00:52,wallstreetbets,None of this matters when you bought shares at 1.91 a share. Also the movie cycle in general from 2017 to 2020 was horrible the only notable movies that came out in that time frame were Logan deadpool 2 avengers infinity wars avengers endgame and Star Wars rise of skywalker. It’s not really the movie theaters fault it’s the movie makers for making shit movies. Now that Disney has enough blockbuster content to release a hit every 6 months we should see people returning to theaters in droves. Especially with all the movies that are slated to come out. This movies from home thing is too expensive to be a long term thing.

Edit: it is helpful and important to know the shear scope of the dilution through shares and convertibles. Thank you. 

As a suggestion, consider having a summary bullet that’s adds it all together and states it cleanly (e.g. total shares outstanding has grown from Xx in mm/yy to xxxx in mm/yy) (a $10 share price now is equivalent based on market cap and shares outstanding to a share price of XX 3 months ago)"

Anyway I have some puts on AMC, that were helped funded by 11 to 14 dollar call option credit spreads.  But after the dilution and when the stock gets into the fours, that's the time to buy, and I'll be long.  Good to own a few thousand to sell CC and other fun things.  I predict AMC will be a favorite stock for another year or so because it will be around 3 to 7 dollars a people will remember when it was 14, just like they remember it was supposedly 20 pre-covid days of the stock."
2021-04-11 10:27:06,wallstreetbets,"Apes own the new ""diluted"" float more now than ever before. 90%

Also the avg Ape holds more AMC than GME simply bcuz its ""cheaper""

AMC is being shorted by the exact same shorts as GME. when Citadel gets their margin call for GME itll b a catalyst for AMC also.

Adam Aron is known as a fixer and will pull AMC out of debt with the help of Apes who are going to the theaters on a consistent basis. He also could easily pull the company out of debt after the squeeze.

He has also stated he wouldn't dilute the float and would use the shares over the course of TEN YEARS. I find zero reason not to trust him for he hates short sellers as much as any APE.

While IMHO GME will go higher than AMC... AMC will still do significant damage to Citadel and the other shorts. 

Apes in the SAME war just on DIFFERENT battlefields."

2021-04-11 10:19:47,wallstreetbets,🥱
2021-04-11 15:22:17,wallstreetbets,"this is a strange post. OP says they are long on the stock yet they are bashing it. why would you sabotage your own position? Also logic doesn't matter in this irrational market, so these numbers mean nothing."
2021-04-11 10:56:34,wallstreetbets,Your market cap point is wrong. It’s highest market cap in 2017 was just over $4B. So it’s trading at around it’s all time high pre Covid market cap. You think the prospects for this company are literally the best they’ve ever been??
2021-04-11 10:33:49,wallstreetbets,"Would issuing the 500,000,000 shares make it possible for someone to get a majority stake in the company? Would that have to be stated in the SEC filing?"
2021-04-11 10:22:05,wallstreetbets,Yes ... and now explain me the fact big hedges like blackrock an co increased their stocks massively till end of last year and didn’t sold even the price was much higher than today ...
2021-04-11 12:18:00,wallstreetbets,Put put put
2021-04-11 16:05:56,wallstreetbets,"AMC isn't going through a corporate transformation like GameStop is. AMC got obliterated by COVID since people can't go to movies anymore. There's no special strategy to deal with watching movies from home, or if this covid situation is prolonged for another year. 

Could the stock rebound once theaters open up again? Maybe. But AMC isn't doing the same things to innovate like other theaters are. It's a pure meme stock without the substance GME has behind it."
2021-04-11 17:44:24,wallstreetbets,"I smell FUD. There are no talks about the positivity the CEO has for fellow apes. at one point on the most untrusted site Fintel. It said shrot interest was at 29% and GME was at 17%.

I'm sorry hate no hate other apes. But equally AMC even without squeeze is worth at least 30.

I'd have no issues if this was a balanced post and not one about crashingAMC."

At least be honest of your intentions here 🤡"
2021-04-11 12:01:16,wallstreetbets,"All the same principles apply on hedge funds manipulating the price because they haven't actually covered with real shares. It's also a growing social movement. Like GME people know what AMC is. They can identify with it. They want to go to the movies now that they see light at the end of the tunnel. The only thing standing in the way of this is
Adam Aron getting greeding looking for some kind of magic bullet to solve his debt issue. This is what hedge funds who have a very significant short position are actually hoping for. Hence why mainstream media is touting Aron as some kind of genius and that he should be dumping 500m shares on the float asap. He does that and NO ONE will go to the movies.

Social movements like this don't happen very often but when they do it can be incredibly powerful. No one in the media is even remotely evaluating this and still want to harp on FunDaMenTals."
2021-04-11 12:04:44,wallstreetbets,The highest market cap hit in 2017 was \~4.1 Billion it hit an all time high of \~6.7 Billion in Jan. Today its around today its \~4.2 Billion so just over what it was in its peak in 2017.
2021-04-11 15:13:14,wallstreetbets,"It's the trend that's important, i.e. which way is business trending. I think it hit bottom and has hit an inflection point. I think AA realizes this too and wants to issue the shares to pay off debts asap which makes business sense but is bad for us squeeze-waiters. So the question becomes (and imo same is true for GME) has the stock changed from a short-squeeze play to a value play?

If short squeeze, then we just need a catalyst, like a no vote on share authorization. If a value play, imo it has bottomed because there is a tsunami of people who can't wait to go back to the movie theatre. So IMO the factors working against the company are a past storm we are just coming out of. Also a point of clarification: the vote is to authorize shares being issued, not an issuance itself."
2021-04-11 11:00:35,wallstreetbets,Movie theaters are dead
2021-04-11 10:43:46,wallstreetbets,"AMC is still trading at a discount to peers on 2019 sales, and has improved margins since then. The long term liability is a combination of leases and debt due in 2026, compared to cinemark where most debt is 2022 or 2023. 

The price of AMC is contingent on your view of the whole theater segment. If you feel that the segment is fairly valued, AMC is about 30% undervalued at least."
2021-04-11 12:39:58,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget that the current price is suppressed by short laddering. And that the stock is heavily shorted but the price has been up since the beginning of the year. So short interest is stacking up.

2021-04-11 11:47:19,wallstreetbets,Covid lockdowns and studios postponing releases. AMC went into debt to stay afloat. Gonna have to wait a couple quarters for it to really rebound. A gamma squeeze or 2 helps but that's not really reliable.

2021-04-11 16:03:27,wallstreetbets,AMC has billions of debt though. GME has a very manageable debt.

2021-04-11 12:58:34,wallstreetbets,"Good points, thanks. 

I’m holding because there’s a non-insignificant change the vote doesn’t pass. Likely will but to be seen. 

Also, because my original thesis (Q2/3 earnings beating expectations) still holds and as you said the stock is disconnected from the fundamentals. It’s being marketed very heavily at the moment so I see no pressure to sell especially as I’ve taken profits already."
2021-04-11 12:50:27,wallstreetbets,In what world do you have access to the information that the share dilution will happen? Seems to me the general consensus is to vote no. So what part of your arse are you pulling that information from?
2021-04-11 10:27:02,wallstreetbets,"You bet, and feel free to challenge any of them as you learn more about any counter-points."
2021-04-11 10:32:55,wallstreetbets,"What would you consider the almost 4m bonus the CEO got in March, on top of his pay going from 10m~ in 19 to 20m~ in 21?

Where’s that on the scale"
2021-04-11 14:10:46,wallstreetbets,Name one
2021-04-11 10:21:41,wallstreetbets,Used to though. DDs used to mean something.
2021-04-11 11:55:40,wallstreetbets,Dumb ass
2021-04-11 12:20:14,wallstreetbets,"If you want your stonk to win wsb, make the most delicious memes"
2021-04-11 12:59:04,wallstreetbets,AMC is no where near as shorted as GME; they’re really not comparable
2021-04-11 12:37:18,wallstreetbets,"That's what I was thinking. Yes AMC financials haven't been great over the last couple of years, but I don't really think that affects the squeeze potential. VW was probably in the same boat when they had a squeeze. Gamestop was a company that should be bankrupt and wasn't all that liked by most gamers. The squeeze potential was there and that changed everything and now they're changing their business model. I see AMC squeezing similar to GME which is why I've been holding since January."
2021-04-11 11:28:46,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the corporate world.. He did technically help the company keep their head above water. Also his compensation is likely structured to give him incentives to stay when things are looking bleak so that the company doesn’t need to worry about losing its CEO amidst a crisis.
2021-04-11 12:32:28,wallstreetbets,Squeeze squeeze
2021-04-11 12:24:27,wallstreetbets,"It seems like AMC investors give GME investors love, but GME investors don't give any love to AMC investors."
2021-04-11 11:53:50,wallstreetbets,"Yes, less aggressive and more polite for sure. 

But also, if I may, quite oblivious as to the basics and oftentimes with less disposable income (not that all GME investors are rocking millions)."
2021-04-11 15:14:03,wallstreetbets,That's true. Everyone agrees movies SUCK these days. How many super hero movies can a person tolerate?
2021-04-11 15:09:16,wallstreetbets,"Soo.. just some of the highest-grossing movies of all time?

And as some whose basis is damn close to $2 I’d say I care deeply if the price is $10 or $15."
2021-04-11 15:16:32,wallstreetbets,This won't age well
2021-04-11 14:21:40,wallstreetbets,Another interesting strategy.
2021-04-11 10:37:51,wallstreetbets,Um apes don’t own 90% of the float you clown.
2021-04-11 17:38:59,wallstreetbets,"Right, that's what I've been trying to tell people for a couple weeks now. The sentiment grew by reputable DD'ers that were doing DD's on AMC, including Trey trades that the AMC on it's own has been delayed by months. A lot of them thought that it was on the verge of squeezing like GME, but that just wasn't the case. Now, I've been saying that AMC still has a chance for a nice big gamma squeeze that would be triggered by GME squeezing and getting the hedgies margin called. That AMC gamma squeeze could snowball into a full blow short squeeze for AMC. That is why I'm still bullish on the AMC squeeze. Not just AMC either. There will be other memestocks that may experience a big juicy gamma squeeze as well. It's going to be nutz."
2021-04-11 13:05:36,wallstreetbets,"Exactly little by little I sold off my 300 shares of AMC after I noticed I already made a lot off of it... I can only go with my gut that it’s done. So I sold and put over $3,000 in GME last week .. Even if I only gain $20 a share that’s way more than AMC will make"
2021-04-11 11:22:20,wallstreetbets,"GME is a lot risker, imo. Without squeeze potential GME is blockbuster."
2021-04-11 11:13:20,wallstreetbets,"God no. Trade stocks with a little over $2 basis for a dead cat that’s been bleeding for weeks now?

Don’t get me wrong, if that dead cat bounces once or twice this year I won’t be surprised. But AMC has a realistic possibility for a good boost to its price in Q2/Q3. GME is maybe a long term hold, if you believe Cohen will turn things upside down."
2021-04-11 10:36:23,wallstreetbets,"Ha, I'm long AMC. Bought last April though so you can imagine what my basis is. Initial thesis was to wait until April to get to long-term treatment on gains (provided stock recovers). 

But, I sold about a third of my initial investment when the stock rocketed in January to take some profits. The rest is in until Q3 or May vote on authorization of new shares. We'll see how either goes."
2021-04-11 15:46:51,wallstreetbets,"Because many fools are yolo’ing their life savings into this and GME and there’s no real discussion of the risks. 

Wsb used to discuss it all: the good the bad and the ugly. Now it’s an echo chamber."
2021-04-11 18:11:29,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t bashing. OP is right. Do you only want confirmation bias or would you like to actually see what could be working against us.

Bullish on the stock but I’m not going to just ignore everything that doesn’t send us to the moon..."
2021-04-11 11:00:05,wallstreetbets,"You want to look at day-to-day market cap and not averages. It was over 6b a couple days in 2017. I made the same mistake as you initially by the way and then dug deeper into data. 

My point is it’s overvalue at the moment because the cap is high compared even to highly profitable years."
2021-04-11 10:41:38,wallstreetbets,They don't have to disclose a deal like that beforehand. It's theoretically possible. Which is another reason why you may want to vote against it if you were a long-term shareholder. If they want your shares they can buy them in the open market. Most acquisitions result in current shareholders being offered a good premium for their shares.
2021-04-11 10:37:22,wallstreetbets,Sure. Blackrock isnt a “hedge fund” it’s one of the largest asset managers in the world and they have massive passive businesses including owning ishares. Thus they own everything the index tells them to own.
2021-04-11 10:25:35,wallstreetbets,"AMC stock price on Dec. 31, 2020 was $2.12/share, quite a bargain even taking the dilution into account. Of course it made sense to buy more shares at that point if you believed the pandemic will get under control in 2021. 

&#x200B;

Also, do you have reliable information they didn't exit any of their positions in Q1?"
2021-04-11 18:56:02,wallstreetbets,If read the full story you’d know I’ve sold a third of my position already in January and took profits. Holding the rest through earnings call.
2021-04-11 12:20:07,wallstreetbets,Switch to daily views for 2017. It was over 6b on multiple days. Made the same mistake looking at averages only.
2021-04-11 11:02:43,wallstreetbets,"I sure hope not. Love going to the movies with friends, it’s a different experience."
2021-04-11 10:53:24,wallstreetbets,"Is your thesis then that AMC has been undervalued for years?

Because their market cap was much much higher pre-dilution. So I’m not sure I see how increasing their shares 5x wouldn’t have caused the price per share to drop materially in normal times?"
2021-04-11 12:54:39,wallstreetbets,"Short ladders aren’t real. 

I’ve researched it as I had my doubts and there are many more factors pointing to it being a Reddit fiction than the other way around."
2021-04-11 10:50:16,wallstreetbets,Yikes mate. I’m long in the stock haha.

2021-04-11 14:27:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Should start looking at corn futures. There's gonna be a popcorn shortage!
2021-04-11 11:27:12,wallstreetbets,"I would agree that there is pent up demand, but is that sustainable? Folks haven't been to the movie theater in over a year and came out in droves to see King Kong vs Godzilla... however that doesn't necessarily indicate the establishment of a long term trend. 

Would probably need to see a consistent pattern of earnings at the box office before we can assume that they're out of the woods."
2021-04-11 16:32:13,wallstreetbets,"I mean  there is a strong blockbuster release schedule for theaters this summer

Also Hollywood Needs AMC

Christopher Nolan and others are supporting theaters because they are sick of getting skinned alive in direct streaming deals

AMC has both movies on demand and theaters as well as a growing social media following"
2021-04-11 13:25:09,wallstreetbets,And now blockbusters are streaming direct releases now. Puts on AMC.
2021-04-11 18:20:54,wallstreetbets,analysts plural? it was literally only one. the median analyst price target for amc is still $2 lol
2021-04-11 12:58:14,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Without squeeze it's easily a $20 stock & right now it's sitting below $10
2021-04-11 13:19:14,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense.  Based on your thesis, I'd consider temporarily exiting your position for the period of time leading up to and after the May 4th vote.  It's true there's a small chance the vote doesn't pass, but in most scenarios it passes, and share price will drop like a knife.  After which, you'll be able to buy in at a lower cost basis."
2021-04-11 13:13:20,wallstreetbets,"I'm not claiming it will ""definitely pass"".  I'm saying it will ""in all likelihood"" pass because raising additional money is in the best interest of long-term shareholders (due to AMC's balance sheet).  And, ultimately, both institutional votes and proxy retail votes will vote in the best interest of long-term shareholders."
2021-04-11 10:38:31,wallstreetbets,It's a tricky question. You want your talent (including C-suite) to stay on the ship and steer it. They did manage to get through a Covid year after all. I do think the comp was out of line with their achievements/overall results though.
2021-04-11 15:44:51,wallstreetbets,Nikola is worth something after being found as a fraud
2021-04-11 16:01:14,wallstreetbets,"CCIV, FSR no product with outrageous valuations. AMC is fair value in this market easily."
2021-04-11 10:51:36,wallstreetbets,"not for GME and AMC. And I made money off of both, but if you ever wanted to know how a cult begins in the first world, this was a fascinating study.

I'm not particularly long for AMC or GME but it doesn't mean it can't spike once or twice again before finally needing to rest.

If there is money to be made, you don't really need to have faith in the future."

2021-04-11 16:40:55,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-11 18:30:42,wallstreetbets,where are you getting the numbers from?
2021-04-11 13:14:48,wallstreetbets,"FWIW GME always had a solid balance sheet, just declining revenue. At one point their market cap was lower than the cash they had on hand (lol), so they were just just priced way too cheaply at $5 and HF over played their hand by over-shorting it and got trapped. Anyone who believes AMC is in the same situation is allergic to DD."
2021-04-11 12:59:56,wallstreetbets,My understanding is that AMC has never been (and definitely isn’t at the moment) as shorted as GME has been. So I see the probability of a squeeze as quite low.
2021-04-11 11:57:44,wallstreetbets,I feel like the only people that would invest in the company right now are the people easily persuaded to do stupid things. What type of person would invest in a company that consistently dilutes its shares and whose bond holders cashed out for stock during the last squeeze(not good for the long term perspective of the company imo)? 13b in debt after the last set of share dilution? Look at the 2021 10k... I shouldn’t have to say anymore. When is the vote date?
2021-04-11 15:12:30,wallstreetbets,Thats because a lot of GME investors bought at the peak and want people to rally and come save them. So they see AMC as a distraction from that.
2021-04-11 12:32:12,wallstreetbets,"So true.. This coming from a hybrid meme investor of gme/amc and a shit ton of penny stocks..

LFG!"
2021-04-11 17:50:59,wallstreetbets,None of those are the highest grossing movies of all time. When you get 1 blockbuster a year your killing the theaters. Prior to 2017 I used to go to the movies once or twice a month because there were a variety of new content coming out each month. Anyways the more you comment the more you sound like you short. Now that theaters survived covid people will be returning to the theaters. 30 bucks to watch a movie at home is too expensive. I’ll spend 25 or less for a ticket popcorn and drink opening day.

2021-04-11 16:15:27,wallstreetbets,"This is almost exactly what I did last week as well. Sold half of my AMC and put more into GME.

I would've preferred to not dip into the AMC and let it ride, but a) I'm less confident AMC will move much higher, though b) I have a fairly low average, around $5 and c) I bought a BUNCH of BB near the peak. Would be nice to have that chunk back, but I'll just let that ride long term."
2021-04-11 13:30:28,wallstreetbets,"More like Egghead Software. :) But GME is a lot healthier overall. No real debt, cash on hand, positive cash flow expected for 2021. Most importantly an opportunity to pivot. AMC is a bankruptcy waiting to happen. There is no way for them to pivot or dramatically change their business model."
2021-04-11 13:26:28,wallstreetbets,"Bruh you think GME is dead? We are finally in April, the following weeks will be very interesting, not just for GME but the entire stock market."
2021-04-11 10:44:14,wallstreetbets,Some of these “factors” pre-existed your April 2020 long position. So let me get this straight... you decided to purchase what was then a tanking stock that was in and out of facing bankruptcy? Makes sense.

2021-04-11 13:11:20,wallstreetbets,"My thesis is that if you think the sector is fairly valued, that AMC is currently undervalued based on price to 2019 sales, with current share dilution.

2021-04-11 12:20:48,wallstreetbets,It is significant as King Kong vs Godzilla is FREE on HBO Max.  So people are deciding to see a movie in theater they can watch at home for free. It beat the last movie in that franchise when theaters were at 100% compared to 60% capacity limits now.
2021-04-11 14:27:26,wallstreetbets,"You have to look at the attendance make up.  As of 2019 11% of frequent moviegoers (once or more a month) made up 47% of revenue.   58% of moderate movie goers ( 1 or more a year) combined with the frequent accounted for 78% of revenues.  

Those people will be dying to get back into theaters.  You also have to account for people are fucking tired of watching shit at home.  I think what we are going to see is that smaller budget films will probably stay on streaming, since they never tend to make much in theaters anyway, and big blockbusters will do better in theaters going forward.  Kong V Godzilla proved people paid to see it despite being able to get it for free."
2021-04-11 12:03:13,wallstreetbets,"People are wanting all the things they have been missing this last year, at the very least you can assume it will return to pre-covid attendance in the long term as nothing has changed. The short term people are going to see movies in mass, with the back log of movies not released in 2020 and the new movies coming out will drive people out."

2021-04-11 14:10:27,wallstreetbets,"Interesting thought. Thanks for sharing. 

I don’t think wash sale rules would apply to me here because I’ll sell at a gain so even if I repurchase the same security within 30 days I should be ok. Then if the price drops I can invest a certain smaller amount later and still ride the high. 

The only downside is losing the benefit of long term cap gain rates so need to weight it against the risk."

GameStop has to turn around their whole giant, antiquated business to e-commerce, an area that already has tons of competition and well known businesses that are already trusted in that sector. They’re looking at spending years trying to reorganize to compete when other companies have been already doing it for a decade. 

GameStop has nothing to offer that isn’t already being offered. And the stock is going to bleed until it drops another $100."

2021-04-11 13:28:58,wallstreetbets,This from a guy who did DD about GEO. A private prison company that has tanked over 50% in the last year and 25% in the last week. Good luck with that. There's numerous DD posts about the AMC squeeze. Maybe it doesn't happen but I think there are a lot of people who believe it will and the numbers back that up.
2021-04-11 18:06:20,wallstreetbets,AMC is actually very shorted. 72.87M shares shorted according to S3’s chart.
2021-04-11 15:13:23,wallstreetbets,I think so too
2021-04-11 19:40:42,wallstreetbets,"Or that GME had solid balance sheets and had over 130 percent of the stock shorted. AMC has never had near that level of short interest and the delusional people talking about it having some sort of ""dark market"" swap short position don't understand what the fuck they are talking about.

AMC became a meme stock based on nothing except people who missed the original GME squeeze and didn't have the money to make the GME play. Everyone thinks they are DFV investing in AMC but you're actually all just a walking billboard for why the avg person shouldn't be able to invest in anything mor complicated than index ETFs"

Get your facts straight or you will read as propaganda."
2021-04-11 10:49:58,wallstreetbets,I think the burden of proof should be on the person making the claim: you.
2021-04-11 10:47:38,wallstreetbets,Sure. Most of you are too poor to buy GME so I’m sure you don’t collectively own over 400 million shares of AMC :) we’ll see when the new holdings come out 5/15 that show institutional ownership.
2021-04-11 15:15:41,wallstreetbets,"GME is literally Block Buster waiting to happen. Movie theatres will be around for a while yet, you can drink at home so does that mean you never go to bars?"
2021-04-11 11:09:22,wallstreetbets,I think the most important factor is that the future of AMC depends on MORE than merely restoring it to its pre covid position. It’s pre covid position was not that of a robust and thriving company. Stopping the bleeding is step one but it needs a papa Cohen level vision to move forward IMO.
2021-04-11 10:47:55,wallstreetbets,"Of course I did. The share fell more than 50%, and there’s usually a boost to the price when the stock recovers. Why wouldn’t I snatch a stock that had a potential to gain 100% in a year?

My thesis was (and remains) that once Covid is over theaters will see a nice boost to their profits. I’m not holding AMC till retirement. This is my high risk high reward play. 

And by the way I already took significant profits in January when I sold a third of my investment."
2021-04-11 15:51:37,wallstreetbets,"And they would get mercilessly mocked for it.  

AMC is less than 0.5% of my portfolio right now. I’ve already recouped my cost and taken profits in January by selling a third. 

I like getting challenged, it makes my next play better. And I already got two interesting strategy suggestions from this post, so I don’t regret making it."
2021-04-11 10:58:54,wallstreetbets,I’m resting on the fact that they indicated in their 10k they have enough cash to last them through March 2022. I wasn’t planning on staying in longer than that anyway tbh. And when the theaters fully reopen they’ll hopefully be back on track anyway.
2021-04-11 10:46:09,wallstreetbets,No. You are wrong. Blackrock and Vanguard are two of the largest passive managers in the world and they don’t *actively* own these stocks
2021-04-11 10:34:51,wallstreetbets,Genuine answer - I didn't see Q1 results for institutional shareholding yet. If you have them handy I'd really like to see them.
2021-04-11 14:17:03,wallstreetbets,"I’m not in front of my computer but on ycharts if you drill down into the day-by-day view for March 2017 there were several days when the stock jumped to over 6b. Sorry can’t link it. 

That being said I think we can agree the point I was making in the post stands, ie the stock is valued at or above the levels it trades at in a very profitable year, which likely indicates its overvalued."
2021-04-11 11:08:06,wallstreetbets,Go stream Godzilla vs Kong then go watch it in theatres. You tell me which one is better. Nobody wants to stay in their house to watch movies after being caged in for over a year.
2021-04-11 11:16:07,wallstreetbets,"This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard, movie theatres aren’t going anywhere. The experience of watching a film on a big screen with big sound is irreplaceable. Maybe you just don’t like going to the movies? I know plenty of people who do and have gone on a regular basis, like myself. I have a 55” screen which still doesn’t do proper film viewing at a theatre justice."
2021-04-11 11:05:33,wallstreetbets,"I do think they need to pivot more towards luxury setups. AMC theaters with sofas and reclining chairs are the shit. 

Plus all the “rent a theater” options? Man I would have been happy as a clam when I was 10 if I could rent a screen for $100 to watch a movie with my buddies for my birthday."
2021-04-11 11:27:22,wallstreetbets,"I agree and think it’s such an important point to make because everyone looks at stock prices instead of prices adjusted for the dilution.

They did raise cash, so that helps the balance sheet somewhat and slows down the dilution, but they were bleeding money like crazy last year."
2021-04-11 13:12:58,wallstreetbets,"I'm actually looking at price to 2019 sales, and comparing it to the rest of the sector, using current shares outstanding, which is the diluted amount. The rest of the sector is about 4x, AMC is about 2.2.

You can't actually compare straight up prices in the sector, since they have different shares outstanding. But thanks for being bad at understanding share valuations."

2021-04-11 12:38:05,wallstreetbets,"It is significant sure. It's likely that there's high demand to see a movie in theaters right now because COVID cases are at a relative low. If we have a 4th wave, that might shift and the at home model might seem more attractive.

I'm not inherently anti-AMC. I'd just like to see a few more film releases happen before I draw a conclusion about future trends."
2021-04-11 15:56:58,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I could have torrented it in 4K for free and watched it at home but I paid to go watch it in IMAX because this is the best way to watch it and I wanted to go out
2021-04-11 15:48:25,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure dying to get back into theaters translates into a trend of long term attendance. COVID presented families an opportunity to experience things differently from home. Families might have realized that it is more cost effective to stream a movie from home rather than go to a theater.  At my local AMC, the cost for a family of 4 (2 Adults, 2 Kids) to go see Godzilla vs Kong is $62.56 and that's not including any refreshments.

A key metric to lookout for is if this surge of movie attendance is sustained."
2021-04-11 12:10:00,wallstreetbets,"Just because I've been missing out on something doesn't mean I'm going to do that all the time. I haven't been to a restaurant in over a year... but when I do go it doesn't mean I'm going to eat out every single day. There is a limit and same applies to movies.

Pre-Covid attendance isn't something I'd be particularly motivated about either it's been consistently dropping YoY.

Short term yes we'll probably see a spike as people get that itch to see a movie in theaters out of their system.  But I'd like to see a couple more major releases that have positive turnout before I start becoming more optimistic about the company's future."
2021-04-11 19:09:47,wallstreetbets,"and my use of the term ""delusional cultists"" is justified because there are so many people on here just like you who don't have any evidence to back up their claims, just like here all you did was try to personally attack me instead of providing any evidence. i can't say for certain whether stocks like amc/gme (or any stock) will go up or down. anyone who says they can is a liar. the best anyone can offer is a guess. i wish you good luck in your trades, just make sure to engage in critical thinking."

2021-04-11 19:22:45,wallstreetbets,"You also said it was done after it hit $40 again and look where it is now. Point being, you know absolutely nothing about GME it seems Lol."
2021-04-11 19:01:37,wallstreetbets,"Lol , lmao."
2021-04-11 14:08:34,wallstreetbets,AMC IS in the same situation as GME with the over short positions. You just can’t see it because they too are hidden in swaps.
2021-04-11 14:10:23,wallstreetbets,"Again, they are using the exact same posts that they used in the early days of GME. (Insert ticker symbol here).  GME and AMC will squeeze. We just don’t know when."
2021-04-11 18:32:57,wallstreetbets,"That’s not relative data though because movie theaters don’t see any profits until after the first month of the movie being released.  The first 30 days a movie is released 80% of the ticket sales goes to the actual movie company while 20% goes to the theater. After that the theaters make 80% to 100% of the ticket sales depending on their agreement. Most of those box office gross amounts go to the company that made the movie and actors and crew. So you can’t really use a movies performance at the box office to gauge how the theaters are doing. Luckily all of the companies that own the theaters let their agreements expire in 2020. 
So now they can go demand a shorter timeframe maybe 15 to 17 days after a release before they get the full ticket revenue or a larger percentage of ticket sales maybe a 60/40 split. But still you’re going to see a huge resurgence in global cinema attendance that none of your points actually matter unless your on the short side of the trade."
2021-04-11 11:03:28,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough.  I'll try to find where I saw this

Also wasn't being a dick. Was genuinely asking"
2021-04-11 10:54:46,wallstreetbets,"Ud b surprised I've seen Apes with some girthy amounts of AMC . 

Also there is no need to put other apes down bcuz they can't afford or chose to go with AMC. You are just buying into the fud to divide apes. 

I wish you success on all your positions."
2021-04-11 16:27:00,wallstreetbets,"Look at it another way. AMC has around $6 billion dollars in corporate debt, around $12 per share. That means if a share was given to you for free you'd be starting $12 in the hole. Their prospects of digging out of that hole are slim given their revenue/profit when they were at full steam in 2018 and 2019. Experts say it might take until 2023 or 2024 to get their revenue back up to 2019 numbers.

AMC is a great short term play because most retail investors don't understand the fundamentals, they see good ticket sales for a movie, and $$$ appears in their eyes. But like I said previously don't get stuck holding the bags."
2021-04-11 11:10:34,wallstreetbets,I agree. They need innovation/pivoting and I think they will be great
2021-04-11 10:50:29,wallstreetbets,Also had the potential to go bankrupt. You’re telling people DD doesn’t exist in many of these threads but here you were of April 2020 throwing a straight gamble out
2021-04-11 19:31:41,wallstreetbets,"Yup totally sound advice and analysis. 


I think the AMC squeeze is over for now. I entered at 5.90 just a handful of shares, exited half at 11.88 and holding the other half for a 14.80 exit. Came real close recently but just gotta be patient. 


Do I expect it to hit that? *Shrug* highly unlikely will we see a gamma squeeze like what happened previously."
2021-04-11 12:34:23,wallstreetbets,Very true. Thank you for the feedback.
2021-04-11 10:56:46,wallstreetbets,So you mean the fact that they have more passiv managed assets than active means they have no actively managed ones? 😅
2021-04-11 10:47:39,wallstreetbets,"The last thing I saw was this 

2021-02-10 - BlackRock Inc. has filed an SC 13G/A form with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosing ownership of 5,926,369 shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (US:AMC). This represents 2.1 percent ownership of the company. In their previous filing dated 2021-02-02, BlackRock Inc. had reported owning 6,211,222 shares, indicating a decrease of -4.59 percent. So ok they sold some shares at this moment but man why wouldn’t they sell more if they don’t think there is More to earn ?"

2021-04-11 11:24:13,wallstreetbets,Nothing compares to the bone rattling volume at the theatres.
2021-04-11 11:18:51,wallstreetbets,"People said the same thing when VHS came out. 

Number of Americans who went to theater regularly dropped from 30% to less than 10% since 1980s. 

Less and less people go to theaters with streaming available. It’s over."
2021-04-11 14:20:36,wallstreetbets,"What are you comparing? Can you straigh up write the equation?

If you’re looking at pure market cap vs sales that’s one thing. But it sounds like you’re comparing price per share (from a period when AMC had 1/4 of the current amount of shares issued) to sales vs where the price is now. It just seems like you’re discounting the fact AMC has 4x the shares it did in 2019."
2021-04-11 14:17:59,wallstreetbets,"Another point that often gets missed that debt to sales is about equal for both AMC and cinemark, with cinemark having most of the debt due in 2022/2023, while AMC has pushed most of theirs to 2026. 

Although it's no longer the deep value that it was at $2-3, I still think it's slightly undervalued. They have lots of monetization opportunities with streaming services (e.g. buy a ticket for movie X, get a free stream for movie Y), but until they move in that direction, I'll leave it as about 30% undervalued."
2021-04-11 11:56:12,wallstreetbets,Lol idc I’m just meme ing on you
2021-04-11 15:54:14,wallstreetbets,$62 is an absolute bargain for a family activity.
2021-04-11 17:48:12,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry but you deffinietly seem to be anti AMC. Firstly its not always about the cost. its about the comfort of being in a cinema and having no distractions. A super massive wide screen where you can enjgine doby surround sound and some theatres even had 4D movie experiences. Theatre and also being kept at home from COVID will ensure the suvival of AMC.   


Lets say theatres were taken away and the only thing you couuld do was watch movies from home. You'd get very bored if every movie you watched was on a sensibly and not overly sized tv."
2021-04-11 16:45:06,wallstreetbets,"Plus, lots of people have relocated to more suburban areas with larger homes during COVID. For every person who upgraded to a home with a dedicated TV room with 4K and Atmos, there is probably some fractional reduction in ticket sales.

Add to that how many people spent their stimmy on home theater upgrades, and I could see a sustained reduction in demand over time due to COVID, especially after an initial uptick in revenues due to people wanting to get out."
2021-04-11 14:30:47,wallstreetbets,"It wasn't really falling.  Since 2002, yes but the last 5 years it has consistently ranged between 1.2 billion tickets sold and 1.3 billion tickets sold and that is North America alone."
2021-04-11 15:44:43,wallstreetbets,"My 2 cents. I think technology changes due to covid have changed the way people think about movies. I haven’t been to a movie theater in a decade. Maybe it’s because I don’t give a shit about Hollywood anyway, but wouldn’t you just rather watch a movie at home thru streaming?"

Why would that trend suddenly reverse on a long term basis simply because we had a pandemic? Short term, absolutely can see people going back out and enjoying a movie. But not sure if that's sustainable though.

While you may be motivated to go for those reasons, not everyone is motivated by those."
2021-04-11 15:25:29,wallstreetbets,"That is literally the definition of falling. 

2002 had 1,575,754,768 tickets sold

2019 had 1,228,767,434 tickets sold

The only reason box office revenue has gone up is because during that same time average ticket prices increased from $5.81 to $9.16.

It's going to be interesting to see if they can pull through. The company has a lot of debt and needs a best case scenario for pretty much every release in order to have a prayer at surviving."

2021-04-11 15:54:00,wallstreetbets,Technology as well as cost. Movies are expensive if you're going out as a family. Could easily spend upwards of $100 for a family of four based on ticket prices and concessions. Why do that when you can spend a fraction of the price and view the movie at home?
2021-04-11 14:18:31,wallstreetbets,And? I know plenty of people that still won't leave the house.

2021-04-11 19:20:25,wallstreetbets,It’s not cherry picking. You’re trying to tie a theaters revenue to how well a movie does at the box office which isn’t directly correlated. There’s a small indirect correlation however it’s not a major determining factor in a theaters revenue stream. Putting asses in seats is the major determining factor and so is concession sales. The theater is still going to get their revenue regardless of the movie is successful or a flop. The resilience of this company to continuously stave off bankruptcy even when they had zero revenue for 3 quarters in a row. The volume this stock trades daily you will effectively see little to no change in the share price whenever new stock is issued because the volume is two to three times that amount is being traded daily. I have confidence the debt will be remediated in a year and expenses will be cut especially if the company cuts their markup from 300% on both tickets and concessions. If they can effectively provide better prices than Warner brothers and Disney then there is no point to stay at home for new releases.
2021-04-11 12:42:47,wallstreetbets,"It is what it is. 🤷 I'm just tired of the bickering between Apes on it.  GME is not the only stock that will b affected when the MOASS happens.

They are doing a shelf offering upthread for another 500 million shares. Somebody said the CEO stated that did not mean they would dilute immediately, but if they weren't going to use it why are they filing it. He probably just wants you to keep your shares so he can sell his shares prior to the dilution."

We have a big tv & surround sound but you can’t replicate that at home. I’m a (paid) rewards member of AMC & we go to the movies a few times a month & stream at home too.
Imo streaming at home is good for some things but it’s like listening to music at home vs going to a concert, just BEING there immersed in the environment makes it that much better."

2021-04-11 18:27:21,wallstreetbets,"You sound like someone who bought in at $20 a share and are desperate for validation. For fucks sake dude, instead of impugning on my character, why don't you offer a cogent argument in support of your stock.

Industries change. While there may be a cohort that wants to see new movies in theaters, it is become cost prohibitively expensive for others which is where streaming becomes a viable option."
2021-04-11 11:09:02,wallstreetbets,Then why did you only sell 1/3rd of the position when it went sky high compared to your cost basis? Now you’re saying your long on a company who you consider is over-valued? Lol which one is it? Why not sell now and make huge gains? I just think your full of crap that’s all.

Honesty you are an any Scot"
2021-04-11 11:11:48,wallstreetbets,"Greed. GME just went through the roof and there were signs pointing to a squeeze with AMC as well. Didn’t want to miss the hype train, but I wanted to recoup some of the gains. 

I should have said “medium term”, if I was being precise. I will likely sell this year."
2021-04-11 18:44:17,wallstreetbets,"So you were winning. Averaged up and are now currently losing money... that sound about right?

My dude have you actually been reading anything I've been saying? I'm being a realist. The fact is less people have been going to movies since 2002 and online streaming options provide people with a cheaper option.

Had to Google what high street was and I'm still not sure what you mean. E-Commerce is changing the way we shop. Why don't you try walking into a Circuit City or Sears these days and tell me how they are doing.

If I had to pick a theater stock to back, I'd go with Cinemark as they have a much better balance sheet, have much less debt and are more likely to come out the other end of this okay."
2021-04-11 18:45:35,wallstreetbets,So let me ask you this. Do you even own any of the stocks involved?
2021-04-11 18:50:31,wallstreetbets,Does it matter? I'm entitled to an opinion and this isn't an echo chamber where everyone thinks the same way.
2021-04-11 18:53:24,wallstreetbets,It’s more of the data and facts. You might have given up on going to films. Granted before covid I’d have agreed. However with the introductions of good new movies and also support from the film studios... cinemas are on the way back. People want to be out and about to experience the experiences. My long term is 2-10 years. Short term would be 1. So to think people would choose the cheaper option is like saying you can buy a Mercedes for 55k but equally it’s fine you can buy a fiat punto at a much cheaper price it does the same thing.
2021-04-11 19:04:59,wallstreetbets,"What data do you have to support this? I never said I've given up going to films. But it's gonna take me awhile before I go back.

People do choose the cheaper options all the time. Especially now in the age of COVID where so many people are/were unemployed. Money is tight and people are saving. Now economic recovery and full employment will help... but the biggest driver will be successful achieving herd immunity through the vaccine rollout. A fourth wave would be bad.

I'm more concerned about the 11 billion dollars of debt that AMC has to service to include 6 billion of non-convertible debt that comes due in 2026.

This stock needs all the help it can get."

Similar to open source where all bugs are shallow when you have enough eyes, crowdsourcing info has a great chance to find consensus with a variety of viewpoints and product quality.  Combine that with the forces that work in /r/whatisthisthing and you have a good recipe on your hands.

But more importantly the WSB crowd has something that average regular retail doesn't, and that's discipline.  Retail is filled with cowards and stop losses while WSB is filled with fearless maniacs.  Over the long haul value investment delivers and high risk delivers.  You can't get shy just because you take a loss, and the apes in here aren't shy at all.

2021-04-11 12:16:54,wallstreetbets,"“We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled”. 


I don’t know about you guys but I’m here for those whopping 1.1% weekly gains. The “research” paper is a paragraph long. Couldn’t find how they got these numbers."

It’s an interesting correlation, but even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while. The study doesn’t measure the impact of what those potential recommendations have on the volume of trades. Meaning does having 9 million potential buyers have an undue influence on price.

Nor does the study seem to address the upward trend of the market. My managed portfolio has had ~7% upward growth in the same period. Meaning the market is doing well and has little to do with capitalizing on opportunities. Assuming you started investing in 2019... you could pick any number of stocks and seen decent gains between then and now. That doesn’t point toward any skill or informed decision."

Literally the virgin Brokerage vs The Chad retard who yolos 50k and admits it was a shit decision inatead of blaiming some random factor. They really thought people here were just picking stocks without research.  Delusional
2021-04-11 14:24:26,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't exactly call it skilled and responsible for putting all of my money into a stock because I get a good laugh from gorilla and diamond hand memes.

Because all the people I know who make trades for the banks not the other way around have either a master's or PhD in some kind of science, CS, or statistical field. 

I'm totally not qualified to speak on their behalf but in layman's terms all the people I know my bank hires are employees who would code/create algorithms as virtually no one did any trading themselves. Every single posting I've ever seen in cap markets in trading required at least some form of finance like a CFA designation or degree + some kind of coding or data science background. Not to mention since everyone applies for these jobs you'll never get in unless you have connections + the qualifications."

Like even vaccines for Covid - the Pfizer & Moderna are basically the same but the former much harder to distribute bcz it needs to be kept super cold, a big problem for poorer countries. But if the two companies were aiming to get medicine where needed rather than maximize their own profits, Moderna could just tell Pfizer how to make the RNA vaccine without it needing to be so cold & we could focus on delivering more of the better (easier to distribute) vaccine where it's needed. Everyone healthier & safe from the pandemic around the world is good news from the economy & productivity to say nothing of the lives (and potential for labor & innovation) saved. Have you seen how some clever people in poor countries will use like scrap electronics to build like a radio tower for their village or other awesome stuff they need?

demand stayed constant or grew another 5% during that time.


it takes 1-2 years to increase output beyond 100% during a normal year. 


How long will it take before you catch up with current demand and then make up for the lost production. Mind you the government is still issuing unemployment checks above the median income for people that made 20% below.

2021-04-11 13:29:21,wallstreetbets,"Demand for a lot of things decreased, not increased. Supply was just even lower. For a lot of companies it won’t take even close to a year to return to regular production.

The fallacy that unemployment cheques keep people from working is absurd, it also only applies to the poorest workers as you said, the jobs of which will be replaced in a heartbeat regardless of cheques, and this doesn’t reflect productivity for most companies, this was just consumer facing focus. Oil companies aren’t going to have trouble ramping production back up because some minimum wage workers don’t want to return to work right away."
2021-04-11 14:01:45,wallstreetbets,"I mean let’s say real 2% inflation for one or two years sucks for sure, but it wouldn’t be that bad overall. Poor people would get shafted as usual though."
2021-04-11 15:15:40,wallstreetbets,"It’s temporary because as demand surges and prices increase, businesses will respond to that price signal and profit motive by increasing production and hiring back employees. Inflation cannot meaningfully increase until unemployment goes back down to where we were and more. Having more employees to hire is like having money in the bank. You can’t go broke until that’s used up first."

2021-04-11 13:37:04,wallstreetbets,"Truthfully because we have kids. You have to get to our closet through our bathroom, so we can have a few locked doors between the main hallway and the closet."

2021-04-11 12:11:25,wallstreetbets,You should see a doctor if later doesn't cum in 4 hours

2021-04-11 16:48:55,wallstreetbets,Is this something I need to defend or is it just more BS ?
2021-04-11 16:20:30,wallstreetbets,Ha. I see what you did there.
2021-04-11 13:53:21,wallstreetbets,"Idk I feel like if you're in a place where there is no second hand risk, like outside or on a deck; then why is it any different than drinking a beer or smoking a cigarette? I wouldn't want to be drunk or stoned in front of my kid, but I don't see anything wrong with them seeing me smoke a joint. Seems like if anything it's better for them to get a model of responcible consumption of inhebrients while there younger before they're exposed to it on their own without any parents around to display reasonable useage"
2021-04-11 14:14:40,wallstreetbets,Saw some dude smoking a cig with his baby in his arm so his face was right in the cig smoke. Ugh.
2021-04-11 14:11:41,wallstreetbets,"Is it ok to drink in front of them, though?"
2021-04-11 15:06:30,wallstreetbets,"My sister and brother in law just had a child and also adopted an 11 year old due to her former living circumstances. She knows what weed is, she knows that we smoke it and she also respects us by staying inside while we go out on the back patio to toke.

I would never smoke in an enclosed environment around a child or anyone who doesn’t smoke for that matter, but I think the stigma around parents using cannabis needs to stop.

My dad used to get absolutely plastered in front of us and no one batted an eye, you know?"
2021-04-11 18:00:34,wallstreetbets,I do agree I don’t understand the difference between drinking in front of your kids and smoking in front of your kids. Albeit when they’re of an appropriate age obviously
2021-04-11 18:41:39,wallstreetbets,"Ugh this reminds me of this dude my ex's friend was hooking up with. He'd smoke in front of his 3 or 4 year old son so often that the kid knew were the stash was and would waddle over to it. Then he'd go ""haha the little man wants go spark up with me"" and I saw him try to blow smoke into the kids face on more than one occasion which was met with a resounding ""nah id never do that"" when yelled at for it. Luckily he got into some trouble and I think lost custody completely."
2021-04-11 14:34:10,wallstreetbets,I'm just gonna say sense of smell is strongly tied to memory. I knew what weed smelled like from the young age of 4 or so. I didn't know what weed was until I was 14. I started smoking weed frequently at 15 as both my parents smoked so I never thought there was anything wrong with it.(turns out it's a problem when you smoke everyday multiple times) My parents didn't smoke in front of me but did smoke in the house and didn't even try to hide it.  Now that I'm a parent I never smoke near or around my children. I actually quit smoking weed about a month ago. I may pick it back up. I may not. But if I do I'll be only smoking outside or in the garage
2021-04-11 14:53:23,wallstreetbets,The logic is if you dotn think it’s bad you dotn hide it. If you think it’s bad maybe you shouldn’t do it.
2021-04-11 17:16:23,wallstreetbets,This is still the norm in Iowa...

2021-04-11 16:50:05,wallstreetbets,Just more BS I think. User won't even pretend to read the posts.
2021-04-11 14:04:34,wallstreetbets,That's an exceptionally reasonable and forward thinking viewpoint... You fucking hippie! I said I won't have it not in my house! I don't care what you read on the internet. That shit is disgusting and you'll follow my rules while under my roof!
2021-04-11 14:01:37,wallstreetbets,I agree with this especially where it’s legal. At that point what’s the difference from a glass of wine?
2021-04-11 18:01:00,wallstreetbets,"It is different to drinking a beer, because kids drink stuff too. I would never smoke anything around my (future) kids, cigarettes or bud"
2021-04-11 14:16:17,wallstreetbets,You should see the messages I’m getting.. I believe I triggered many parents..
2021-04-11 14:27:50,wallstreetbets,"Personally I think it’s better to drink in front of a child than smoke, just because the smell of marijuana can be offensive as well as smoke, compared to the smell of a glass of wine"
2021-04-11 14:34:05,wallstreetbets,"Secondhand smoke is bad for everyone and, in pot’s case, might also get your kid stoned.  

I don’t think it’s bad to be a little stoned in front of your kids,  but I wouldn’t want to smoke around them."
2021-04-11 15:27:29,wallstreetbets,"There no reason it should be treated as a worse alternative to alcohol. I feel like a lot of these people arguing against it are just stigmatized because of their parents (Or have never smoked). 

Like yeah no shit you don’t blow tokes into your kids face, but a lot of their reasoning for hiding it from them seems to be “I don’t like the smell”.

Like go ahead and don’t toke in front of your kids, but you’d be a hypocrite if you still drank or smoked cigs in front of them."

2021-04-11 11:10:51,wallstreetbets,"Cathie Wood bought the dip in the millions of shares on March 24, 2021.

Thanks to Wikipedia, we know that Cathie  lives in [Wilton, Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilton,_Connecticut). She is divorced from Robert Wood, who died in 2018. Wonder if she is single? She has three children: Caitlin, Caroline, and Robert. She enjoys walking and usually goes for a walk after 5 hours of virtual meetings each morning.[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathie_Wood#cite_note-citywire-17)She typically wakes up at 7:00AM and begins reading research. Whatever that is.

Wood is a devout Christian. She reads the [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible) every morning while brewing coffee and is an active member of her local church. I wonder if the historical Jesus drank coffee?

Wood supported [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump)'s presidential re-election in 2020, ""from a strict economic view.""  Because morals have nothing to do with money. Obvz.  Wood said she had worries of increased [capital gains taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax) and new taxes on unrealized gains under a [Joe Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden) administration, but said after the election that her worries were quelled as she considers these changes unlikely.  Because rich people control America, always have, and always will.

In 2018, she donated funds to her high school to start the Duddy Innovation Institute, which encourages girls to study [disruptive innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation).[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathie_Wood#cite_note-duddy-8)Which makes her totally awesome.

2021-04-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"If you expect to become a multi-millionaire soon, take advantage NOW and save yourself from millions of dollars(or bananas) in taxes So, this is kind of a specific scenario, but I think it's one that a lot of Redditor's find ourselves in, so I figured i'd share my thoughts on how to protect a portion of any gains if you expect to make a ton in the near future. Look at any millionaire/billionaire/trillionaire in the news and you can be sure they're protecting their companies and investments from any unnecessary tax liabilities, and the same should apply for apes who are investing. If you're going to be a millionaire soon, you need to start thinking like a millionaire and planning so that you can reduce the amount that you'll owe. NOW in particular because there's a deadline for this, especially if you fit the following scenario.

\---*This particular tax-scenario might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so pay attention and do your own research. This isn't tax or financial advice, so please reach out to someone who can help you navigate all the rules, but you still have time to look into it if you want to save some bananas. ---*

Most of us retail traders are people who are scraping by, or maybe living comfortably but definitely not buying yachts on the weekend, or running hedge funds attempting to short companies into bankruptcy. That means you probably have a job where you report to most days, and take home a paycheck that gets taxed before it hits your bank account. If your income is below a certain threshold, and you have some extra money sitting around, you're allowed to put those already-taxed dollars into a retirement account and allow it to grow tax-free on a number of securities or assets(including stocks and even property), and the IRS doesn't mind since they don't expect you to take a couple of dollars and have that investment multiply exponentially. Notably, these retirement accounts allow you to invest into any stock, which *includes* stock in your favorite company. Any capital gains (let's say gains in a normal Robinhood account) are ordinarily taxed as a short-term or long-term capital gain depending how long you held those shares in your account(up to 37% depending on your gains and tax bracket), but if you were to buy/sell an IRA, you get to keep ALL of those gains in your IRA tax-free, regardless of short-vs-long-term holding or percentage gain. The caveat is that you're only allowed to make contributions up to a certain dollar amount (and you're only allowed to contribute to a Roth IRA up to a specific income level in a tax year).

The income limits for contributions into a Roth IRA in the 2020 tax-season are **$124,000 for a single-filer**(which let's be honest most of us are single anyways), and you're allowed to contribute **up to $6,000** in either a Traditional or a Roth IRA. But wait, we're already in 2021, and we left 2020(along with all the shutdowns, quarantines and the Tiger King) in the past, right? Well, the IRS allows you to make contributions to an IRA *up until* the tax filing deadline. For this year, they went ahead and gave us a blessing in disguise and extended the filing deadline to **May 17th 2021**, so you have an extra month to plan your taxes, and there's still time to take advantage of this tax-blessing. If you plan on becoming a millionaire from selling any stocks this year, you WOULD NOT be able to make contributions for the 2021 tax season in the Roth IRA example since your income would put you in a much higher tax bracket than the one for 2020, so this specific scenario is a limited-time offer, not redeemable in the future. Theoretically, you could take a couple dollars that you have lying around, fund an IRA account and let that money grow tax-free until you're old and wrinkly, then buy a tax-free Space-Tesla at retirement age with your gains.

Let's take a look at an example for a best case scenario in an ape-market and and an ape stock-exchange:

* Let's say your favorite ape stock last closed at \~158 bananas a share. You could take $6,000 that you had sitting around in an account and drop that into an IRA
* Let's assume bananas are $1 each on the open market. You could theoretically take those $6,000 and purchase 6,000 bananas in your IRA as an investment asset
* You could then setup a limit order in your IRA to execute if the price of that ape-stock were to drop a bit on Monday morning, let's say to 157.89 bananas for sh!ts and giggles(.89 bananas are those little stringy things that all apes peel off before eating them)
* If that order executes, you'd get a nice round number of 12 ape-shares to hold in your IRA
* You could then go file your taxes for 2020, and claim this contribution to lock in your future gains tax-free.
* Hypothetically, the aforementioned ape stock could shoot up in value into stratospheric levels never before seen in the history of the ape-market. If you were to sell them all at ohhh idk, let's say 1,000,000 bananas each, this IRA would save you about $4.4 million in taxes after exchanging those bananas back into U.S. Dollars because the IRS doesn't accept bananas as payment, just FYI
* If you somehow managed to sell each ape-share for 10,000,000 bananas, you'd be saving yourself about $44.3 million in taxes
   * On the math: If you were to sell your assets for a net gain, you'd reduce that amount by your initial investment(cost basis), and the rest would be considered a capital gain. For a short-term capital gain in a typical cash or margin account in 2021, you'd owe a cumulative tax amount(35%) on the first $523,600, and anything above that is taxed at 37% for the examples above(single-filer)
   * On a $12,000,000 order execution from above, that tax works out to $4,406,802.25
   * On a $120,000,000 order execution from above, that tax works out to $44,366,802.25
   * [Tax Brackets](https://www.policygenius.com/taxes/tax-brackets/)

It's important to note that you can only fund the account with cash, so you can't transfer any shares that you already own into the account. This has to do with the fact that you'd have unrealized losses and gains in those shares, which would create a tax-nightmare for the IRS's purposes, so you'll need to transfer cash(or a check equivalent) into your account before being able to use the IRA, but hopefully you all have some money set aside for buying any dips in the market (if there were to hypothetically be a synthetic fire-sale in the future created by hedge funds). You'll need to do some research on which type of IRA is best for you, and all the rules regarding funding the account, but it seems like a Roth IRA has more favorable conditions, although a Traditional IRA allows you to deduct those $6,000 from your taxes so start reading and see what works for you. You won't be able to touch that money until you're 59-1/2(or after a 5-year holding period if you're a wise-old-ape who is nearing retirement age, which also allows a max contribution of $7,000), but that shouldn't be a problem if you make millions in gains in the near future, just don't keep your entire portfolio in it or you'd be creating a taxable event if you wanted to withdraw any money early. There are qualified exemptions like withdrawing for certain educational expenses, purchasing your first home, certain medical expenses, and other unforseen expenses, but you'll need to do some research if you think you may want to use any of those exemptions.

If you have Fidelity, it couldn't be easier to setup the account. I setup my main brokerage account a couple days ago and when the lightbulb went off in my ape-brain, I went to my account, submitted an application(which was pre-filled with all my account info), and I had the account setup in like 5 minutes, ready to be funded (other brokerages may take longer to open an account, that was just my experience with Fidelity). Thankfully i'm a procrastinator and haven't filed my taxes yet, but if you've already filed your taxes for 2020, you should still be able to take advantage of this with an amended tax return, just make sure you talk to a tax-professional who can guide you through it or submit paperwork on your behalf.

Hopefully we all see life-changing amounts of money hitting our bank accounts this year, and if this scenario sounds like you, please do some research and consider opening a tax-sheltered IRA. Your future self will thank you, and you can still hold onto your stock in your main brokerage accounts, just make sure you're aware of any tax implications coming down the line. I have another post for dealing with any gains in your main spending account coming soon, so stay tuned for that and good luck!

This is not a financial plan and any positions or scenarios outlined above are purely hypothetical and are not meant to be used as a guide on executing positions, buy/sell orders, timing the market or as an implied price ceiling for any individual securities. Investing involves risk including the possible loss of principle. Any investment should be assessed for risk-tolerance, financial objectives, and the financial circumstances of the individual investor, along with any associated tax-implications. Do not invest what you aren't willing to lose. Read and follow all the relevant tax rules/regulations related to IRA's and other tax-sheltered investment vehicles. I am a regular Ape who barely knows how to read, so talk to a Financial-Ape or a Tax-Ape if you want to save some bananas on your Ape-taxes. ---*

TLDR: If you made less than $124,000 in 2020 as a single-filer, you can put $6,000 into an IRA and any gains from buying/selling your favorite stock would be kept tax-free. The deadline for funding an IRA for the 2020 tax season is May 17th 2021. Tax situations are wildly different for each individual ape, so do your own research and talk to a tax-professional to see if you can reduce your tax liability, ESPECIALLY if you expect to make any trades this year that would put you in a different tax bracket for 2021

2021-04-11 01:39:43,wallstreetbets,"Or you could just say:

 “everyone should open a ROTH IRA. Asap. With Fidelity if you want to trade options in it. 

And even though there’s an income limit, you can skirt it—100% legally—by first putting it into a standard Ira then transferring it to a ROTH—which any brokerage will help you with and takes like 3minutes.

A ROTH is a tax shelter of sorts and is incredibly important.

2021-04-11 07:38:02,wallstreetbets,I'm kinda confused..wouldn't you have to wait until you're old for it not to be taxed when you withdraw? So basically you're just letting your money sit there until you're about to die?

I open Roth IRA, put in 6k dollars... Buy 6k dollars worth of GME shares with it? Then I don't own taxes on those specific shares.

And if I don't do it now I can't do it next year because I'll have earned too much? Basically Roth IRA are only for low earners?

Or did I not understand correctly."

Additionally, if you have concerns about the government wanting access to these banana gains in the future and changing the tax laws to get them, that is unlikely.

2021-04-11 01:51:20,wallstreetbets,Pay your taxes now on retirement.. b4 getting buck futted. Mainly your 401k. If we think repayment will be massive scale tax hikes for 20 years and you retire in the next 5-10. Then take the pain now vs later
2021-04-11 16:22:25,wallstreetbets,With absolutely no consideration given to the fact that maybe if we are making millions in the stock market we’d like to live off this and not take it out when we’re 60

2021-04-11 10:55:45,wallstreetbets,You have to recharacterize your contribution and percentage gains to a trad IRA if you had a huge gain in your roth as well as your taxable account. Theres no income limit on contributing to a traditional IRA. But there is a limit on claiming it against your AGI. You will get no deduction on your taxes if youre over the income limit.

2021-04-11 04:30:34,wallstreetbets,"His math is fuzzy but $6000 is about 40 shares, give or take. If you sold those 40 shares holding in a Roth IRA, you will not have to get taxed on it. So if you were to sell at $1 million/share, you will have $40 million sitting in the Roth IRA. Normally in a regular account, that would be taxed at a minimum of 37%, so you'll pay $14.8 million in the tax year you took your gains. The bonus of a Roth IRA is that it is exempt from taxation as long as you don't withdraw the funds prematurely. So if you live long and old enough to benefit from the Roth IRA, you can save yourself $14 at LEAST."

You wont be able to claim the trad IRA deduction on your taxes, as you wont qualify for that either. Only the percentage of your account that held GME will be counted towards your gains on recharacterization, so if you had 20k, 5k was in GME, and you made 50k, only 25% of the 50k plus the 6k contribution will move to your traditional IRA.

2021-04-11 13:50:56,wallstreetbets,"Those withdrawals are still taxed, they just avoid the 10% penalty for early withdrawals on earning. You can take out contributions from a Roth IRA tax free, but the whole point of this thread is that OP thinks they found a cheat code to make millions off of a very small initial sum and not pay any taxes on it. This is only true if you're 59 1/2 or older or you're permanently disabled.

The max amount you can take out for the first time homebuyer exception is 10k of earnings (and obviously whatever contributions you've made). 

I'm not trying to disparage Roths, they're great retirement investment vehicles. But people should be aware that the money they put into one won't be readily available without tax liability plus a 10% penalty until retirement."
2021-04-11 11:52:29,wallstreetbets,welp there goes my hopes and dreams
2021-04-11 11:07:20,wallstreetbets,"That's the point, you can move from one FD to another, and never pay any taxes until you take it out.

Say I made $1M on TSLA, sold it all, then doubled it on GME.  My tax rate on short term gains is 50% because I live in CA.

- Roth: I have 2M, withdraw and pay 10% penalty, then 50% tax = 2M * .9 * .5 = 900k left.
- Taxable: Pay 50% tax on TSLA gains, then 50% tax on GME gains = 1M * .5 * 2 * .5 = 500k left.

Yes, typically you want to avoid ever withdrawing early from the Roth - but that's easy, if you need the money you either spend more from your paycheck, or take a loan.  In the above scenario, I would never turn the 2M in the Roth into 900k in my pocket, instead I'd get a loan for 900k.  The extra 1.1M that I'd keep in the Roth in a conservative boomer fund would easily pay for the interest on the loan.  Mitt Romney's Roth IRA is over $100M.  This is one of the tools rich people use to pay less tax than their housekeepers."
2021-04-11 10:01:39,wallstreetbets,"Wash sale rules definitely DO NOT apply to IRA trades. This is because the gains and losses are not recognized until you withdrawal (preferably after age 59.5).

If you deposit 6k (which is the limit) and turn it into 600k, literally the only thing you file with the IRS is that you deposited 6k. It doesn’t matter if you make 1,000 trades or 1."

2021-04-11 11:56:01,wallstreetbets,so IRA makes day trading simpler in terms of taxes?
2021-04-11 05:00:19,wallstreetbets,"Only cash can be injected into an roth ira. It's honestly not that bad to pay taxes for the hassle. If you were to liquidate to just send money into the roth ira, you wouldn't be able to enjoy the tendies until you're in your sixties."

2021-04-11 11:42:14,wallstreetbets,"This is wrong. Any closing of an open position is a taxable event (if profit obviously). In this case selling tsla to buy gme, you pay cap gains on tsla and assuming you don’t sell gme before end of year that’s all you would pay"
2021-04-11 11:57:52,wallstreetbets,"Significantly. It’s where I do all my day trades. I only use my cash accounts for long term investments (1yr+).

The major downside with the IRA is you can’t withdraw until you’re 59.5 or else you incur massive penalty. But the tax implications more than make up for it IMO."
2021-04-11 11:57:34,wallstreetbets,I stand corrected. Posted deleted to prevent misinformation.
2021-04-11 12:21:20,wallstreetbets,so you mean it would be either a 10% withdrawal penalty or capital gains tax penalty if you withdraw before age 59 right? either way the rate is lower than paying the capital gains tax rate right?
2021-04-11 13:16:13,wallstreetbets,"It's not as straightforward as ""lower than capital gains tax"" since they both depend on your income. Withdrawing from IRA would cost 10% withdrawal penalty AND whatever amount you do withdraw counts as income so you would also incur income taxes. So if the amount you're withdrawing is small, then yes it could be significantly less than short term capital gains taxes. But if you're trying to withdraw an amount that that would move your income into at higher tax bracket, you might be paying the same/more. So there is a bit more math involved. A lot of individuals (myself included) use it to ""control"" the amount of taxes I pay on capital gains/income."

2021-04-11 01:17:19,wallstreetbets,I sold my 30Cs wayy too early and missed out on $100K+ on a meager like $200-$500.
2021-04-11 01:33:00,wallstreetbets,"Same. $600 to $26,500 https://imgur.com/a/lFv2OLJ/"
2021-04-11 01:00:02,wallstreetbets,The simplicity... this is a very epic trade. Congrats man.
2021-04-11 10:11:40,wallstreetbets,"Edit: A lot of baby apelets asking how to trade options, heres my non-financial advice:  
When you buy a call there's two things you need to consider, what date and what strike price.  The closer the date (and the higher the strike price) the riskier your option is.  If your option is riskier, the profits will be much higher if the underlying stock price raises.  So, in general what I do is buy an option for the next 1-3 weeks, and I usually buy them pretty far OTM (for example, if the stock is currently at $50, buy the call for two weeks out at $75 bucks).  
You do NOT need the stock price to actually reach $75.  If the price shoots up to. $58, your option will increase in value by quite a bit (usually, you'll get a feel for this -- if its waaay OTM, like $110 strike, a price raise from $50 to $58 won't increase your options' value by much).  At that point, you sell the option and are done with it.  
Best way to learn is just do it, make predictions (aka gamble) if you think a stock will go up or down , and then buy either a call(up) or a put(down) for a few weeks out with a strike price that is moderately OTM (out of the money).

Second edit: the hardest part about options is knowing when to sell and take profits/cut loss.  Generally, I allow a lot of options to expire worthless rather than sell at a loss because I have a diamond mindset.  If you're gonna get scared when your options drop halfway and panic sell, don't do options, or at least -- spend less on options so you're less likely to paper hands them if things head south."
2021-04-11 09:52:37,wallstreetbets,Made the same trade but sold most of the calls after the initial 800-1000% run up because I figured profit is profit. Almost cried when I saw that holding all the calls I’d sold would’ve made me a couple million later that week.

2021-04-11 08:44:25,wallstreetbets,"An option, or more specifically a call option, is a magic ticket that allows you to buy stock at a certain price. This is good because when stocks go up you profit. If it goes down and is lower than your strike price(price of the stock when you bought the ticket) you lose what you paid for the magic ticket. OP paid $400 for their magic ticket and sold their magic ticket for $23k to someone that wanted the buying power of that very valuable ticket.

This is all very simplified but you should get the point"
2021-04-11 11:48:03,wallstreetbets,I didn’t understand until I said fuck it and bought some. Start small. Like one contract under 10 bucks.

Beware though. Options is a tool invented by the rich to make money off of the poor. Options allow the rich (market maker) to hedge (think of them as a bookmaker). Since it’s a bet, technically speaking, you have a 50/50 chance of winning. So some will lose and some will win. But everyone who places a bet will have to pay a fee (premium). So the market maker make money off of those premiums, all they have to do is making the same bet every time someone places a bet."

Each coupon cost 4.60 but you can only by them by the book so he spent $460 on it. On the 27, the price of GME skyrocketed so each of the coupons became worth $240. He resold the book to someone else to capitalize on the price increase, netting him $24k."

2021-04-11 11:17:22,wallstreetbets,The short squeeze wasn’t so obvious back then. GameStop actually dropped after earnings and we all were afraid it wouldn’t happen. I got in at $16 and probably sold the calls in the $70 range.
2021-04-11 11:44:43,wallstreetbets,I market sold. The squeeze to $500 wasn’t so obvious at the very beginning. So when it ran to $50-$70 I sold.

Hell I bought a MSFT LEAP like two weeks ago that is up 40% and I have to remind myself every day not to sell it. I can't even imagine the diamond huevos you'd need to hold something short term through something like GME a few months ago."
2021-04-11 14:45:01,wallstreetbets,Lmao true that
2021-04-11 18:42:50,wallstreetbets,Sure. Something doesn't smell right with me on that.
2021-04-11 14:26:54,wallstreetbets,Thank you that makes so much sense. I thought I understood the risks involved with options and getting assigned was always one of my bigger fears keeping me from trying it out.
2021-04-11 11:21:50,wallstreetbets,"OTM means out of the money.

That means the call has a strike price that is above what the price currently is -- meaning when you buy this call option, you're betting the price will raise."
2021-04-11 18:33:21,wallstreetbets,"No, I was too shocked when I saw the price I could sell the option for so I just  sold lol.  Later I thought about what I wanna do and decided to buy shares."

2021-04-11 10:20:13,wallstreetbets,how did he do that with 400$? margin ?
2021-04-11 04:08:56,wallstreetbets,This is wrong.
2021-04-11 03:27:00,wallstreetbets,Uh that doesn’t sound right.. he spent $460.. he bought them for $4.60 each. $60 is the call.
2021-04-11 11:01:37,wallstreetbets,"How can you say your case is different? Your the exact definition of what the previous person said. 

You posted this as $400 to 23k with one option. You make it seem to a casual observer that this is easy and with one bet you made a ton. Then you back track and say you have had losses of 60k and 100k. Occasionally things pan out and people save their portfolios. This is exactly what the previous prayer was trying to make clear.

My issue with not disclosing things like this is you have first time investors on here thinking ""look how easy this is, I could do this with the $500 or $1000 I have sitting alive and get rich"". Then they lose it and leave investing for a long time. I called it out awhile ago where someone was bragging about their portfolios diversity been 100% GME with like 200-300k invested. I asked some pointed questions and of course the truth comes out. They were a multimillionaire with several different investment accounts and had opened a new account to play with GME. The way they posted made it seem like this was their only account and had yolod everything - not that they were playing with their spare pocket change in one of several accounts - the majority managed by actual money managers."
2021-04-11 11:13:37,wallstreetbets,I'm confused. It's not a 'loss' if you didn't sell. Sounds like you didn't sell?
2021-04-11 16:07:16,wallstreetbets,300 K liquid?   Or 300K in unrealized gains?
2021-04-11 13:48:12,wallstreetbets,"Most people don’t understand, but the real risk of option is it positive feedback loop of cutting losses. The first few days, you lose 100 to 500, and it takes a toll on you. But after that you had complicit and you have massive losses of more than thousands doing random trade so you think it’s going to do good. 

Because with just shares, A loss 20% is unexpected most times, but with options loss of 100% is statistically the most expected value."
2021-04-11 18:53:53,wallstreetbets,I gotta admit I'm shocked how many people here don't know what options are.  I thought every single retard here played options.

2021-04-11 17:09:34,wallstreetbets,The option contract give you the right to sell/buy exactly 100 shares at a certain price but the brokers give you a price on a per share basis. So every time you see a contract price you have to multiply by 100 to get its actual sell/buy price.

This is how I learned how to trade with options. He goes just in-depth enough to not let you get confused. Through the series, he goes over option contracts extrinsic/intrinsic value, greeks, and common option strategies. He's a redditor himself, so he cracks some good jokes to keep things light-hearted and not too technical all the time."
2021-04-11 14:30:06,wallstreetbets,"Getting assigned is not necessarily a bad thing in a contract. Sometimes you'd really like to be assigned! Look up ""cash covered puts"". Then there are also ""covered calls"".

If you mix cash covered puts with covered calls, congratulations, you now have the wheel strategy where you're collecting premiums all the time on a stock you like.

Getting assigned is not a bad thing if it's part of what you want."

2021-04-11 10:27:32,wallstreetbets,"No, this guy's explanation is off, I only spent $460.  That's how much the call option cost when I bought it, and then the call option became worth 23k the next week and I sold it ."
2021-04-11 05:49:29,wallstreetbets,No
2021-04-11 03:42:50,wallstreetbets,He simplified it for ape gang. He purchased the right to buy shares at $60 a share for $4.60 a share bringing his cost per share to $64.60 if he exercised. He sold his right to buy at $64.60 cost basis at around 230 per share. Options are leveraged. They allow you to control more assets with smaller amounts of capital.
2021-04-11 04:53:46,wallstreetbets,I’m probably going to wank on your back.
2021-04-11 11:11:40,wallstreetbets,"But I did disclose it right here, and other places in this thread.  Also if you're dumb enough to think it's a sure thing to make money on options then you really do belong here.  But truth is, yes, someone really could take 1k or 5k and do this.

I started with 8k - my life savings, and yolod all of it into options and made 40k, and kept going from there, it can happen.  

I think it's fine to warn people shit is risky. But these are grown retards playing in a grownup game -- there is risk. If they wanna take it so be it, maybe they'll get lucky.

This sub has always had gain porn, you think it should be done away with?  Or have some boilerplate warning that investing is risky?"
2021-04-11 11:25:54,wallstreetbets,"That's correct, the 100k ""loss"" on gme shares wasn't a loss really cause I held them.

The 60k options loss was a loss because my options that were worth 60k expired worthless.  BUT I only spent like 2k on them, they ballooned to like 60k, then expired worthless.  So I guess you could think of it as I lost 2k (my initial investment) but thats only to help one sleep at night lol."

2021-04-11 12:09:49,wallstreetbets,The dudes first ever post in WSB was asking what options were back in late January and he’s asking other people if they’re new here lmao
2021-04-11 18:41:52,wallstreetbets,"Thank you so much! This is really helpful. I don’t have a ton of money to my name so I guess that’s why I’m wary of being assigned now. I’ve got a job to keep bills paid and with a little left over to gamble and hopefully grow and from what I’ve seen over the years here lurking options are some of the best ways to realize large gains shortly. If I was wealthier I’d probably not worry about it. Again thank you I’ll give this a look.

Edit: so after watching it my only question is how did the one example lose more money then they actually had? I thought when you buy a contract the most you could lose was the premium?"

This guy bought an option when the price to buy it was at 4.60 a share. Because options are always 100 shares, then you have to multiply the price to buy that one share by 100.        

So he spent 460 just to buy the option/contract, that's money spent upfront. He's never getting that back unless the gains he makes are above that number.        

Now, because an option is a contract to buy in the future, then you gotta set a price to buy at, he asked $60.          
So now, to make money, he has to exercise that option at any point before the set date.          
This allows him to immediately buy 100 shares at the agreed price of $60 no matter what price the stock is at that time, so he would have to spend that $60 per share for 100 shares ($6000).           
   
You want to do this when the share price is above your strike price (say $100) so you can buy at $60 sell at $100 and make some money.         

Now if you don't have the $6000 to buy those shares when you need to, you can simply sell the contract itself for more than you paid for it because someone else thinks they can make a lot of money from exercising it and buying then selling the shares.         
So he bought it at $4.60 per share ($460 total) and sold it at $239.85 per share ($23,985).        

This is not exactly usual, it was the extreme shorting which made the option price cheap, and the extreme volatility which made it more expensive.         

I wouldn't mess with options, just know that at least if you buy calls you can only lose what you bought it for. You aren't forced to exercise it and buy the shares, but someone might also not buy it from you."
2021-04-11 10:49:23,wallstreetbets,"Not being a dick when I say this, but you should do some research on your own here. Just google how options work. The concept is really quite simple. And you researching for yourself will be much more effective and beneficial than having some retard here simplify an explanation for you."
2021-04-11 10:42:18,wallstreetbets,"I have a longer comment somewhere else on this post explaining how to trade options.

As for why? If the price if the stock goes up, the price for the option goes up even higher, and here the stock price went way up (lucky) and so the option price went way way up."
2021-04-11 11:18:39,wallstreetbets,"The $4.60 thing is just the way options prices are displayed.  One option is a contract for 100 shares, so, that's 4.60 a share since the option price was $460.  Basically that $4.60 thing is not important and you can ignore it tbh."
2021-04-11 14:11:58,wallstreetbets,"Options are leveraged derivatives. So you can buy a contract for the right to sell a hundred shares, without having to pay upfront for those 100 shares. I know I’m simplifying here guys but getting the basics to click first will help them with further understanding. But also he’s right, watch some YouTube videos, and go to investopedia. I recommend InTheMoney on YT he has a whole intro to options trading video."
2021-04-11 16:38:21,wallstreetbets,Oh sorry haha i misread the comment that you objected to! He bought THE RIGHT to buy 100 shares at $60 each for $460. Mb bro
2021-04-11 06:52:59,wallstreetbets,"If you buy an option and the price *doesn't* go up, you forfeit the premium you paid.

In this example, had GME not gone up but instead stayed at $60 a share, OP would have lost his $460 premium, as it expired out of the money (OTM)"
2021-04-11 09:04:17,wallstreetbets,"The problem is predicting which way a stock price will go by a certain date. Stock prices are volatile, and some stocks are extremely volatile, so knowing what price to to choose, and what date you think the stock will reach that price is the incredibly difficult part of options trading. For example, if you buy an option to purchase GME on April 16 for $250 per share, and GME doesn’t reach $250 until May 1, your options expire worthless and you lose whatever you paid for the option. I’m way over simplifying it, but this is the gist of a Call option. To further complicate it, suppose GME makes a brief run to $255 on April 14, and you could sell your option that is now In The Money for a tidy profit on April 14, but you think it is going to go higher, so you wait...then the price drops back to $175, and your “on paper” profits evaporate. Just as with any other stock trade, buying is easy, but knowing when to sell and take profits is the really hard part. Don’t be seduced by posts that make this look easy. It isn’t. Buying shares is a much safer way to invest in a company, but safety always comes at the cost of less potential upside. Go to Amazon and get a book like this one:  (there are lots of them to choose from)

Also, look at YouTube videos on options trading. There are lots of really good ones"
2021-04-11 13:57:24,wallstreetbets,"If you buy a $1200 contract (call) for GME, betting that it will hit and surpass $160 (strike price) sometime next week, but instead it stays sideways at $155 until the expiration date- you lose all $1200. However, for every dollar is goes above $160, if that happened, you gain $100 (100 shares in a contract). So if it goes to $170, and you sell the contract, you’d make $1,000. (10x100). So essentially, you are paying $1200 for the chance to make money. But if your bet doesn’t pan out you lose it all. It’s gambling. UNLESS you know what you are doing and are experienced. I just started with options a month or so ago, every contract I buy is money I am totally willing to lose, and I don’t buy contracts over $150. And I buy them very very rarely. If you really wanna get into it I say go for it- but be prepared to lose some bets."

I have a last question. Why is it so much risk if he is only risking 460$? I understand that this is an extreme example, but if it went up lets say 10% he would still have won some money or not?

I would never do these things. Just want to understand what you guys say"
2021-04-11 07:12:24,wallstreetbets,I see. Thanks for the explanation.
2021-04-11 08:29:45,wallstreetbets,So does it have to hit $60 exactly or above to cash out with a profit? What if it gets to 59 but never goes over 60?

2021-04-11 11:28:37,wallstreetbets,"To add to this, the call doesn't need to be ITM (in the money) for you to profit-- In fact, I've rarely profited from options that actually went ITM cause I sell before that.

2021-04-11 12:54:10,wallstreetbets,"You're lucky this place is a kindergarten now. You would've been banned in December for such laziness and spam. 

Want me to teach you how to google? It's  not hard, I promise BB. 

Step 1: www.google.com
Step 2: Type ""Trading Options basics"" into the search bar. 
Step 3: STFU and study."
2021-04-11 15:15:44,wallstreetbets,"It’s risky because of the price of the stock drops below the strike price, then the option would expire worthless. Meaning they would get no money."
2021-04-11 16:29:20,wallstreetbets,"The risk is that if the stock is currently at $5, and you buy $60 calls, then there is a very good chance that you are going to lose all your money (when the option expires worthless).

You can sell the contact to someone else before it expires - it has time value (""theta""), so if it's only up 10% you can choose to sell it and get some of your money back."
2021-04-11 17:31:22,wallstreetbets,"Btw, I'm also new at this, I'm just trying to honestly get into stocks and shares properly after this.        
If the squeeze isn't as we hoped to due fuckery, I want to use my gains to continue trading and hopefully at least do something like earn minimum wage for awhile until I get good.              

Anyway, at that level of price, there isn't much risk. It's just that as it gets more expensive it gets harder to recoup your cost back.         
You have to factor how much you paid for the option into the share price above your strike. So this guy would technically see gains at anything above $61, but he would need to see profits of at least 460 dollars before he truly broke even.         

The changes in the option price ( the differences in the price you pay per share) is called Delta. It adds or subtracts that the options price (its 'premium') by a certain amount everytime that stock goes up or down by $1.         
It can only be between 1 and -1.             
 
So, if Delta is at 0.50 then the option's premium will go up by $.50 everytime the stock goes up by $1 and vice versa.        
   
But then why or how does the Delta decide that?         
That's called Gamma. The Gamma change the number of the Delta based on calculations including stuff like Implied Volatility.        

So now you know that, the reason options can be very tricky is that the longer you hold an option then the more time it has to go either closer or further away from your strike price.        
This makes it riskier because the more time passes the closer you get to your option's expiry date when you have to shit or get off the pot.        

This increase in risk is a time-decay of price and is called Theta, it lowers the inherent price of your option over time (not a problem if you plan to exercise it and buy the shares).         

So, if you never spend more than you can lose it isn't risky.         
But you can potentially never sell the option, or the share price doesn't go above your strike price if you plan to buy, or you hold onto it too long waiting for a price change and it loses value due to Theta.        
And by selling the option you never net as large a profit as just exercising it and buying the shares, but then you have to see the future and bet on the market price rising past your strike."
2021-04-11 08:43:04,wallstreetbets,"OP set the ""strike price"" as $60. This means he is betting GME would hit or surpass $60 a share before the call option expired. If it had only hit $59, he would not be able to exercise the option, because it did not rise pass the strike price of $60. If OP exercised the option at exactly the strike price, in this case $60, he would still *technically* be losing money, because he would be buying a $60 share for $60, meaning he paid the initial premium (in this case $460) to buy shares at market value.

The way you make money with calls options is exercising when the price has risen well *above* your set strike price. In our example here, OP's call option gave him the right to purchase 100 shares each worth $239, for $60 each. Now, since that means OP would have to fork over $6,000, most people will instead sell the contract and pocket the profits that way."
2021-04-11 08:43:24,wallstreetbets,"Option pricing is somewhat complicated and multifaceted. You can make money even on options if the price never hits the strike. For example if you bought a call for a few months out 10% out of the money and the stock moved closer to the strike but didn’t hit it within a few days of buying the option, the option would be worth more and you could sell for profit. Most people do not hold options to expiration or even that close to expiration. Options have both extrinsic and intrinsic value which effects pricing. Look it up if you want to learn more, it’s too much to explain in comments."
2021-04-11 08:36:44,wallstreetbets,"No, buying an option gives you the *right* to buy those 100 shares, it doesn't *have* to. In this scenario, had GME tanked to $1 a share, OP would not be forced to buy them at a massive loss. He'd just lose his premium.

With Call options, basically if the share price doesn't hit your ""strike price"" (which is the price you bet it will rise to before the date you set when you buy the option), all that happens is you give up the premium you paid initially. Options give you the right, not the obligation, to buy shares."
2021-04-11 14:00:36,wallstreetbets,You only lose what you put in with options. Which I know sounds like a great upside. It really is low cost/high reward. But it can get expensive fast when three contracts expire out of the money and you lose $2000 in a day. Then a lot of folks get emotional and try to make back they’re losses which leads to more losses. You have to be disciplined.

2021-04-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BABA - Alibaba: The Undervalued Tech Behemoth **Fellow Apes,**

Alibaba has been getting rocked lately due to regulation crackdowns on tech firms within China. Furthermore, Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, criticized the Chinese government near the end of 2020, and must have forgotten he lived in a Communist country because President Xi did not waste any time putting him in his place and causing the stock to lose ground.

**Fundamentals:**  
\- Fiscal Year 2021 Q3 Revenue came in at $33.8B which was a 37% increase year-over-year  
\- Adjusted EBITDA up 22% year-over-year  
\- Income from operations came in at $7.5B which was a 24% increase year-over-year  
\- Non-GAAP Net Income came in at $9B which was a 27% increase year-over-year  
\- Non-GAAP Diluted EPS came is at $3.38 which was a 21% increase year-over-year  
\-  Annual active consumers on China retail marketplaces reached 779 million for the twelve months period ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 22 million from the twelve months period ended September 30, 2020.

**Source:** [**https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press\_pdf/p210202.pdf**](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p210202.pdf)

**E-Commerce:** Alibaba has growing competition from companies such as JD and Pinduoduo in the e-commerce space, but still holds a dominate position with 56% of the current market share, and can continue that momentum given that China expects retail sales to make up 52% of e-commerce sales in 2021, which is up from 44.8% a year prior, and also expects the trend to tick upward through 2024. The most recent earnings release showed a 38% increase in revenue from their core e-commerce space.

**Cloud Computing Services:**  
\- Revenue for the company's cloud computing business grew 50% year over year to $2.47 billion.  
\- Alibaba Cloud achieved positive adjusted EBITA during the quarter   
\- With Alibaba's cloud computing business beginning to take off, there is still plenty of room to add to its overall source of revenue considering that it currently makes up just 7% of their revenue.  
\- Furthermore, the US cloud market is currently about 8 times larger than China's, giving them much more room for growth and more opportunity for Alibaba to capitalize.

**Company outlook and why I am bullish on the stock:**  
\- Alibaba stock is currently down roughly 30% from is all time high  
\- BABA is expected to grow revenues by 39% this year  
\- BABA is expected to grow revenues by 31% in 2022  
\- BABA is expected to achieve EPS of $10.14 in Fiscal 2021  
\- BABA is expected to achieve EPS of $11.61 in Fiscal 2022  
\*\*\* with the stock currently sitting at $223.31, it is trading just 22 times fiscal 2021 EPS and 19 times fiscal 2022 EPS, and with the expected revenue growth, this seems like a cheap stock at the moment. Also, with an EPS last year of $8.08 and an estimate this year of $10.14, that shows an expectation of 25% YOY EPS growth, again, making the stock look cheap.

**Risks and potential reasons not to buy the stock:**  
\- BABA was just fined $2.8B for anti-trust bullshit  
\- crackdowns from Chinese gov't can hinder their growth potential and market share dominance  
\- Bill Gates investment team dropped their position in BABA  
\- There have been talks that they may be forced to divest some of their non-core business segments

**TL;DR:**  
BABA has been under a lot of pressure lately due to regulations and crackdowns on tech firms by the Chinese gov't causing the stock to currently trade 30% off its all time high. They just had to pay a $2.8B fine. Aside from this, the company is expected to grow revenues by 39% this year and 31% next year. It is currently trading 22 times Fiscal 2021 EPS and 19 times Fiscal 2022 EPS which makes the stock attractive given the company's expected revenue growth. With how cheap the stock is, and how well the company is expected to grow, the stock can be viewed as both a value and growth stock. With the $2.8B fine out of the way, I believe the selling of BABA is nearing an end, and now set to moon. My boy Charlie Munger agrees with me (he just bought BABA to make for 19% of his equity portfolio).

Personally overall, I am quite happy with just the sub $3B fine. Yes it is a lot, and although this may have other implications, I feel for the most part that this is the only concrete bad for BABA.

With all of its business segments experiencing such momentous growth still and dropping the bad press, BABA has a bright future ahead of it.

Particularly excited for their cloud play.

Regardless, a further drop on BABA or JD and I am doubling down happily"

2021-04-11 13:25:31,wallstreetbets,Bought more jan $300 calls this week at $7.40 its basically highway robbery if the company futures turn green in a few months. I remember buying at around 17.00 and selling at 20.00 only for them to sky high at 32.00. Time will tell if I break even or go broke.
2021-04-11 16:32:10,wallstreetbets,$6k in commons at $224 and holding

2021-04-11 07:49:21,wallstreetbets,"No more Chinese companies for me. I learned my lesson from Luckin.... fuck the CCP, with all undue respect. Sure looks good on paper though!"
2021-04-11 02:11:06,wallstreetbets,"I saw Jack Ma talking to Ilon Musk. He was close to being laughing stock with his statements. 

In addition Jack Ma has bigger problems with Chineae government his 29B Ipo of Ant cloud services was cancelled three days before it was scheduled by Chinese government. Now the 2.78B fine. Plus the changes that AliBaba would be required to make with its financing. 

Way too risky."
2021-04-11 01:10:52,wallstreetbets,"Every Chinese stock in my portfolio has tanked. I sold baba on Friday. Eqos is down 43% since I bought that turd. There’s no telling what’s happening in China, but it’s not looking good y’all"
2021-04-11 03:01:52,wallstreetbets,Baba stock will tank Monday open
2021-04-11 01:43:28,wallstreetbets,"Alibaba is a stupid name, I'm out"
2021-04-11 02:09:00,wallstreetbets,"No thanks. Most retards here don’t understand that when they invest in companies like alibaba or tencent, they are not really investing in the actual company but a vie(variable interest entity) based in cayman island or some offshore haven...you as a investor have no claim to company or it assets,you only have claim to its revenue..if ccp wanted they could just declare this entities illegal and foreign investors would be left with nothing..good luck litigating in china..fuck ccp and fuck chinese companies...i am staying away from it. ..https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-2748861/Alibabas-VIE-structure.html"
2021-04-11 00:57:26,wallstreetbets,Do not trust Chinese companies that are trading on our US exchanges they are more fraudulent then the hedges.  They can legally make up earnings on SEC filings. Watch the China Hustle and you will understand.
2021-04-11 11:19:25,wallstreetbets,Boomer stonk.
2021-04-11 00:54:49,wallstreetbets,I have no remorse for a company that produces off hand junk and infringes on other people’s Intellectual property. Ask Donald Trump if he’s still interested
2021-04-11 01:41:46,wallstreetbets,"Everything you wrote seems to indicate the stock is overvalued, not under.
Ape no like stock."
2021-04-11 08:59:58,wallstreetbets,I'm wary of further actions from china against baba as well but I wouldn't be surprised if Jack Ma let's go of control. Didn't he reduce his stake anyways a year or so back. He can easily step aside as a part of some sort of agreement and let BABA survive with him living a retired life serving people ala bill gates
2021-04-11 11:01:05,wallstreetbets,How come I’m down so much then?
2021-04-11 12:16:49,wallstreetbets,"I think the title of the post answers the question why. 

CHINA"
2021-04-11 12:32:36,wallstreetbets,Didn't jack ma disappear? Is he back? Was he on vacation?
2021-04-11 13:11:54,wallstreetbets,I'd put money if it wasn't red.
2021-04-11 14:09:59,wallstreetbets,I heard that they're getting delisted from NYSE/NASDAQ?

2021-04-11 05:04:55,wallstreetbets,"Weird how when BABA got fined on Saturday lots of DD on BABA pops up in every investment sub. Sure, I think BABA is a smart long play, but seriously, this is going to be a bad entry point if you buy at market open imho."
2021-04-11 05:39:25,wallstreetbets,alibaba? more like alibyebye
2021-04-11 06:39:17,wallstreetbets,"It's 4percent of revenue. It's a respectable fine that doesn't threaten the company too much. More than a slap on the wrist, more say a solid punch in the gut, but no internal bleeding"
2021-04-11 08:56:48,wallstreetbets,"The fine was chump change for a company with 70b in cash. With the investigation all but over, the stock should starting ripping"
2021-04-11 00:56:19,wallstreetbets,If you don’t mind answering what calls do you have a position in?
2021-04-11 01:31:35,wallstreetbets,"If your happy losing money, why don't you just give it to us."
2021-04-11 14:26:06,wallstreetbets,"I agree, I think it can take some more time as well. I don’t necessarily see this being a quick  turnaround, but definitely seeing potential"
2021-04-11 19:11:31,wallstreetbets,Patience pays off. I was saying the same about TSM/AMAT/ASML for years now and finally they rocket.
2021-04-11 07:39:45,wallstreetbets,I kinda need to know that the head guy has not been sent to re-educate himself.
2021-04-11 09:03:11,wallstreetbets,It might be undervalued for a very long time. China keep reducing liquidity.
2021-04-11 08:28:54,wallstreetbets,So do all my Asian colleagues. Literally showed me 7 apps they use weekly...all tied to BABA.
2021-04-11 15:16:08,wallstreetbets,I live in Thailand and buy everything on Lazada which is owned by BABA.
2021-04-11 01:52:59,wallstreetbets,Haha my bad.
2021-04-11 10:26:45,wallstreetbets,World's oldest man likes BABA. How's that?
2021-04-11 06:22:20,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀💵💵💵
2021-04-11 03:51:35,wallstreetbets,"Same thought. I‘ve seen tons of people say this, and I‘m inclined to believe it. The chinese government doesn’t seem too happy with them at the moment, so what tells us they’re not gonna hurt them more in the future?

Granted I have no idea how this works."
2021-04-11 04:15:34,wallstreetbets,The numbers could all just be cooked
2021-04-11 08:58:05,wallstreetbets,"So funny to hear people talk about risk on WSB. If you don’t like BABA, maybe buy a failing video game retail store that wants to move online."
2021-04-11 12:03:34,wallstreetbets,China has won my trust after they released their actual inflation data un like the USA here cooking the books and shit thinking it’s people are as stupid as they were back then. Well maybe yes but no lol
2021-04-11 15:33:09,wallstreetbets,Like there are no shady US companies?
2021-04-11 11:01:57,wallstreetbets,Be greedy when pussys are scared. Im buying off this comment
2021-04-11 16:51:52,wallstreetbets,Wall Street bets users will say this and then go invest in GME/Tesla calls lmaoo
2021-04-11 14:28:04,wallstreetbets,"It should, there were worries that the punishment would be much larger and include things along the lines of divesting and breaking up business activities. Just a fine at this point could be good news for baba"
2021-04-11 14:56:31,wallstreetbets,Nice! Way to take advantage of some call positions. I’m long the stock and plan to add more this week. Buffet says to look for opportunities when everyone else sees blood in the streets and I feel like this is an example of that over these past 4 months as you mentioned
2021-04-11 02:53:44,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, and yeah we’ll see how jack ma plays out. For munger to invest it makes me think that those types of issues are ending... hopefully"
2021-04-11 15:19:12,wallstreetbets,This is pretty much my position. I don't mind holding some overvalued stocks I bought a while ago to ride profit like AAPL/GOOG/AMZN but they are the first positions I'm selling if things look bad. I'm going to hold stuff like INTC/BABA/etc that are still somewhat undervalued as they don't have as far to fall it valuations get pulled back towards the mean.
2021-04-11 14:47:05,wallstreetbets,"Great points, and the recent fine proves what your saying. They’ve definitely put themselves under the scope.

But I feel that all of their competitors are now under the exact same scope which will keep the competition consistent. Babas competitors have most likely been involved in the same unethical practices, but due to them not been around as long or being as large as baba, they aren’t the ones dealing with the fine or sec requirements. But the fine sends a message to the entire industry that will force them to adjust the same way baba has to"
2021-04-11 19:23:09,wallstreetbets,"They paid 2.8 billion to use the cheat code for a while, now they have market dominance.."

2021-04-10 23:54:09,wallstreetbets,watch what china does over these next 10 years
2021-04-11 08:24:10,wallstreetbets,He so smart. All major investment firms in Chinese companies so dum.
2021-04-11 01:14:57,wallstreetbets,"I don’t trust American companies either, but it’s a gulf apart.  If I have to look at investing in a country with poor transparency compounded by obligatory filial submission to the whims of ego conflicts  and owed favors at the highest level of unilateralism I bow out."
2021-04-11 01:41:46,wallstreetbets,"You don't own shares like american companies, their scheme just reeks of a superiority mindset over everyone else in the world.

They too have a manifest destiny/center of the world type of ethos some people would argue that it's far far older than manifest destiny(hell the US itself).

Options only.

Buy and hold shares. Fuck no."
2021-04-11 13:55:27,wallstreetbets,"Just remember that the US government is basically not allowing Facebook or Google to make any acquisitions, and they scrutinize them over the littlest things"
2021-04-11 15:20:54,wallstreetbets,Yeah 2020 was looking real nice until the Jack Ma fiasco. Sounds like you’ve been pretty patient with this stock. Definitely thinking it’s about to pay off for you
2021-04-11 12:36:24,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think there is going to be a sell off. This was priced in and then some. People were expecting much worse (fine as much as 10B, forced break-up, etc.). 

The end of the probe will likely be a catalyst, and I see some healthy price movement upward on this news. 

But maybe I’m just biased."
2021-04-10 23:51:09,wallstreetbets,"I believe the stock has been sold because investors knew they were going to face some type of punishment from the gov't. In other words, the $2B fine may have already been priced in. There can definitely be some more selling this week, but it only makes sense for this stock to turn around and moon."
2021-04-11 07:25:17,wallstreetbets,Isn’t their net profit like $20B a year though? 😂
2021-04-11 10:34:50,wallstreetbets,You shouldn't even be 5% confident
2021-04-11 15:10:47,wallstreetbets,Nice thanks for sharing on the AI piece. Their cloud segment potential is what really stands out to me.
2021-04-11 15:16:50,wallstreetbets,"Good point, I’m usually hesitant on China companies as well. But I don’t want to completely eliminate them from my portfolio because there are some incredible opportunities in China, and I want to keep my options open. When I see someone like munger invest in a Chinese company it gives me reassurance that this is one of the Chinese companies that has a legitimate plan to comply with government and sec requirements to further themselves rather than hurt themselves"
2021-04-11 03:21:12,wallstreetbets,"I don’t see jack ma being an issue. This is a bit of a stretch, but I don’t think munger would invest in a company that could be ruined by a single person"
2021-04-11 08:26:09,wallstreetbets,Except he is not the CEO.
2021-04-11 02:21:40,wallstreetbets,Who IS in the club then?
2021-04-11 10:36:38,wallstreetbets,"Everything in China is like that. Garbage that has been made really shiny.

China is a Caveat Emptor country. If you arent paranoid you will go home broke."
2021-04-11 02:24:37,wallstreetbets,"Jack Ma is out of the picture. The stock is not moving based on jack ma at this point. Ant IPO got delayed but it’s still a fantastic opportunity for baba and still has plans to ipo. If anything, Ant is another catalyst for the stock"
2021-04-11 01:19:31,wallstreetbets,"Why sell low at a time like this? If Charlie munger is buying I’m asking myself what he knows that I don’t before letting that one go. China is complex but they aren’t trying to shoot themselves in the foot, if you really take a look, they are on track to surpass the US shortly"
2021-04-11 08:26:57,wallstreetbets,Buy when others are fearful. Time to load up on more.
2021-04-11 03:03:41,wallstreetbets,It would just be another buying opportunity in my opinion
2021-04-11 08:26:35,wallstreetbets,Or gain on the final news of a fine. It’s been the uncertainty holding it down.
2021-04-11 01:45:53,wallstreetbets,That’s how I felt about Xpeng. Who is going to drive a car called Xpeng?
2021-04-11 02:07:53,wallstreetbets,Don't you know the story of Alibaba and the 40 thieves.  Get it now.
2021-04-11 05:32:50,wallstreetbets,"They would be shooting themselves directly in the foot. Without foreign buyers, they would be slashing the value of their entire market. We may be left holding leaking bags, but they would cripple a large chunk of their economic system"
2021-04-11 02:22:23,wallstreetbets,"Good point, the risk is definitely higher with international companies especially China. But I don’t see myself ever in a position where I’m trying to claim company assets or litigate in China. I see the chances of something like this being low with baba"
2021-04-11 01:25:38,wallstreetbets,"Us companies do the same thing. And Alibaba isn’t just any Chinese company. They are a behemoth that is basically involved in almost every Chinese household, I don’t think that compares to other Chinese stocks listed on us exchanges 

I’ll check out China hustle tho haha"
2021-04-11 01:28:43,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha, you don’t need to have remorse you just need some cash to buy this dip"
2021-04-11 01:51:10,wallstreetbets,"At first glance yes, but you have to take into consideration this is a growth company growing revenues at an estimated 30-39% over the next 2 years."
2021-04-11 14:52:46,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion it’s because of everything that’s currently unfolding. Investors saw this coming and now I’m expecting a turn around. I still definitely think it’s possible the stock gets whacked this week, but overall I expect to moon"
2021-04-11 15:17:55,wallstreetbets,"I’ve heard he was laying low, or house arrest, or  kidnapped.... I’m thinking he was laying low haha"
2021-04-11 15:24:31,wallstreetbets,Sec was saying they would delist Chinese companies that aren’t willing to comply. Mungers decision to buy the stock makes me think that baba is dedicated to following the rules going forward

We somewhat get signs from GameStop that it will drop or rise soon. With Chinese companies, it could be worth a lot one moment and only be worth 1/3rd of that value the next moment without any reason to trigger the drop in value other than the Chinese government interfering."

They say that they won’t invest bc Jack Ma criticized the CCP and they will also say they won’t invest bc they hate the CCP. Honestly it sounds like excuses for good old fashioned casual anti-Asian racism from typical ignorant americans. Ignore the haters. If you look at things objectively, I’m not an experienced trader but the experienced traders on reddit have said the same as you but with less numbers to back it up. They just aren’t all in this thread.

when my dad liked ali baba back when i was into bidu i wrote it off saying i didn’t understand china or their business enough. I have said the same this whole time. Only after looking at your numbers do I realize what a fool I have been to not at least been watching for a good entry point"

Baba unfortunately is getting picked apart by the social party because they don’t like Jack Ma. I see this company getting spinners off into other companies. Or over taken by another head that has little to no ownership of the company before a turnaround."
2021-04-11 08:25:33,wallstreetbets,I agree. Putting an end to the uncertainty will finally allow money to pile back in. Absolutely undervalued.
2021-04-11 10:28:33,wallstreetbets,"They also got hit with instructions on how to run their business. They no longer can operate as a “ monopoly”.

Similar to a fine and fix it ticket, if they don’t fix it you can expect another fine.

When we are talking investments, if your company lost 10% net profit and was told to reorganize.. that would hurt the stock and it’s projections."
2021-04-11 16:17:10,wallstreetbets,"I mean they invest cause of greed, not because of any risk free related issue.

There is a documentary on Netflix that's called the china hustle that talks about the latest rounds of roth capital pushing Chinese stock after 2008 like they were made of solid gold, when in reality a lot of them were made of paper.

Thats march 24, this means that the process to have US audit some of these companies, has just started.

>In a statement published by the agency on Wednesday, the SEC said non-compliance for three consecutive years will get companies kicked off from the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.

> Among the notable listed firms not complying with the audit inspection are Jack Ma's Alibaba Group and internet giant Baidu.

Yeah thats a no for me, I like the casino but this is like gabling in a dark alley with 5 shady looking guys I just met that told me they were going to help me got some easy money If I just bring some cash and come alone."
2021-04-11 03:09:51,wallstreetbets,Baidu is currently collaborating with Geely on EV. Geely is Xi’s toy.

2021-04-11 15:26:35,wallstreetbets,"There more to it than that.

In February some very big things happened. First was China signaled they were going to tighten monetary policy, i.e less credit, less liquidity. They also voiced concerns about asset bubbles forming.

Simultaneously or perhaps linked a massive $40B position in US treasuries was unwound almost overnight. My guess is this was a huge hedge against the stock market downturn that was put on at the start of the covid crash and was now being liquidated for a profit before anyone else could start selling bonds.

Unfortunately due to the speed that position was unwound it blew up a ton of bond longs that were overleveraged (stupidly high leverage is common in bond market, similar to futures etc) this caused more forced selling. This basically spread into a global bond rout decimating credit, pushing up the spread and driving a massive repricing of the bond market back towards pre-covid levels.

The latter is what caused the massive sell off in risk and growth assets in the US market starting Feb 18th. The former made the same trade even more aggressive in the Chinese markets with all tech stocks getting sold off and heavily shorted down.

It was so bad that start of March the Chinese state funds started buying stocks to try stop the rout.

This is only just bottoming now and is the real reason why Chinese stocks are due to go back up."

2021-04-11 15:09:00,wallstreetbets,"Not sure where to start, but to simplify it to the most basic principle, China is not a place where companies feel obligated to make investors whole, especially foreign investors.

And while the country may portray an illusion of stability, the rules change overnight.

As an example, China could decide tomorrow that the Alibaba entity in Cayman Islands is illegitimate since foreign investing is already banned, and that the stock they own belongs to the state.

China has no problem doing things like this, the overwhelming theme in China is that they do everything they do for the betterment of the Chinese People. They don't jump through hoops there to do things like that, they just do it.

Making foreigners whole is not anywhere on the list of things China cares about."

The journalistic standards of the US media when it comes to reporting on China are especially low. Most American China ""analysts"" don't know the language, and when the guy writing the article also doesn't know the language, it can really be a recipe for disaster. There are many threads on twitter with embarassing shit from such ""journalists""

One piece I saw in the NYT looked like it wasn't even edited (paragraphs in the wronf places, sentences that don't make sense). This was in english written by Americans, lol."

2021-04-11 16:48:03,wallstreetbets,"This is laughable. China NEEDS alibaba to ensure their “made in China” vision. Alibaba controls basically the entire independent logistics market in China. They’re now one of the most advanced domestic chip manufacturers in the country. They own more than 50% of the digital payments market. They own the most successful new grocery chain in the country-Huma. They control dingtalk which has become chinas homegrown version of zoom used by schools and businesses. Internationally, they’ve begun taking control of international e-commerce markets through Lazada and Daraz. They’re invested in Africa’s leading e-commerce site (Jumia) through their Jade e-services subsidiary. They’re the leading investor in PayTM which is the leading digital financial service company in India. If China severely hurts Alibaba on an international level by taking control of the company, it sets them back more than a decade. Chinas currently using Alibaba to spread their influence internationally and they couldn’t do that if the government took control of the company. They need Alibaba to be independent, but they still wanted to let them know who’s really in charge and they did that through these investigations and penalties."
2021-04-11 16:41:55,wallstreetbets,"Yep, for those who don't know.

As stated, foreign investing in Chinese companies is illegal in China. So when you're buying BABA, you're not actually directly buying BABA, you're buying a not-Chinese™ shell corporation tied to BABA... which is basically just an IOU, not a real share. So when the CCP tells BABA to cease and desist, you're SOL and you're money went poof."
2021-04-11 17:43:13,wallstreetbets,When has China done something on that scale in the past 5 or 10 years?

Never seen a real NIO in my life and it’s closer to luckin coffee than BABA. FWIW I trust both companies are real but to say ali baba is a scam and nio is not or Ali baba is tied to CCP but NIO is not doesn’t hold up at all and honestly sounds casually ignorant at best or casually racist at worst. I may be American, but I am of Chinese descent and one thing I have learned growing up here is that Americans don’t like Asians and don’t care to differentiate between any of us. Just look at the news today. And look at what happened to Vincent Chin. Killed for being Japanese... except he wasn’t."
2021-04-11 10:33:54,wallstreetbets,"The OP is trying to convince us to buy BABA, yet when I first read about their ownership structure, where BABA shares actually buy you some equity in a company in the Cayman Islands, and don't actually buy you an ownership stake in Alibaba, I laughed.

Trying to convince us of fundamentals when the company doesn't actually follow GAAP. Laugh.

Trying to convince us it is a value investment when the fundamentals don't even match the company you'd be buying into. Laugh.

Trying to convince us we should invest when China doesn't even allow foreigners to hold title in Chinese securities. Laugh.

Ignoring the fact that they are widely known for selling counterfeit goods. Laugh

It's madness, an ape response is fitting, you all have lost your mind, might as well buy penny stocks based on your astrological sign."

2021-04-11 10:00:38,wallstreetbets,"It’s all fear. Here’s an excerpt of a article that was recently published in the Washington Post.

“In his initial findings, detailed in an op-ed for The Washington Post, Pape determined the rioters to be 95 percent white, 85 percent male, middle and upper middle class, and — significantly — to hail mostly from counties where the white population is shrinking fastest and the non-white growing most aggressively. Such counties were six times more likely to produce rioters than counties where demographic change was least dramatic, a disparity that held even when controlled for various variables.

Coincidence? Pape says the chances are less than one in a thousand. So assuming his findings hold, we may conclude that, while there was anxiety here, economics had nothing to do with it. This anxiety was racial.”

America has a white male problem.  Anyone surprised?  I’m a white male and I see it.

2021-04-10 23:09:29,wallstreetbets,Thanks imma need it. Otherwise its $500 SPY Calls for Jan 22
2021-04-11 12:09:14,wallstreetbets,The 65 or the 412?  If 65 is double your salary where did you find 10+ years salary to invest?
2021-04-11 15:33:32,wallstreetbets,Plus it's not like you could afford treatment any more anyway ;)
2021-04-11 11:58:47,wallstreetbets,Yes but isnt it more impressive that you managed to lose money on an ETF that can only go up?
2021-04-10 23:21:20,wallstreetbets,Uh 16 GB I think
2021-04-11 01:19:04,wallstreetbets,True... I stand corrected
2021-04-11 12:04:22,wallstreetbets,WTF are you on about?
2021-04-11 12:22:46,wallstreetbets,"You don't just have to get to $35 you gotta get way above that for those calls to make good money. 

If it got to $35 that would still leave those calls at a loss due to theta decay. I got rid of them early for this reason. 

I only have $30 calls now and shares."
2021-04-10 23:41:22,wallstreetbets,Why not 490 SPY calls
2021-04-11 10:01:52,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand what you've done, help"
2021-04-11 12:10:30,wallstreetbets,I got lucky on the first GME squeeze

2021-04-10 23:54:23,wallstreetbets,Get 128GB.. you can have 200 tabs open and not even break a sweat.. can confirm this as I regularly have tons of tabs open across multiple windows that I forget to close while working in 3D softwares...
2021-04-10 23:43:56,wallstreetbets,Why not 480 SPY calls
2021-04-11 16:15:02,wallstreetbets,Ohhhhhh the tax man comin
2021-04-11 18:31:20,wallstreetbets,So you won the lottery and decided to spend it on scratch tickets?

2021-04-11 01:02:02,wallstreetbets,Why not 470 SPY calls
2021-04-11 16:51:03,wallstreetbets,"For real and then to YOLO it all... guh. 

I really hope it works out for him. 🙏"
2021-04-11 19:34:01,wallstreetbets,So? I have a government job
2021-04-11 01:17:30,wallstreetbets,Why not 460 SPY calls
2021-04-11 16:52:28,wallstreetbets,"Could you imagine making 400k out of nothing, losing it all, and STILL have to pay taxes on the 400k?? Dicks out for this guy, gents"
2021-04-11 02:01:10,wallstreetbets,Why not 420 SPY calls
2021-04-11 18:15:54,wallstreetbets,If I make 400k in profits and take a 400k loss so long as I sold 30 days after I bought it isnt gonna be a wash sale. I wouldnt owe any taxes
2021-04-11 17:00:56,wallstreetbets,Let's hope this is after he set some aside to pay them. Idk what I would do in that situation myself lol
2021-04-11 18:09:30,wallstreetbets,Unless he loses it all correct?
2021-04-11 04:29:29,wallstreetbets,Why not 400 SPY Puts?
2021-04-11 02:29:21,wallstreetbets,Why not PLTR calls
2021-04-11 18:15:05,wallstreetbets,File for bankruptcy probably. Given this guy's ability to manage his finances.
2021-04-11 04:41:27,wallstreetbets,444 spy puts
2021-04-11 11:56:56,wallstreetbets,Because you have to be a full retard to buy puts against SPY. The only person who can reasonably do that and not get fucked is Michael Burry

They are also one of the most shorted stocks on the NYSE.

2021-04-11 07:14:33,wallstreetbets,"I’d say our generation of teen movies started with Napoleon Dynamite (my freshman year of high school)  and ended with Superbad (my senior year of high school).  [Here is IMDB’s list of 2000s teen movies](https://m.imdb.com/list/ls031405946/) and although there were some gems, I don’t think they are as iconic as 80s John Hughes."
2021-04-11 07:55:34,wallstreetbets,Dazed and Confused is great!
2021-04-11 01:17:19,wallstreetbets,"Ferris buller I agree with. Breakfast club is honestly a mediocre movie at best, it was heavily carried by the soundtrack which were literally all the hits of the era."
2021-04-11 00:25:07,wallstreetbets,"It isn't great IMO, but I'm Gen X and we had horrible ass ""road trip"" romcoms that were ""funny"". So in that regard I envy having something sort of genuinely cheesy rather than the apple pie fucking shit we had."
2021-04-11 01:31:27,wallstreetbets,"Imo, Superbad is 10x better than those two combined.    
     
DD: I would (and probably will) watch Superbad ten times before I ever sit thru either of those others again."

Ferris is cringe af and those 80s stoner stereotype coming of age movies suck. Fuck those boomers."
2021-04-11 10:37:07,wallstreetbets,American Pie was first. Sorry to say but Super Bad was just a rehashing of American Pie.
2021-04-11 03:04:17,wallstreetbets,It came out the same year I graduated high school. Spoke to me deep.
2021-04-11 03:30:26,wallstreetbets,"as someone born on the razors edge of millenials and gen x, i got to enjoy all of those movies at the time they came out. and probably in a good order, as super bad is definitely more crass than the others you mentioned, and isn't something that an 8 year old should ever really watch."
2021-04-11 04:37:24,wallstreetbets,Movie name?
2021-04-11 05:45:59,wallstreetbets,"SB is great, American Pie is better."
2021-04-11 07:36:06,wallstreetbets,Not Another Teen Movie is pretty good as well.. but this is prob the tops.
2021-04-11 10:25:09,wallstreetbets,"Check out Booksmart, I consider it almost a spiritual successor to Superbad."
2021-04-11 02:54:24,wallstreetbets,"Poor you. I was born in the early 80s and all we got was American Pie (which I didn't like).

Like you can just offer naked calls and puts but cover it with a less OTM one to cover your ass, right?  Then that difference will end up being your potential moneymaker, in addition to the premium."

I sell freshly picked apple to you for $1. I walk away with a mighty fine dollaridino.

You try to sell apple for $1.5. No one want to buy old apple for $1.5.

One person offers you $0.5 for the apple. You don't sell apple at that price. Apple turns moldy, no one at all want to buy apple anymore. Value of apple is $0.

TL;DR: short $AAPL"

2021-04-11 03:54:16,wallstreetbets,"I think it's so uncomfortable because it's so real for a lot of people who have shown up as a friend of a friend's friend at a party and not known anyone. The whole vibe is really weird, the house was built in the 60s, and everyone looks old enough to have kids that could possibly have kids of their own.

 There's a weird smell of burning cat piss and cigarette smoke that everyone is ignoring.

The air has a weird Halloween like tension to it like when you're lost down a weird street in a neighborhood you're hot familiar with.

In the house are two groups of people who are clearly looking for a reason to fucking kill each other, but before they can start to scrap inside the house and ruin the place a roided out monster of a man screams at all of them to ""Respect Matt's House and take it the Fuck Outside!"". They're all too terrified of him to actually fight each other now so the fight fizzles out when they step outside and one group just leaves.


It kinda feels like that kind of party."

My brain rejected your claim that there were only 8 years between American Pie and Superbad. Because Superbad came out in like 2008 and that wasnt long ago. 

But American Pie was a long time ago (or at least in my head)

Nope only 1999. Seems longer tbh. Would have guessed 96"

2021-04-11 16:37:46,wallstreetbets,"If we create a fully autonomous system with non-human bots silently and unobtrusively groking everyone's online activity, only flagging human operators for further investigation under carefully audited conditions, which is more important: privacy, or the life of an 8 year old girl who we saved from abduction because a predator's online-activity profiled them as a would-be serial killer - alerting the authorities in time before he acted, allowing careful monitoring and catching them *after* their first crime instead of after their fifth?

2021-04-11 10:01:56,wallstreetbets,You don't have to have the shares to sell a call. To protect your ass you should though lol. I got a couple hundred shares of SNDL and sell cc at 1.50 expiring every other week unless it's already up then I hold. It's only 4 - 5 dollar premiums but eventually that will get me 100 more shares to keep increasing my money. I could just buy a shit ton more but why pay for shares with my own money when their are degens that will eventually buy them for me lol its infinite money that doesn't cost me a dime!
2021-04-11 01:18:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah of course. That's why I suggested not to do naked calls. If things go wrong, you'd be ultra fucked.  It's better to slowly build up to 100 shares and start writing CC's."
2021-04-11 17:05:19,wallstreetbets,But i think you have to have some money in the account for a long time or some kind of permission to use then. Least thats what i thought
2021-04-11 01:11:48,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Pltr is the only meme stock I have. The rest of my CC's are boring sideway crabs.
2021-04-11 00:14:18,wallstreetbets,"Seems like a good way to force yourself to only do it on shares you've already done a proper DD on, but nearly all of my money is in index funds.

But god do I feel that"
2021-04-11 02:37:09,wallstreetbets,"American Pie came out my senior year of high school. We skipped school to go see it. So it was, like, the movie *of* our generation. 

But Superbad came out and we all saw it and realized it was a nostalgic movie about our generation and we didn't even know we were ready for nostalgia. That's why it fucked with our heads. It's the ""Oregon Trail"" generation of movies."

2021-04-11 12:05:28,wallstreetbets,Exactly! There you go! I've been buying more shares with the CC premiums I write. You guys who buy calls are buying me more shares putting free money in my pocket to just run up my shares to write more CC's. Eventually the premium will break even what I originally invested for the stack of 100 shares.

2021-04-11 08:14:38,wallstreetbets,"I have friends who used to sleep in shelters, I have relatives in social housing, I make due with an income replacing allowance for the disabled.

There's nothing funny about this maybe I'm a 40 year old sour puss, when I was younger I would have loved the same ""dark humor"" but it's not something to laugh about once you've seen and experienced financial hardship.

To each his own, but this is one huge collection of privileged people joined by a lot of people hoping to get out of their poverty following the advice of the ""army of market manipulating redditor speculators"" as the media loves to frame this place. Heck every time something is going up in the stockmarket the more sensational papers in my country love to invoke ""the reddit army of investors"" as being behind it. I joined expecting to find a list of companies this place was going to target so I wouldn't miss the next gme train to being rich. Still fomo'd everything I could miss in GME at it's height so I don't have any money to join the next train.

I'm getting slowly frustrated I guess I missed the train that can't be mentioned without provoking the automoderator because I believed that to be crazy and well every serious person said it was a bubble because there's nothing real behind that certain investment. Saw 2 chances of getting rich slip by me that way, then the GME thing happened and I fomo'd into that at the wrong moment.

I know it's all my own fault but it still frustrates to have all these privileged people here boasting about all the money they wasted and others encouraging it and still talking about themselves as normal common people and retail traders

sorry for the rant, have a lot on my plate (also in the personal sphere, my single mother sister in law has developed psychosis, had 3 of her children placed in foster families, wasted her inheritance on basing cocaine and 6 months ago gave birth to another boy who is living with us since and has been placed in our care. She's back in a psychiatric institution for now but who knows when they let her go again for being ""untreatable"") and needed to vent some of my frustrations.

I'm fucking tired, realized about a day of 4 or 5 ago that the whole gme 1 million per share moass is probably a delusional idea and feel angry and empty inside, I know I shouldn't have but at a certain point when people where talking about what they where going to do I actually started making plans, looking for the best way to secure a passive income with half of the money I was going to make with my 10 shares and actively looking at a car and toying around with the configuration tool, planning how to fix the house and add to it etc... etc... etc....


Again sorry for ranting."

For example, mask has to be worn 100% of the time, even when sitting at a BJ table that is completely encased in plexiglass, can't move your beer from seat to seat, if you get up to do anything you lose your drink, EVERYTHING has a waiting list so if you go with a buddy or two, there's almost no chance you can sit at the same table and play together, and no games that involve you touching cards (Baccarat, Poker, etc.).

TL:DR = Facebook is the most profitable, yet undervalued, tech stock you can buy. Period.

**MARCH 26, 2021**

**Brief History, Founders, Locations**

Facebook was created in February 2004 at Harvard University by Mark Zuckerberg (Founder), Eduardo Saverin (Financier), Dustin Moskovitz (Programmer), and Andrew McCollum (Graphic Designer)(Mezrich, 2009). Using $20,000 USD raised by Mark and Eduardo, Facebook operated for a few months before moving to California to raise more capital (Mezrich, 2009). They soon attracted the attention of Peter Thiel and a few other angel investors. Together, they raised $500,000 in a convertible note with the stipulation that Facebook needed to reach 1.5 million users by the end of 2004 (Kirkpatrick, 2010). The company continued to grow relentlessly after that first year. Annual revenues exceeded $1 billion in 2010 with a business model focused entirely on advertising (Kirkpatrick, 2010).

In 2012, Facebook went public through an initial public offering (IPO) in May 2012. By September 2012, Facebook had over one billion active users and acquired the social media website, Instagram for $1 billion (“Facebook to Acquire Instagram”, 2012). In 2014, Facebook acquired WhatsApp, a smartphone instant messaging application (“Getting the Messages”, 2014). During that same year, Facebook also acquired Oculus VR, a virtual reality startup (Zuckerberg, 2014). In recent years, Facebook has become somewhat of a pariah within the public view and this negative sentiment has affected the valuation of the company. The company is often accused of being invasive, breaking antitrust laws, and avoiding taxes through international subsidiaries with favorable business tax codes (“Facebook Paid £2.9M”, 2012).

Facebook is headquartered in Menlo Park, California and has over 50 offices located around the world. Facebook also has 16 data centers around the world, which are critical to their operations (“Facebook Office Locations”, n.d.). Facebook also owns several subsidiaries that enable them to operate worldwide. The company continues to maintain a fairly aggressive mergers and acquisitions program to expand its portfolio of products and services.

**Mark Zuckerberg**

Facebook is still founder-run by Mark Zuckerberg, who is the incumbent CEO. Mark studied computer science and psychology at Harvard University between 2002 and 2004 (“Mark Zuckerberg”, 2021). He dropped out of Harvard University to focus on building Facebook and has been the CEO since the company’s inception. In 2015, he also founded a non-profit organization with his wife, called the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (“Mark Zuckerberg”, 2021). The non-profit is unrelated to Facebook’s operations, but it advances the interests of science, education, justice, opportunity, and community. Mark lives in Palo Alto, California (“Mark Zuckerberg”, 2021).

**Industries, Employees, and Products**

Facebook employs over 58,600 associates around the world and is classified under the Communications Services sector. Within this sector, they are classified under the Interactive Media & Services industry. Some of Facebook’s largest suite of products are included in the chart below:

**Consumer Products**

1. Facebook
2. Instagram
3. WhatsApp
4. Boomerang
5. Messenger
6. Facebook Payments
7. Lifestage
8. Facebook Moves
9. Facebook Marketplace
10. Oculus VR
11. Facebook Gaming

**Business Products**

1. Facebook Ads
2. Facebook Business Manager
3. Facebook Creator Studio
4. Facebook Audience Insights
5. Facebook Audience Network
6. Instagram Business
7. CrowdTangle
8. Spark AR Studio
9. Facebook Campus
10. Facebook/Instagram Shops
11. Origami

**Current Financials**

At the time of this writing, Facebook had the following financial information and ratios (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.):

Shares Outstanding: 2,847,670,000

Market Cap: $793.8B

Profit Margin (TTM): 33.9%

Profit Margin (MRQ): 39.97%

Free Cash Flow (2020): $23.63B

Debt to Equity (D/E: 9.56%

Debt to Capital (D/C): 8.01%

Gross revenue for 2020 was $85.96 billion with an operating revenue of $32.67 billion and net revenue of $29.14 billion (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.). Facebook has an extremely healthy balance sheet with $61.95 billion in cash and $31 billion in total liabilities (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.). As of December 31, 2020, Facebook had $77.34 billion in retained earnings and shareholder equity has been growing consistently year-over-year since the company went public in 2012 (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.). The company also maintains high levels of liquidity as its current ratio is consistently higher than 1.0 and as of December 31, 2020, the company had a current ratio of 5.0 (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.).

**Stock Price, Price Target, and Options Greeks**

Facebook’s next earnings report will be for Q1 2021 and is expected to be reported on April 27, 2021. The consensus estimate for EPS is about $2.37 and there is no doubt that the company will exceed this EPS target (“Facebook Earnings Whisper”, n.d.). Facebook is currently trading around $280 per share and at a PE ratio of 27.6 (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.). The PEG ratio is 1.28 and this suggests that Facebook is one of the cheapest tech companies an investor could buy today (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.). 

Historically, Facebook’s PE ratio has averaged around 32.8 and the average tech company has a PE ratio of around 40 (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.). If Facebook sees earnings multiple expansion in the same fashion as the typical tech company, this implies a $333 price target. Given the current environment with zero interest rates policy (ZIRP) and “there is no alternative” (TINA) fueling equity inflows, it would not be surprising to see the Facebook stock price rally to $400 by the end of 2021, especially if its PE ratio expands towards the 40 mark. Facebook will likely become the next trillion dollar company by market capitalization and it will reach this milestone once the share price hits $353, assuming no other shares are issued (“Facebook Financial Statements”, n.d.).

Looking at the derivatives market, the April 30, 2021 options have the largest open interest of 1,763 at the $320 strike for calls and an open interest of 642 at the $265 strike on puts (“Options Chain: FB”, n.d.). This implies a move of +/- 15% given the current price of approximately $280/share. 30-day Historical Volatility (HV30) is about 35% and the current Implied Volatility (IV) for Facebook is 35% (“Options Chain: FB”, n.d.). This suggests that the premiums for these contracts are as expensive as they have been in the past. Current shareholders of round lots should consider selling weekly call options to collect extra income. Prospective shareholders should consider selling weekly puts to collect income and acquire the stock at a lower cost basis.

**SWOT Analysis**

Facebook's greatest strength is its advertising solutions that it provides to businesses. This is especially helpful to small businesses that often have simple advertising budgets and need to drive as much return on ad spend (ROAS) as they possibly can. Contrary to what a low information public perceives, Facebook does not sell user data and they do not sell personal data (“Does Facebook Sell My Information?”, n.d.). The company uses data that is voluntarily given by their users to provide advertisers highly targeted, anonymous, audiences for their advertising needs.

Their weakness is also related to their core revenue model in that Facebook’s business is driven almost entirely through advertising revenue. Having such a highly concentrated business model leaves the company vulnerable to headwinds. As mentioned on the Q4 2020 earnings call by Wehner, “We also expect to face more significant ad targeting headwinds in 2021. This includes the impact of platform changes, notably iOS14, as well as the evolving regulatory landscape” (“Facebook Q4 2020 Earnings”, 2021, p. 9). Apple will make it harder for publishers to run digital advertising for users on iOS14 and this will present a problem to many businesses.

Facebook’s short-term opportunities include efforts to further monetize their portfolio of other applications and digital properties. If Facebook can continue to commercialize Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR, these properties will fuel continued revenue growth. For example, virtual reality is emerging technology and there is massive potential with Oculus VR to provide entertainment through virtual reality games, tourism, education, and more. As a segue into the threats, another opportunity for Facebook is in public relations and educating a low information public about Facebook’s operations and combat misinformation.

Facebook’s threats are concentrated around government intervention. Between a low information public and a low information government body, Facebook faces a very real threat from antitrust litigation and repealing section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA). Section 230 protects website owners from civil liabilities due to user generated content and allows platforms to regulate content largely as they see fit (“47 U.S. Code §230”, n.d.). Both Republican and Democrat administrations have expressed their desire to repeal section 230 which could potentially eviscerate Facebook and other internet companies if that were to happen.

**Conclusion**

Facebook should keep doing what they are, as it is clearly working and has been working for about a decade now. To remain competitive, they should focus on expanding their revenue outside of advertising. This can be done through mergers and acquisitions or new product introduction.  If they do not wish to diversify their business operations outside of advertising, then they should consider paying a dividend and improve operating margin expansion. If interest rates were to rise over the next year or so, that should not pose a problem to the company since they have high levels of cash, negligible debt, and impressive margins. They should also keep their expenses in lobbyists and lawyers to protect themselves from antitrust litigation or legislation that may result in section 230 being repealed. Finally, they should launch a series of PR campaigns to influence public opinion as the company is routinely subject to controversy, both real and imagined. Love it or hate it, the bottom line is that Facebook is an extremely profitable company that is wildly undervalued by the current market when compared to its peers.

Since FB competes with mainstream media for advertising dollars, the media has been ceaselessly working to lower Facebook’s status. It seems to have succeeded in terms of lowering Facebook’s status among journalists and media pundits, but it seems to have failed to change mass behavior, much as the thousands of essays about how TV is bad failed to change TV habits. Most media pieces attempting to lower Facebook’s status use every kind of rhetoric conceivable except the numbers Facebook cites in its quarterly reports."

Hence by definition any mkt price of shares over say $70 is beyond 30 as a PE multiple.

The EPS PE and Market price per share has to be in alignment (internally consistent) simply because a PE is the current market price per share divided by the earnings per share.

2021-04-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TQQQ is an excellent long term investment, even with 50+% volatility. I am making this post because this information is not out there and it seems like most of the ""real investors"" want to ignore these statistics.

I posted this over in r/stocks and the reception was not too positive so I thought to myself, ""who would be dumb enough to agree with me?"" Well, here I am!

Every time someone talks about TQQQ they only have negative things to say and they don't talk about it like regular long term investments. There are quite literally zero backtests that treat it as a long term investment. With a long term investment you pick a fund or a few funds, buy in and then consistently put money in no matter what the market is doing. But no one seems to acknowledge that if you chose to use the same strategy with TQQQ, even with it's exorbitantly high volatility, it will ALWAYS out perform a regular LT investment.

Instead when people talk about TQQQ they talk about it the exact opposite way that you're supposed to use the stock market; they try to time the market. ""Leveraged ETF's shouldn't be held for more than a day"" they say. So let me show you what the data says when you continually invest every month no matter what the market is doing for 10 years. 

This is simply analyzing TQQQ, starting with $1000 and putting in 200 every month. Obviously you probably don't want to hold 100% TQQQ and common advice is to put in 10% of your income. 200/month is 10% of your income if you make 24k a year. Whereas the average income for individuals in the us is 31k (3100 a year invested) and the average household income in the US is 68k (6800 a year invested). I will post adjusted numbers for that over 10 years at the bottom.

http://imgur.com/gallery/RlbXBAN

Over 10 years TQQQ would return 19,237% ROI despite dropping more than 50% 3 times over the course of the 10 years. QQQ, with a downside of no more than 17% returned 3,461% in the same time frame. That is the equivalent of 5.5x greater return than QQQ.

And if you want to talk about trading psychology we can do that too. To continue to hold even in a downturn of over 50% just look at the percentage gain over the life of the investment. The investment could lose 96% of it's value (which is incredibly unlikely) and you would still have more than you initially invested. I mean in a bear market most people just distance themselves from the market and just continue to buy despite what's happening in the market anyways.

Do I think this investment strategy is for everyone? No. Its clearly not. But I'm 25, I have 40 years until I need this money anyways. Its definitely not for the feint of heart and if you can't manage your thoughts and emotions in a downturn then stick with regular, low risk etfs. But I can tell you this, the NASDAQ is mostly tech and tech is not going anywhere. Also market indexes are some of the only assets that can and will quite literally grow forever. Over time wealth redistributes; as larger companies die or are split up, smaller company's come up and take their place and indexes pick up these new stocks to continue to grow. 

TLDR: the NASDAQ isn't going anywhere, tech will continue to grow, the backtests show that higher volatility (while significantly more stressful) is very much a good thing if the asset maintains value despite fluctuations.

Other results for average incomes:
1,000 initial investment, 259/month 32,080 total invested, 608,561 10y return
1,000 initial investment, 568/month 68,040 total invested, 1,261,642 10y return"
2021-04-10 20:02:53,wallstreetbets,"So this strategy already exists and is considered a relatively safe investment with at least 30 percent bonds (which would provide you roughy 210% percent exposure to the stock market). It is usually done with UPRO for the S&P although some of the more adventurous individuals also use TQQQ. The bonds are also leveraged 3x to protect downside. There is a whole thread on Bogleheads dedicated to it with years of DD by some of the most safe oriented investors you can find (very different from the Wallstreet Bets audience): [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=288192](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=288192)

There is also a work by Yale economists Ian Ayres and Barry Nalebuff that popularized the notion of ""Lifecycle Investing"". They look boring enough as individuals that I'm inclined to take them seriously: [http://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/](http://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/). I have read the book and it tests the strategy across even the worse markets.

That said. You will need to rebalance about quarterly to make this work. The current recommended way is through M1 finance, which provides a simple option. It is what I use myself. I'm not paid by M1 or anything. I just found it from this article when searching information about this approach: [https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/hedgefundie-adventure/](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/hedgefundie-adventure/)

The paper you have linked to seems to be missing large parts of the myth busting around leverage etfs. The original paper is entitled *""*Alpha Generation and Risk Smoothing Using Managed Volatility."" It is available here: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=1664823](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1664823)"
2021-04-10 22:32:53,wallstreetbets,"Remember, the Qs are the top-100 companies. As they come and go, the index rotates to continue to hold the top-100 companies.

My firm runs a rules-based strategy on the Qs and the TQs with great success. But you’re right; it isn’t for the feint of heart."
2021-04-10 20:18:34,wallstreetbets,Ive got $10k in TQQQ rn.  Still buying more.  I plan to build my retirement cabin on the shores of the Sea of Tranquility
2021-04-11 10:25:57,wallstreetbets,"You're all gonna call me crazy but I'm working on a thesis on how the 'Santa Claus rally' where stock booms in January is actually a gamma squeeze caused by LEAPs(years out options). LEAPs expire the fourth friday of January every year and TQQQ has run up 32-38% every December to January in the last few year. 

My theory is that if we use options on TQQQ and leveraged SPY like SPXL we can multiply leverage for a gamma squeeze on the index funds and have a whole market squeeze. 

Either way I'm YOLOing everything in my margin account on TQQQ calls in November for February expirations and selling them the fourth Tuesday of January to make more than a two years salary in a month.

I encourage people to look at TQQQ in a 3 month time frame late November to early Feb for the last few years."

2021-04-11 16:01:19,wallstreetbets,If you really break it down buying and holding individual tech stocks isn't really that much different than just leveraging up qqq. The beta of a stock measures how much a stock moves relative to an index and something like sq (with a beta of 2.43) is basically leveraged qqq. If someone is fine with individual stocks they should be fine with tqqq (or using options on qqq.)
2021-04-11 03:19:37,wallstreetbets,"Reasons why TQQQ Excelled:

1) This past decade interest rates were low.

2) This past decade was a bull market.

3) In 2010 people were afraid of QQQ, nevermind TQQQ, because of the Dot Com Crash.  QQQ was still below the Dot Com Crash's ATH.  It was uncommon, unlike today, to think QQQ would outperform SPY.


If TQQQ existed on January 1, 2000, TQQQ would've underperformed QQQ since that date.  I've backtested it in excel even assuming TQQQ can borrow at a 0% rate to leverage.  Just letting you know this past decade was the perfect environment for TQQQ hence why you discovered it.

Also important to note TQQQ is not as volatile as it was 10 or 20 years ago so I wouldn't expect as large of swings in either direction over the next decade."
2021-04-11 01:39:33,wallstreetbets,"I've looked into this, and charted UPRO back from 1987, and you would have done great with rebalancing.  Dut you can also get all the leverage you want rolling QQQ options..  With QQQ options, you are paying premiums, with TQQQ you pay in volatility decay.  One can decide which they prefer.  It's a lot easier to say what TQQQ does long term, but trying to look back with options seems too painful."
2021-04-11 12:30:44,wallstreetbets,I follow this guy Jason Kelly who has a plan that follows TQQQ and a bond fund with a 60/40 stock bond split. Then has rules for when to buy and sell. It’s not as sexy as $800 GME calls but it’s a solid theory

2021-04-11 06:05:20,wallstreetbets,"I hold TQQQ and it’s done really well. I also hold upro

To anyone reading this: I recommend buying upro and not tqqq. Both funds are 3x leveraged but upro tracks the s&p500. The s&p500 has a circuit breaker where if it drops 20% all trading is halted for that day. Because the funds releverage daily upro cannot get wiped out your max loss is 60% in a day. 

The funds will MAYBE not work forever because the leverage is NOT FREE. They pay interest of course. The funds began past 2008 and since then interest has been low and basically free debt so the leverage is cheap and the funds work. Any return to interest rates of before 2000 will probably cause these funds to underperform the index while having higher draw downs.

As long as interest rates remain low you are safe on upro and buying the dip feels a lot better"

Thanks for the shout-out!

/u/bangers132, consider throwing 20-30% TMF in there just as insurance, as [it takes great gains to recover from great losses](https://i.redd.it/7kq21f0kk0p61.png). For example, [here's](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/hedgefundie-100-upro-1.png) 40/60 UPRO/TMF (Portfolio 1) vs. 100% UPRO (Portfolio 2) historically.

I'm actually working on creating some simulation data for TQQQ so we can see back further than 2010. I'll let you know when I'm done.

P.S. - I always send people to [this page](http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php) to illustrate why holding LETFs is perfectly okay. Unfortunately, the financial blogosphere took the scary-sounding ""volatility decay"" and ran with it to erroneously conclude that holding a LETF for more than a day is a cardinal sin, without realizing that the simple underlying math behind ""volatility decay"" actually *helps* on the way up, as you noted from the 5.5x return instead of the proposed 3x. Most people fail to take 30 seconds to understand this simple math and simply parrot the ""Leveraged ETFs are bad."""
2021-04-10 21:57:55,wallstreetbets,"In the biggest bull market in history? Shocker you’d do well in a 3x leverage etf.

Several times in history you’d lose every penny. Eventually, it’ll happen again."
2021-04-10 23:29:45,wallstreetbets,"Maybe not completely destroyed. Look at DFEN. I got in 2/14/20...  they gave me 3x leverage on the way down and only 2x now that we’re going up. I know it’s only been a year but how much longer before someone like me even breaks even?

Or TVIX? They shut the thing down right when it was getting interesting. I agree with OP: TQQQ isn’t likely to see these issues (I have a few grand in it and TECL) but it is something to consider before dumping all your money in. 

Lastly, there was a WSB post a year back or so about some guy who put a bunch of money into TQQQ and promptly forgot about it for like 12 years. Crazy return as OP noted."
2021-04-10 23:29:40,wallstreetbets,It gets destroyed in an event like last year. But it recovers quickly. DFEN on the other hand got destroyed and is still down 65%

As you can tell from the original paper a 3x leverage is too volatile with minimum extra returns. You want to keep it at 65/35 or 70/30. Rebalancing quarterly has been shown to have the best returns and is critical. 

You also don't want to do this with all your money. I do it with an old retirement account from my first job that I rolled over to an IRA. It has done very well. That said I keep my 403b (I'm an educator) from my current job in 100 percent VTI. I wouldn't recommend either if you are past 50. 

Good luck with everything.

2021-04-11 00:23:22,wallstreetbets,Only way for TQQQ to blow up is for QQQ to drop more than 33% in a single day. Show me on the calendar where that’s happened before.

2021-04-10 20:14:34,wallstreetbets,You’re leveraged triple so if it drops by a third you lose 99%.
2021-04-11 06:14:41,wallstreetbets,It really depends on how much you bought before vs how much you bought after. If you are within 10-15 years of retirement you probably have a huge portfolio and will not do well on this if there is a crash. If you are young and it crashes next you and you keep going you will end up very happy
2021-04-11 01:03:20,wallstreetbets,right and in those periods it under performs. isn't this just saying that when the market is performing above a certain level the 3x leveraged fund wins? you're betting on the bull market continuing basically. i'm thinking it's saying (if in a given time period the bull market is greater than or equal to XXX% of the total time TQQQ wins)
2021-04-11 10:22:36,wallstreetbets,"No man I don’t believe you are giving sound ideas. People have said the same thing over and over again as if no black swan events are possible. We saw the same thing happen with XIV before the vol explosion of 2018. SVXY survived but is now half leveraged and will most likely never see all time highs again. 

Brzu is a leveraged Brazilian index and was once 3x. It’s now 2x and suffering to get back to new highs. 

Getting back to new highs isn’t the problem though, it’s the fact that the most probably outcome is this will have an accelerated event leading to delisting as so many other 3x etfs have. Just look at what happened to oil futures going negative last year. 

You can’t use only math and disregard other risks."

2021-04-11 16:56:26,wallstreetbets,"/u/zenoblade and /u/bangers132, I actually wasn't able to go back much further but we get to see the GFC that illustrates what I was saying - 100% TQQQ is probably not the optimal approach because it just takes too long to recover.

I looked at 80/20, 70/30, and 60/40 allocations of TQQQ/TMF compared to 100% TQQQ. [Here are the returns](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tqqq-sim.png) going back to 2003, rebalanced quarterly. [Here are the drawdowns](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tqqq-sim-drawdowns.png).

Note that the differences would be even more dramatic if we could see the 2000 Dotcom crash."
2021-04-11 18:39:17,wallstreetbets,"[/u/zenoblade](https://www.reddit.com/u/zenoblade/) and [/u/bangers132](https://www.reddit.com/u/bangers132/), sorry, the data was right in front of me the whole time to go back further.

[Here's the most telling backtest](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tqqq-sim-1987.png) going back to 1987, using quarterly rebalancing.

Extending it makes adding bonds even more attractive, with 60/40 TQQQ/TMF coming out ahead. 

Notice how for 100% TQQQ it's basically just a timing gamble on entry and exit points for whether or not you beat the underlying. Following the Dotcom crash in 2000, TQQQ didn't catch up to QQQ until late 2007 right before the GFC in 2008 tanked it again."
2021-04-11 00:49:15,wallstreetbets,"It doesn’t need to blow up in one day. If tqqq existed in 2000 and you bought at peak you would *still* not recover  https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/hcr47m/hypothetical_performance_of_tqqq_starting_at/

2021-04-11 10:40:08,wallstreetbets,Yes but not on margin I don't think. Most brokerages refuse to take on that amount of risk. And FNGU doesn't have options because it's too new.
2021-04-10 20:42:28,wallstreetbets,"It does. I started in 2016 and at end of 2019 I was up 287%...I make my family financial plan and year in reviews. Just looked at it

2021-04-10 21:36:15,wallstreetbets,Right I’m saying overall if it drops 33% you lose your entire value technically
2021-04-10 20:46:47,wallstreetbets,"I commented below; the leverage is constructed via swaps and futures contracts. Futures have no time decay (equivalent to a European call option w/ 0 strike hence always ITM) and swaps do not lose value of over time either.

nb if we want to be pedantic futures for commodities might contain ancillary costs such as warehousing / insurance / transport and their value decays over the contract expiry"

2021-04-10 20:12:45,wallstreetbets,Maybe save it and read it later because truly that's not how it works specifically because of cash inflows.
2021-04-10 20:20:27,wallstreetbets,"Yep at which point my cash inflows would purchase 100x more equity than they were before a crash. Which is the whole point of this entire post. Its in the second or third paragraph. If $100 could purchase 1 share before a 99% crash after $100 could purchase 100 shares. If I have 1 share at 100 and it crashes I lose $99, and buy 100 shares at 1 dollar all it takes is 1 dollar change in the underlying for me to recoup my cost. Why is everyone so bad at math and reading."

For example, I bought TQQQ when bottomed last Mar 8th and made money 25% and again sold and repurchased (swing trades).

Having said this, market will soon going to crash, no one will believe in wsb and they negative vote for saying this, but they will realize after a qtr. Current holds are [https://imgur.com/a/cdWhR81](https://imgur.com/a/cdWhR81). I will sell this coming Tuesday (most likely).

**At this time, TQQQ holding is disaster. You buy TQQQ when deep low and hold for long.**"
2021-04-11 12:14:44,wallstreetbets,I’m 24 and have about 10% of my portfolio in TQQQ. I am excited for what the futures holds with this one. Been waiting for an explanation to debunk the returns on this but haven’t quite found a solid one. I think it’s the ultimate passive LT play that is a great supplement to help boost alpha. Make sure to buy the dips when it’s down 50% or more lol. Good luck to ya!
2021-04-11 12:14:42,wallstreetbets,Some of the small and medium cap companies in VTI provide a little bit of a boost on some years. The return between that and VOO isn't really worth thinking much over. I used VTI because it was available in my retirement account from work and VOO was not.
2021-04-11 17:10:12,wallstreetbets,Is this without cash inflows?
2021-04-11 17:28:51,wallstreetbets,"Seems about what I expect. I’v never understood the 55/45 split recommended in the Boggle forum. It seems pretty arbitrary. 70/30 stocks bonds is usually considered pretty safe and often what people measure their returns by. It would make sense that 70/30 leveraged would have good results. You probably know more about the reason that 55/45 is recommended. 

Also I think looking at it the way you have can be misleading. It needs a test with comparison of 100 VOO or VTI. Psychologically I think it is easier to deal with the dips if you realize that it is very unlikely that you will be at point under a 100 VTI portfolio after two or three years since that is probably the alternative people are looking at."
2021-04-11 18:43:09,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for putting this together. I'll look into maybe switching into a 60/40. 70/30 seems to be working for me, and I think is a little better in the current market. It seems like no matter what though, you aren't going to lose all your money with one of these portfolios as everyone keeps saying throughout the thread."
2021-04-11 00:59:53,wallstreetbets,"No, the stat is if it started at the peak, and that’s the only point where you wouldn’t have outperformed. Seems like a moot point if you have to Cherry pick one point in time to match your thesis, vs literally every other point in time in the history the world.

I bought TQQQ last January at ~$100. I watched it go to $33 in the fastest market decline in history. Bought the dip like OP is suggesting here, made me an absolute fuck ton of money. I don’t agree with you at all"

OK boomer. Look. Most people here are 20s-30s and are dollar cost averaging because they get paid every 2 weeks so they buy every 2 weeks. This won’t happen plus we aren’t in a 2000 tech bubble valuations are no where near that"

2021-04-10 21:52:01,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't work that way. It's compounded daily.

If there's a 1-day drop of 20% in the stock market, that puts a freeze on for the rest of the day. TQQQ would have lost 60% of value 

Let's say QQQ starts that day at $100, TQQQ $300. QQQ ends at $80, TQQQ at $120


The next day stocks drop 20% again. TQQQ loses 60% of its value from the start of that day. 

QQQ $80 -> $64
TQQQ $120 -> $48



That's not to say the 3x compounding can't fuck you completely on crashes, but it can't drive you to 0."
2021-04-11 05:29:53,wallstreetbets,"The math relies on stonks going up. Which is not an unreasonable bet, as US stocks have always gone up, especially in the last decade or so we have had one of the greatest bull runs in history.

2021-04-11 13:36:03,wallstreetbets,"When the 99.9% drawdown happens then whatever you DCA”d before the event is essentially lost. So whatever returns later you have would be on later deposits. However you also have a need to withdraw money at some point (be it retirement or purchase) if the drawdown event happens close to that point your new investments will not be able to gain enough. There is another comment pointing out why gains/losses are not equivalent (eg volatility decay).

The only thing saves you is to have part of you portfolio in something not correlated to tqqq and then rebalancing between the two."
2021-04-11 13:19:02,wallstreetbets,"This is false because of math. A given percentage drop destroys far more value than the same percentage rise creates - and it gets worse the higher (the more geared) the value is.

Very simply put: if TQQQ drops by 50% then recovers by 50%, the ticker now only has 75% of the original value.

If it drops by 90%, then rises by 90%, it is still only 20% of the original.

You're not actually buying a unit of the underlying QQQ asset, you're buying a squishy ill-defined approximation of the daily price change that murders you on the dips.

If a 2008 style drop happens at the beginning of your DCA window you'll be fine, if it happens near the end you'll lose most of your value with no real prospect of recovery, even if QQQ bounces back to the same value."

20k in premium on 75 contracts is 2.66 in premium per contract. 1DTE would have left you with contracts ITM. Those are calls at 103 + 2.66 cap you at 105.66. It closed Friday at 107.27, so you lost about $125,000 vs if you just held the shares?"

Biggest issue I see is the amount of people would screw up their hedge for then get blown up if they hit the time of retirement, then have an .com bow up or an 08 market deflation event.

Smart people screw up their hedges all the time.  To paraphrase a quote I recently saw on the Archegos / Hwang implosion said, ‘Massive returns on leveraged, concentrated, hedged positions are often really way over leveraged shit beta ticking time bombs.’"
2021-04-11 10:05:28,wallstreetbets,It really doesn't and if you read the post and the link I posted two comments up you would see that. The stock market could never reach ATH again but if you keep adding to the position and dollar cost averaging the upward movement always exceeds the downward movement.

2021-04-10 20:19:29,wallstreetbets,"No need to fact check the algebra. The TLDR of the document is that 2x and 3x leverage wins. We can fact check by looking at another recent DD, here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk71rt/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_still_going_bonkers_up/

They maintain around 2x leverage across that portfolio, and we can see their results, which endured March 2020 and is still up big"

2021-04-10 20:16:11,wallstreetbets,It took until 2010 for QQQ to reach the same levels as pre 2008 but utilizing dollar cost averaging it would profit well before then. Which again is the whole reason I made this post it's like second paragraph on the post.
2021-04-11 01:14:52,wallstreetbets,Shares. I honestly don't think calls are worth it because of the premium from the high volatility.

There is no secret to the market. As your possibility for returns increases, the risk also increases. The Lifecycle Investment books premise is that it is safer to do leverage early on and ramp down your stock market exposure later when you have a more stable retirement account. The authors discuss the fact that people have way too much exposure to the market when they have a lot more money later in life. 

Put in WSB terminology, you might as well YOLO now when you are young so that if you lose all your money you still have time to make it back."

Also, in 2000, the tech sector traded at over 50 while the rest of the s&p500 traded at around 20. Today its 26 vs 21. Meaning that not only is tech traded at half of what it was in the tech bubble, it also is far far closer to the over all s&p500.

If you owned a mix of TQQQ, UPRO, and TMF pre-covid, and near the bottom of the march dip rebalanced by selling some TMF and buying more TQQQ and UPRO, you'd have made a ton of money compared to holding a ""safe"" mix of non-leveraged index funds and bond funds.

Take that $2000, buy as many calls as you can for next January. If hyper inflation comes, you lose everything.

2021-04-11 04:05:17,wallstreetbets,"It’s not about DCA as the event can happen close to when you want to pull out/retire. The only way to safeguard is to allocate some funds as insurance. For r/investing types this might be holding 40-60% in TLT. For the more adventurous it might be having enough qqq put leaps to have a maximum draw down that you are comfortable with. 

Edit: also if in taxable account maybe use upro etf with spx puts as spx have tax benefits and upro is a little more diversified. In general I want my
Returns to be V shaped; if the market crashes a lot really OTM puts can print incredible returns. In March my put leaps which were like 5% of the portfolio returned 20x and basically saved me, while the market was at the bottom I was up like 60%. (Note my long positions are much more meme than just holding upro; so I am exposing myself to “memes crash but boring market is stable” risk). My main issue is that while the market recovered I only had my original longs and sat on the cash I made from the puts always fearing the second correction."

2021-04-10 20:44:36,wallstreetbets,Who on earth thinks QQQ goes down 5% and up 5% in two days... Also that's not even a good point? That's just a fundamental understanding of how percents work? And in the chart you will see if you look at 2018 QQQ went down .21% and TQQQ went down 20% but it was still worth way more money than if you had invested in QQQ.

2021-04-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"EDIT - everything tastes better crispr This is going to be the first post of 5 regarding crispr, and why it's the play of the decade 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀. Mods, thank you so much for letting me post it. If there's anything I need to do I'm happy to make any *edits* (no pun intended).

The next post will be about their current drug pipeline. This DD series is the product of 80 hours of reading 10-k's, licensing agreements, court filings, and a lot of adderall. 

**Intro**

**What is crispr?** Crispr stands for **c**lustered **r**egularly **i**nterspaced **s**hort **p**alindromic **r**epeats. It's a tool that is found in bacteria that can simply put can edit genes.

**Why should I care?** Crispr is easily on of the biggest discoveries of the 21st century, and [received a Nobel for its discovery last year](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/press-release/). It's not an understatement that in the next coming years crispr will impact just about every part of our lives. It's not just me saying this.[ Bill Gates \(poured in $100M\)](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/bill-gates-thinks-gene-editing-artificial-intelligence-save-world/), and [momma Cathie](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/editas-stock-price-ark-cathie-wood-genomic-stocks-driving-returns-2020-12-1029911942) believe that this is one of the most revolutionary things of this century. [Joe Davis of Vanguard found the idea multiplier to be similar to how the internet took off](https://advisors.vanguard.com/e-assets/articles/FAS008905/Todays-ideas-in-genetics-and-biomedicine-are-multiplying-quickly.png).

If you cannot see this can change the world crispr could help [by eliminating that extra chromosome you probably have](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28633863/#:~:text=CRISPR%2FCas9%20genome%20editing%20can,to%20delete%20an%20entire%20chromosome.&text=show%20proof%2Dof%2Dconcept%20for,embryonic%20stem%20cells%20and%20zygotes). 

**Editas ($EDIT)**

Editas is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on using crispr as a treatment for genetic disorders (in vivo), and for various forms of cancer (ex vivo). 


Their business model is actually pretty smart. They're targeting rare diseases for drug development, and licensing out the IP for crispr. Contrary to popular belief rare diseases are incredibly profitable, and easier to develop. You essentially can monopolize a disease, and the market is so small competitors rarely pop up. The IP though is going to be the breadwinner. Essentially **any drug developed with crispr will give an 8%-13% royalty to $EDIT**. Not to get too technical, but their technology platform is pretty revolutionary, and [far exceeds anything else on the market](https://imgur.com/a/RHVZ6Wn). [They estimate they can target about 95% of the human genome.](https://ir.editasmedicine.com/node/8291/html) 


One drug of note in their pipeline that is of interest is EDIT-201. EDIT-201 is essentially engineered T cells with CARs and Engineered TCRs that have been genetically modified to recognize and kill other cells. This is an interesting treatment solid forms of cancer. This could potentially be an alternative, or complementary to chemotherapy. The collaboration is with Juno Therapeutics (acquired by BMY) who have so far contributed substantial funds towards the project along with resources. Others include sickle cell, usher syndrome, and a form of genetic blindness that are all in clinical trials.


**The patent**

$EDIT has the exclusive license for use of crispr in humans through the BROAD institute. There are 3 main universities fighting for the patent. This has been a decade long quarter billion dollar legal battle over who owns crispr that is coming to a close. [To say the patent battle is simple is a huge understatement](https://mk0labiotecheugl43g7.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/CRISPR-patent-licensing.jpg). But, there is a consensus slowly [forming that $EDIT will acquire the patent](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/latest-round-crispr-patent-battle-has-apparent-victor-fight-continues). The winner for the patent will easily make billions off of the IP. If Broad wins the patent it is the responsibility of EDIT to develop drugs based off of crispr, and license the patent to other companies which $EDIT would collect a royalty of. $EDIT is then set to pay a royalty from that revenue to the Broad Institute. $EDIT already has licensing agreements in place with Juno Therapeutics ($BMY), and [$BEAM therapeutics (page 31-32)](https://investors.beamtx.com/node/6596/html). 


**The catalysts**

Biotech has a lot of catalysts. It doesn't take a lot to send it to the moon. In the short term there's drug trials. [A notable YOLO came from one of our very own with just shares where he turned $12k into $322k in a week](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kahcek/account_was_at_12k_last_week_and_i_expect_to/). Editas is scheduled to present this weekend at the American Association of Cancer Research's annual conference. On December 4th Editas presented data from their EDIT-301 trial, and then [put out a press release](https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-announces-preclinical-data-and-large-scale) which caused the stock to go from $33-$99 the following weeks. **This will be peanuts compared to when the patent is awarded which is why I believe shares, or LEAPs are the safest choice**. The FDA was slowed by covid so I'm expecting biotech to have a big year as they catch up on trials. 

**Positions**

100 @ $23.56

10 $50c 4/16

1 $53c 4/16

20 $60c 4/16

I am long on shares, and will be buying leaps as the trial dates for the crispr patent gets closer. I bought some 4/16 calls because I noticed an incredibly bullish amount of calls for this week last Monday.

**Disclaimer**

I have a degree in molecular bio, and I've been following this closely for the past 5 years. A company that should be on your radar is Caribou Biosciences which unfortunately right now is private. Caribou has the patent for the use of crispr in non-humans which will also be an incredibly lucrative market.

**TL;DR**: One of the most disruptive things ever only has a $2B market cap. Your chance to get on the rocket before it goes to the edge of the observable universe 
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**EDIT**: There's some confusion over the ticker. The ticker is literally $EDIT. The next posts will cover the other 2 companies."
2021-04-10 23:02:43,wallstreetbets,"Great, I’ll add it to my list of stocks to watch, never buy in, and hate myself after it moons."
2021-04-10 20:28:28,wallstreetbets,"For an unbiased look at Crispr companies, below are the current players involved:
* $EDIT
* $CRSP
* $VRTX
* $BEAM
* $SGMO
* $NTLA"
2021-04-11 12:45:43,wallstreetbets,"The big problem I have with this is that ......  the CRISPR patent ""battle"" actually kicked off in the 2012-2014 timeframe and there's no end in sight.  

It should be noted that $EDIT's price spike in January was due to them receiving a legal victory on a specific piece of CRISPR; however, that ruling can still be appealed and the larger battle is still on-going. 

If you are buying this stock thinking that the legal battle is almost over, that is most likely a major miscalculation.


https://www.osler.com/en/resources/critical-situations/2021/making-sense-of-the-battle-for-the-crispr-cas9-patent-rights"
2021-04-10 20:31:04,wallstreetbets,So you're betting on EDIT becoming the winner of the patent. What if this isn't the case? Stock price would surely take a hit right?
2021-04-11 10:51:22,wallstreetbets,Been long EDIT and a few others too small to post here like precision bioscience
2021-04-11 12:04:37,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been looking into CRISPR as well a bit recently, pretty wild stuff. Nobel-prize winning tech will always build hype. 

One thing that makes me a bit unsure of which company is in the best position is the fact that there are still multiple systems being developed, and that there’s a chance for new discoveries to render current versions obsolete. 

From SeekingAlpha: 
“Finally, there are new developments in CRISPR that are not covered by the licenses and patent portfolio of EDIT. One example is Cas12, which reportedly is better than Cas9. Janice Chen, the co-founder of Mammoth Biosciences, a California-based biotech startup, is behind the discovery.”

[Infographic](https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/products/research-arc/infographics/CrisprVizInfo_vol1a.pdf)

It seems like cas12 is more precise than cas9, so where does that leave $EDIT in the long run? 

There is definitely massive potential in this new groundbreaking technology, but is there room for everybody to compete successfully or will there ultimately be one winner that dominates the sector? 

If there is any info that could be provided towards these immediate bullish outlook I would love to jump in early, but at the moment I’m thinking 4/16 calls could be a long shot at this point. OP seems to have significantly more personal knowledge & experience in this field so if there is indeed enough hype that might be all it takes to start an uphill climb."
2021-04-11 14:16:53,wallstreetbets,"When do we anticipate the patent battle drawing to a close? Are there any specific dates upcoming that we can look towards?

Is there any relevant $EDIT news from the conference that can be shared? I bought a spread of 4 contracts Friday, 2 expiring 4/16 and 2 expiring 5/21…

P.S. no disrespect, but the $2B market cap reference is misleading. There’s quite a few players in this space, each having \~$2B+ MC & none of them yet being profitable."
2021-04-10 23:41:28,wallstreetbets,Why not just long ARKG and cover all your bases? Any of those could win the patent battles.
2021-04-11 13:47:56,wallstreetbets,If anyone wants to know more about it there is a great podcast from radiolab that breaks it down so even a retard like me can understand. I'm dropping $3300 on shares at open.
2021-04-11 17:06:04,wallstreetbets,Anyone have a summary of how conference went for edit?
2021-04-10 23:07:33,wallstreetbets,"1. Crispr is mutagenic ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782611/)) ([2](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2623)). I would say actually that due to the way experiments are designed, the mutagenicity of CRISPR is strongly underestimated. This has lead to point 2.
2. CRISPR trials are being halted/cancelled because treated patients are developing cancer within months of obtaining treatment:[https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/02/gene-therapy-trials-sickle-cell-disease-halted-after-two-patients-develop-cancer](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/02/gene-therapy-trials-sickle-cell-disease-halted-after-two-patients-develop-cancer)
3. Though there is much discussion of how to reduce the mutagenic potential of CRISPR, literally nothing yet has been proven, AFAIK, and I have been watching.

Crispr is a wonderful technology that will have dramatic impact in society, be it perhaps by engineering better crops (Roundup ready crops), cold resistant crops, drought resistant crops, and so forth. However, based on the evidence of mutagenicty, it seems highly highly premature to be bullish on near-term returns on crispr gene therapy trials, in my opinion. 

&#x200B;

Disclosures: I have no stock in CRISPR stocks. I research DNA mutation. I really, really want to believe, but I just havent seen any solid data. I would love if someone could give me hope, but I really have not seen it."
2021-04-10 21:23:53,wallstreetbets,"Super bullish on CRISPR as it is absolutely groundbreaking tech, but Glassdoor reviews for Editas are less than glowing, lots of complaints about poor leadership and incompetent execs. Definitely on my watch list though and I'll probably be in for a few shares (and maybe some LEAPS) once I manage to free up some capital."
2021-04-10 22:47:13,wallstreetbets,"Which day of the conference are they presenting? Would buying calls Monday morning make sense? I'll probably just throw $200 to see what happens and not risk too much, or I'll get major FOMO and yolo the rest of it in."

Little more history on EDIT would be good, misses they've had consistent executive turnover which led to the pullback from the highs in January.

Been looking for a good point to get back in on the tech, though seems there will be winners and losers this time and EDIT appears to have a leg up (last sept).  Shares or leaps for sure."

I'm betting all in on Monday"

2021-04-10 23:49:23,wallstreetbets,Fuck it I'm in. I was holding shares of crspr didn't even know I should be edit-ing too
2021-04-11 03:46:10,wallstreetbets,Very nice DD. Already sold me on a company i have already invested in.Next stop Andromeda

*Editas Medicine put volume heavy and directionally bearish*

Bearish flow noted in Editas Medicine with 1,027 puts trading, or 4x expected. Most active are May-21 40 puts and Apr-21 50 calls, with total volume in those strikes near 1,000 contracts. The Put/Call Ratio is 1.93, while ATM IV is up over 8 points on the day. Earnings are expected on May 6th."
2021-04-11 04:51:52,wallstreetbets,You had me at crisp (assuming crispy tender). I’m in!
2021-04-11 11:49:49,wallstreetbets,Buying three shares
2021-04-11 12:32:13,wallstreetbets,Looks good!!
2021-04-11 13:01:14,wallstreetbets,Cool I’m buying some.
2021-04-11 13:23:37,wallstreetbets,Why not just buy CRSP?
2021-04-11 14:39:09,wallstreetbets,"I’m deep in this too.  But I want to double my position.  Hoping to catch a low.  Options are unfortunately really spensive 

FYI other two companies a probably CRSP (Charpentier) and NTLA (Doudna) 

They are the celebrities"
2021-04-11 17:32:30,wallstreetbets,Just wondering......Are u making another DD tonight?
2021-04-11 10:28:03,wallstreetbets,"Meh. Biotech is the easiest way to lose everything. 

Been there done that."
2021-04-11 12:29:04,wallstreetbets,Any update on what happened this weekend?
2021-04-10 20:45:52,wallstreetbets,Is the DD of one your other 2 companies NVTA?
2021-04-10 20:59:01,wallstreetbets,Those $50 calls gonna print ? 🤔
2021-04-10 21:02:10,wallstreetbets,I own this and plan to hold it for 10+ years
2021-04-10 23:21:16,wallstreetbets,"What was it that caused the price to fall so rapidly after that initial press release that shot it up to $90? I’m still somewhat new to trading, only been doing it since roughly December and that worried me a little, still planning currently on hopping in Monday morning"
2021-04-11 03:25:21,wallstreetbets,Isn’t buying options close to earnings or a big reveal bad? High IV and all?
2021-04-11 14:53:20,wallstreetbets,What about SGMO? Their zinc finger tech also seems interesting.
2021-04-11 17:10:08,wallstreetbets,I am seeing so much of awards for a non-GME guys after a long time.
2021-04-11 18:04:25,wallstreetbets,Give me some time to accumulate BEAM before you write that one up
2021-04-11 06:45:18,wallstreetbets,"I am so glad that crispr made its way onto r/wallstreetbets!

2021-04-11 00:58:14,wallstreetbets,So what I'm gathering is that this is in fact going to moon but if you want to make money on it you needed to know about it on Friday at the latest. Because this DD is already to late. Nobody will be able to get in a price that will make money so what the fuck is this for. Disclosure I have limit buy orders for 4/16 calls I just don't think I have a chance at this.
2021-04-11 01:06:57,wallstreetbets,You son of a bitch...I'm in.
2021-04-11 05:58:58,wallstreetbets,"ive been hawking EDIT a lot too. From a technical analysis the entry point is very good. Strong supports at the current level. BUT its a leveraged play, there is a lot of hopium involved. fundamentals are 5+ years away, its a bet on clinical trials.

Having said that, the competitor for ex vivo treatment, CRISPR Th. is 2+ years ahead in his studies with a slightly different approach but still.

EDIT got the in vivo treatment going for them. First clinical data will be published end of the year. IMHO a long leap. If that goes well (mid-dose) than we have lift off. If not, the stock is dead for a long time.

Rn. I think CRISPR th. is the safer bet, although the valuation of EDIT leaves more room for spikes.

Not sure about Intellia, havent looked into them that much."
2021-04-10 20:16:42,wallstreetbets,"Oh how I wish I had infinite money to invest in every sweet-sounding DD on WSB. Alas, I am all tapped out, right now."
2021-04-10 20:31:11,wallstreetbets,Crispr is amazing and that's some incredible DD! It's no surprise crispr is part of ARKK.
2021-04-10 21:16:07,wallstreetbets,I’ll board this rocket on Monday morning. Thanks!
2021-04-11 01:09:34,wallstreetbets,Your 4/16 calls and all these people buying FDs tells me this is a classic WSB moment
2021-04-11 08:09:14,wallstreetbets,"The CEO (James C. Mullen) did not seem to have performed very well during his time at Biogen - even got in a clash with Carl Icahn proxies (e.g. [https://www.cnbc.com/id/29549559](https://www.cnbc.com/id/29549559))  
I wonder if he is up for the task of developing this company further or just there to pocket some money before leaving to another job."
2021-04-11 08:12:39,wallstreetbets,I would put my money in crispr therapeutics all day over Edit or intellia. They have the most cash on hand are furthest along in sickel cell treatment . And are generally the biggest of the crispr  crop

Your options are about to get shit on hard and you need every one of us degenerates to buy 10K shares to dig you out of this hole you're about to be standing in. (Hope they were cheap)

Ever since January 8th, this stock has been a one-way ticket to penny stock territory.

This stock will make a lot of people lots of money, but maybe the world isn't ready to buy into this specific area of Biotech."
2021-04-11 07:52:04,wallstreetbets,This should be a penny stock without a product or revenue. And as a biologist you should know how incredibly hard cancer is.
2021-04-11 06:55:54,wallstreetbets,So it's gone from $90 to $40 since January ....
2021-04-10 21:07:02,wallstreetbets,Not saying it won’t print money but 201 is late to the game. Axicabtagene by Kite (GILEAD COMPANY) has been around for a number of years now. That’s one of two CAR-T names that docs know and love

2021-04-11 01:00:29,wallstreetbets,"> genetic disorders (in vivo), and for various forms of cancer (ex vivo)

2021-04-11 05:13:11,wallstreetbets,"Those patents just delay science by 17 years. I'd prefer society just pays lump sums for such innovations. Even then, it's just using something from nature."

3rd 1 @ 116.72

I am trying to average down while it's still low. It jumped up around 200 at one point. I'm trying to sit at around 5-10 shares before it runs up again. NOBLE Prize was enough for me be bullish on this company."
2021-04-11 06:00:29,wallstreetbets,Anyone thinking about investing into this is either blind or not on many different subreddits. There have been multiple posts about this company that are worded exactly the same (copy/pasta) by many different accounts across different subreddits. Just some red flags of a P&D - be careful.

2021-04-10 21:47:57,wallstreetbets,Looked at the history. What happened on 12/21/20 to make it shoot to the atmosphere?
2021-04-10 22:15:50,wallstreetbets,Why now? The company has been tanking for months.
2021-04-10 22:19:32,wallstreetbets,"I bought 1000 shares at $68 and I have been holding.  Unhappy, but holding."
2021-04-10 22:36:18,wallstreetbets,What strikes/dates have the best liquidity and low bid/ask spreads? I looked briefly and the spreads are pretty wide.
2021-04-10 23:23:18,wallstreetbets,When is patent supposed to be finaled? I've been losing a lot of money on weeklies that never take off lately.
2021-04-10 23:43:12,wallstreetbets,So this how the zombie apocalypse will start. Better start gathering supplies and get a cabin on a remote island somewhere.
2021-04-10 23:52:09,wallstreetbets,"You should have spent some time talking about non-human mods. We are going to able to modify bacteria for industrial uses, where you throw some precursors in the vat and the bacteria produces valuable drug precursors, or industrial materials. The money here is ridiculous but the time frame is also ridiculous. I wrote up an ARKG DD a few months ago when it crossed 100 for the first time, and I held all the way to the peak and all the way through the correction. 

tl;dr Bio is impossible to time, but be long if you can afford to be."

Another one I've had for a while is Gnca. It's a micro biotech so take it for what it's worth. 
They have patented ""inhibigens""
Recently published in Cancer discovery so not a fly by night. 
This will replace TiL therapy I believe and will be really disruptive in the future.

2021-04-10 20:06:42,wallstreetbets,😞if only you dropped this on Friday so I could buy calls
2021-04-10 23:28:26,wallstreetbets,"OP, what was with the huge and drop in the past 4 months?"
2021-04-11 12:32:08,wallstreetbets,"I am new in this game. Could you explain why everyone is looking to place calls for 16th of April instead of just straight up buying on 12th of April?  

Why at the end of the week?"
2021-04-11 17:04:56,wallstreetbets,my pcg calls are already up 11% and the ETF buying cycle has barely started.
2021-04-11 02:19:21,wallstreetbets,"I want to go in too. But I looked at the chart and there was barely any volume. I'm talking about suuuper low volume. I checked the news and found no news catalyst to drive up the stock next week. So, don't understand why OP bought so many calls for next week. Unless he's expecting for news about the conference or something break on Mon. Idk. Plus if you look at the options, they seem to be all over the place and not very appealing at all. Idk about this one. Is there something I'm missing?"
2021-04-10 20:05:31,wallstreetbets,Don’t you dare sell these before Wednesday minimum
2021-04-11 13:42:36,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck bro.  Good luck. I might have gone a little longer lol but my balls are as small as my bank account
2021-04-10 20:01:36,wallstreetbets,"Which company? Crispr is at 100 now, i must have missed something"
2021-04-11 02:05:30,wallstreetbets,"I mean there isn't really anything to cause it to moon premarket. I looked and there is no news articles talking about this conference. Not yet anyways. On Friday the stock only went up by 50 cents. I'm assuming it's because not a lot of people know about it. So, if what the OP is saying is true and some good news comes from this conference that breaks on Monday, then anyone that wants to buy on mon morning should be fine. I'm a bit weary tho, like I said, there is no news articles to act as a catalyst yet. We would only be taking the OP's word on that aspect of his DD."
2021-04-10 21:49:23,wallstreetbets,$edit is a $500 stock. Gold
2021-04-10 20:34:13,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. I’m planning on writing up a DD regarding NTLA, and CRSP.

2021-04-11 02:05:16,wallstreetbets,He's glossing over the fact that they'll have to license out the patent. The universities will own the patent. EDIT has to actually find a use for the technology to treat something and they're only in phase 1 right now of clinical trials
2021-04-10 20:14:10,wallstreetbets,Getting 100 calls right at 9:30am!
2021-04-11 01:52:39,wallstreetbets,"OP is glossing over important details. Namely that the universities will control these patents and license them to companies. $EDIT didn't invent or discover shit (yet). They have to hope that they can successfully apply the technology to treat a disease. As far as I can, they're only in phase 1 for clinical trials so it's very early and very speculative to say they'll successfully develop any treatments."
2021-04-11 12:10:03,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. I'm long ARKG because I trust Cathie's team to cover all the bases. They are clearly passionate and informed in this area. The ETF fee is a small price to pay for their expertise and guidance through the infancy of Genomics. As this technology matures perhaps a leader will emerge but until then I think it's unclear and ARKG is the play. 

Also, Genomics is in so many things that could explode, not just Healthcare. ARKG gives you exposure to those areas too! 

Long ARKG!"
2021-04-11 17:29:59,wallstreetbets,"I agree, most if not all CAR Ts in trials right now use a retroviral vector to transduce the engineered CAR. What would be the incentive for companies to change their manufacturing process to use CRISPR instead?"

2021-04-11 06:00:30,wallstreetbets,Editas uses a different virus vector - the one that doesn’t cause cancer.
2021-04-10 22:56:31,wallstreetbets,"Also, the most attractive calls seem to be 50,55,60,65, and 70 due to the bid ask spread, but the volume for these are terrible. I don't want to get stuck with shitty calls."
2021-04-10 23:17:25,wallstreetbets,It was today.
2021-04-11 11:38:53,wallstreetbets,"Ok I'm a bit better rested. I should have made it more clear, and included a bit more about the patent battle landscape. I'm planning on writing an additional post of it. [This infographic explains it well](https://mk0labiotecheugl43g7.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/CRISPR-patent-licensing.jpg). Each of the university groups on the far left are claiming the patent. The only one that isn't a university (besides Mass General) is Charpentier who is the founder of CSPR. Each of the groups has sub-licensed it out to one of 3 companies (middle). The 3 middle companies then are responsible for their own development, and licensing crispr out to other companies (far right). The far right owes the middle companies a royalty, and the middle company pays a royalty to the university (far left). Despite having the name Crispr Therapeutics they do not own the patent to crispr. It is still within the realm of possibility that she does get it."
2021-04-11 06:48:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but I am going to reply a bit later. I’m trying to respond to everyone. But, it’s 5AM where I’m at, and didn’t get a ton of sleep. I’m going to try to get a couple of hours in."

NTLA is the one I trimmed the most recently. Biotech (especially ones without a drug on the market yet) are highly volatile so there is almost always another opportunity to buy in again if you’re patient. Plus, options for EDIT are a bit ridiculous especially for LEAPs. I’m also setting aside cash for Doudna’s current project, Caribou. Can’t wait for it to IPO."
2021-04-11 17:36:30,wallstreetbets,"I’m hoping to get the next one put out sometime this week. I’m planning on going NTLA, CRSP, final thoughts, BEAM, and then start researching some tickers other users have mentioned."

2021-04-11 17:34:50,wallstreetbets,I know they did a stock offering in January for $66/share so stock dilution played a part I’d assume

2021-04-11 15:08:41,wallstreetbets,"So I hate to cop out, but I have no opinion at the moment. Any biotech play I make I do a decent amount of research before investing. I haven’t done this yet with SGMO so I don’t feel like I’m qualified to give an opinion on it. I’ve had a few people suggest it so I’ll probably start doing research when I’m done with my series.

I disagree with the penny stock comment based off of their existing licensing agreements with BMY, and BEAM. I think it’s actually undervalued now, but that’s just my opinion that should be taken with a grain of salt. I do agree that there is no cure for cancer. I just brought up a trial they’re working on, and a potential catalyst. I will be one of the first to tell anyone that this is not a cure for cancer."
2021-04-11 14:12:07,wallstreetbets,"The catalysts OP mentions seem like they will have little to no impact. They are presenting what look like in vitro cell studies (I'm a chemist not a biologist so feel free to correct my language) on EDIT-201 at that conference this weekend, but either way this shit doesn't seem like it's anywhere near even phase I trials."
2021-04-10 21:59:12,wallstreetbets,"EDIT-201 isn't CAR-T or anything like it.

CAR-T is used against lymphoma (and a few leukemias) through targeting specific cancer antigens. If anything, its more similar to immune checkpoint inhibitors like Nivolumab (Opdivo) that activate T-cell anticancer activity through disinhibition. The NK cells are more robust and do not have any specific target cell. This could have serious intolerable side effects, but it also makes its applications incredibly broad. Who knows where the research will take it, but it definitely has the potential to be game-changing."
2021-04-11 17:38:29,wallstreetbets,There are already a few CAR Ts on the market that introduce genes into T cells. The ones approved and in development use a different form of introducing genes than CRISPR but genetic alteration in patients is already happening

2021-04-11 12:02:25,wallstreetbets,"Hey, sorry for the delayed reply. I'm trying to reply to as many people as I can. I agree with you. Doesn't make it completely better, but the licensing agreement does exempt non-profits along with universities from the licensing fees. The licensing is strictly regarding companies attempting to commercialize it. Plus, the winning university is set to financially benefit over the life of the patent. Not ideal, but at least it's not completely behind closed doors."

2021-04-11 06:36:01,wallstreetbets,"I’m trying to reply to everyone. I have not seen a lot of other research, and have seen the patent rarely discussed. Someone posted a brief DD of CRSP a couple of weeks ago, and I brought up the patent on there. Quite a bit of people were interested which inspired me to write it. 

I can’t speak of all of Reddit. But, I’d love to see it as I’d enjoy talking about it. I take no offense to critique of my research, and the hive minds way of downvoting can hide dissenting opinions even if they are valid. This is my biggest critique of Reddit. In fact, I agreed with most people offering a counterpoint in this thread. I do take offense on the accusation of copy + paste as a p&d. 

I posted a similar play on another subreddit, but it was straight up a gambling play. I was transparent about that. All research is my own, and I can specifically cite my sources across 10-k’s, articles, licensing agreements, and legal filings. Also little hypocritical considering you copy pasted this exact comment word for word onto multiple posts regarding crispr across multiple subs."
2021-04-10 21:47:22,wallstreetbets,You may be thinking of CRSP and not EDIT. EDIT has never been above 100.
2021-04-10 22:32:54,wallstreetbets,"December had several catalysts.

On December 5th, they announced preclinical data at a conference (similar to today), which shot the price up by 15% when trading opened on the 7th.

On December 9th, they sent an application to the FDA, which shot it up again.

On December 17th, they added new board members.

On December 21st, Cathie Wood spoke favorably of it and other CRISPR technology in the ARK holdings, and that was one of the largest catalysts.

A lot of it has cooled down, but we're re-entering the speculative phase as these companies start reporting new results."

If I'm understanding, Editas' advantage through not having to pay royalties.

I also think there needs to be a general distinction between the Broad and Editas in your original post

It can create mutations elsewhere in the genome, known as 'off-target' modifications. Off-target effects are random and can unduly influence other genes or regions of the genome.""

So basically, you would try to use this biotechnology to take away your child's Down Syndrome, but the baby is born with no face, or with scales.

Except not! Because the drug delivered by bacteria. The human body is not going to allow itself to be infected by this shit...because of the immune system. So the gene editing never happens.

If anything, if they wanted to screw WSB users over they would probably rug pull by dumping at some point. 

But that would be a waste of time and money for them because they don't care about screwing WSB over, they care about making money. These are entire businesses we're talking about here, not individuals. There's a reason (many) company policies seem kinda cold and uncaring, if not outright evil sometimes: it's because emotion gets filtered out through the process of group consensus."

As in if you had 8 million dollars and had to spend that all in order to not die, either gradually or all at once, people actually deem it not worthwhile at that point. I kind of get that. Like, I’d think my kids would be better off with 8 million dollars. This was the gist of breaking bad, etc... Insurance companies and governments are probably coming in way lower. FYI, the EPA uses this value to calculate the utility if climate change mitigation efforts in the aggregate, so it’s way different, but I’d pay way more than $29 if I had an incurable disease."

*●The market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.*

>Anything could happen, long-term mooning among possibilities.

Agreed. The biggest risk I would say is another death (like [Jesse Gelsinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Gelsinger)) that scares people and sets the field back a decade. 

People are very irrational with new technologies (if self driving cars kill 1 person they're considered robot death machines, even though they'd be hundreds of times safer than normal cars) and people have a special kind of fear reserved for genetic technologies (muh GMOs) etc. So it wouldn't take much to shake public faith.

Its a long road to operationalising  Crispr. I admire OP trying to dig himself out of this hole...looks like many have failed for it. Not surprised as this sub has turned to dog shit.
2021-04-11 07:23:51,wallstreetbets,I've seen a previous post on here about BEAM be other gene editting technologies. You recommend shares in EDIT as they should hopefully hold the patent?

2021-04-11 13:29:12,wallstreetbets,"How will this affect $BEAM?  There were talks of $EDIT and $BEAM merging together a while back.  Since $EDIT is using first-gen crispr technology, I do believe the second-gen base editing capabilities of $BEAM will eventually offer a better solution.  There are no DNA DSBs, only point mutations, and less off-target effects.  All that being said, $BEAM may be overvalued at the moment, but I'm pretty new to this whole losing money in the stock market thing."

2021-04-10 22:58:35,wallstreetbets,"I think they’ll all do well, at least editas and crispr. I could see them both getting bought by thermo or something."

2021-04-11 01:56:49,wallstreetbets,"Umm, it's not running yet. At all. Seems like nobody knows about this. There is no public news...Yet that can be a catalyst for it to run up. Just the OP's word. Look for yourself. It's been on a huge down trend for months and it just went up 50 cents on friday, lol. So, if he were to go in, he wouldn't be technically chasing yet, cause as I said, it hasn't started running up yet. With all that said. The premiums are all over the place. Go have a look."
2021-04-10 22:50:46,wallstreetbets,What price is considered overpriced?
2021-04-11 01:58:53,wallstreetbets,"It's not running yet tho. Did you look at the chart? It's been on a big down trend for months. It only went up 50 cents on friday, lol. That's because even tho OP is talking about this conference, it seems that he knows about it because he is in that field. There are no news articles about this yet to act as a catalyst to push up the price on the short term. Not yet anyways. So, pretty much we would be taking the OP's word on the options play for next week."
2021-04-11 11:07:51,wallstreetbets,"I personally would. In BEAM’s 10k they talk about their existing license with EDIT. BEAM gave EDIT a few 1.8M/1.2M A-1 shares, and is set up to pay anywhere from $68.8M to $74M per product. In addition BEAM is providing an additional legal expenses to EDIT/BROAD (page 30-31). EDIT will benefit from the success of BEAM. 

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789073/000119312514057299/d659544d10k.htm

Side note: I’m a huge fan of the CEO, David Liu. He actually cofounded EDIT. I think BEAM is a great company, but a little overvalued right now. It’s biotech so there will be another opportunity to buy in at a lower price. If you’re interested in BEAM then I’d just put it in your watchlist, and be patient for the right time to buy in. Hope this answered your question."
2021-04-11 06:56:19,wallstreetbets,There was a small surge Friday for options which threw the ask/bids on some of the popular strikes all over the place. Combine that with relatively low volume on the options. Didnt look like that Wednesday.

CRISPR-CAS9 is certainly the discovery of the decade (technically last decade), but it's a major improvement rather than a new field. It's the invention of the printing press, not the invention of the language."
2021-04-10 20:02:53,wallstreetbets,"It was a grad student's thesis project in genetics, homie of mine from my old bar. It cost him about $2000 from a $10k grant to get the chemicals, he did the entire thing in a small room with a table and a refrigerator. 

2k and you could be making your own too. He said it was surprisingly easy."
2021-04-11 13:35:33,wallstreetbets,"No worries. I edited the DD with a comment regarding BEAM. BEAM has an agreement already in place with EDIT. BEAM gave a few million shares to EDIT as a payment, and is anticipating giving an additional $60M-$70M payment to EDIT for any drug using the existing license agreement. Basically BEAM’s success will benefit EDIT. I like BEAM, and I’m a big fan of their founder David Liu who is also the cofounder of EDIT. If you want to read more about it I included a link to BEAM’s 10k with the page numbers."
2021-04-11 01:31:29,wallstreetbets,He's lying. He posted a screenshot in reply to one of my comments with unredacted orders and they were for 1 share each. He then promptly deleted his comment.
2021-04-11 10:44:56,wallstreetbets,Lmao right! I haven't seen anyone use zinc fingers even in a lab in over 5 years (just finished PhD). Their tech is bad and their management is bad. Don't see them doing well without a giant pivot

2021-04-10 23:18:44,wallstreetbets,"The public perception of genetic technologies does in fact matter to the future of the gene therapy industry. As I noted: in the past, a single death set the field back by at least a decade. That could happen again.

>“The death is the latest in a series of setbacks for a promising approach that has so far failed to deliver its first cure and that has been criticized as moving too quickly from the laboratory bench to the bedside,” the Washington Post reported, in the first of many articles about Jesse’s death and the ensuing crisis it set off.

https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/the-death-of-jesse-gelsinger-20-years-later

>Mostly it’s a convenient technology for editing genes in like viruses, plant clones, and bacteria, etc.

This is how CRISPR is used today (in research labs) because human CRISPR gene therapies aren't mainstream/approved yet. But this is not why the CRISPR companies exist, they are confident in the CRISPR gene therapy revolution (and so am I)."

I never invested in $EDIT or any other first-gen crispr technology because it may soon become a thing of the past.  Any success made (and there will be some), I believe will be short lived, eventually succumbing to advancement in technology.  And since $BEAM is the only company using the sedond-gen technology at the moment, it makes them highly valuable, imo.

Edit: [Here is a great paper in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04252-2) breaking down how all of this works, for anybody interested in some light reading."

2021-04-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"American Tower (AMT): the best way to play the coming 5G boom. **American Tower**

For those of you that actually enjoy reading a good DD, this one is for you. I have followed Wall Street Bets for a while, and personally, I can’t wait for GameStop and AMC to fade away so people actually get back to posting about long ideas that might be worth my time and money. I know that some of you are busy gambling on dying businesses like GameStop or AMC, but I’m here to let you in on a secret.

The company I will be diving into today is the single best way to play the coming 5G boom in America and the expansion of existing cell networks around the world. American Tower (AMT) is the world’s largest REIT with a market cap just over 100B and they are the largest owner of cell towers in the world. Some of you have already checked out because REITs are for boomers, but AMT is growing fast and is a vital piece of the world’s communication infrastructure. If you think that 5-10 years from now people around the world will own more cell phones, make more phone calls, and use more mobile data, AMT is a great way to get a piece of the growing 5G pie.

AMT builds cell towers around the world and then rents them out to telecommunications companies like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile (and the international equivalents). American Tower has over 186,000 communications sites in 21 countries around the world. One of the things that has me interested about AMT’s business model is that they can use a single cell tower to provide service for all three major carriers (and have the capacity to support up to 5 networks), which creates huge margins for each tower.

**Valuation**

Over the last year, the share price has fallen from a peak of 260 last summer/fall to around 240. This puts the Price to FFO (P/E for REITs) to around 26, which is about where it usually trades. I expect AMT to trade in the 25-30 P/FFO range as investors realize the long-term growth runway in front of the company, so there might be some multiple expansion left. I expect that the continued growth of earnings and dividends will lead to a significant increase in share price over the next couple years and beyond.

**Dividend Growth**

I know that most people here aren’t looking for dividends, but it is still worth seeing how fast AMT’s dividend has grown. From 2013, the dividend has grown nearly 5x. Again, I get that no one here could give a shit about dividends, but everything else being equal, rising dividends lead to a rising share price. I don’t think we will see the same rapid growth as the last eight years, but I do think AMT will continue to grow the dividend at a decent pace over the next decade.

Short version: Dividends = free tendies. Dividend increases = more free tendies for shareholders.

**Footprint and Competitors**

AMT has a presence on 6 continents, and they continue to grow naturally and through acquisitions. This January they acquired Telxius Towers, which greatly expands their footprint in Europe and Latin America. Post-acquisition, the company said the revenue split will be approximately 51% North America, 10% Europe, 14% Africa, 15% South America, and 10% Asia Pacific.

Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC) are the only public competitors of note, but American Tower is bigger and has a larger international presence. You can look into both, but AMT is the best way to get international exposure to 5G.

**Customer Concentration and New Edge Data Centers**

The US telecommunications companies make up about half of AMT’s revenue, so there is some revenue concentration. The demand for data and cell reception is pretty inelastic though, so no matter what happens to AT&T, Verizon, or T-Mobile, AMT will continue to thrive. The cell tower market isn’t exactly a monopoly, but because one tower can serve the whole industry, competitors like CCI and SBAC aren’t likely to build new towers in the same locations as American Tower’s existing towers (and vice versa).

They also recently opened six edge data centers (think Fastly or Cloudflare) to keep up with new and improving technology. This is just the beginning, but for a firm that has the resources of AMT, they could choose to expand rapidly if management likes the opportunity.

**Conclusion**

I work at one of the Big 4 Accounting Firms, so I have a pretty good idea of what businesses are worth investing in and which ones to leave for the smooth brained apes around here. American Tower has the management, growth mindset, and secular tailwinds of 5G that will continue to drive market beating shareholder returns.

I have put about 10% of my Roth IRA into AMT and I spent my whole stimulus check on a couple of Jan2023 300 calls a couple weeks ago. I think AMT is somewhere close to fairly priced currently, but the growth and business model mean that buying at today's prices could look like a bargain in a couple years.

I know that a lot of people are going to keep speculating on GameStop, but eventually that will come to an end. If you guys are fine buying companies that lose shitloads of money and have to issue new shares just to stay afloat, that’s fine, but I prefer to buy pieces of businesses that are profitable. Either way, good luck out there fellas.

2021-04-10 22:24:48,wallstreetbets,"Not so fast. New tower builds are in steep decline. And withn the loss of Sprint, AMT and other carriers are losing thousands of site leases.
And adding 5G to an existing site does nothing to change the rest.
Millimeter wave 5G won't use existing towers as cell site concentration needs to be much higher - aka small cells.
The AMT, Crown, etc are not focusing small cell structures as the carrier count is severely limited.

I'm in telecom engineering and am very familiar with the space."
2021-04-10 20:23:46,wallstreetbets,There’s a senator that bought a bunch of this back in....December I think? Great boomer stock. I think it was the head of the comms committee?
2021-04-10 20:39:12,wallstreetbets,"That's some solid DD work, much appreciated! I don't directly invest in AMT but I have FIVG and AMT is one of the holdings. Great to read up on it. 🤙"
2021-04-11 12:30:41,wallstreetbets,"Wow what the fuck a real genuine DD. So I agree that AMT has very strong financials and the fact they're just building a tower of cash on hand in the billions is pretty appetizing too. 

A common concern with this form of infrastructure is disruption through new innovation in its most concentrated North American locstions. What is your exit strategy on AMT if say 4 years from now some engineer dropout develops a more efficient 5G that broadcasts further and hypothetically no longer needs these large cell towers?

Second, why are they so slow at expanding into other markets? I think the most attractive aspect is that they are entering new countries with these hideous towers. Should Canada or the US innovate away the high demand for these, a smaller developing country would likely be their prime customers. What is your expectations of when they would expand more globally?"
2021-04-11 13:26:43,wallstreetbets,So Wall Street bets is about slow value plays now

2021-04-11 14:48:49,wallstreetbets,thanx for the dd!
2021-04-11 16:13:52,wallstreetbets,Not making sense to me I’m not seeing how 5G increases demand for cell towers.
2021-04-11 17:24:31,wallstreetbets,"I heard MRVL, CCI, and NOK are the best 5G plays.  you could be right though because Cramer shit on AMT"
2021-04-11 08:03:26,wallstreetbets,"Also in the industry.  Crown Castle just signed a 15k small cell deal with Verizon and continues to work with Tmobile and Dish.  Obviously the nation is pretty saturated with towers, but with 5G, small cells, DAS, etc. there's still plenty of room for expansion.  CCI  has a better dividend than AMT too... thats my pick anyway.  Not financial advice blah blah blah."
2021-04-10 22:38:00,wallstreetbets,"It’s not like Sprint vanished, they just merged with T-Mobile. Same demand, just three players instead of four. I don’t think new tower builds are all that important in a saturated market like North America. AMT’s growth opportunity is international more than in the US. AMT has shown the ability to grow in the US and around the world. We will see if AMT and CCI are able to build their small cell capabilities, but I trust management to build out small cell capabilities if that is what makes the most sense for the business."
2021-04-11 19:36:06,wallstreetbets,Which 5G infrastructure providers would be good to look into? Have you been seeing any specific areas taking off within the last few years?

2021-04-10 22:38:11,wallstreetbets,understatements of the century right here
2021-04-10 22:02:17,wallstreetbets,"I seriously doubt that satellites around the world will be able to beam connection directly to cell phones. Even if it does eventually happen, I think it will at least take 5 years, and probably closer to a decade. If Elon somehow figures out a way to get all of those satellites up there, I think it’s more likely that the satellites connect with the cell towers and the towers connect with phones. It will be interesting to see it play out though."
2021-04-10 21:58:44,wallstreetbets,"Thinking AMC or GameStop will be able to survive and/or thrive after COVID is just a pipe dream. Netflix and the other streaming services already signed the death certificate on AMC, it’s just that some people haven’t figured it out yet, and COVID definitely accelerated it.

GameStop is just a middle man for video games and gaming equipment and I seriously doubt anyone (no matter how talented they are or what previous experience they have) will be able to turn it around."
2021-04-10 22:03:51,wallstreetbets,"They might specialize in small cell, but I chose AMT because I liked the international exposure and valuation when I bought it. I do think they will eventually add small cell to their services. Should be interesting to see how it plays out though."
2021-04-11 13:32:54,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. I will continue to monitor the technology and innovation just like I do with my other investments. I think that despite the advertising spend of Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, 5G is still in the early stages of adoption. It's mostly in concentrated urban areas, but I think it will take years for the rest of the US to have 5G coverage. 

If some engineering dropout figures out a way to beam reception from satellites directly to phones, then it's not just AMT, CCI, and other tower REITs that are fucked. It's Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile too. However, that will take a lot of time and money (really, a shitload of money), so we will probably hear about it at least two to three years before anything is operational. I think AMT is about as well positioned as anyone in the communication infrastructure for the next decade or so.

As far as the growth, I think that it's hard to expect something like this to happen overnight. They have grown their international tower count by over 5x in the last decade, and I'm hoping they continue to expand, especially into India. I think that if they could get a large chunk of the Indian market we might see growth speed up again. The US market is probably not going to see much growth as far as new towers, but there are over a Billion people in India, so I'm hoping AMT can gain a meaningful foothold there."
2021-04-11 13:34:23,wallstreetbets,At least AMT has some actual value. Most of the meme stocks are just speculations on wild moves in the market.
2021-04-11 12:40:50,wallstreetbets,"I’m not triggered, they are just terrible businesses."
2021-04-11 19:21:43,wallstreetbets,"There aren't going to be a whole lot of new towers in North America. AMT is expanding in Europe, India, and South America. Those markets will be the drivers of growth, but they still make money from North America. It's not that 5G automatically increases demand for cell towers, but they are a critical part of the communication infrastructure."
2021-04-11 11:08:49,wallstreetbets,"Don't bet on the small cells. They were supposed to blast off 2 years ago but they fizzled hard. The economics of small cells are terrible. Everyone its rethinking small cells and trying to make them cost effective. It doesn't help that so many are paranoid about them and don't want them nearby. Zoning is a major headache.

The vertical real estate boom has happened. Now its about ""find revenue"" by charging for every bolt and washer and raising rent. 

At the same time,  equipment is getting more compact and tower footprint is balancing. Instead of 12 antennas, 12 1-5/8in cables, its now one hybrid fiber & power cable, 3-6 antennas and 3-6 remote radio heads.

Fiber is  getting to more sites daily and the need for microwave antennas is dropping.

Just watch out for hype in this space. It isn't all sunshine and rainbows."
2021-04-11 10:51:03,wallstreetbets,"When Sprint and T-mo are in the same tower, one lease gets terminated.
If 2 sites are near each other, one is likely to be turned off and decommissioned."
2021-04-10 22:16:29,wallstreetbets,Her boyfriend approves
2021-04-11 04:40:22,wallstreetbets,"AST SpaceMobile is attempting just that. And American Tower is part of the PIPE, so you're getting some exposure to that by playing AMT. I believe the strategy is to complement traditional cell towers with satellite coverage.

AMT is one of three REITs I own as a small hedge against inflation. But this play is more /r/investing than WSB. (and honestly, I've been thinking of ditching out of AMT)"
2021-04-11 14:02:01,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the reply. I agree that India would be a decent bull run most definitely. Something I really enjoy about the financials here is how low maintenance these towers appear to be when comparing it to the cell service providers. I think I'm very much interested in AMT and infrastructure plays seem to be a safe game in the market right now. I just need a decent entry point.
2021-04-11 13:43:25,wallstreetbets,Emphasis on the wild moves part
2021-04-10 23:54:14,wallstreetbets,"GameStop won't be selling physical games the way they used to. They're completely changing the business.

> The former head of Chewy (**who sells pet food** online) 

I.e. a physical product. Buying a physical product off a website does not make your company 'digital'. Also, Amazon has physical distribution locked up, so good luck with that."
2021-04-11 19:51:03,wallstreetbets,The towers are already up but AMT still makes money off existing towers. It's not that AMT builds the towers for a one time fee. The towers are a recurring revenue stream.

Apparently, I was told that there is a limited supply right now and they aren’t getting a lot of shipment due to the farmers not producing enough of the vegetables/fruits. Especially the organic fruits/vegetables.


Was told that they are raising prices on all fruits/vegetables as early as next week.

2021-04-10 23:45:12,wallstreetbets,Covid has had a huge impact on the ability to bring on seasonal farm labour. A massive amount of fruit and vegetable production is still harvested by hand. I work in agriculture and some growers are dumping or plowing in crops because there is no one able to pick it. This work is mostly carried out by migrant labour and there is zero appetite from local populations to do this type of work (in North America especially)

They miss the mark as far as the trillions of boxes of raw packed produce that are about to start roaring around the country. They do not do the majority, not even close. Grocery/Department retail is buying the majority. Those companies do not handle that transportation.    
      
The trillions of boxes of produce along the the grand reopening of entertainment and manufacturing are going to bring capacity shortages in the trucking sector that this country has never seen. We’ve already been experiencing it the last 12 months.... and we haven’t seen anything yet."

2021-04-11 11:08:53,wallstreetbets,"Couple things, first consumer demand fell off a cliff last February-May/June and the freight market was in the gutter. Rates weren’t high enough to survive unless you planned on getting about 25% of your regular revenue for 4-5 months. Many small biz owners in logistics went out of business. Interesting fact is that 90% of trucks on the road belong to small biz owners that own 20 trucks or less. They are the backbone of the freight industry. Knight Swft, CR England, Prime, XPO, Old Dominion, those mega sized carriers only make up about 10% of trucks on the road. So we’re back to simple supply and demand. Consumer demand has been raising for about 11 months straight, COVID is about over, country is open, manufacturing is coming back, etc etc etc there’s too many loads for how many trucks are available."

Your information suggests that, while the companies mentioned may be on the upswing, we should look elsewhere for opportunities that might take advantage of the upcoming increased demand for produce transport.

My stock tracking software lists the following trucking companies in order of strength: ARCB, TFII, SAIA, ODFL, KNX, USX, USAK, DSKE, CVLG, LSTR are the top 10, but the list goes on.  A little DD on these companies might yield one or two good plays."

2021-04-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Apple-backed Chinese ride service Didi Chuxing files privately for IPO with ~$100B valuation * DiDi is a Chinese vehicle for hire company headquartered in Beijing with over 550 million users and tens of millions of drivers. The company provides app-based transportation services, including taxi hailing, private car hailing, social ride-sharing and bike sharing; on-demand delivery services; and automobile services, including sales, leasing, financing, maintenance, fleet operation, electric vehicle charging and co-development of vehicles with automakers.

*Owner and founder is Cheng Wei, ex Sales Manager of *BABA*, and Regional Manager of Alipay.

In 2014, Cheng hired Jean Liu (Liu Qing), a former *Goldman Sachs Asia* managing director, as the COO of the company.

In February 2015, the company merged with its rival Kuaidi Dache and was renamed Didi Kuaidi (later renamed Didi Chuxing or “DiDi”).

In August 2016, DiDi acquired all assets of the Chinese division of *Uber*.

Since the company was founded in 2012, under the leadership of Cheng Wei and Jean Liu, DiDi has grown to become one of the world’s highest valued tech start-ups.

By September 2015, Didi Kuaidi had obtained 80% market share in private car hailing services and 99% of the taxis market share. The same month, Didi Kuaidi announced the launch of a rebrand process, including a plan to rename itself ""Didi Chuxing"".

*2016: Acquisition of Uber China*

By the beginning of 2016, *Uber China*, which started its Chinese operations in 2015, had become a major competitor to Didi Kuaidi. Uber's then-CEO, Travis Kalanick, claimed the company was losing over US$1 billion annually in China.

In June 2016, DiDi closed a US$4.5 billion fundraising round, with investors including Apple Inc., China Life Insurance Co., and a financial affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. As part of the round, DiDi secured a $2.5 billion syndicated loan arranged by China Merchants Bank Co. This equity share fundraising round is one of the world's largest by any private company, surpassing the previous record set by DiDi.

On 1 August 2016, DiDi announced that it would acquire Uber China in an acquisition valuing Uber China at US$35 billion. As part of the deal, Uber acquired 5.89% of the combined Chinese company with preferred equity interest which at the time equated to a 17.7% economic interest in DiDi. The transaction also provided DiDi with a minority equity interest in Uber.

In April 2019, *Uber* released a public version of its S-1 filing ahead of its planned initial public offering. As part of the filing, Uber revealed that at the time of filing, the company owned a 15.4% stake in DiDi. Uber's stake in the company was diluted (from 17.7% in 2016 to the 2019 stake) as a result of new investments from additional investors since 2016.

* 2017–present: business expansion, crisis and safety system enhancement

In March 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that *SoftBank Group Corporation* approached DiDi with an offer to invest $6 billion in the company to fund the ride-hailing firm's expansion in self-driving car technologies, with a significant portion of the money to come from SoftBank's then-planned $100 billion Vision Fund.

On 28 April 2017, DiDi announced it closed a new financing round of over US$5.5 billion to support its global expansion strategy and continued investments in AI-based technologies. The round valued the company at US$50 billion.

In December 2017, *Reuters* reported that DiDi had raised $4 billion for a global push into foreign markets and investments into technologies such as Artificial Intelligence.

In May 2018 the company received a wave of negative media coverage when a female passenger on the company's Hitch social carpooling service was murdered by her driver. In August of the same year, a second female passenger was raped and killed by her driver using the same Hitch service on the DiDi platform. Following these incidents, DiDi suspended its Hitch services in August 2018, and began to reform its platform with improved safety standards. In September 2018, Didi announced an investment of $20 million in customer service, The app's safety updates included an evolving set of safety precautions and in-app functions, including the formation of an in-app safety center, en-route audio recording, police assistance button and blocking function to restrict service from certain drivers and passengers. The company also invested $20 million in its customer service offerings and increased its in-house customer service team to 8,000 staff. As part of the update, DiDi created an online discussion platform to facilitate online and offline national public opinion surveys in China. Media reported that in 2018, DiDi recorded losses of up to $1.61 billion owing to heavy spend on training and recruitment of qualified and skilled drivers.

In 2018, the company launched its ""Red Flag Steering Wheel"" program in which verified Communist Party of China members would be visible as drivers. The company also pledged to hire 1,000 Communist Party members as part of its safety drive.

In 2018, the company launched a bike and e-bike sharing platform and expanded vertically into auto service sector with the spinoff of Xiaoju Automobile Solutions, a platform providing auto sales, leasing, financing, car maintenance, refueling and recharging services to driver partners on the platform and independent vehicle owners.

* Since 2015, DiDi has invested in Grab, Lyft, Ola, Uber, 99, Bolt (Taxify) and Careem, and expanded into Latin America, Australia and Japan. In January 2018, DiDi acquired 99, a Brazilian ride hailing app.

* Services: 

DiDi serves 550 million users across over 400 cities with products including Taxi, Express, Premier, Luxe, Bus, Designated Driving, Enterprise Solutions, Bike Sharing, E-bike Sharing, Car Rental and sharing, and food delivery.

*Technology: 

-Artificial Intelligence (AI) : The DiDi Research Institute is focused on AI technologies including machine learning and computer vision to optimize the platform's dispatch system and route planning services. A few hundred scientists work on deep-learning technologies at the institute. To expand on this research, DiDi launched AI Labs in Beijing and in 2018 the company opened DiDi Labs in Mountain View, California. This facility mainly focuses on AI-based security and intelligent driving technologies.

-Big Data Operation : Big data operation: DiDi is building a cloud platform to integrate anonymized data from sensors on vehicles, static information and real-time events from roads with anonymized platform data including pick-up and drop-off, trips and carrying capacity information.

And connecting the dots looking back, with *Apple Car* plans possibly including a robo-taxi service, the company may have been able to learn a lot of valuable knowledge from its involvement with Didi over the last six years that it could leverage in a future ride service.

2021-04-10 20:07:59,wallstreetbets,Company is Chinese so for that reason I am out. Good luck you to OP if you plan to trust China.
2021-04-10 22:52:44,wallstreetbets,Wicked! Nice piece. Thank you.
2021-04-10 22:30:15,wallstreetbets,Can’t wait for the stock market to crash and these inflated valuations to take a huge haircut
2021-04-10 21:43:17,wallstreetbets,"Dude. No one, absolutely no one should trust a Chinese company. Lucky Coffee is already the obvious example."
2021-04-10 23:04:11,wallstreetbets,"Number of issues.

1. How are they planning to pay dividends? Any one dealing in China knows that it is very very hard to get currency out of China.

2. Chinese valuation. And no, not accounting issue. Latest example. There was chinese Rlx e cigarrette something going public this january. It was valued 45 B as if it was 1/3 of Phillip Morris, revenue for rlx was 280 million dollars (70billion for Phillip Morris) so overvalued by 200-300  times. This Rlx is worth 15b now, just 2.5 month later.

3. Chinese government. They are not exactly predictable, jack Ma had Ant Ipo cancelled 3 days before it was scheduled to go in Hong Kong, because he was a bit critical. Majority of business is in China  so assume company gets in trouble with cpc there, then you are screwed.

4. It is a taxi company, just named fancier. Taxi at price of 100B?! How many rides should be taken a year to have reasonable dividend yeild??

5. Company operates mostly in China, China has stock exchange, population likes investing on exchange, has money, company does not operate in Usa but goes public in New York, where no one knows shit about it. Why??

6. China-Usa tensions. Us that predictable and stable, are you certain about its stability?

These are besides Lucky Coffee and tonnes of other scandals as they appear everywhere, but in Usa you can sue Enron and get money for your shares (shocking, but that occurred), how are you going to sue anyone in China.

Disclaimer, not to be considered ethnocritical (fancy way for racist). I am not American, nor am i Chinese, just dont like the stock"
2021-04-10 22:10:57,wallstreetbets,"So tired of all the xenophobia.  Remember the US had some gems like Enron too.  Just wait until the smoke clears on some of these SPACs, I think a few more polished turds will show up.

That being said, I love due diligence that includes nothing about financials.  Probably another cash burning machine, otherwise, why IPO?   Too many zombie tech companies these days that don't make money.  If their market share is excessive, they will get regulated and it will be tough to turn on the profit switch.   Drives me crazy that companies are getting valuations based on revenue projections, is this 1999 again?"

2021-04-11 15:12:47,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you HOWEVER this may be promising being that they have almost the entire Chinese rideshare market (which is literally 18+% of the world population) and are expanding other countries as well as their entrance into e-bikeshare AND their investments in Uber.

Keep in mind UBER is currently sitting at a $107B Market Cap.

I will be waiting for a balance sheet.

this is such a stupid ass retarded point. Obviously because the US capital market is way bigger than the shenzhen/shanghai/hk exchange. Easier to raise equity abroad. Jumia operates in the Africa continent, you mean to say it shouldnt list in the US?"
2021-04-10 23:16:51,wallstreetbets,"Reading your post I realized that you haven’t read anything what is in there and of course respect your point of view.

Also there is a political involvement against China, and boycotting, April 14th Senate is talking about the Tech and its competitors (China in general).

Its not an issue to get 10 billion in cash in China, so bigger market is not applicable (100 billion Ipo means 10b if 10% are initially offered)"
2021-04-11 02:02:23,wallstreetbets,"I will put it shorter if you would like, do you see the company getting to 150b after 3 weeks (because if it would be listed in Hk, all stocks there go up first week, but than go down) and not to 30b in three months?
 Valuation is too high considering other issues discussed. 35b would be okayish, if there are profits (not two unknown people saying they are) of 1b using P/e it should be 35b (microsoft 's  is p/e38) uber being 110b is not a reference (ironially company never ever was profitable)"
2021-04-11 01:37:52,wallstreetbets,"I respect you respecting me, but I have read the article.

As far as i am concerned it is mostly a taxi company in China. Here is why. Latin America and Russia are not places where taxi company like Didi can generate income so value part of that is close to zero. New zealand is way to small, but it is something, Japan is tricky as there is a bit of unhappiness between two countries, so all things outside China are not anything special to the price. I am only considering China business of taxi (delivery, food deluvery, limo, bike et cetera, just to be short)

Research labs are not something that generates money on the contrary they take cash and may not deliver anything in return. Self driving I believe is not worth anything in Didi for now, as Tesla is working on it in Ilons way, while rest think of Lidar to be the path to autonimous driving and Chinese company would not get that technology from Usa (long story, but Mvis might get the technology and company is involved in a military deal of Microsoft for 22b, so can explain this part if important). 
In any case, there is no technology yet, but money are spent.

Uber investing in Didi, well Uber wasted 1 billion in China and got away getting some deal like that in exchange for whatever. So i am accepting this part, but to a degree.

Softbank... well, it would not be a financial scandal if there is no softbank or credit swiss saying goes.
Remind me how Softbank and WeWork went? Softbank putting 45billion- 87billion dollar valuation. Other softbank screw ups i can provide as well. Honestly, now i am sceptical of anything that Softbank touches.

Btw, both Uber and WeWork never posted profits, not even now, but with this Didi we are not even told.

Now to my points.
1 Tensions you do agree, I assume.

2 Considering dual listing does not mean doing it. So why the listing occurs in USA where practically nothing of business exists and how money in form of dividends would be paid to outside of China. (Lets agree that majority of profits (if any ***) comes from taxi thing in China)

3 Communist Party thing, today its nice, tomorrow its not (i provided example of Jack Ma who got punished in China, or can provide example of Huawei and 5g how its communist army/party connection got the company punished in Usa)

4. Something goes wrong, how can i sue anyone, nothing is here (1 or 2% out of 100b evaluation is not in China, so nothing)

5. I suppose underwritting done by Goldman somewhat prevents possible accounting shinanigans, so that part i would waive (though not really, because someone allowed lucky coffee and alike, and Goldman did really, really well on the accounting with Malaysia fund:))

 You have done a good article, but the questions I have are bothering me and i have not found the answers to ease my concerns.

***"" That translated to a net profit from its core ride-hailing business of roughly $1 billion in 2020, according to two people with knowledge of its finances, the first time the business made a significant amount of money on a full-year basis since 2017.""
 Quote from what forbes used as sources. So two people said its so and it was copy-pasted. A bit unreliable.

Also if there is 1 billion of profit, why 100b valuation? 15-35b tops p/e of 100 is a bit too much. Microsoft has p/e of 38, with proven record. While this company is being Ipoed so there shall be discount."
2021-04-11 01:25:26,wallstreetbets,Will wait for financials to make definitive conclusions.
2021-04-11 04:26:22,wallstreetbets,"Also true but these are literally apps making no profit, except for the insiders. Look at the Deliveroo IPO for example recently."
2021-04-11 06:02:18,wallstreetbets,"Well obviously, that goes without saying."

2021-04-11 03:01:32,wallstreetbets,"Understand points from your perspective and it has to be (otherwise we would run into things like chickens), I always respect other points of views as we are only “contribute” to each other in a way, (still thinking that we can’t even compare uber with them)

As I always look on a much broader perspective, and look at inovation, vision and technology (what are they doing and what can they do) that they are getting involved with, they are looking for a global exposure over ride-hailing or how you called fancy taxi (almost same as uber), also most of their research goes into building a leading robo-taxi competitor, as they are good at it and started pretty early, for me spreading globally is only a plus since there is only an Uber that can compete with, and they are losing and lost Asia, also it's not their only goal, since they invest in lots of different things that I wrote in article such as AI, and cloud platform etc., they do have their own research facilities here in Cali and newest in Toronto, since that can only better them in a way that they are actually investing in themselves (look in the future), its their own ""eco-system"".

They are going in with their own electric cars and also partnering with BYD (Backed by a Warren Buffet) wouldn't know if would Warren deal with just ""any other company"", for electric Vans and future models and self driving cars.

As I said they also important partnership with NVIDIA also article about it with link.

They are couple years ahead of Uber or even “Tesla” with their plans with robo-taxi adventures, since they started pretty early into research and acting on it.

People don't realize how big they actually are, and numbers that they are doing in every aspect are mind blowing, and yes they are in the profit.

Also Cheng Wei, pretty big head and smart guy that put himself out there.

He beat the “competitors” and moved forward.

As I said I did my DD, and will continue to research into company, its going to be couple of months so we do have time, also looking every aspect, and so far it's giving me a green light ( for now ) since they evolve and will only grow.

Also they own **XA Solutions** which provides a one-stop **auto solutions** platform, XAS handles **services** for registered Didi drivers, such as leasing and purchase financing, insurance, repairs, refueling, car-sharing, and more.

As I said they build their own ""eco-system"" and “living”, operating through it.

Which it saves them lot of money in a long run.

Lots of DD from my side and more to come! :)

Hope that I draw a picture of my vision for the company so far, having a Warren Buffet on the side drinking his coke its not that bad after all. [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/01/buffett-owns-more-of-chinese-electric-car-maker-byd-than-general-motors.html)

Also forgot to mention Tom Cook and Apple’s involvement with their stake in DiDi. [Tim Cook.](https://9to5mac.com/2017/04/20/apple-didi-chuxing-vision/?_gl=1*ze1cbe*_ga*YW1wLWEzUVU5YzBhRmxveFVaSmRFRkI2bWdhZkJmdHk3RjN5akhtNG9rdkROX1ZRaW05bWoxdTh5bGxkOUlOZHNyUFk.)

2021-04-11 10:16:10,wallstreetbets,"China is heavily invested in other transpo companies and they operate in Europe or Latin America, with a management that is European. And they have more market share than Uber. So if your argument is that ride hailing companies will not generate any money in Europe, Russia or Latin America then ok, that's your opinion but not really based on anything."
2021-04-11 12:40:41,wallstreetbets,"China government backs the DiDi, they are private company since the company was founded, now they are exploring dual listing in Hong Kong and US.

Also China’s Central Bank is partnering with DiDi to test its digital currency."
2021-04-11 13:16:29,wallstreetbets," I have heard a lot of technologies being developed soon.
 Robotaxi would not work in a lot of places, actually its easier to say where it could work. China, Us, top5 europe, Japan, in the rest of the world no. That is my belief and if you would like i can explain why, but it has to do with roads and driving.

Self driving robotic cars are further away than couple of years (i suppose with can both agree on that), so investment in Didi has to be long term.

Buffet  invested in Byd and Byd works with Didi, but it does not mean that Buffet believes in Didi. However, technologically Didi can get a the right partners, because all of them exist in China.

Cheng Wei and his accomplishments in the media may be there, but investing in company on Ceo... i bet Aig or Lehman brothers did not have a ceo with bad publicity:)) anyway, lets leave ceo part. In any case I do not know Cheng wei, or anything about him.


I appretiate the argument, but have concerns stated by me with me. I suppose i should have added that there would be tonnes of positives about the company, but can anyone ease my concerns. The concerns i placed in my original message."
2021-04-11 12:56:56,wallstreetbets," Didi would not generate any meaningful money in Russia via taxi or anything. Simply impossible in Russia. Have you ever been in Russia? Sort of like betting on sending beef to India or pork to Saudi Arabia:)


Latin America is not a place where average cost of taxi is high, (not even talking about possibility of robotic taxis there). So i would not expect a lot, with internet not being superbly available. Where in Cuba or Venezuela are they going to make anything? Apply countries and see the scale that can be implemented in the rest, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil would have parts of few cities i agree. Rest of countries are not big enough of a market.

No one said anything about Europe"
2021-04-11 13:26:34,wallstreetbets,"China government is not exactly predictable and them getting involved only complicate things for me. (Jack Ma in China, huawei and 5g in Usa are two latest examples of things involving chinese government).

In any case, why such a high valuation. As i said Microsoft has P/e 38. This one if profit actually exists ( two sources not being anonymous) and is actually 1 b asks p/e at 100. Why would that be?

Both tech, Microsoft way less risky, none of China issues, better priced. Just explain this part. Please."

Without a China backing company wouldn’t be here where it is.

2021-04-11 14:27:00,wallstreetbets,"Getting numbers out of private company is difficult my friend, DiDi president said that the business is profitable, and I don’t doubt it since Didi claims to have 90% of the Chinese ride-hailing market and over 600 million users. 

As I said valuation is mostly bases on their “empire” and getting involved in robo-taxi. (and we know that p/e ratio doesn’t work anymore even Elon said the same thing)

So in the end its mostly just a taxi company in China right now:))) just like i called it in the very first message of mine.

Robotaxi technology is years away from implemented imo, but this argument neither of us can valuate with certainty.

Because you wanted to see the reasoning behind valuation, just like me, that means that its not available for us yet. Considering that all reasons for investment are provided, this one should have been available to see as well. Lets be honest, its the most important.
 Everyone usually says good things, but finding negatives is important, i am sceptical because more often than not things are not delivered. Like EV market, there was Ilon, he delivered, but than there was Ride, Nikola who did not. Such events make me sceptical.

In any case, thank you for the responses. I will not invest in Didi for many reasons. I guess i am sceptical:))"

Max Pain is 17, but in my opinion, the MM has a  $15.45 price target for the merger. Retail will sway the call to puts just because we are all YOLO / 420 and they (MM) know it.

Now look at TLRY 4hr chart and you can kinda see where TLRY is priced at for the merger as well. 

Merger was announced DEC 16 and ran for a couple of weeks. That's where the price for the merger is set.

Ignore the big boner-looking spike in the middle. In my opinion that is not going to happen again.

In the last two months, TLRY has consistently met resistance as the merger gets closer. If it declines where I can see the merger price is around 18.52 by 4/16. 

Each share of APHA will be 0.83 of TLRY (18.52 x 0.83) means APHA will be $15.37."

2021-04-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MAXR DD Overview

MAXR or Maxar technologies is a space technology solutions firm. They specialize in satellite imagery, and provide services to NASA and the department of defense including robotics, earth imagery, and geospatial analytics and insight. This company has a long history working with NASA, in 1965 it was known as 'philco-ford', and designed and developed the Houston space center for the gemini and apollo missions. Since helping humans reach the moon for the first time, the firm has gone through a number of acquisitions, and acquired multiple other companies itself. Today MAXR has 4 satellites orbiting earth, which they use for their primary business which is imagery. 60% of their business is satellite imagery services, and 40% is space infrastructure. 

What do they do with their satellites?

MAXR uses satellite imagery to assist the various branches of the military. The company uses satellite imagery to locate mission critical locations of enemy warships, airbases, communications systems, and other physical infrastructure that the military might need to form a tactical plan.  MAXR is a key partner in us army's project TITAN, USDI's MAVEN, and NAVY's project Overmatch. The most exciting (imo) technology MAXR offers involves using geospatial data to identify the locations of individual shooters on the battlefield. Pretty crazy, but the company can use satellites to capture images of the battlefield, and provide imagery to soldiers on the ground that pinpoint locations of enemy footsoldiers. The companies AI can even recommend actions to take against the located individuals. 

In the infrastructure business, MAXR has recently delivered NASA a space bus for mission psyche that will be travelling to a resource rich asteroid between mars and Jupiter. As well as developing robotic arms for nasa's OSAM-1 mission. Whose goal is to service and repair satellites in orbit. (as a vast majority of satellites are non operational). Satellite repair and reconstruction could be a hugely profitable enterprise, as it would save costs on launching.

&#x200B;

Bullish arguments

1. Fundamentals. Fundamentally speaking, MAXR technologies is a very attractively priced company. The firm has generated revenue of 1.7 billion in the trailing 12 months, with a gross profit margin of 730 million, or 42%. Compare that 730 in gm to the companies market cap of 2.76 billion and you realize the firm is very undervalued. 2.7billion$ market cap/730 million annual gm=3.69 market cap/profit. Which is quite low. (to put in context aapl=19, pltr=65, ktos=16, mcd=17, amzn=18, intc=6). This essentially means that if you bought the entire business, you'd make your money back on just the profits in under 4 years. 
2. Extremely difficult industry to enter, so threat of new competitors is very low. 
3. Much of the firms business is with multi year, government contracts. So business is locked down for a while. This could be a downside if the company loses a major contract however. 
4. Highly innovative company in a high growth sector. MAXR is the global leader in satellite imagery, No other company has nearly as many, or as important contracts with nasa and various defense agencies. Even Northrup-Grumman and Boeing aren't even close to MAXR when it comes to earth imagery services and advanced robotics engineering. 
5. Strong record of delivering net income available to common stock holders. (A lot of companies don't do this). 
6. Insider/institutional ownership. The firm is owned 66% by institutions, and recently awarded it's insiders 122,000 shares of stock options.
7. Technical analysis. The company is currently on a dip, after having found resistance around 41$ for months, before the stock offering.

Bearish arguments

1. Debt positions. The company has a large amount of debt. With over 2.5 billion of long term debt.
2. Recent dilution via stock offering. The company recently financed their debt by selling 400m of stock.
3. shrinking receivables. Accounts receivable are lower this year than any time in the past few years.

2021-04-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PSFE: An undervalued play with relatively low risk and high upside potential &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h0hmwro2tds61.jpg?width=980&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5a271834a7f7e708b95da87853cb3d9f3bec52b

I am currently holding 384 shares of Paysafe at a cost basis of around $14.25 and plan to add more to my position under the $14 price point. I generally look for plays that have relatively low downside risk while also offering high potential returns. My current plan is to hold the majority of my PSFE shares for at least 2-3 years while the company expands and also to purchase a bit of commons to sell off after the first upswing.

Paysafe's company started in 1996. It offers several payment platforms including Skrill and Neteller which operate in many parts of Europe and is now growing in the US with the rise of online gambling. Much of it's revenue comes from processing fees that customers pay to make transactions with companies like DraftKings, eToro, Coinbase, RentMoola, Twitch, etc.

Paysafe has grown their revenue to 1.5 billion in 2021 with .4 billon of that growth occurring within the past 4 years. As online gambling becomes more widespread in the US and possibly soon in Canada, these revenues could increase substantially. They have a great team of entrepreneurs and seasoned executives from Paypal, Facebook, and Barclays. The team is led by Bill Foley who took the firm public this year via a SPAC and has plans to grow the company over the next several years. He is admired by Wall Street for his successful track record in helping companies to succeed.

PSFE is one of the few SPACS that have held up past the merger and this has happened even in light of the recent overall decline in sentiment in SPACS as a whole. Since the first announcement, it has maintained a steady average of around $14-15 with a low of around $13.50 and a high of around $19.50. There is a very low short volume on PSFE, which at best is bullish and at worst is neutral for this company.

Some possible risks include competing payment solutions and the insider lock up period which may drop later this fall.  In spite of that Paysafe has a great leadership team, a steady revenue stream, and is poised to grow. I could easily see it hitting $22-24 in the short term and $45 by some time next year. IMHO, this is not one to YOLO some calls on. It will require some patience, at least until the first earnings date hits and this stock starts to get some more traction and direction.

Many people dont see that paysafe unique value proposition is that they focus where other players dont, like online gambling and gaming. These are two relative untapped payment niches so far if they execute well. Bill Foley should help.

2021-04-10 20:44:21,wallstreetbets,"The take rate or fees they charge are lower than other fintech companies but they make up for that by cutting expenses elsewhere and lowering their operating costs.  Since they are fresh of the press with their listing and not quite as well known in the US, I think people are sitting on the sidelines to see how it pans out.  

They are still gaining ground too, so some investors may want to see that they can capture a larger share of the market with their product and that other payments systems don’t drown them out.  SPACs as a whole have taken a huge hit, so I think that may have contributed to their current lower multiple trading prices as well."
2021-04-10 21:09:04,wallstreetbets,"So I’ve started a position but reading through their marketing deck again and comparing it to some other growth / fin tech companies, their projected revenue growth is really low. Obviously a big hope is that they come out with good earnings and a revised projection but their deck shows rev growth of 10% a year 2021-2023. That is pretty lousy (PYPL is forecasting 20% this year, SQ 50% after growing 100% lat year)

Also the sentiment around SPACS has turned really negative. And there’s going to be an overhang surrounding the lockup and Blackrock and CVC stakes for a while."

2021-04-11 16:47:50,wallstreetbets,"An option contract is for 100 shares. The price of the option depends on a few things, how close to the strike price the stock currently is, how likely it is that the stock will fluctuate in value etc. You're paying a fee for the right to buy or sell a share at a specific price, regardless of what the price is on the market.

An example, apple is $100 per share, you think it'll go to $140 in 2 months. You buy a call option with the strike of $140 dated for 2 months ahead. The option costs you $200. As the stock price moves up, the option becomes worth more money. You don't need the stock to even hit $140 to make a profit, because you can sell the option itself to someone else for more than you paid for it, if it does go up above $100. The worth will depend again on how close to the strike price and how far away from expiry it is. If the price goes above $140, you can exercise the option anytime up until the expiry, taking delivery of the 100 shares for $140/each. Now if the stock price reached say $160 before the option expires, you've made $20 x 100 shares. So $2000 minus your $200 option cost gives you $1800 profit. Or if you don't have the cash to buy 100 shares, you can just sell the option to someone who can.

If you think the price is going to go down, you buy a put, and make money if the stock does go down, the more it goes down, the more money you make as above.

Options are made by market makers, they sell calls and puts at incremental strike prices every week, and they go from expiring in a week to expiring 2-3 years ahead sometimes."

the n you transfer it from your Revolut normal account to your bank account - > also pretty much instantaneous transfer.

then - once its in your bank account - you pay your taxes. and spend the rest on Hookers and Cocaino"

2021-04-10 20:47:15,wallstreetbets,What do these calls Mean?

2021-04-11 11:11:50,wallstreetbets,I'm long PLTR and over the next 5 years I think the stock will go up 300-600%.  Not too sure about options for demo day though.. didn't PLTR have a demo day earlier this year that didn't move the stock?
2021-04-11 11:19:55,wallstreetbets,All these calls for PLTR posted today makes me wanna risk buying some PUTS on PLTR.

2021-04-10 22:24:29,wallstreetbets,That’s the way they show up on TDA when you sell a call. So if they’re naked then yes infinite risk. But he’s hedged with the long calls. If I’m reading right. Smooth brain etc.
2021-04-10 23:11:13,wallstreetbets,Yes I am short 200 calls which is an equal amount of calls I own. Depending on the strike/expiration it’s either a diagonal vertical or calendar spread. Essentially the short leg helps my calls out with time decay but since it’s at a higher expiration or shorter date the calls I own will increase in value more and peak at $31 on or before expiration
2021-04-11 13:30:38,wallstreetbets,The implied volatility is actually fairly low right now - 60s Ish

Oh buddy....."

2021-04-11 15:58:38,wallstreetbets,I watched it keep dropping nonstop. Had no way to know 20 was the floor.  Many were calling for 15.
2021-04-11 13:45:51,wallstreetbets,"I think he should buy back the -200 and then sell out further far out strike. His long position is fine, but in the quest to lower cost basis, he has always wiped a lot of potential gains. But ofc a good chance that those calls cAnt be squared off without taking a loss. So if i were him, i d just buy some LEAPS."
2021-04-11 16:00:01,wallstreetbets,I mean it's still below 25. You could still average down
2021-04-10 23:22:41,wallstreetbets,"IKR ....Bought some on Friday, buying more on Monday.  Not advice, I just like the stonk!"

2021-04-11 18:41:55,wallstreetbets,"One thing you can consider doing since you own GME stock is sell calls against them. The premiums are quite nice. Just weeklies at whatever price you think the stock won't hit this week.. For example 250, 300 or some other number. If you see a big rise, you can always step out if you believe in rockets...."

2021-04-11 05:58:46,wallstreetbets,What will the catalyst be to 200?
2021-04-11 17:51:55,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Those who know see this as a sweet discount. Jokes on them.

2021-04-11 13:08:02,wallstreetbets,"I've got a small position but this is my question as well. What IS the catalyst to drive it up? I feel that the hedges probably are shorting again but probably not as heavily as before and certainly not without a plan to not get caught with their pants down again. They might be evil but they AREN'T stupid. With all that in mind, what lights the fuse if any squeezes will be less than before?"
2021-04-11 04:22:04,wallstreetbets,Time to buy that dip!
2021-04-10 20:19:27,wallstreetbets,Yes daddy
2021-04-11 06:00:04,wallstreetbets,4 to 480 wasn't the squeeze?
2021-04-11 06:01:24,wallstreetbets,Cause you'd lose a lot of money? It's happening right now whether you want it to or not
2021-04-11 15:22:57,wallstreetbets,"Here's a couple possible catalysts: 
1. When / if a share count happens, and we see exactly how many shares are out, who owns them, and precisely how shorted it is. I don't think there's many new shorts, but I don't think the old ones were ever covered to get them under 100% shorted. Most estimates are well over 100% short.
2. When the insanely high short positions expire / get called in and all the shorts have to cover (more shares than exist)

This is basic stuff you should know if you're holding GME, and there's so much AMAZING DD out there that covers this from so many angles. If no time to read DD, I think it's ok to trust the rest of the community that is eating the DD every meal."
2021-04-11 10:21:28,wallstreetbets,"With institutional ownership at 200%, the shorts havent covered  4 to 480 was ryan cohen and retail buying shares. Ryan cohen until Novemberish when his position had to be publicly disclosed but the ramp up was retail and gamma squeezing"
2021-04-11 10:01:49,wallstreetbets,"I actually don’t want to get out. I want to collect sweet, sweet premiums"
2021-04-11 10:24:54,wallstreetbets,You dont think you asset can go lower than 40 if it were to hit 40? The price is a fugazi its not real. The shorts havent covered at all so it doesnt matter if gme is 40 a share 200 a share or 400 a share its a deal up until the squeeze.
2021-04-10 20:04:22,wallstreetbets,None of this investing is rational. These are risky bets so some people are willing to risk at a lower share cost than others.
2021-04-10 20:15:50,wallstreetbets,It’s hard to even respond to DFV decipher tweets and hedgies

2021-04-11 02:30:59,wallstreetbets,Im down 3k help me u fucking retards :*(
2021-04-10 21:31:26,wallstreetbets,"Bad news boys. The volume has dried up on the buy side because most of us are fully invested/committed to GME (I am in this boat, having loaded up on 745 at 173 the day after RC was named chair). I'd expected it to shoot to 218, maybe 228 - but the Wolf got me, and he got me good.

As you may have seen Kurt Wolf is no longer a director; he represented Hestia and while he was on the board, could not sell Hestia's GME holdings. Hestia is probably liquidating its holdings now, hence the block 1000 sells you can see coming down (if you have Lvl 2 data). This is going to go on for a while - ie, sell volume is increasing, buy volume drying up. This drives the price down for obvious reasons.

That said, capital outflow on Friday wasn't as bad as I thought it might get. It was a net -24.42 million with inflow of 495.9mm and outflow of 520.3mm. Still dropped the price by \~7%.

If other institutionals start rushing for the exits, we may well have a problem. I bloody well hope not, because I have over a hundy at play right now, but we can't rule out the possibility that this could happen. Just keep an eye on that LVL 2 and the big orders coming through in tranches of 1000 shares a time.

My only consolation right now is that I believe GME has a bright future. This has given me the confidence to swing trade the stock over the past two or 3 weeks, making a sufficient gain to more than offset my current -12k position so far, and enough to soak up another maybe 7 percent decline. After that, I'll be in for the long hold. But if it pops above 200 at any point, I'll grab another exit, then look for another re-entry on the way down.

Good luck everyone! Let's hope for a DFV catalyst on the 15th, he should pop an update soon esp as his call expires on the 16th I think. If he shows he's holding, as I expect he will, I do think the price will pop again."

2021-04-10 22:28:27,wallstreetbets,"Well if you were smart on PLTR or RKT or UWMC, then yeah you would make money. I bought calls on RKT for 0.65 per. Sold them for 13.00 per then next day. Turned $260 into $5200 in 24 hours.  No one was preaching to buy PLTR when it was peaking. Most were saying to buy it before and dump it once it hit 30+. Also, PLTR at its current price IS a good play.

&#x200B;

So, idk what your point was cause all of those were good plays at the time that they were being spread around here. I made loads of profit on them. Also, like I said above. A lot of people have been very bullish on SPY for the last two weeks. If you listened 2 weeks ago and put about $1k into calls, it would be worth around $10k two weeks later. I've made decent side money with call credit spreads on UWMC on it's way down and I'm bringing in about $100 a week writing 7.5 strike csp on UWMC now that it seems to have sat fairly stable at the bottom. 

&#x200B;

The amount of delusion is absurd if you get offended by me saying to play other good plays on the market while GME trades sideways for now. Missing out on a lot of opportunities to make some gains until GME decides to do it's thing."

2021-04-10 21:29:54,wallstreetbets,"Right cuz everyone who disagrees with your predictive logic must be involved in a conspiracy. Lol

I'm in this group because I want to make money and I want to see everybody in this group make money. Up until now I've only been able to read and not post, and in that time I have read a lot.

I have also spent weeks researching GameStop stock and, like everyone else trying to figure out where it will go next.

I'm certainly not here to have a war with the hedge funds. 

The reality is what the people in this group pulled off was absolutely brilliant, but now what I see are people who are being convinced that what has happened in the past is going to happen again and it simply isn't going to.

Will the price of this stock shoot up again? Very likely, but if you are predicating your decisions on the thought that there is going to be another short squeeze on the hedge funds then you are completely disoriented from reality.

The hedge funds have been buying back into their short positions since this price was at the top and again, the last FINRA report shows that the short interest on this stock simply isn't large enough and the individual positions are not over leveraged enough to cause another lasting short squeeze. 

Again all data indicates that the time for the hedge funds to exit their positions would take around 2 hours, at most a half a day. And the hedges will be exiting with profits in hand.

if this stock bounced on opening Monday it would likely bounce to between 170 and 180 and begin falling again by the end of the day.

find better logic instead of trying to demonize someone who questions your analysis. Everyone who doesn't agree with your opinion is not the boogeyman."

I mean all I had to do was pay attention to the DD and RKT sentiment and it lead to me 20x my investment in 24 hours... so I would say it was free money if you listened. Also, for good plays recently look no further than ASO (DD posted over a month ago, but buried under the GME stuff), TSLA under 600, FUBO, AAPL, CRM at the dip, SPY bull run last two weeks (and the correction that is due to come), etc. And all those are just in the last 3-4 weeks. Trust me, if you search through all the memes and shit there is some good DD to give you a starting point for you own research.

>DUDE EVERYONE was preaching nonstop about the weed stocks at all time highs, and PLTR at near while it was at 31, and 28 was ""buying the dip"".  GME holders care about GME, not betting on index funds.

Nah, it was similar to GME. A few people that knew what they were talking about were preaching the weed stocks and PLTR before the highs. Once the high hit, everyone FOMO'd in, which is when you started seeing it everywhere. Which made it seem like it was only getting talked about once the high hit.

&#x200B;

I really don't know why you're being so stubborn. I'm not saying sell your GME. I'm saying free up like 10-20% of your portfolio at least and play the market.

2021-04-11 04:31:29,wallstreetbets,"Here. I'll counter your arguments.

1. Gamestop did take advantage by announcing last week that they will sell up to 1B in stock at market price to fund the turnaround efforts and enhance their balance sheet. Did you expect them to announce a share offering at $483? They obviously waited for the share price to stabilize to announce the offering.

2. The only reason why cyclical stocks have been struggling as of late is because they have rallied substantially since November and now that earnings season is coming up investors want to hear about future projections before going deeper into cyclical stocks. Banks, retail, energy are either at pre-pandemic levels or higher. Cruises are the only stocks that have not fully recovered. Earnings start this week and banks will report knock your socks off numbers which will jump start cyclical stocks so going short now is just dumb.

3. You are assuming that the squeeze has already happened and you may be correct but ask yourself this...

Why is the media so busy spreading fud if its all over? 
How did Melvin lose 7% in March after being up 21% in February? 
How do you explain the large disparities in reported short interest numbers? 
These hedgies are cocky as hell and there's no way they threw in the towel that quickly. 

4. I love the way you are trying to dissect the psychology of apes. There's literally thousands of apes on here (including myself) that don't give a fuck if Gamestop goes back to five dollars. RC took a brand spanking new pet food company to 40B market cap in a very short amount of time. I'm sure he heard a million times how Amazon was going to crush him but he innovated and created a great company and proved them all wrong. He now takes over a company that's been around for almost 40 years. They already have a customer base, vendor relationships, employees, infrastructure etc.
Bet against Ryan Cohen at your peril....

5. I can't argue this point but then again every freaking stock right now is overvalued. Gamestop's numbers have been improving even though a ton of stores were closed, e-commerce sales are up, management has been shaken up etc so there's a argument to be made that this company is not that overpriced.

Mods, give this ape a chance at redemption!

Do they have some moat that will help supercharge their success? Ryan Cohen built a physical goods business, this is a digital goods business. They may be different enough to ever replicate that success."

2021-04-11 08:06:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, Gamestop made an offering.  They're going to inflate the fucking float by 10%.

If you're holding onto GME at prices over DFV (whose price average is like $26 before exercise, back below $20 after exercise) them you're basically willing to give GME am infinite term loan at zero percent interest to rebuild the company.

Not that any of this matters because there has been no liquidity problems in GME since January.  Plenty of shares out there to buy, which is why the ~~apes~~ dumbasses here never have problems buying shares."

Unless someone else has a competitive battery (the 4680 cells Tesla will be making/using is very different and I suspect will be better for cars, definitely in terms of price per kWh, but for everyone else, Quantumscape will likely be their best hope of getting a battery that allows you to compete with Tesla to some extent)  to what QS will make they will be able to expand very fast and should be very profitable. If (and there is real risk here in getting to commercialization can be a massive challenge) QS is successful I think we are easily looking at a company that can be worth 10X what it is now within the decade.

Frankly, right now, regardless of whether the price doubles or halves, I could not see myself selling my QS shares. For the matter, I am long Tesla (by a lot more) as well. I think both companies will do fantastically. I am not long VW, which hopes to use QS's cells as I ultimately think the SS cells will end up going towards applications where you can't really make batteries structural and you need lots of power to weight."

2021-04-11 17:22:49,wallstreetbets,"where does it say they're doing an offering?

in their 10k it says they're extending a currently open ability to sell shares to raise capital, just upping their valuation.

They also stated they have 2x in cash of their current debt, and have no need to actually offer shares at the current time.

did you even READ the 10k? or are you just listening to the bullshit that MSM has been posting in bullshit articles?

now here's the billion dollar question; why the fuck would the company sell shares now, when they'll only get HALF of what they're saying they're trying to raise? They are 100% capped at 3.5 million shares, not one more.

There is absolutely a 0% chance of them selling a new offering at the current time because:

a) they don't need the cash, as was shown by their 10k filing
b) they're already significantly reducing their debt every quarter to the point where their EPS will go positive without an increase in sales
c) they won't get anywhere close to the amount they want to raise until they're selling stock at a minimum of $285/share

perhaps you should do some actual reading about it....

If they lost all of it before the bailout, then they only lost $10.43bn of *profit*. If they lost at least $2.75bn more after they received the bailout, then they lost $10.43bn *profit* AND $2.75bn cash (because they would have used that bailout money first before digging into their assets).

EDIT: For those that ask, that bailout money doesn't get added to their profit in reports.

EDIT 2: For the sake of knowledge, this unfortunately means that Citadel is getting money back in the long term.

2021-04-10 23:21:00,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-10 23:26:59,wallstreetbets,"No sir.

1) [The Reuters source](https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2A00KW) says that it started with $12.5b and ended Jan with more than $8b.


So this 49% loss means from $12.5b becomes $12.5b * (1 - 0.49) = $6.375b


Disclaimer: ASSUMING ALL MSM articles are NOT FUD, and they didn't lie on MSM.*



2) Your $1.507bn long profit ASSUMES that he didn't paper-hand his long positions. We won't know if he did exited some of WORST long positions like AMD, IAA, PLAN & COUP (All upwards of 10% paper loss based on 31 Mar), and whether did he exited in a worse price than listed.


So he could have profited more or less than $1.507bn because this is Q4 2020 filings, NOT Q1 2021 filings which they are reporting in 45 days time.




But however, assuming he NEVER paperhand among his worst or best long positions, and the $1.507bn (paper) profit in long theory stays, it means that his short losses over the 1st 3 months is:

($12.5b * 0.49) + $1.507bn = $7.632b


Oh dear, did anyone reminded me about $2.75b infusion from Citadel and Point 72?


In some other posts, I did said that:

1 Jan: $12.5b
AFTER 53% loss (Assume the price he paid to close ALL short / put positions): $5.875b
Friend boost: $5.875b + $2.75b = $8.625b

May be more, maybe less as his other tickers may have yield him net profit or loss.

Since they say they have more than $8b in end Jan:

31 Jan: $8.01b+, likely $8.625b
28 Feb: Gain 22%

EITHER $5.875b (Without Friend) * 1.22 = $7.1675bn OR $8.01b+ (With $2.75b friend) * 1.22 = $9.7722b+


Mar 31: Down 7%, so EITHER $7.1675bn * 0.93 = $6.66bn OR $9.088bn+


Obviously I believe the $6.66bn made sense with Melvin's 49% losses over a quarter since it is ONLY about $285m differences which is explained by ""Hundreds of millions are coming in as his clients trust his abilities"" (Buy the fucking dip)

Which means:
1) Melvin made LOSSES, not gain in Feb. From $8.625b down to $7.1675b = $1.4575b

Even if it is $8.01b down to $7.1675b = $0.8425b

Upwards of 842million losses in Feb ALONE......

Give me 0.5% of it and it is 4mil - More than enough for me to buy a cheapest lambo model and a condo in Singapore and 5% of it might just barely enough for me to buy a [GCB (Good Class Bungalow) in Singapore](https://blog.seedly.sg/good-class-bungalow-gcb-costs-singapore/)



TLDR:

BEFORE factoring $2.75b infusion and abt $285m infusion from other clients
($12.5b * 0.49) + $1.507bn = $7.632b

AFTER factoring these
$7.632b + $0.285b + ($2.75b - upwards of $0.842m losses in FEB alone) = $8.759b LOSSES over 3 months


So we are seeing SHORTS ALONE bringing $8.759 / $12.5b = 70.07% LOSSES that is covered up by buy the fucking dip + overall paper profits in LONG positions.

If he's up 7% from 19 to 22, that means he gained 3B on longs and the fund still went down 49%, meaning he's got just a little more than half of what he started with. Therefore, 19+3=51%, therefore, his losses are closer to 22*(49/51)=

2021-04-11 02:12:48,wallstreetbets,"The power to fabricate one share more than what the company authorized, opens the door to fabricate unlimited shares in the Billions on a regular basis to achieve their set goals. Market Makers that generate fabricated shares has the goal to swell their finances daily and to achieve it:

1, Fabricate shares to sell the demand as much as buyers are willing to pay.

2. As long as investors are holding and not selling, those fabricated shares out of thin air causes no risk to those produced and sold them.

3. As long as more fabricated shares continue to be generated and sold, Market Manipulators are resting comfortably and getting richer.

4. As long as investors sell their Fabricated and genuine shares to other investors, Market Manipulators are unaffected by the price increase or decrease as they are not the one paying, rather continue to profit by the difference in bid and ask price.

As long as the price increase and market Manipulators can sell new fabricated shares, they continue to profit.

The only way Market Manipulators who sold Fabricated Shares lose, is by legally force them to buy and destroy the Fabricated shares at any cost while prohibiting their ability to fabricate new shares.

Therefore, we can not just buy and hold as long as Market Manipulators fabricate shares to sell. We have to go political and legal and get the authority to stop taking donations from the manipulators and force the elimination of every fabricated share while jailing those Wolf Street Manipulators and their assistants and enablers such as: their bashers, their so-called “analysts” and TV social media and TV embedded assistants.

In this timeline, Gabe could restrict withdrawals from Melvin because he is actually engaged in the fraudulent activity. Additionally, he can’t secure a net long position due to the scale of the hole he is in. If his investors bail, and if indeed he hasn’t covered, then Gabe can’t pay the premiums.

You're missing the point. Underperformance doesn't even factor into the equation.

If you are rich enough that you are investing in hedge funds, you also have too much money to plough into SPY, QQQ or whatever. To get a good hedge you need a manager that is doing something different to buying puts on SPY. Nobody invests 100% of their net worth into 1 hedge fund.

People start to see shortages and so they buy at half supply instead of a quarter supply and demand gets to 18% (although this goes down every day)

Sure the recent Boeing news will be a blow to some, but for the most part international will see big gains. 

From a global perspective TUI is a prime example of an international that will do very well.

2021-04-11 12:22:04,wallstreetbets,"For one hedge funds can invest in instruments which regular people cannot for example credit default swaps around the housing in 2008. Before the crash, it seemed like free money for the big bank sellers, but some hedge funds who bought these made money. 

Another reason is simply good marketing. Hedge funds are run by very smart people so it inspires confidence in investors. Despite the average returns underperforming the s&p, some funds are able to consistently beat it but usually those funds charge higher fees and not just anyone can invest in them. 

As for their track records with hedging, the risk adjusted return of some funds are better than the s&p, so some strategies definitely do work. But again the issue is trying to pick out and getting your money into those extraordinary funds."

I think that, for most people, and for most policy-makers, the hold outs are going to be little more than an annoyance once everyone else is vaccinated.  After all, the vast, vast majority of people they jeopardize will be themselves."

Use google trends and search holidays in the Uk, look at the spikes when restrictions have been eased, it shows the very high levels of built up demand. 

Sure they will take time till vau resumes, but stocks and shares aren’t always about bau, particularly if there is a huge demand, limited competition and profits.

2021-04-11 10:55:18,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations on your gain.

On the math, assuming a market maker sold you the call, the delta would have been around 0.35 on the contracts. The market maker would have had to buy 525 shares at roughly 120/share to stay delta neutral on your position. That's a market value of \~$63k added to GME by Shitadel on top of your $24k position. So Shitadel amplified your play by 2.6:1 to give you that return.

The delta on the option at Friday's close was down to about 0.29, which means Shitadel sold 90 shares of that hedge so far. If we assume they sold around $160 using the mean range of trading since you opened, they sold those 90 shares for a 25% return, or $3600. They should still own about 435 shares just for hedging your contract. Assuming the options expire worthless but above the stock price is above 102 (their break even on a $16 premium against 118) on April 23rd its not a bad run for them either.

There's some gross simplifications in here, like ignoring that delta was briefly \~1 when the price of GME peaked above 200, meaning Shitadel held 1500 shares on this at one point. However it does give an idea of why the gamma squeeze has continued to have an impact through April."

The options themselves are worth money because of the right they give you, so he doesn't even need to want to buy the stocks if the options end up in the money, because certainly someone wants to own the stock for less money than it's worth, so he can sell the option to those people (but he may have the $300k, I don't know why you think he doesn't).

Your math is wrong, someone paying $71k for these options only needs the stock to get to $247.33 to break even.

Why a newb believes only a sucker or idiot would think a highly volitile stock could end up moving above $247.33 is beyond me, but the fact is, someone wants 1,500 options to own the stock at $200, so they bought them."

2021-04-11 15:29:07,wallstreetbets,"If it goes ITM then you can exercise. You’ll just then be required to sell the shares to cover. Making your profit. Also if there is time value left and its ITM you can sell them to someone else willing to hold for longer for more gains. Once ITM its guaranteed to go.

Edit: When its not yet covered and still out of the money, this is when you may have trouble selling depending on what you’re holding. The contracts I had here sold instantly even at multiple times the price I paid only hours earlier because people are expecting a squeeze and when this thing is rocketing up, there are way less people willing to sell contracts. So its demand will become higher than supply during that window raising the value due to number of people trying to buy them. There are other situations where you may be up a thousand percent or more and be holding something no one is willing to buy. GME puts have been this way, if they are set too low to cover."

2021-04-10 22:34:01,wallstreetbets,"""Going up and down"" is different than there being a very real chance that your entire portfolio could lose 80-90% of its value. 

I'm sure you can work to replenish it, but that money is enough to retire on even getting normal rates of return in 30 years. At 10% for 30 years it will be worth $2M. Building back up as you get older will be working against the clock. Check it out for yourself: [https://www.nerdwallet.com/banking/calculator/compound-interest-calculator](https://www.nerdwallet.com/banking/calculator/compound-interest-calculator).

Even if you REALLY believe in GME you can still make a ton of money with 25% exposure, so why risk everything you've worked hard for up until this point?"

2021-04-11 06:09:06,wallstreetbets,This isn’t inflation. This is lack of supply.
2021-04-11 16:52:43,wallstreetbets,I slightly disagree i think the market weakeness before covid was unwarrented before the crash the fed had been steadily raising rates and the expectation that int rates would go well above 3% was starting to take hold. But now i think covid unlocked another decade of low interest rates.  You gotta remember when buffet said stocks were cheap as fuck if interest rates held at 3% right before the covid crash right? Well right now it is pretty clear that we are not going past 3% for the next decade.  Thats all this is and every one w half a brain knows it and thats why u saw ppl piling into equities. It really is that simple.

2021-04-10 22:43:17,wallstreetbets,You’re missing the main point. The money the government is printing is putting pressure on the supply. We are seeing a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money. That’s the definition of inflation.

2021-04-11 12:39:49,wallstreetbets,">your overwhelming lack of context and ignoring short term AOG in the suez not being conveyed

your words. you are thinking that the suez is a contributor to the spike when prices were already high. A one week delay isn't that big of a deal in disruption.

 The US gas shortage this fall had a bigger impact to prices than anything. It caused the ppi to increase by 40% and was the cause for most of marches price increase. 

There are still suppliers conducting repair work.  

mind you that was a shit fest to deal with and caused more of an issue than the suez thing did."
2021-04-11 15:49:50,wallstreetbets,"u/ahminus - Just out of curiosity, is that why so many people were freaking out recently when the 10yr price rose above 1.7?

Were they worried that people would want to start buying bonds as opposed to shorting them, which would mean that anyone who borrowed treasuries to short and then who sold those borrowed treasuries to another buyer would be in deep shit?

The people who the shorts borrowed the bonds from might want them back, while the people who borrowed the original bond from the shorts won’t want to sell, causing a shitstorm, right?"
2021-04-11 12:29:08,wallstreetbets,"I used to work at Quizno’s and I would be the first one there to open the store. My roommate was the 2nd guy in. One day I was just fucking fed up with life and I’m in the bathroom cleaning it and just lean against the sink with my hands staring into the mirror blankly wishing I were dead or invisible or anywhere but there. My roomy opens the door and just laughs out loud and says ‘holy shit bad day already?’

We joked about him intruding on my early-life crisis for years. To be honest though, there’s been lots of those moments in my life and I know I’m not alone. Working at the bottom and understanding that’s your lot in life is a tough pill to swallow. Even now I feel I have a decent existence. I own a home (well the bank does), I have multiple vehicles, some entertainment stuff.. it’s a comfortable life. 

Then I look at these billionaires who profit off of killing the competition. Robbing the working class blind and tossing them scraps. These people have so much wealth it makes my moderately successful life look destitute in comparison. It’s not right. 

These sickeningly rich bastards haven’t spent most their lives looking in that mirror wondering if being alive is even worth the struggle. We might share the same planet, but they’re in a whole different world. All I want out of this is to not work my body into the ground for a corporation who couldn’t give a shit about it’s employees because we’re all just numbers to them. I want to be able to provide for my kids and even my friends. I don’t even feel sorry for myself, just where I’ve been. I know there’s lots of people doing way worse than myself, they deserve better. When this pays off I’m going to share my wealth. That’s what sets us apart from these greedy wall street fucks."

2021-04-11 04:46:03,wallstreetbets,"Listen carefully man. It doesn't mean it's a good investment just because the technology is good. You talk a great deal about their innovation, but your valuation is a number just chosen randomly, and it has nothing to do with the actual business. $600 by 2023 would mean, if we assume that the market prices in 15-20 times the earnings, that Moderna can reach $12-16B in net earnings in just two years, and that is a crazy assumption considering that right now even with the massive sales of vaccines in 2020 it can't even turn a profit and it burns hundreds of millions per year instead. Even the biggets players in the pharmaceutical industry struggle to rech those figures consistently, and they don't just sell a single type of advanced vaccine product (which by the way is subject to price control by governments), they are highly diversified and estabilished companies that don't need to dig themselves out of the debt hole.

The market is already pricing in massive growth in MRNA with its current valuation and it's arguably already overvalued. Remember that  the guys who bought AMZN lost 95% of their capital even if it was a great company that went on and changed the world. It took them almost 10 years just to turn a profit. So understand the risk, because you might have crazy returns, but you ARE getting into a rollercoaster. The stock has already 10xed during the past year, you are not the first one who has had this idea lol. You are just a scientist who doesn't know anything about the market.

Investing is not about innovation, it's about cashflow."

2021-04-11 05:39:38,wallstreetbets,"Well they’re in the same field, but they have little (nothing) to show so far. For Covid their vaccine candidate with sanofi got delayed multiple times, they’re far behind in that race imo. Compared to Moderna, Biontech & CureVac they also have far less experience and expertise on board, and they have no real alternative products rn (even in the pipeline afaics). On the flip side, they’re still low-ish whereas MRNA, BNTX & CVAC are all trading high, even near ATH.

My argument would be that nevertheless, BNTX & CVAC (more than MRNA) still have big upwards potential, due to their innovative pipelines (high efficacy influenza vax currently in clinical trials, vaccine printers, etc) and/or upcoming catalysts (covid vaccine trial results for CVAC expected this month, incl virus variants). All that in top of the solid outlook that they’ll likely have a large share in the covid vaccine market for years to come, bc the mRNA technology plus their production capacities positions puts them in an excellent position, assuming we’ll all have to get annual booster shots against new variants in the future."

My point being is Intel will need to move beyond x86 and diversify their design and manufacturing capabilities. I think they could be once again the worlds leading semiconductor manufacturer and designer, and right now they are cheap in terms of P/E in this market."

Then I had a fucking benzo seizure and the sober house kicked me out bc liabilities so I wound up back home at 28. That was 6 years ago. My parents despised me, man. I was down bad.

She bursts out onto the patio. Even though she's older now and a mother she's as beautiful as ever. The panic on her face is concerning and she takes a moment to find words to say.

""Honey I just saw the news. Everyone is panicking about the stock market collapse. I know we have a lot of money in Robinhood. Are we ok?"" She asks with genuine concern. She really isn't involved much with our investments.

""Don't worry we're doing great actually!"" I replied holding back the deepest longing to tell her the truth.

""Ok well please just cash out or play it safe ok?""  She says before going back inside to tend to our offspring.

I took in the peace a moment longer. Beside me I grabbed and sipped my old bourbon drink I'd almost forgotten. The sweet warmth of the alcohol runs down my soul as I finally reach for my phone. Tears streaming down my face now as I see the results of my misbehavior. How will I ever explain this?

I’m looking at all of them and they’ve either slightly went down while paying dividends or flat while paying dividends or have grown significantly over 1-5 years some paying dividends and some not. How do you lose money long term in leveraged etfs? Lol if you have 200 shares and the dividends have them reinvest themselves isn’t it like a savings that multiplies itself by adding dividends to the underlying stock? Sure if it dips you lose profit but it’s only bad if you planned on selling soon. You could just average down and hold some more years and gain a bigger profit overtime when it recovers."

2021-04-10 22:15:54,wallstreetbets,"Alright, let me put it to you this way. If you go to a casino and head to a blackjack table that has $500 minimum bet per hand, would you sit down? If yes, if you were dealt a pair of 8's, would you split? What if you get another pair of 8's, would you split again? Let's top it off where every hand miraculously got 3's giving you natural 11's, would you double down on each hand? That's $4000 on the table in one go. Can you stomach the pain if you lose that all at once?"

2021-04-11 19:24:21,wallstreetbets,"Not my words but it’s like Matt Levine (read his newsletter it’s good) wrote this little thing specifically for this conversation:

“[GME] It was trading in the $40s as recently as February, in the teens as recently as January, in the $4s as recently as August...

Last year GameStop was a declining mall-based video-game retailer in a world in which games are increasingly downloaded directly from online platforms; now GameStop has basically the same business, but a whole new swagger and optimism in the stock market. I guess that latter part is worth $12 billion? I understand nothing.”

Just like he says, I just think the fundamental nature of their business has not changed. I think a realistic price is somewhere around $75 with all the goodwill in the world and all Cohen magic figured in. I’ve been selling puts for months now and made some good premium on my trades so I’m not like, begrudging the rise of GME stock; but there you go, that’s my sort of basic gut feeling explained a bit."
2021-04-10 21:13:01,wallstreetbets,Lmao
2021-04-10 21:01:41,wallstreetbets,My account is basically GME and NEE so its really nice to see DD about the latter.
2021-04-10 22:38:51,wallstreetbets,"I stay up so late on a Friday night (Australia) waiting for these. You sir, are my favourite.

Thank you for the confirmation  bias on NEE - buying more at open. Yeet"
2021-04-11 13:10:49,wallstreetbets,"Late to the party but have a very serious question about the amount of NEE you guys are expecting BlackRock to buy.

You mentioned 400m and 30 days worth of vol which so I assume you mean 400m in shares.  Looking at the BlackRock spreadsheet, it says NEE has a 4% weight in the fund.  If the aforementioned are true... then this means the entire fund will be worth (1 / 0.04) x 400m x $77.94 ~= 780 BILLION, which is crazy given that the current fund net asset is only 5.5 billion.

Also, if we take that number and check how much of other companies will be bought then it becomes even crazier.  Example, ENIA is given a weight of 1.685%.  So BlackRock would have to buy 780b x 0.01685 ~= 13b, which is ENIAs entire market cap....

If this is just a “rebalance” and we dont expect BlackRock to invest much more into the fund, then isn’t 400m shares way too optimistic??? I don’t know how rebalances usually work but let’s say they increase net asset to 10b.  10b x 4% = 2.5b cap.  Divide by 78, and that gives us 32million shares.  If they stick with around 6b asset, then it’ll be about 18million.  

So did I misunderstand or miscalculate something??  I really want to get in on this BlackRock train, but I really want to figure out which stock to ride.  NEE seems like it will be minimally impacted given its huge cap.  Thanks in advance!"
2021-04-10 23:59:20,wallstreetbets,"Stock split was end of October, so... that?"
2021-04-11 16:21:56,wallstreetbets,Can you elaborate on how you figured/calculated its 30 days of BlackRock volume?
2021-04-11 06:29:46,wallstreetbets,"Does that usually spike a stock beyond 300 (302,65 closing high on DEGIRO) before returning to the 70-80 range?"
2021-04-11 08:52:29,wallstreetbets,"It was a 4 to 1 split.  So 300/4 is 75, exactly."
2021-04-11 08:55:56,wallstreetbets,"Yea, but it wasn't 300 before? In the graph I'm seeing it spikes to 300 and back in just days.

It was nice, but I think she got a little self conscience because she got a little vulnerable, so she stopped responding. Also, it’s late, might have fallen asleep.

Anyway she is still very cute and I am still very excited for the date and I’m going to chill on texting her for a while. This has historically been a part where I can fuck up, because I am not the best at walking the line of not talking *too much* before a date or talking *too little* and it’s been over a year so I am rusty as fuck. Regardless, I’m just really excited to get to be in this wobbly wobbly uncertain space of excitement and potential again. It’s such an *alive* feeling.

2021-04-11 03:35:38,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit you’re one of them. 

„Rolling“ isn’t some specific action. It’s just what you call closing one trade and opening another with the same underlying and a later expiration. Some brokers have buttons that do it automatically so it might seem to you as if it’s one thing, but it’s not. 

There is no „credit“ or „debit“. There are realized gains or losses from closing the first trade, and gains from opening the second trade. It’s stupid to call it a credit or debit because you wouldn’t do that if you instead opened a trade with another underlying. But it’s the exact same thing. The two trades have absolutely no connection. 

It’s honestly baffling how many people who deal with this shit don’t have the most fundamental understanding of it."
2021-04-11 12:46:37,wallstreetbets,"No shit rolling is closing a trade and opening another. But you don't have to roll the same strike jackass. You can roll up and out, or down and out.

Go read any book on options. It's commonly referred to as rolling for a debit or credit.

2021-04-11 19:03:51,wallstreetbets,"What a great source, an advertisement aimed at people who have no idea what they’re doing. 

Is the only thing you can do to discredit me pointing out that my quick summary didn’t cover every variation of rolling? Notice how I didn’t even mention a strike because it’s fucking obvious that you can change it - because you’re opening a completely new and independent position after closing another one. 

You‘re so focused on covering every possible variation and direction there is to rolling that you didn’t even get my point: I don’t care how many books you read that call it credit and debit, it’s a stupid convention that’s only confusing people by making it seem like they’re somehow extending or modifying a single trade by rolling it."

Personally I bought a whole new HT setup and am cocked, locked, and loaded but I will 100% still go see Ghostbusters, Top Gun, and other big 1984 reboot releases when covid is finally dead.

Longer term?  I dont know.  But through 2022 I feel pretty good.  You cant go on a vacation super quickly, but you certainly can go to the movies the moment they open."

2021-04-11 04:24:37,wallstreetbets,Ya but then the bonds used to pay the debt also become worth less and less so it becomes a positive feedback cycle and hyperinflation

They retained their best performing stores post WGB sale, they are continuing to grow their PBM, and the vaccine/Fed reimbursements are significant tailwinds for several years.   The pre-earnings announcement was nothing specific to RAD - the entire sector saw lower cold/flu ~ accounting for $0.25/share.  This is already baked in and was not actually that significant given the fake sell off of only ~240k shares.  Not a single executive has sold shares even after the latest run up to $32.   $30-40 is absolutely going to happen very shortly - I believe much higher.  I’m long."

Everything u see on here is confirmation bias, yolos, silly DDs, and a bunch of grabass. And btw, GME is one of the best short term (maybe even long term) plays on here. Squeeze or no squeeze, there’s literally no other stock that’s as popular rn so keep doing u bro"

I set a remindme so I could shit on you for making such a retarded proclamation , and you did make just that. I legit, they will def print proclamation. 

Not everything on here is bullshit. Over the years there have been legit countless DDs and info that was ahead of everything. Plenty of good shit on here, but not since you normies invaded.

Most popular with who exactly? Just considering this sub went from 2 mil to 8 mil in a few weeks its only popular with the 6 million( most likely you considering post history) newbie gme tards that can't accept that the squeeze happened. It's over and you're now just long on it. 

I made plenty of cheese off gme. Then I've been crushing it with itm spy leaps recently. Easy money 

I don't get so emotionally attached into stonks where I call saying things will def print( except spy calls because duhhh they always do)

But you don't have the intelligence to even comprehend anything considering of how deep down the rabbit hole you are"
2021-04-10 23:20:03,wallstreetbets,"It’s right there for you, I suggest looking through. I don’t know if your being purposefully obtuse or are genuinely slow, but the dudes post literally stated: “GUYS PLEASE GIVE ME SOME CONFIRMATION BIAS...” that’s exactly what everyone was doing, but noooooooo, you went and bought calls and got burned. 

Like I said, I don’t care if GME squeezes or not. There are lots of good things on the horizon for the company, and I think the volatility is perfect for casino players. The true value of the stock is irrelevant at this moment—stock is constantly on the news, and there’s so many potential catalysts that we will certainly see 200+. It’s a meme stock, but there’s big smart money playing it as well. If you think it’s all over than that’s you prerogative. Idc 99% of content on here is bs, but it’s one of the most entertaining subreddits out there. Ppl like you simply cannot distinguish between fucking around and being serious, but i couldn’t care less.

And lol about your comment on intelligence...dude you sound like a simpleton thinking he’s so smart and clever and everyone else is a dolt."
2021-04-10 23:24:52,wallstreetbets,"I never said anyone else is a ""dolt"" i just said you have no intelligence, which again you're proving me right.
