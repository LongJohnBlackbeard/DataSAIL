2021-04-19 19:45:09,wallstreetbets,I was just realizing my $DGX $145 call is about a month until expiration now and I was starting to get a little worried but then I hop on wallstreetbets and the first thing I see is the part 4 I was hoping for
2021-04-19 19:46:47,wallstreetbets,"Yur jus a rando on a mssge bord!@!

But for real, I like this DD. I haven't read it yet, only skimmed (obviously). But I think that I'm about to scroll back up and read at least 1/5th of it.

Edit: For some reason I read way more than 1/5th, and I also glanced through the previous DD's.. Went ahead and Queued up on 20 calls for ~~Apr19.~~

Edit: Edit: June 18th. Did I mention that I apparently have no idea how calendars work? just found this outmyself"

2021-04-19 19:06:24,wallstreetbets,"Got in at 36, averaged down to 31 last week. A successful flight in may - even an announcement of a test flight in earning calls - will get us over 30. I love this stock! Best of luck man."

Optionsprofitcalculator shows you will only make half of this back if SPCE is at 35$ by the end of May.  Not sure why you want to hold onto these literal lotto calls and let your money burn but whatever gets you going!.."
2021-04-19 19:18:27,wallstreetbets,"Yes sir, Down Bad but still optimistic üòÅ"
2021-04-19 18:20:22,wallstreetbets,"There is a flight coming up in May and earnings call may 5th. If it flies the stock will go up to atleast 60+!

Edit:  its extremely oversold right now IMO, it should be 35 minimum."
2021-04-19 19:52:44,wallstreetbets,How much more money do you have to play with or is that it?
2021-04-19 18:23:26,wallstreetbets,"Idk shouldn‚Äôt they have flown something already?  I think that got baked into the price.  I could see it hitting 40$ on some kind of incredibly unexpected earnings but the stock isn‚Äôt reacting to that rumor so you‚Äôre going against the trend.  

What are you thinking this ‚Äòtest‚Äô flight will be different than the past few?  And is earnings even a thing for SPCE yet?? 

I do like SPCE don‚Äôt get me wrong but there‚Äôs obviously major resistance above 30$ still, you‚Äôre waaaay too optimistic about this lol, just cause it went to 60$ doesn‚Äôt mean getting back there will be easy, it rejected that price."
2021-04-19 19:59:35,wallstreetbets,i have about another grand i might put into SPCE but thats all i'm willing to sink into this venture. I have other accounts.
2021-04-19 18:30:27,wallstreetbets,"What can I say, I like the stock.

You should always be optimistic about your investments or you shouldn't invest imo.

Either way Its a speculation play and always has been.

Its also a YOLO and I think it will print, I have two months for it to hit 51 to break even.

 I think it will hit that much sooner/go above that in May. Only time can tell. 

These calls were worth 3-4$ two weeks ago, worth 20 cents now. They are way undervalued imho and they are going to explode.

I'll be updating so you can see which way she goes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2021-04-19 18:31:30,wallstreetbets,Good luck!!  I do love SPCE and have rode it up and down and all around!  Definitely has potential for the type of price swing you‚Äôre looking for!
2021-04-19 19:15:54,wallstreetbets,Ive got a couple hundred calls spread across 5 different strike prices. All for 5/21. Only 240 shares so far. Work on that tomorrow.
2021-04-19 18:26:57,wallstreetbets,Don't have that kind of money to throw around but I bought 10 shares this morning and made almost $9 today.

Seriously, this thing is ducking ready to pop. Everything looks exactly like RKT did before it did. Not putting it in GME league.

Insane SI whichever set of figures you believe - check

Dips scooped up immediately - check

Out of shares available to short - check"
2021-04-19 19:32:12,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs interesting- I would not expect the long dated 12.5 c to be up 82% while the monthly with same strike is down 5%
2021-04-19 18:23:21,wallstreetbets,"Tomorrow‚Äôs plan for me is to buy more calls in strikes that the call buying will exceed the current open interest.  For example, every 1000 new calls bought/opened the market maker will have to go buy 100,000 shares.  So keep an eye out  if you can help the cause and pickup a few more new options that exceed the current open interest & that will start adding up quickly.  Cheers!"
2021-04-19 18:24:01,wallstreetbets,I have one 8/20 11c. I'm hoping you get crazy crazy fuck you rich here

2021-04-19 18:09:46,wallstreetbets,Fundamentally the company is looking better.  Specially when they hired a former CMS chief.
2021-04-19 18:16:03,wallstreetbets,Good job. I bought a bunch of December calls very nicely priced. Now we need people to buy actual shares. A squeeze can‚Äôt happen without share buy pressure.

2021-04-19 18:26:25,wallstreetbets,In as well. Just a reminder that Hindenburg is not short CLOV. They have no interest but their bosses are worried that CLOV short story got this far.
2021-04-19 18:10:16,wallstreetbets,I have 1 June $5 option. The rest I can just call a weird Iron Butterfly Condor Crayon Spread on $CLOV I‚Äôm not even sure if or how it can make money.
2021-04-19 19:32:42,wallstreetbets,5/21 30C or die
2021-04-19 19:51:48,wallstreetbets,Shares too. For the price action

2021-04-19 18:28:57,wallstreetbets,"I mean it broke 10 today twice, and then dropped both times just like was predicted cause of push back"
2021-04-19 19:06:46,wallstreetbets,What app is this?
2021-04-19 18:23:23,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Let people losing all their money in other plays cope that everyone in CLOV is a ""bot"", while we make 10%+ a day with potential for a 3-5 bagger in the future."
2021-04-19 19:42:20,wallstreetbets,The May $12.50‚Äôs I bought today &  the first 1000 at the open and the other half 15 minutes later.  I could have waited and got a better price but win/looses a few cents more per contract is really gonna make a difference.
2021-04-19 19:39:42,wallstreetbets,I bought the August calls at the open Friday when the stock was trading down the first few minutes.
2021-04-19 18:34:42,wallstreetbets,The problem is we are having trouble staying above $10. We gotta start making em hedge those $10 calls. 5% of the float is in them lol
2021-04-19 19:41:41,wallstreetbets,"My 200 calls are spread out between 10, 12.50, 16, 17.50 and 30."
2021-04-19 19:04:13,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm thinking about buying some calls tomorrow but could you help explain. I have an idea of what you mean but I want to be sure I fully understand. I‚Äôm guessing watching volume and open interest?

2021-04-19 19:58:16,wallstreetbets,"With that level of volume, and considering the hedge funds are monitoring this joint, wouldn't that be the perfect time for them to GTFO and avoid any potential squeeze altogether?

Edit:  Especially considering the float was at 35% (or 12.5%, according to MarketBeat)

Obviously if it even approaches the expected price target it's a win, but I was surprised to see Yahoo Finance touting it as having the same components to it as GME did in early January, so I was hoping for a big bump."

2021-04-19 19:55:14,wallstreetbets,It's still obscenely high. Likely higher than AMC and ASO were when they spiked.

2021-04-19 19:16:58,wallstreetbets,My gut instinct is that the Hedge Funds that are long on GME and AMC are short on CLOV.

Maybe this is to get AMC or GME holders to jump to CLOV. 

OR....Citadel and Melvin want the Hedge Funds that short on CLOV to feel the pressure on their liquidity when CLOV rises."
2021-04-19 19:59:59,wallstreetbets,Is DFV only investing on GME?
2021-04-19 19:23:36,wallstreetbets,"Essentially- Citadel could be telling an opposing Hedge Fund...sure you got me by the balls on GME, but I got you by the balls here. Kinda a ‚Äúif you fuck me, I will fuck you‚Äù"

2021-04-19 18:22:22,wallstreetbets,"Why are people so confused by it, money makes the world go round and everyone is interested in another GME. This sub got so much publicity, even on mainstream media, new people coming wanting a piece of squeeze pie.

The GME apes keep thinking into it way to much like its some major conspiracy."
2021-04-19 19:43:36,wallstreetbets,lol it reminds me of UWMC. A bunch of people bought into UWMC when it was 12 trying to ride the RKT high and it immediately tanked down to 8. Bag holders to this day still claim they stand by their choices

2021-04-19 19:26:50,wallstreetbets,"GME is just beginning, stop talking like its over. The DD on Clov is kinda dogshit and very speculative."

2021-04-19 19:41:36,wallstreetbets,"OP doesnt expect it to hit $30 by 5/21 but if theres a single day spike coming, his extrinsic value will skyrocket and he will dump all these calls immediately for a quick profit"
2021-04-19 19:30:57,wallstreetbets,"Im not talking like its over you are just over sensitive clearly. I am saying another, perhaps don't sit there thinking like there can only be one at a time.

Wanna talk about speculative, its very speculative to think a squeeze is likely to happen with GME when its been on constant decline since march.

Im very new here, but i believe the term is ""Bag-holder"" have fun being caught as one. Since you wanna put words in my mouth lol."
2021-04-19 19:46:53,wallstreetbets,Yeah one 10% move and these contracts are up 100%+
2021-04-19 18:02:16,wallstreetbets,at 14 i was playing old school runescape
2021-04-19 17:53:53,wallstreetbets,I totally understand how all of this works
2021-04-19 18:01:02,wallstreetbets,"So ,unless I'm mistaken, basically you retrieve the market movers from here : [https://www.tradingview.com/markets/stocks-usa/market-movers-gainers/](https://www.tradingview.com/markets/stocks-usa/market-movers-gainers/) and you retain only those which:

* have a last price less than $5 (should be irrelevant);
* have gained at least +2%;
* have a last price higher than the open (unnecessary given point #2);
* have a volume above 5M;
* have a float below 50M.

The 2nd point will lead you to buy high, will work when you're on a bullish trend until it doesn't.

Congrats on doing that at your age though, the code does look good!"

If you're serious I recommend you buy first and second semester math books and learn autodidactically. It's doable. Those courses pretty much start from scratch. They sum up and repeat the entire school knowledge, but properly.

Equipped with that, you can dive into statistical analysis and create more complex and sophisticated algorithms."

2021-04-19 17:33:23,wallstreetbets,"I find it interesting, and it seems to make sense. So basically what we find here is that 10y starts increasing a lot faster than the 2y which tends to be an indicator of a recession. Did I get that right?

Where you trying to go with this?"
2021-04-19 18:23:49,wallstreetbets,Inverted yield curve would mean the 10Yr yield is lower than 2Yr yield. This is the opposite. It means high inflation in near term

It's an easy fix but he's too stubborn to fix it because ""aI bRo"" check out the comma 2 device, 0 incidents due to the device and 50 million miles driven."

My investment thesis is a little simpler, and rarely wrong.

I'm worried I was wrong about COIN, though, because I was fully expecting it to hit the 500s on Wednesday.  I really thought the demand for the shares was gong to be redonkulous."
2021-04-19 18:07:44,wallstreetbets,"I think its important to provide both sides of the story ($300 being the bear case) so I dont mislead anyone.

The biggest attack vector against this post is ""well if volume plummets, COIN fuk'd"". so I try to work out the different scenarios of where volume can go from here.

Once we get closer to end of Q2, I'll provide an update that hopefully narrows the price target"
2021-04-19 18:36:08,wallstreetbets,TLDR: it's gonna go up or it's gonna go down.

2021-04-19 17:06:19,wallstreetbets,Well thanks for confirming my bias. Coinbase is the next FAAG.
2021-04-19 18:10:04,wallstreetbets,Can you then provide the rationale for What‚Äôs the likelihood of each scenario?   Do you view downside as 10% likely?  More ? Less?  Why?
2021-04-19 17:19:30,wallstreetbets,"hopefully if my buying power frees up, i'll go in heavier before end of Q2 and provide an update"
2021-04-19 18:21:03,wallstreetbets,"I think neutral-bear is one of the more likely cases: -15% volume each quarter, so Q3 revenue is less than Q2, Q4 revenue is less than Q3, etc. This still leaves us \~$440 PT. While I think sustained volume and trading activity is certainly possible, but its a big ask for sure. 

I think we won't see a severe volume contraction (i.e. -20+%) purely because institutional players have entered the game. They'll continue to *trade;* I highly doubt they entirely exit the market and never come back. Another good explanation is we're finally seeing real-world applications and usage of the assets -- this should encourage retail to continue acquiring these assets as new investment vehicles beyond the traditional equity markets."
2021-04-19 17:45:57,wallstreetbets,"If crypto tanks, does COIN tank too?"
2021-04-19 17:56:06,wallstreetbets,"in my opinion no. COIN only tanks if its exchange USD volumes also tank. historically this isn't really the case. Even when the assets draw-down, USD trading volume spikes because of sellers.

Coinbase collects revenue on the buy AND sell side"
2021-04-19 17:55:01,wallstreetbets,Presumably. Since its higher revenue/profit prior to DPO was due to crypto prices going up.
2021-04-19 18:06:14,wallstreetbets,"I think it could go down. I was thinking about PUTs once we get a clear indication of a bear marker, but I do appreciate the DD and think I could be wrong here."

2021-04-19 15:52:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah... She's only a big name because her ETFs shot up in 2020... But literally anyone who had cash in March of 2020 and invested it almost anything would have seen 250% returns... So... Nothing special?
2021-04-19 16:56:09,wallstreetbets,"Genuinly interested, do you have any reference, or just that every fund is leverage to the tits?"
2021-04-19 16:35:30,wallstreetbets,Ark are leveraged funds? I never even knew that
2021-04-19 19:20:21,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-04-19 17:49:10,wallstreetbets,they aren't leveraged. But they can still get whacked
2021-04-19 18:39:32,wallstreetbets,"Correct. They‚Äôre a liquidity nightmare, so if tsla gets whacked for example that Ark innovation fund goes down 3.50 a share in a day"
2021-04-19 17:47:56,wallstreetbets,"Leveraged basically means funded by debt. Most funds have debt instruments available to them, this is why your NAV doesn't necessarily translate directly to (share price √ó outstanding shares).

This is almost always found in the prospectus of the fund, and nearly all ETFs include these provisions.

Whether or not Ark uses derivatives, which is what I think you are really asking, is unclear... but less likely."
2021-04-19 17:56:23,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, tyvm"
2021-04-19 18:05:12,wallstreetbets,"What you're probably thinking of is 2x or 3x leveraged etfs, which is just a more extreme example of the same."
2021-04-19 18:09:32,wallstreetbets,"Nah, I just didn't think they could surpass 100% holdings

I do have some convered call etfs like qyld and stuff but even those only get to like 102%"
2021-04-19 15:51:34,wallstreetbets,"This post ought to be the catalyst just like the big ones on $ASO (still waiting for them to cover, probably got expiry dates out to 2023)"
2021-04-19 16:01:39,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve held them since March and been waiting for a catalyst.
2021-04-19 16:02:49,wallstreetbets,"Root is interesting... They use telematics like many companies to measure your driving habits.  The difference is that they require you to drive for a few weeks before they will insure you. In theory this will improve their loss ratios by eliminating bad drivers up front, eliminating those that are in it for fraud (because it takes weeks to get it), and will ensure the drivers that buy it truly want it. This weeds out a lot of the bad elements. They are only in 30 states so far so there's a lot of room for growth. Their loss ratio is actually pretty good at 76. This is impressive for a new insurer."
2021-04-19 16:08:45,wallstreetbets,I have this on my watch list. Seems like a good idea but I too have been in a wait and see pattern.
2021-04-19 15:33:14,wallstreetbets,Good one
2021-04-19 15:37:07,wallstreetbets,This is very interesting ape.   Wish I had an award to send to you
2021-04-19 15:43:20,wallstreetbets,So what's the catalyst?
2021-04-19 17:10:02,wallstreetbets,People have definitely talked about root. Not everything is gonna be a squeeze and this company is very early on in it's growth
2021-04-19 15:39:57,wallstreetbets,"Well, if they follow you in your car to give you a good quote, wonder whatcha gotta show them at home for the home owners insurance?  ü§™"
2021-04-19 15:54:05,wallstreetbets,So they offer a service that other insurance companies already offer. What's their edge? It's even less convenient than traditional carriers. Not seeing the upside here.
2021-04-19 18:08:16,wallstreetbets,"Nice try, citron research!"
2021-04-19 19:35:02,wallstreetbets,"I tried it out about a year ago. I got a perfect score and drive on average 2500 miles a year. WFH for the last decade. 

They still wanted around 25 bucks more a month than all state. It was about even to what I currently had for similar coverage at the time but I ended up switching to all state b/c it was way cheaper for me."
2021-04-19 16:20:29,wallstreetbets,I think he's suggesting that Walmart will announce a partnership with Root to sell insurance.
2021-04-19 17:56:12,wallstreetbets,"This seems like a really good connection to make, but wouldn't Meyer Malka's buying constitute insider trading in some way? Is there a risk to the stock price if that's alleged?"
2021-04-19 18:29:50,wallstreetbets,It's not insider trading if the deal isn't finalized afaik. I believe it has to be actionable nonpublic information.
2021-04-19 15:27:52,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd sell them some shares for $.686+.5. I paid $1.11 for my 2000 shares. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

2021-04-19 15:50:13,wallstreetbets,"April 30, 750 calls are much more likely to hit. You gotta choose your strikes carefully with Tesla. 

And you need to trade this stock frequently and lose a lot on it before you understand how it moves. Earnings will see a huge spike to sell off back down to 700 range. We will see a spike to 775 again though."
2021-04-19 15:14:05,wallstreetbets,These are so out of the money you are pretty much gambling.
2021-04-19 15:27:37,wallstreetbets,"There‚Äôs a slight albeit very dismal chance that the public will do some due diligence on that TESLA fire and read into how statistically, Tesla autopilots are getting in less accidents than regular drivers based on miles driven in a period of time. However media loves domesday stories and a lot of people scare easily. Tesla is flexing on competition in China right now as well. One of the main reasons I think NIO is going down is cuz everyone wants a TESLA and it was proven when video came out of the Tesla dealerships packed and NIO dealerships looking like ghost towns.

In our case, we pull data from IBM DB2 databases via Alteryx. We then combine the data from multiple DB2 databases and clean it up. Throw in some additional calculations and were able to spit it directly into Tableau for dynamic visual reporting."
2021-04-19 15:24:58,wallstreetbets,"I am a data analyst by trade... I've used this software a couple of times in previous roles. In all honesty, not a huge fan. It was very clunky and quirky, had a bit of a learning curve. Tableau does a much better job at dashboarding. 

They compete in a space that is full of big competitors, with no competitive advantage. With data proliferation and portability, you are no longer tied to a single analytics tool. I would personally look to see if they have a break-out app/enhancement on the horizon, or a new major customer. Otherwise, this is a risky play."

2021-04-19 15:43:41,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm in a similar boat to you and I will say the use case for Alteryx alongside Tableau is strong.  

Tableau is your front end... where the customer will interact with the data.  What Alteryx excels at is for automating your back end so that you can connect and clean your data flows into creating the data sheet that feeds your Tableau instance.  

I actually think Alteryx has a strong future, but it won‚Äôt be its own.  I think Alteryx eventually gets acquired (ironically enough... by either Tableau or Microsoft).  I own no positions nor do I plan on owning any positions anytime soon."

It's a highly controversial stock, which may make it risky. You may like that however.

I'm pretty sure you'd need to price in same detail come renewal. Even if we assume palantir had no competition, the army will likely want to make its own first. Palantir will win again, but it'll be volitile."
2021-04-19 19:45:31,wallstreetbets,"i dunno about another lawsuit on the same grounds. i guess it could happen, but the judgement will be quicker and easier because there is precedent here and lower courts are unable to go against precedent."

2021-04-19 19:38:46,wallstreetbets,Covaxin major catalyst coming within the next month or 2. Traditional non mrna covid vaccine that targets all spike proteins. 81% effective for protection from covid thats just phase 3 interim results. Ocgn receives 45% profits for us and possible for the rest of NA. Their eye play is a bit further out but were granted something on this front in europe already. Shorts have been pushing this down since end of dec. Its going to blow when it does. Hopefully 100+ at the spike but id be happy at40+
2021-04-19 15:49:34,wallstreetbets,"No, and the big reason it's about to pop is because they will likely distribute the next COVID vaccine to hit the US market."

2021-04-19 15:31:33,wallstreetbets,You have to look at it like a literal casino. When you go to the MGM there‚Äôs people in there dropping tens of thousands on odds and games that sometimes don‚Äôt even make sense. But it‚Äôs something fun for people to do and they enjoy it. That‚Äôs how I view investing. So I never go to the casino with more than I‚Äôm willing to lose. If I go in with a thousand my expectation is to lose it all.. and if I don‚Äôt that‚Äôs when magic happens
2021-04-19 16:10:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they are filing upon results of Phase III which they expect very soon. From there it's a 2-4 week wait. They have stated they expect 200m doses sold to US this year. 

On top of that, the maker has stated that they are discussing Ocugen's role expanding to include distribution to all of North America.

Finally, apparently all of the shares available for shorting have been purchased. But I don't know much about that."
2021-04-19 17:05:02,wallstreetbets,"Lol, Pfizer's ceo just came out and said a third booster will be needed. This is an annual thing. And they will have the vaccine that protects against at all variants while also being the most affordable."
2021-04-19 17:26:01,wallstreetbets,They make generic vaccines that's been proven for years and years by other companies. Not Covid vaccine which are newly developed by companies in other countries not India.  None of the vaccines developed by India has been proven or approved by FDA and you will likely never see that $30 for this stock. It's a hyped scam by Indians just like those telephone scammer from India.

>Not to mention they don't even have a contract with the US government yet.

I think it's pretty clear what you're saying. But if you don't think it's gonna moon, that's fine."

2021-04-19 15:05:27,wallstreetbets,"I have been selling cc's for quite a while now on MVIS. It's been pretty textbook so far. Wait till the stock hits $18+ and is on its way up and sell a $20 cc for ridiculous money. Never been called a single time. I'm sitting on 400 shares right now. I'm not sure if I'm going to sell anymore cc's for this month though. Like you say, it's great money, but I'm kinda expecting a breakout soon and I don't want to miss out"
2021-04-19 15:04:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I've been collecting premium on MVIS since I entered a few months ago. CSPs on the dips, into CCs on the spikes. I haven't been called away on my shares yet, but I have gotten assigned on new shares, which I didn't mind because I'm overall bullish and my avg cost has been lowered. My only concern is if a buyout is announced and my CC's haven't been closed. MVIS always has PR in the AH, so one day I'll probably get boned."
2021-04-19 18:33:19,wallstreetbets,I'm super bullish on MVIS so I just sell puts on it and since growth stocks are taking a dump I'm always getting assigned. Maybe will sell calls when it suddenly skyrockets again.
2021-04-19 15:44:43,wallstreetbets,I like these strategies that I'm reading. MVIS is one of my favorite tickers out there! That high IV can really put some tendies on the table

2021-04-19 18:02:47,wallstreetbets,You're retarded for selling calls when it's this low. Those same calls are gonna be -200% when it goes back towards 20. You should be selling CSPs right now while it's low (with high strike so you DO get assigned) then switch to cc's when it is up higher. Aka wheeling
2021-04-19 18:56:25,wallstreetbets,"Crazy bullish on $MVIS (& $URA too).

2021-04-19 18:28:51,wallstreetbets,"My biggest concern with wheeling this stock is that I do expect large swings and I suspect it will bounce before the 5/21 exp. I want my shares now, at what I think is the bottom. 

MVIS doesn't offer weeklies, otherwise I would buy in using weekly CSPs."
2021-04-19 16:18:36,wallstreetbets,All I have to do is hang in there!
2021-04-19 14:55:36,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, that is the major downside of this strategy. In order for me to sell a major price spike, I would have to buy to close my calls at outrageous prices.

However, I have an alternate plan for those situations: Roll out (and possibly up) the calls. 

I don't mind being 'locked in' because the shares print every month and I don't really want to sell a small to medium spike. I'd only want to sell a spike if it crossed past $20, and that's my strike anyway so I'm fine. =)"

2021-04-19 15:52:53,wallstreetbets,"If your shares don‚Äôt  get called away during the times you are selling CC‚Äôs, will a time come that you will just wait for the price to settle and closeout your long position? What‚Äôs your target?"

2021-04-19 16:08:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes, my catalyst for that will be when the IV plummets. 

When it's all said and done, I am hoping to exit around 20. I am comfortable exiting earlier if the play starts declining.

2021-04-19 13:49:39,wallstreetbets,Why are all CLOV posts and comments today from people that have less than 5k karma? Most of them have a few hundred
2021-04-19 13:52:58,wallstreetbets,"Attacks on CLOV are extremely similar to the ones we saw on GME and AMC on good days. Slow uptrends followed by huge red candles, millions of shares being sold in a matter of minutes. Holding üíé"

2021-04-19 16:32:35,wallstreetbets,"Well yes and no. People are always open to DD and many joined in on the CLOV short interest hype, but then counter-DD came out stating that the number was incorrect.

Even after the counter-DD, there has been a large number of 2-3 month old accounts still posting positions in CLOV.

The ""high short interest"" mixed with ""noob accounts posting positions"" is what has people raising their eyebrows.

If there was solid DD for the company, there wouldn't be as much negative sentiment."
2021-04-19 15:26:20,wallstreetbets,"Anyone who posts their CLOV position is indirectly endorsing it and encouraging people to join in. The whole point of this sub is to share your plays and provide reasoning for them.

Do you think people post their plays to DISCOURAGE people from joining them?

2021-04-19 14:10:03,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm upset about this subreddit going to shit with you idiots flooding the feed an comments sections with this dumb shit.  This sub was beautiful until GME.  Helped me make some great plays.  Now the only community brainstorming and idea posting is you thumb suckers trying to get rich instantly.  Can ***NOT*** wait for all the idiots to go broke.
2021-04-19 17:42:24,wallstreetbets,"Nah it‚Äôs just math. Unlike GME, there is a window of a few months where a squeeze can happen though"

I guess my thing is there's always been random accounts who come in and post their dd or yolos.  I mean dfv was once a random with no posting history.  That's just kind of the nature of WSB, it always has always will."

2021-04-19 17:35:05,wallstreetbets,"Definitely agree that randoms come and post, but when you go on the CLOV sub, it is basically ALL 2-3 month old accounts posting DD and their positions. Some 2 month old just dropped a 250K+ bet on CLOV.

It just seems strange that there are so many coming out the woodwork to bet so big on CLOV despite NOT participating in GME while using the same argument of ""short squeeze""."

2021-04-19 17:15:42,wallstreetbets,"You have been ""studying cannabis"" and are working doordash until you can go out west and ""get a job in that""? You. You're the loser.

I think people are just so worried that everyone's a plant that we're now at a point where the only stock people trust is gme.  

Clovs not really that new to wsb, there's been people posting off and on about them for a while.  It's just kicked up recently due to the potential squeeze there.  Especially now that we're seeing trading volume ticking u, and the price going with it."

2021-04-19 13:22:36,wallstreetbets,I love this company and their tech is amazing but their stock compensation structure makes it interesting for us. Their government contracts are increasing (especially recently with the pentagon which literally couldn‚Äôt identify comparable competitors) but yeah other than that not so many good upside catalysts until people recognize it‚Äôs potential.

2021-04-19 18:07:00,wallstreetbets,The fact that it is not well understood is exactly why I keep buying. Id salivate over $15/share. I think eventually it's $100+ stock easy. src: work in industry

There is a chance for SPY to drop to 400 before earnings which is why I'm not using margin to buy more until the week of earnings. I've been telling people PLTR price EoY should be around 25-30 since Feb , since I'm logical person that did my research (watched all their videos , read their financial statements , etc) . I even told people to sell at 26 last week (and short it) since that pump was caused by massive amount of calls being bought and will dump when MM unwinds the shares they bought to hedge."

Lockup expiration worn off and tons of interested investors. There is literally nothing but upside here. No expected catalyst means UNEXPECTED catalyst will shoot the price up.

2021-04-19 18:27:09,wallstreetbets,"If you truly believe in the future of the company. You want the stock price as low as possible. Since it gives you more buying opportunities.

Wait for the price to settle. Average down, then start selling very OTM monthly covered calls to feed your short-term return appetite. This is the smart way to play PLTR. I know people here are used to / wanting stocks that give returns in the short term. But PLTR is a long play, like at least 2 years before you'll start to see the growth you seemingly are expecting from a single presentation."
2021-04-19 18:29:42,wallstreetbets,I appreciate DD and posts that talk about the potential downside.
2021-04-19 19:26:46,wallstreetbets,After you sold it will start going up. Good luck waiting for sub 20

Hi this is the barn we went public in. 
What the fuck does that mean? It is an utterly spotless and empty barn that looks like it was just built. In it, a homeless man in a track suit rambles without a single clear and simple statement while for some fucking reason the camera just changed angles more than a Taken chase scene.

Wallstreet has experts who studied at MIT/Havard/Stanford etc. they understand the company and products 100%, thats for sure.

Second, you are completly right with the stock compensation structure. It is created to make Soros and friends rich, not people like us. It hurts, because the product is good, no question. But investing is not only about the product."

2021-04-19 16:22:20,wallstreetbets,You should have bought options
2021-04-19 16:55:51,wallstreetbets,AAPL is honestly one of the safest plays. I like how you balanced that with 300 shares of CLOV though.

2021-04-19 13:23:09,wallstreetbets,Interest rates are low but prices are out-of-control. You'd probably save the difference in downpayment over the lifetime of the mortgage but lose a ton of opportunity cost
2021-04-19 16:02:41,wallstreetbets,Where you are changes the conversation by a lot. Paying $50k over the appraised price for a house in Seattle is nothing.

Edit: plus extra appreciation from prices being driven up by low interest rates."

2021-04-19 16:42:55,wallstreetbets,Prices will fall when interest rates starts to rise. If inflation starts to pick up we can see the 10 Yr treasury yield goes to 3% and mortgage rates to 4% or higher.
2021-04-19 15:02:32,wallstreetbets,"This is a classic bubble. There has been nothing fundamental in the economy to justify a true increase in value to match the prices. It is short term, pent up demand that is driving the current price.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbearance"
2021-04-19 18:27:42,wallstreetbets,Who are you who are so wise in the ways of linguistics?
2021-04-19 17:05:12,wallstreetbets,"This^ 

The psychological feeling of owning your own home is important to a lot of people. Housing prices fluctuate, but in the long run they tend to go up quicker than inflation. If you can afford a house now and it's your dream to own your own home then why would you put it off for a couple years when you know the interest rates are definitely going to be higher, and there is no guarantee that housing prices will fall, especially with the way the government has been supporting homeowners throughout the pandemic."
2021-04-19 14:29:18,wallstreetbets,"We literally printed money and handed some of it out so people could pay their bills.  We all know why they stopped publishing M1, M2, M3 and decided not to label China a currency manipulator.  I don‚Äôt care how they try to disguise it, printing money will translate to inflation.  Anyone that can afford a real tangible asset now might want to invest in that store of wealth."
2021-04-19 13:38:26,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao what neighborhoods are you buying where people are actually defaulting from the pandemic? People are just applying to skip payments because the principal is added to the end and there's no additional accumulated interest.

Household cash reserves are literally the highest they've ever been."
2021-04-19 15:18:10,wallstreetbets,"The people who got hit hard by the pandemic are not homeowners for the most part.  They are low-paid service industry people; in most cities people with jobs like that are renters because they can't afford to buy homes.   You are not going to see a bunch of foreclosures.  The average homeowner is financially better off now than before the pandemic.  They worked from home, kept their jobs, and saved all the money that they usually would have spent on bar / restaurants / vacations / child care / gym memberships  / kids extracurricular stuff / etc etc etc.

There are a few exceptions of course, but nowhere near enough to make up for the excess demand caused by people leaving urban areas.

Prices will remain high until (at least) cities fully reopen (and people who were wanting to leave reconsider, and maybe some old decide to move there) and/or the new construction starts coming on the market in Q3 / Q4.  Whether that's enough to get supply and demand back into balance remains to be seen."
2021-04-19 13:35:41,wallstreetbets,"I think most lenders are moving the balance to the end of the loan, most people that have been living mortgage free for 6-12 months probably will just start making payments again or with prices the way they are sell for a profit and rent."
2021-04-19 15:29:01,wallstreetbets,"Sure, that's what you're hoping. Forbearance might not end for another year or two  and then you end renting still (aka wasting money) and house prices keep rising."
2021-04-19 18:41:11,wallstreetbets,"> Forbearance will end at some point and people who haven't recovered financially will be forced to sell

A lot of people that were affected by Covid weren't in the market to buy homes anyways. This sounds horrible but deaths also transferred wealth to others in an unprecedented fashion. Others also did very well during Covid. In fact I would say people that just maintained their job ended up financially better. All of the people I know that maintained their jobs said they had more money than ever. 

I know for sure that Covid accelerated my house purchase by at least a year and a half."

2021-04-19 18:21:47,wallstreetbets,"Here's my question, since this seems to be the housing sub. But if people are scrambling to buy houses where is everyone moving from?

Is everyone buying houses after living in apartments? I would think once someone buys a new house they are moving out of another house so the supply would be comparable to population growth?"
2021-04-19 17:15:18,wallstreetbets,"The material to build a house has doubled. We‚Äôre not making less money because of material costs, we‚Äôre just passing it on to the new home owner. While I agree there is a bubble, I think that bubble is tied to a lot more than short term demand and interest rates."
2021-04-19 16:55:32,wallstreetbets,The thing to justify the increase in value is the increase in the currency supply by 30% +

Housing isn't necessarily affordable to everyone and people don't tend to sell their homes very often. It's not a very liquid market in general and the government has been doing a lot to make sure people can afford to stay in their current homes.

Don't think that just because prices went up with lower interest rates that the opposite is guaranteed to happen when rates go back up."

But what about the people who can‚Äôt get a raise or find a better paying job, you might ask. Well those people are fukt.

2021-04-19 14:49:08,wallstreetbets,"While the general line of thought is valid, I think it underestimates how much of the current market increase (I hesitate to call it a bubble) is caused by real estate investment firms and not driven by consumer sales.  I work in the industry, and the percentage of our volume driven by investment buying has gone up pretty significantly in the last year.

It is quite possible that we'll see a mini-foreclosure crisis/sell off once the current legislation expires, but I'm going to guess that investors will jump on that dip and continue to artificially limit available housing stock like they've been doing since 09.  

I doubt there's going to be any significant downward movement in the overall US housing market any time soon unless there's a major catalyst (new legislation, another crash, etc.)."

2021-04-19 18:52:51,wallstreetbets,"If even half of those still remaining in forbearance hit the market over a year. That would be anywhere between at 15-33% increase in supply for existing homes sold in a single year.

Do I think it will happen? Not really, or rather I hope not, but I see a lot of confident windbags who seem to think it's not even a risk. 

* You start to create several problems, people stuck in their home because they overpaid in a hot market, then values dropped so now they're either underwater or at risk of a short sale, those with late/missed payments are no longer eligible to buy, all against a backdrop of increasing supply.
   * You can get quite the negative cascade with only a fraction of those currently at risk, so ignoring it because you think everyone gets a bailout is very na√Øve imo.

Unlike the guy above me, I don't think everyone is in forbearance still because 'free money,' if that was correct we'd see the numbers staying the same, not decreasing, so I believe those still in forbearance, for the most part, are there out of necessity."

2021-04-19 19:11:27,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a textbook squeeze play in a nut shell, take out insider shares, class B shares, insider shares that are locked up for now and the institutional shares that the majority of are positioned for long term holdings, with that in mind I think (appears others see it the same way, with the huge volume in the stock & options) we‚Äôre looking at a pretty high short position vs potentially not enough shares available to cover should the squeeze happen between now and early July before insiders can sell.  That why the shorts put that wall up every time we get around $10 or just above.  If we keep inching up, and get safely over $11 this stock could really move up fast.  I like the risk/reward.  Plus it‚Äôs pretty cheap and has several analysts with price targets in the upper teens.  It should work out pretty well, just gotta stay with it and give it time.  As always don‚Äôt risk more than what you can afford to loose if you are in short dated calls.  If you are holding stock, you‚Äôll be fine it won‚Äôt stay this low forever IMO."

These reactors are a modern ‚Äúsafe‚Äù variant which burns the majority of its fuel producing minimal waste. 

Fluor is not just a nuclear reactor producer they are an American international engineering and construction firm. Their divisions include Energy, Chemicals, Mining, and Infrastructure. 

Fluor Corp has taken on infrastructure projects in the wake of American wars abroad. In Canada they are building the Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) export facility in British Colombia. They are building the ‚ÄúAutomated People Mover‚Äù at LAX which provides automated tram services. With Bayer they are building their state of the art Cell Culture Technology Center. They build mines, casinos, hotels, reactors. In general they are a world class infrastructure producer which bodes well in the coming infrastructure projects under the present administration. 

https://www.fluor.com/projects?clientmarket=energy

As the economy slowly picks back up and with infrastructure around the corner, this stock is a strong long term play that should hit a serious catalyst when this admins infrastructure projects begin. 

To quote Zacks: 

‚ÄúIt has a solid track record of receiving awards and management is optimistic about continuation of this trend in the future as well, which is expected to drive growth. The company, being an industry leader in nuclear remediation at government facilities throughout the United States, is expected to benefit from the rising demand for energy across the globe.‚Äù

If you've worked along side Fluor on a project, you know what I'm talking about.

> can be shipped into disaster zones

You gonna ship a complete electrical grid as well? or at least a box of Amazon Basics extension cords?

> be deployed into factories for on-site generation

Why are you building factories off-grid? and just an FYI, this is a thing, except instead of nuclear, we use LPG/NG or Diesel. Generac can get you all the power you need in a few days without any permits.

> scattered through out suburbs and commercial zones to generate the power near where it is consumed

Imagine having an aluminium smelter at the mine, instead of shipping metric tonnes of bauxite across half the world to fucking Iceland. The shipping savings would be a game changer.

2021-04-19 11:41:35,wallstreetbets,These aren‚Äôt liquid salt reactors. These are more like traditional reactor cores but burn hotter and faster than traditional reactors which consumes a greater overall percentage of the fuel producing minimal waste.
2021-04-19 15:53:55,wallstreetbets,"Nuclear Engineer here. Because the NuScale module has a smaller core, it actually uses fuel less efficiently than traditional reactors. It is actually colder than traditional reactors too, but that's more of a benefit when it comes to efficiently using fuel. Don't get me wrong I think the NuScale technology is good, but it doesn't help to have misconceptions out there."
2021-04-19 18:07:49,wallstreetbets,"It seems pretty unlikely that a bunch of small reactors would burn through fuel more efficiently than one very large reactor.  Even if these miniature reactors do use fuel more efficiently, each individual unit requires its own mini cooling/generating/safety systems and their associated maintenance.  Those costs are going to add up.  And what type of efficiency are we talking about?  Does it turn fuel into heat more efficiently? or fuel into electricity more efficiently? or fuel into $$$ more efficiently?  Because it is the last one that really matters
  
  The margins on nuclear power are already pretty small.  Many large nuclear plants struggle to turn a profit.  These small ones are going to have many of the same costs as large generating stations but none of the benefits enjoyed by large scale generation.    
  
The claim is that Fluor's reactor tech is similar to traditional reactors but much more efficient, efficient enough to make small scale generation economically practical.  If that is true then why focus on small reactors at all?  There are a ton of hurdles and 'what ifs' surrounding small scale modular nuclear generation.  It makes no sense to spend the time and money developing a product with large technical and regulatory hurdles and no proven market when they could just sell the tech to existing nuclear operators."

It's a lot like walking down the toy aisle at Walmart and seeing everyone buying a new Nerf Gun and trying to figure out if the whole store is doing well.  The other aisles may very well be empty.  Some of those Nerf Gun buyers might cross shop other aisles or just get the toy they want and leave.  Until we can see all the aisles at once or at least most of the aisles we don't know.

TLDR; if you're long AMC it's a very incomplete indicator but still positive.

(1) you have to borrow so I can set my price or

(2) The share price will likely decrease so I want some profit by setting a higher % fee.

A low % fee means that they know price will increase, so the low % fee is an incentive for people to try to borrow it."

The interest accrues daily but is most likely only collected monthly or something.  They are paying interest on the full value of the stock that they are borrowing; it has nothing to do with whether they are up or down on the trade.

The rate fluctuates on a daily basis.  If you are short you agree to pay the rate as it changes.  This is necessary because the loan can be recalled at any time.  If I lent to you at 4% last week but today I can get 20%, if you don't want to pay 20% I'll just recall the shares and lend them to someone else for 20%.  Either you pay or you close the position."

2021-04-19 13:24:37,wallstreetbets,"bro, something wrong with you"
2021-04-19 18:28:48,wallstreetbets,"No it means he got 15 contracts (a contract is 100 stocks, so this is 1500 stocks) and is agreeing to pay them at $30 each by a certain date (probably may 21st). If the stock is worth more then that by may 21st he wins because he gets them cheap, if it is worth less then $30 he loses.  He also has to pay about $28 for each contract he bought (28x15=$420) which he won't get back. So he has to make all his money back plus $420 to 'win'. But if he's wrong then the most he loses is the initial $420."
2021-04-19 18:45:56,wallstreetbets,"15 contracts at a $30 strike, each is right to buy 100 shares at $30.  They likely paid < $30 for one.  If it moons beyond $30 each could be worth thousands. They can sell too before that and profit if the price climbs enough before decay."

APHA currently trades at lower than 0.8381TLRY which means buying APHA is really buying TLRY at a discount. (TLRY @ 17.77 and APHA @ 14.70 at time of writing) 

If my math checks out, 0.8381x17.77 is 14.89. Imagine buying 14.89 at a cost of 14.70.

His passion is further substantiated by the note he had pasted on his monitor during the[ 2021 JPM Healthcare Conference](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9)

&#x200B;

**‚óã 4.1 Orladeyo**‚Ñ¢ **(Berotralstat) oral pill**

&#x200B;

Orladeyo is the *first Oral approved* treatment used to prevent swelling attacks in people with *hereditary angioedema (HAE)*, disease which is estimated to affect *1 in 50,000 people*.

Berotralstat is currently approved in two countries. On December the 3rd it got approved by the FDA in the *USA*, and on January the 22nd in *Japan*. The company expects approval of Orladeyo in *Europe* to happen early Q2 2021.

&#x200B;

CEO himself Jon Stonehouse confirmed in the [last conference call, ( 22:15 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/) Orladeyo will annually be generating $500MM plus revenue.

\-Serge Belanger ( Analyst ): I think in the past you've talked about sales potential for Orladeyo of 500 million plus, are you still reiterating that target?

\- Stonehouse ( CEO ): Yeah make sure you remember the plus.

&#x200B;

Before oral Orladeyo was approved for HAE, patients would only have treatments that required usage of *needles*. This dramatically reduced the *quality of their life*, making some of them quit using the treatment. That's the main reason why Orladeyo is a game changer.

After the approval, surveys on patients were done, showing a large number of new patients that were not treated before due to needles, now willing to be treated taking an oral form pill, Orladeyo.

As it's shown in[ the January 2021 Corporate Presentation](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 13), in their recently undergone survey 59% of the patients expressed high willingness to use Orladeyo, and that number rised to 71% with Physician recommendation.

&#x200B;

Additional surveys were undergone on patients using treatments from the competition ""Cynrize, Haegarda, Takhzyro"" and the results were[ the following ones](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 14).

* **4.1.1** **Pricings/Revenue**

&#x200B;

**USA**

In the USA there currently are 10,000 patients, 7500 diagnosed and treated, 1700 diagnosed but not treated, 600 treated but not diagnosed.

Physicians expect to prescribe Orladeyo for over 41% of HAE patients. Conservatively thinking, taking 7,500 patients ( the diagnosed and treated ones ) out of the total 10,000 pool in the USA, with over[ 41% of patients prescription](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) ( page 16 ) we would conservatively aim for 3,075 patients.

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in the USA, is equal to 485,000$

&#x200B;

**Japan**

On November the 5th Biocryst undergone an agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals. A local Japanese company that will be in charge of getting new patients to be treated with Orladeyo in Japan and commerzialing it.

The day Orladeyo received the approval in Japan, Goichi Matsuda, president of Torii said the following words ""Until now, HAE patients in Japan had no therapies approved to prevent attacks, so the approval of Orladeyo marks a significant advance in HAE treatment"", ""We are pleased to have the opportunity to bring the first oral treatment option to Japanese HAE patients and are actively preparing for the commercialization"".

Japan has around 2,500 HAE patients, and Biocryst conservatively expects to at least reach 500 patients.

The amount of money that must be yearly paid to access Orladeyo in Japan, is equal to $248,500

Approval of Orladeyo in Japan issued a $15MM milestone payment from Torii.

BioCryst will receive tiered royalties ranging from 20% - 40% of Japanese sales.

&#x200B;

**Europe**

It's estimated to be around 12,000 HAE patients in Europe. Following the physician prescription of over[ 41% of patients to prescribe](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 16) for Orladeyo. We get a total of 4,920 patients in Europe.

Since pricings and jurisdictions work in a different way in Europe, the amount of money each patient will have to pay for Orladeyo is expected to be around or above Japan's $248,500/year. This number should soon be confirmed.

Approval in Europe expected to happen early Q2 2021.

&#x200B;

With this yearly prices and the amount of patients defined before, we get the following results.

&#x200B;

USA - 3,075p x 485K = 1,491,375,000$

Japan - 500p x 248,5K  = 124,250,000$

EU - 4,920p x 248,5K = 1,222,620,000$

&#x200B;

Summing it all up we get $2,751,270,000. From that number we have to subtract 123,100,000$ making it a total of $2,628,170,000. The sustraction happens as a result of the undergone Royalty agreement with Torii Pharmaceuticals and Royalty Pharma.

&#x200B;

\- On October 30, 2020 MHRA granted early acces for Berotralstat patients in UK

\- On March 11, 2021 Berotralstat received the early acces approval for HAE patients in France

\- On February 26, 2021 Berotralstat received positive CHMP opinion for Orladeyo

&#x200B;

* **4.1.2 Orladeyo value**

Having in mind the discussed numbers before, Orladeyo alone will be generating $2,628,170,000 a year, using the average mid-cap Biotech company multiplier x7. We get a total of $18,397,190,000 meaning an increase of $104,46 in the stock price.

**‚óã 4.2 Peramivir** ‚Ñ¢ **(Rapivab)**

Peramivir (Rapivab) is an antiviral drug for the treatment of influenza. Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting as a transition-state analogue inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase and thereby preventing new viruses from emerging from infected cells. It is approved for intravenous administration.

On 19 December 2014, the FDA approved Peramivir to treat influenza infection in adults. Peramivir has also been approved in Japan and South Korea and is available in Japan as Rapiacta and in South Korea as Peramiflu.

The U.S. government (department of Health and Human Services) gave BioCryst Pharmaceuticals more than $77 million to finish the Phase III clinical development of peramivir. In 2009 the department of Health and Human Services had already given about $180 million to the program.

In 2013 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA/HHS) released new funding under the current $234.8 million contract to enable completion of a New Drug Application filing for intravenous (IV) peramivir.

Rapivab is a bio-defense drug that is often stockpiled by the government. Last time being September the 26th, with a purchase of $14 million.

&#x200B;

* **4.2.1** **Peramivir value**

With all the explanations given above and having in mind Peramivir is a government bio-defense drug the value of Rapivab can not be less than $500,000,000 conservatively speaking.

&#x200B;

**‚óã 4.3 Galidesivir - BCX4430**

&#x200B;

Galidesivir (BCX4430) is a broad-spectrum antiviral in advanced development for the treatment of viruses that pose a threat to health and national security, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika.

The NIAID and BARDA have been funding the development and testing of Galidesivir for over 15 years as they recognize its importance in preparation for all future pandemics. The 31st of August, 2020 NIAID Awarded $44 Million Contract to Advance Development of Galidesivir.

Galidesivir has also demonstrated broad-spectrum activity in vitro against more than 20 ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses in nine different families, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses.  (Hepatitis C, West Nile, Dengue, Jap Encephalitis, Yellow Fever, TBEV, OHFV, and Zika), orthomyxoviruses and picornaviruses..

Galidesivir is the first antiviral that has ever shown such potential, and to top it off, it is now known from the Phase I trial and now the Brazil part 1 trial to clearly be safe and show dose-sensitive effects in people. And based on multiple animal studies, it works equally effectively as a pill that is stable for years at room temperature. Not only that, but this antiviral, unlike any of the others, has excellent penetration of the blood brain barrier as was seen in the macaque Zika virus study.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.1 Efficacy**

Galidesivir was safe and generally well tolerated in Phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics trials by both intravenous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy subjects. In animal studies, galidesivir has demonstrated survival benefits against a variety of serious pathogens, including Ebola, Marburg, Yellow Fever and Zika viruses.

NIAID on April 9th 2020 its expansion of the Brazilian yellow fever trial to include three cohorts of 8 severely affected COVID-19 patients, each being given a different IV dose regimen . Unfortunately, but obvious in hindsight, this trial was from the beginning underpowered to determine a clinical benefit. The patients were followed for eight weeks after their treatments.

The company on December 22nd announced that all three doses were perfectly safe for the patients. In addition, they found that patients had a dose-sensitive reduction in virus levels in their lungs. They went on to say that an animal model, showed that Galidesivir significantly reduced COVID-19-associated lung damage.

Despite all this and even though the trial was not even powered to detect a clinical difference in the patients, the NIAID, after finding an insignificant difference in outcomes between the small numbers of drug-treated and placebo-treated patients, inexplicably decided to discontinue clinical trials of it for COVID-19, to the great confused dismay of investors and perhaps even taken advantage of by short hedge funds who brought the stock down in late December.

Bear in mind that during this trial, one of the most lethal strains of COVID-19 we know of was affecting the Brazilian trial sites, later known now as the P.1 or Manaus strain, and could have easily negatively affected the clinical outcomes of this small trial too given that the trial was focused on very sick patients more likely to carry this bad strain.

Interfering with the replication process is a well-established antiviral strategy that has been successfully exploited in developing such life-saving drugs as the nucleoside inhibitors of HIV and acyclovir for herpes simplex complex. This approach could allow a single broad-spectrum drug like galidesivir to address gaps in the U.S. government‚Äôs medical countermeasure plan and to possibly replace multiple, pathogen-specific drugs for use in response to both natural outbreaks and bioterrorist threats.

&#x200B;

* **4.3.2 Galidesivir value**

We must have in mind that Galidesivir is a Government funded bio-defense drug, that aims to treat a wide range of viruses as explained before. Its global stockpiling for future pandemics is also an absolute certainty given its long-term stability. With all the given explanations, conservatively talking Galidesivir can not be worth less than $1B this is 5,67$.

&#x200B;

**‚óã 4.4 FOP - BCX9250**

FOP is an ultra-rare, severely disabling condition characterized by the irregular formation of bone outside the normal skeleton, also known as heterotopic ossification (HO). HO can occur in muscles, tendons and soft tissue. Patients with FOP become bound by this irregular ossification over time, with restricted movement and fused joints, resulting in deformities and premature mortality. There are currently no approved treatments for FOP.

There are an estimated 3,500 to 9,000 patients worldwide, with 900 diagnosed so far. Currently there aren‚Äôt any approved treatments.

Market size for this treatment is estimated to reach 500M-900M in 2025, growing to 3B in 2028 as more patients are diagnosed. With a price ranging from $900K-$1M/year.

Last December the 21st Biocryst announced positive Phase 1 results

&#x200B;

‚ÄúBCX9250 was safe and well tolerated at all doses studied, with linear and dose-proportional exposure supporting once-daily dosing.‚Äù.

‚ÄúIn preclinical studies, BCX9250 demonstrated potency for the target kinase, selectivity, safety and strong suppression of HO in animal models.‚Äù

&#x200B;

* **4.4.1 BCX9250 Value**

BCX9250 study will most likely take 4 years to finish, this is, until 2025. By then the potential market we will be aimming for, will be $750,000,000 aprox.

Drugs that are in Phase 1 studies are said to have a 10% chance of making it to the market. Following that, BCX9250 as of now shuld be valued at $75,000,000 = 0.43$

**‚óã 4.5 Oral Factor D inhibitor - BCX9930**

&#x200B;

BCX9930 is a novel, oral, potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of Factor D which recently completed Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases.

The 3rd of August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for oral Factor D inhibitor, BCX9930.

This is how Bill Sheridan ( *Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President )* defined [BCX9930 in the last conference call ( 22:00 )](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/mqqo89/bcrx_biocryst_apr_14_2021_at_845_am_edt_20th/)

""*BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project, this is a potent specific Factor D inhibitor. So, the mechanism of action is to block the enzymatic activity of that complement enzyme, that enzyme sits at the very start of the alternative pathway of complement. So, that opens up a whole set of opportunities across diferent diseases that are driven by dysregulation of that alternative pathway of complement and the amplification loop that's embedded in that pathway""*

* **4.5.1** **Staff excitement**

Staff team from Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc seem to be really positive and excited about the incoming future of BCX9930. Such excitement has been seen in the last conference calls where staff members such as the CEO Jon P.Stonehouse, or the Vice President, William P.Sheridan would say the following words.

&#x200B;

*‚ÄúEmbarrassment of riches‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWe agree with Alexion that creating a potent specific and great oral Factor D inhibitor is a great challenge, and we are happy we have one‚Äù*

*‚ÄúMy only concern is i have no concerns‚Äù*

*‚ÄúPipeline in a molecule‚Äù*

*‚ÄúMy aim is to make c5 inhibitors obsolete‚Äù*

*‚ÄúThis is Big‚Äù*

""*BCX9930 is a really terrifically exciting project*

&#x200B;

* **4.5.2** **Phase I study**

On March 22, 2021 BCRX announced that[ BCX9930 will be advancing from Ph1 to pivotal trials in PNH](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/7d6e0bdb-fc11-4653-a0cb-a8c64e159082) following the successful proof of concept trial.

The company announced that a Pivotal trial for PNH, and proof of concept trials in renal complement-mediated diseases are expected to begin in 2H 2021.

A pivotal trial is typically a Phase III clinical trial in the multi-year process of clinical research intended to demonstrate and confirm the safety and efficacy of a treat. A successful pivotal trial is required as evidence for drug marketing approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

On March 22, the company unveiled BCX9930 Ph1 data. The most relevant information from that Ph1 is mentioned below.

""100 percent of treatment-na√Øve patients and 83 percent of C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients were *transfusion-free*. *Prior to the trial*, 22 percent of treatment-na√Øve patients and 17 percent of C5 inadequate responders were transfusion-free ""

&#x200B;

"" Hemoglobin levels increased by a mean of 3.5 g/dL in treatment-na√Øve patients and 3.2 g/dL in C5 inhibitor inadequate response patients; at last visit, mean hemoglobin levels were 11.8 g/dL and 12.2 g/dL, respectively ""

&#x200B;

To understand properly how positive BCX9930 data was, below you can find a photo were the main undergone studies in this kind of inhibitors is shown, with the results they achieved. What mainly should catch your attention is the Hemoglobin change from baseline and the % of transfusion units reduction from baseline - This data has been gathered by Barclays.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.3 Alternative Pathway**

What makes BCX9930 a game changer, is the wide spectrum of Alternative Pathway Dysregulation disease it can treat. It can treat up to[ 8 diseases](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/f093d843-a642-41c6-8a65-1b5d1800f6cd) (page 26) as of now, that's why insiders call it ‚ÄúPipeline in a molecule‚Äù. Those 8 diseases are shown in the pic below.

&#x200B;

1- PNH (Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)

2 - aHUS (Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome)

3 - ANCA vasculitis (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis)

4 - Lupus Nephritis

5 - IgAN vasculitis

6 - C3G (Glomerulonephritis)

7 - PMN (Primary membranous nephropathy)

8 - IgAN (IgA nephropathy)

&#x200B;

* **4.5.4 Potential market size by 2025**

Assuming BCX9930 will be approved by 2025, and it will be able to treat the previously mentioned 8 diseases, we reach to the following conclusion. The potential market size BCX9930 will be aiming for by 2025 scores up to $28,56B - $51B / year. This numbers are explained below, stating the yearly market size each of those 8 diseases aim for.

&#x200B;

1 - 2 ""  [Due to COVID-19, the market for PNH and aHUS was anticipated to grow from US$ 4855 million in 2020 to US$ **7023 million** by 2026; it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.89% during 2021‚Äì2026.](https://www.marketresearch.com/QYResearch-Group-v3531/Global-PNH-aHUS-Size-Status-13306748/)""

3 - ‚Äú Anca vasculitis prevalence in the USA rounds 10-20 per million = 3300-6600 patients. As a treatment example we use Soliris, which costs $500,000/year. We would aim for 1,65B - 3.3B market size as of now. Expected to grow by 2025""

4 - ‚Äú"" The global systemic lupus erythematosus market size is expected to reach USD 3.08 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc., exhibiting a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period. ""

5 - 8 ‚Äú""IgAN. The gathered disease prevalence data varies according to in which coutry the study has been undergone. Data gathered from the undergone study in East Asia, show the prevalence rounds  45 / million. meaning 14,850 patients, or a potential 7,25B market size using Soliris's yearly price  ""

6 - ""C3G:  Prevalence in the USA round 14-140 per 1M people = 4620-46,200 patients. If those patients were to be treated with Soliris which costs $500,000 / year, the potential market size we aim for rounds  2,31B - 23,1B ""

7 - "" PMN prevalence is similar to the one of IgAN, so we would potentially aim for a similar market size, meaning 7.25B""

&#x200B;

* **4.5.5 Alexion buy out**

On December the 12th, 2020 Alexion announced that AstraZeneca was going to buy them out for 39B. More than 90% of their revenue come from their ‚Äú""""Factor D""""‚Äù  C5 inhibitor, being that the main reason why AstraZeneca wanted that buy out to happen.

You might think, why does this matter? Well, remember we have a Factor D which has shown to be more effective than Alexion‚Äôs, and is able to treat more diseases than they do aswell. This buy out reflects how undervalued BCX9930 is.

Apart from the buy out, I think it's essential to mention that Alexion bought Achillion's ""Factor D"" when it was in Ph2 for $930MM.

In 2019 Alexion's SOLIRIS¬Æ (eculizumab) net product sales were $3,946.4 million. Soliris is currently approved to treat PNH and aHUS. Have in mind BCX9930 is able to treat 8 diseases, aiming for a wider market, while having greater efficacy/safety profile.

As a quick example, using the average biotech mid-cap x7 revenue multiplier, and the revenue Soliris managed to generate in 2019,  3,964B = 27,748B. It would mean a SP value of $157.56 for BCRX. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger revenue opportunity.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.6 Phase II study**

Despite the company not PR'ing the start of the phase II study of BCX9930, the official page of[ clinacal trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04702568), show that the start of phase II study was December the 18th, 2020. This is extremely bullish since it reasures our thoughts that Ph I data readout will be good and enough to keep the study going.

&#x200B;

* **4.5.7 Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**

BCRX recently did a survey with 23 patients, 12 of them using Ultomiris and the other 11 Soliris. The survey showed that 91% of the patients were interested in switching due to the reasons explained in the pic below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uud6ce7rx2u61.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8d90f157a39f94bf07330e06c159887435da70d

Some of the patients treated with BCX9930 were asked some questions, among them, the 6th one expressed his desire to be able to be treated with BCX9930 oral pill. As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are highly willing to switch from needles to oral-pill form treatments.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/niewqlqsx2u61.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8cba43280c8411a0b425c4974ce860115731620

&#x200B;

* **4.5.8 BCX9930 From a Ph1 to a Ph3**

On March 22, 2021 BCX9930 PNH Ph1 data was shown, the obtained results were so good that it enabled BCX9930 jump from a[ Ph1 to a pivotal Ph3 trial in PNH](https://adisinsight.springer.com/trials/700335293), totally skipping the Ph2.

Additional proof of concept BCX9930[ Ph2 trials in Renal Complement-Mediated diseases](https://adisinsight.springer.com/trials/700335296) will be made.

Straight jumping from a[ ph1 to a pivotal ph3](https://adisinsight.springer.com/trials/700335293) trial, is something that's not common in the bio world and could be taken as a really bullish sign. Apart from it being a bullish sign, it accelerates the process of development of the drug, giving it a chance to hit the market in a smaller span of time. The quicker the drug is in the market the better, and the more value it brings for investors.

&#x200B;

**4.5.9** **BCX9930 valuation**

Having in mind BCX9930 is a potential *best-in-class treatment*, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their ‚ÄúFactor D‚Äù c5 inhibitor, and the yearly market size BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the $28,56B - $51B mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a 30% of Alexion‚Äôs buy out price, this is 11.7B meaning 66.44$.

&#x200B;

[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/c8fck3ytx2u61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2622d005e26eab918e1d33ae84bfe605f34b90a3)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* **5. Strong BO Buy Out candidate**

As we have explained in the Institutional section before, all good bio-tech investors do know who Alexander J.Denner founder of Sarissa Capital is. After recently increasing his stake in BCRX, along with BlackRock, he now owns a 5% of Biocryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Denner, has increased his position in BCRX by an stunning 789% in the last 3 quarters, showing strong conviction in the company.

Since Denner opened his position in Alexion, it took him 5 months to close the buy out deal, as shown in the picture below

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6y598y4yx2u61.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c5ce6aa1e60151aea85e69eaa850c8f3362f8e7

After this exhaustive analysis on the company, we can easily acknowledge that BCRX is more than a strong BO candidate. A buy out coming from BIIB, company where Denner forms part of the BOD board of directors, would make total sense in the following 2 years once BCX9930 Factor D phase III data is unveiled.

&#x200B;

It also is important to mention that Bank of America added BCRX to the list of top M&A candidates         ( Mergers and Acquisitions ) as of October 30th, 2020. Stating how they believe BCRX will have a strong revenue growth in the incoming years.

&#x200B;

* **6. Alexion's performance with Soliris**

As we have explained before, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has its own """"""""Factor D""""""""  C5 inhibitor inhibitor called Soliris.

Alexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we could expect from Biocryst's in the incoming years. From 2007 to 2014 Alexion's stock price grew a 1777%. Being valued at 10.5$ in 2007 and 186.6$ in 2014.

Revenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their Factor D was approved to treat additional diseases, and the market size it captured became wider.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j8gvx3g2y2u61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=d69e305f2683f4cc9681224addf471655fa54038

Biocryst Pharmaceuticals managing to do the SP move Alexion did, is more than doable with the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind Alexion made 66.4 MM revenue the first year while BCRX at least expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo, apart from it, additional revenue generated by Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings may come. Incoming Earning Reports are meant to be potential catalysts for the company, gradually becoming more meaningful as the market size they capture with Orladeyo becomes wider.

&#x200B;

* **7.** **De-risked company**

Last December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a Royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management. With this agreement BCRX was funded with $325,000,000 in order to support Orladeyo launch. Setting the company in an attractive position of not needing to do any money rising ""Offering"".

Jon Stonehouse CEO, also confirmed that the company will not need to do offerings anymore. The fact that the company is already generating revenue with Orladeyo is another strong evidence that confirms money risings will not be needed anymore.

It's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved. Showing how bullish they are on BCX9930 and their willingness to invest at it.

* **8. Forward looking statements**

&#x200B;

1. From now on EarningReports should be catalysts and positive for the company, obtaining better results each quarter as the company settles down and receives additional approvals for Orladeyo in different countries.
2. Orladeyo approval in Europe / Germany launch.
3. The company will have to provide some colour on the BCX9930 PNH pivotal trial, how it will be planned etc etc... Aswell as the PH2 trials in complement-mediated diseases.
4. BCX9250 Next steps should soon be shared by the company
5. BCX4430 Galidesivir recently completed a Ph1, additional information about the study may be given. It's important to mention that this study was fully funded by the NIAID. Next steps for Galidesivir trials may soon be given.
6. Galidesivir/Rapivab stockpilling.

* **9. Conclusion**

After this exhaustive analysis, we come to the conclusion that BCRX is severely undervalued, and if we sum up the true value of the pipeline, it should be valued around 180$. The StockPrice fair value  number will keep growing as we keep getting data updates from the on-going studies and Orladeyo revenues keep growing, making it an excellent long-term hold and buy out candidate.

I currently do have a position in this company, my average entry price being around the 4$ range. My initial plan is to hold the shares for the long term, at least 2 years more provided that we don't get bought out earlier. I expect the StockPrice to keep rising as Orladeyo revenues flow in and BCX9930 trials keep progressing, aswell as the rest of the pipeline."

2021-04-19 12:08:48,wallstreetbets,"Orladeyo revenues could disappoint, 9930 could fail in PH3 trials.  The failure rate in PH3 is approximately 50-50.  I believe the data in 9930 suggests that it will succeed in PH3 but one would need to be looking at PH3 trials across many companies to take a strong opinion on whether or not 9930 data is stronger than normal.

Valid point but for anyone who needs to hear it biotech plays are high risk/high reward and anyone who can‚Äôt list the risks off the top of their head probably shouldn‚Äôt invest in biotech.

The research covered the rest well - no dilutive finding necessary and strong cash.  Likely, all company operations funded by revenue next year and fully profitable 2H 2022 - even before 9930 is monetized. I mean, those risks were addressed."

2021-04-19 11:59:14,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs biotech.  Greater than 90% of small biotechs fail.  But, in biotech, if you wait until revenues are reported, you will have missed the 2000% run.  

This is great company because it is far past the point where most biotechs fail (Orladeyo is post FDA approval and 9930 is PH3 pivotal trails ‚Äî I believe the failure rate drops to 50-50).

So, if you look at the research and think Orladeyo revenues will bring in revenues equal or greater than necessary to justify a 1.8B marketcap‚Äî you have a safe investment.  If you look at the research and believe 9930 will eventually be approved with a broad label, you have an explosive wealth making investment.

You could wait 3 years until peak Orladeyo revenues are reported and 9930 is FDA approved with revenues reported ‚Äî but then you‚Äôd be a dividend investor.  Or, just kinda looking back going, ‚Äúwow. that was a great run.‚Äù

To be part of the run, you need to take an opinion on whether or not the company will succeed and invest before the final outcome is determined."

Anyone that thinks there is no risk in this investment is just an idiot.

2021-04-19 13:43:32,wallstreetbets,If 15% of HAE patients use Oraladeyo (which is pretty much a no-brainer unless the drug has issues) they hit the $500M mark.
2021-04-19 12:45:33,wallstreetbets,"Firstly. CEO himself as i stated confirmed in the last ConferenceCall they will bring 500MM PLUS revenue with Orladeyo. I added a link to it so that you can confirm it. That's the Most conservative scenario. Secondly as i stated aswell, the competition use NEEDLES, Orladeyo uses ORAL PILLS, which brings QUALITY of life for patients. As i also stated there have been multiple surveys asking the competition whether they would or not switch from their actual treatment to Oraldeyo.

Thirdly, I've never said Peramivir is worth ""Billions"" I said 500MM, as i stated it, that's basically what the development of it cost it brings annual revenue even if its small. This year its confirmed it will bring 7MM.

Galidesivir is an antiviral fully developed by the government NIAID. They do not reveal much info about the studies and they take a long time often. Thing is they FULLY fund the study, its basically a drug for free no expenses.

I nearly spend daily 2-3h learning about this world, and that's what I recommend for new traders. Open a StockTwits account, spend daily hours there, see what you can learn from others and simply enjoy the process."
2021-04-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Supply Chain Disruptions and You: A Discussion OK, so, I have a thought and I want your opinion on it. I've been trying to figure out why the market has been so choppy lately, even things like Semiconductors where they literally can't physically make enough to meet demand. There's a six month wait to buy a new refrigerator, and I haven't seen my favorite coffee product in over three weeks. 

Then it hit me. My coffee isn't out of stock because of unprecedented demand, it's because the supply chain is *so* disrupted that they can't get the resources they need to make it. I'll bet it's the same thing with Semis and appliances and all that. But how can that be? There was that ship disrupting trade for a few days, but I think a lot of people (myself included) are forgetting that it takes *time* to bring products to market -the more complicated the product or its components the longer it takes.

Covid. We crashed hard when the effects of Covid were first becoming apparent, but since then we've recovered, right? **Wrong.** Those disruptions have been working their way through the supply chain for the last year and they're just now starting to hit for more complex products as manufacturers draw down their reserves and find that their suppliers have been doing the same. Maybe the *raw* materials are available again, but that doesn't matter if it's going to take a few more months to turn those raw materials into components.

*If* that's the case, it could explain why industries like tech have been underperforming of late. There's a mismatch between the perception that we're returning to normality and the reality that we're still feeling the aftershocks of a nearly global shutdown in manufacturing and trade.

*If* that's the case, here's what *I'm* thinking is the play:

* Indices: Continue to moon. Sectors are coming back online and once reality catches up to perception even the laggards like tech will start to contribute again and there's nowhere to go but up. 

* High Industry: ü¶ò Gang for a few months. This is where the majority of the disconnect is. They're not working flat out trying desperately to meet demand, the demand is there but they *can't* meet it because they haven't got the material to produce more than a pittance of what's required. How long did disruptions at the bottom of the stack last? That's how long these guys are going to bounce around as people variously pile back in but as many leave because they realize there's still a ways to go before the tippy top of the manufacturing stack is stable again.

* Retail: Tepid to mildly bullish. You can't sell what you can't have, but they've got a lot of pent up demand, and when they start getting things back in stock I reckon the ones that have survived will feed the bulls quite nicely. 

* Raw Materials/Mid Level MFG/ Transportation: Either back to normal or Moon baby. Depends, really. They're likely struggling to meet demand as well, but I feel more bullish on them overall. Their consumers are the ones who just can't get enough of what they want -High Industry. And they *can* be working flat out. This is where I'm personally leaning toward dropping my cash for a while. For them it seems like the disruption has largely passed and I'll be expecting big things over the next few months. The counterpoint, I suppose, would be that it's more or less business as usual for them, so there may not be a true moon shot.

That brings me to the final thing I'd like to discuss. Idiosyncratic vs Systemic risk. I've been talking in broad terms about entire industries or groups of industries, but let's face it, indices are a little boring. They're boring because thanks to diversification they're a bit safer than their constituent parts in isolation. This seems like a personal risk tolerance question -are you happy taking the risk that Bob's Copper Refinery is going to win the big contract (or not) or are you more comfortable riding the broader recovery through some copper specific ETF that I haven't found yet (at least not any that can be discussed here)? That's really a question only you can answer, but I'll let you in on a little secret: the big boys don't do either. They diversify, but just enough that their idiosyncratic risk (the risk that an individual company runs into headwinds specific to them) is mitigated. Even making a bet on two different companies in the same industry can *dramatically* reduce your idiosyncratic risk. You're still at the mercy of *systemic* risk (see the ARKs), but there's no avoiding that.

2021-04-19 10:17:50,wallstreetbets,"It also is a great example of the Bull Whip effect which is cause when a sudden increase or decrease in demand in a Just In Time Inventory supply chain that is more or less globally adopted, if something jumps in demand it takes time to go through each part of the supply chain for the demands to reach the customer especially in Just In Time which unlike the 80s you have little to no reserve inventory which the bull whip recks your supply chain even harder.

There are probably links out there and some one can probably explain it better, I was a supply chain student but a shitty one so I‚Äôm typing this between work at a warehouse."

2021-04-19 13:03:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm just a lowly desk jockey for one of Uncle Sam's favorite suppliers, but I spent almost all of 2020 pushing out tens of millions of dollars in inventory in an effort to help conserve cash flow due to covid. I've seen suppliers fire/furlough employees, cut shifts and hours, and completely halt certain product line production. We've even had one or two close their doors, permanently.

I am concerned this k-shaped recovery is going to be even more difficult the next few years as I'm already starting to see new cracks developing with my suppliers. Prices and lead times are through the roof, suppliers demanding ordering 50 widgets when you only need 10, and anything running late is simply blamed on covid. Tack on program level and middle managers wanting reports on every little thing and you have the recipe for a crazy 2021 with no end in sight.

No one wants to be stuck with the inventory but everyone else wants what they want, right now. 

It really does feel like things will get worse before they get better."

2021-04-19 13:31:46,wallstreetbets,containers are in short supply which drives up the cost. shipping times are longer simply because ships are just sitting out on the water waiting to dock for weeks at a time due to a shortage in dock workers. then when the cargo finally gets unloaded there's also a chassis shortage and a driver shortage for that last mile delivery. logistics is clogged up every step of the way.

2021-04-19 10:36:01,wallstreetbets,"As a Class A CDL holder I'll pipe up here.

It is NOT a lack of drivers, it is a lack of wages.  The big companies, Swift etc want hordes of low wage slaves working for 25-30 cents per mile.  The government is no longer enforcing the requirement that a CDL holder be able to read, write and speak English.  An over the road driver can drive 11 hours a day, and work a total of 14.  Some of these restrictions were waived due covid.  Even the better companies where jobs are readily available pay around 50-60 cents a mile.  With enough work that is around $75k/year.  Not much considering that you are away from home almost the entire year.  Wages have been held down by flooding the market with cheap labor, just not cheap enough for the big firms.  Add in about $5k for training, (or 2 years indentured servitude to an outfit like Swift).

Owner/operator is a whole different game, with shipping brokers siphoning off most of the money to be made, leaving crumbs for the operators.

I just shuttle trailers on weekends for some extra cash to pay for kids private school.  No way would I take an over the road job without wages increasing 200-300%.

Bottom line the big firms have enough drivers.  Most of the others can't compete because they don't have a supply of drivers that will work for slave wages.  If they pay fair wages their shipping rates are too high (this applies to companies bidding on the open market).  However, try and find a job trucking for Walmart (directly, not a sub contractor), Fed Ex, UPS etc.  You practically have to know someone, as they have their own fleets to avoid disruptions, and pay well ($35/hour in the midwest)"
2021-04-19 09:37:50,wallstreetbets,Will they pay for training and licensing?
2021-04-19 12:35:55,wallstreetbets,"No.

Blame the safety rules imposed a few years back, on funds to states that didn't impose extreme health restrictions on CDL applicants. The ""logic "" was sound,  but not realistic. 

Diabetics cannot obtain a CDL now. People with heart conditions. People with q health issue that may or may not arise were blocked. I owned 6 trucks and drove 1 myself because I'm cheap. Most would say because they aren't lazy, but thats BS. Pocketing .32 a mile myself, instead of paying it out, as well as taking car of the vehicle like it should be....because I paid for it, saved me 89k and up a year. 

When the changes went in to effect and diabetic was tacked on to my physical, I was unable to renew my CDL. 2 years later 3 more guys. Finding people who were not fucking yahoos out of driving school became impossible and I could nolonger remain solvent as things were progressing with insurance and binding rates doubling every 6 months

Meanwhile the 50 companies who will take a 21yr old who thinks big trucks are tanks,are gobbling up and burning through these idiots, fucking the entire insurance side of trucking. They created a way to burn out small trucking companies which was compounded by we who drove for 20+ years, making deadlines at the cost of our health, so mamma and the kids had everything .

Now those guys, the ones who bust ass to get it done, ending up with heart conditions, cholesterol issues, diabetes (2 gallons of mnt dew and 8 packs of smokes gets your TVs delivered from California to New York in 2 days) and a plethora of health related issues that MAY CAUSE a scenario where you just DIE while driving, and wreck into 10 other cars, killing 8 people, is why those restrictions were put in to place.

But it's that dirty secret that exists in all industries. Someone is dying or going to die to ensure consumerism is met with products. Big truck fatalities were no higher, based on vehicles on the road, from 2001 to 2016, they were lower due to vehicle safety changes.....but some plant eating twat had to champion a no issue.....and thats why you have delivery problems.

The guys who will do the job are no longer legally able to. The guys hired to do the job miss home,pushy, and sponge Bob, so they take twice as long to deliver the same product,  and that is the bulk of your Swift,JB hunt, Covenant, US express....etc...etc drivers.  Kids who happy dragging feet and making 500.00 a week...

So you have companies calling every logistics outfit, hammering out contracts with penalties for slow/late delivery. It means the 3500.00 cost to ship 250,000.00 in TVs gets reduced to 1200 when its late. You will still buy the TV, they save.money, the companies keep hiring .17 a mile kids, and your specialized bullshit coffee hits shipped out when it gets shipped, not when you want it.



BUT....care to know what gets shipped on TIME at about 90% delivery time met? Fucking cigarettes. There are many kids who DO take to driving like a duck to water and they end up on those runs.

Know whose fright is the slowest? Uncle Sams. I delivered 40k lb of paper....to Alameda that was 7 months late, had been sitting in a container waiting to be picked up for half a year. Because Uncle Sam is another padding customer.


TLDR: Buy Walmart coffee and get off your high horse and blame semiconductor shortages on Asian mining farms..and blame trucking issues on whole plant food diets."
2021-04-19 09:46:11,wallstreetbets,So do you reckon they eat the costs of increased wages or do they pass that along to their customers (and then eventually the consumer at large)?

If so, could that be fueling an even greater lower supply chain shortage and demand, increasing prices, but also further increasing the revenue for these lower supply chain companies (that have survived)? I‚Äôm assuming many of the remaining materials/etc companies use ABLs and can leverage their AR to keep afloat through the current cash flow crunch. Its going to be interesting to see this play out"

2021-04-19 10:50:46,wallstreetbets,"I think I'd heard about that. If I can ask, do they have to pay for the berths the ships occupy while they're waiting to be unloaded? Does that go to the port authority or someone who can be traded?"

2021-04-19 12:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Former dispatcher of longhaul Own Ops here.

If good drivers aren't making 100k profit after taxes for being a long-haul own op, they're  being underpaid. Truck maintenance, truck insurance, labor, etc. Being away from family and long, long days and lots of headaches dealing with people at shipping and receiving. Trucking is a lifestyle that most aren't willing to do.  


I'll second that there's not a lack of drivers, there's a lack of companies wanting to pay a living wage using supply and demand as their justification... well... the chickens always come home to roost. Their cheap rates pushed out the supply of many potential drivers because the pay wasn't worth it and now look who is begging for truckers? ""My lack of drivers...."" It's always funny to hear some guy on the other end of the phone saying drivers are being overpaid while their owners make $500+ per load clicking a button."
2021-04-19 10:45:17,wallstreetbets,"As a recruiter, 50-60 cents for teams and .73 cents for layover. Layover is 4 days driving and three days home. Local drivers get hourly rate $28 an hour and they work 5 days 8 hours. 
Swifts suck I agree but not all do. Walmart workers get paid far less and go home everyday. Some people who make more work work in an office and don‚Äôt get a good work life balance. People are not even applying is the problem which again highlights the shortage. Swift has a retention problem because their pay sucks and drivers just get the experience with them so they can work for a better company."
2021-04-19 10:37:48,wallstreetbets,"Some companies do.  In exchange you have to work in sub-human conditions for 2 years at a very low wage.  See Swift.  Or you can take a class elsewhere, around $5k give or take."

b) shutting the supply chain off for months last year was bad, and the routes still haven‚Äôt worked themselves out

c) all of the equipment is being held up stateside or elsewhere because we ordered too much all at once, and our ports are slow as molasses - current delay at Long Beach is STILL 2-6 weeks (ridiculous)

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

2021-04-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"It is safer to drive a Tesla than other brands in general. Do you feel this is a true stat or because of the people who buy Tesla's  

[CEO Elon Musk](http://https//www.foxbusiness.com/category/elon-musk) claimed that Tesla vehicles with Autopilot engaged are now approaching a 10 times lower chance of an accident than the average vehicle.¬†

In the first quarter of 2021, the company registered one accident for every 4.19 million miles driven with Autopilot engaged. For those driving without Autopilot but with the Tesla's active safety features, the company registered one accident for every 2.05 million miles driven. As for those driving without Autopilot or active safety features, the company registered one accident for every 978,000 miles driven.¬†

In comparison, the most recent data from the National Highway Transportation Security Administration, the auto industry's top safety regulator, finds that there is an automobile crash in the United States every 484,000 miles.¬†"
2021-04-19 08:57:06,wallstreetbets,"Read the data of the statistics - that‚Äôs really only Marketing News. In Germany we have ‚ÄûADAC‚Äú which analyzes all accident data‚Äôs of all cars in Europe and Tesla is on the top of all accidents.
In general electric cars are having 20% more accidents just because they are silent and people actually look on their smartphones than on the street - so not always the drivers or cars fault. But Tesla has a 50% higher accident quote than all other companies in Europe. Unfortunately I only have a German Link.

The autopilot feature is nice; but like another guy said, it's almost got me into some bad situations. That said, the collision avoidance measures are nice; only thing I really worry about is some fucknut rear ending me."
2021-04-19 08:44:18,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs only because people take over that autopilot is ‚Äúsafer‚Äù my Tesla has nearly killed me many times freaking the fuck out over the slightest bend in a road.

2021-04-19 09:39:33,wallstreetbets,"Driving a Tesla is safer than most cars, the crash test ratings are extremely good, and the accident avoidance is top notch. Not driving a Tesla and letting a feature in its testing phase drive instead,  is more dangerous."
2021-04-19 11:22:06,wallstreetbets,"IMO a metric we can‚Äôt measure but that is essential is how safe would roads be if every car was on autopilot? Let‚Äôs say even Tesla‚Äôs current autopilot, not true autopilot. I‚Äôd wager much, much safer overall. The more AI vehicles there are on the road, the safer driving will be, until you‚Äôre left with a few hold outs who end up with insane insurance premiums."

These algo's all send data back to Tesla which allows them to further improve upon it. 

I'd say a few more years and I won't worry about falling asleep at the wheel. üòÇ"
2021-04-19 08:51:08,wallstreetbets,"That stat is a little misleading but I believe it.  In general it is safer to drive on the highway and that is where autopilot will be engaged the most.  

I do think autopilot is safer... As long as the driver is paying attention and not in the back seat or sleeping.  It is a always alert system that can avoid most accidents."
2021-04-19 09:21:56,wallstreetbets,"Tesla has data on crashes per X miles with and without FSD engaged for their own vehicles only. With FSD has significantly lower crash rates, so yes, it is safer than cars without FSD."
2021-04-19 09:49:40,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the fatality rate per TSLA crash I wonder.. comparatively
2021-04-19 09:19:31,wallstreetbets,"You can chock a lot of that up to the fact Tesla‚Äôs have the highest safety rating available and then they went beyond that and added more safety features just for fun. The cars are reliable and will tell you when it‚Äôs suggested to service them. And yes, given that they cost more than the average vehicle it‚Äôs likely owners can afford repairs and do them more often.

Compare that with the millions of people driving ‚Äò08 civics that are rusted through to the pavement with sandpaper for brakes and I think it makes complete sense why Tesla‚Äôs accident rates are so low."
2021-04-19 09:11:14,wallstreetbets,"1. They accelerate faster, which can mean safer switching of lanes, getting on to highways or being able to avoid things easier.
2. The battery pack makes for a very strong platform, means it is less likely a collision results in the interior of the car collapsing (i.e. less chance of another vehicle to essentially enter your passenger space)
3. No motor up front, means the whole front is a giant crumple zone, which means a lot less crushing of legs or other parts in an accident, as well as more space to absorb the force of impact (i.e. less forces transferred to passengers).
4. Batteries may be less likely to catch on fire then gas tanks in accidents (even if putting out battery fires may be especially challenging)
5. Lower center of gravity, means high speed maneuvers are less likely to result in loss of control or flipping over. Also means, even if someone hits you, you are less likely to spin out or lose control and can instead bring your vehicle safely to a stop.
6. Systems like Autopilot, for all their flaws, might result in more consistent and predictable driving which should be safer overall. Tesla's systems seem to encourage more use of these things as compared to other manufacturers systems, which is overall a good thing (I think).

So what are the downsides... well some idiots think that allowing the car to drive itself is a good idea and naturally the car comes upon circumstances where the system is not capable of handling properly and people die as a result. So basically, don't leave the driver seat if using autopilot or FSD and do pay attention. Really not that hard and is on you the driver.

Bottom line, there is little question that Tesla's are safer."

2021-04-19 08:58:57,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd love to see the data of collisions involving Tesla‚Äôs regarding cause of the incident. No matter how good of a driver you or your algorithm is, there are still shitty drivers that could cause a collision (hello, r/iditosincars). I would 100% believe that computer vision would help diminish collisions from distracted driving and or driver errors. Even my Subaru has cameras that help me with that. 

Also, Li battery fires are about to be a huge problem. I‚Äôm a huge proponent of EVs and alternative energies but safety concerns with Li batteries are very real. I‚Äôm excited to see advancements in battery tech actually being implemented (instead of being clickbait article titles)."

2021-04-19 08:42:57,wallstreetbets,"The issue with electric cars, in general, is if they go on fire, the fire departments aren't able to work with electric vehicles due to lack of training."
2021-04-19 08:26:03,wallstreetbets,Obviously its safer.  However you should be concerned about how safe it is.  If it becomes too safe.  Its only time before they ban driving completely and only people who take a rigorous class and exam will be allowed to operate a vehicle.
2021-04-19 09:49:12,wallstreetbets,"Tesla owners are a cult. They tend to overlook many faults even the autopilot features and talk themselves into thinking they are driving a car in beta phase. Everything they forgive Tesla is something that would not be acceptable in another car brand.

 Furthermore if youre in the car culture Elon Musk is no sweet heart he was a venture capitalist in the early days of Tesla. It was someone else idea dream vision of Tesla automotive all he did was invest in someone else idea. Eventually Tesla got popular and he wanted the attention so he paid of the brain ""father"" of Tesla full nda and then step forward in his place now he got the fame he so desired and people blow smoke up his ass like his this great visionary when all he did was bought someone else dream vision and rebranded his own."
2021-04-19 11:02:03,wallstreetbets,"I owned two different Teslas (one was sold), and I loved them both. Absolutely no issues ever.

2021-04-19 09:03:38,wallstreetbets,I'm more interested how often fatal accidents occur. Not only does Tesla have all this tech preventing you from getting in an accident in the first place they also have the highest safety ratings.

2021-04-19 13:50:21,wallstreetbets,Being in the collision repair industry no vehicle is safe that's why they are crash tested. If you can't get out of it after an accident then burn to death there is a major flaw in design. Yes let's have electric powered door mechanisms that when voltage is cut u r stuck in ur coffin.

1: The autoplot is only used on the highway. There you cover much more miles per accident.

2: There is no differentiation between other cars, which have an assistance system like autopilot, and which do not. I don't think Tesla with autopilot have less accidents than BMW or Mercedes with assistance systems.

3: The driver of a Tesla will be a better driver on average (not too young, not too old).

4: Sampling bias: autopilot usually turns off in complex situations (heavy traffic, narrow roads, road works...). However, this is exactly where statistically more accidents are likely to happen.

In addition, the sample of test drivers is far too small. Extreme values (in this case, extremely good values) occur more frequently. Using this statistic to compare the safety of cars is completely dubious. Anyone who understands a bit about empirical work will note that these figures say exactly nothing at all."

It ignores the root of accidents, just the end result. That's why its bullshit.

How many TESLA 4x4 flip due to wheel base issues due to aftermarket adjustments? 0...but that type of accident is included in the data. So if there are 40k rollovers a year, its ""free"" data padding for TESLA. Same goes for modified systems on street racing and the wrecks from those and a plethora of other issues that are specific to a select action or group of vehicle.

But, the motor vehicle safety figures put out each year also ignore the same nuances.

The only one point against Tesla is the weight of the car.  Because that affects how Tesla tunes the suspension and spring rates.  And the handling, the Model 3 is the only exception.

Just having the 1 pedal driving will reduce many incidentals.  Imagine during a corner you can progressively adjust the torque of the wheels just through modulating the pedal.  There‚Äôs no gear change or jerking from clutch or gear engagements.  The reaction time to slow just by releasing the pedal, while cars would have to release the accelerator and then depress the brake pedal.

Tesla was a game changer for me.  I was a petrolhead that loved driving manuals.  But now, I just look forward to what Tesla has to offer.  I did buy other cars after my Teslas but I daily drive the Teslas.  

If you look at all the accident photos, Teslas are known to be miraculous in survival rates.  There are always exceptions, but one thing I feel strongly is that if Tiger Wood was in a Model X he wouldn‚Äôt have sustained as much injuries as he did.  That‚Äôs just my opinion, because you asked ‚Äúfeel‚Äù."

The Autopilot helps with driving fatigue for longer distance drives, able to detect traffic past the car in front of you, and also the cars surroundings. It's extremely helpful for inclement weather.

If you honest with yourself about how you see and drive as a person you know we get distracted easily and any application of technology(like lane keeping and adaptive cruise) truly minimize the risk of crash leading to injury.  

So I‚Äôm a proponent of it being used.  Where it fails on every technology I‚Äôve benched marked is making an early decision versus just following the car in front.  Think about a long sweeping curve while following a car @60 mph.   You see brake light way ahead of car your following. But it continues at speed for next 1/2 miles and then breaks suddenly.  It‚Äôs a horrible user experience as a passenger when you have rapid deceleration.

**wait I misread that, in general teslas get in less accidents per miles driven but since driver assist has benn added there is an increasing number of accidents per mile driven.**

I swear it read 1 accident per 375,000 miles VS 1 per 475,000 for other cars. The article says 1 per 3.7 million miles. 

Original comment :

Another article had a similar conclusion in USA.

https://chartexchange.com/article/?id=282716

At the very end:

Last month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the automobile safety agency in the United States, said it was looking into a ""violent crash that occurred on March 11 in Detroit involving a Tesla and a tractor-trailer.""

The agency has in recent years formed Special Crash Investigation teams to look into Tesla crashes related to the vehicle's Autopilot system.

Tesla reports one accident for every 3.7 million miles driven while Autopilot is engaged. Over the past two years, the number of miles driven per accident, with the Autopilot on, has increased 18%. In comparison, the NHTSA reports one accident for about 475,000 miles driven for all U.S. vehicles.

Tesla cars are getting in more accidents compared to all vehicles. If they are safer in general that should be happening...

Would be interesting to compare them to other high performance sedans? Possible the ""theme"" of the car is a reason its higher than the average?

**Edit, wait I misread that, in general teslas get in less accidents per miles driven but since driver assist has benn added there is an increasing number of accidents per mile driven.**"

The overall death rate for an average, middle-aged shitbox is about 50 per million vehicle-years.  The overall death rate for a new Lexus is about 10.  

Similarly, the comparisons of those averages implies that the driver populations are the same, but Teslas are bought by fewer very young and very old drivers.  They‚Äôre less likely to be bought by people who travel on dangerous rural roads.  The driver demographics are very favorable for Tesla."

I was listening Lex Fridman, an AI scientist who worked at MIT, talk about the subject, an he essentially said that AI is bound to make a mistake while driving... It's just a matter of when and where.  

For example, when a pedestrian crosses the road, a human driver might speed up to assert their presence and prevent them from crossing. On the other hand, they might slow down and allow them to cross. However, What If the pedestrian began crossing the road without realizing that you are driving towards them? AI is not human, and it is difficult to make choices like this. You're pretty much relying on a robot to determine whether it should speed up or slow down to keep the pedestrian safe. These sort of situations are called ""tricky situations,"" where the driving solution may be too ambiguous for AI. Most of the time, it will make the right choice, but sometimes it will not.

MIT actually conducted a study where they had autonomous vehicles travel 300,000 miles. During this study, they determined that autopilot encountered a ""tricky situation"" every 9.2 miles.  

TL;DR: Autopilot essentially fails every 10 miles of driving, and humans need to remain vigilant during these moments to prevent the injury of themselves or others. (Not to discredit AI, but ppl seem to think that it's safer than it actually is)"

>Tesla reports one accident for every 3.7 million miles driven while Autopilot is engaged. Over the past two years, the number of miles driven per accident, with the Autopilot on, has increased 18%. In comparison, the NHTSA reports one accident for about 475,000 miles driven for all U.S. vehicles.

What this is saying is that you can expect 1 accident for every 3.7mil miles driven with autopilot engaged. They are reporting that the rate of accidents is decreasing when they say:

>number of miles driven per accident, with the Autopilot on, has increased 18%.

You can drive more miles and expect less accidents. This is an opposite viewpoint from the parent comment's article in German."
2021-04-19 13:32:03,wallstreetbets,What I would also be curious to know if that controls for the road conditions that autopilot is used for. Since I believe it is currently only useable at highway speeds it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to compare it to non autopilot accidents on city roads since separated interstate highways are inherently safer per mile driven.

Cruising on the freeway at 75mph and then it suddenly slams on the brakes when nothing is in front of it or to the side. Next day it did the same thing at the same exact spot/lane on the freeway. Next day I try the lane next to it, no issues. Autopilot for some reason registers that lane as a city street and decides it needs to slow down. Or the whole passing a trailer that's taking up the entire lane it decides it needs to veer off out of the lane to avoid a potential crash."

At least the world would be better off if you stuck with the gas tank in this situation.

Also, the Hulk doesn't exist. Extended door handles do not give you access to a locked car."

2021-04-19 17:00:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. The biggest problem with the media is that they're completely getting it wrong. The problem with batteries is not that they're  highly flammable and/or dangerous for the passengers, it's how they burn when they do catch fire."

You‚Äôre over-thinking my example."
2021-04-19 11:10:49,wallstreetbets,I'm fully on board with the future being autonomous vehicles. We are in a transitional stage though where the road infrastructure is not setup to accommodate autonomous vehicles. The tech can only be so good. My biggest concern is when you get into a construction zone  where the lines are all over the place or even a well worn road where the lines are not visible at all. In MN the signs often get covered in snow as well as lines. Will this stop some retard from trying to use full self driving? Nope
2021-04-19 11:15:53,wallstreetbets,"Show me a car that can navigate through a mile of construction where there are multiple lines on the road old and new. Show me where your tesla isnt going to follow a construction vehicle off the road into a ditch? None of this even takes into account snow on the ground. Let me guess your argument is ""not meant to be used in the snow""? Who is going to stop the next retard from trying it?"

2021-04-19 10:57:10,wallstreetbets,"The fire isn't more intense on a combustion vehicle. The vapor of gasoline is what can catch fire and can be extinguished relatively easily and has a shorter burn time than a battery does. Gasoline burns at 536 degrees while a lithium battery burns at 3600 degrees this is also no including all of the plastics burning in the car making it more intense in both cases.

If the car burning is in traffic with no where to go in that 10 minutes, the heat could expose other vehicles around the car as well."
2021-04-19 11:02:07,wallstreetbets,"Tesla Model S‚Äôs dont have a normal door handle that sticks out to grab. They retract, leaving a smooth surface. You‚Äôre stuck while the fire builds to a level life is no longer sustainable and the chance to exit is gone. The door handles trap occupants.

In a fire they often stay retracted, leaving no way for a passerby, occupants, or EMS to remove someone or themselves from a burning Tesla before it‚Äôs too late. 

Once that chance is gone, it‚Äôs a literal fireball. That‚Äôs a huge safety risk to anything nearby, first responders, everyone.

We can put out gasoline fires EASILY. Normal car doors don‚Äôt trap occupants. The battery tech needs advancement. That‚Äôs the safety difference. It‚Äôs not negligible.

Look at it this way, ice vehicles are designed to burn their fuel and produce emissions every time they are used.

You get why fire departments can‚Äôt keep up with all these changes though, right? Firefighters will never learn the ins and outs of each car, especially with brand new and apparently frequently changing tech. A FF isn‚Äôt going to see a burning Tesla and recognize the model and the fire safety issues specific to each model on top of fire safety issues, civilian and responder protocols etc. 

I have faith these issues will be ironed out...in time. Short term though-investors should realize the potentials for extremely bad press and wrongful death suits, etc effecting stock prices. I know, I know-this is WSB. I don‚Äôt say any of this to crap on Tesla as I love Tesla...but there are things to consider when investing, and knowledge brings power."
2021-04-19 10:29:59,wallstreetbets,If you can't understand the difference between full self drive and  full autonomous driving then maybe thats the reason you can't see the difference.  The fact you tried to start off with an insult was to deflect from the fact my post pointed out the difference that you are arguing doesn't exist.  If the buyer is too stupid or chooses not to pay attention to the difference that falls on the driver.  There are millions of things marketed and the marketing doesn't show the exact feature.  look at a hamburger shown in marketing and the one you get at the fast food restaurant.  They never look the same.  But most of us realize what marketing is.  It shows the product in the best possible light.

Forget showing something in the best possible light, it's not the fucking same at all.

In a couple years most of the OEMs will be featuring siriusxm similar to terrestrial radio.  I will not be surprised if the dealers will be offering siriusxm radio for 3 to 5 years as a standard part of the transaction.  

Let it make it clear.  I am not advocating sirius xm as a service but rather as a Business whose $1.668 B fcf in 2020 is 8 more than spotify's and probably more than all streamers combined.  For some reason, most folks associate the company with siriusxm radio only.  This was the case five years ago, and a huge mistake to think now.  Today, siriusxm owns Pandora, is the leading digital ads technology  thanks to AdsWizz and Simplecast, that just surpassed 1 B monthly downloads, owns about 15% of SoundCloud, and 100% of Stitcher, on of the top 4 podcasts in the country.  I expect the share price to double already this year with Q1 to be a blowout quarter.

Sirius xm is about the same price. I feel that the problem with sirius xm is that they don't allow you to add multiple cars and this is where the service becomes expensive. If they could somehow figure out a way to register every  vehicle in your home as a user with that service it would eliminate the high cost factor (ill be dammed if I'm paying 120x3 just to listen to a radio)

2021-04-19 10:52:52,wallstreetbets,Holy cow
2021-04-19 12:31:57,wallstreetbets,I own fancy cars with all these features (data connection and full voice assistant). Apple and Google just do it better. With CarPlay I have these same features in an upgradable device. I don't need to use my phone as my infotainment center is merged with my phone. CarPlay is literally one of the sections in my infotainment dash. The problem I have is that infotainment centers get dated quickly (they are often behind current technology due to the nature of car engineering timelines). I literally have Spotify/Apple Music/Messaging in my infotainment center right now with voice controls without having to pick up my phone.

In the not too distant future, always on internet connections, built in streaming options, voice control, and over the air software updates will all be standard features, as they have been on Tesla's for years.  It's a copycat industry, they will fall in line, and that airplay will become obsolete.  In the same way that tivo was revolutionary for a decade but quickly became obsolete with the rise of streamers, airplay and Sirius will follow suit.  It's not only much more convenient, but much safer too.  Many jurisdictions already fine you for any interaction with your phone will driving, with good reason"

Every argument you make for this is one that doesn't really make sense. CarPlay, as implemented, is literally what you are describing. It is the same fucking interaction as you are describing. Tell your car to play Spotify playlist ""Who gives a fuck"" is the same if I press a button on my steering wheel and my phone does it or my car does it. The two devices are functionally merged."
2021-04-19 12:56:23,wallstreetbets,"Wtf?  How do you not know that distracted driving is dangerous?  Also, you clearly don't understand, as I've been talking about how the Tesla model will be widely adapted within a few years in the industry and you keep bringing up objections that are not relevant to how a Tesla's infotainment system functions.  Besides, you still haven't told me why it's not stupid to introduce an intermediary device that only adds an extra layer of encoding/deciding to produce an audible sound.  It clearly makes no sense but you're dug into this really hard for some reason.  Obsolescence is fine and natural.  Don't fight it"
2021-04-19 13:11:38,wallstreetbets,"You are equally dug into your position. With my phone, I can use any app that supports CarPlay directly from the infotainment system. With Tesla model, I get to play that my apps are in the club. 

>How do you not know that distracted driving is dangerous? 

Are you illiterate? I keep saying it is in the freaking voice nav supported by CarPlay. I don't actually touch my phone. The Tesla version is a pretty distracting infotainment center, IMO."
2021-04-19 13:41:51,wallstreetbets,"Okay buddy, you win.  Makes total sense to introduce another link and an extra encoding.  That always only improves sound quality.  You are a top notch debater, and a formidable opponent, that much is true."

DFV FOR CEO"
2021-04-19 09:59:14,wallstreetbets,Better get my Application in early so
2021-04-19 08:24:23,wallstreetbets,"Hey /u/quantkim, thanks for the post! But according to the 8-K, doesn't it mean that he can step down on July 31 at the earliest?

Edit: The form says this, "" The Transition Agreement provides for Mr.¬†Sherman to step down as the Company‚Äôs President and Chief Executive Officer on the earliest of (i)¬†July 31, 2021, (ii) the effective date of the Company‚Äôs appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer or (iii)¬†the date his employment with the Company ceases due to his death, disability or termination by the Company without cause (such earliest date, the ‚ÄúSeparation Date‚Äù).""

So it appears that (i) he can step down himself by 7/31 if there is no replacement, (ii) he will step down if he is replaced (at any time), (iii) or his role will be replaced if he unfortunately passes/gets injured and is unable to work, or he is terminated.

A funny thing about this wording is that it doesn't use the Oxford Comma as I did, and can lead to a humorous reading: (iii)¬†the date his employment with the Company ceases due to his *death, disability or termination* by the Company without cause. This implies his death will be brought on by disability or by ""termination"" by the Company   ü§£ü§£ü§£"

If Sherman was really good then yeah this wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äògood news‚Äô but since the team can now be completed by Ryan Cohen, all pieces are in place to be successful..

Or who may bring a different set of skills that GameStop is looking for in their upcoming transition into the E-commerce market.

2021-04-19 08:27:11,wallstreetbets,Cohen is in a better strategic place as chairman of the board. He would be able to hire and fire CEOs as he pleases and would be able to steer broader conversations as to the direction of the company where a CEO would focus on the day to day operations.

2021-04-19 10:20:10,wallstreetbets,"Just my opinion, but I think it's a great thing to have a separate CEO and chairman.  As long as their vision for the company is the same you at least have someone playing devil's advocate to your ideas, while bringing ideas of their own to the table. Believe it or not diversity in ideals gets things done better."
2021-04-19 08:08:38,wallstreetbets,"This absolutely happens. They need to at least give the appearance of of running through due diligence for such an important position.

2021-04-19 18:57:07,wallstreetbets,"He could, but it would be missing a huge opportunity to have a sparring partner/someone with different perspectives and experiences for him to work with."
2021-04-19 07:47:33,wallstreetbets,If either get picked I'll put another 1k on gme
2021-04-19 08:37:43,wallstreetbets,Its funny how many people are speculating that Cohen will be CEO. üòÇ
2021-04-19 11:50:45,wallstreetbets,"I think at CEO level the question is often ‚ÄúI need you more than you need me, can we work together‚Äù, rather than ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an employer, you‚Äôre an employee these are our terms‚Äù"
2021-04-19 09:44:41,wallstreetbets,I guess what I was trying to say is they are not ‚Äútypical interviews‚Äù in the context of what 99% would be used to. The format would be quite different and would be much more of a conversation/meeting.

2021-04-19 14:11:12,wallstreetbets,I wish I could do that.  I would fire myself everyday around lunch time with a severance package and rehire me every morning with a sign-on bonus.

2021-04-19 14:19:42,wallstreetbets,Sounds like my Saturday night
2021-04-19 18:08:56,wallstreetbets,"So you're saying the key to an unlimited money hack is to become both ceo and chairman of a big company, with a large separation payout in your contract for each time you fire yourself?"
2021-04-19 07:48:02,wallstreetbets,"Sounds good, I'll copy you!"
2021-04-19 11:03:59,wallstreetbets,Plenty of company's have 1 person as chairman of the board and ceo.
2021-04-19 11:14:48,wallstreetbets,Before it was known he was elected as CEO he was a mere activist investor and talk was he would be maybe CEO.
2021-04-19 11:57:50,wallstreetbets,"Not my experience.  You might have a couple direct reports meet with a prospective CEO as part of the process, but it would largely be members of the board that interview a prospective CEO.  CEO reports to the board."

2021-04-19 10:08:53,wallstreetbets,"I am financially ruined (agricultural futures)

I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental ice cube futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with frozen water.  At first, demand soared around New Years and prices skyrocketed, but the ice cube bubble burst on April 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer parties, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of April 15th, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive ice cube shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early June, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the ice cubes in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. They are melting and I am ruined."

This thread is a complete mess now and is not what anyone wants. The worst part is that it was completely predictable and so easily avoidable.

I'm not going to agree with you that mass banning users is acceptable, but I do feel bad for all of you who feel that the sub is being taken from you. I very rarely ventured out of the GME megathreads, so I don't know if the situation was so unbearable before that the thread had to go. If the megathread was not enough to keep the rest of the sub livable I hope the mods find a better solution."

2021-04-19 13:14:34,wallstreetbets,Robinhood has the simplest/best UI for mobile for new users. Switch to real trading platform like Fidelity or TD once you get some experience
2021-04-19 13:15:40,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs cuz they‚Äôre in Spanish. Search for ESPY

2021-04-19 14:22:24,wallstreetbets,U have at least 100 shares right?
2021-04-19 14:23:13,wallstreetbets,Have you tried chatting with Fidelity about it
2021-04-19 14:24:23,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure On Webull it doesn‚Äôt take owned shares into the theoretical loss calculation either.
2021-04-19 14:26:50,wallstreetbets,Is it possible you have a limit sell order on your shares?
2021-04-19 14:29:42,wallstreetbets,It usually says that for me too until after the transaction but if I go into the options summary page it will tie up your 100 shares and the covered call together if they are on same account type
2021-04-19 14:32:32,wallstreetbets,I too use Fidelity.  As long as you have the shares you'll be fine.  Technically even with a covered call your losses are infinite because you lose whatever profit is above your strike price.
2021-04-19 14:46:54,wallstreetbets,"Also...don‚Äôt forget that an option is a contract for 100 shares. If you don‚Äôt have 100 shares, it‚Äôs not covered."

I know that GTA maker is a king but listen this. CDR till 20.12.2020 sold 13mln copys of CP77 (+/- 230zl each)

There was a lot of bugs so they made money back but no body know about this: money back was only for buyers who bought game before 14.12.2020 and there was only period time to get this money back 14.12 - 21.12.2020 if some1 bought it after doesnt count, if some1 came for money back after 21.12 - doesnt count.

Full year report will be on 22.04.2021. Why it is so important? Cuz they made so much money but I think it was only on the game, you should know that they have also fun shop. If you want buy all item just once It's: $2.9k!!!(80items, shirts, jackets, statues, backpacks etc.)

I'm just geussing How much money they made with game and how much with fun shop. If you will count only 13mln sold copys it looks like you get this net profit...

Our goverment is showing only shorts bigger than 0.5% of whole shares. I couldnt find other sides then this one on top with 34% of short interest.

When GME was at $420- CDR was with correlation and jumped from 250zl to 370zl -48%up

FUTURE

1. Plans for Witcher IV
2. Witcher III Remasterd (rtx technology)
3. Cyberpunk Online? There are rumors that they can have problems with that if they had problems with SingleP. - after GTA Online I think they smell there big chance. Even if you look only on visual shop how much money is in there.
4. Monster Slayer - Witcher as a ""Pokemon Go""
5. Digital Scapes - Vancouver studio, CDR bought them to grow and have more employees to work on 2 games AAA in same time
6. GOG.com - cdr games platform something like Epic Store, they are working very strongly on it to get 100% cash from selling own games and also for selling other dev. games.

SUMMARY

1. P/E = 15.41 worth to buy even without squeeze

2021-04-19 10:54:29,wallstreetbets,"All tiers of the European football system are based on a promotion/relegation system, so you have to earn your place in a competition, and once you're there, have to keep delivering performances to maintain it. Teams that have more money tend to win more often than not, but in theory, your local semi-pro team could eventually become European champions if they were well managed over a long period. And in reality, many former giant clubs have slid into irrelevance through poor management. This system is imperfect, but its ethos is central to the sport in Europe. 

For example, the most lucrative competition currently is the Champions League, which features the top teams from each of the domestic leagues in Europe. England has four spots, given to the top four finishers in the premier league. Currently, those teams include Leicester City and West Ham, and exclude Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal, and Tottenham. However, the proposed super league would permanently include those latter four teams and exclude the former two, regardless of their relative performances in a given season"

2021-04-19 07:57:58,wallstreetbets,"Better matches? You just get the same boring matches year in year out without any chance of relegation or a loss against a ""worse"" team. You will never see a club like Leicester become champions. You will never see Liverpool ruin a winning streak against Watford again. Every competition has these kind of stories. An ESL will be the most boring and least risky competition in the world."
2021-04-19 07:50:51,wallstreetbets,"Liverpool fan here. This is possibly the worst thing to happen to football. Born and raised in Liverpool, football means so damn much to myself and others in this city. Domestic league is the bread and butter, fighting for the title or as is the case this season, fighting for the top 4 for that chance of playing CL the following season against Europe's top clubs is what it's all about. There would be no excitement if this was a given, week-in week-out. They can advertise it as fighting against UEFA and FIFA but it has nothing to do with that. I would love to see all players and coaching staff go on strike over this, otherwise they as much a part of the problem. I can't hear You'll Never Walk Alone without tearing up, because it reminds me of what the club means to myself and others, but this proposal goes against everything that came before.

2021-04-19 14:03:14,wallstreetbets,"This is wrong. As a former soccer coach, the interest of the sport depends on the tenacity of the player and its availability to the player, which is relatively low in the US bc elite soccer clubs can cost players/parents serious money. It's a deterrent.

Soccer also fuckin brought North Koreans to the FIFA WC (i hope they aight tho). It as a sport alone has proven to bring people together across nations. I haven't yet seen this energy around any other sport, so it's unlikely that there's going to be a decrease in popularity unless SOMEONE makes an EXCLUSIVE league of the top grossing teams in Europe, leading to higher ticket costs and streaming paywalls."
2021-04-19 18:53:08,wallstreetbets,13 (so far) of the richest clubs in Europe want to form a league that 15 of the founders (out of 20) in the league can never be relegated from. It's basically an old boys 'fuck you I got mine' club.

2021-04-19 08:18:51,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure if the supporters of the clubs in this league actually support it either - anyway they should vote with their wallets and literally not watch or attend any games. Make these rich fucks lose money
2021-04-19 19:21:04,wallstreetbets,At least not attend Super League bullshit games.
2021-04-19 12:45:05,wallstreetbets,"No idea - stop watching ANY of their games, cancel all memberships and whenever crowds are allowed do not attend. Hurt them where it hurts (money)."
2021-04-19 08:04:56,wallstreetbets,"Because inherently, football is structured as relegation and promotion from different tiers and top tier gets to play in European champions league.

This competetion would eliminate the CL requirements and give a guaranteed berth instead.

That's terrible for the sport and is anti competetive. Especially football which is ingrained in European culture and was built by the very ground level workers who they're fucking over. 

The main appeal of football is the various races for title, promotion and CL spots. This NFL model is shit for that. 

Also, UK govt is rumoured to intervene and sanction all 12 clubs heavily. Boris Johnson and minister of culture are already talking about it. Calls are made for points to be docked and clubs be relegated from domestic leagues aswell.

The market will overreact (Manu shares high in premarket). And then they'd tank when they're fined. So, buy puts."
2021-04-19 08:02:22,wallstreetbets,"Fans want a meritocratic system where better teams are promoted or get into the biggest competitions and worse teams get demoted, which is currently the system in place.

This new system is in theory going to replace the champions League, which is a European competition played in mid week, where the best European teams of last year play against each other. In the new system, it will always be the same teams, no matter their performance, which undervalues success in national leagues. As an example, there are 32 teams who qualify each year for the main draw of the champions League, and in this system there are 12 teams announced who will always be part of this super League. Of those 12 teams, 3/4 have a genuine chance of not making it to the champions League next year (with a couple of them having close to a 0% chance)."

For the actuals fans I agree it seems like a terrible idea as fundamentally it creates seemingly a two tier system.

Before if you supported some low level league team, it was difficult but not impossible to have a good season and climb the ranks and even win the cup against the big boys.

This new league seems to make it so that only the best teams will be in that league. Everyone else is cut out of the game and money/glory. Doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense for fans to have a league where only a few teams can play."

England is probably getting eight teams since they are the best league. 32 teams get to the knockout round, up from the current 16, so essentially all you have to add is one extra playoffs round.

UEFA and FIFA just see a threat that can steal money from them so they are scared. I am a big football fan and I think this is a good idea because not only we can get the most out of top players and teams, but weaker teams can compete on there level.

The millions if not billions of fans of these clubs basically lose any remaining connection to their clubs as they become full on franchises with nothing tieing them to their fanbases, a lot of whom probably can't go to games anymore because who has the money to fly around Europe every week and pay exorbitant ticket prices to see the matches. The clubs lose any connection to their local community and it probably won't be long before they're playing matches in Dubai and China because it will make them more money. This is the culmination of the trend towards greed and money that football has been on for a while and the final nail in the coffin for the majority of people"
2021-04-19 11:10:29,wallstreetbets,"That makes more sense, Thanks. 

Let me ask you something though.
Are you surprised at the amount/quality of clubs doing this?

If yes, sometimes you gotta wonder maybe more is going on behind the scenes and they're not happy with the current situation maybe? I'm wondering if the new league has proposed other things (other than money) that has enticed them, because it's a significant number of teams to me."
2021-04-19 10:53:48,wallstreetbets,"OK I see.
You should write for the bbc news man. Well reasoned and informative. Go take a look at the junk articles and their ""reasons"".

I'm not sure if the money side makes sense because there is already insane money, so more insane money is just insane, like infinity x infinity = infinity.

Fans not being able to go - yes this is an issue absolutely. But also European fans of uk clubs get to see them too (obviously interchange uk for any country and you get the same effect multiplied) 

There's one thing I'd like explained - say the league is formed and Liverpool join. Why can't another Liverpool team be created to play in the other league? (i know it'll be potentially less of a team, at first. I've seen it happen in rugby league - the newly created teams from years back now kick the ass of the unbeatable teams, so competition is fierce! - also remember the six nations for rugby union? People were against Italy joining, then look, they eventually managed to beat a great top team last year)"
2021-04-19 11:21:32,wallstreetbets,It's purely based on money. What else could it be?
2021-04-19 11:26:36,wallstreetbets,"I'm not surprised by the audacity by the owners to do this.. I think they believe they are justified doing this since they own the club and can do anything they want with it basically..

Clubs like Bayern and Dortmund turned down the offer, and they are partly owned by the fans, which is something none of the clubs participating in esl is..

I think what this is is the owners can see a big opportunity to fatten their pockets, and don't care what supporters, players or managers think.. Mourinho got fired from Tottenham today because he stood up against the owners..

This is the rich elitist taking away clubs the working class has spent a hundred years to build, it is appalling, and no one wants this.. I am sure if you walk around the city of any of these clubs you will see grown men crying and in complete despair.. we love our clubs like we love our family and wifes, and this is basically announcing they are planning to kill what we love the most, and they are justified to do so because we are their slaves.. everyone cheering for the little man should be against this.. it is absolutely disgusting, and I can't put into words how damaging this will be to football, and how devistated I am

Another case of rich people taking away what the poor built to fatten their pockets.. the only ones gaining from this are the owners, and that's why they are doing this, because they benefit from it."
2021-04-19 11:07:52,wallstreetbets,"It's definitely possible another Liverpool team get formed, and there are already multiple other teams in   Liverpool that could ""take their place"" as it were, but it's just not that simple. Plenty of fans just won't be able to form the same connection they have with Liverpool, the new club won't have the same history and feeling. It happened last season when Bury went bankrupt and had to fold as a club, a phoenix club was formed but many of their fans didn't end up supporting them and a fair amount stopped watching football altogether. And any new club that is formed would have to start in probably the 9th tier at the highest, so it would be 8 years at least before they could play in the Premier league again, which wouldn't even mean that much anymore when they finally reached it because of the super league, and rising up the divisions isn't that simple, there's a good chance they never reach even the football league proper again.

As for your other points, yes the money in football is ridiculous, but at least within the Premier league other teams can compete, they can hold on to their top players and the likes of Leicester and West Ham are making strong pushes for Champions league football this season. That all disappears with the super league, the clubs in it would get well over ¬£300 million just for taking part, and since there's no relegation, that's a guarantee every year that no other club is getting. Any players not at super league clubs would want to move so they can play at the highest level, and even if a team does pull off a miracle and win the league, what does it matter? That's a second tier competition now.

And European fans of PL clubs being able to watch them is essentially a non-factor, especially considering every club in the super league is either English, Spanish or Italian. There just aren't many fans of English clubs in Spain or Italy, nor vice versa. Those few that there are nowhere near outweigh the number of fans in England that would near enough lose their club"
2021-04-19 11:27:28,wallstreetbets,"Come on my dude, critical thinking. Challenge the part of you that's uncomfortable with it.
If it's just money ok that's just a result of spoilt footballers making more than the people who actually deserve it (I'm thinking look at 2020 and where we'd be if money flow was different...)
If you keep saying it's money, that's narrow minded as the current football system is about money already."

2021-04-19 11:23:51,wallstreetbets,"You clearly know your shit and it's interesting reading. My view is far less extremely tilted towards new league.

What bothers me is the reasoning of using the fan's reactions to changes.
It shouldn't matter if football fans are finickety about club changes. You watch because you enjoy the game. I'm old now and most of the sports I watch have had literally all my favourite players and fighters retire and what's left is a totally different sport in some senses. I still support and watch because I'm not a childish football fan. I know that makes me a cunt for grouping many into that category but come on man, change should not be opposed so harshly, it reeks of corruption and greed too.
The mature thing is sit back and let it happen and enjoy all the extra matches on tv.
Since mma led to so many offshoots, I've found so many different styles to follow and enjoy even though on paper watching guys not hit each other in 'submission only' ebi invitationals has been awesome. Bellator feels substandard but I'll watch because i enjoy the sport in general.
If used your reasoning I'd be stuck being petty and being a ufc fanboy. I'd stop watching rugby or appreciating watching a shit team like HullKr grow over the years to be able to beat the old championship teams

Diversity should not be opposed
If it fails, fair enough!"

2021-04-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Options chain at a glance for SPY, QQQ and VXX going into the week Exactly what the title says. Plotting options data gives so much insight into why they are priced the way they are. If you're new to options these plots should make it really obvious why weeklies are like lotto tickets, and leaps are much more like owning the stock long term (with leverage).

I find it more helpful than a lot of broker tools, and plotting the actual data gives a quick visual representation of theta.

If your curious why these trends appear common for any ticker, it is because options are priced based on quantitative models (Black-Scholes, Bi-nomial...). The market-makers will price options based on based on well-understood underlying assumptions. 

Curves of VXX with strike are inversed relative to SPY and QQQ, which I find interesting. This would probably mean the longer time goes on, the higher the expectation volatility comes back up. The higher relative cost of for OTM strikes would indicate that when VIX does eventually spike again, people are betting it will spike quite high, and you pay a premium this insurance. 

With skyrocketing IV, sometimes things get out-of-wack. Meme stocks like GME and AMC have way overpriced OTM calls for example

2021-04-19 00:14:07,wallstreetbets,So there's are all basically implying that the whales are expecting extreme amounts of volatility right? Sorry I already ate all my crayons for breakfast and now need a banana to power my ape brain after lunch..
2021-04-19 12:03:35,wallstreetbets,"If I asked you where the VIX would be 1 year from now, you'd have no clue. Your best guess is the historical average volatility, which is around 20. That's exactly how market makers price as well, since VIX is generally fairly mean reverting. Of course equities are not mean reverting at all. During periods of elevated volatility like most of last year, expectations of future vol was downwards, so the futures were in backwardation ie. the expectation for the entire of last year was that future volatility would be lower. Right now VIX is at 17 so the VIX futures are back in contango.

Regarding your question about SPX/SPY/QQQ skews vs. VIX/VXX skews, it's because SPX and VIX are strongly negatively correlated. Almost all equity indices have a strong negative skew for 2 reasons.

1. People are willing to pay a lot of money for downside protection.

2. If an equity index goes up, volatility tends to drop. If an equity index goes down, volatility tends to rise. Of course it depends how the index gets there, but volatility at a strike is roughly priced at what market makers expect volatility to be if the index actually reaches that price.

If VIX had the same negative skew as SPX, you could statistically arbitrage the 2 by selling SPX puts + buying VIX calls and buying SPX calls + selling VIX puts."

2021-04-19 12:22:03,wallstreetbets,"It makes perfect sense. For the same reason that far out of the money puts have higher IV, calls on VIX are more expensive. I plotted the volatility skew as well. I just wanted to keep it simple for this post.

Straddles and strangles for example are both used when you expect a lot of volatility and aren't sure if itll move up or down.  buy a call and a put at the same strike price with the same expiration and the only way you aren't in the money is if the stock trades sideways.  

Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, I'm a fucking retard for sure, but you don't always have to know exactly what a stock is going to do to profit from options and significantly minimize risk/loss."

2021-04-19 12:33:42,wallstreetbets,"Yes, equity price movements do not follow a normal distribution.

The higher IV at extreme prices is to do with expectation of volatility if an extreme price is reached. If SPX crashes to 3000 within the next 3 months I can comfortably say that VIX will be over 50, while if SPX stays goes down to 4000 the VIX will probably be a little higher, but probably still similar levels. Thats why the SPX puts at 3000 have an insanely high IV whereas an SPX put at 4000 is probably 20 ish IV. Once again it highly depends on *how* the indices reach those prices, but the prices take that into account"

2021-04-19 12:22:24,wallstreetbets,"The ETFs do not track the VIX and do not claim to. Its physically impossible to replicate the spot VIX using derivatives. The ETFs track a VIX futures index with a specified average time to maturity.

VXX tracks a VIX futures index with a weighted average of 1 month to maturity. If the near-month VIX future expires 10 days from now and the far-month VIX future expires 40 days from now, the ETF would hold 33.3% near-month VIX futures and 66.7% far-month VIX futures to achieve the weighted average TTM. At the end of the day, there would be 9 days left on the near-month and 39 days left on the far-month. The ETF would then do its daily rebalance by rolling 3.3% of the near-month VIX futures to the far-month VIX futures (and end up with 30% near-month, 70% far-month) to maintain the correct weighted average TTM.

Spot VIX is a derived index that comes from taking the prices of a shitload of options. The VIX future is a contract that expires on the print of spot VIX on the expiry date of the future. That's why spot VIX can fly up but the VIX future may barely move if market participants don't expect VIX to stay this high by the future expiry.

This is of course nothing like the SPY basket vs. the ES future where it's arbitragable. There is no arbitrage between spot VIX and VIX futures, they are 2 very different things.

So yes, when spot VIX goes up 7% but VXX only goes up 5%, it's not a scam. The ETFs are doing exactly what they are intended to do."

2021-04-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD: Boomer Edition - CSX earnings this week For this week's Boomer Dick and Dividends we look once again at üöÇüöÇChoo Choo!  No one knows what the fuck is going on with CLOV hard to tell with that ticker if they are selling healthcare or some other clever name for weed stonks anyway.  RIDE bombed out of their Desert race so EVs that aren't Tesla are going to remain fucked because it seems like new millennial mechanics can't figure out how to actually use a DC motor after hyping it for over a decade. (Hint: Plug in motor = ‚è©‚è©) 

CSX is set for earnings this week and they will almost certainly beat expectations.

Why?  Well there is a handy tool to track rail traffic for CSX available on their own site to track performance metrics which includes the number of rail cars online at any given time.

https://www.csx.com/index.cfm/customers/performance-measures/

If you download the data it shows that the number of cars online hasn't been this high since 2018 (so not just beating out the pandemic numbers but smashing 2019 as well).  Previous years had much higher numbers but CSX did major efficiency cuts in 2017 that removed thousands of employees and areas that weren't running well.  (You can also see in the data velocity in 2017 was 14.7mph and is now 20mph).  

The short of it is that rail traffic appears to be up about 17% (technically it is 17% more cars online at a given time) while earnings estimates are pegging it at a 7% increase.

(Example of earning estimate stating this just recently https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-report-q1-earnings-low-155803201.html)

On top of that the the rail cost index was near an all time high in Q1 (https://www.aar.org/rail-cost-indexes/) which means that prices on rail freight were UP UP UP.  So they are moving more üöÇand charging üíµüí∞.  If you looks at earnings estimates regardless of the firm everyone seems to be pegging them at a slight increase from 2020 when the 17% increase was a sharp and almost immediate change on the year.  

If you need further confirmation from a non-CSX source the AAR also confirms that traffic is back to prepandemic levels of you remove the february blip from the Texas freeze.  CSX doesn't operate any lines in Texas so it is reasonable to assume that they weren't majorly impacted as their own data displays. https://www.aar.org/data-center/rail-traffic-data/

To top it off there is not a single part of the transportation industry that isn't struggling to meet demand right now.  CSX isn't going to be a magical exception and just have small growth when they have major lines throughout the major manufacturing centers of the Eastern US.  You can bet that they are doing it with less employees due to across the board labor shortages (listed as a concern in their annual report) and with an increasingly energy efficient line of üöÇ since they have been investing in and showing upgrades for years.

Pros: 

CSX is a profit heavy industry with government support that consistently out paces SPY as a long term investment even if you ignore the 1% per year dividend.

CSX is going to beat earnings because earnings were assuming moderate recovery vs the explosive recovery we got.  Almost no reason to doubt this and no reason to doubt they continue to do well throughout the year because as you can see in sky rocketing commodities pricing we simply cannot meat the demand for materials right now.  üöÇ Are much üí™ vs tiny üöõ when it comes to moving things like wood, steel and copper across the nation to be processed.

CSX didn't get hit by the Texas shutdown as they are an east coast outlet.  This means they will look better than several competitors with lines closer to or inside of Texas

CSX like all the major railroads prints money with a 27%ish profit margin year to year.  Railroads are a lifeblood to American supply lines that tend to do alright even in bad years.  Government support and regulations keep the industry wide stability and growth in place with more and more companies realizing that rail is the ideal way to move bulk goods when you have smart systems to plan around the delivery dates.  As long as Tony Musk and Tim üçè don't start shooting our goods down üß≤ tubes soon railroads are going to be good for a while.  

Cons: Good earnings reports don't always mean good stock prices üòïüôÉ.  Lots of unexpected things can come up and sometimes the stock gets bought up leading to the report and then dumped.  (Stonks did not like the last report but it also wasn't really that good).  $CSX did show very strong and steady growth after the last report so the real question is if there is a drop off on the report or not.  I lean towards no dip but it would suck to buy now and miss the dip since the last one was $10 drop üòïüöÇüí•.  

Time based Efficiency metrics are down a bit for Q1.  Trains are slightly slower and dwell times at stations are slightly longer.  Mostly labor based but it's still an issue for the slowest form of transit to move slower (note that vs 4 years ago they are 30%+ better).

Boomer Points:. 
üöÇ Are an amazing and under appreciated form of transportation.  They are incredibly üëï so the Democrats currently in power love them and they are big tough machines so Republicans tend to love them too!  It's vastly agreed upon that is long as you are a properly üíâ citizen that you will almost certainly love üöÇ and the way they follow simple patterns too!  üíâüíâüíâüíâ‚¨ÜÔ∏èüÜô‚è´=üöÇüöÇüöÇüöÇ‚è´üÜô‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Dividends: Essentially comes out to about 1% of the stock price per year if you hold it that long.  More or less free growth on something already beating SPY YOY.

Positions: I don't have any üòï.  Just saw this coming weeks earning notice has CSX.  Looked and saw it didn't appear to have a pre-earnings spike and decided that the rail data should probably show increased traffic since my companies rail cars keep getting stuck in station traffic.  The data shows a 17% increase in traffic and now I wish I had $CSX but I can't buy it til tomorrow.

Recommendations: Worst case scenario is probably that earnings randomly tank it for no good reason.  Last time it took a month to recover on bad earnings so if you aren't going to do shares then buy a call that ends a month from now.  No puts.  üöÇüí•üåàüêª"

This DD is about it beating earning well above projection and figuring out what that means.  The only problem is the stonk sometimes goes down with small positives in earnings so I can't guarantee a short call works in an irrational market.  I can say with confidence it is a good buy for a long call or just getting shares.

  I don't think there will be a dip this time but honestly getting another irrational 10% dip on CSX would be amazing."
2021-04-18 22:04:48,wallstreetbets,Not necessarily.  I think you could still get a nice return if you get in right after earnings - the stock tends to drop right after and then work its way back up.
2021-04-18 21:40:46,wallstreetbets,SPY is up 24% from Pre COVID.  Railroads definitely aren't as good as index funds for tracking the economy but they are pretty close trackers.  So the question is if you think the market might crash.   At which point just start buying puts or inverse funds.

2021-04-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TSP (TuSimple, autonomous truck tech that IPOd this week) is a scam -- DD inside This isn't investment advice and I'm not making any claims that **TuSimple is a fucking scam**, I'm just a retard.

From TuSimple's [S1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1823593/000119312521091150/d909743ds1.htm):

> Hallmarks of our proprietary semi-truck specific technology include our 1,000 meter perception range, 35 second planning horizon, high definition (‚ÄúHD‚Äù) maps with accuracy within five centimeters, and an integrated L4 autonomous semi-truck design comprising of a fully redundant sensor suite and components.

In the world of autonomous driving, L4 is the point of full automation and a human isn't needed in the vehicle at all. And technology with a 1,000 meter range doesn't exist (the 35 second ""planning horizon"" is a direct result of the range - it's the amount of time to react at highway speeds).

This article [discusses TuSimple's gear setup](https://www.laserfocusworld.com/test-measurement/article/14197547/autonomous-vehicle-technology-shifts-to-a-more-realistic-gear):

> TuSimple equips its trucks with 10 high-definition cameras that can identify vehicles up to 1000 m away (day or night, rain or shine), giving them plenty of room to steer around other vehicles or stop when needed (see Fig. 1). Five microwave radars can detect and identify objects up to 300 m away, important if fog or rain impairs vision. A pair of lidars with 200 m range give detailed views of objects inside that range.

Let's go over that again:

 * LiDAR range - 200 meters

 * Microwave radar range - 300 meters

 * **Magical HD cameras that claim to be able to identify vehicles 1,000 meters away - are you fucking kidding me?** I can't link to YouTube, but find the video ""TuSimple's Delivers Enhanced Night Vision Capabilities with New Camera System"" and you'll see that TuSimple's supposed ""improved"" camera is actually less clear, it's just better with headlight glare, and sure as fuck doesn't have a 1,000 meter range

They claim their technology can see [up to 1,000 meters away - triple the range of any competitor](https://www.tusimple.com/technology/), but they outsource all of their hardware and nothing on the market comes close to 1,000 meters. 

> Aeva Inc, a firm founded by former Apple Inc engineers to supply a key self-driving car sensor, said on Tuesday it had reached a deal to [supply the sensors for self-driving heavy duty trucks being developed by TuSimple](https://www.reuters.com/article/aeva-tusimple-idUKL1N2K102G)

Oh, and when TuSimple [tried to demonstrate how awesome its autonomous driving system is, it failed](https://www.wired.com/story/tusimple-self-driving-truck-cameras-computer-vision/):

> The demo drive also, however, makes clear there‚Äôs work to be done. After 40 minutes of, uneventful robo-driving, a computer voice interrupts our conversation: ‚ÄúAutonomous driving off.‚Äù Without my noticing it, the safety driver has retaken control. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a freeze on my visual,‚Äù he tells Hou. ‚ÄúI shut it down for safety.‚Äù A network card in that server box next to me disconnected, likely due to the truck's vibration, freezing the system's human-machine interface and blocking the bit that does the motion planning from the bit that executes its commands.

> And so this flesh-and-bones human holds the wheel and works the pedals for the next 20 minutes, taking us off the highway and back to TuSimple‚Äôs garage. 

TuSimple hasn't sold any of their technology. [Their revenues are from traditional trucking](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tusimple-ipo-filing-shows-self-driving-trucks-still-a-money-loser-11616535572?mod=searchresults_pos4&page=1):

> TuSimple has so far earned money as a traditional freight-hauler, not from selling its self-driving technology ready in 2024. It has customer reservations for more than 5,700 trucks, although those aren‚Äôt equivalent to sales revenue.

**TL;DR - $TSP claims to have self-driving technology that has three times the range of anything on the market, but haven't demonstrated it, or sold it, and the equipment they currently use is from other manufacturers. They have 70 trucks (50 in the U.S., 20 in Europe and Asia) on the road making normal freight deliveries, with ""safety drivers"" in the vehicles, and that's where their revenues are generated.**"

2021-04-19 11:35:04,wallstreetbets,"I like your analysis, the company is probably overpromising on its technology. But as a short seller it scares the hell out of me that the world total accessible market (TAM) for this industry is somewhere between 0.5-2.5 Trillion in revenue. The 9B valuation right now seems large but it only prices them in for capturing a small fraction of this TAM, about 1-5% depending on your assumptions of the global market and if they sell the whole truck or just the autonomous hardware/software. I have no doubt investors will fund this company in the short term given this potential market size. You could be riding this short position for a very long time before it becomes obvious that the tech wont work or competitors have developed better. And during that whole time this company has a good chance of figuring out the tech and improving its product. For me its a pass."

2021-04-19 05:08:36,wallstreetbets,"So I work for McLane Foodservice here in Houston, Tx and we were suppose to pick up Jack in the Box this summer. Due to us closing a deal with Whataburger, those JIB plans have been scrapped temporarily. What we were planning to do was send a empty trailer from Houston to Dallas and have a full load of JIB shuttled back to be distributed around the Houston area. We have done this in the past with companies such as Arby's and Panda Express. Multiple trailers go up empty while swapping trailers and coming back with 40k lbs of food product to be delivered.

Ok, so now that I got that out of the way. McLane Foodservice is one of Berkishire Hathaways holdings. Been around since the year 1906, family owned until Sam Walton bought it and the old owner bought the Astros. (not important) Sam Walton eventually sold after Pepsi, AmeriServ, PFS, and Finally Berkshire. (might not be 100% accurate on timeline of ownership)

Recently, McLane invested in Orange EV yard trucks (bobtails that move trailers around the parking lot and docked into building doors to be loaded) at some of their locations. As of January/February I was having a discussion with our director of operations and he said that we would not be hiring any extra drivers when we take on JIB this summer and trailers would be shuttled using the driverless technology in these trucks by AEVA.

Now, it was cool to hear that but at the same time it was hard to believe that we would be incorporating a technology that hasn't even been figured out in mainstream automobiles to be 100% safe and we are expecting this company to have figured it out in Semi-Trucks. The technology would drive the truck from the Distribution Center in Dallas to the Distribution Center in Houston all the way to the entrance gate before a driver on location takes over.

Since we have scrapped the JIB plans for now, I don't know much more about what is happening with this technology but it all started from what is going on with our DC is Arizona. I was told they are or have been using this in Phoenix with this driverless technology. I think that once phones are mandatory, and everyone has starlink type internet connection as well as road ratings (driverless % ratings of auto-piolet disablement) with quick updates to construction through city contracts and policys, this will still not be 100%. People need to be connected to driverless automobiles and I think mandatory phones are a solution. Highway use may be a different story but like what just happened not to far from where I live in The Woodlands, Texas, that Tesla Car Crash is a concern because the technology didn't respond.

Public (Stock) Companies we also use daily are Trimble, VMWare, Zebra, Volvo Trucks, Freightliner trucks. We service Yum Foods (Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut), Chilies, Applebee's, IHOP, Whataburger, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chick Fil-A, Golden Coral, and others. Our grocery division has contracts with Walgreens as well. We are nation wide and that's what landed us the distribution contract with Whataburger.

Our Delivery Drivers make 65-100k+ a year and we are always hiring. 4 day work weeks but you can work more if you want more $. If you or anyone you know that has a CDL, is mentally tough, and has a good attitude but kinda edgy, please make them aware as job openings are ramping up and we want to help employ people that want to work at McLane.

# Introduction

Hey, it's your girl Dry-Drink. Was a WSBs lurker for years, used to be that this site was about smart but risky DDs, and ballsy bets with good potential. Who can forget the legendary thesmd AMD updates from 2019? But now it seems we pride ourselves on being retards who lose money for a living with options we don't understand. What happened to us? Here's to bringing back some old-school circa 2017 WSBs.

I've [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa_leverage_margin_and_proper_diversification/) a few [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kspobo/true_wsb_leveraged_portfolio_continues_to_deliver/) about this [portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mt0ec3/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_update_now_up_350k_108/) and strategy. I've gotten a lot of questions as to how it works and how to implement it so I've put together my definitive guide on this. From here on out, I'll just post updates of the portfolio performance periodically. I don't have a TLDR, unfortunately if you're interested in implementing this, you will have to read through this short guide. It's not super complicated once you get it, I promise.

# Glossary

Compensated vs Uncompensated Risk: The market rewards you for some risks, specifically the ones that cannot be diversified away (like overall market risk, or the risk of value companies). The market does not reward you with a return for taking on risks that can be diversified away. In other words, no one is paying you money for betting the farm on one stock.

[Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) Criterion: The percent of your account to invest in a risky asset to have maximum compound returns. For stocks, the Kelly Criterion is given by the formula [Sharpe/Volatility](https://www.cashchronicles.com/2019/05/20/the-kelly-investment-criteria-and-optimal-leverage/). So for stocks, maximum compound return (Kelly bet) is around 0.4/20% = **200%** (that is, you borrow as much money as you have, to buy twice as much in stocks as you otherwise could, by using leverage).

Margin Call: When your account equity is too low versus the stocks you hold, your broker can force you to sell stocks with a margin call. In other words, if your leverage is too high, the broker will de-leverage you automatically.

Portfolio Margin (PM): A margin account that determines margin maintenance with risk models instead of set leverage targets. It will typically allow greater leverage (**not that you should use more leverage than I say later)** and, most importantly, will let you [sell SPX boxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) for cheap borrowing with no effect on the margin maintenance.

Smart-beta: Catch-all term for equity indices or ETFs that are not market-cap weighted, but actually tilt towards additional sources of stock compensated risks (value, momentum and quality being the big three). Because these added risk sources are uncorrelated with the market, they lead to portfolios with higher returns and lower risk

# Background

For maximum compound growth, you want two things: Only take risk that compensate you, and take as much as it is optimal for max returns (Kelly bet size). In this post, I am going to show you the portfolio that has the theoretically highest compound return. History confirms this portfolio works, but don't invest in this because it worked well in the past or my updates. That the theory is well-supported in historical returns and practice is just the cherry on top.

Big-picture, the portfolio can be set up as follows:

1. Buy a globally-diversified portfolio of smart-beta ETFs (a lot of value, quality and momentum firms). You want country, currency and sector diversification to make sure you diversify away as much of the risk you don't get paid for and only take on compensated, equity risk. Using smart-beta further increases returns.
2. Leverage the portfolio to the optimal, mathematical number that produces highest returns (about 2:1 leverage). That is, borrow on margin to borrow twice as many shares as you otherwise could.
3. \- Bonus) [Sell SPX boxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fehabt/box_spread_financing_for_extremely_cheap_085/) to get dirt-cheap financing rates for your leverage (\~0.5% borrowing rate, instead of Interactive Brokers 1.6% margin rate). This is not required, the most important part is the actual portfolio and level of leverage (steps 1 and 2). This is just a cheaper way to borrow.

**Note:** This is NOT riskless. On the contrary, this is a high-risk strategy, with plenty of financial risk. You can lose money and A LOT of money in the short/medium and, heck, even long-term. It would've lost about 83% during 2008 GFC, even more during the Great Depression. But eventually, it has and should come out ahead. All I'm saying is that it is the highest amount of risk that you would rationally take with a portfolio and hence, will have the highest average, expected, compound return. Taking any less risk (less leverage) should result in lower compound returns, that's logical. And taking any more risk (more leverage) also leads to lower compound returns (that's what the Kelly Criterion proves).

# Benefits

1. No position on volatility or downside protection (aka ""theta gang immune"").
2. Only takes on compensated risk. Better global diversification and access to smart-beta products than you otherwise could with options and futures.
3. Extremely tax efficient. It borrows as cheaply as you could with options and futures, but gains all stay unrealized.
4. Much more protected from short-term movements (you don't lose 30% just because your favorite stock missed earnings).

# Audience

The portfolio has the highest expected compound growth from index investing and requires little active management (no individual stocks or trying to time a trend). **Hence, it is ideal as a base WSB portfolio.** If you believe you can consistently trade for a living, that's great! You should probably ignore this post. But if you've lost enough money to feel like the market is a casino, here's a portfolio where you can let your money simmer and earn high returns before you decide on your next YOLO. I personally only use this; every time I have more money to invest, I just direct it into this portfolio.

# My Portfolio

I opened a Portfolio margin account at Interactive Brokers. You need >$100K for this (see below for smaller-account alternatives) I use a 60% USA, 25% Developed Market, 15% Emerging market split, all with low-cost, smart-beta stock ETFs. I've posted my portfolio on each of my updates but here it is once more. Again, just a bunch of stock ETFs that use smart-beta methodology, have low costs, and diversify globally. Feel free to use the same ones. I especially like Vanguard Multifactor fund (VFMF), the Schwab Fundamental funds (like FNDC) and the iShares multifactor funds (like EMGF). If you want something simple, a portfolio like:

30% VFMF

30% VTI

15% FNDF

10% ISCF

7% FNDE

8% EMGF

Is very close to what I use. Or feel free to copy my exact weights below. You'll see different positions because I tax-loss harvested back in March 2020.

[Current Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/rb14mo0640u61.png?width=2952&format=png&auto=webp&s=a242fe349528291cc664942edcacba378ef011f8)

So far, I am up \~108% annualized since June 2020 but, again, do NOT do this just because it worked well in the past. Do it because you understand and agree with the theory. I plan to do this for decades. I recommend you use Interactive Brokers due to their low margin rates. Although if you'll sell SPX boxes to avoid the margin rates, you could do it anywhere that offers portfolio margin (ex: TDA).

# Managing the Portfolio

You opened a Portfolio Margin account, bought twice as much in stocks as you had money for (using your ideal ETFs in the weights shown above, or the ones I use) and even sold SPX boxes to get rid of your negative cash balance to borrow cheaply. What to do now?

As the market rises, your equity will grow and your leverage (as a percent of the account) will drop. So it is vital you re-leverage further (borrow more against your bigger account) and buy more stocks to get back up to 2:1 leverage. If markets drop in value, you'll do the opposite: control your risk by selling some positions, paying off some of the debt, and bringing leverage back down. This is KEY towards avoiding actual deep, nearly-100% losses and to obtain the highest compound return. Just like boomers rebalance their 50/50 stock/bond Vanguard portfolios back to 50/50 if it gets out of line, so should you keep your portfolio at roughly 2:1 leverage. And no, it's not ""buying high, selling low"". You can't time the markets, so just stay disciplined and rebalance. This portfolio has the highest compound return **despite** having to sell somewhat during down markets. To minimize transaction costs and the cost of weekly whipsaws, I recommend you sell and decrease leverage if your leverage is higher than 2.2x, and buy more stocks by borrowing/re-leveraging back up if your leverage is lower than 1.8x. These are the **rebalancing bands**.

When you sell positions to deleverage, you would want to either keep the additional cash as collateral until the next SPX box expires, or just buy back a box. I recommend selling boxes in the near future (3-12 months) so you're always decently close to an expiring box, or a box so close to expiry that buying it back would entail very low spreads. BTW, when a box expires, you don't have to do anything. It is cash-settled automatically.

If you ever add money into this account, just invest it in such a way to get close to that 2:1 leverage. So if leverage was less than 2:1, you'd buy stocks with your added cash+more borrowing, if leverage was higher maybe you just keep it in cash/ST bond fund like ICSH/buy back a box spread. Play it by ear in your specific circumstance, just make sure your leverage stays within the rebalancing bands.

# Timing the Market

It is reasonable to let leverage rise a bit past 2.2x if markets are quite cheap because they've dropped in value (like in March 2020). It also is reasonable to let leverage drift down if markets are at ATHs (see my current portfolio is only about 1.75:1 leverage right now). The Kelly Criterion is clear that you'd want to leverage past 2:1 if the equity risk premium is abnormally high and vice-versa, so it makes sense. Don't do A LOT of that but a little bit of opportunistic market-timing (I call it ""delayed rebalancing"" when stocks are either real cheap or real expensive) is likely warranted.

# Looking Forward

No, you're not late to the party. Obviously, it would've been better to start a portfolio like this back in June 2020 when I first posted about it but hindsight is 20/20. This strategy does not require timing the markets; today is still a good time to start. Even today, stocks are decently priced, especially if using smart-beta. I expect this leveraged portfolio to have a return going forward of about 13% average annualized. Obviously, what you'll actually get short-term might be much more or much less but if you diligently stick to it, that would be the average return I expect. This is about three times as high as I expect for the very-expensive S&P500 (because of the 2:1 leverage, the international exposure and the smart beta vs the S&P 500 at a nosebleed valuation level of 37 Shiller CAPE 10).

# FAQs

\- Account minimum to start?

Ideally, you start with $100K (somewhat more is preferable to give you a cushion over the $100K barrier) and a portfolio margin account. Otherwise, you can just use regular margin and pay the slightly higher borrowing cost. I probably wouldn't bother if I had less than $20K, but if you have $50K or more, I'd say go for it.

\- What if I get margin called?

If you follow the strategy as you should (selling positions if losses mount, to pay back the debt and keep the leverage around 2:1) then you should never actually get to a position where your leverage is so high, your broker is liquidating you themselves. So you should never get an actual margin call.

\- What about using Leveraged ETFs (ex: SPUU)?

Those have high management fees, sometimes have too much leverage (ex: UPRO), will not let you diversify globally as effectively, there are no smart-beta options and they rebalance daily (instead of using the 1.8-2.2 leverage bands I recommend). IMO, it's better to rebalance a little less frequently than daily (this is what using bands accomplishes).

\- Where can I learn more about this? How did YOU learn it?

Unfortunately, I don't actually have a good resource for you. I've learned a lot about smart-beta, leverage, the Kelly Criterion and these topics to know what I'm doing here but it has been from a bunch of different sources. I hope this is enough to get you started though.

\- Why not more leverage for more returns?

Don't leverage more than this. Leveraging further leads to **overbetting (a condition where you're past the Kelly Criterion).** Any more leverage than that, and your portfolio risk goes up and your return goes down. Don't be a Bill Hwang and blow up with margin calls. Be disciplined, rebalance, keep leverage around 2:1, and let the portfolio do its magic.

\- Doesn't this only work during Bull markets?

This is the opposite of the above FAQ since it implies I'm using too much leverage. This is the theoretically highest compound returning portfolio **given** the risk of stocks (i.e. including both bear and bull markets). Obviously, in bull markets, it will perform amazingly (like now). And portfolios with even more leverage will be even better. During Bear markets, it will perform worse than not using leverage (and portfolios with more leverage will do far worse). Since I can't time the market or know when good or bad periods will come, I just use the optimal leverage a long-term portfolio would need for max returns. That's 2:1.

\- This sounds like the famous Hedgefundie UPRO/TMF portfolio no?

I personally think that portfolio has multiple problems (the LETFs themselves, the risk parity weights do not lead to max sharpe, even if it were max sharpe, I'm aiming for max compound growth not max Sharpe, and the leverage of 3x is just about past the Kelly Criterion). [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk71rt/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_still_going_bonkers_up/gtwe5p4/?context=3) a chain of comments where I dig into the math I used to come to these personal conclusions.

\- Doesn't this lose money during Bear markets? If you use 2:1 leverage, shouldn't it have been wiped out during the GFC (stocks dropped more than 50% then)?

It loses a ton of money during Bear markets (about 65% personally this past March, much more in historical backtests that include events like the Great Depression). I didn't say it was riskless, only that it had the highest compound return long-term than any other strategy that invests more or less in stocks. The reason it doesn't get fully wiped out is precisely because you sell positions every time your leverage rises past 2.2x, to get leverage back in line. This is crucial. Otherwise, a simple market drop of 50% over any amount of time will fully liquidate you (compound return of -100%, the exact opposite of what we're aiming for).

\- Can I do better if I add non-stock assets, or use dma200, or etc?

Probably, but not by much. The main issue is that assets like commodities and bonds are so tax inefficient and I don't estimate high-enough returns for them to warrant them. That said, if you're optimistic-enough about them, add them, recalculate your Kelly Criterion, and leverage accordingly. Ditto for any other strategy like dma200; if I felt confident about them, I would add them so if you do, then add them, that's totally fine!

\- Why do you only show returns since June?

Been doing this for a few years but only have computed data from Interactive Brokers since June. Before that, I used other brokers and it would be a pain to try to compute my personal overall returns. If you don't believe I got through Dec 2018 or March 2020, then I can't really do much for you. [Here's a backtest](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=5&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=true&portfolioName1=2%3A1+Leveraged+S%26P+500&portfolioName2=S%26P+500&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VFINX&allocation1_1=200&allocation1_2=100&symbol2=CASHX&allocation2_1=-100) since 1985 showing it wouldn't have blown up, even during 2008, (though the drawdowns can be deep, again, there's risk!) and does outperform eventually as theory would say. 

\- Well, I invested in X stock and got much higher returns!

Good for you (srs)! If I knew what stocks to pick to make a lot of money, I would just do that. But I have no clue, so I'm just investing in a few sources of high risk/returns, diversify away all risk I don't get paid for and leverage to the maximum compound return.

\- This doesn't belong in WSBs, why are you posting it?

I thought a 2:1 smart-beta leveraged stock portfolio, funded with SPX boxes, would be the kind of portfolio WSBs would appreciate. If it's boring, I get it, I'll just post gain/loss porn from here on out any ways.

2021-04-18 20:14:42,wallstreetbets,This is the high quality DD I was hoping WSB would return to. Thank you for posting. Is there any particular reason why you would have more in a domestic ETF vs an emerging market? Would sector rotation factor into your investments?
2021-04-18 20:11:38,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the write up. When you said 65% loss in March, was that yearly/monthly profits, overall portfolio drop%, % of initial capital?"
2021-04-18 20:11:42,wallstreetbets,"This seems like it will work. For one to choose this strategy, they really must understand themselves. It is going to be incredibly difficult to not panic when down 80%. Or even lesser amounts of 20-50%. 

I‚Äôm curious how it would do between successive large downturns in the market. Strategies really pick up steam when they are able to quickly build a lead in the beginning. For longer term returns, even after larger drawdowns, the lead in annualized return is maintained. But if you got caught in a couple of bear markets within a two year time period, how are you going to do? My guess is you still come out ahead. Again though, it may take an incredible amount of mental fortitude to not abandon this strategy. 

For me, I‚Äôll probably just stick to Roku and CRWD shares and see how it treats me for the next ten years. But I may open an account and follow this strategy, maybe. Good luck üëçüèΩüçÄ"
2021-04-18 21:13:14,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the quality post. I've been thinking of implementing something like this since reading a few weeks ago about [lifecycle investing](https://blog.jessriedel.com/2020/04/11/review-of-lifecycle-investing/), hedgefundie, market_timer, and also learning that cheap margin is available with IBKR. I agree with you that this is less risky than typical WSB

One question:
Do you have a particular reason for picking rebalancing bands of 1.8x and 2.2x, or just because they feel like a good balance? I wonder how sensitive the strategy performance is to the rebalancing rule, like switching to daily rebalancing (leveraged ETF style) or widening the band to like 1.4/2.6. I haven't seen anything on this topic, and it doesn't seem that easy to backtest."
2021-04-18 22:50:35,wallstreetbets,very nice!
2021-04-18 22:53:11,wallstreetbets,"Fellow factor enthusiast here.

Multifactor funds are pretty trash. Head over to portfolio visualizer and use the factor regression tool if you don't believe me - the only real factor loading you're getting is to Œ≤, but you're paying 10x the fees you should be paying for Œ≤. Also, remember that the value companies you own in excess of market cap weights [are already leveraged!](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=112553) I would also be *very* careful with MOM + leverage for obvious reasons. It's a trade where people can head for the exits very quickly.

IMO, the best factors you want to leverage are low beta and quality, but especially low beta. A leveraged, defensively tilted portfolio is basically the secret sauce of the likes of Buffet for stocks and Gross for bonds. (see [this](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Alternative-Thinking/Superstar-Investors) and [this](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/Buffetts-Alpha))  Value and momentum are where you want to be if you can handle a 3% tracking error and a bit of a bumpy ride on an unlevered portfolio IMO."

Or is the point that short box spreads lever up your margin and PM just has favorable margin requirements? If don't have 100k for PM in a non tax-advantaged account, it isn't work doing box spreads or still worth doing on XSP with a smaller account for example?

I'm interested from a lifecycle investing standpoint without having to resort to LETFs."
2021-04-18 22:58:27,wallstreetbets,"~~I think you made a typo, the Kelly formula is just the Sharpe, not Sharpe/vol (at least according to what you linked to).~~ So since your ""optimal leverage"" depends on the Sharpe ratio of your strategy, then depending on the portfolio, one would first have to backtest it in order to estimate the annualized average return & vol and then deduce the optimal leverage using the Kelly criterion. So it's not necessarily 2:1?

Good work though, refreshing to see good posts now come out!"
2021-04-18 23:18:49,wallstreetbets,"Could the brokerage increase the interest rate from say 0.5% to 4-5% while you are holding a position potentially? This could prove extra troublesome if we have a relatively flat market and if we see rates rising. I imagine that would be the achilles  heel of this strategy. Albeit I think most of us would expect the odds of that scenario to be very small.

The way I see leverage is that I already have a significant fixed rate mortgage debt that allowed me to place my capital into the market as opposed to needing to place it in my home. Thus, leveraging my portfolio in addition would increase my overall leverage too much. But, let's say I was happily renting and had no intention of owning, I could see adding modest leverage to a portfolio prudent."
2021-04-19 00:03:55,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for this, this sort-of validates what I've been discovering for myself using some really na√Øve simulations. It actually pays really nicely to just keep rebalancing your portfolio to align with your convictions (If I think that this stock should be 25% of my portfolio I will buy some to bring it's current value of 20% back up to 25%), since it takes advantage of a sort-of pumping effect (I don't know the terminology). With some scripting knowledge I was able to create a little program that reads a website for me and tells me what trades I have to make to rebalance, so maybe not the craziest returns, but I'm happy. Hopefully I can be less distracted so I can focus on my job and actually make some money to put into this scheme."

2021-04-19 02:20:48,wallstreetbets,"I am also using leverage. However I'm using about 1.05-1.10 leverage. Going 2.00 seems insane and ultra risky even with a diversified portfolio. I'd probably go up to 1.2-1.4 leverage if the market suddenly drops, but you never know when that will happen.

Just wondering what is your contingency or plans if say the market drops 20-30%? Are you sure your portfolio can withstand such a drop? That might be enough to wipe you out if you're going on 2x leverage. Remember that it's called ""margin call"" but IBKR (I use them as well) isn't your friend and they don't ***HAVE*** to give you that call. They can insta-liquidate your positions if they or their algo (subject to change btw) feel it necessary. Just remember that the first thing they show you when you login isn't your ""Net Liquidation Value"". That's what us clients are to them at the end of the day."

2021-04-18 20:52:52,wallstreetbets,"Maybe it's a matter of perspective. You have to go 50% ITM before an option has less than 2:1 leverage, so most people here using options already employ far far more than 2:1 leverage. Plus, this portfolio is extremely well-diversified, unlike options on individual stocks. So I think the above is probably conservative as heck compared to what I see most do here. But I expect a higher average return. So just showing, what I think, is a better way for most."
2021-04-18 20:21:53,wallstreetbets,USA does have a greater capitalization weight so it makes sense to have more in that IMO. And whatever sector rotation I do comes purely from the choices of the smart-beta index methodology. Glad you liked the DD!

2021-04-18 20:27:12,wallstreetbets,"As long as the equity premium is decently positive during your investment period, this should have pretty good returns.

2021-04-18 20:18:15,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for writing out my thoughts a bit better than I can. 2x leveraged so if you did this starting after March 2020 drop you would be doing great. but with the last few big crashes showing ~50% SPY loss you would get fucked even with 1.8 leverage and proper rebalencing. 

Tldr, don't time the top (looking at you WSB)"
2021-04-18 21:24:43,wallstreetbets,"It was arbitrary. I wanted a set of bands that were triggered often to actually compound, but not so often it gets triggered for small whipsaws. Since 1.8/2.2 gets triggered after a market move of about 10%, that seemed good enough to me. You could likely go a bit tighter but I wouldn't go any looser, 1.4/2.6 is huge, you're basically market-timing at that point. A 1.4x leveraged portfolio is very different than 2x leveraged.  
I haven't backtested different bands though it wouldn't be that hard. That said, whatever you find in the past is unlikely to be the best going forward so I just prefer to pick something reasonable and intuitive and forget about it."

I'm quite happy with them."
2021-04-18 21:26:35,wallstreetbets,"In the FAQs, I mention what to do with smaller accounts, but I hope you do eventually hit that $100K milestone since PM is very useful!"
2021-04-18 23:34:30,wallstreetbets,Why do you say it would lose value over time historically? I'm not seeing it...
2021-04-18 22:46:35,wallstreetbets,"""So portfolio margin gives you the advantage where these legs don't actually dip into margin because of the way it treats the rest of your holdings?""  
Exactly.

""If don't have 100k for PM in a non tax-advantaged account, it isn't work doing box spreads or still worth doing on XSP with a smaller account for example? ""

If you don't have PM, selling boxes of any kind, or any index, is useless because your MM goes up by as much as the box is valued. In other words, the box must be fully collaterized with Reg-T margin. PM, OTOH, understands it is a risk-free position in terms of underlying movement and does not increase MM at all."
2021-04-18 23:03:47,wallstreetbets,"I don't think I made a typo. The link I posted says Kelly Criterion is (Expected return - Risk free rate)/ Volatility\^2.  
Since Sharpe = (Expected return - Risk free rate)/ Volatility, then just substitute into the Kelly formula, and you get Kelly Criterion = Sharpe/Vol.  


And yes, you'll want to somehow estimate the Sharpe and volatility of your portfolio to figure out your Kelly Criterion. I estimate that's about 2:1 leverage for stocks based on a Sharpe of 0.4 and vol of 20%. Stocks likely will have a slightly higher Sharpe and slightly lower vol (so the Kelly bet is likely more than 2:1), but I like a little margin of error built-in."
2021-04-18 23:25:47,wallstreetbets,"The brokerage wouldn't randomly do that. Even if they did, I borrow directly from the market, not the brokerage. However, if interest rates rose, yes, borrowing costs for options and margin would go up commensurately. If that happened, it's not a showstopper. In theory, stocks should be priced to have a risk premium at all times, so if borrowing costs are 5%, stocks should have a forward-looking return of \~10% to compensate equity investors (otherwise, no one would want stocks, and they'd drop in price until that was the case). As long as there's an equity risk premium, the actual borrowing cost doesn't matter; it's all about the return you can get over that borrowing cost with your equities.  


And even if rates went up to 5%, and I felt like stocks also had a similar return, then I would just sell my positions, delever, pay back the loan, and realize taxes. Obviously not ideal on such a large gain but it is what it is."
2021-04-19 09:05:42,wallstreetbets,"The portfolio can withstand a 30% drop in a day without a margin call, yes. The market can‚Äôt drop more than 20% in a day due to circuit breakers though.

At the beginning of the easy credit and liquidity, I thought EMs would be a good play too. However in the last few months, it seems like that's not the case because EMs have the inherent problem of slow vaccine distribution.

2021-04-18 20:29:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes, in the short term, especially during Bear markets, you can lose a lot of money. But the hope is that as long as stocks have a positive return over the time you use this portfolio (and over 10-20 years, they very likely will), this should come out ahead. Plus, smart-beta exposure adds additional diversification and returns (very helpful in the 2000 Dot Com bust for instance)."

2021-04-18 23:09:28,wallstreetbets,"It might be more useful if you explained how VFMF is lackluster. I happen to think it is the best MF fund in the USA, surprised a factor enthusiast would think it's bad.

As for VBR, sure it doesn't load as much as other offerings. But you shouldn't think of your portfolio in chunks of funds (""the best SCV fund, with the best MOM fund, etc""). You should think of the **overall** factor loads. VBR doesn't load as much as VIOV, but it loads more than VIOV per unit of expense and turnover cost, so I just hold more VBR than I would hold VIOV otherwise, and achieve my target loads, with a slightly lower ER."

2021-04-19 12:46:57,wallstreetbets,"Because you should rebalance, the losses are exponential but exponentially **decaying.** This would have survived the Great Depression and GFC and came out ahead so yeah it can handle a ""protracted downturn over the span of 3-18 months"". I address why this loses less than half during downturns even when using 2:1 leverage in the FAQ:

\- Doesn't this lose money during Bear markets? If you use 2:1 leverage, shouldn't it have been wiped out during the GFC (stocks dropped more than 50% then)?

It loses a ton of money during Bear markets (about 65% personally this past March, much more in historical backtests that include events like the Great Depression). I didn't say it was riskless, only that it had the highest compound return long-term than any other strategy that invests more or less in stocks. The reason it doesn't get fully wiped out is precisely because you sell positions every time your leverage rises past 2.2x, to get leverage back in line. This is crucial. Otherwise, a simple market drop of 50% over any amount of time will fully liquidate you (compound return of -100%, the exact opposite of what we're aiming for)."
2021-04-19 12:32:57,wallstreetbets,"Right. We don't have factor data, or International stock data (let alone international factor data) that goes that far back so I've just used USA stocks as the proxy for the Kelly Criterion, but then apply it to a global, smart-beta portfolio."
2021-04-18 23:25:16,wallstreetbets,"VFMF scares me because it may not be rebalanced enough (DFA rebalances daily to maintain consistent loadings) and because in general (perhaps due to recency bias haha) I'm much more fond of targeting small value than large value, which you own a lot of with VFMF (especially seeing as how both the risk and behavioral explanations for value make a lot more sense for small than large) + because I'd much rather have the value names *and* the momentum names √† la Wesley Gray, not the value + momentum names (you don't benefit as much from the styles' negative correlation with each other and you restrict your investable universe more than I'd like) + because (maybe irritationaly) a crap ton of negative alpha (3% per year!) gives me alphaarchitect PTSD...

I'm also pretty wary of SCV that doesn't screen for quality/profitability. VBR has a lot more junk in it than VIOV or IJS (committee-based index selection removes it inadvertently) or AVUV."
2021-04-19 12:38:49,wallstreetbets,Cool. I know this is WSB but what do you think about the academic position that you should do this with a higher sharpe (lower vol) risk parity portfolio with other asset classes incl.?
2021-04-18 23:41:22,wallstreetbets,"VFMF rebalances almost daily, that's why it has such a high turnover (>100%). There's a Vanguard paper from Antonio that specifically explains why they rebalance so frequently and it's because they want the highest factor exposure out there. DFA, I thought, rebalanced much less frequently, look at DFFVX, it's got a turnover of 20%. Where'd you hear DFA rebalances daily? Everything else (except maybe Avantis) reconstitutes even less frequently. I'd say VFMF is one of the best ones out there in terms of maintaining strong factor loadings.  
If you don't like LCV and MCV, fine. I personally like getting factor exposure at all market sizes (so VFMF fits the bill) but I understand if you don't. But I wouldn't call that ""lackluster"", it's not a bad thing.  


Also, holding the value+momentum firms together like VFMF, or DFA does (with their momentum screen) is superior to picking value and momentum firms separately and owning both for many reasons (the diversification from correlation is more effective, you get stronger loadings, lower transactional costs, etc):

Only time I've seen any one argue otherwise was AlphaArchitects, but I'm pretty sure they're wrong. And they've come out and argued against it any ways. You can see in this article, they show a combinational approach (like VFMF does) provides far higher returns:  
[https://alphaarchitect.com/2018/01/19/value-momentum-factor-portfolios/](https://alphaarchitect.com/2018/01/19/value-momentum-factor-portfolios/)  
As for the negative alpha, that's just from a short regression, I don't worry about it. I think it's better to look at the actual methodology and costs, instead of whatever alpha it has realized in two years.  


As for VBR, yeah, a quality screen is nicer but I'm sitting on a ton of gains, not gonna switch now."

>Probably, but not by much. The main issue is that assets like commodities and bonds are so tax inefficient and I don't estimate high-enough returns for them to warrant them. That said, if you're optimistic-enough about them, add them, recalculate your Kelly Criterion, and leverage accordingly. Ditto for any other strategy like dma200; if I felt confident about them, I would add them so if you do, then add them, that's totally fine!"

Perhaps my fear of the positive skewness of the returns of the individual stocks that make up factors has clouded my judgment, but that's what reading too much Bessembinder does to you! DFA definitely rebalances daily. They brag about it all the time on their website and use it as an example of why an active factor approach > index. I'm surprised they don't integrate factors though, a momentum screen is not a momentum tilt, and DFA doesn't really integrate RMW and value IIRC..."
2021-04-19 12:46:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that makes sense. I'm seeing some crazy big kelly fs for risk parity portfolios (0.76 / 0.09 = ~8x for example). No way I'm going for that much leverage, so I might as well stay equities like you and go for 2x. Any link for dma200 as an investable strategy?"

Regardless, I see a ton of potential on VFMF, I think the methodology is a factor bull's dream come true. We'll see what happens!"
2021-04-19 12:51:35,wallstreetbets,"That kind of Sharpe and vol might have been achieved by Risk Parity in the past, given the amazing bond bull market and exceptional commodities returns. Nowadays, commodities are financialized and display hefty contango, which is why they've shown abysmal returns for decades now. And bond rates are not assured to drop like they did for the past 40 years, so clearly you shouldn't use the last 40 years of bond return. Whenever I calculate the efficient frontier using commodity risk premiums that are half of the historical norms, and bond risk premiums **adjusted for rate changes** since the 80s, I generally get a Sharpe under 0.5, and portfolios mostly made up of stocks. So I do find commodities and bonds are in the efficient frontier (though the Risk Parity portfolio definitely is NOT), their weights are typically inconsequential. When I factor in tax costs, they're just not worth it IMO.  
Don't know much about dma200, sorry!"

2021-04-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV DD - No Bullshit CLOV has a very interesting setup right now but way too many people seem to only care about the short float debate that has been unfolding over the last few days. To sum that up: FactSet (top financial data provider) had the CLOV float listed as 23.5M and short interest at 39M - putting the percentage of the float shorted at 146.6%. This circulated online and has been argued on twitter and reddit starting Friday. Factset has since updated the float to 109.8M making the 39M short interest account for 36% of the float. They previously had deducted the CEO‚Äôs class B shares from the total class A shares, and although his shares are ‚Äúnon-tradeable‚Äù and shouldn't be included in the public float, they were only using the class A shares to determine the float as all class B shares are already non-tradeable unless converted - so shouldn‚Äôt have been part of the equation to begin with. Now I could get more into the ""Hindenberg said this‚Äù and ‚ÄúS3 said this‚Äù bullshit that people have been arguing about...

But heres why NONE OF THAT EVEN FUCKING MATTERS

Shorts and those who have been bashing CLOV and arguing against the original short float number are taking a victory lap, like Factset updating the short float to 36% destroys the entire bullish case for CLOV and now it will tank. BULLSHIT, here‚Äôs why:

The 39M short interest number being used in the short float calculation is from 3/31. Over two weeks ago. When the two highest volume and highest short volume days in CLOV history have occurred within the last two weeks. With \~30M short volume on 4/8 and \~90M short volume on Friday (according to Fintel). We don‚Äôt know at this time how much of the short volume is covered and would be included in the current short interest; but given all this, you could logically conclude the short float on CLOV right now could be pretty damn high. For context, 36% short float - based on outdated short interest from 3/31 - is in the ballpark of double what we're currently seeing in GME or AMC, and would still make CLOV one of the highest short float stocks in the entire market right now.

The short float is only a small piece of the puzzle, and it‚Äôs without a doubt high enough to trigger a short squeeze if price continues to rise, end of story. Now let‚Äôs get into the shit that really matters.

First off, from a technical perspective, there are some good signs. (if you hate technical analysis or think you're so good at it that you'll find a way to disagree with whatever I say then skip to the next section)

https://preview.redd.it/06weuky6tzt61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=64b8a0b9d28d85d079627746c4e1832aec8f153e

* MACD bullish
* RSI only starting to warm up
* Decent support built between $7-$7.30
* But what‚Äôs really screaming on this chart are these two recent MASSIVE buying volume days coming after about a month of consolidation with a double bottom pattern making higher lows.

**Now let‚Äôs get into call volume**

[Some of the order that came through Friday](https://preview.redd.it/ksveumt0tzt61.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=2577d77bf9ab0d6f3180c955e9af5b861f859f3b)

https://preview.redd.it/a7e1pes3tzt61.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=83c9ea5a0d92808cfd65626f792fa1078443b1ed

Fridays call flow and the sheer volume and open interest on some of these call options speak for themselves. This is where I should break down the mechanics of a gamma squeeze, but really all you need to know is that heavy call volume is important for two reasons: 1) it can be a good indicator of where money is flowing in the market and 2) the people who write the call options need to buy shares to hedge against their position. The more the price rises the more shares they need to buy, helping to push price higher just like we see in a short squeeze.

&#x200B;

Next, CLOV is down over 50% from Dec/Jan highs. Some of the main reasons for the drop would be:

* Money flowing out of growth stocks and SPACS
* Hindenberg short report
* Short seller price manipulation

The Hindenburg short attack really did a number on CLOV. The stock was trading at about $14 prior to the release of their short report and dropped over 50% in the weeks following its release.

Hindenburg attacked CLOV from many different angles. One of their main arguments being that Clover Health uses misleading and unethical marketing practices to boost sales, as evidence stating that in 2016: ‚ÄúClover was fined for misleading marketing practices by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)‚Äù

Well, just this month (April 8th), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services granted Clover heath approval in 10 new states. CLOV has yet to release a PR on this but it has been updated on the CMS website (see picture below). The stock price jumped with huge volume on this news but short sellers were able to manipulate it back down until the spike we just saw on Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/sc2w81eatzt61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eb791918794ff6a425e42fffa397e409788b782

It seems that Hindenbergs argument doesn‚Äôt hold up as the same federal agency (CMS) they were using to support claims against Clover Health is currently supporting Clovers expansion into 10 new states. Which is huge news for CLOV by the way.

&#x200B;

**Wrapping this up**

Now say what you will about Chamath, but he had retail investors back during the GME squeeze. He promoted it, posted his personal positions, and while Wall Street, CNBC, and others attacked Gamestop, Chamath defended retail traders and the movement as a whole. It may be a total coincidence that his SPAC‚Äôs were the target of short attacks shortly after, but his support of the GME squeeze may have made him a bigger target.

&#x200B;

No one knows what will happen in the market, I sure as hell don‚Äôt, but given all that's been laid out here, I like the stock.

$CLOV to $100

&#x200B;

EDIT: anyone who thinks this is part of a conspiracy to distract from GME, it's not. Holding GME, love the setup going into this week.

Also: this is not financial advice, do your own DD blah blah blah

And for those asking about my position. I'm looking to add shares and calls Monday and/or throughout the week based on the price action and within my own personal risk tolerance.

&#x200B;

**Update 4/20:** people asking if they should sell. You shouldn't be trading if you need someone to tell you.

Nothing has changed. The market dumped and people sold. If there's not enough buying pressure selling can take over. Doesn't mean buyers won't take back control.

Long term, my opinion is that anything under $15 is a buy. Dips are opportunities. Not worried.

I like the stock. Make your own decision."

But they still don't understand the depths of retardation we're capable of. What should be bad news for the stock can just as easily be a rallying call for us to defy those fuckers' expectations and reap huge rewards from their overconfidence. Imagine their faces when CLOV hits $25, then $50."

Jokes aside, i've been buying every dip on clov until i ran out of money and i am currently holding 1300 shares and a bit of option plays.
My initial pt was 30 for end of year... now upgrading that to 100 by next month:).


The time to thank Chamath and reap huge rewards is here!
Pain for the shorters and their illegal market making strategies!
Let's goooo!

PS: Gme conspiracy theorists should shut the f up, it's not like all the money in the world is locked in gme and this, contrary to gme, is actually a good fundamental play which, if you get holding the bag, like most gme holders who bought at 400, you can still hope for profits in the long term.
gme bag holders should stop trying to discredit any other stock discussed here, especially CLOV, with great fundamentals and 150% shorted."

My only ""complaint"" about your DD is just pointing out that the Call buying for May 21 expiration is pretty low numbers (dollar wise). There are some big players in WSB and a $20k buy of calls isn't that big of a deal for a lot of people. $120k is pretty large...but that could literally just be Hindenburg or whoever TF shorted it."

2021-04-18 23:11:31,wallstreetbets,Ummmm short volume being 90m does NOT mean short interest goes up by 90m. Sorry volume is kind of a useless stat because it includes MMs opening short positions and covering within milliseconds in order to provide more market liquidity.

Its like do they not care about the company and people they are destroying?

Its the same thing but on a longer chart. Even if you borrow at a low fee, the shorts will want to cover at some point if they are taking substantial losses if buyers are in control raising the bid/ask.

2021-04-18 20:16:50,wallstreetbets,Would be super funny if chamath through a proxy or when himself buy up the rest of the float to screw Hindenburg.  They say no positions but went go through all the effort to do a report then correct factset's numbers.  Can't be doing it for the public good I don't think.  Think must have a pretty big short position in this.
2021-04-19 03:36:18,wallstreetbets,I think this is actual dumbass newbies chasing short squeezes. WSB is about YOLOing on something for no reason

2021-04-18 20:22:07,wallstreetbets,"Never said they were the same. But they are related. And when you understand the distinction you can infer how one number may relate to the other.

The distinction you‚Äôre point out actually supports the case that‚Äôs being laid out here."
2021-04-18 23:50:34,wallstreetbets,I'm sorry but I need help with this 1. So the short sell daily volume does reflect all the short positioned open and closed shorts the short interest does not?
2021-04-19 00:22:48,wallstreetbets,In all honesty wouldn't this be easier or simpler for the average Joe to understand the difference between the 2 if the just had to report short interest daily instead of only twice a month?
2021-04-18 23:27:16,wallstreetbets,"Right. But when the most recent short interest data you have is from the 31st it makes some sense to look at the more recent short volume among other factors when trying to think through how the current short interest may have changed. It‚Äôs just my personal opinion based on he data available that CLOV short interest could be even higher then it was on 3/31. And how this is all up for debate in the first place makes the whole short float controversy not that important in the first place.

And I think that‚Äôs pretty clear in my post"

2021-04-19 14:58:16,wallstreetbets,Not worried at these volume and options levels a gamma squeeze is in play.  I‚Äôm holding.
2021-04-19 16:34:58,wallstreetbets,Its gonna be higher than 35% after the last two days and the gamma squeeze is lining up with 61k calls @10
2021-04-18 20:45:52,wallstreetbets,"Shares outstanding is worthless to use as a metric other than to calculate market cap. This is because all the outstanding shares in the world won't matter if they can't be traded and over 75% of the outstanding shares are locked.

So, it has a float of ~100M, compared to GME ~60m. With high institutional ownership, CLOV could hardly be considered too thick to move or to lack volatility."
2021-04-19 16:36:11,wallstreetbets,35% of a 100 million float is still high
2021-04-19 06:53:11,wallstreetbets,Single digits to 500 in pre ain't a squeeze?
2021-04-18 23:35:27,wallstreetbets,You know people made money off of both of those stocks right? Just gotta buy in at the right time.

2021-04-19 00:51:57,wallstreetbets,Haha yeah 100 shares is 900 bucks.   Can‚Äôt see it going under 7 even if there isn‚Äôt a squeeze.  BofA analysts said 15 so unless they are really really bad then can you see it being below half their pt?  Max loss of 200 bucks on 100 shares in my opinion.

Honestly this is the only thing your post should say about SI, because it is pure speculation since YOU CANNOT INFER ANYTHING ABOUT SI CHANGE FROM LOOKING AT SHORT VOLUME. You just can't. There's absolutely no way to know what percentage of short volume was instantly covered. You say it could be even higher, but it also could be a lot lower and you cannot tell from short volume. It fucking sucks, we need more transparency on disclosure of HF short positions, but until that time comes we can't be misleading each other about it because we'll only hurt other small timers."

2021-04-18 22:41:07,wallstreetbets,You probably still think it has anywhere close to 140%+ short interest. It doesn't and the people originally claiming that have since fixed their error. It's really like 35% and there are still tens of millions of shares available for further shorting. You guys are about to lose your asses and I'm gonna be eating popcorn from the sidelines.

2021-04-19 01:04:33,wallstreetbets,"I don't know the actual number, my take is it's high enough to prompt 250mil volume on Friday. I would assume its higher than 50%. Theres FactSet controversy because Hindenburg Research pressured them to change the figure because of a technicality on Class A shares vs Class B shares. How I see it is that the shit ton of shares locked up in the float are non tradeable reducing the float by like 50% or so. These are ballpark numbers again, I dont care for accuracy in this situation because WSB is involved, this is a freight train. Imo you would be wasting time doing math and arguing instead of putting a trade on. You have to be in the game to feel the rush. Also, nobody fucking panic sell, this could be an exponential run. We wont be seeing penny's go up at a time, this could be dollars."

2021-04-19 00:15:03,wallstreetbets,"Oh it matters to me. I think it‚Äôs important and if that volume represents shorts increasing their positions with this much retail interest that is certainly worth considering when trading this week.

But even if that short volume represents all shorts closing their positions I‚Äôm still bullish but will trade it differently. If shorts are out I think it‚Äôs an undervalued play with good growth potential, nice chart setup, lots of interest from retail - not to mention there‚Äôd me much less incentive for shorts to try and bring it any lower.

And my post starts off with that info because the whole discussion about it clov prior to this has been a messy debate about short float. 

I just give the numbers we know, and my opinion that the short float could be pretty damn high. That‚Äôs a valid conclusion to draw."
2021-04-18 23:02:24,wallstreetbets,"You are literally retarded.

I just said it had 108m shares of float, which makes it have approximately 35% short interest.

2021-04-18 20:45:06,wallstreetbets,"This is the literal quote copied from the link YOU sent:

""The short interest data is just a snapshot that reflects short positions held by brokerage firms at a specific moment in time on two discrete days each month. The Short Sale Volume Daily File reflects the aggregate volume of trades within certain parameters executed as short sales on individual trade dates. Therefore, while the two data sets are related in that short sale volume activity may ultimately result in a reportable short interest position, they are not the same.""

No one is saying they are the same. But when you understand the distinction you can logically infer how a a massive increase in short volume MIGHT have an impact on short interest.

And it makes total sense to make that inference when you don't have a current short interest number and are trying to understand what it might be."

Model 3 has a mechanical latch for the front, but the rear door has no mechanical release at all. The newer ones may, since the Model Y has one, but it's hidden under the rubber cover in the door pocket.

Look up the definition of autopilot you idiot.

It has existed decades before Tesla even used the word autopilot.

All I'm saying is I wouldn't be surprised if the truth is being stretched here. Like maybe someone sabotaged the car. They then took control of it like an RC and crashed it on purpose just to take a shit on Teslas. There's physical evidence of the crash. The crash DID happen, but maybe there's more to it than what's given.

I'm not just gonna take it at face value."

2021-04-19 16:39:21,wallstreetbets,"Yeah was complete sarcasm. Hoping people didn't take that literally. That is an insane length to go in order to have the car drive without having to be in the front seat. As far as I'm concerned, Tesla does all that it can to prevent this and if you managed to ""outplay"" the systems at this point, you're doing it on your own accord and is no fault of Tesla. It would be insane to claim the driver wasn't at fault for overriding the systems like this."

2021-04-19 10:25:38,wallstreetbets,"Rookie....you don‚Äôt need to move the steering wheel.

2021-04-19 04:45:24,wallstreetbets,"Was the question whether or not it drives for you, requiring no human input at all?  Or was it whether or not it greatly reduces accidents?  It needs human input occasionally to function, but despite the fact that it operates with *less* human input than a standard vehicle it still achieves fewer accidents per miles driven.  It doesn't matter if the autopilot was only operational in locations that don't see as many accidents, what matters is that it's a reduction in accidents by quite a large margin.

Next are you going to tell me that since Teslas are mostly purchased and used in wealthier areas that they're less likely to be in accidents due to wealthier people being more responsible drivers?  And that this makes the achievement of 4x or more fewer accidents misleading and false?"

2021-04-19 04:06:11,wallstreetbets,"WHY did ARK buy COIN at that price? - Do they have a ""tech age-group blind spot""? (after all?)  
Or was it PURE PR, cash paid out to put themselves back in the news and show how cool they are?  
Perhaps it's also a DELIBERATE self-justifying prophecy, just a booster? If they buy at that price; a million impressionable folk will also buy, and so keep that price high.

ARK must KNOW privately in cold logic that COIN has a value of around 70 dollars...   
so what's that about, really?"

Another difference between this and rkt is the highest strike is only 30. If we all get 30c this thing will squeeze to 40+ like rocket did. I'm really tempted to roll at least 50% of my profits to 30c today just to see if it happens."

Really though, if you believe there was a reason for the stock price increase since Jan; ask yourself do you really believe the shorts covered **all** of their positions?? 

For a stock that they expected to go to $0. And now has been sitting $160.

Do you really believe they are not still shorting ETF's that contain GME? 

Do you really think Genslor is cool with them naked shorting?

I could go on and on, but do your own DD. But whatever you do, don't sit here and talk shit about it and ask us to change the subject. Do your own research and share why you think it's time to move on."

I don't think RBC is in trouble, but I'm pretty sure someone who had shares of them and most major Canadian stocks was liquidated (or at the least someone wanted to get the fuck out of a ton of positions real quick), and I wonder if it's another Archegos style sell off (but being kept under wraps better so far - our northern friends are so much more polite than the lads at Goldman and Morgan Stanley.)

2021-04-19 01:27:34,wallstreetbets,"I guess that all depends on your states requirements. For unemployment in my state you had to turn in a weekly log of what jobs you interviewed for and phone numbers for those companies and had to interview for like a minimum of 3 jobs a week or something. For food stamps had to prove income or loss of and I think bank interest counts (can‚Äôt remember for sure). Assistance for light gas and water was a one time payment that took over a month to get approved. Same kinda shit for Medicare. It was practically a full time job trying to receive and keep benefits. I don‚Äôt know how very poor people do it in addition to everything else they struggle with. Also you‚Äôre in big trouble if you get caught lying about income, which I‚Äôm sure includes what your describing. The state wouldn‚Äôt take kindly to that.

Edit to add: to qualify for benefits because of job loss instead of low income, you had to provide your letter of termination and you would not qualify for quitting your job. You also could not qualify if you were fired for doing something bad like sexual harassment or shitting on your boss‚Äôs desk or something"
2021-04-19 01:32:39,wallstreetbets,"And turning in your tax returns to apply for all those benefits will show your income and likely you won‚Äôt be approved. By the way, food stamps were awesome. We ate better without a job than we did with one. Lobster and steak every night!"

I can't in good conscience recommend buying more - not until *at least* sub-100, I'd wait for lower, but if you're willing to sell covered calls against the shares you're holding then you can at least use them to generate some income in the meantime. And if you're absolutely dead set on making mistakes like buying more, premium from calls can always be put toward more shares. For example, you can buy a whole extra share with the premium from the 300c for this week, and that's nearly double the current price. It's not going to 300 this week. And if it does, great! You'll have made a whole lot more money than you would have holding like some dumbass r/investing plebe."

2021-04-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why meta analyses of financial forecasts are not binary: Bayesian Statistics  Took a lot of adderall and read the jim cramer post as soon as it started to hit. Just wasted a few hours of my day writing this. I have shit to do

**Why meta analyses of financial forecasts are not binary:**

A famous argument for why Financial Analysts/Traders/Stock pushers are frauds or don‚Äôt know what they are doing is that they are barely correct out perform a coin flip in terms of the ratio of correct predictions on total predictions. While I do (most of the time) stand in the same camp of believing most analysts/stock pushers are frauds/don‚Äôt know what they are doing(at least the ones who have public followings), I don‚Äôt think this is a fair calculus or argument. I will explain why. 

**Binariness:**

First off we need to define what I mean when I say Binariness. In this scenario, meta analyses will determine a prediction by being Right or Wrong by some determining metric. This metric most of the time will have some sort of dependency on time and a uniform timeframe for all the predictions(*i.e given a prediction date t1, did the the prediction come true by t2‚ûùt1+3months?*). Being fair, they will take this statistical flaw into account and take and compare different t2 values( *t2‚ûùt1+3weeks,  t2‚ûùt1+6months,  t2‚ûùt1+next quarter, etc)* but I want to exclaim that the issue is that the predictions are NOT analyzed independently, when they should/need to be. 

**Why were they wrong?:**

So first off I want to clarify that predictionsCorrect/predictionsTotal is the correct calculus, but the way we quantify each variable is wrong. This section will clarify the steps need to quantify WRONG predictions CORRECTLY. Let‚Äôs assume an analyst deemed a prediction wrong, lets analyze their decision. 

**Direct contradiction of the prediction:**

Let‚Äôs say(lots of assumptions but it is important to get the point across) that we have a    

prediction that says ‚ÄúStock x will go from $15 to  $30 by next year because of good 

earnings. ‚Äù and by t2 stock x is $21. The stock price obviously did not meet the price prediction but why not? Did x have good earnings? Did they have bad earnings? In both of these specific scenarios, the predictor SHOULD be wrong. They might have been right about having good earnings but they were not right with the price prediction(so only ¬Ω legs were met). If they had bad earnings then this was a direct contradiction of the prediction(0/2 legs were met). 

**Missing leg of thesis:**

Elaborating on the above example‚Äôs outcome where ¬Ω legs were met, it is important to   
 ask why this leg was missing? Did the predictor take this leg into account and disregard   
 it? Did they just not think of it? Either way, it is important for any predictor to think of all 

variables, outcomes, and sensitivities that their thesis can be impacted by. In either of 

these cases, the predictor deserves to be wrong. 

**Black Swan Event:**

But what happens if an event happens that NOBODY could have predicted given the 

available data? Now defining something to be a black swan event can be pretty subjective 

at times. For example, a TSLA bear might not define the event when Elon Musk broke the Cyber Trucks window causing the stock price to fall as a Black Swan Event because they probably hold the thesis that their cars are shit and that their prices targets priced this in. A TSLA bull would probably defend themselves by saying that this WAS a black swan event. I‚Äôm not going to go into detail on whether these arguments are valid or not but I want to bring light to the option of throwing the data out since it is inconclusive. 

**Thesis has not been satisfied:**

Now lets say an analyst is doing a meta analysis on another analysts predictions and like I said before, they take all their predictions and compare them for some constant t2 without respect to the predictions actual thesis. What happens if the the prediction has an underlying assumption that is either WAY before t2 or WAY after t2? Now the prediction will appear wrong(or right) but the underlying test is flawed, skewing the score. If the predictor says ‚ÄúStock x will go from $15 to $30 by t2‚Äù but the analyst is comparing this outcome to t3 where t3 != t2, now you have a bad metric. 

**Devils advocate: Why were they right?**

I don‚Äôt think I need to elaborate this side of the coin as they are  mirrors of the above but 

obviously we need to cover all bases and want to make that explicit. 

**Bayesian Statistics:**

This whole essay is swimming around the idea of Bayesian Statistics, or Bayes Theorem of conditional probability: 

P(A|B) =P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)

This says the probability of event A GIVEN that event B is true is equal to **(**the probability of event B GIVEN that event A is true**)\*(**the probability of event A happening**)** all divided by **(**the probability of event B happening**).** Now, I won‚Äôt continue with the maths but I want to get across that this is the framework that should be used when quantifying a correctness metric. A metric that scores an outcome with respect to its thesis happening. After basing each right or wrong on its underlying factor, you will receive a bayesian approached ratio of totalCorrect/totalPredictions. 

**Conclusion:**

Hopefully this made sense and hopefully you learned something. I‚Äôm not going to proof read this either because I need to go to the gym and finish my day. I got caught in writing this because I took a bunch of adderall and didn‚Äôt see where the time went. Fuck

**TL:DR**

Don‚Äôt trust all articles that say ‚Äú\[Your fav analyst\] is only right 50% of the time!‚Äù. Many people who try to discredit an analysts outcomes are not using the correct metric in order to determine correctness."

2021-04-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PSFE DD Paysafe is a new entrant to the fintech field. They went public via spac titled ' **Foley Trasimene Acquisition II Corp** '. And just like every other SPAC in the last 6 months, the stock price has run up then gotten crushed. I personally hate spacs, however if the underlying company is valuable once the merger is complete they can be a good investment.

 The Spac is sponsored by Bill Foley, a notable entertainment investor. He made a fortune investing in wineries, golf courses, sports franchises, and hotels. Their CEO is Phil Mchugh, who has a track record working at citibank and barclays. Overall the management team seems pretty impressive. (Especially considering citi handles all wire transfers on earth. The CEO has a lot of experience with credit and merchant payments. I did notice that his linkdin profile is written in the third person, which could be a red flag. 

Paysafe is fundamentally a transaction handler. They serve mostly medium and smaller merchants, and transfer money between merchants, currencies, and forms of credit. They have some larger customers, notably including fortnite, twitch, and spotify. The firm handled 92 billion $ of transactions in 2020. They focus much of their business on gaming, and gambling. Which are both attractive and growing markets. 

Taking a look at the companies SEC filings, the notable risk factors they list include risk due to brexit, risk of accidentally processing fraudulent claims, and heavy reliance on third parties for much of their processes (payment processing, banking, routing/connectivity, customer support, IT). This leaves me with the question what do they really do? My understanding is that the company provides value to customers by the middleman and acting as a connection between merchants, local banks, and larger financial institutions. They process payments and take a processing fee. 

Other notable risks would be the major competitors that the company faces in the fintech world. They are partnered with visa and mastercard, but will have to compete with COIN, SQ, SOFI and many others. 

Advantages? The firm has a solid hold in the European and international markets. It's in a quickly growing industry, and has good leadership. 

&#x200B;

Finances.

PSFE has a market cap of $9.7 Billion. Their trailing 12 months revenue is $1.4 billion, and their gross profit was $891 million or 62.5%, very nice. 

The market cap/gross profit ratio is 9.7bil/891mil=10.8. At this ratio the company is pretty attractively priced. (If you bought the entire company, you'd make 100% profit in 10.8 years assuming no change in valuation). For reference, this ratio on a few other firms.

PLTR-68

COST-6.3

AAPL-19.1

MCD- 17.1

INTC-6.03

SPOT-27

SQ-42.6

PYPL-31.6

VISA-28.8

Relatively speaking, the price/earnings on this company is a bit low. Especially compared to their most similar competitors PYPL and SQ. 

Taking a look at the balance sheet it isn't so sexy, they have a lot of liabilities and long term debt. Not the worst I've seen, they still have more assets. Their quick ratio is 1.35. Perhaps this explains the low P/E. 

&#x200B;

Overall, the company has stiff competition, but good leadership and valuable customers. They are also specializing in a very attractive market. The company is very undervalued in my opinion, and could potentially have a significant run up to reach a more reasonable multiplier. If it's multiplier were to be similar to its peers (SQ,PYPL), the company would 3x in valuation. 

I started off this DD hating this company because it was a SPAC, however after looking into it I think I may invest.

Edit: another notable risk I just at thought of for these guys is currency valuations, they do a lot of transferring between currencies as they have a very large international presence. Also fixed market cap # because google is a liar

They also ask why there is no news item on the event. Well, there is no news item about it, because nothing happened and tomorrow RY will just open trading around the price it closed Friday. 

Let's look at some professional graphs to debunk the conspiracy of the economic collapse tomorrow. There are probably already people in their doomsday bunkers because of it. 

As the graph shows underneath, there is no price of 35$ to be seen. It even went up in after hours. What else do you need more to see?

If that institution or person is trying to get out of that position quickly due to margin requirements or some other reason, they probably sold the shares at that low, while another institution knowing this could have pulled the majority of their bids in order to drive the stock down in aftermarkets, so when they buy back their shares in a few seconds they can make double the money. It‚Äôs all a game. Try to open your imagination to how people or institutions can screw you over because you can damn well believe they are trying to bankrupt you."

Historically it has been proven that use of brokerage and ability to execute options in AFTERHOURS will make the greatest difference in the world. When you exercise an option, the person buying is buying at ask and selling at bid. During afterhours the spread widens greatly. Exercising puts and calls will allow it to bounce off of the bid/ask wall similar to what you saw. Amazon showed the same thing a while ago(twice actually with the greatest swing being hundreds of points in ah). Whatever you do, please don‚Äôt promote negligent behavior that is more likely to lead to someone going long on ROPE instead of making an actual profit."

Every company looks out only for the bottom line. They don‚Äôt need ‚Äúdefending‚Äù because Reddit comments complaining won‚Äôt change anything. Your comments make it sound as though you mistakenly believe otherwise.

Market conditions determine price. Different conditions different pricing."
2021-04-19 15:35:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes but that's just nasdaq.

Take a look at the same page for NYSE.  They have a lot of order types, including market."
2021-04-18 20:52:52,wallstreetbets,"No I don't think it would cost more Stateside.

The Americans believe in Capitalism... not protecting five large banks regardless of a countries size. Besides ,Canada has 40 million people now and these CDN banks make good money OUTSIDE of Canada. That's more than enough scalability as you say.

They have politicians and the populace convinced that they need this protection and contrary to your argument the free market is not working.

Remember when the dollar was at par but books STILL cost CDN's more? The narrative by the publishers was the same argument you're using... scalability and size of market. The publishers said we're too small to compete! What happened? The people called their bluff and protested and the publishers relented and moved the prices downwards.

That's what we need to do. Their service is garbage, their fees are too high and no they're not some scared cow."
2021-04-19 19:31:59,wallstreetbets,"Market on open and close, thats not ""market"" during the rest of the trading days. Its only for opening auction."
2021-04-18 21:14:28,wallstreetbets,"First of all, we were talking about the scalability of costs specifically for their brokerage apps within Canada, not other business outside of Canada. The brokerages are a separate business within a business. That‚Äôs how modern companies work.

Secondly as you stated, and I stated previously to you even bringing it up, yes there is less competition in Canada. That IS what market conditions are. My point being that obviously American banks would charge out the ass if not more if there was less competition. Which is capitalism.

They don‚Äôt have anyone convinced of anything you silly goof. Canadian banking is just an incredibly strictly regulated industry. This makes it incredibly difficult for new competition to come in and be competitive at the outset but it is happening slowly thanks to fintech.

And yes regulation is somewhat of a double edged sword. It creates a system with limited competition but also protects us in many ways. Stephen Harper started deregulating it prior to 2008, and almost pulled our financial industry down with the US, but thankfully the vestiges of previous regulation (which he had been actively campaigning to have removed btw) saved us from a similar financial system collapse, and the deregulation train was stopped.

Your price of book analogy is a false equivalency, and wouldn‚Äôt make sense anyway since it‚Äôs not a book monopoly which was causing the higher cost of a book. Every commodity costs more in a country with smaller population and larger area. It‚Äôs a matter of logistics, even adjusting for inflation. And while there was a brief public outcry the cost of books was never adjusted. Even to today on an exchange adjusted basis the cost of goods is still higher, as the cost of business in higher.

So, once again, it‚Äôs not a matter of convincing anyone of anything, and I‚Äôm not defending anyone. Obviously they can afford to charge less in fees. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs good that they do. I‚Äôm just explaining to you why they won‚Äôt, and since they are, just as you claimed Americans are, capitalists, they won‚Äôt until they absolutely have to."

Yes, the short interest of GME **is \~20%** according to most objective and standard measures, deal with it. You can't change the metrics when you want to and then insist on another metric when a stock threatens your GME.

And no, despite your conspiracies about HFs ""*hiding the SI""* using ETFs, you're still wrong. If an ETF squeezes, that doesn't mean every single one of its components is going to squeeze. Heck you know what? It's even harder to squeeze an ETF than a stock. You nuts have a hard time dealing with facts (you get now why people are associating you with QAnon?), and I'm not even sure you know how ETFs work at all.

Now a question for you, are you really sure you know how ETFs work? Or are you blindly trusting others' poop disguised as ""DD""?

2021-04-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLF commodities supercycle possible 5x or more. Hello, I am a large owner of CLF  right now. 
It appears we are in a commodity supercycle replicating 2008 and 2010 cycles on this particular stock. 
Steel prices have been hitting record highs what seems to be almost every other week. Iron ore prices are also at record time highs, as well as other building materials. 

With these rapid price Increases it's extremely possible that we are currently in a supercycle. They show no immediate signs of slowing down.
I encourage you to look at June 13 2008 when the share price reached $101.58 a share. And then again in april 29 2011 when the share price reached $93.72 a share. It appears this time around supply cannot meet demand just like on these past 2 dates that were in commodities supercycles. 

Other Catalysts being China, Russia, and United states are all trying to improve their infrastructure spending which increases demand for steel. Don't miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime. Diamond hands? Why not steel hands?"

This is false. If the entire market is going up, the probability of picking a stock that will go up is higher than 50%. There isn't a 50% chance that a stock will go down, especially in a rising market like today. You actually need to compare the probability on that particular day."

He's like a super WSB with Pump and dumping to make others lose their money as a main goal lol even a dumb ape like me can see that if all your profit is coming from buying the stock and selling it the next day then you're just robbing the idiots who listened to him and didn't sell when it spiked. If his long term bets aren't great like you showed then there's no way to show that it wasn't literally his opinion on his show driving the prices up and not an actual analysis/DD of what the company management and future situations hold for the price. But I'm an ape with an opinion without a live show so don't listen to me lol It's just one way to look at it.

I don‚Äôt know what the number actually is, but stocks are not random and don‚Äôt behave the same as a coin flip. They can also remain unchanged for a day or more, which a coin flip cannot do. During extreme bull markets, as in the last year, the odds of a stock going up are probably way higher than 50%. During extreme bear markets the odds of a stock going down are probably way higher than 50%. There are way too many variables to simply assign an equal chance of going up or down."

2021-04-19 10:28:48,wallstreetbets,"This is awesome! One potential bug, though: you probably used the starting price from that day's open. If Cramer made his recommendation later in the day, the price at that time might have been higher. (Assuming certain parties knew a recommendation was coming...)

That would lower the actual return in your analysis. The only way around it is to use the closing price on that day as your starting point."
2021-04-19 10:35:07,wallstreetbets,"I mean, when you have hundreds of thousands of daily viewers, it's quite possible to move markets with a recommendation. I think anyone who had that kind of notoriety who made recommendations would see similar results. If you can encourage even half of those viewers to act on your predictions, it becomes somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy, at least until the market corrects itself.   


That's why the 1-day return is so high, it's immediate action by viewership, which is compounded by people watching technical signals all day, then over the week and month the markets normalize before continuing on their upward trajectory. Think similarly to the GME price. Set aside the squeeze for a moment, and look at what happened:  


Someone with a large following made  a recommendation, their fanbase acted on the recommendation, and there was a massive upward swell made even more extreme by the squeeze. The market corrected itself, and the prices fell well below the peak, but still not quite below pre-suggestion levels before continuing upward, spiking again on news from a prominent individual in the public eye, and falling within a few business days."

2021-04-19 17:42:24,wallstreetbets,ü§î you guys realize Kramer isn't picking anything... stocks don't just magically get mentioned on television without palms being greased. There is always a financial incentive.
2021-04-19 18:12:48,wallstreetbets,"To be clear, youre taking open price the day after he recommends on his show? If a stock had earnings and is up AH and he recommends it, how does that get accounted for?"

2021-04-18 22:55:03,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, the Cramer effect is in fact real. He has such an audience, whatever he says does sway the market even if it's minimal"

2021-04-19 03:51:38,wallstreetbets,"Not a bad idea actually. I am sure every ape in this group is familiar with Raven [https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-successful-chimpanzee-on-wall-street](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-successful-chimpanzee-on-wall-street), the world record holder for picking stocks by a chimp.

2021-04-19 07:48:24,wallstreetbets,This has actually been done before I think.
2021-04-19 12:43:33,wallstreetbets,"It has been done, several times. Chimps (or really, and randomizing agent), routinely beat brokers.

The trick is having enough money to actually execute enough random trades to essentially trade the market. This is what ETFs are for.

I would love to see an analysis comparing a single holding of SPY against the portfolios of WSB members. I'd be willing to bet (and I have with my actual retirement account) that the ETF is making way more money than the average here.

Of course, that is the point. This place is all about high risk moves that SOMETIMES make money. If you want to just reliably make money, then you are ""investing"". Do that in your 401K."

2021-04-19 02:53:57,wallstreetbets,"Cramer Effect

Any significantly large group of people who hear  ""information"" and then ACT on it are going to affect prices. It doesn't matter AT ALL what the source is or how ""accurate, DD, or informed or fake or lightweight"" it is ..  
\- this is why meme stocks work so well? (and so badly)  
This is why the Kardashians are famous.. er.. because they ARE..  
There doesn't have to be any **content**, in fact the more REAL content, the greater the % of receiving-end folk will exercise their judgement and NOT knee-jerk react..

I think Turdmaster is right - the Cramer effect is another element to SERIOUSLY consider, like WSB, WSJ, publications, ads, memes, panics, rumors, and daily/weekly ""expert explanations"".. but don't ***beleive*** any of it.. just HEAR it.  Judge and make use of the effect.

And while I'm on this subject (an example)  : WHY did ARK buy COIN at such a high price? - are they that dumb? .. Either they really DONT know (generational tech blind spot?), OR it was a deliberate PR move to put themselves in the columns again, a DEMO of their forward thinking,  AND to convince punters that COIN is really  worth that price. Because if they convince enough folk, it will stick high and their move WILL justify itself ... but, by all DD and cold logic,  COIN is worth 70 - and they must KNOW that."
2021-04-18 20:14:33,wallstreetbets,Not sure about now but it was more of a pump and pump than a pump and dump

If you have no capital gains, you can keep pushing the loss forward (minus 3k) until you do."
2021-04-18 21:06:10,wallstreetbets,"1. This all has nothing to do with my initial point. My point it how it‚Äôs taxed and you can‚Äôt use taxes as an excuse to not take a short gain. (Some people legitimately think that by taking a short term gain you somehow owe more in taxes than your profit)

2. You don‚Äôt have to beat the market to make money. You have to beat the market to outperform the market. If I average 1% a year I‚Äôm better off than I was before but I still won‚Äôt beat the market.

But i also think if you play it straight all the time, and bought at open the next day youd lose outside of a bull market."

2021-04-18 21:09:31,wallstreetbets,Yes. It is out of context because that‚Äôs not what I said. I never said you don‚Äôt pay more in taxes if you get paid more genius.

Doubling down, eh?

Also you:

If you're the smart one here, explain how ""I'll pay more in taxes! No. You wouldn't."" Does not mean exactly what you're saying? If you earn more money, you'll pay more in taxes, but here, you mock it and say that you wouldn't pay more in taxes.

Seriously lol how are you not understanding the meaning of your own words?"

HELL it could jump to $100 and they would still say its a worthless company with no future.

I hold a lot of BB stock.  I got it on sale last year.  I believe in this stock, its fundamentals, the company, what it;s transformed into and what it will be!

Goddammit I still use their phones!  Greatest business tool ever for a fat fingered canadian boy who bough their very FIRST phone.

Number one is that being a telecom company still comprises the main aspect of their business and the Korean government is looking likely to regulate prices. They‚Äôll get capped on their main revenue driver pretty hard if it happens. Second one is strange, and has to do with wealth, inheritance and taxes. It was argued that this and many leading Korean companies look like amazing paper deals because there stock price is artificially repressed by the companies themselves. Due to the way Korean inheritance laws tax extremely heavily on stock, they repress the price in order to reduce taxes. Unsure of the veracity of that statement, but I did find that when I researched these older Korean companies they did all look great on paper. Apparently warren buffet has said that he could fill his portfolio with Korean securities, based on the financials. Food for thought"

If you toss a coin 100 times, you can argue that it would hit heads 50 times.  But you have to recongize that it could hit tails 50 times in a row -- goals should be to survive the 50 tails."

2021-04-19 13:15:50,wallstreetbets,"Holding a massive position with negative carry.
By freeing capital from margin requirements you get to hold beyond the 6.6x size in a stock for example (TIMS limitation). Writing options net credit to offset the risk is the negative carry part (getting ‚Äúpaid‚Äù to run an oversized portfolio). Hence leverage.
On the gripping hand, it comes handy when dealing with price jumps and volatility changes as it helps manage the margin calls effectively."

Most people think of hedging as protecting their PnL, offsetting losses from their measly positions. It often happens it‚Äôs the same people who think volatility is risk, but that‚Äôs another fallacy. 
The real hedging I feel you need when you have conviction in your thesis is against uncontrolled margin calls. Getting liquidated/forced out of positions without recourse. Figure that one out and you can handle 100% IV aka trade assets like $TSLA or $PLTR without flinching."

2021-04-19 03:15:52,wallstreetbets,I'm not talking percentages per day. I'm talking about 2 days where a massive amount of shares were shorted and not covered. The price nor volume would suggest not even 25% of shorts have covered. This isn't little mm stuff stiff. We are talking days where 21 and 66 million shares were shorted alone. Mm shorting doesn't account for this no matter how you slice it
2021-04-19 09:03:06,wallstreetbets,"10x average volume on Friday (enough for all shorts to have covered), however no shares available to short on interactive brokers this morning. tempted to open a small position and see how it plays out."

Break up the amount you want to put in into like 4 or so equal amounts. So you can keep buying as it continues to fall. This helps me psychologically also because if my plan it to buy 3 more times I actually see it continuing to go down as a good thing. If it turns around instantly I am bummed because I only got in 25% of what i wanted to. So instead of panic selling or being all nervous that the dip continues, you will glad it keeps going down so you can keep averaging in and getting more shares for the same amount of money as you previous buy/buys.

I did this back in march with SPY and FTEC. My fist buys were 290. It kept dropping. So I ended up buying at 290, 270, 250, and 230. Each day I saw another huge drop i just kept buying more. Now I have a low cost basis and look where SPY is now."

You are correct.  But vehicles have some minimum safety features, such as seat belts and air bags.  A simple child guard seems like the least they could do for a $4,100 machine."

Every single one I've owned/used has had it. I can't think of a single reason why it shouldn't be included in the treadmill and I can't see why Peloton shouldn't be criticised if they decided to exclude it from the design.

Even if you ignore the child playing alone aspect. It's still entirely reasonable to expect something to go under the back of the treadmill by accident."

A swimming pool sure, but a treadmill or stationary bike I never saw it that way."
2021-04-19 10:08:43,wallstreetbets,"Of course, diet is a much more important part. One can still get fatter while exercising every day for an hour, but that's harder to do without exercising on a calorie deficit diet.

I do believe in both of course, but I don't think they have the same importance for fat loss. For other reasons though, of course it's better to exercise than diet."

Have you considered temporarily neutralizing your overall beta-delta with short futures (/ES or /MES) ?  I feel like this would be an efficient way to temporarily reduce overall exposure with a very liquid instrument, all at once, instead of having to amend several not-too-liquid positions.

2021-04-18 23:16:29,wallstreetbets,"Don't be shy, go back a little further. 

Look at 2015, 2014, 2013. Year over year, it's worse and worse. It's a failing industry and AMC is a failing business who hasn't adapted to modern times. What changes have they made to merit even an $8 evaluation?"
2021-04-19 02:32:29,wallstreetbets,Of course no one knows. This is my bet. This is a casino.

2021-04-18 23:18:55,wallstreetbets,"I think sure we are all moving that way, but the theater will have its place. Cheap dates especially. 

There is a reason why people go the bar to watch a ufc event, or to Buffalo Wild Wings to watch the game. Even though they have the home theater system it‚Äôs the atmosphere and the human connection.

2021-04-19 01:18:00,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree with the hyperinflation narrative.  I just think there are at least a few steps between here and there.  Most importantly, at least as it relates to interest rates/mortgage companies, I think we'll see 10 yr rates go to zero before we see hyperinflation.  

My thought process on this is that the economy opens, but businesses yawn.  No spending, no capital expenditures, etc, due to the uncertainty in the market.  

One of two things happen, either the fed steps in to push spending by reducing rates even further or banks reduce their rates in order to get people to borrow.

Your 3% mortgage becomes a 2.5% then a 2% mortgage.  Then 1.5%?

Not sure where rates will go, but I think they go to zero before hyperinflation becomes a thing, maybe two years down the road."

Both because he consistently just makes great plays and makes shit tons of money (more than you or I will *probably* earn over our lifetimes), and because his DD is consistently great and well informed.

2021-04-18 23:29:44,wallstreetbets,"Well I can't account for every dollar, but I would imagine a large portion of those losses would be continuously rolling out their FTD's via deep ITM call options. I also imagine the fees for actual short interest are quite high. In addition, stripping GME shares out of ETF's can't be cheap. I'm sure there's more that I've missed.

I always marvel at the inclusion that is really exclusion in disguise.  I have enjoyed some of my time on wsb but have been hit with more negativity than I thought possible for not being here long enough, not losing enough, talking about gme or other plays I like and shamed for not knowing enough about the rules, certain stock plays, etc etc.  Fun board.  The GME part of it has been, BY FAR, the most fun part of this board thankfully.  I would suggest 8 millions new members move on to less negative pastures.  Life is too short to be shamed by nameless, faceless, self proclaimed gurus at anything.  Having said that, I am sure there are some great people on the sub, just wish I would see more of them.

2021-04-18 22:45:16,wallstreetbets,"> exactly the moment GME is about to moon

I've been hearing this since January. 

Every week is apparently the week GME will moon. 

I do agree CLOV seems to just come outta nowhere with this apparently massive SI. I'll probably still get some shares just in case. Worst case it'll be a long term boring ass hold. It'll turn some profit as long as you get in around the price it is right now."
2021-04-18 22:56:30,wallstreetbets,What contracts should someone buy tomorrow? Curious for friend with $4k to YOLO on CLOV
2021-04-18 21:07:15,wallstreetbets,"ASO, SKT, GOEV on that list as well.

I'm not putting money into anything but GME until it pops or goes sub 100."
2021-04-18 23:01:41,wallstreetbets,I see this going to 20-30 tomorrow. As you can see I bought 10s. Up to you dude
2021-04-19 07:34:52,wallstreetbets,BS - CLOV is not available on eToro
2021-04-19 00:55:21,wallstreetbets,"SLV never made sense from a math perspective, and the more I looked into the vocal experts in the SLV realm they're all lunatics.

If the math in the OP is correct, this is a stock that has an actual chance to squeeze.  Just due to the math."
2021-04-18 20:13:26,wallstreetbets,CLOV is fud.  There's only one GME.
2021-04-18 23:11:28,wallstreetbets,"Thanks.  New to this.  If bought 4K worth of contracts(roughly 40) tomorrow, (10c 05/21), how does that work going forward?  I‚Äôve tried reading up on this stuff, but I seem to not be getting it. I feel like CLOV is going to pop tomorrow and I want to take as full advantage of it as I can.  Sorry for sounding like a FNG, I just would like to know what happens after I do that.  Or should I just buy shares still and go with that.  Seems calls would yield a much bigger profit, but wtf do I know. Thanks in advance."
2021-04-19 07:45:03,wallstreetbets,"I see this going to 20+ as well, hopefully you are right it happens in a day or two, totally possible with float rotation 10x public tradable float. But it took GME a month to squeeze from the high SI in December. If it keeps grinding \~$10 for a few days it gives me some time to move into a larger position on CLOV."
2021-04-18 20:14:05,wallstreetbets,So ur saying gme still hasn‚Äôt squeezed

2021-04-18 21:14:16,wallstreetbets,"I used to have a similar problem in 2005 when I was 10 years old. It's tricky and it's worthwhile talking to her about it from an understanding perspective. 

Think about what it means to be a child right? There isn't that much to look forward to except maybe sports, music, and games. Your daughter is showing a huge engagement in something that is unchecked and it could be converted to something more useful. By the time I was 12, I was hacking the game and got banned and lost all my cosmetic goods.

The game was called maplestory, which I posted an image of here. Interestingly enough, one of Roblox's most popular games is a Maplestory inspired game (they use the same music and art styles)

2021-04-19 02:04:29,wallstreetbets,"It absolutely is - talk to any parent of young kids, they are all buying ""Robux""

Plus the value of RBLX is in their developer ecosystem - they have basically created the ""paid mods"" arrangement Valve tried (and failed) to create years ago and the thing is already loaded to the gills with MTX.

Remember a company's stock price reflects the market's assessment of the net present value of **future** cash flows - this is the reason people are paying obscene prices for SPACs with no income or merger announced yet, for TSLA, for GME **after** it starts to look like the company is going to transform under RC (but not before).

People will pay a premium for growth right now and RBLX, with their fanbase of MTX-loving kids and budding developer community, is absolutely a growth prospect."

You think that all these people with some being extremely intelligent are all at the same time wrong? You think that DFV on Friday is going to exercise those calls and then quadruple down by on top of that buying another 50k shares? Maybe you shouldn't talk about this stuff without reading the DD's and if you think you're right, making a counter DD of your own, my guy."

2021-04-19 09:56:05,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I did my own DD. I concluded, for myself, that there isn't any indication of GME being overshorted at this time.

Good luck, live in the past without any imagination. Buffet himself said that the brand of a company itself has a big value that you shouldn‚Äôt ignore.

Ps you compare airbus and boeing at the current situation after losing a lot from their ATH. This alone isn‚Äôt a fair comparison. 
Current situation. Rycey = 10 billions, boeing = 121 billions, airbus = 81 billions. And the possibility that both companies could need engines from Rycey. Not to mention SPCE and the planned jets. 

The world: inflation. That means market values of each company will gain. There was a time where nobody could imagine that a company could reach 1000 billions. Look at apple, amazon and so on ..."

2021-04-19 08:04:54,wallstreetbets,"It seems you're wrong reading from [here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062215/what-difference-between-class-shares-and-other-common-shares-companys-stock.asp):

> About Preferred Stock

>Class B stock should not be confused with preferred stock.Ôªø Preferred shares are a different type of asset. In fact, they are a kind of hybrid between a stock and a bond. 

If they are class B stocks and not preferred stock they [are still technically in the float](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062315/what-difference-between-shares-outstanding-and-floating-stock.asp) as they are common stock:

>Shares outstanding and floating shares typically refer to all classes of a company's common stock, as opposed to preferred stock.

Maybe you were saying his position is in preferred stock?"
2021-04-19 10:47:55,wallstreetbets,"But since they're included in the float and then immediately taken out because they're restricted I never counted them to begin with....

From 10-k:  There were 145,345,832 shares of the registrant‚Äôs Class¬†A Common Stock and 260,969,355 shares of the registrant‚Äôs Class¬†B Common Stock issued and outstanding as of March¬†24, 2021.

Class B shares do not trade in the open market, most are restricted and you cannot borrow them so when you're thinking about SI (and why we care about short interest and why its important) they're irrelevant.

So there are 145mm Class A... \~35mm of those are Chamath and Osborne (through SCH and ChaChaCha entities) (for context CAREFULLY read footnote on page 102 of the 10-k) then the read borrowable tradeable relevant float is 109mm. So short interest (although could be higher now) as of 3/31 is around 40%

Read this post that we put together: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/mt1g4k/lets\_talk\_about\_float\_part\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/mt1g4k/lets_talk_about_float_part_2/)"

>Class B shares do not trade in the open market, most are restricted and you cannot borrow them so when you're thinking about SI (and why we care about short interest and why its important) they're irrelevant.

But that's the point I am making, they should be in the float as it is defined imo, although I can't find a source that is 100% clear about this, there is none that says that class B common shares are not in the float.

I'm not disputing the count, it checks out, I don't understand which is the definition of float used here though. It's even more unclear to me that Yahoo shows an outstanding of 145mil while it should be 405 including the class B which again, should be in it? Is investopedia wrong?"

2021-04-19 12:33:55,wallstreetbets,"you didn't even mention the fact they increased their subscriptions revenue from $28million to $40million during the pandemic. During the pandemic when they would make less because of less driving. I can only imagine this going massive due to their relationship with Chevron. You could see ChargePoint in the Chevron parking lots in the near future.  


page 7 and 8  
[https://s22.q4cdn.com/779683160/files/doc\_financials/2021/q4/ChargePoint-Earnings-Q4FY21.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/779683160/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/ChargePoint-Earnings-Q4FY21.pdf)  


The only real reason their balance sheet didn't look great was because of the one-time stock warrants they paid out to insiders.

They could easily smoke out earnings every quarter in the near future.  


$ 73million in losses from stock/warrants/convertible stock  
$120million operation loss (op expense)  
$197million net loss  
$274million net loss attributable to common stockholders  
$(18.08) loss per share  


now subtract the one-time losses on stock  
$73 - $60 - $16 = $149million (about 45%)  


now you have around $125million in losses $(\~8.24) per share, for a company who is investing heavily into growth and increasing revenue almost double in a year with the pandemic. And remember, they will continue to grow the subscription (reoccurring revenue) part of the company every year.

I would not have seen this type of money at my old company for years, even if I took a similar role.  For internal moves, many companies will only raise your salary up to a certain point.

2021-04-19 01:39:40,wallstreetbets,"Yea. I should've allowed my account to be a margin account. Ive only sold cash secured puts before, but if I can sell puts and only use margin if it's exercised... That would be some nice premium."
2021-04-19 01:48:55,wallstreetbets,Your talking about taking our margin money and using that money to sell a put?    Isn‚Äôt that still cash secured ?
2021-04-19 01:54:33,wallstreetbets,"Im not exactly sure. I *think* if I had a margin account, I could sell a put, and *if* it gets exercised, I would have to be put those shares on margin, but I don't *think* that I'd be charged the interest on the margin until the shares are put. I could be wrong. I honestly haven't used margin yet."
2021-04-19 01:58:58,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs my understanding your not charged till you get your shares assigned.  I was just curious about if it‚Äôs still a cash secured put if you use margin.   Would that be a naked put?   Since your borrowing the money ?
2021-04-19 02:00:41,wallstreetbets,I'm guess so. Not as exciting and fun as selling naked calls right?
2021-04-19 02:10:53,wallstreetbets,I honestly don‚Äôt even know what a naked call is.   Or selling one.   Not sure if I want too know either
2021-04-19 02:18:14,wallstreetbets,"So easy explanation is you see some juicy premiums for 800 calls on gamestop. Only problem is you don't have 100 shares or the money to buy 100 shares. So you decide to sell a naked call with the 800 strike and collect that premium. GME suddenly shoots to 1k, if your call gets exercised, you're suddenly on the hook for 100 shares and have to buy at current market value. So you're down at least 20k."
2021-04-19 02:27:03,wallstreetbets,How do you sell calls without having the shares.   Does RH even allow that?
