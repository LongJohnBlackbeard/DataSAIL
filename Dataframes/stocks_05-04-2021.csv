2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,the most disappointing stocks $AAPL $COIN $TAN were told to be the most promising stocks and have cost me so much. I‚Äôm down about 1k from all of them. Should i cut my losses and sell what i have left or try and hold for the long term?
2021-05-04 09:54:58,stocks,Are you 12?
2021-05-04 09:49:18,stocks,Aapl is only up 12% 6Months and 70s% 1 year. So disappointing man. Why does it not keep going up forever like it did in 2020? /s
2021-05-04 10:01:57,stocks,"> and have cost me so much   

 - COIN: +11% YoY    
 - AAPL: +77.75% YoY    
 - TAN: +167.46% YoY   

Those are all wildly successful companies. You're losing your shit over some sideways movement after ATH for three~ months."
2021-05-04 09:52:12,stocks,You have no business being in stocks if this is how you feel.
2021-05-04 09:46:18,stocks,It‚Äôs a down day today on a lot of stocks. You‚Äôre already down 1k what‚Äôs a little more? Wait for a better day if you have to take losses
2021-05-04 09:50:51,stocks,Apple is undoubtedly a long term hold. Not sure about coin but I would sell TAN. TAN along with QCLN+PBW will take 6 months to over a year to get back where they were before the slight correction.
2021-05-04 09:59:53,stocks,$AAPL = the most disappointing stock even tho it consistently outperforms the S&P. okay got it.
2021-05-04 09:53:11,stocks,Did you buy into apple at ath?
2021-05-04 09:56:04,stocks,It is not a loss until you sell.
2021-05-04 09:59:34,stocks,Mosts watchlists are a bloody mess this morning. Don‚Äôt be discouraged. We in this man. Welcome to the market.
2021-05-04 09:59:47,stocks,Same i'm already down $1k
2021-05-04 10:00:07,stocks,"It's not just them.......everything I've purchased in the last 3 months has steadily gone down.  It seems to drop like 5%, 3%, 2% slowly walks down hurts quite a bit then slow walks up for a bit to kind of make you think okay maybe we're going back and then drops even further.  Then does it all over again.  It's just been a slowly depleting hole in my portfolio in several sectors (oil/energy, reopening trades, tech and growth, cyclical, even defensive stocks).  The market as a whole is going up but I can't seem to find a single stock that is actually making gains it seems."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"DD: $ASO - Lawyers, Guns, and Money If you have not heard the song *Lawyers, Guns, and Money* by Warren Zevon then you're not missing much, but it does loosely tie into my analysis of **Academy Sports + Outdoors**.

**Intro:** There's a chance you haven't heard of Academy Sports if you're not from the Southern United States- and that's ok. The business is simple, Academy Sports operates as a sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer, similarly to Dick's Sporting Goods, Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's, and Sportsman's Warehouse. In terms of business model, there's not much more to it than that, except for 1 key difference compared to Dick's and some other competitors; **Academy Sports sells guns and ammunition**. I'll be using some comparisons to these company's in the analysis below. 

**Notes:**

1. The reason I'm putting this write-up together today is because of recent action on behalf of the major shareholders. I will go more into detail on that below.
2. ASO was intially publicly offered at the beginning of October 2020. I typically stay away from IPOs in general, but took a look at the company and decided to do a deeper dive. 

**Metrics:** 

1. **ROIC**, as of today, is 12.48%. This has improved year over year since 2019(the company was private before this so financial statements only go back so far) and doubled from 2020 to 2021. While Sportsman's Warehouse has had double digit ROIC over the last few years as well, it's more sporadic and up or down with some negative returns mixed in quarterly as well. Dick's is the steadier of the 2 comparisons maintaining that ~10% ROIC over the last few years(GuruFocus).
2. **D/E ratio** is currently at about .71. The good news, however, is that because ASO exists largely in the Southern United States, they did not bleed as much during the Lockdown Era. Depending upon the state, stores were kept open and selling while competitors had to close their doors and take on more leverage to survive. This is reflected further in ASO's financial statements showing that virtually all of their existing debt is long term. Their current cash position outweighs their short term debt substantially. (Side note, their cash position has been *at least doubling* every year for the last 3 years.)
3. **P/E & PEG** ratios are 8.91 and .21, respectively. The PEG ratio is based on Finviz's EPS Next 5 years expectations, but since I'm a fan of extrapolating out a shorter amount of time from the most recent data as possible, a safer PEG ratio to assume is 8.91/11.05(Next year's EPS growth expectations), which would be .80 instead. Again, this is the *low end* EPS growth expectations for ASO. Admittedly, the previous year was a great boon for outdoor and sporting goods retailers, so instead, if you'd like to take a larger sample size of the last 5 years EPS growth it would be 8.91/32.7, or .27 PEG ratio. For a quick comparison, Dick's expected EPS for next year is an 8% growth and with a P/E of 15.77, that yields a PEG ratio of 1.9. But I didn't need to calculate that to tell you that Dick's is largely done expanding and growing. 
4. **Cash flow from Operations** has skyrocketed over the last few years, but it's important to note an anomaly. A large change in payables occurred from 2020 to 2021 which significantly impacted ASO's change in working capital. If removing it from the equation, to help get a better understanding of their cash flow operations, they still nearly *tripled* cash flow from continuing operations. Net income from continuing operations over the last few years has grown at an incredible rate too. (Yahoo Finance). Gross profit in general has followed a similar escalation path.
5. **The outside influence** of the guns & ammunition industry, while not a strict mathematical metric, should also be considered. Academy Sports, described by one of my Texas-born friends, is ""an institution."" Currently there is an on-going ammo shortage that's affecting the industry that is expected to grow at a rate of at least 6% a year through the next 5 years(Mordor Intelligence). The sports gun market is growing and many competitors simply do not offer to fill that market niche. 

**So what's the catch?**
Well, I talked about the Guns... I talked about the Money... What about the Lawyers? Academy Sports is largely owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts or KKR & Co. Inc. for short. As of this morning, they own roughly 65% of Academy Sports, making them the majority decision makers for the company. I want to be clear, **this is both good and bad**. Such a large position of ownership controlling the decisions for ASO will almost always benefit KKR moreso than other shareholders. On the other hand, KKR invested in ASO in 2011 and have helped establish the company as a quickly growing and successful retailer. The two are intertwined in a way that is mutually beneficial to each other, but not as much for shareholders. **Fortunately, this will change over time**.

Academy Sports + Outdoors announced after market on May 3rd that KKR will be issuing an additional 14 million shares of stock. For context, that accounts for roughly 1/3 of the current share float so this will dilute the shares fairly significantly. The upside to this is two-fold: 

1.  Starting today, shares should start trading a discounted, enticing price.
2. ASO also agreed to buyback as much as $100 million shares worth of the offering, thus reducing the dilution and adding to shareholder wealth. 

**Subjective analysis:** I like ASO and I like its prospects. It has the growth potential that Dick's no longer has, their management team has helped been guided by KKR to profitability, and it fills a market niche that some other competitors do not fill. It's important to note that the unraveling of KKR's shares will continue to happen over time, which will simultaneously frustrate shareholders but also spread ownership to a more reasonable degree across the Institutional spectrum. Their new focus on ecommerce has helped strengthen their bottom line and it's already started to pay dividends *without* considerable store growth. In a recent report, management had stated that 2021 won't be a time of store openings due to the inability to properly scout locations(although it was stated that 2022 should see 8-10 new openings). This is the slow growth mentality that I'm all for. This will likely be a multi-year hold for me, but it could just be the next big thing in Outdoor Sports & Recreation."
2021-05-04 10:17:42,stocks,"It IPO‚Äôd like 7 months ago at $13/share and it‚Äôs currently trading over $30/sh

If the big argument is that they sell guns/ammo, why not just invest in guns/ammo manufacturers?

Personally, It seems like gun/ammo runs are just cyclical and the current one has been ‚Äúrunning‚Äù for a quite a while."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Question about P/E ratio Hey there! I‚Äôm new to the stock world and I was just learning about P/E ratio. I was having trouble understanding why it‚Äôs fair to compare P/E ratios across companies. 
I‚Äôm almost positive it is unfair to compare EPS across companies as different companies will have different numbers of shares, and while one company may have more earnings, they may have many more outstanding shares so it is unfair to compare the two with EPS.
Now when we calculate P/E ratio, we do stock price / EPS. My question is why is it now fair to use the EPS when we add the stock price in to the equation to compare the two companies.
Hope this makes sense!"

2021-05-04 09:36:10,stocks,Because now you‚Äôre looking at what the value of earnings is PER share vs what you‚Äôre paying for each share. So buying a $10 EPS company isn‚Äôt better than buying a $2 EPS company if the share price for the first company is $200 and the share price for the second company is $3 ... You‚Äôre getting $2 of earnings for $3 vs getting $10 of earnings for $200 - so by looking at EPS in the context of price per share it gives you a better understanding of what you‚Äôre getting for what you‚Äôre paying. It‚Äôs still not a standalone metric though and you should always do more research as to why a companies P/E is different than another - there‚Äôs a lot you can‚Äôt tell by just looking at ratios

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Why should we even bother investing in growth/tech at this moment in time? Let's assume the fed is right and we don't raise interest rates until ~2023, it's my understanding that raising rates is going to send growth/tech stocks down because money isn't as cheap as it used to be. Under that assumption, shouldn't that mean it would be smarter to sit these next few years out until they end up raising rates and then open long positions? I recently purchased 10 LEAPs on various growth/tech companies and plan to exercise them in the future. Would it have been smarter to just wait for the rate hikes later on or how much of that is already being priced in the market today? I plan to be these positions 5-10+ years so I'm just curious."
2021-05-04 09:43:03,stocks,"Buy low. If you can't buy something low, buy something else."
2021-05-04 09:33:14,stocks,"And why do you think once the growth/tech tumble after two years, they'll be lower than where they are today? I am not saying it can't happen. But what's your conviction behind it?"
2021-05-04 09:43:41,stocks,"Because tech is the future. Last year we experienced a huge leap in use of techonology and we aren‚Äôt going back to pre-pandemic times when it comes to tech. Don‚Äôt be bothered about the short term movement, since tech will overcome in the long run."

2021-05-04 10:12:58,stocks,"If the market correction that everyone is expecting happens tech stocks may go down, but unless we have another crash even with the corrections tech growth stocks will probably still beat the traditional value stocks.  If you are risk averse it would be wise to start rotating your investments to the traditional stocks and investments (Government securities etc).  The VIX is pretty low right so the corrections will likely lead to tech stocks becoming even more volatile.  Just note that in the long term you probably will lose out if you decide to adjust your portfolio like this."
2021-05-04 09:44:46,stocks,"I was convinced that S&P was way overvalued when it got $2,000 mark. You can never guess the top or bottom. I stopped trying. And I worked in finance amd have fancy degrees. Look at Buffet - he way misread last year.  And he is supposed to know things."
2021-05-04 10:07:45,stocks,brillant idea! sit out the next 2-3 years for growth/tech stocks and put your money into doggy stuff..much better I think!
2021-05-04 10:13:12,stocks,"Yes, if you think they have downside in the next 2-3 years, but upside long term, then LEAPs (assuming calls here) would be the opposite of what you'd want to hold. They would just expire and you'd get no benefit in the long term."

Just personally for me, those words have resonated and I‚Äôve looked for excellent companies and prioritized that over excellent prices. Of course if you can find both that‚Äôs great, but it‚Äôs hard for me to find an excellent company at an excellent price today lol"
2021-05-04 09:38:19,stocks,I don't have conviction on it that's why I was asking. Ig what I'm wondering is if the levels we are seeing today would seem undervalued even after the fed raises rates to normal levels?

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Can options contracts trigger a wash sale? Hello,I recently reading about the wash sale adjustment and was wondering if it also applies to the below options scenario:

Suppose I have 100 shares of XYZ and do the following:

1. I first sell a call option with September expiration against these shares.  I place the order in May, with the aim of selling them at $10. Let's assume the $10 strike price would generate a loss
2. Next, I buy 100 shares at $10 in May.
3. Then in September at expiration, I am forced to sell my initial 100 shares due to the price of XYZ going above $10.

Since I placed the option contract in May, would that trigger the30 day  wash sale rule?"

A reliable 3.5% dividend seems pretty good to have in an income portfolio.  there are more reason to own a stock than hoping for the price to rise."

2021-05-04 08:27:13,stocks,"Depends on the investor I suppose.  AGR seems pretty solid to me, I don't hold any but it looks at a glance to be a solid fairly risk-free income generator.  There is a segment of investors that thinks stocks like this are attractive is all I am saying.

Everybody bought the products they need and it will take 3-4 years to get profits like this again? \[cyclical product/overhyped buy/\] negative earnings past few years \[maybe due to acquisitions but still...\] 30% of stockholders equity\[370m of the 500m is in goodwill\] Increasing inventories when demand is going to drop off when covid ends. 4 of my friends bought webcams for our desktop we probably would've never bought webcams if not for covid.In 2020, 2019 and 2018, Amazon accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue, at 24.6%, 25.1% and 22.4%, respectively.reliance on amazon for profit margins.... Gamestop entering space... Amazon entering space... competitors are growing and taking small margins.

**There P/E is 30 during the greatest economic event ever for gaming \[covid\]. Seriously your overpaying.**

Short 10-20%... If a company is short more then 5% you should ask yourself the bear thesis."

2021-05-04 09:03:35,stocks,"CRSR's valuation really comes down to whether or not you believe that it can perform on the same level post-covid. Obviously the pandemic was really good for Corsair, but I'm not convinced those first quarter numbers reflect that too much. The U.S. are opening up, it's just that people like gaming, and will continue to do so.

The shorters clearly believe that Corsair's sales will drop when people go outside again. Personally, I think people will continue to buy gaming stuff even when they can go outside, just like they did before Covid."
2021-05-04 09:49:59,stocks,"P/E of 30? They've only reported 3 quarters of earnings since going public, just the last 3 quarters their EPS totals to $1.65, a P/E of 30 would imply a share price of $49.50, so you're clearly way off.

Even if they manage to only report .35 next quarter the ttm EPS would be $2, a P/E of only 20 would imply a price of $40/share.

Amazon isn't exactly known for making high-end products, I highly doubt they are getting into this space anytime soon anymore than they already have with their ""Amazon Basics"" brand.

"" demand is going to drop off when covid ends "" - This whole covid ending talk is so overblown, how long are we going to use this narrative? We're 14 months into this pandemic, if somebody wanted to get into gaming or needed peripherals to work from home they would have did it 6 to 14 months ago."

I don't know what their inventories consist of, but I'm inclined on the ""increase in inventories is good"" at this particular instance.

2021-05-04 09:12:53,stocks,This is definitely what I'm trying to get at thanks for the valuable input. The biggest concern is amazon... If gaming gets any bigger amazon will make higher end gaming gear/computers.... corsair relys on amazon for 30% of revenue that is not good!
2021-05-04 09:15:55,stocks,I don't know how high 15% DTC is \[I think currently its 10%\~ don't quote me i read there numbers last month\]... But remember if you believe revenue grows in CRSR amazon get more enticed to build better pc gaming parts or buy a company like turtle beach out. You are playing a double-edged sword. Especially when 25-30% of revenues come from amazon. I don't like buying companies which growth prospects are halted by other competitors with DTC edges. Corsair has a great brand image. But is it worth 4b\~ time will tell.
2021-05-04 09:09:43,stocks,"Why are you acting so emotional. 

This is someone providing a genuine bear thesis, which is useful. Even if you don‚Äôt agree with it it‚Äôs worth thinking about potentially downsides for a trade.

My personal view is that young generation of gamers are continuing to shift over to the PC space. 

You mention around GameStop & Amazon - a potential squeeze in margins. however with their reputation and size these partnerships will in my mind increase either footfall or direct untapped commercial opportunities.

Corsair will just continue to horizontally or vertically integrate, and bring their brand reputation & quality with it."
2021-05-04 10:27:36,stocks,Considering Corsair doesn't sell webcams...
2021-05-04 09:25:59,stocks,Yes I see the point - dependency on a big retailer that might vertically integrate and compete later. Pontentially that's why they are moving to the streaming / content creation arena (I assume also its higher margin as it might in part be software with 0 marginal cost)... but that's me hand-waving now.
2021-05-04 08:57:31,stocks,If your conviction and DD were good at 43 the stock should look significantly more attractive at 33. Selling instead of buying at that point is moronic unless something dramatic changes about the company which did not happen in this case.

( X ) Doubt -- no reason to try and sell me on some bullshit, even Nintendo isn't at 10 p/e

To put 30 p/e in perspective, that's right around where some other bloated gaming stocks are that have clearly peaked. In this category we might put EA and Activision.

Do I think the p/e is going to go lower? Sure. The company's own guidance doesn't really think so, but I'm an optimist. I'm such an optimist I'll say Corsair Gaming's own finance wiz kids are wrong, and the p/e will go as low as 26 on revenue alone -- which would obviously be great. 

But 25 p/e is a hefty premium just for the word ""gaming"" in an otherwise normal hardware company"

2021-05-04 07:12:18,stocks,"Similar yes, same stock no. For example sell Spy to realize loss in taxable and buy Voo in Ira."
2021-05-04 08:02:49,stocks,"i believe you are, as the IRA is your account, but considered a 3rd party as you don't have access until retirement."
2021-05-04 07:54:31,stocks,"Thanks, let's say one has options the equivalent of 100 shares, you sell the options at a loss in the taxable account.  You have a position in an IRA 100 shares of same stock and you sell covered calls against that position (within 31 days), is this a wash sale in the taxable account.  I think no, not a wash sale?"
2021-05-04 08:03:10,stocks,"No wash sales with options themselves afaik. If for any reason the options get exercised and buys/sells the same underlying within 30 days, that counts as a wash sale, if a loss was realized."
2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Is there a simple way to outperform S&P 500? Hi guys!

Have a question regarding outperforming S&P 500 - I am investing about 3.5 years and my portfolio growth only 35%, but S&P 500 growth is 58% (with dividends) for the same time.

Hence I have a question - is there a way to outperform S&P 500 in long term? Show me the way guys"
2021-05-04 06:09:25,stocks,"yes. if you hire hundreds of analysts, buy news coverage and press releases to support your analysts, have enough buying power to move markets on your own, then  yes, you can have higher returns than the SPY. 

if you maintain a dedicated discord, pum&dump OTC and extremely volatile stocks to a massive herd of idiots, then yeah. or do it with a subscription service and call it idiotic charlatan,. then you can outperform the spy. 

as a trader you can outperform it as well. most never will . most haven¬¥t done it. consistently that is. 

&#x200B;

BUT the reality is: for MOST, buying index based funds is the easiest and most secure way (and cheapest as well) to get S&P returns. 

its not fancy, its not cool. but it nets results."
2021-05-04 05:46:09,stocks,"If there was an easy way to do it, don't you think absolutely everyone would?"
2021-05-04 06:59:00,stocks,"Do you know anyone who has beaten the US stock market for a period longer than 15 years? Or do anyone you know, know a someone who has beaten the US markets for a period longer than 15 years? 

The financial industry love selling dreams and hopes to people (both rich and poor) that there is a way to beat the market if you buy this stock or a list of stocks. Then they get creative with selling you derivative products, options contracts being the most common one. The entire industry makes money off of people who are chasing this ‚Äúdream‚Äù of beating the market... and for what reason? To fluff your ego, to tell others that you beat the market? 
The United States stock market has been in existence since the late 1800s and there isn‚Äôt one single human being, not one, who has beaten the market for a period longer than 15 years. People love, actually people love to quote a false narrative that Wallstreet firms have put out, when they quote Peter Lynch saying he beat the market for 13 years. That is another lie, 10 out of those 13 years Peter Lynch managed Fidelity‚Äôs Magellan fund, the market outperformed. If you had faith in Lynch, and held on to your investment for all 13 years, sure you would have come out beating the market when you average everything.
But you need to ask yourself, do you think you have the stomach to go through that volatility, when you‚Äôre constantly filled with FUD and tempted with the next best crypto or NFT or real estate or whatever hottest IPO out there?"
2021-05-04 05:53:34,stocks,Depends on your risk tolerance. Nothing stops you from buying TSLA calls and selling them later on but this can work against you too

2021-05-04 07:42:13,stocks,"It's possible, but retail traders are at a disadvantage since most of the market (~58%) is made of passive funds that are managed by large institutions. Mutual, ETF, IRA, 401k.. 

You're at a disadvantage because
1. You likely have to go to work from 9-5 and don't have as much time to research larger macro trends occurring. Think Bonds, Inflation, technical indicators.

2. And more importantly, you never know when those massive funds all decide to change sectors and rotate. You can be up 50% one month and find yourself down 30% within a few months because large institutions start rotating out of positions."

2021-05-04 06:17:04,stocks,"Simple? No, the opposite is the case. The S&P 500 growing is not lead by the giants in them, but because it covers such a large area that the few that manage to have major growth upset the entire balance and cause the increase. The only way to outperform this would be by consistantly finding those growth companies and investing into them beforehand, but if that would be so easy anyone would do it."
2021-05-04 06:47:09,stocks,"Want to increase your performance by 65%? Then buy the S&P 500 etf and be done with it haha. If you are willing to accept more risk and put more effort into managing your trades, then sure you can beat the S&P 500 by swing trading growth stocks."

So when I contribute to my Roth IRA, I buy the index with half and try to beat it with the other half.

2021-05-04 07:22:18,stocks,"I‚Äôm glad you mentioned Buffett. That is another name that the industry loves to abuse. Benjamin Graham who mentored Buffett during his early days did run a fund which beat the US market for a period a little more than 10 years. Buffett did follow that strategy when he managed the Buffett Partnership for about 10 years until he realized it is impossible to deal with human greed. Graham followed a strategy back in the day of spending hours going through a company‚Äôs financial statements to identify large cap stocks that are severely undervalued. This strategy is out there now, with many people thinking they will identify some hidden treasure, and as such Graham‚Äôs strategy no longer works, which he himself confirmed in the 1975 updated version of his book ‚ÄúThe Intelligent Investor‚Äù. If you are capable of not falling asleep while reading through a Finance textbook, ‚ÄúSecurity Analysis‚Äù by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd will explain the fundamental analysis Graham used to follow, which Buffett used in his early days. 
Nowadays, the industry shares a lot of false information, misquoting Buffett for the things he has said. If you look deep into it, you will realize an individual named Warren E. Buffett who files his taxes as ‚ÄúMarried filing jointly‚Äù did not beat the US stock market. On the other hand, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. whose stock trades on the NYSE has had a better return that the S&P 500 for a period little over 30 years. Berkshire is the only exception to the rule.

There is a theory in Accounting literature called ‚ÄúThe Efficient Market Hypothesis‚Äù which simply states no one individual/ organization has knowledge more than the collective market. During the older days this theory was hated on by Wallstreet firms because this will run them out of business. But technology nowadays has made things so efficient, that any information about a company is made available to the public within a matter of seconds.. 
If you want a simple answer to your question, ‚ÄúThe Little Book on Common Sense Investing‚Äù by Jack C. Bogle will show your the numbers and the statistical formula that you can use to calculate for yourself why it is a loser‚Äôs game to try to beat the market. Or if you‚Äôre someone who likes dealing with complicated Accounting terms to finally get the answer you are looking for, start with ‚ÄúThe Intelligent Investor‚Äù, then study ‚ÄúSecurity Analysis‚Äù and then try to see if you can put it into practice. You will eventually accept this concept called ‚ÄúReversion to the mean‚Äù which shows you why no one has beaten the market for more than a decade."

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

The rotation will likely continue for a while into other sectors, but the weird thing is that judging by how much the indices are growing, there's not just rotating but a lot of money coming into the market. 

It almost feels like it's creating a recovery bubble while tech dries out. It's hard to know what to get into at this stage, but I'm buying tech. If we ever do manage to get over the uncertainty, things will pop. Personally, I will be continuing to add to Amazon while it stays under 3.5k."

My question is it a good idea/time to increase my ammount or no?

For example what happenes if I increase the ammount by $100 (put $100) more? Am i gonna buy more at the current price or its like I am buying more shares at the initial price I bought them? So if i increase my amount by $100 am i gonna be winning $900 ($450x2 because i double my initial investment) or it doesnt work that way?

Thanks for the help.

Most don‚Äôt understand wtf is going on in this market, including myself. And like most I make up my own story in order to be at ease and decide what to buy /sell. 

Overall think the explanation is quite easy and straightforward. ‚ÄúTHE MARKET IS CONSTIPATED‚Äù Since last year it ate a ton of sh## SPACS, sh## EV stocks, wanna be vaccine wanna be biopharma companies & dinosaur brick & mortar retailers who sold 3 garments online and think they deserve a multiple expansion and just avoiding their unavoidable demise. 

The market is actually so constipated it can‚Äôt seem to move or pick a direction and forget about allowing the crown jewels; MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, GS, JPM etc making a more than deserved move upwards after blow out earnings reports & guidance. 

But we all have been constipated at some point on our lives.  And we also know the only true and efficient remedy is to take a massive DUM* and get rid of all the sh##.  And let‚Äôs face it, it‚Äôs not whether it will happen it‚Äôs just a question of when.  And after last week and yesterday it may be much closer than we all may all think."

Ex: if you bought in 2007 right before the crash (almost -40% loss in just a year),

sp500 in 2007: 1477  
sp500 in 2008: 1220   
sp500 in 2020: 2600 (+76% since 2007)

I just wanted to show you this to prove that you are perfectly fine. As long as your time horizon in 15 or more, you have nothing to worry about. When you start getting close to retirement, then you need to think about transitionning into very stable/safe strategies.

2021-05-04 10:13:40,stocks,"For me, either broader index ETFs or individual stocks. Sector ETFs tend to have higher fees and I used to find myself buying them specifically for 1-3 holdings. So I just bought those holdings instead"
2021-05-04 10:39:51,stocks,Too soon.  Wait a month or two this isn't gonna be quick.
2021-05-04 10:40:38,stocks,I've got multiple expirations at this point. Just have to have the right goal with each one. Whether it's just a point or two bounce or getting back up there into the mid 80s I think. I mean everything sucks but at least AMD is the best performing of my semi watchlist today
2021-05-04 07:33:11,stocks,Might be 5 percent again if you hold too long
2021-05-04 07:32:07,stocks,"You should sell like 50% and let it run with some sort of a stop loss. 2100 is a lot of money, you wouldn't want to see that money go back to where it began."
2021-05-04 08:59:54,stocks,"I ditched Baba before and during the March correction. We still don't know the full extent of what the Chinese government intends to do with this company. Sadly, Baba has become a stayaway until we have better guidance for what the future holds there, regulation-wise."

2021-05-04 08:45:51,stocks,Same. Now if I could just be more productive..lol. I spend the early morning on premarket chat.. launch into work at the bell and causally peek during the day.

We'll see what it does when market opens. Holding my 120 shares until it hit 45$ again, however long that takes. Its a profitable growing company, consistently beating earnings, good balance sheet (reduced debt this quarter) - no harm in holding."
2021-05-04 08:28:35,stocks,Hmmmmmm. Good pointers here. I havent seen that confirmed but if its true thanks for the heads up
2021-05-04 07:15:42,stocks,Oh just their trailing 12 month eps went up 5x and quarterly earnings are almost up 5x. Over 2x from before pandemic

Yoloing into COIN at its absurd launch price? Selling good stocks to buy speculative crap when those stocks are in the middle of a correction? Tying ARKX to a separate ARK etf (PRNT)?

Cathie's recent moves have me very skeptical of her actual investment skills. I think she did well during the speculative bubble of 2020 but prior to that her etf returns seemed pretty meh"
2021-05-04 10:09:28,stocks,I honestly don‚Äôt even know. The market been so bad since February that anything you invest in won‚Äôt see growth
2021-05-04 10:07:59,stocks,\>D
2021-05-04 10:21:13,stocks,Lol
2021-05-04 09:11:49,stocks,"Same here lol, bought 4 calls when it dropped to $79 now it just looks like bears are taking control, amd is actually undervalued and beat earnings.."
2021-05-04 09:45:05,stocks,We are really struggling to get this inflation that everyone talks about non stop since Biden took over. People do realize deflation is a bigger problem and we've been hearing about hyperinflation 10 years now right? We literally need inflation and all that we have is the promise that it's coming.
2021-05-04 09:55:02,stocks,"What I don‚Äôt get is if people are worried about inflation, how is cash better?  Why sell?"
2021-05-04 10:06:34,stocks,I sell options today was ok
2021-05-04 10:10:53,stocks,"Yeah, if the Nasdaq is not bouncing, you're going to see ARKK fail where it bounced back in March. While ARKK doesn't have to follow them tit for tit, it'd help if it was doing well.

And to be honest, the Nasdaq is in serious trouble imo. I don't really think it revisits its intraday low from March 5th, but given that tech earnings have been front ran apparently the last few times, it definitely could have more to go."
2021-05-04 10:22:43,stocks,I feel attacked.
2021-05-04 10:06:42,stocks,"Yep.  Def my plan and it's worked wonderfully.  But, it's still bullshit collusion and price manipulation at the top."
2021-05-04 10:09:12,stocks,If you're na√Øve enough to think that its that easy to move the mega cap price this drastic overnight...then sure!
2021-05-04 10:05:55,stocks,"Respectfully, bullshit.  ""Taking profits"" doesn't move the stock price like that in mage cap.  It takes collusion along with playing the financial media.  John Q Public can take his $500, or $500,000 profit all day long and the price won't move."
2021-05-04 09:18:59,stocks,"Im up 60% atm, was up almost 100% at some point. It‚Äôs a constant rollercoaster"
2021-05-04 10:04:44,stocks,I'm down 10% over the past week
2021-05-04 09:58:42,stocks,Already have some JPM. Went ahead and added some BRK-B and MT. And I‚Äôm watching SBUX and LOW. Not all Dow stocks and maybe not all ‚Äúboomer‚Äù ones but things I‚Äôve been eyeing to offset my tech
2021-05-04 09:46:38,stocks,Speculative tech lately goes down when the market is down and goes down when the market is up. Not a great time.
2021-05-04 09:47:50,stocks,"Yeah, i feel like my entire portfolio is filled with longish term ‚Äúbright future‚Äù stocks but damn it‚Äôs hard when all my money is divided up among them so i can‚Äôt sell them off yet and go somewhere new until one finally pops off and make the gains they are predicted on going to"
2021-05-04 10:24:27,stocks,What exactly did you buy? get something like AAPL and you will end up in green
2021-05-04 10:13:14,stocks,Inflation fears maybe ?
2021-05-04 09:44:39,stocks,"Sell in June, see you soon


Sell in July, just go die


Sell in August, eaten by locusts


Sell in September, green you‚Äôll see never

Sell in October, mangled in a snow blower

Sell in November, it‚Äôs a life ender

Sell in December, wait to be dismembered"
2021-05-04 08:41:54,stocks,Kinda like how christmas shopping is starting in September now? lol. Enough societal pressure alreadYYY! :-D
2021-05-04 10:07:50,stocks,"Anyone in their 20s or younger (bulk of meme stock investors and crypto buyers) are too young to really remember impact of 2008, and have just seen a massive bull run in the last decade. Similar to me in early 30s remembering but not really experiencing the tech crash from the 90s. 

All this investment winning has led to greed and overconfidence. A LOT of people are putting in money either on margin or that they cant afford to lose. Spend any time in a crypto community and you will here shit like ""10% - 20% returns? enjoy getting rich at 60 lol!"". People are not satisfied right now making 8%, 12%, 15%, etc. it's absurd.

As Buffet says, a lot of people are going to be caught swimming naked when the tide goes out"
2021-05-04 06:03:43,stocks,Out of curiosity what has you worried?
2021-05-04 06:05:17,stocks,"Genuine question - what are you hoping / planning for?

Even after yesterday's close, ETSY is still up roughly 283%, year on year.  If it's undervalued, what do you see as being a fair value?"
2021-05-04 08:55:12,stocks,Mining for REM and Li is not doing good atm either lol.
2021-05-04 10:32:18,stocks,Woof. Hang in there brother and average down where possible.
2021-05-04 10:35:47,stocks,"It's the best time to buy it in nearly a month, but could it be a better time later this week?"
2021-05-04 10:13:03,stocks,Down over 6% today too
2021-05-04 10:14:37,stocks,"Way to plug/pump a completely unrelated stock.

This sub is hilarious."
2021-05-04 10:14:29,stocks,It‚Äôs not is it
2021-05-04 10:36:25,stocks,Earnings and outlook should be good.
2021-05-04 10:05:03,stocks,Just wait. Wait until CPI data on the 12th releases. 74/75 is very a reasonable entry point
2021-05-04 08:49:11,stocks,"What your think about REMX, PICK, and COPX"
2021-05-04 10:24:58,stocks,Alright. Angel on the right shoulder wins.
2021-05-04 09:58:13,stocks,Boomer stocks that I want to buy are up or flat. Dumb.
2021-05-04 10:03:11,stocks,Not really.
2021-05-04 09:45:14,stocks,Google has actual monopoly though.
2021-05-04 06:54:18,stocks,"Incorrect. Russell 2k has not recovered, so yes you're specific value small cap etf is the outlier"

2021-05-04 10:23:06,stocks,"Thanks for the advice, I‚Äôm 20 btw"
2021-05-04 10:19:15,stocks,Didn't that happen last year?
2021-05-04 10:09:20,stocks,o fuck u serious? sell
2021-05-04 09:02:45,stocks,"I just want to know which stocks are pushing the indexes to ATHs, cause mine certainly aren't"
2021-05-04 10:12:51,stocks,"That's the key issue is people who bought in within the last several months haven't seen any returns at all for the most part. At least nothing of note. Every time it looks like it's finally going to break loose, it pulls back. It is very frustrating for many. It is easy to shrug off for the folks that are up 50 - 60% because they got in last year or even further back."
2021-05-04 09:12:14,stocks,I just think that shows how some people have unrealistic expectations and are also impatient.
2021-05-04 09:06:37,stocks,Then why bail now?
2021-05-04 09:09:11,stocks,MSFT was at it's high one week ago and is down less than 5% since. During a general down week.
2021-05-04 09:14:28,stocks,Tech hit all time highs in Jan and Feb. That won‚Äôt happen every month
2021-05-04 09:00:15,stocks,"Yeah, that would be utter nonsense if it worked like that. Infinite free money if one of your stocks goes up by a cent."
2021-05-04 10:16:41,stocks,"yep, this has been long overdue and a 1% spy drop is probably not the right time"
2021-05-04 10:04:43,stocks,Pe is sub 30 now.  At todays price its somewhere at 27.
2021-05-04 10:15:13,stocks,Would stocks not inflate as well?
2021-05-04 10:10:07,stocks,Inflation headlines will be with us for months no need to rush in now
2021-05-04 09:25:22,stocks,I was early and I have paid for that.  Now it‚Äôs my turn.
2021-05-04 10:34:52,stocks,Ended up just doing it on spy
2021-05-04 10:03:56,stocks,"SPY hits ATH almost every week: ""This is normal""

SPY goes down 1%, red day ""JFC the market is crashing"""
2021-05-04 10:02:59,stocks,Just angry that I thought I buy the dip then this shit happens a week later
2021-05-04 09:57:53,stocks,Sure but pretty much everything else is bleeding like crazy and had not recover since yet since the last one.
2021-05-04 10:13:07,stocks,i‚Äôm liking the dip today for a potential buy. isn‚Äôt that a short term etf though?
2021-05-04 10:24:41,stocks,This is the way
2021-05-04 09:07:47,stocks,"Jesus Christ you weren't kidding, I could only read a few comments back in their history. That's a terrifying glimpse into someone's mental health."
2021-05-04 09:06:56,stocks,"And I will continue to, because of people like you pumping it up every single day.  People should know this stock sucks."
2021-05-04 10:40:34,stocks,Good advice. Thx
2021-05-04 07:34:55,stocks,Nah doge has too big of a cult following now. If I lose it all I wouldn't be mad anyway this was a gamble originally but it feels less so now. Doge is on a steady climb upwards. 1 dollar is gonna happen sooner then alot of people think. Even at 1 dollar that's only 128 billion market cap. 5 to 10 dollars can and probably will happen
2021-05-04 07:33:00,stocks,Nah I'd be selling too low here. I do plan on selling half eventually though
2021-05-04 08:27:16,stocks,Skipped that one actually. Was semi hard at 24.. but I think it keeps sliding and revenue projections are a little ..... not there. Could pop if youre a 2-5 year hold and maybe an average ALL the way down.
2021-05-04 09:49:21,stocks,When you buy the dip but it dips further....
2021-05-04 10:20:22,stocks,Mines fucking $107. I bought right near the top and haven‚Äôt been able to average down much. I wonder if I should just sell and reallocate at this point
2021-05-04 08:05:01,stocks,This stock has a pattern of going slightly above 40 and then selling of to 35 or a little higher every week. I had enough of the pattern and sold at 41 long ago but dont be surprised if you see this go to 40 and then back to 35 just hours later
2021-05-04 08:14:13,stocks,Probably worded my comment a bit wrong. With the earnings being better I expected a bit more than 56 cents up. We saw a nice steady rise leading into the financials being released in February but it felt like it was widely expected to be a blow out. Think I was too optimistic on a pre market knee jerk reaction if there was a good estimates beat this morning. Hopeful for the rest of the day! Sitting at a $37 average. Relatively new to the stock market so maybe looking at historic data and trends over volume and general sentiment.
2021-05-04 08:29:36,stocks,Nvm. its true. !remindme 8 days. Whatcha gunna buy?
2021-05-04 10:32:58,stocks,Yeah I agree. The recent adjustments in her holdings don't bring any confidence either. Too much speculative stocks.
2021-05-04 09:39:34,stocks,"I hate my life, lol--and I hate myself even more for liking AMD.  It's like an abusive relationship."
2021-05-04 10:02:25,stocks,I would say that people are probably rotating out of Apple and into other stocks.
2021-05-04 10:28:32,stocks,Selling covered options is great and smart if done correctly. Buying options is gambling as arguably bad in the long run. Unpopular opinion but I strongly believe that. Theta gang
2021-05-04 10:17:09,stocks,Rippp. Hodling with ya üôè
2021-05-04 10:12:35,stocks,"Yeah I consolidated and sold almost of my speculative low cap stocks. Most of my money is now in ETFs and crypto. Individual stocks I hold are aapl, msft, CTXR, agtc, and fb. I do have some money in the arkw and arkf just because I like their holdings"
2021-05-04 10:26:01,stocks,AAPL is down 3% ytd...
2021-05-04 06:39:33,stocks,"Meant to say overvalued, I have great faith in their business operations but just feel like its inflated right now."
2021-05-04 06:48:06,stocks,Guidance from companies like PINS hasn't been great. Personally expect etsy to crush earnings (like amazon did) but give weak guidance about slowing user growth once the pandemic ends - and stock price tanks. Holding 25 shares at $202; and I don't sell at a loss so currently looking like this is gonna be a very long hold. I hope I'm pleasantly surprised.
2021-05-04 06:38:48,stocks,"Sorry misspoke meant overvalued, but that could just be me doom reading"
2021-05-04 08:56:46,stocks,But that is where the money is. Government policy low emissions includes EV + Clean Energy + self-suficient in mining
2021-05-04 10:17:00,stocks,So are you saying I should buy some more PLTR?
2021-05-04 10:15:59,stocks,"just dont consider the effort you put in wasted

youre probably better off than a lot of folks

lots of ppl just gambling here. doing research is good"
2021-05-04 07:05:44,stocks,"You're kidding? The Russell 2000 is barely below ATHs, and it's still up by nearly 20% YTD. Truly a brutal beatdown for small cap... When you say 'correct another 10-20%' I guess you mean correct another 2-3%? Yeah, you're right, small cap is getting absolutely demolished right now, it's totally not only the highly speculatively stocks with ridiculous valuations :)"
2021-05-04 09:06:06,stocks,"Well, I just looked at the 1 month charts for AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, SHW, TGT which I hold all and they're all up"
2021-05-04 09:44:07,stocks,mine either. only the ones on my watchlist.
2021-05-04 09:13:42,stocks,Lots of young new investors that want quick gains. I have my hands in both pies and trying to forget about my investments and let the money grow over time.
2021-05-04 09:12:14,stocks,"I don't think anyone is bailing, just 'freaking out' as the other guy said. I'm getting annoyed by it, but not selling a thing."
2021-05-04 10:12:56,stocks,Agreed so the price right now is fair. Appl‚Äôs p/e is usually between 20-35. Basically the stock is stuck between 117-140 right now barring any shocking news.
2021-05-04 10:23:20,stocks,"Yes but mostly defensive, cyclical stocks such as banks, miners, consumer staples with high pricing power."
2021-05-04 10:18:40,stocks,"I think most of the people saying that are people holding a lot of speculative stocks. They are nowhere near aths and on days like today they sink even further.

2021-05-04 09:45:42,stocks,"The stock doesnt suck, its a winner by literally every metric.  If AMZN is a bad stock then there are no good stocks lol"
2021-05-04 10:05:19,stocks,You have the be extremely bad at this if you‚Äôre losing money with Amazon.
2021-05-04 09:58:50,stocks,Relevant username.

2021-05-04 07:36:12,stocks,"You do you, but some catalysts are that Elon Musk has said he'll say something on Doge coin on SNL. It could very well be a buy the rumour, sell the news situation. At the end of the day, it's your choice, but that money, but I've been in your situation multiple times, and each time I regretted not selling some of my holding. Sure it could go to $0.70, but it could also go to $0.20"
2021-05-04 08:28:01,stocks,Dude their test flight is this month. It'll pop on the 10th during earnings when they report when their test flight is
2021-05-04 08:26:23,stocks,">Sitting at a $37 average. Relatively new to the stock market 

CRSR is one of those stocks everyone forgets about for months until it suddenly flys 50% in a week. Let it sit; the market will eventually price crsr fairly. Its just current risk off sentiment thats causing small caps to get destroyed and large caps/indexes to fly. Will eventually turn the other way (september-october, when inflation subsides is my guess)"

2021-05-04 10:19:42,stocks,"Yeah, probably dozens of hours comparing their growth, to their potential to their long term investments. And then seeing the price of the stock, and right now it‚Äôs crashing because of crypto. My main share is Volkswagen in case you are wondering."
2021-05-04 07:11:01,stocks,"Lol not sure if you're serious

IWM corrected 10%

Speculative stuff corrected 20%

Look at the charts. Obviously there are a lot of differences in such a broad category

In contrast, large caps barely dropped at all during this period. My statement stands"
2021-05-04 10:14:08,stocks,Compared to the general stock market i would say that makes apple cheap imo. Apple is fairly valued while the entire market is highly valued. Not that that means apple needs to go up. I just feel like it should be samewhat safer in the long run.
2021-05-04 10:28:20,stocks,things like MTOR which just had wonderfull earnings... and low PE

You're now telling me the Russel 2000 dropped 10%... okay? It is barely down 3% from it's peak. Small caps have recovered, especially value small cap funds, which are well on their way to breaking into new all time highs, take a look at: AVUV, VBR, SVAL, USSC. These are not obscure outliers, these are ETFs any investor with half a brain would dedicate a portion of their portfolio to.

2021-05-04 06:09:35,stocks,"In mid-late February 2020, the market grew increasingly weary with the 'Rona about. I am a rather pessimistic individual, so I already operated under the assumption that a crash would come soon. The only question was when and how bad it would be.

Then came February 24 and 25, Monday and Tuesday. Monday was such a bloodbath that cycle breakers triggered repeatedly. It's one thing for individual stocks or even sectors to trigger a breaker, but this was different. I am in Europe and by the time NYSE opened, we already had been having a complete bloodbath and breaks for almost 6 hours. Pre-market North America was so red, breaks would take place immediately after open.

That was my cue. I was watching it go on for a few hours, then placed stop loss orders on all my non-essential stocks and even sold some on the spot. My stop losses were set so that the following day would allow for about half of the losses from Monday to reoccur in hopes that things would ease up. But Tuesday was like 80-90% as bad as Monday. I was at work and my phone buzzed with notifications. This was sold, that was sold, and that was just Europe. A few hours into NYSE and I was sitting on piles of cash.

At this point, I was hoping things would crash much more.

Not even one month later, I felt like many of my stock interests were severely undervalued without good reason. Not only were they undervalued in my eyes, I also felt that if things didn't improve overall, we would be screwed way harder than with just a simple stock market crash. So I started buying again."

2021-05-04 07:54:13,stocks,"Depends on the sector. I felt like a 30%+ drop in some sectors largely unaffected by the pandemic was an overreaction. Finance and tech where I traditionally invest a lot, but also others looked undervalued to me and were functioning normally.

Working in software consulting I was in contact with customers from various sectors constantly, from pharma to construction to software, and they all had the luxury problem of having so many orders that they couldn't follow through. The world was supposed to stand still, but it didn't. It couldn't, or we would all be screwed. That's the realization that grew in me, and with that I was convinced the market oversold. Some companies would even thrive in this environment.

By mid-March, the sell-off had largely slowed down or stopped completely and I was waiting for a sign. As soon as the moving average convergence divergence showed a likely break out on MSFT (probably my highest conviction stock), I started buying more of that and LOGI (another one I always liked; everybody needs equipment to work from home). Both have more than doubled since, and so have other stocks.

Didn't put all my money back in at once of course, but by the first week of April I had reinvested most what I had cashed out earlier."

2021-05-04 00:44:49,stocks,"This was leveraged risk. It wasn't overt, but covert stock buying using open market purchases (plus derivative ""swap product"" offered by the big banks).

 These swaps were kept off Archegos books (so they could manipulate shares in a stealth fashion).  The swaps were ""invisible"" to the investing public.

The stocks were purchased by Credit Swiss, J.P. Morgan, and Goldman Sachs. Next sold back a ""derivative"" swap product to Archegos. This process hide the fact Archegos was pumping the market.

This was fraud. It allowed Archegos to keep buying shares of CBS, Discovery, etc. through the use of derivatives by driving up the price of these shares (because he was the only one buying them in the first place).

It was a classic pump and pump using an exotic financial product. The problem arose  when CBS saw the share prices going up so the decided to ""take advantage"" of the rising stock price by issuing new shares to take in revenue.

This new issuance of shares by CBS devalued the share price. As the shares started to plummet (because of the new issuance of stock) Archegos who was leveraged on both the stock and derivatives ""swaps"" started to be in the red real fast. 

The banks got scared because they were the ones who sold Archegos these swaps to begin with (and in order to cover their pussy asses) they involuntarily started to liquidate Archegos positions.  The banks started to get their nuts squeezed.  So they began dumping CBS and Discovery (without explicit permission)  in order for them not to be crushed by a bad trade.

Simple."
2021-05-04 09:28:19,stocks,"Total return swaps aren't any riskier than the cash-market equivalent to the derivatives position.

When an institution wants to buy a stock, they don't commit the full amount of capital. They finance the purchase of the stock just like how you and I would finance the purchase of a home with a mortgage: they borrow the money, buy the stock, and then put the stock up as collateral to reduce the riskiness of the loan from the lender's perspective so that they can secure a lower interest rate on the loan. That securitized interest rate is known as the repo rate across repo and securities lending markets.

Since the buyer can finance the purchase entirely with borrowed money, the net amount they had to pay today is $0 but they'll have to pay interest in the future. The same exact cash flow structure is reproduced with total return swaps. The buyer will enter into a contract with a bank that's structured so that it's worth zero today. The financing cost that the bank will need to incur to hedge the total return swap on the repo market will be baked into periodic interest payments that the buyer pays every quarter, or at maturity (by raising the strike price of the swap, i.e. the price the buyer would break even at, above the forward price of the stock). Essentially, the bank will just facilitate the ""mortgage"" process for a hedge fund that either wants to stay anonymous or have trouble borrowing the money in exchange for commissions and bid-ask spread.

The reason why Archegos blew up is because (1) they didn't keep enough cash around invested in government bonds to meet margin calls (they essentially didn't make a large enough ""down payment"" on their ""mortgage"" to buffer themselves from going underwater) and (2) they did this on extremely speculative stocks that have already run up 100% in a few months to trigger a short squeeze.

Did I also mention that the cost of financing long positions on hard-to-borrow stocks is actually negative? Because the shares are in so much demand by short-sellers, you will actually get paid interest for lending out the stock you're holding as collateral, which makes it even easier to pay for the cost of leverage."
2021-05-04 00:34:46,stocks,Great videos. Thank you
2021-05-04 06:52:37,stocks,"You are generally correct, except for the fraud part and overall ominous tone.
What happened wasn‚Äôt illegal: they got stock on margin, stock price went down, they were margin called and liquidated.

We can compare Archegos to a retail trader with a lot of money:

Since they were investing their own money, and not others, they didn‚Äôt have to follow strict rules for disclosure of their investments. Like you don‚Äôt have to.

They bought with leverage, which means they didn‚Äôt directly own the stock, their bank owned it for them and kept some of their cash as a guarantee. If you buy on margin, you are in the same position.

In Europe retail traders can buy similar products, CFDs, with much higher leverage than Archegos reportedly used. You can easily get an exposition of 10x your cash, sometimes more, while Archegos was 4 or 5x.

The details of the specific financial products that Archegos or you can buy aren‚Äôt that important, for practical purposes the differences I‚Äôm aware of are:
-	You will get much higher fees being a smaller client
-	The bank will only sell you a much smaller amount of these products (but you can open accounts with multiple banks and buy from each the max amount they will sell you, again like Archegos did!)

I don‚Äôt understand why there is so much interest in the specifics of the contracts Archegos used, like they were some mystique special secret deals ‚Ä¶

There is probably more arcane complexity and glossed over risks and hidden expenses and conflicts of interest in some of the financial and insurance products that banks create to sell to small investors."

2021-05-04 07:57:40,stocks,"Not sure if you are referring to Archegos or their banks.

One reason fo Archegos to not buy stock directly is they wanted leverage.
They had a few billions of cash with which they could buy as much worth of stock. But by using some kind of leveraged contract they could buy multiple times more. Higher potential losses, higher potential gains.

Maybe they wanted the leverage purposely to pump the stock. They did pump the price in practice, buying so much.

Did Archegos want to keep secrecy about its positions? Most likely.

There may be many reasons for secrecy, included in some cases the possibility that the market won‚Äôt like what you are doing and lose faith in the stock you are buying, depending from your reputation and position size.
Or preventing your banks to get cold feet upon fully realizing what a high risk client you are.

There is however a much more urgent and understandable reason to keep secrecy if you own a huge leveraged position: if word gets out, some other big player may bet against you and blow you. Think of a short squeeze in reverse.

*If someone knows you bought a lot of Viacom on margin, and that you will get margin called if Viacom drops 20%, and that you own so much that your eventual forced sale will crater the stock, they could take a huge short position with the specific purpose to push the price down and profit from your destruction.*
This is a real killer reason for secrecy. Don‚Äôt advertise your exploitable weakness."

If there is demand in the securities lending market, generally due to short selling, scarce lending supply, or corporate events, Fidelity may borrow certain eligible securities until either you or Fidelity elect to close the loan.


The biggest so far is that Shares on loan are not covered under Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). However, Fidelity provides collateral at a minimum of 100% of the loan value. In any securities lending transaction, counterparty default is a risk."

By staying in, I was able to take advantage of one of the biggest market winning streaks in years.

That only worked for me because I didn't need the money immediately.  It's my investment for retirement and not for my daily expenses.  If you need that 5k to pay rent or buy groceries or whatever, maybe having it in the market isn't the best bet.

Imagine if this crash had taken a few months to a year, and the recovery was like 2008. I bet way fewer of the new investors would have such a strong ""buy the dip, hold the dip"" attitude"

2021-05-04 08:27:49,stocks,"I would advise to start investing by putting money mainly in passively managed ETFs eg ones that follow S&P 500. This is probably one of the safest bets in the stock market. You won't beat the market that way but at least you will not grossly underperform.

Second, play around with a small portion of your available seed money. Invest in stocks you research on your own and try to feel market sentiment. You will most probably lose money at first, but the experience will be valuable.

 For example, you may invest in a stock before it pumping, thus correctly reading market sentiment. But then you may get greedy and not sell resulting in the stock being dumbed and you holding the bag. Or you will take profits and then see it fall. It s best to lose 100 bucks and feel the sting of loss than YOLOing and then never being able to recover."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Why is NVDA worth so much more than AMD? I'm newer to the game so maybe someone can help me with this.  I am sure I am missing something basic but, looking at their revenue, NVDA is not much more than AMD.  NVDA shows $5 billion for quarterly revenue January 21 and AMD is showing $3.44 billion for the same time period. So roughly, 1.5 times as much revenue.

NVDA is shown being valued at $370 billion and AMD at $97 billion.  That means NVDA is worth almost 4 times as much with only 1.5 times the revenue.  Why is this?  

I like AMD and have been invested since March of last year and plan to keep buying more, but I just wonder why they are worth so much less.  Again, I am sure I am missing something very fundamental here so any input is greatly appreciated."
2021-05-03 23:01:40,stocks,"Other can answer with the more intangible items. From a financial perspective, let's take a look at the 10K's of each company (since this is the last filing of NVDA). Over the last fiscal year, here are some key stats:

Revenue:

NVDA: $16.7B / AMD: $9.7B (hrmmm this seems closer than 4x like you mention, more like 1.7x)

Gross Profit:

NVDA: $10.3B / AMD: 4.3B (Interesting, it appears NVDA has better margins so now we are close to 2.5x)

Income Before Taxes:

NVDA: $4.4B / AMD: $1.3B (Now we are all the way up to 3.4x, so getting close to 4x. This shows AMD has lower margins, and higher comparative expenses).

Net Income:

NVDA: $4.3B / AMD:$ 2.5B (Woah we dropped down to 1.72x. If we look, this is due to AMD having carryover losses and Tax carry forwards that reduced AMD's tax burden and net them returns instead of paying taxes hence why they have more net income than they earned).

So what can we conclude on this? Don't just look at revenue. A company can have an insane amount of revenue, but if they are inefficient or have too many operating expenses, they could potentially have  little to no revenue. Next, comparatively, if we ignore the losses and credits AMD took to boost their net income, NVDA is actually coming close to that 4x difference we are seeing in valuation. That and all the intangibles others are mentioning, and AMD's recent pull back, attribute to the difference."
2021-05-03 23:07:45,stocks,"AMD has only relatively recently obtained such growth. With regards to personal computing, Intel has led on the central processor front for decades in terms of market share, partnerships with oems, and performance. At the same time, NVIDIA has dominated the consumer/professional/gaming graphics card segment, in terms of market share, technology, and performance. 

After building my AMD based PC in 2019, started really paying attention to parts, and news regarding AMD's products. Wife was convinced to buy in at a measly 30-40 a share, IIRC. And they have since performed beyond expectations. Their consumer products do not quite make the very top in terms of overall performance, but their value proposition in consumer products has yielded high growth in terms of adoption, and they are starting to secure deals with OEMs. 

TL;DR AMD is David vs Goliath on the two most important fronts AMD has. If you can consider them a David lol. But they're accelerating in terms of development and market share. I'm so long on AMD."

2021-05-04 04:21:22,stocks,"As someone in an industry that largely depends on video cards (game design), I can give a simple answer. NVDA has a relative monopoly on the space, and have been making partnerships to ensure that their cards are a standard for developers. AMD is beating Intel in the processor space, but demands have expanded much more towards the video card sector recently for various reasons, and I sort of feel like Intel is destined to be a Compaq that has been too slow to adapt.

That said, I think AMD can seriously challenge NVDA, but they need a serious focus on that area which is difficult."
2021-05-04 05:47:40,stocks,"I think there‚Äôs a big elephant in the room that no one is talking about. 

Market cap = share count * share price

Amd is about to print a large amount of shares to purchase Xilinx. This means their market cap should increase even at a stable share price. AMD will by 74% amd stockholders, 26% Xilinx stock holders."
2021-05-03 23:27:31,stocks,"Simply said look at their businesses as well. Speculate forward.

What is next for AMD, producing a better chip ? Their stock price rise seems to be more about can Intel shit itself even more.

What is next for Nvidia, artificial intelligence ?

'' On September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Arm Inc. from SoftBank Group Corp. (TSE:9984) for $40 billion.10 Arm is a U.K.-based semiconductor and software design company specializing in CPU architecture. Nvidia says the acquisition will help it to expand its AI capacities and advance a range of technologies from cloud computing and smartphones to self-driving cars and the internet of things (IoT).11 Nvidia noted in its annual FY 2021 filings that the transaction is expected to close some time in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.12 ''

Looks like Nvidia has always been more universal and are pushing for something big, if they succeed that will be quite the money banger.

Which company would people rather buy for next 5 - 20 years ? Will AMD still be producing better chips than their last one ? Is AMD going to be around or are Intel, Apple and Nvidia going to push breakthrough things AMD can't possibly match ? AMD is quite scarier and riskier investment in that regard. Nvidia on the other hand has bigger stronghold with their GPUs and have a lot of speculative things that could pay off big time.

Disclaimer, i own fuck ton of both equally."
2021-05-04 00:16:13,stocks,I wonder if the market has even properly priced in the chip shortage. I own a lot of NVDA and I'm afraid of a downfall.
2021-05-04 06:48:59,stocks,"My personal opinion is that most analysts and investors aren't that into electronics and tech and dont see the upcoming potential of AMD.
We saw huge impact in the CPU marked with AMDs chiplet technology and following AMDs roadmap its the plan to do the same thing in the GPU market. The upcoming RDNA3 chiplet graphics cards are said to be very, very fast and even much faster what NVidia can offer. There are some very promising leaks and the chiplet designs makes it possible to cut the time to market so AMD could probably be 3-6 monts ahead of Nvidia with even better products in the next GPU cycle.
This leads to better public recognition, probably higher prices and margins and after all higher revenue in graphics segment.

Also AMD is switching to 5nm next year when intel just try to improve its 10nm process. The 6nm APU Rembrandt and the 5nm version 1 year later will surely gain more market share in mobile and OEM market.

For me its most likely that Intel and Nvidia will loose market share to AMD and AMD will increase margins over time.

I think its possible to double the revenue in die upcoming 1.5 years."
2021-05-04 06:52:56,stocks,"Smart money likes to keep retail investor with FUD, so retail will sell low buy high. They can easily manipulate the stock since all stands to gain if they keep the stock low enough to accumulate enough position before letting the retail investor knows that AMD is actually good and everyone should buy. Then they sell to those eager retail and the cycle begins again"
2021-05-03 22:48:18,stocks,"NVDA GPUs are, and have been, the industry standard. AMD just starting to take up some more market share with Ryzen and Thread ripper. 

NVDA market cap is about 3.5x bigger than AMD. NVDA revenue is 16b vs AMDs 10b. They also do a whole lot more. Including AI, Neural Net, and computing for self driving. They have both powerful cpu and gpu chips. 

Not only does NVDA have more going on right now, they also have a stronger future roadmap for growth."
2021-05-04 00:05:36,stocks,"Both companies are highly overvalued....the question is which one has more future potential/risk?  NVidia GPUs reliably outsell AMD GPUs, but lets call that a wash....AMD CPUs beat intel lately(usually not forever), but have super high margins so not very profitable and both chips are likely to be made obsolete by ARM based CPUs from apple and now Nvidia if they make the ARM acquisition....and that's the big one, if Nvidia gets into the CPU race, offering an Apple M1 like product for windows, that's a big hit to AMD(and intel).  Nvidia network compute growth has almost matched it's graphics in just a couple years, so the hype is strong...AMD is kinda running out of steam after beating Intel down the last few years.  given a long enough time period, both will likely meet their price valuations and even go higher, but in a shorter term they are very risky to any market correction.  I will add, AMD does not have a dividend unlike Nvidia(or Intel) so it's a bit harder to hold for very long periods."
2021-05-04 01:08:58,stocks,I‚Äôd say give it a few more years  for them to surpass Nvidia. AMD was always the budget room heater until ryzen and the graphics cards timed with the early ryzen releases were meh. A lot of new architecture they haven‚Äôt yet mastered
2021-05-03 22:46:39,stocks,I believe NVDA makes software for self driving cars.
2021-05-04 01:57:56,stocks,AMD has a lot of comparatively low margin console contracts. Those are good for revenue and pays off a lot of overhead but just isn't as high margin as standalone GPUs or CPUs.
2021-05-04 04:40:26,stocks,They shit money
2021-05-04 05:46:41,stocks,Look at free cash flow and EBITDA. Nvidia is a fair bit higher. I kind of eye balled it but it looked around 4x higher over past 5 years.

AMD is an historical fuckup that got lucky in a couple of big ways and barely avoided a bankruptcy.

2021-05-04 10:13:53,stocks,"That's not the whole story. Most people are buying NVDA or AMD because they expect growth, not just stagnation at current net income levels.

TSLA has lower net income than both AMD and NVDA, but it's market cap is 650B. That's not to mention the loads of other companies with high valuations that are losing money."
2021-05-04 07:43:08,stocks,Same I paper handed my puts but will be riding intel down
2021-05-04 08:04:51,stocks,"AMD has serious supply chain issues, since their silicon flies off the shelves faster than TSMC can produce. NVidia has Samsung fabs to help them out. This will hamper growth for at least another two quarters.

Nvidia has huge additional revenue with their quasi monopolistic AI accelerator chips. This revenue is used to pay an army of software engineers, which is the reason that AMDs software is seen as inferior. For a decade they couldn't compete in that space against Intel and NVidia.

That said, I'm [absolutely bullish on AMD](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=AMD). As soon supply chain normalizes, they will have insane revenue numbers. Due to the new revenue they can finally afford to attack Nvidia and Intel on their home turfs, which is software and mobile devices. AMD laptops are the best deal currently, but nearly unavailable in many regions. People take the Intels instead."

There is more demand on CPUs and GPUs today than there ever was in history, and it won't be met for a long, long time despite gradually expanding production capacities. At the moment they are merely able to prioritize product lines that are the most profitable AND still can't produce enough for their products to be actually available at retail. They are really selling every single chip they can make before it reaches store shelves, and there are many markets they aren't able to even start targeting due to overwhelming demand elsewhere."

2021-05-04 08:16:56,stocks,"I have to slightly disagree with the analyst sentiment. [Based on this](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=AMD), they clearly see the market potential, but not in the short term. As long supply chain issues aren't resolved and their 'quality of life' product improvements don't reach the customer for another six month, there is nothing the management can do. If cargo shipping is still restricted, crypto mining buys bulk product at a huge discount, they just have to wait until things normalize. Then there will a explosion of revenue."
2021-05-03 22:51:38,stocks,"I see AMD revenue at 9.7b for 2020 and NVDA at 10.7b for 2020 (according to wikipedia for both) which leads me back to my original question of why they are worth so much more?

Edit: Correction, 10.9 b for NVDA but still not a big difference.  Your point about the future roadmap for growth does make a lot of sense."

AMD has nothing like this. They seem to have *some* help from Microsoft XBOX/cloud divisions, but that is not even in the same ballpark. The hope is, that AMD can put Xilinx's leadership in the (cloud) network sector to some good revenue, so they can afford more people on the software side."

Having a couple of 100 software engineers sitting around makes a huge difference, but they cost a lot. Supply chain issues for all their chips hamper their possible growth. They could annoy Nvidia in the low end a lot and push for more market share, but the product can't reach the customer. In a year or two, AMD will attack Nvidia, especially in the mass market. Getting CPU and a marketable GPU from one vendor is cheaper for builds and we will see that."

That way, they don't announce earnings when it's crappy like the beginning of May? I feel like all these companies are getting unfairly hit because ""April"" is the month to buy and ""May"" is the month to sell. All tech starting in May is getting hammered, when I feel there's nothing that changed from Friday to Today. Big players control narrative, so it scared maybe one financial firm to start a sell off?"
2021-05-03 23:01:07,stocks,"So FAANG (FAAMG) for example doesn't really matter when it reports.  They all report pretty much at the same time, and suffer the  sell-offs together in the following weeks as people take-profits/get-bored waiting for news and the next earnings season.  And FAANG being such a massive part of the market is going to be a big part of the reason this timing is true-ish.  

But even though the sell-off is almost a guarantee, the % sell-off is usually relative to earnings.  At least usually... I think AMZN is getting particularly hammered as investors are growing frustrated with the lack of split that's been forecasted for forever now.  And is over-due.

With retail investing now becoming more important than ever... don't let anyone tell you that there's no difference between a buyer getting 1 stock @ $3400 OR 10 stocks @ $340.

The hard reality is that many skilled & unlucky get royally f*cked.  

I'll go back to AMZN for example.  Look at any reputable site/bank collating analyst opinions.  The 'Low' for AMZN is way higher than the current price.  And the 'Low' was also higher than the current price in January (the last earnings).

Many lost their shit on options banking on AMZN breaking $3500 in Jan/Feb/Mar... it's now sub-$3500 in May.  After two stellar reports.  

Yet Goog/Googl is now 30% up in that same time frame.

Options are now the rage for some f*cked up reason... and they shouldn't be as they're tools for seasoned investors.

There‚Äôs more to it - the firmly conservative Supreme Court and razor majorities in Congress mean sweeping gun control on the level that could meaningfully impact the industry has a near-zero percent chance of taking root. Gun control advocates have already been let down repeatedly in the first 100 days of the new government. 

And in any sort of ‚Äúhits the fan‚Äù scenario, ammo is a more valuable currency than just about anything other than clean water. Doomsday preppers are on a different level right now, and they‚Äôre moving in larger packs.

...multiple factors contributed to the greatest run on ammo as long as I have been in the industry ..8 years now. ..national emergency with Covid, Civil Unrest, Police Brutality..looting in Santa Monica, CA of all places, Massive influx of new buyers..the list goes on. 

Obama was no match for this.  

It started March 12th 2020 and has been outrageous sales EVERY SINGLE day 417 days in a row!!!!!. Can't keep anyting in stock. Vista has a massive market share(Federal, Blazer, CCI, Speer, American Eagle and now Remington) This is THE ammo stock. They also hold the keys to primer manufacturing which is the reason we are in this mess. The primer shortage caused a backlog and then 10 million new gun buyers wanted to feed their new toys. 

Super Demand City and no Supply easy math. As far as timing..this thing still has some juice left in it I believe and that's because they've had some price increases and recently stated they are behind a billion dollars in orders.

Price Targets range from 35-49. A consensus buy across the board on most outlets.  I believe all time high was 52 and change..it has a serious shot at beating that.  I have personally spent a year watching and running with this stock.  Seriously hours daily researching this for over a year.

The negative is there is low volume to move this thing. It's insane. It has taken a big jump, but over 14 months.

The earnings probably hit 575 million in this report and might break earnings record. It was at 38 not too long ago.  I've owned this since last March at an average of 7.80. I have taken profits twice so far. I now have stock and 35 dollar calls to hit May 21st which are green and also some 40 dollar hail mary calls as well. Those could be dreamers, but I work in this field and it never ends. Phones ringing off the hook..lines all day long.

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"China Wants to Build a $306 Billion Used-Car Market From Scratch Although China has more than 270 million vehicles on its roads, only an estimated 15 million secondhand models were sold in 2019. That‚Äôs in sharp contrast to places such as Australia, the U.K., and the U.S., where people buy more used cars than new ones. So policymakers, intent on stimulating domestic consumption, want to change that. China is aiming to double the size of its secondhand-car market to about 2 trillion yuan ($306 billion) by 2025. To get there, Beijing has slashed taxes on used-car dealers, in May reducing the levy to 0.5% from 3%‚Äîfar less than the 17% tax on new vehicles. It‚Äôs also making it easier for dealers to trade used cars among themselves by classifying a secondhand vehicle without a license plate as a commodity rather than a personal asset, which simplifies the transaction. ‚ÄúThe used-car-trading business is about to enter a brand-new chapter,‚Äù says Xiao Zhengsan, secretary general of the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA). ‚ÄúWe will see more positive policies in this area. Companies such as UXIN can expect to see rapid growth in the coming years as a result."

While expanding at a large rate the auto market is hitting all time highs but it is not sustainable. The Chinese economy is entering a fork and an impossible dilemma on continuing expansion of its middle class while sinking every single penny of GDP into infrastructure and growth. Establishing and growing the middle class takes away from GDP in a developing country whose only resource is cheap labor at cost. The middle class takes away from the labor force and adds to single minded individuals that are risks to the CCPs authority. The services market and domestic private market growth take away from Chinas ability to be the consumer goods power house that has built its economy. As credit continues to rise at unprecedented rates, housing crisis grows, rising military tensions, and historic low birth rates loom that will threaten a weakening slave the Chinese auto market is limited by the growth of the middle class and the infrastructure that continues to move toward investment of public transportation."
2021-05-03 23:14:28,stocks,"Labor force can be replaced by automation as technology advances.  There will always be the service industry for jobs as the Chinese people get richer.

Now you have more impoverished people with less money and nothing to do. Public transportation in cities will replace cars. It‚Äôs inevitable specially at the density in Chinese cities. Cars take up too much space, cost too much money, and are unnecessary. Once China has any economic down turn vehicles will be the first to go because it is not a necessity like it is in the US. China is actually adopting European methodologies on travel and transportation which have moved away from personal cars."

It‚Äôs in this spirit that we‚Äôre excited to announce a new partnership with Discord, the communication service popularized by gamers and used by more than 140 million people every month around the world.

Together, our teams are already hard at work connecting Discord with your social and gaming experience on PlayStation Network. Our goal is to bring the Discord and PlayStation experiences closer together on console and mobile starting early next year, allowing friends, groups, and communities to hang out, have fun, and communicate more easily while playing games together.

To bring these experiences to life for our players, Sony Interactive Entertainment has made a minority investment as part of Discord‚Äôs Series H round. From our very first conversation with co-founders Jason Citron and Stan Vishnevskiy, I was inspired by their lifelong love for gaming and our teams‚Äô shared passion to help bring friends and communities together in new ways. Empowering players to create communities and enjoy shared gaming experiences is at the heart of what we do, so we are beyond excited to start this journey with one of the world‚Äôs most popular communication services.

It‚Äôs always a privilege to work with great partners to bring fresh experiences to our fans, and we‚Äôll have more to share in the coming months. Stay tuned to our channels and @Discord for all the latest updates."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Stop panicking. Come up with a plan. I know some of you are tired of these ""it's ok everything will be ok"" posts, but the daily thread is a mess. Browsing it would make some of you think that the market is down 10%.

If you're looking at your portfolio and it's really doing a number on your stomach, **you need to reevaluate your positions**.

Maybe you took more risk than you wanted to. Maybe you put too much in a risky position. Maybe you bought into the hype. Maybe you thought with your heart and said ""[insert company] will never go away so it must go up!""

Well, you're here now. What's your plan?

**COME UP WITH A PLAN**

Good investors come up with plans. They don't sell on red days or green days. They sell when something happens that changes their initial reasons for buying.

Are you going to hold forever? Are you selling before earnings? Are you selling if it gets to whatever price? Are you going to keep buying? 

You must have a plan. Once you have this plan...

**STICK TO THE PLAN**

Do not deviate. Don't say ""maybe it will come back up"" or ""maybe it will come back down"". Sticking to your plan is crucial. This is how you can manage your risk. It doesn't matter what happens in the next day or week or year. You did what you thought was the best action to take in the moment because you stuck to your plan. In time, you will tweak your plan to maximize your potential and minimize your downside. Don't look back at a position and feel great or bad. Just evaluate whether you made the right decision based on the information you were working with at the time.

**TAKE YOUR EMOTIONS OUT OF THE EQUATION**

Do you think Warren Buffett panics every time there's a red day? Absolutely not. Then why should you? If you let your emotions get the best of you, you WILL do something stupid. The stock market does not care, so why should you?

There are going to be many red days ahead. Are you ready for them?

See you tomorrow!

They don't know what p/e ratio it historically trades at, no DCF valuation, etc. Even if it's a growth-heavy investment, there isn't a real effort to describe how and to what degree they expect the company to grow. If you have conviction that a company you're invested in is currently undervalued, you shouldn't be alarmed by day-to-day price fluctuations and should buy dips that come along the way.

The other reason I think people panic is if they're investing with money they need in the near future i.e. money they shouldn't be investing with in the first place."

With the elec vehicle market boom going on over the next ten years. One of the biggest factors will be a charging network. When cars started getting massed produced. It was gas stations that made the difference. Gas stations multiplied and are everywhere. Plenty of car companies have come and gone. 

Gas stations will be on the way down as the electric car revolution comes. Even though there are a few good competitors for charging stations, EVgo is working in the right direction. They are working with car manufacturers and municipalities. Add in the billions they should be getting from Bidens latest approved Infrastructure bill. EVgo is now the leader of what can be a nationwide network of charging stations. They will have the ability to place charging stations anywhere. Malls to private businesses. 

I expect them to be the first to open a version of a gas station. A group of charging stations along highways with a convienience store and maybe a fast food restaurant. Once this starts, they will excel far beyond any competitor. Then become a household name. Then they win. Sort of how you xerox something instead of photostat copy. Or use a Klenex instead of a facial tissue. The brand will end up selling itself.

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"What‚Äôs your emerging markets play? As many of us may know, many emerging market were growing fast Pre-COVID. With a post-COVID recovery, some may experience the supercharged growth in the 2010s.

PWC released an excellent report a few years back detailing the expected economic size of countries by 2030 and 2050. India, China, Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico were some noticeable growers in the top 10 by 2050. Other countries like Vietnam, Philippines, Egypt, and Nigeria were expected to grow very substantially as well.

Do you have any plans or plays to capitalize on new emerging markets in your portfolio?

My most direct plays are Unilever and TLK (Indonesia Telekom). UL has really positioned itself well in Southeast Asia and Latin America, reaping good results from consumers there. It could be a slight edge over their main competitor P&G in the decades to come. 

As for TLK, there is nothing particularly remarkable about it other than its large and established in one of the world‚Äôs largest growing economies. It‚Äôs solid, stable, and pays a nice dividend. If Indonesia stays stable, it should logically grow with the economy.

These are what I like and are not recommendations. 

Curious to hear your plays. 

As a note, focusing on emerging markets does have risk. Sometimes you are dealing with environments with poor rule of law, corruption or instability. Sometimes currency fluctuations can negatively impact your price. Be smart and be aware of your investing environment."

If you consistently buy a stock when it dips, and then sell it with profit and repeating that with the same stock throughout a steady increase, would you make more than if you just held?

For example, let‚Äôs say you kept going in and out of one position as shown‚Äî- 

Buy: 100 shares at $10
Sell: 100 shares at $15

Buy: 100 shares at $12 
Sell: 100 shares at $16

Buy: 100 shares at $15
Sell: 100 shares at $20

2021-05-04 07:41:25,stocks,"Problem is you can't be 100% sure where the highs and lows will be. If you're trading, each of the timeframes (short/medium/long term) require a different mindset and strategy. Even then, you're working off of probabilities, not definites. Trading isn't for everyone, it's a lot of stress, more stress the shorter the timeframes. Buying and holding long term in a company you believe in will give you a better night's rest at least üòÇ, trading can however potentially give you exponentially better ROI, but it also works the other way if you mess it up.
As an example, this past month I've managed to just over 2x my account, my bloody trading contact did a 2000%ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è(it's real, I saw the account), but that's some aggressive trading and he's really good at scalping the short time frames. I doubt I'll ever in my lifetime be able to do a 2000%. That is not the norm, but I'm saying it just to illustrate it CAN be way more profitable than long term holds, but IT IS more risky too. 

What pisses me off, I see a lot of ads/people pushing trading, but only show the gains, not losses, there's a reason why like 97% of new traders lose money. Risks are high, risk management is so important and its not something people can action properly straight off the bat, you don't always walk away with a win everyday and you need to be able to mentally deal with that without making a losing streak worse and know how to handle that situation. As well as some traders have done this year, it means nothing next year, you can lose your edge in an instant, you just need a few consecutive bad trades and you're done. 

So my advice, if you want to dabble in the trading side, play with a demo account and prove to yourself you can be profitable first. You don't try pilot a jet without getting a licence(training). Even then, portion off a portfolio between investment and trading, make your trading portfolio smaller than your investment portfolio."

If you swing trade: 100\*(3+2+4) = 900$

 Swing trading is a legitimate strategie. But like many others have pointed out, you are likely to miss time the market and miss out on some gains. What I would recommend to you is make two accounts in your tax free saving account; one of them with the strategie to swing trade and the other to keep holding/buying from stable etf. After 3 years, look at the performance of both of them. Then decide if you wanna keep using 2 strategies or if you wanna consolidate to whichever is the better one. Hope this helps"

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 3, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 3, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) ticking higher while the tech-Nasdaq (QQQ) declined. The SPY rose 5% in April, for the best performance since November of last year. Following a rotation into cyclical and reopening stocks at the beginning of the year, April saw the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors lead gains in the SPY, returning to the leadership position. Growth stocks continued underperforming, paring recent gains after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said some sectors of the market appeared ‚Äúfrothy‚Äù. Looking ahead, market participants continue to monitor corporate earnings and wait for more economic data, particularly the April jobs report that will be released May 7th. 

A wave of stronger-than-expected earnings, especially in banks and mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), have fueled the latest rally in the market. In the US, effective distribution of the vaccine and the gradual reopening of the economy have led to a surge in consumer spending, driving corporate profits way past analyst estimates. As of Friday, 86% of S&P 500 companies had beaten first-quarter earnings expectations, according to FactSet data. This would mark the highest proportion since at least 2008, if the current rate holds through the end of first-quarter earnings season.

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March‚Äôs gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

Last week, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said ‚ÄúAmerica was back on the move again‚Äù following the coronavirus pandemic.. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

* Legendary investor Warren Buffet spoke at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting. There were a lot of takeaways, we encourage everyone to check it out.

* Twitter (TWTR)said on Monday it will introduce a new feature to let users charge admission to their live audio chat rooms in its ""Spaces"" feature, as the social media company seeks to court more content creators.

* Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management bought about 1.3 million shares of Twitter Inc worth $71 million last week after the stock fell on disappointing earnings results compared to peers.

just wondering if anyone can help, or point me in the right direction with the following, I'll keep it brief, but if any info is required, please feel free to ask.  


My Mum has about 40k in her current account, obviously earning nothing and slowly depreciating with inflation - She knows that I have been dabbling in the stock market (small figures, a few hundred here or there - Mostly a ""How does that work?"" sort of thing) and has asked for some advice - However my knowledge, risk appetite and goals are very different to hers.  


In short, her situation is as follows:  


\- House paid off with no mortgage

\- Decent pension, pays all her monthly/annual bills, with enough spare for a couple of holidays a year and is able to save for the less frequent expenses, eg a new car when needed.

\- No debt other than a monthly CC used and paid off monthly

\- Circa 40k sitting the the bank doing nowt

I was wondering if putting it into a well diversified ETF, perhaps with a regular dividend, but the choice out there is rather overwhelming, for reference, this is the sort of thing that's coming up in my searches  


 [JPMorgan BetaBuilders US Equity ETF (BBUS) (usnews.com)](https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/large-blend/jpmorgan-betabuilders-us-equity-etf/bbus)   


Can anyone offer any insight into if this is a good call? or if there's anything else out that that might suit her situation? She's very risk averse but having a chat with her she's ""Willing to lose a small amount to try it out"" Which translated to ""a couple of thousand and I'd want to cash out"""

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"WELL Health Vs Cloud MD? Which one should I invest in for my Kids? Advice Needed Hello, 

I‚Äôm going to have kids in the next 5 years, and I wanted to purchase shares in a company and leave it for a decade and gift it to my child when he/she turns 18. I felt telehealth would boom in the upcoming decade so it‚Äôs a great place to find a company of my liking. Problem is, I am torn between two companies. I wanted to ask reddit users your opinion of which one is a better option. 

One was WELL Health (WELL) and the second Cloud MD (DOC) 

**Company Overview: WELL Health Technologies Corp. (TSX : WELL)** 

WELL was recognized as a TSX Venture 50 company in 2018, 2019 and 2020. 

WELL Health Technologies Corp. field is delivering healthcare services. It owns and operates about 2,000 clinics in Canada, reaches over 10,000 physicians and is helping to digitize the process by providing electronic medical records.  

In March 2020, the company launched its telehealth service called ‚ÄúVirtualClinic+‚Äù, which is a digital health communication platform connecting physicians with patients through video, audio and text. 

Recently the company launched ‚Äúapps.health‚Äù, which integrates with a clinic‚Äôs Electronic Medical Record software. This app helps digital health companies and 3rdd party software devs to collab with the company and push them to adopt it‚Äôs products and services

**WELL HEALTH PERFORMANCE**

The company has a current market capitalization of C $1.41 billion. As per the data on TMX, the company‚Äôs profit-to-book ratio is 5.429 and the profit-to-cash flow ratio is 28.10. The year-to-date performance of the stock is a gain of around 50%.

**WELL‚ÄôS** **FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**

Total revenue for the year 2020 ended December 31, 2020, was $50.2 million. Compared to total revenue of $32.8 million for the prior year, an increase of 53% was driven by acquisitions during the past year and the increase in software and telehealth-related revenue. 

WELL achieved Software and Services revenues of $12.3 million for 2020, which was a 393% increase from $2.5million last year. Their profits were $21.2 million, which was a 93% growth based on $11 million last year. WELL had 42.% in their adjusted Gross margin percentage which was 33.% in the previous year. 

**CloudMD Software & Services Inc. (DOC:TSXV)**

CloudMD offers health technology solutions to medical clinics across Canada. They have developed tech to deliver by combining clinics, telemedince and AI

They provide service to over 500 clinics, 4000 licensed practitioners, and 8 million patient charts across Canada and usa.

The company launched CloudMD On Demand, a virtual solution for pharmacies, insurance companies, and employers across Canada to offer their customers easy access to their medical records. 

**DOC'S STOCK INFORMATION**

CloudMD started trading in June 2020. Q4 2020 revenue of $5.8 million; up 138% compared to Q4 2019 and 73% compared to Q3 2020.

The company has a current market capitalization of C$420 million and a profit-to-book ratio of 8.75, with a negative return on equity and assets

**DOC FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**

Q4 2020 revenue was $5.8 million, compared to $2.4 million in Q4 2019. The increase is based on 5 acquisitions completed in the quarter. Without factoring acquisitions the company achieved growth through 

‚óè Due to COVID, the market adopted telehealth services

‚óè New product features.

‚óè Strategic marketing campaigns.

Q4 2020 gross margin was 40%, compared to 44% in Q4 2019. In the current year, the Company placed certain expenses within its income statement to cost of sales, which resulted in an overall decrease in gross margin as compared to Q4 2019. 

Net loss for the Company in Q4 2020 was $5.2 million, compared to $1.5 million in Q4 2019. 

Cloud has $59.7 million in cash. Starting Jan. 1st 2021 they raised another $58.2 million in a bought deal offering in March 2021, which gives a balance around $100 million and above.  

**My own two cents:** 

Based on the above information, WELL does seem to be poised as the better option. On the flip side with Doc trading near $2, I am tempted by the price to throw a few extra dollars for the potential of a faster return. Or should I evenly spread my cash amongst both companies and ride the wave, until I see a definitive winner between the two? 

**Reddit user thoughts?**"
2021-05-04 08:45:05,stocks,u/AardvarkInformal3656 \- What is your reasoning for not choosing WELL? Is there anything specific that stands out to you?
2021-05-04 08:46:33,stocks,"u/Huckleberry_Holliday \- I agree. As a long term hold for future children, an ETF seems a safer route. If an individual wanted to invest and they were in their early 20's and 30's they could get away with investing in individual stocks and the risk that come with it."
2021-05-04 08:47:51,stocks,I dont really have any specific reason. I just think cloudmd has a higher ceiling then well thats why.

I also wanted to start a discussion on your experience with patents especially how they can influence the returns of investors."
2021-05-03 20:32:25,stocks,Interesting topic for someone looking to dig deep into their due diligence. I would think all (good) analysts are aware of IP and when the important patents expire. The analysis could lead to short term drops as well as long term income stability.

I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! This week isn't as spicy as the last, but there's still buckets of money to be made regardless.

&nbsp;

I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- First and foremost, **expect extra volatility this week**. Many of the companies who report this week are *young*, and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their ""true"" values. Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies.

- **Be wary of solar plays**. Enphase got fucking *rocked* last week due to semiconductor shortages plaguing the sector, so such price action may be seen across the other solar stocks as well. That being said, following Enphases drop, many other solar stocks had sympathy drops, so these shortages may be priced in. Regardless, unless you've got some insider news, look to avoid them for now.

- This is kind of a no brainer, but **NKLA puts will print**. First and foremost, the company is a fraud. Second of all, following of ALL of it's earnings reports, NKLA has gone down every single time bar one, where it went up **0%**. You read that right. 0% was the most NKLA has risen following earnings. Sell credit spreads or buy puts. I've got no faith in Trevor Milton.

- **PENN Reports the day before Draftkings**. They usually follow very similar price movement, so you can use this to your advantage. If PENN puts up good numbers and goes up, you can almost guarentee that DKNG will do the same thing the following day when it reports.

- **Beyond Meat MOVES**. Similar to Enphase last week, BYND almost always craters or rockets following an earnings report. Personally, I would avoid this ticker, but the adrenaline junkies are more than welcome to run long strangles if they're within their personal risk tolerance. There's an awesome amount of money to be made here.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin‚Äô companies, theres plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**"

Although the stock has dropped slightly since then and have mostly been trading sideways, I thought I would share my thoughts about this company before they report earnings on May 12.

 

\- **Coupang** ([Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language): Ïø†Ìå°) is a South Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010. It is incorporated in [Delaware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware), [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupang#cite_note-2)

\- Coupang is founded by South Korean businessman Bom Kim who dropped out of Harvard Business School after 6 months.

\- Currently Coupang is the largest e-commerce company in South Korea

&#x200B;

 **Business Model** 

 \- ‚ÄúWe are building the future of commerce‚Äù -- Coupang S-1

\- A key competitive advantage of Coupang is what they call their ‚ÄùRocket Delivery Service‚Äù

\- This includes their Dawn and Same-Day Delivery. Arriving before 7am if ordered before midnight or later in the day if ordered in the morning (this makes purchasing perishable items such as produce convenient).

\- They promise next-day or faster delivery on nearly 100 percent of orders.

\- Coupang claims that 70 percent of the South Korean population lives within 7 miles of a Coupon Logistics Center

&#x200B;

 **Opportunity** 

 

**- Korean Attractive Commerce Market**

Korea is the fourth largest economy in Asia. In addition, South Korea has the following key traits:

* High Mobile Penetration
* Retail Competitive Landscape
* Lifestyle

**- Coupang has an extremely integrated model. From the technology to the distribution**

&#x200B;

 **Risk** 

 

* Operation results might fluctuate significantly
* Future growth rate is hard to predict as the company aims to forgo short-term profitability for long-term growth
* If the company loses its senior executive members, it might not be able to fulfill its current vision.
* The company has had multiple years of large losses.

 

**Financials** 

 

* Total Net Revenue: 11.967 billion dollars (2020)
* Cost of sales: 9.98 billion dollars (2020)
* Operating, general, and administrative expenses: 2.51 billion dollars (2020)
* Operating loss: 527 million dollars (2020)
* Cash and Cash equivalents: 1.25 billion dollars (2020)
* Long-Term Debt: 353 million dollars (2020)
* Total Liabilities: 5.67 billion dollars (2020)

 **IPO** 

 

* Coupang went public earlier this month offering 130 million shares at $35 each, giving the company $4.55 billion 
* The stock closed at $49.25 on its first day.
* Coupang closed at $48.75 today (March 30, 2021). \*41.90 at end of April 30th

 **Valuation** 

 

\- 2020 total net revenue was 12 billion, assuming growth of 100 percent, the 2021 total net revenue would be 24 billion.

\- Using a forward P/S ratio of 5, we get the valuation of 120  billion dollars. Divided by 1.54 billion outstanding shares I get a 12-month price target of **77.922  dollars.**

**- This represents a 60 percent increase from the closing share price today.**

&#x200B;

 **Why We Should Invest in Coupang** 

 

* Household name: There are almost nobody in South Korea now who has not heard of Coupang before. Their status in South Korea is similar to that of Amazon in the US.
* Overseas Expansion: Coupang can achieve such a high-level of revenue and revenue growth without even entering foreign markets. Entering other Asian markets could potentially increase revenue by an even larger percentage
* Rapidly decreasing operating losses. While still not profitable, profitability is definitely achievable within a few years.
* Less political uncertainty: With US-China tensions rising, Coupang is a safe alternative for those who want to invest in Asia.

2021-05-04 00:25:09,stocks,Agreed! They only have something like 4 percent of the Total Addressable Market and they have been showing 70-95 percent year over year quarterly revenue growth for 3 years in a row all without expanding into other countries.

2021-05-04 00:33:56,stocks,"Yea! 
What puzzles me is that analyst reports and some of the comments tend to suggest how overvalued Coupang is and how they aren‚Äôt the Amazon of Korea. Amazon is currently valued at 3K but this is only 40+ with so much upside. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

However, South Korea is extremely competitive and Coupang has come out on top there. I am sure they can succeed in other countries if they put in enough effort. Howevee in my DD I specified that my projections are based on domestic growth only. Imo only considering Korean revenue, CPNG can still grow a lot."
2021-05-03 22:13:43,stocks,"Coupang will certainly continue to have success in SK but I doubt that they even understand the Singapore market and culture well enough to make it there (that's another hyper-competitive market by the way). Japan should be easier for them, but the Japanese market is notoriously difficult to penetrate by foreign firms and SK has recently made itself unpopular there with the discussion about ""comfort women"" and the boycotts of Japanese companies related to that etc. That's not the fault of Coupang but such things matter when you want to attract customers in Japan as a SK company."
2021-05-03 22:15:57,stocks,Yep. I think Taiwan might actually be a better opportunity for them.
2021-05-03 22:28:23,stocks,"Yes, Taiwan should be much easier."
2021-05-03 22:29:40,stocks,Agreed. Less competition and Taiwan consumers are familiar with Kroean companies and products too.
2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"APHA & TLRY Holders - Don‚Äôt panic! Here's what happens to stocks when mergers close... Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, do you own research. 

**TL;DR ‚Äì Some brokers are taking their sweet time with these shares. MOST companies are down day after a merger and then rebound in the coming weeks. Sit tight!**

Ok, so we‚Äôve all figured out what happens to our APHA and TLRY shares now that the merger is closed (Right? Right!). If you‚Äôre still confused, check out [THIS post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aphria/comments/n3uylv/still_dont_know_what_is_happening_to_your_apha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from earlier. 

Feedback on my prior post is that SOME brokers have changed your position to reflect your TLRY shares (TD Ameritrade for the win) and some have not (get your shit together, RH). Either way, you will get those shares (hopefully) soon and all will be well with the world.

BUT WAIT! TLRY is down $1.20 today‚Ä¶ WTF?!? 

A few things to note - There are a lot of market dynamics at play here:

1. There were hedge funds with prior positions that now need to rebalance. 

2. There are people who were only holding on the APHA for the merger and now want to sell.

3. There are ETFs that will likely have some sort of rebalancing.

4. Shorts may be covering on the weakness today.

5. This is a liquidity event ‚Äì expect volatility.

We can expect a decent amount of choppiness around TLRY the next few days. ‚ÄúBut grey\_patagonia\_vest how do you know?!?‚Äù Well kids, I did some good old fashion data analysis. 

I pulled a list of all mergers with the following criteria:

1. Both target and acquirer are publicly traded on a North American exchange

2. The deal terms (like APHA/TLRY) were either all stock or at least some cash and some stonks

3. Any mergers with an equity value >$500mm USD (some of the smaller ones can get funky)

I then looked at the performance of the acquirer (like TLRY in this case) ‚Äì after the deal closed. I started with the stock price of the acquirer 30 trading days before the merger closed, then looked at 7 days before, one day before, one day after, one week after, one month after, three months after, six months after and finally a year after. Here is what I found‚Ä¶. 

Of the 214 deals that fit this criteria‚Ä¶ \~56% of acquirer stocks were down the day after a merger closed (as measured from the day before), so TLRY is in good company. Of these 56%, the companies were down an AVERAGE of 3% (TLRY currently down \~6%). Then, of those companies that were down on day one, 19% of them were back up after a week, 38% after a month and 48% after 3M. Those 48% that were up after 3M were up an average of 14% from the day before the merger. If TLRY behaved that way, we‚Äôd see TLRY @ $20.90 before long. 

What does this mean for TLRY? It takes some time. This is no guarantee and this definitely isn‚Äôt financial advice, but **today‚Äôs trading likely isn‚Äôt an indicator of future performance.**"

Ideally though, you should probably have a hard, firm rule, to never allocate more than a certain percentage of your account to a single ticker. For example, maybe you have a rule that you're not allowed to have more than 20 percent in any one stock. That'd be 1/5th of your entire account, which is probably not ideal, but it's better than nothing.

There are people that keep buying dips over and over and over again, and the next thing they know, they have 85 percent of their entire account in a stock that's currently experiencing freefall"

Buttt for my strategy I don't like holding positions for too long and CRSR has been sideways for a few months. 

Averaging down + covered calls allows me to lower my cost basis along with increasing my returns in case it runs up. (I believe it will, eventually...)

If you bought walmart 10 years after it went public, you'd still 20x your money (approximately, I didn't really look). The point is that you can wait (if your so inclined) for a company to show you its working before you buy in."
2021-05-03 22:36:33,stocks,"They didn't fail. Netscape's IPO in 1995 valued them at $3 Billion. They were bought out by AOL for $10 Billion in 1999. To be fair, their market cap at the end of '95 was around $9-10 Billion, so they didn't exactly do well over those few years, but if you bought at IPO, you came out ahead. Obviously funds work much differently and they may have caused a drag to some degree. But it's not like they went bankrupt."

2021-05-03 20:17:40,stocks,"Exactly right, unless you're deeply knowledgeable in any emerging tech, you are better off buying the ETF rather than trying to pick winners.  In the above scenario, if you'd have eschewed the ETF and tried to pick winners, you probably would have ended up betting on Netscape, with the result being much worse, all things being equal ;?).

But then a lot of what we do is akin to gambling, and it's hard not to try and pick winners out of the pack, especially when that technology is going to be a world changer, lol.  I did it with Tesla back in 2011, and made some great profits, BUT of course I didn't stick to it, got in and out a couple of times at the wrong point, but overall I'm way ahead.

Of course I'd be a millionaire if I'd just let it ride, lol, woulda, coulda, shoulda ;?D"

Also, I sold all of my long term holds the first of March. I think a long term bear market has started. It's long drawn out top that is hard to recognize. But I might be wrong so I do quick trades so I don't miss out in case it does the opposite of what I think it is doing."
2021-05-04 04:19:00,stocks,I get that. Personally I think we will see a final run up and a correction in Q4 followed by a cyclical shift into commodities and energy related equities after that.
2021-05-03 23:08:24,stocks,In the long term day traders always lose. They may have a good year or two but eventually your luck runs out. You can't compete with the Prop trading companies who have fiber optic cables and custom-made servers connected next to the Wall Street exchange. They're ahead of you in seconds and will close or buy positions before you can even hit enter. Your high speed internet won't matter. You're too far away from the exchange building. In trading the timing matters more than the fundamentals. This is why any decent prop trading companies have offices in NYC. If you want to get into day trading be careful and understand you are competing with companies who have billions to play with and your trading fund is a margin error for them.

If GameStop renovated their brick and mortars to appeal to those groups who live in small towns with NOTHING to do and offer a wider variety of things than just playing video games (like an enclosed ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù shop section like they have in Amsterdam for example) then there‚Äôs a real chance for good returns on their investments"

GME is in the start of a transformation in an industry that is likely in its infancy. The transformation to e-commerce, PC build, and gaming cafe will rejuvenate this company into a monster. Imagine if they open a streaming platform to compete with Twitch? (People literally pay to watch people play) It would be a direct competitor with brick and mortar such as best buy and e-commerce such as amazon. It Gives them a unique opportunity to capture marketshare that nobody has. On top of that it will have the customer service of Chewy. 

For the bears, remember amazon used to be an e-commerce bookstore. 

Extremely bullish on GME fundamentals."

2021-05-04 04:04:14,stocks,"So did they sell new shares or did they not? I heard they raised equity by selling shares.

If the amount of outstanding shares did not change, maybe the company held some of their own shares and sold them? That is also a dilution, as e.g. dividends paid on those shares would have gone back to the company. Essentially, the other shareholders were indirectly holding more shares before the sale than after.

EDIT: Outstanding common stock definitely changed. This is the prospectus for the share emission: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000119312521105564/d160986d424b5.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000119312521105564/d160986d424b5.htm)

 It says that on Apr 1, GME had 70,031,650 shares of common stock outstanding. And after the offering:

>**Common stock to be outstanding immediately after this offering:**  
>  
>Up to 73,531,650 shares (as more fully described in the notes following this table), assuming sales of 3,500,000 shares of our common stock in this offering. The actual number of shares issued will vary depending on the sales price under this offering.  
 

They did sell 3,500,000, so that is the amount of dilution. Outstanding shares reported by e.g. Yahoo seems not to have been fully updated to reflect that."

2021-05-04 08:51:18,stocks,"Yea I have yet to see an actual gamer that's not bullish on the fundimentals long term because they can see the massive trend coming down the pipes.

I'm not even that old, grew up in the ps2/ps3 generation. Played minecraft, skyrim, gta 5, cod4 when they came out close to a decade ago and see they are still just as, if not more popular now. I even remeber the early early days of roblox and it just blows my mind that it IPO'd a few weeks ago. Saw the rise of touch phones and mobile gaming from the early days on an original iPad as well...

Now nearly all my friends and people my age have adult jobs and kids and cheesy as it sounds gaming is the foundation block of the modern family... Seriously though, kids play minecraft in school and it's just a given that every house has a minecraft realm subscription. As a youth football coach I've seen the general participation and student interest fall of a cliff the past few years and gaming is without a doubt the main conversation topic and leasure activity of choice for kids now and it's not even close.

Most young people's first 'adult job present' is a top notch gaming rig and gaming is by far the easiest way to maintain long distance friendships.

Look at the popularity cycle of most games as well, it's basically pump and dump FOMO mania (among us, fortnite) where the crowd makes the memes and the diehards stick around after. Fortnite and shooters have been the craze the past few months but maybe a generational mmorpg or rts is in the works. The industry is always evolving and never stagnate because games dont need to be perfect or simply have the best graphics to be popular.

Sorry for the wall of text lol just get fired up about gaming"

2021-05-04 04:53:14,stocks,"hmmm I just think, after my own DD and others they are positioned extremely well and IMO are valued just fine rn, its a short squeeze so its a bit higher but I genuinely don't believe the 150-170USD price is that far fetched for it but thats just my opinion.


I think the executives they got are very talented at what they do, incredibly succesful people that could have gotten jobs at any fortune 500 company if they wanted. I think, RC leading the way for gamestop alone is incredible, but the actual team he has assembled, the money they got from the 3.5m shares, the debt they payed off has them suitedly in a VERY good and unique position.


Its easy to say why something won't work because of X or Y etc. Its harder to argue that it will work because of A, B C because frankly, for GME, because of their history. Its very easy to say it won't work or won't work that well.


I just think thats a shit take, taking historical data from this stock, which was manipulated for years and had an executive team that was destroying it from the inside out with their absolute shit decisions. 


Seeing this new team, all the extra shit they have gotten during this time (THE BEST would easily be a huge fanbase and the constant marketing + the raised money from the 3.5m shares sold).


Seriously they have been in the news for almost 6 months literally constantly. Most companies would kill for that and they are getting it for free while in the middle of transforming the company.


They got to pay off all the shit debts the previous shit team had gotten themselves into, they have an insane fanbase, their CEO actually did VERY well during the pandemic and managed to close a lot of stores and keep costs down, keeping them afloat. That genuinely was a tremendous task and he did very well for that. 




Look, im not objective, im a shareholder, but these are my opinions. I can't go into a DD discussion rn lol as Im at work but I think not taking all of these things into account and only looking at the negatives is really just not worthwhile."

2021-05-03 21:40:51,stocks,"Actually, they aren't. Here is a link to their investor relations page so you can see where I get my ""opinions"" from. [https://investor.gamestop.com/home](https://investor.gamestop.com/home). (That shows the same day debt payoff and expansion I was talking about too.) Combined with the factual data of them increasing their e-commerce platform with CPU accessories showing that they aren't lying about their statements. I also encourage you to read through their SEC filings over the last 6 months. Everything is factual. [https://sec.report/Ticker/GME](https://sec.report/Ticker/GME)

&#x200B;

Now I'm not saying all ATM offerings are good things at all. Most of them are bad. AMC for example. Now this being my opinion, but based on all factual data shown it seemed that they were doing the 100M offering to raise capital to line the exec's pockets prior to going under. AMC would have to perform 4x better than they were pre-pandemic to stay in business let alone be on the correct side of the P&L scale. (fact). I'm not saying there isn't squeeze potential in AMC but disclosure I am not invested in them because they have shown absolutely no effort to transform their business model into a successful one like current thread discussion GME. Not all ATM offerings are bad, but how do you know which ones are good and which ones are bad? You can A. just assume youll be on the correct side since say 90% are bad (percentage just a guess) or B. Look at the facts from the successful ATM offerings and unsuccessful and compare it to the current situation.

They found that 42% of those stocks finished in the black, while 36% had losses and another 22% vanished altogether. Some of those vanished companies were acquired and generated a decent result for their shareholders, while others were delisted. In any case, the risk of a bad outcome wasn‚Äôt insignificant.
* Similarly,¬†[researchers at JPMorgan](https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-wm-aem/global/pb/en/insights/eye-on-the-market/eotm-the-agony-and-the-ecstasy.pdf)¬†found that between 1980 and 2014, roughly 40% of all stocks in the Russell 3000 Index had suffered a permanent decline of more than 70% from their peak values. The ‚Äúcatastrophic loss‚Äù percentage was even higher in volatile industries like technology and biotechnology.

It will prob find support between 2.80 and 3.05  I would wait until 2.80 to even consider avg down.

What if in 30 years we have 14 or 16 years of public school and universal health care."
2021-05-03 21:05:34,stocks,"You might be earning less but still paying more.

You also have to consider which way our society is shifting. Is there going to be 14 years of public school, more government health care, UBI?

You might be in a lower tax bracket after you retire, but taxes may be higher because of more government spending."
2021-05-04 01:37:27,stocks,"There is no way to know and its not as if the above two factors would increase taxes either. If kids are in school more, that means parents get to be more productive and will likely make more money thus more tax revenue. Same can be argued with health care. It might actually bring costs down which is not hard to believe given how out of reality costs have become. But who knows?

What if they lower the tax on low earners further and just increase it on high earners like back in the FDR era? What if there is another major recession and they let you withdraw it at a discount or even tax free?

Further, regular income is extremely easy to write off and just gets easier as you age. But again, you never know where politics will go. A roth is more predictable but comes at a cost. For most that cost is $1k to $2k of the initial basis."
2021-05-04 02:18:02,stocks,"You're confused about the additional schooling. Some people want associates degrees to be free. That's schooling for adults, not children.

If everyone has healthcare you assume everyone will be healthier. That's a big IF. You do not consider how inefficient government is at anything and how many more people will be on healthcare.

There's only 1 think you need to predict, is the US debt going to rise faster than the stock market?

Everyone will be paying taxes, will more of the burden be on the rich or the poor? Who knows, but everyone will pay and the cost has only been going up."
2021-05-04 09:30:01,stocks,"Thats a valid perspective. Its certainly the conservative one. But there are others. I know Biden wants to make pre-school free. Thats actually a damn good idea since many modern families need 2 jobs to get ahead.

Associate degrees being free means population intellect generally rises. There are a lot of good programs in those that you cant find in bachelor level universities, especially practical stuff. At least thats how it is here in CA. I am on the fence about it honestly. I wish they would filter money to specific degrees rather than just make it a blanket funding for any degree but thats wishful thinking. Even conservatives havent touched this topic.

I am not sold the free market is better than government at everything. I think there are plenty of exceptions to the rule. Problem with health care is insurance runs up prices without a care about cost because they know they can pass it on to us. This is problematic and creates a cycle of rising cost. The system is not good and there are plenty of countries with good socialized medicine.

At this point I am for trying anything else in terms of healthcare. Literally anything. Ill even take making insurance illegal over what we have. I think many younger folks will agree. My insurance bill is $900/mo right now for me, wife and 3 kids... Though I can afford it, its gotten out of hand and brings us back to why young couples need 2 jobs..."

In the case of Apple and Caterpillar yes they beat analyst expectations. But investors in the broad market had much higher expectations of Apple and CAT than these analysts. In general analysts are usually less bullish than the market-at-large. 

So even though CAT may have beaten analyst expectations, most investors were expecting 3.2 EPS or even more."

Yeah they may make more on unemployment but unemployment doesn‚Äôt last forever nor is it considered guaranteed income, let alone income at all. If you want to finance a house or car, you can‚Äôt being on unemployment. You see your dream house or a car you so badly want but you can‚Äôt get it. Eventually after all is said and done, what if they can‚Äôt get their job back? There‚Äôs a huge gap in employment there. Employers will wonder why and will ask questions.
