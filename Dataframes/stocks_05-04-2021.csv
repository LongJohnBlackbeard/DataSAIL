2021-05-04 19:44:08,stocks,Just about everything has been going down on even good earnings. Your 9/17 calls should be a good call. Especially due to PYPL getting into the crypto game = bump in earnings

We chose not to use it because it was very similar to features integrated into our current EMR.

2021-05-04 19:57:39,stocks,"*Ceteris paribus*, raising interest rates decreases the effective money supply, which lowers inflation across the board, on average.

2021-05-04 19:03:40,stocks,"You just need to understand what TA actually tells you. TA will never tell you what a stock will do, but it does narrow the probabilities.

Of course this also depends on \*what\* TA you're doing... certainly there is some completely useless astrological stuff. But stuff like support, resistance, trend lines and triangles are surprisingly useful."
2021-05-04 19:10:23,stocks,"Professional poker players also “gamble” yet can consistently make money. Just like a poker player, a good/professional trader (not me) using TA understands the probability of their position turning profitable, sizes their “bet” appropriately, and knows to cut their losses if the market moves against them. Even in a situation where it’s 50/50, if the upside is 10% and you cut losses to 5%, you can make money. 

The problem is most people (like me) aren’t good at TA, just like they aren’t good enough to make money at poker. People from the outside can’t see who is good (not me) or who is lucky (not me either) because we don’t know everyone’s trade history."
2021-05-04 18:56:26,stocks,Understanding chart patterns and market psychology is important- but it is NOT a wide brush to sweep across any ticker. Marry a single stock. Two if you’re gutsy. Make sure they have good volume and move. Also chart the indices/major etf holdings. Study. Make money. I do none of these things cause I’m not a nerd and am a lieutenant in the moon platoon; but I know of several very successful day traders that stock to 3-5 stocks and make a killing
2021-05-04 19:11:57,stocks,"it's actually automated, the trick is to spot it before the herd comes and buys it on momentum and trend, stops in place because TA tells you where the stock will go lower at X price.

2021-05-04 19:03:04,stocks,Added some references for you. Probability and statistics is against your hypothesis.
2021-05-04 19:05:36,stocks,I have MD and currently in phd focused on probability...
2021-05-04 19:26:25,stocks,">Probability and statistics is against your hypothesis.

I don't think you understand probability and statistics. There are only two binary outcomes - win or lose.

The simplest way to look at it is if you have a method that gets you a greater than 50% win rate, then your method is more accurate than ""all of them pick stocks randomly"" because a random pick with normal distribution of binary outcomes will give you a maximum 50% win rate.

If I have a coin that has even a 51% chance of coming up heads, then I'm guaranteed to win if if I flip it 100,000 times and bet the same amount each time.

For some traders at some points in time, TA is that 51%+ coin."

2021-05-04 18:46:32,stocks,"If you’re trading short term, these will net out as short term capital gains less short term capital loss = zero. There are also long term capital gains and losses for longer holds (and futures contracts) and you generally can’t use short term losses to offset tax due on realized long term gains (and vice versa). You also can’t use capital losses to offset ordinary income from your job (except to the extent of $3k per year). 

Hope this is useful but please consult a professional tax advisor with specific questions about your situation."
2021-05-04 18:58:43,stocks,"Yep, you add the sum of your gains and loss short term and long term are calculated separately"

2021-05-04 18:57:36,stocks,I ended up buying at 180 and then 200.  Valuation is expensive.  Earnings is on may 18 so maybe wait for a pullback.  It is a long term holding of mine.

I myself have rotated out of some of my tech heavy portfolio and into industrials and commodities with dividend payouts.

Let's look at CLF, America's largest steel maker. 

They are cleaning up steel making, and build a giant HBI plant to replace coal with natural gas. This dramatically reduces the greenhouse gas, and more importantly the fine particulate emissions from coal.

We are ALWAYS going to need steel (if you want to live like this), so it is better to invest in companies that are taking action on FEEL GOOD idea about the world, even if it is ""dirty money""."

2021-05-04 17:58:07,stocks,Precious metals are more for storing wealth then making big gains. Kinda like a off grid savings account. It’s also fun to hold unlike all the 0s and 1s on a screen.
2021-05-04 18:45:29,stocks,When ever you see commercials for gold or silver its usually because the prices are suddenly up and they can make alot of money off of you. Its the wrong time to buy. Ive bought physical gold bullion for 24 years and made lots of money. Ive bought it when it was 400.00 875.00 1250.00 and 1450.00. an once but i wont buy now unless it goes down to 1600.00. Having physical gold gives you security that nothing else can.
2021-05-04 19:47:05,stocks," Precious metals have a history of staying put for a long time and then spiking up for a short period of time.   You can see the historical silver chart at [https://goldprice.org/spot-gold.html](https://goldprice.org/spot-gold.html) (Please change the chart to silver) and you can see what I am saying.   If you can catch the upside, it will be tremendous.

Inflation will hit at some point but we are also seeing return to work across the board internationally so we are also going to start seeing more spending and production. Maybe I'm wrong but it seems like if the market was going to crash that it would have already. Personally, I don't trust the ""Institutional experts"" as they for one have a lot to gain monetarily by manipulating the views of the masses and second are the people who 'knew what they were doing' before the '08 crash."

CORN, WOOD, CUT, GSG, there's a ton of exploding ETFs with exposure to commodities."
2021-05-04 18:35:53,stocks,"Aren't increases predominantly tied to high demand for construction and low production due to reduced workforce availability with distancing in manufacturing plants creating a scarcity of materials as people are trying to invest?

Everywhere I look we have places starved for workers and trying to hire more, specifically for production work meaning there is an active demand that cannot be met. If we look at easily identifiable shortages, say ammunition, we don't see inability in the market to produce but rather such extreme demand that the imposed limitations on manufacturers to produce as they had been is prolonging the shortages. This is resulting in holding with a mentality being, ""Well if it's available I may as well buy it all."" We just saw this with toilet paper a few months ago. To me this doesn't signal an economic collapse being imminent as there is excessive demand and production is trying to keep up. As soon as requirements to space at manufacturing facilities returns to normal I would expect prices to return to what they were as as there isn't an actual market shift thats causing scarcity, rather just artifical requirements."

2021-05-04 17:40:09,stocks,"## Price Estimates

**2021**

This year looks pretty damn strong!  With the [price of REOs still being sky fucking high](https://www.kitco.com/strategic-metals/) for both Neodymium and Praseodium (which is what makes up the majority of MP’s revenue as stated in their 10K) the Q1 and Q2 results should be goddamn stellar.  There is an **average** of 50% higher price for both key elements in Q1, and looking to be similar for Q2.  This alone puts the EPS at $0.27 per quarter and assuming the price goes back to a more normal (but still higher than 2020) level, the EPS for 2021 is around $1 - so based on the forward P/E model, this puts a conservative price **right now** of $42 / share!  


**2022**

2022 continues steady growth, but then explodes Stage II is complete!  I’m assuming it is complete after Q2, and that’s when the cost to produce drops the way down and production goes way up.   Suddenly the profit margin rockets up to 80% and the year end EPS is $1.47, putting the forward looking price at $61 / share!

**2023**

Now things are ramping the fuck up with a full year in that Stage II production heaven.  Efficient as all hell, clean as a whistle, and profitable as a goose laying golden eggs.  Profit margins of up over 80% for the full year, pushing the EPS up to $2.02 for a forward looking price of **$85 per share**!  

**2024**

Full steam ahead as now they are **completely independent** and calling all the shots.  Metal coming out of wazoo, minimal shipping costs, maximum **PROFIT**.  This place is fucking cooking now, full goddamn power.  Now the EPS jumps up to **$3.60** and that gives…. **$151 share price! That’d be 5x what it is now, and is looking like an amazing long term hold


So this is why I keep getting more excited.  $30 / share right now is peanuts - and it is likely to hit a sharp spike after earnings forces many of the short sellers to revise their thesis.  

Now, there is the threat of China, but [considering China owns an 8% stake in the company, they are more likely hedging their bets rather than looking to kill it.](https://fintel.io/so/us/mp).  Hell, Shenghe has even helped them get started - I don’t see China looking to kill them anytime soon."

Hypothetically: the Gates could have a ton of assets in a trust that is set to pass to their heirs(3 children) when they pass away. It could also possible that they had written in there that a divorce also triggers this inheritance event. If so, divorcing could allow this capital to be passed on before Biden gets rid of the tax loophole. Need a lawyers opinion on if the divorce could qualify for the step-up rule exemption but they have access to the best lawyers in the world to word that in there correctly."

2021-05-04 18:30:00,stocks,"I'm actually in the exact same boat as you. I jumped feet-first into investing in February after watching the GME craze make a few of my friends very wealthy in a short period of time. I decided not to touch it with a ten-foot pole, however, as I was right when thinking I was very much late to the party.

Keep in mind that stocks like GME are a total anomaly. The stock market in general is not a ""get rich quick"" scheme, and just because a stock you own isn't parabolic on a daily basis like GME was does not make it a poor investment.

When I started investing in February, I allotted 50% of my portfolio to ETFs to ""capture"" the momentum of the bull market without picking too many individual stocks and being wrong on some or all of them. The other 50% went to companies I really liked and had intimate familiarity with. As an example, I'm really, really bullish on CHWY as both a lifelong pet owner and customer. I bought shares at the top in February ($111 was my entry point iirc). As you can see, it's been hammered down ever since into a consolidation zone between $76-$83. Their incredible Q1 earnings strengthened my conviction even more, so I've been averaging down on this one, all the way down to $89. You could pull up virtually any growth stock and see that CHWY is not the problem - the entire sector has been way down since February ATHs. So while I'm still very much in the red on this one, I'm very confident in its future and have no reason to cut bait since it's a long term hold for me. Do you own any companies in your portfolio that you feel this way about? I find this mindset really helps in ""riding the wave.""

Lastly, what REALLY helps (and has been mentioned on this sub many times) is to ""zoom out"" when hit with market pullback days. Pull up the 1-year chart or even 5-year chart to see how the stock has performed over time. You'll find that the red and green individual days don't matter a hell of a lot over time if the company is sound and sought-after. Just over a year ago, $TSLA went from $500 down to $330 in just a week. Now that we have the gift of hindsight, we'd put our entire portfolios into that dip, would we not? There were undoubtedly plenty of posts like this on that very week with many an overreaction and bearish sentiment. The moral of the story is, don't lose sight of the big picture. It helps keep your (very normal) emotions in check, which tend to be your worst enemy in the always unpredictable market. Good luck out there!"
2021-05-04 16:46:36,stocks,"Your problem isn’t that “time in the market beats timing the market” doesn’t work. It’s that you ain’t in the market, you haven’t given it time, and you tried to time a market.

The market usually refers to the S&P500, or an all world index fund or set of funds. Both of which is up since February.

Chances are you made a bet on a specific sector or money manager (clean energy or arkk maybe? Both are way down from their peaks).

Finally you need to give it time. A few months is nothing from an investment perspective. You need a few decades before things get interesting."
2021-05-04 16:37:39,stocks,"Look back at previous crashes and dips. Every one of them had an all time high before it, and a significantly higher all time high after recovery.

2. Best time to be down in value is when you are just starting out.  A 20% drop of $5,000 ($1,000) is much better than a 20% drop of $1,000,000 ($200,000) down the road.  I've had that happen, but it didn't change my investing strategy. 
3. Not sure what you are investing for.  If it's retirement, no issue, just let time be your friend.  If it's not retirement, assess whether stocks are the best place (based on risk) to invest your money.
4. Generate a plan for investing.  Why are you doing it in the first place?  What is your risk tolerance?  The Bogleheads recommend having an Investment Policy Statement (ISP) that defines goals and objectives.  Here's a link: [Investment Policy Statement](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement).

We ALL make mistakes.  The issue is whether we learn from those mistakes.  They can be very valuable experiences.  I think it's great that you have started investing, and wish you nothing but great success!

I DON'T WANT TO GET POLITICAL but the reality is that sometimes public policy affects private interests strongly. This is one of those cases.

While Biden has not publicly acknowledged a desire to end for-profit prisons that I am aware of, it has been a pipe-dream of the left for some time now.

Many believe Biden will use for-profit prisons to keep the far-left happy the first time he needs to compromise with the GOP (Ex. works with GOP on taxes when the left ERUPTS he will executive order private prisons done by 2030 or some far-out date for political pacification).

Note, I am not trying to throw my opinion for/against any of these policies. I am just trying to bring some critical information on market sentiment to the post.

I will not respond to any political discussion but I will respond if there is a pertinent comment or question.

TL;DR:

Hedges are betting Biden outlaws for-profit prisons via executive action.

It’s not a fantasy. It’s reality. The us cannot operate without these locations, granted they may do a split, build some buy some, but it will still profit share holders substantially.

Most analyst/advisors have this as a $8-$15 stock, it’s currently way undervalued.

Morals and preference aside, the fact is they hold a large amount of real estate and top of the line facilities. Regardless of what Biden attempts to do, they will have many other options to maintain the current low share value."

Well for every one of those guys, there were 10 people saying in 2003/04/05/06 that there was a bubble and a crash was due in a few weeks/months. Similarly people have been saying since 2015 that this bull market is going to come to a crashing end.

Not saying that those guys were idiots by any means, in fact a lot of them were very smart (and had solid economic data to back up their theory) - the problem is the market is as much investor psychology as it is economics. It’s like a game of musical chairs - the bull market will continue until it doesn’t.

I guess the closest thing to “everyday people” predicting the crash were the 2 young guys (Charlie and Jamie) from the Big Short, and also another guy Andrew Lahde from 2008. But again, for every one of them there were 10 guys who either missed out on huge returns by saying back in 2004 the bull market was over, or worse shorted the market and got wiped out.

My personal strategy is to stay invested, but always keep enough cash to buy the dips - 2008-9 and especially 2020 were amazing buying opportunities."

In that case he a) started shorting too early, and b) shorted the crappiest debt tranches but actually bought the highest/best tranches as he was expecting a moderate but not catastrophic drop.

So yeah poor execution/poor timing is basically the same as being wrong - so not only do you have to be right about your idea of a market collapse, but you have to a) be right about timing and b) trade on it correctly. So not easy by any means"
2021-05-04 17:43:28,stocks,"Yeah I mean the dotcom market was very similar to the run up to 2008 tbh. I was too young to be investing back then but from reading up about it, at the time it seemed obvious that a lot of these dotcoms were nothing but hot air - and even the companies who were genuinely revolutionary (Netscape and AOL for example) were still grossly valued. The problem as ever is timing.

Stanley Druckenmiller (George Soros’ top protege) got burned badly on shorting dotcom stocks - he saw the signs of these dotcoms being all hype and worthless, problem was he saw it too early (which is the same as being wrong).
He took massive losses shorting the stocks in 1997 and 1998, and got wiped out before the bubble burst I think - and he wasn’t alone by any means, there were lots of other hedge fund managers at the time in similar situations.

Plus even hedge fund/asset managers who weren’t shorting dotcom stocks but just avoiding them still suffered badly - investors heard them dismiss internet stocks in 1997 and then saw everyone else in the market making fortunes in 98 and 99, and jumped ship as they were missing out on those returns.

And yeah there wasn’t any sudden catalyst that really caused the bubble to burst in 2000 - rather the market had a few down days, and then it just accelerated from there. Investor psychology magnifies bubbles but it also magnifies the collapse - as investors panic and sell, pushing down prices and causing other investors to sell. So yeah psychology as much as anything"

2021-05-04 19:29:46,stocks,"Well I guess it depends on what your investing strategy is - if you’re buying indexes or solid companies for the long-term, personally I would keep a chunk of cash on the side so you can jump in every time there is a dip/mini-crash.

Also the illogical psychology of markets can be a great opportunity too. I mean look at last March - obviously without Powell we wouldn’t have had such a rapid recovery, but equally the decline in the stockmarket was suggesting this was the end of the world.

So unless you thought last March that this was the final global apocalypse, whilst everyone was running around panicking you could be buying. Maybe the recovery would’ve taken 1yr, maybe it would’ve taken 2-4 years - but either way as an investor you would’ve eventually been richly rewarded with 50-75% gains.

I’m probably oversimplifying, but the same psychology/herd mentality of investors in the market that make timing so difficult, also means there will be times when you realize it’s very likely (obviously not certain) that the market is panic overreacting and that if you buy cheap and hold medium/long term you’ll do very well."
2021-05-04 19:52:30,stocks,"Personally now I have a Boglehead 3-4 fund portfolio I’m building out with pretty rigid percentages.

I know we say don’t time, but on those long term holds I LOVE seeing red days because I feel anywhere from 2-10 years out they’ll pay out big. I’ve pretty much come to terms where I’m putting my “gambling” money and don’t think I’ll really be swapping any stocks out. 

So yeah, anyone that mistook this as a “red day panic post”, nope. It gets me a little sometimes, admittedly, but no I’d love a good correction/crash because I have plenty to keep adding to over the years. 

Hopefully the more I refine my strategy the less mass investor mentality will get me."

There are plenty of other industries that have growth companies.

Consumer staples companies are those that produce commodity consumer items.  Whether or not their overall markets are growing or shrinking the companies pursue ways to make the market stable for their goods.  Usually people think of these things as things that people will buy regardless of the state of their checkbook, unlike ""consumer discretionary"" which are things are more likely to be bought when the checkbook is full.

The only exception to that is when they change the margin requirements on a specific security due to volatility (which could be as much as 1:1). In which case they may liquidate that specific security up to 50% (i.e. 0% margin).

2021-05-04 18:40:31,stocks,"Hrm. It's an interesting idea.

I didn't listen to the podcast, but I did check out [their holdings](https://horizonkinetics.com/products/etf/infl/#holdings) and if one is looking for a ""thinking persons"" inflation hedge ETF then this is probably the one. 

So with notable exceptions (land trusts/medical/stock exchanges) this ETF is heavy into companies that deal in percentages as income. Interestingly there is no O&G from what I can see where these things are much more common. I think they have pressure not to invest in the sector, because there are lots of options there, particularly in Canada which this fund seems to like.

Anyways, three of the largest holdings are streaming companies I know very well (and the fund is overweight Canada which is very rare), so I'll talk about them to give a bigger picture of what it seems the fund wants to achieve/invest-to-hedge.

Now, the three royalty companies here that I know well are WPM, OR, and FNV. Combined they make up ~11% of the fund. Although the companies aren't identical, they work in similar ways. They invest in promising mines (primarily, but they do have other interests) with the guarantee of a percentage of the mines profits for a set period of time, in a particular way. Like 10% of the gold, in gold and silver, for 5 years for $5 million up front. That's about it. It's a simple business to understand and a hard one to be successful in.  

But if inflation goes up their profits are unaffected, as, the theory goes, they don't run mines, they just cash the cheques/stack the bars, and if there's inflation, commodities will rise with it and so will their profits. The double bonus, again in theory, is that as these companies are primarily in the precious metals scene they will win extra as people ""flee to safety"" in gold. 

Other holdings are heavily weighted towards shit like land trusts (inflation means land gets more valuable right along side); the high-quality stock exchanges of Canada, Singapore, and Australia (inflation means the physical exchanges are worth more, they don't devalue, and may well benefit with the devaluation of USD as  resource and trading economies respectively); etc. 

So yeah, in closing the whole thing is made up of shit that won't get clobbered, and will in fact disproportionately benefit, if the dollar loses like 30% of its value. I don't see hyperinflation on the horizon in anything other than houses and equities however, and so in that case this may underperform the S&P. Saying that, I also think it's probably prudent to invest in these sorts of things (I own some of these holdings, for instance) but I think you could build a ""poor man's"" etf of very similar companies without much trouble."

Admittedly GE has a ton of legacy issues for any current CEO to grapple with - but a big part of the problem is the last few CEOs (going back to Immelt) seem to have just come in and enjoyed all the corporate perks/lavish pay, without doing much/anything for shareholders.

It’s kind of like an anti-Bezos/Musk as CEO - ie instead of building the business long-term, management seems to be focused on short-term efforts and maximising their own compensation.

They did this to build their cash on hand to account for the losses associated with the GE Energy division. At some point there was talks to spin-off their aviation or healthcare divisions to their own IPO because these two were the most successful parts of the company that were getting dragged down by the negative divisions. Oh, and they also sold their GE Lighting division because their products sucked. IMO they’re a bloated company that isn’t innovating and is bleeding the only valuable portions dry.

This is more to do with COVID than anything else. Building material and chip supply chain disruptions have caused prices to spike, and building basically stopped early last year which killed momentum. Reopening will cause the spike to continue, then as supply catches up, prices will revert. They may end up slightly higher and there will be short term issues, but it will be this time next year before the supply chains are shaken out."

Lumber is expensive because 2020's harvest was much lower than usual because of COVID and because transport is a shitshow. 

Chips are short because raw materials mining stopped for a while last year, and transport is a shitshow. 

Food is more expensive because migrant farm workers couldn't travel so the harvest was both lower and more expensive, and also transport is a shitshow.

Housing is short because construction literally stopped, and because raw materials are more expensive, and because transport is a shitshow.

The list goes on. They will be writing analysis of the knock on effects of 2020 for the next 50 years. It's caused a huge shift away from cash worldwide, accelerating an existing trend. It's caused a huge shift to eCommerce globally, accelerating another existing trend. It's caused an interruption in the supply of source materials for critical industries and exposed just how fragile the logistics chains supplying entire nations have become. Knock on effects will include partial re-industrialization of the most advanced nations who just had it graphically demonstrated that there are strategic vulnerabilities in their economies. The next few years will be very interesting."

2021-05-04 17:18:01,stocks,"I disagree there too. Most building materials are not imported. Simply production had been ramped down due to sluggish demand post 2008. Then as production rapidly increased during the pandemic in regards to building/housing jobs (as those were still at full production, housing is considered essential) - they realized that people were actually saving money by working from home (gas, eating out, no bar bills, less entertainment) demand for homes spiked really really really rapidly in early 2021 and late 2020."

But an expanding wealth gap combined with lots of monetary expansion could have some interesting long term effects.

2021-05-04 12:06:57,stocks,"ETFs are high conviction, long term plays. Only buy them when you plan to hold through the ups & downs. That’s just my advice, not a rule. 

Green energy stocks were boosted by Biden election, and have been falling off to a fairer current value ever since. I see them as growth opportunities that will come to fruition 5-10 years from now, potentially beating the market on average over that time.

In the short term, they’ll probably continue to suffer a bit. If you’re really into the sector, I’d use this opportunity to average down your cost. 

If not, it’s up to you if you want to put the money somewhere else. But a lot of investors suffer a lot of losses by bouncing from asset to asset chasing short term gains instead of just waiting."
2021-05-04 12:41:01,stocks,If this was the ICLN from a couple weeks ago I would recommend you sell. Now they rebalanced and added better strong fundamental green energy companies and they cut the highly speculative green energy companies down. Before they were really involved in highly speculative energy companies. I still will never recommend anybody to buy this ETF but it seems they are moving in the right direction so I would recommend to hold.

If all it takes is a demand for an asset to appreciate (eg, cryptos, gold, tulips, and quite consistently at that), what is stopping all equity that does not pay dividends like Amazon or Tesla or AMD to be worth 1$ per share? If all the money in the world says crypto is the best, whats stopping most equity to be worth nothing basically regardless of how well the actual business is?"
2021-05-04 11:50:31,stocks,">what is stopping all equity that does not pay dividends like Amazon or Tesla or AMD to be worth 1$ per share?

2021-05-04 12:26:22,stocks,"Crypto isn't worth anything besides the implied and subjective demand for it, but the same can't be said for securities. Dividends are one form of profit distribution, but even without that, it's still a real and tangible company with real and tangible assets. Businesses are worth something, and as a shareholder you are a part owner of that. Perhaps you only have a very small fraction of ownership, but you still own a part of the underlying business. It's not a subjective or abstract thing. A company with assets has value, so your share of that business has value.

If AMZN was worth $1/share, at 500M shares outstanding, what's stopping someone from spending half a billion to assume majority ownership of an almost $2T company?"
2021-05-04 12:29:19,stocks,"Crypto is a vehicle for speculation. A dedicated pump and dump resource with no intrinsic value.

Stocks are ownership of a company. You literally own part of the company and if you buy enough you can quite literally own the whole company or enough to effectively control it. The company itself has assets and generates profit, so ownership of the company has real intrinsic value."
2021-05-04 12:09:48,stocks,"Big businesses all have some kind of intrinsic value. As an easy example, Apple has $200 bil cash on hand and 0 debt. Meaning they can’t ever really be worth less than that for no reason. If the market cap fell below $200 bil tomorrow then they could just buy out all the shares themselves. 

You’ve got a reasonably good point, but that’s just how the stock market works. It isn’t rational because most investors arent rational. This is why index funds often outperform stock pickers. As the world grows there will always be increasing inflows of money to the stock market. But you’ll rarely be able to guess which companies or sectors it goes to.

Though unlikely, there’s nothing stopping doge from becoming more valuable than gold and then wreaking havoc on the sell off similar to how tulips did. But to keep it in perspective.. all cryptocurrencies combined have a smaller market cap than Apple does. To reiterate: every single cryptocurrency on earth combined is worth less than 1 company. So you can be bitter seeing dogecoin rise day after day, but keep in mind it’s a relatively small number of people doing this with a relatively small amount of money."
2021-05-04 11:53:49,stocks,"You are aware that ONE stock... yes ONE stock in the entire stock market... take Apple for example.... has double the value/market cap of Bitcoin right..... I think you are over estimating the ""rise"" of Bitcoin. Its still a drop in the ocean compare to the US stock market...... you are literally talking about a crypto currency that ONE STOCK in the market Apple has double its value.......... let that sink in.... now imagine if u added every other SP500 stocks to that market cap it would be 100x bitcoins market cap..... so all the money in the world DEFINITELY does not say BTC is the best.... if it did the market cap of bitcoin would exceed 5,10 trillion cause that is how much buying power is in the stock market way more than that actually"

2021-05-04 15:22:47,stocks,"Because if you own 100% of the shares of a company, you own the actual company, which has assets, real estate, desks, chairs, sales, profits, and intellectual property.

Wonder if that is a good play now.  CARR is popping up too. I'll check out JCI. Any additional thoughts?"
2021-05-04 16:56:00,stocks,Can you explain the Carrier hate?
2021-05-04 13:37:24,stocks,"Changes are minor. Nothing to make the companies make a big move. Companies like Trane and JCI are huge. Not going anywhere but not enough movement to make a huge difference in their revenue. 

   Filters are made by a bunch of manufacturers. If you wanted to target any of them, you want a company that makes HEPA filters. Lucky is right on the UV lights. If places dont have them they may add to their existing systems. 

Other than that, the biggest changes we have seen is use of cleaning products, but that's dropping off since the CDC says you don't have to nuke everything anymore.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen raising the possibility on Tuesday she is neither predicting nor recommending that the Federal Reserve raise interest rates as a result of President Biden’s spending plans, walking back her comments earlier in the day that rates might need to rise to keep the economy from overheating. The markets reacted negatively to the news the interests could rise meaning investing in equities becomes less attractive."

That’s why there’s circuit breakers now to allow retail traders to react and the market to catch up. Also helps to try and reset the computer algos.

Edit: It was done by one guy spoofing the market and is detailed in the book flash crash. He went to jail however all the big banks do this. Jpm just had to pay a massive fine for this in the silver market. None of them went to jail. This guy beat the market/trading bots and he should have been rewarded.

Powell just said they aren't even thinking about thinking about changing rates yet."
2021-05-04 12:45:51,stocks,And the market started selling off well before that. Seems pretty coincidental. I’m sure this info wasn’t leaked to the hedgies and other big money beforehand cause that would mean the system was rigged.

2021-05-04 15:15:18,stocks,"It's not irrelevant. If prices are the highest in history and historically we have seen periods of lost wealth, where it would take 10+ years to recoup your initial investment, it's not irrelevant. Some people don't want to wait 20 years for their investment to average out in the green.
Timing the lowest low of the market is unreasonable, but you can still have some semblance of when the market is over or undervalued.
If you have a lump sum you want to invest, DCA invest some with a portion ready to buy in when you think the market looks better."

Go and look at a historical list of yearly gains and losses of SPX. You're not going to see many 8%s. Almost none, actually.

You're going to see lots of years with rather huge jumps and also plenty of years deep in the red.

Never count on a reversion to the mean unless your outlook is decades, and even then, maybe not."
2021-05-04 15:13:42,stocks,"Not sure on your sources of information and that is a pretty cherry picked window. 

SPY (the ETF) has been just shy of 10% (9.96%) since it was created. S&P 500 has averaged 10% since the 1920's. Also you are completely skipping the fact that the market tanked in Feb/March 2020. From Feb 14, 2020 (day before first drop) to today, the market is up 22.6%, for those 445 days (call that 18% annual return). Is that maybe a bit overheated? maybe, but nothing crazy.

For example summers have historical been flat for the markets. All we need is a flat summer and we are at the standard normal 10% return."

As to why CAGR > AAGR... Consider 2 years of a stock, one year up 50% one down 50%. In reality you've landed at 75% of your initial investment. AAGR says the average rate is 0%. CAGR correctly gives you the real rate of return which is about -13.5%.

Fund managers and financial advisors often use AAGR over CAGR because it is always higher so it looks better to the customer. It doesn't reflect the real rate of return unless all periods are the exact same growth."

2021-05-04 12:15:59,stocks,"Value has historically outperformed growth by an [average of 4.54% per year](https://www.dimensional.com/us-en/insights/when-its-value-versus-growth-history-is-on-values-side#:~:text=Growth%20Stock%3A%20A%20stock%20trading,high%20relative%20prices%20(growth)), though the premium is thought to be lower now that factor theory has been popularized.  Value tends to underperform for long periods of more than a decade, but then have short bursts where it makes up all of that ground and then some.  So people will always say ""this time is different, value is dead"", and it's never dead.

Value is also actually higher risk than growth, as evidenced by these long periods of underperformance.  They must be riskier because you can't easily attain higher returns without taking on more risk in a (mostly) efficient market.  Growth stocks tend to have higher beta (volatility), so they look riskier on a short-term basis, but market beta only explains something like 2/3 of stock returns.  There are other systemic risk factors, of which value is one (look up Fama French if you want to learn more about risk factors and how they explain stock returns better than volatility alone).

It's a bit counterintuitive that ""cheap"" stocks should be riskier, but the explanation is that cheap companies tend to have less stable / more cyclical earnings, and higher debt, so investors demand higher returns to invest in them.  Growth stocks intuitively would seem riskier because of the speculative nature, but since most of their valuation is based on earnings far into the future, short term shocks have a small effect.  We saw exactly why value stocks are riskier than growth stocks play out with Covid."

I'm barely making over minimum wage but I invest not trade since I trust facts which says investing beats gambling. I've lived a frugal life and only had shitty rentals for 12 years saving up my 20% down on a condo. My parents gave me $0.

2021-05-04 19:34:15,stocks,"If you can double or triple your money instead of 10x or 100x and pay ten years that's what most people will take. Better yet get education or skills or work hard or some combination or all of them. What you need is a high income job or two jobs to afford a higher mortgage and no amount of ""gambling"" gives you that. The mortgage lets you leverage 5x safely. If you can take 5 years longer and instead of 50/50 chance of losing it all it goes to 0% chance of losing it and you still double most people should do that. Even Amazon or Microsoft or Google or Apple would be better than ""gambling"". There's different kinds of gambling.

If you're specifically looking at the stock market as a whole throughout the last 2 years, okay, yeah, sure.

We pissed away 10s of thousands of dollars in rent for half a decade... we DIDNT have the choice to make smart investments. I fucking gambled and got super lucky it finally after years paid off, even though everyone gave me the advice you just did. I ignored it and I Encourage EVERYONE who's young to try. The whole system if you play by it is meant to keep you broke and dependent, and then eventually more ppl will fall into govt programs/control bc they see no other way out

Everyone younger (sub 35/maybe even 40 depends on family situation) should either start your own biz, gamble on high risk investments, or join a small biz where you can grow and go to the moon with them. Bc if you fail, well you were poor anyways, no difference, but at least you stand a mf'n chance to get out of that shithole life without wasting 30 years of it just to get above water and move to a neighborhood where you dont gotta worry about walking the block at night

Its 2021, anyone who gives effort (idc what news says, most ppl try, and some get so defeated they do give up) should never ever have to worry about a meal or safety in the most powerful nation in human history. Its a fkn joke. And we should be helping the entire world, and working towards a better future for our entire species.

2021-05-04 15:22:00,stocks,"News came out yesterday that plans to ship out doses to the EU have been delayed until Q3. With most arriving in 2022. This is bad news for a couple reasons.

Because of the inevitable spread of variants, with each day that passes the original vaccine becomes less and less effective. Right now Novavax is best in class against the original virus, and pretty effective against the UK variant. Other variants, not so much. By the time the vaccine can be delivered it might already be too late to help most people and we'll be needing booster shots to supplement it. We have no idea how long it will take to make and distribute these booster shots. We've already seen Novavax struggle getting across the finish line with what should be a slam dunk, and this is just presents another stumbling block for them.

Even if the variants are not a problem there's the issue of market share. The mRNA vaccines have basically won the race at this point and everyone else is fighting for the bronze. People only need to be vaccinated once, so being late to the party is crippling for any company trying to get into the Covid space. Right now most of the world is just getting started putting needles into arms, but we've seen in America how fast things can progress once vaccine drives really ramp up. How many people will still be unvaccinated after 3-4 months? The money pile is quickly drying up."

If there is a ton of data, I am sure each one of us can come up with some kind of analysis and draw out some kind of conclusions. But does it matter? No. Market is unpredictable.

When retail buys stock they do based on the stock and company in it self. Only high energy people consider inflation bond yields and other 5head shit when buying individual stocks. you know what seems more bullish right now since it doesn't need to put up with the manipulation stocks are going through. 

I think more people will sell manipulated stocks in order to buy you know what. That and panic sellers and just generally tired people who would rather have their money in places where it wont get affected by 5head shit like bond yields interest inflation and whatever."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"DD: $ASO - Lawyers, Guns, and Money If you have not heard the song *Lawyers, Guns, and Money* by Warren Zevon then you're not missing much, but it does loosely tie into my analysis of **Academy Sports + Outdoors**.

**Intro:** There's a chance you haven't heard of Academy Sports if you're not from the Southern United States- and that's ok. The business is simple, Academy Sports operates as a sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer, similarly to Dick's Sporting Goods, Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's, and Sportsman's Warehouse. In terms of business model, there's not much more to it than that, except for 1 key difference compared to Dick's and some other competitors; **Academy Sports sells guns and ammunition**. I'll be using some comparisons to these company's in the analysis below. 

**Notes:**

1. The reason I'm putting this write-up together today is because of recent action on behalf of the major shareholders. I will go more into detail on that below.
2. ASO was intially publicly offered at the beginning of October 2020. I typically stay away from IPOs in general, but took a look at the company and decided to do a deeper dive. 

**Metrics:** 

1. **ROIC**, as of today, is 12.48%. This has improved year over year since 2019(the company was private before this so financial statements only go back so far) and doubled from 2020 to 2021. While Sportsman's Warehouse has had double digit ROIC over the last few years as well, it's more sporadic and up or down with some negative returns mixed in quarterly as well. Dick's is the steadier of the 2 comparisons maintaining that ~10% ROIC over the last few years(GuruFocus).
2. **D/E ratio** is currently at about .71. The good news, however, is that because ASO exists largely in the Southern United States, they did not bleed as much during the Lockdown Era. Depending upon the state, stores were kept open and selling while competitors had to close their doors and take on more leverage to survive. This is reflected further in ASO's financial statements showing that virtually all of their existing debt is long term. Their current cash position outweighs their short term debt substantially. (Side note, their cash position has been *at least doubling* every year for the last 3 years.)
3. **P/E & PEG** ratios are 8.91 and .21, respectively. The PEG ratio is based on Finviz's EPS Next 5 years expectations, but since I'm a fan of extrapolating out a shorter amount of time from the most recent data as possible, a safer PEG ratio to assume is 8.91/11.05(Next year's EPS growth expectations), which would be .80 instead. Again, this is the *low end* EPS growth expectations for ASO. Admittedly, the previous year was a great boon for outdoor and sporting goods retailers, so instead, if you'd like to take a larger sample size of the last 5 years EPS growth it would be 8.91/32.7, or .27 PEG ratio. For a quick comparison, Dick's expected EPS for next year is an 8% growth and with a P/E of 15.77, that yields a PEG ratio of 1.9. But I didn't need to calculate that to tell you that Dick's is largely done expanding and growing. 
4. **Cash flow from Operations** has skyrocketed over the last few years, but it's important to note an anomaly. A large change in payables occurred from 2020 to 2021 which significantly impacted ASO's change in working capital. If removing it from the equation, to help get a better understanding of their cash flow operations, they still nearly *tripled* cash flow from continuing operations. Net income from continuing operations over the last few years has grown at an incredible rate too. (Yahoo Finance). Gross profit in general has followed a similar escalation path.
5. **The outside influence** of the guns & ammunition industry, while not a strict mathematical metric, should also be considered. Academy Sports, described by one of my Texas-born friends, is ""an institution."" Currently there is an on-going ammo shortage that's affecting the industry that is expected to grow at a rate of at least 6% a year through the next 5 years(Mordor Intelligence). The sports gun market is growing and many competitors simply do not offer to fill that market niche. 

**So what's the catch?**
Well, I talked about the Guns... I talked about the Money... What about the Lawyers? Academy Sports is largely owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts or KKR & Co. Inc. for short. As of this morning, they own roughly 65% of Academy Sports, making them the majority decision makers for the company. I want to be clear, **this is both good and bad**. Such a large position of ownership controlling the decisions for ASO will almost always benefit KKR moreso than other shareholders. On the other hand, KKR invested in ASO in 2011 and have helped establish the company as a quickly growing and successful retailer. The two are intertwined in a way that is mutually beneficial to each other, but not as much for shareholders. **Fortunately, this will change over time**.

Academy Sports + Outdoors announced after market on May 3rd that KKR will be issuing an additional 14 million shares of stock. For context, that accounts for roughly 1/3 of the current share float so this will dilute the shares fairly significantly. The upside to this is two-fold: 

1.  Starting today, shares should start trading a discounted, enticing price.
2. ASO also agreed to buyback as much as $100 million shares worth of the offering, thus reducing the dilution and adding to shareholder wealth. 

**Subjective analysis:** I like ASO and I like its prospects. It has the growth potential that Dick's no longer has, their management team has helped been guided by KKR to profitability, and it fills a market niche that some other competitors do not fill. It's important to note that the unraveling of KKR's shares will continue to happen over time, which will simultaneously frustrate shareholders but also spread ownership to a more reasonable degree across the Institutional spectrum. Their new focus on ecommerce has helped strengthen their bottom line and it's already started to pay dividends *without* considerable store growth. In a recent report, management had stated that 2021 won't be a time of store openings due to the inability to properly scout locations(although it was stated that 2022 should see 8-10 new openings). This is the slow growth mentality that I'm all for. This will likely be a multi-year hold for me, but it could just be the next big thing in Outdoor Sports & Recreation."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Question about P/E ratio Hey there! I’m new to the stock world and I was just learning about P/E ratio. I was having trouble understanding why it’s fair to compare P/E ratios across companies. 
I’m almost positive it is unfair to compare EPS across companies as different companies will have different numbers of shares, and while one company may have more earnings, they may have many more outstanding shares so it is unfair to compare the two with EPS.
Now when we calculate P/E ratio, we do stock price / EPS. My question is why is it now fair to use the EPS when we add the stock price in to the equation to compare the two companies.
Hope this makes sense!"

2021-05-04 09:36:10,stocks,Because now you’re looking at what the value of earnings is PER share vs what you’re paying for each share. So buying a $10 EPS company isn’t better than buying a $2 EPS company if the share price for the first company is $200 and the share price for the second company is $3 ... You’re getting $2 of earnings for $3 vs getting $10 of earnings for $200 - so by looking at EPS in the context of price per share it gives you a better understanding of what you’re getting for what you’re paying. It’s still not a standalone metric though and you should always do more research as to why a companies P/E is different than another - there’s a lot you can’t tell by just looking at ratios

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Why should we even bother investing in growth/tech at this moment in time? Let's assume the fed is right and we don't raise interest rates until ~2023, it's my understanding that raising rates is going to send growth/tech stocks down because money isn't as cheap as it used to be. Under that assumption, shouldn't that mean it would be smarter to sit these next few years out until they end up raising rates and then open long positions? I recently purchased 10 LEAPs on various growth/tech companies and plan to exercise them in the future. Would it have been smarter to just wait for the rate hikes later on or how much of that is already being priced in the market today? I plan to be these positions 5-10+ years so I'm just curious."

2021-05-04 10:12:58,stocks,"If the market correction that everyone is expecting happens tech stocks may go down, but unless we have another crash even with the corrections tech growth stocks will probably still beat the traditional value stocks.  If you are risk averse it would be wise to start rotating your investments to the traditional stocks and investments (Government securities etc).  The VIX is pretty low right so the corrections will likely lead to tech stocks becoming even more volatile.  Just note that in the long term you probably will lose out if you decide to adjust your portfolio like this."
2021-05-04 13:26:58,stocks,I don't get this logic.  Growth companies aren't primarily reliant on bank loans for raising funds why would interest rates impact their growth any more than any other company?  And honestly even if they were so what?  If Nvidia needs a loan for a billion dollars to create a new GPU manufacturing plant that will generate an additional 4 billion a year in revenue who cares if they're paying an extra point or two on the loan when their EPS just went up 40%

2021-05-04 11:29:12,stocks,"I'm no financial advisor, but I think it's entirely likely that this is part of the inflation and interest rate correction.

It could still go down much more, of course, but I think that future calculation is starting to be made."

2021-05-04 10:44:44,stocks,"You’re thinking from too small of a picture, as if the fed is the only thing that matters.  Which is very not true.  Fed watching is historically a very bad trading strategy that is only really popular among media-watching elites because it powers the news cycle in boring times

Think of it this way.  If the fed raises rates steeply and quickly, that means that the economy is doing very well.  In that case, you’re probably better off picking cyclicals because they’re probably undervalued at current levels.  

If the fed can’t raise rates that probably means the economy is relatively stagnant.  In which case growth will outperform because there’s little profit that can be eeked out of low moat cyclicals.

In either case, it’s not as if buying growth is a bad decision.  It’s just that in the case where the economy is doing well, the temporary valuation of growth will be reduced.  But those companies will still grow which over the long term will benefit your portfolio.  It’s just a question of whether you have to buy in at projected 2023 valuations or projected 2022 valuations for example.

So in short, don’t get too caught up in fed watching.  It’s the biggest sucker bet on the stock market."

If interest rates are higher, your dcf rate is higher.

True, so I'll restate my point: it's becoming increasingly difficult to find anything undervalued. I can find plenty of stocks that look promising, but digging into any of the financial metrics almost always turns up concerns or risks.

Even when a company is undervalued by most traditional metrics, there are geopolitical risks (e.g. BABA).

Ultimately, it is all about guessing which risk is exaggerated and then getting lucky."

2021-05-04 11:34:45,stocks,"Just because something is intwined with your daily life doesn’t mean you can’t be in a serious bubble. Bubbles are about valuation, not daily use. 

The world used a shit tonne of Microsoft software in the late 90’s. It was the only game in town to make businesses, government and personal lives more efficient. Yet it was still in a bubble. We could be seeing the same thing now, although I would argue with any company such as Apple and Microsoft it’s less likely, if their current P/E are less than 25-30. Than indicates it may be ~only 25% overvalued at most, so the downside is limited. 

The rest of QQQ though and other disruptive space?  Watch out. 75% drop easily is coming"

Not arguing - but that’s my point in my initial reply. If you’re a 10+ year holder - buy and forget. Could it pull back hard? Sure. Will it pull back hard? Who knows. Trying to decide based on interest rates and when things may cycle is a fools errand."
2021-05-04 16:57:06,stocks,"I agree.

But also what you should have in mind is that investing is a long time (3-5) years effort.

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Can options contracts trigger a wash sale? Hello,I recently reading about the wash sale adjustment and was wondering if it also applies to the below options scenario:

Suppose I have 100 shares of XYZ and do the following:

1. I first sell a call option with September expiration against these shares.  I place the order in May, with the aim of selling them at $10. Let's assume the $10 strike price would generate a loss
2. Next, I buy 100 shares at $10 in May.
3. Then in September at expiration, I am forced to sell my initial 100 shares due to the price of XYZ going above $10.

Since I placed the option contract in May, would that trigger the30 day  wash sale rule?"
2021-05-04 11:45:29,stocks,"If you write a call option, that can trigger a wash sale on the underlying. A wash sale is only triggered in this instance if you rebuy the same underlying after selling at a loss though.

This specific scenario would not trigger a wash sale. 

Options and stock are different securities, so options do not trigger wash sales on stock trades and vice-versa. 

Below would trigger a wash sale. 

1. You have 100 shares of XYZ at $15.

2. You write a call option to sell XYZ at $10.

3. Suppose within 30 days after the option expires ITM (you sell your shares to whoever holds the option contract) you buy 100 shares of XYZ at the current price."

new products (though i cannot comment on that other than it sounds good)

>“We are thrilled with our first quarter financial performance and  strategic progress. End demand remained strong for our products and our  new products such as the K65 mini RGB keyboard and Elgato’s new  accessories debuted well. We introduced 29 new products in the first  quarter and we expect this blistering pace of new product introduction  to continue throughout the year with several brand new products still to  come. Supplies of key components remain tight but we have been able to  support our plans and will continue to work on this issue for the rest  of the year. As a result of our stronger-than-expected first quarter  performance and our current views for the rest of the year, we raised  our 2021 annual guidance,” stated Andy Paul, Chief Executive Officer of  Corsair.

reducing debt by 28 million despite the increase in all financial metrics.

>“We were able to convert our strong financial performance in the first  quarter into an opportunity to further strengthen our balance sheet. We  reduced debt by an additional $28 million with outstanding principal now  at $299 million and net debt at $177.3 million. We did this while  growing quickly and leaving sufficient resources to help us grow  further. We continue to evaluate growth opportunities while still  expecting to further reduce our existing debt in 2021,” said Michael G.  Potter, Chief Financial Officer of Corsair."
2021-05-04 11:39:14,stocks,"The reaction today has nothing to do with Corsair the entire market is down.  Just use Amazon last week as a reference when it shot up past $3,600 to ATH in after hours before losing 2% the next day from close to close.  Blowout earnings for a specific company has never seemed to be able to override a really bad day in the market.  

Corsair is a pretty safe stock overall.  When you look at its EV/EBITDA, Foward P/S, Foward P/E and Free Cash Flow you realize it's a solid company with not much downside.  I'd hold Corsair over any of these other small cap/mid cap tech stocks that are trading at dangerous levels."

Some important notes however, revenue is down compared to 2020 Q4 (not the holiday season), while profits and margins are up from Q4. 

Supply-chain is still an ongoing issue, but they claim to have handled it fine. Considering that Paul said in Q4 that stock was being sold out, the fact they maintained their sales in Q1 shows that they have managed to keep the supply coming.

Question for others, can someone explain to me their cash-flow from operations? Only 27M in Q1 (68M in Q4), is it just a common fluctuation in inventories, or something else benign or should I dig deeper into this?"

Just an FYI OP, these metrics are irrelevant stated like this. Fundamental valuations care about margins (i.e. what % of revenue was gross profit or op inc), not absolute figures. The answer to ""Did they expand or compress margins (from prior results)?"" shows whether or not they improved on those specific metrics."

The actual selling season is late July early August typically then September sucks but after that we run to the moon. I’ve been trading for 12 years and every year I raise cash end of January end of April end of July and then go hardcore in October. Seasonality rarely changes except for a Covid type event.

Everybody bought the products they need and it will take 3-4 years to get profits like this again? \[cyclical product/overhyped buy/\] negative earnings past few years \[maybe due to acquisitions but still...\] 30% of stockholders equity\[370m of the 500m is in goodwill\] Increasing inventories when demand is going to drop off when covid ends. 4 of my friends bought webcams for our desktop we probably would've never bought webcams if not for covid.In 2020, 2019 and 2018, Amazon accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue, at 24.6%, 25.1% and 22.4%, respectively.reliance on amazon for profit margins.... Gamestop entering space... Amazon entering space... competitors are growing and taking small margins.

**There P/E is 30 during the greatest economic event ever for gaming \[covid\]. Seriously your overpaying.**

Short 10-20%... If a company is short more then 5% you should ask yourself the bear thesis.

2021-05-04 15:03:12,stocks,"I think a few reasons:

First, this was a January meme stock that left a load of retail traders bag holding in the 37+ range.  Those retail traders, which didnt do great DD and think that being long means selling 6 weeks after a purchase for a 25% gain, have watched it slowly cycle between 31 and 34.5 for a few months.  I think there were a LOT of people selling today no matter what - either hoping for a pop or just out of frustration.

Secondly, big money doesnt care much about 1 earnings report.  It is just one small data point in a long thesis for the company.  Bull and bear cases on an institutional level look down the road at least 3-5 years.  In corsair, they see a low moat company with average projected growth and high margins.  Their IPO was less than a year ago so they dont have a strong history of hitting earnings targets to lean on. 
 There are a lot of questions around them being able to maintain sales and margins in the long term, and for that reason they arent going to get a 30+ p/e ratio like some growth stocks do.   

Corsair is going to have to show that its recent success is sustainable and that its growth targets are achievable for it to have long term price growth.  It's also going to have to power past a significant amount of paper handed retail traders which could slow it down further.

All that being said, I'm long Corsair as long as they grow sales and maintain margin."

2021-05-04 09:49:59,stocks,"P/E of 30? They've only reported 3 quarters of earnings since going public, just the last 3 quarters their EPS totals to $1.65, a P/E of 30 would imply a share price of $49.50, so you're clearly way off.

Even if they manage to only report .35 next quarter the ttm EPS would be $2, a P/E of only 20 would imply a price of $40/share.

Amazon isn't exactly known for making high-end products, I highly doubt they are getting into this space anytime soon anymore than they already have with their ""Amazon Basics"" brand.

"" demand is going to drop off when covid ends "" - This whole covid ending talk is so overblown, how long are we going to use this narrative? We're 14 months into this pandemic, if somebody wanted to get into gaming or needed peripherals to work from home they would have did it 6 to 14 months ago."
2021-05-04 09:03:35,stocks,"CRSR's valuation really comes down to whether or not you believe that it can perform on the same level post-covid. Obviously the pandemic was really good for Corsair, but I'm not convinced those first quarter numbers reflect that too much. The U.S. are opening up, it's just that people like gaming, and will continue to do so.

The shorters clearly believe that Corsair's sales will drop when people go outside again. Personally, I think people will continue to buy gaming stuff even when they can go outside, just like they did before Covid."

2021-05-04 10:53:39,stocks,"look at today's earnings posted. it's been more than a year of the pandemic and they're growing earnings 50x times. 2020 Q1 was an onset of pandemic. by your logic you would assume everybody would buy PCs back then and not buy anything for the next 3-4 years. However, earnings for 2021 Q1 are 50 times larger than for 2020 Q1.

the company is improving margins, paying off debt, launching new products successfully, entering new (software and streaming) markets successfully, and growing with 300%+ growth rate more than a year into pandemic (when you would expect everybody to already buy their PCs and gear if they wanted due to pandemic). and they're doing it all at 30 P/E, which is a really low P/E. companies that grow that fast have 1000 P/E like Tesla or even negative P/E like Uber, Spotify, AirBnb.

btw, based on today's earnings, their P/E will soon drop to 15-20 if the price of stock doesn't pick up, which is ridiculous for an IT company (even hardware, even if it was growing 5% instead of 300%)."
2021-05-04 09:33:29,stocks,"Regarding inventories, since second half last year they were afraid of supply issues and still mention it as a top risk for this year. I don't know what their inventories consist of, but I'm inclined on the ""increase in inventories is good"" at this particular instance.

It’s natural, the share price will likely go up. As long as they continue on their current trajectory, in 5 years time their share price could be more than double what it is now."

2021-05-04 09:09:00,stocks,Its a solid example of why revenues are so high.
2021-05-04 12:25:32,stocks,"Revenues attached as i do think hes somewhat right on P/E Good insight there ARP! [https://gyazo.com/6472f29c6f2d5841ee57d92829260bf3](https://gyazo.com/6472f29c6f2d5841ee57d92829260bf3) \[attached\]

Next if you see they barely had revenue gains then they made a massive jump \[if you actually look they were losing money pre covid due to acquisitions\].

**iTS NOW PRICED AS IF THIS COVID GROWTH WILL CONTINUE A 70% GROWTH IS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE ITS BEING SHORTED 20% FOR THIS VERY REASON YOUR OVERBUYING A STOCK FOR 50-70% OVER PRICE IN A MARKET WITH 12% GROWTH\[GAMING\]**

P/E Numbers

.43/SHARE-FEB 9 21

.47/SHARE-MAY 4 21

.43/SHARE-NOV 10 2020

.43+.47+.43=1.33 So p/e is around 18:1\[24/1 with just 3 quarters\] once next quarter gets filed. For the biggest boom in company history from covid. If you can share where your getting 1.65 i'd appreciate it.

**Demand will drop off** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network\_effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) The network effect occurred because once people got on pc there friends got on and will that continue post covid sure... But not on the same scale people won't have excess income to buy gaming stuff when there going to concerts/movies/drinking.

Amazon might not compete but Crsr margin on products is **30%** how big do you think the company can grow before people say wow a 40b industry in gaming pcs/tech we should probably take a pie @ 18% profit margins. People don't let high profit margins last forever its a gold mine right now. People are rushing left and right to compete CRSR has solid branding.

In conclusion

TLDR: CRSR revenues will **decrease** in 2021 Starting in November \[once covid is done\] Crsr stock price will crash as more people realize it's an overvalued gaming peripheral company.Competition will come in and drive down profit margins. Price target:18-22$/share end of 2022\~"
2021-05-04 09:12:53,stocks,This is definitely what I'm trying to get at thanks for the valuable input. The biggest concern is amazon... If gaming gets any bigger amazon will make higher end gaming gear/computers.... corsair relys on amazon for 30% of revenue that is not good!
2021-05-04 09:15:55,stocks,I don't know how high 15% DTC is \[I think currently its 10%\~ don't quote me i read there numbers last month\]... But remember if you believe revenue grows in CRSR amazon get more enticed to build better pc gaming parts or buy a company like turtle beach out. You are playing a double-edged sword. Especially when 25-30% of revenues come from amazon. I don't like buying companies which growth prospects are halted by other competitors with DTC edges. Corsair has a great brand image. But is it worth 4b\~ time will tell.
2021-05-04 12:32:18,stocks,">n more than a year of the pandemic and they're growing earnings 50x times. 2020 Q1 was an ons

2021-05-04 12:25:57,stocks,"Inventories increasing is a good sign till its not... You know who else in prospectus puts similar comments... Cabbage patch kids 1980?\~... Power rangers 1990s\~.. All these companys are now Bankrupt or Cash strangled.  These were cyclical toys with huge margins that died out. I don't think CRSR has the same issues as these companys but they do have a product which gained immense popularity during a cyclial event \[covid\].  

**Issues:**

1. **Cyclical product explosion I think the pc gaming explosion will continue but it will defintely not be a increasing slope i think the decline is coming.**
2. Margins will decrease currently CRSR makes 38% margin on pc items \[mice/keyboard\] Make 30% margin on pc's. There image is good but there margins are great and that will soon catch up leading to lower margins/profits/advertising capabilities.
3. Debt they have 800m\~ in liabilities and  130m cash/300m acct rec/234m in inventory/50m in credits=712m. So they got alot of debt and a potential for major issues if demand slumps. 

In conclusion, do I think corsair is a bad company No! Do I think it's a good company yes! But the question isn't where it's a good company or not it's whether it's a good stock and @ 27$+ it's a terrible buy IMO. Enjoy."
2021-05-04 09:09:43,stocks,"Why are you acting so emotional. 

This is someone providing a genuine bear thesis, which is useful. Even if you don’t agree with it it’s worth thinking about potentially downsides for a trade. 

Otherwise you can just join an echo chamber where you ignore any negative ideas and circlejerk yourself off. Sounds like a losing way to trade though"

2021-05-04 09:12:11,stocks,"I disagree. I think covid is just accelerating the digital age. Streamers & video creators all had/have webcams pre-covid, and so did I.

My personal view is that young generation of gamers are continuing to shift over to the PC space. 

You mention around GameStop & Amazon - a potential squeeze in margins. however with their reputation and size these partnerships will in my mind increase either footfall or direct untapped commercial opportunities.

Corsair will just continue to horizontally or vertically integrate, and bring their brand reputation & quality with it."
2021-05-04 10:27:36,stocks,Considering Corsair doesn't sell webcams...
2021-05-04 14:57:44,stocks," I was looking at adjusted net income for the EPS numbers, so we can use your numbers.    

I'm not sure how you've determined that the stock is being priced as if the 70% growth will continue, we all know those numbers aren't sustainable, but the P/E is in the 20s & they are trading under 2 P/S, which is hardly expensive compared to the rest of the stock market.    

Gaming industry growth is estimated at 12.7% CAGR through 2027, there's no reason that they can't continue to grow revenue.     

They sell more than just peripheral's, gamers upgrade their PC builds every 3-5 years, so there will always be demand for cases, power supply, ram, etc. Plus they are selling pre-built PC's now as well.    

One of those acquisitions that you mention back when they were losing money was Elgato, which is one of/if not the top brand for streaming products. Search for Elgato on Amazon, what I see is a lot of products designed for streamers priced from $100-$300 with thousands of 5-star reviews, that tells me there is high demand for the brand & that the products are of high quality. These are very high margin products & the demand is going to continue, as streaming is a massively growing segment of the gaming market.    

I agree that demand will drop off, but not as drastic as you seem to imply, and maybe some small profit margin retraction as well.     

I'm not going to comment on competition coming to the market because that's just speculation, Corsair has been around a long time, so have the 2 other main players Logitech & Razer, they've all managed to coexist just fine."
2021-05-04 10:44:19,stocks,does Amazon produce computer gear?
2021-05-04 09:25:59,stocks,Yes I see the point - dependency on a big retailer that might vertically integrate and compete later. Pontentially that's why they are moving to the streaming / content creation arena (I assume also its higher margin as it might in part be software with 0 marginal cost)... but that's me hand-waving now.
2021-05-04 16:29:35,stocks,"Regarding inventories in general, I don´t agree. Previous quarter their inventories decreased and they raised supply problems as their limiting factor for growth in 2021. Also they sell 70% more than the same period last year. I understand the concept of of filling your warehouses with inventory you can´t sell, but it just isn´t what I see here. Corsair has been around for decades and has been and is actively expanding their product portfolio and market diversity. Sure, gaming can suffer slowdown or decrease even, but this is a bit of a moot case. I am convinced of the strength and growth of gaming and want to invest in it. If it turns out gaming is on a way down... well so be it. I´ll be fucked anyway, Corsair or otherwise.

1) I am not expecting 70-100% growth to continue, but 2020 was not an exceptional one off boom for gaming, but a huge catalyst in an already fast growing industry that won´t stop growing for decades. That is my case for gaming. Again, I can be wrong, but if I´m wrong, I have a problem outside of CRSR.

2) CRSR margins are certainly not too high or unsustainable. In fact I expect an improvement in margins going forward. They are not comparable 1-1 but LOGI net margin is about twice as high as CRSR and I expect CRSR to continue improving their margins (as they have for past year). As CRSR markets itself as a top market product, I expect them to have the ability to achieve and maintain high and higher margins.

3) CRSR´s balance sheet isn´t ideal, but it isn´t particularly bad either, and they have been improving it all the past year as well as Q1 2021 and intending to continue to pay down debt throughout 2021. Their earning guidance for 2021 and results of Q1 certainly make it possible.

In conclusion, fair valuation for CRSR is heavily dependant on what you see their potential growth as. Your case assumes no growth or weak growth. I too consider the valuation for CRSR in my worst case scenario where they don´t manage growth above nominal economic growth to be between 25-30$. I however see them continuing to grow at least 15% a year and improvement in margins, putting the fair valuation between 60-80$."

Search for Elgato on Amazon, what I see is a lot of products designed for streamers priced from $100-$300 with thousands of 5-star reviews, that tells me there is high demand for the brand & that the products are of high quality. These are very high margin products & the demand is going to continue, as streaming is a massively growing segment of the gaming market.I agree that demand will drop off, but not as drastic as you seem to imply, and maybe some small profit margin retraction as well.I'm not going to comment on competition coming to the market because that's just speculation, Corsair has been around a long time, so have the 2 other main players Logitech & Razer, they've all managed to coexist just fine.

You mean a growing industry?

>Its not hard to conclude if gamers are buying webcams\[that other product sales are increasing\]...

Gamers aren't buying webcams. PC users are. If you want to show that PC peripheral sales are increasing, webcams is an odd choice considering the millions of people pushed to a work from home position. 


>Also they do sell webcam type products from subsidiaries FWIW.

Camlink isn't a webcam. Corsair and it's subsidiaries do not sell webcams. Your anecdotal evidence about you and your friends purchasing them is irrelevant."

2021-05-04 16:19:51,stocks,"read the thread.

some quick comments:

1. they recently expanded to streaming software, launched a bunch of products, and plan to keep growing rapidly - CEO said on the call that they will keep R&D and marketing and focus on expanding, so it's unrealistic to expect them to go back to 2017-2019 levels
2. they also have improved their balance sheet significantly by paying off high interest debt in 2020 and will keep repaying it in 2021. so even if revenue drops to 2017-2019 levels (which is unrealistic), they'll have much better net margin than they had in 2017-2019.  
let's say revenue drops twice but net margin stays the same, then you'd have $.58/2=$.29 earnings this quarter or $1.16 annualized, which would give you 32/1.16=28 P/E even if Revenue dropped twice, which will never happen. it will either drop by \~5% just next year but then will keep growing at \~15% which is gaming/streaming market growth, or even not drop at all and will just stay flat for a year and then grow at \~15%.

just my 2 cents. thanks for discussion and have a nice week."
2021-05-04 12:14:09,stocks,">Does amazon make any high quality physical objects?

Yes to both. They own the highest quality grocery store in america or one of them.They can easily buy turtle beaches and rebrand it or buy another audio company be aware that your buying a stock based on future growth and future growth has competition factors. Thats how stocks are priced....

How much growth can CRSR make if it couldn't it'd be 10-15$/share but people think it's going to grow big to 8-16b market cap\~ which means you need nobody with a potential competitive advantage investing views should look and see how strong the ""economic moat as a whole is"" Its concerning so many don't with this investment."

We're 14 months into this pandemic, if somebody wanted to get into gaming or needed peripherals to work from home they would have did it 6 to 14 months ago.    

I'd actually argue the high # of cases in Q1 2021 helps my argument because that shows that people weren't staying locked in their homes, they were out spreading COVID."

2021-05-04 12:32:25,stocks,"Alright, so my portfolios biggest two positions are amazon and corsair.

I do close to literally all my shopping off amazon and quickly searched over my 10 year buying history with them. Literally only amazon made product I've bought were bedsheets. Amazon is more than happy to just have third parties sell on the site, it's where the vast majority of their retail income comes from. With very few exceptions, the products they make are cheap and of ""acceptable I guess"" quality.

Their only high quality products is stuff like kindle, which is just made to sell you other things and...Alexa I guess?

But to bring this back to gaming, I took a look at their keyboards for example. Their mechanical keyboard had 15x less reviews and reviewed considerably worse than the one model of the corsair k70. Now bear in mind that there are multiple models of the K70, on top of all the other CRSR keyboards and amazon literally just had the one mechanical keyboard option. 

For Amazon to get into this market they'd need to seriously invest in a new high quality brand, market it and slowly gain market share. Can they do that? You'd think so, but if you look at how their recent efforts have been into producing their own games, maybe not. But even if they can, the more important question is will they? They seem far more preoccupied investing in AWS and whatever else rather than physical products."
2021-05-04 15:18:01,stocks,Most Amazon branded stuff is pretty much just white label surplus they pick up from China and slap their logo on. I wouldn't call that 'making' as much as it is just distributing. The only things I would bet they actually design / make are Kindles and Alexa's

( X ) Doubt -- no reason to try and sell me on some bullshit, even Nintendo isn't at 10 p/e

To put 30 p/e in perspective, that's right around where some other bloated gaming stocks are that have clearly peaked. In this category we might put EA and Activision.

Do I think the p/e is going to go lower? Sure. The company's own guidance doesn't really think so, but I'm an optimist. I'm such an optimist I'll say Corsair Gaming's own finance wiz kids are wrong, and the p/e will go as low as 26 on revenue alone -- which would obviously be great. 

But 25 p/e is a hefty premium just for the word ""gaming"" in an otherwise normal hardware company. For comparison: Logitech is at 19, Netapp is at 20, Supermicro is at 20, Seagate is at 15 and I guess Dell is at 23"
2021-05-04 12:47:11,stocks,"The ATH prices were with only 5% of float available, so it was very risky to hold through lockup expiry. It's still not a bad investment regardless, just that it's not worth if you're only holding a small amount of shares since it'll take another year or 2 to hit above $28 and give you a solid profit."
2021-05-04 15:46:27,stocks,"$.58 for this quarter. if you assume the next 3 quarters of 2021 will be about the same, you'll get $2.32. which results in currently 32/2.32=13.8 P/E.

first half of the year is usually weaker than the second half due to holiday season, thus you would expect the earnings to be actually higher later in the year. plus, they also just repaid a big chunk of debt ($28mil), which will make a positive effect throughout the year.

thus, if the price stays the same at \~32, you can see this stock to have \~10 P/E, which is crazy. because as you say, even boring mature companies like Dell have 20+ P/E. and CRSR is a fast-pace growing company (\~80 new products launched recently, expanding to streaming and growing in software, etc.)."

The entire industry makes money off of people who are chasing this “dream” of beating the market... and for what reason? To fluff your ego, to tell others that you beat the market? 
The United States stock market has been in existence since the late 1800s and there isn’t one single human being, not one, who has beaten the market for a period longer than 15 years. People love, actually people love to quote a false narrative that Wallstreet firms have put out, when they quote Peter Lynch saying he beat the market for 13 years. That is another lie, 10 out of those 13 years Peter Lynch managed Fidelity’s Magellan fund, the market outperformed. If you had faith in Lynch, and held on to your investment for all 13 years, sure you would have come out beating the market when you average everything.
But you need to ask yourself, do you think you have the stomach to go through that volatility, when you’re constantly filled with FUD and tempted with the next best crypto or NFT or real estate or whatever hottest IPO out there?"

You're at a disadvantage because
1. You likely have to go to work from 9-5 and don't have as much time to research larger macro trends occurring. Think Bonds, Inflation, technical indicators.

2. And more importantly, you never know when those massive funds all decide to change sectors and rotate. You can be up 50% one month and find yourself down 30% within a few months because large institutions start rotating out of positions."

2021-05-04 07:22:18,stocks,"I’m glad you mentioned Buffett. That is another name that the industry loves to abuse. Benjamin Graham who mentored Buffett during his early days did run a fund which beat the US market for a period a little more than 10 years. Buffett did follow that strategy when he managed the Buffett Partnership for about 10 years until he realized it is impossible to deal with human greed. Graham followed a strategy back in the day of spending hours going through a company’s financial statements to identify large cap stocks that are severely undervalued. This strategy is out there now, with many people thinking they will identify some hidden treasure, and as such Graham’s strategy no longer works, which he himself confirmed in the 1975 updated version of his book “The Intelligent Investor”. If you are capable of not falling asleep while reading through a Finance textbook, “Security Analysis” by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd will explain the fundamental analysis Graham used to follow, which Buffett used in his early days. 
Nowadays, the industry shares a lot of false information, misquoting Buffett for the things he has said. If you look deep into it, you will realize an individual named Warren E. Buffett who files his taxes as “Married filing jointly” did not beat the US stock market. On the other hand, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. whose stock trades on the NYSE has had a better return that the S&P 500 for a period little over 30 years. Berkshire is the only exception to the rule.

There is a theory in Accounting literature called “The Efficient Market Hypothesis” which simply states no one individual/ organization has knowledge more than the collective market. During the older days this theory was hated on by Wallstreet firms because this will run them out of business. But technology nowadays has made things so efficient, that any information about a company is made available to the public within a matter of seconds.. 
If you want a simple answer to your question, “The Little Book on Common Sense Investing” by Jack C. Bogle will show your the numbers and the statistical formula that you can use to calculate for yourself why it is a loser’s game to try to beat the market. Or if you’re someone who likes dealing with complicated Accounting terms to finally get the answer you are looking for, start with “The Intelligent Investor”, then study “Security Analysis” and then try to see if you can put it into practice. You will eventually accept this concept called “Reversion to the mean” which shows you why no one has beaten the market for more than a decade."
2021-05-04 06:08:27,stocks,"That’s not beating tho, that’s just increasing risk"

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

2021-05-04 12:46:28,stocks,"Sucks I didn’t play this season the best but definitely took good notes:

- Never, EVER be impatient. Even with your holdings. The market will give you a new opportunity sooner or later

- Don’t load up on your positions before earnings. It’s too volatile a time to risk it. Save your money in case they dip after so you can average down at a better price. 


- Furthermore, don’t buy a company that had killer earnings and price action for a while. Wait to see where its price settles before buying. Even large caps can get pumped and dumped. 


- If you notice an overexposure, try to deal with it during green times. It’ll hurt more t rebalance as things start taking a hit. 

- Not every dip should be bought. Sometime it’s fine to let a “discount” go.

- If a position you just bought starts tanking straight away, don’t average down right away. Give it a day or 2 to better judge its momentum. 


Making these mistakes blow but learning from them will help me get better in time."

It almost feels like it's creating a recovery bubble while tech dries out. It's hard to know what to get into at this stage, but I'm buying tech. If we ever do manage to get over the uncertainty, things will pop. Personally, I will be continuing to add to Amazon while it stays under 3.5k."

I have a future position and i paid $100 with (x15 leverage) and now I have $450.

My question is it a good idea/time to increase my ammount or no?

For example what happenes if I increase the ammount by $100 (put $100) more? Am i gonna buy more at the current price or its like I am buying more shares at the initial price I bought them? So if i increase my amount by $100 am i gonna be winning $900 ($450x2 because i double my initial investment) or it doesnt work that way?

Thanks for the help.

Most don’t understand wtf is going on in this market, including myself. And like most I make up my own story in order to be at ease and decide what to buy /sell. 

Overall think the explanation is quite easy and straightforward. “THE MARKET IS CONSTIPATED” Since last year it ate a ton of sh## SPACS, sh## EV stocks, wanna be vaccine wanna be biopharma companies & dinosaur brick & mortar retailers who sold 3 garments online and think they deserve a multiple expansion and just avoiding their unavoidable demise. 

The market is actually so constipated it can’t seem to move or pick a direction and forget about allowing the crown jewels; MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, GS, JPM etc making a more than deserved move upwards after blow out earnings reports & guidance. 

But we all have been constipated at some point on our lives.  And we also know the only true and efficient remedy is to take a massive DUM* and get rid of all the sh##.  And let’s face it, it’s not whether it will happen it’s just a question of when.  And after last week and yesterday it may be much closer than we all may all think."

I thought you only pay tax if you transfer out of trading account and into your bank. Any insight would be very helpful. Thank you.

But then after your deposit goes through, are the shares still considered margin? Are they still being loaned out?"

2021-05-04 15:20:59,stocks,"I think a few reasons:

First, this was a January meme stock that left a load of retail traders bag holding in the 37+ range.  Those retail traders, which didnt do great DD and think that being long means selling 6 weeks after a purchase for a 25% gain, have watched it slowly cycle between 31 and 34.5 for a few months.  I think there were a LOT of people selling today no matter what - either hoping for a pop or just out of frustration.

Secondly, big money doesnt care much about 1 earnings report.  It is just one small data point in a long thesis for the company.  Bull and bear cases on an institutional level look down the road at least 3-5 years.  In corsair, they see a low moat company with average projected growth and high margins.  their IPO was less than a year ago so they dont have a strong history of hitting earnings targets to lean on. 
 There are a lot of questions around them being able to maintain sales and margins in the long term, and for that reason they arent going to get a 30+ p/e ratio like some growth stocks do.   

Corsair is going to have to show that its recent success is sustainable and that its growth targets are achievable for it to have long term price growth.  It's also going to have to power past a significant amount of paper handed retail traders which could slow it down further.

All that being said, I'm long Corsair as long as they grow sales and maintain margin."

But seriously, there’s been at least 9 awesome earnings reports this last month. AAPL, AMD, CRSR, all red and trading sideways if you zoom out.

2021-05-04 19:43:15,stocks,I started investing in March of 2020 and there is still so much to learn. My biggest advice is to not panic and sell on red days. That only confirms you losing the money. There has been several times I’ve done this and within the next few weeks I would be back positive. Buy stocks in increments to avoid getting a bad average cost per share.
2021-05-04 18:14:00,stocks,I think Google and Microsoft are much less overvalued and have stronger fundamentals than ARK at the moment. All of them may experience a correction in the short term though. But I’d sleep much better with the bulk of FAANG(M) in my portfolio by comparison

2021-05-04 10:17:08,stocks,"My guess is you are 30 or younger. Your time horison is more than 20 years. Take a look back at any point in past. if you buy and hold for 20 years or more even if you were to have bought before a crash, you would doing very well.

Ex: if you bought in 2007 right before the crash (almost -40% loss in just a year),

sp500 in 2007: 1477  
sp500 in 2008: 1220   
sp500 in 2020: 2600 (+76% since 2007)

Plus you are a probably gonna keep adding to your positions as you get older. So its no problem.

I just wanted to show you this to prove that you are perfectly fine. As long as your time horizon in 15 or more, you have nothing to worry about. When you start getting close to retirement, then you need to think about transitionning into very stable/safe strategies.

The BEST thing you did was starting investing when you did. Don't worry about it :)"

2021-05-04 15:57:43,stocks,A lot of those have been running for weeks if not months. With the nonstop rotations happening in this market it seems like a terrible idea to buy in now IMO. Oil might be undervalued though.

2021-05-04 12:37:54,stocks,"You're swing trading like crazy. Today is not much more than an annoyance for most people, and definitely not something to panic sell over. Investing is a marathon, not a sprint.

A few meandering thoughts that will hopefully help you: 

Don't buy based on hype unless you know what's going on. 

Do your research and buy what you understand.

Take some time to look at long term trends and compare them with companies you want to buy stocks in. 

The market (right now) grows 10-12% per year and people make and break careers by trying to beat that. If something looks too good to be true, it probably is. If you see something with 300% growth after 6 months then the rocket has already launched. ^(*Curses PLTR investment*) 

Also learn to read basic financials: understanding P/E ratios, EPS, net profits etc will go a long way to helping you build a good portfolio.

Edit:

I forgot to add do your research. Seriously, this is the big one for anyone considering active investing. 

Every time you see a new term, read about it in investopedia. Warren Buffet got where he is largely thanks to him studying his investments. GME was started by Keith Gill poring through the financial with a fine tooth comb..."

You didn't lose, you just didn't win, but Doge could just as easily have gone the other way. Hundreds of people win the lottery or take home huge sums of money from the casino too; doesn't necessarily means those are risk-averse things to do. FOMO is the easiest way to lose money.

2021-05-04 06:05:17,stocks,"Genuine question - what are you hoping / planning for?

Even after yesterday's close, ETSY is still up roughly 283%, year on year.  If it's undervalued, what do you see as being a fair value?"

2021-05-04 15:14:58,stocks,"Yep 2021 has been a purely ""sell before earnings"" year. It's actually pretty nice with calls, due to IV crush after earnings, as well as the price dropping after earnings, there are really nice call prices immediately after earnings."
2021-05-04 15:33:30,stocks,"Yep I'm used to it now, but was hoping since CRSR had been beaten down there wasn't much profit to be made by selling the earnings news, but rather that it could give it the catalyst it needed to be interesting again. Seems like that can happen to the small caps. But alas, it got caught in the interest rate news from Yellen I guess."
2021-05-04 16:34:32,stocks,It is 11% up in the year so it is not going to drop 10% unless something huge happens. Last CPI report was totally under control and next one will be the same.
2021-05-04 16:19:41,stocks,What’s your basis for all of that?

2021-05-04 10:10:53,stocks,"Yeah, if the Nasdaq is not bouncing, you're going to see ARKK fail where it bounced back in March. While ARKK doesn't have to follow them tit for tit, it'd help if it was doing well.

And to be honest, the Nasdaq is in serious trouble imo. I don't really think it revisits its intraday low from March 5th, but given that tech earnings have been front ran apparently the last few times, it definitely could have more to go."
2021-05-04 16:19:16,stocks,"CLF, VALE, CVS, EPD, BP, IYF, XLE offset a lot of my tech losses.  Also, they are good dividend stocks.  I'm glad you are doing better."
2021-05-04 16:16:04,stocks,"Financials will continue to run as rates go higher IMO.  Housing market is showing no signs of slowing down and summer is usually the hottest part of the year in terms of real estate.  Steel/copper/lumber prices keeps going higher.  I won't say they are undervalued.  They are fairly valued now with room to run upwards.

I do agree oil is undervalued."

2021-05-04 10:12:51,stocks,"That's the key issue is people who bought in within the last several months haven't seen any returns at all for the most part. At least nothing of note. Every time it looks like it's finally going to break loose, it pulls back. It is very frustrating for many. It is easy to shrug off for the folks that are up 50 - 60% because they got in last year or even further back."
2021-05-04 09:12:14,stocks,I just think that shows how some people have unrealistic expectations and are also impatient.

Buffett touched on this on his recent talk: out of the 20 biggest companies of thirty years ago, not a single one remains among the biggest 20 of today.

Pretty sure that at the time those names sounded invincible too."

 Buffet said don't copy what he did, but do what he said.

If you really want to copy his portfolio, copy his buy-in price, too"
2021-05-04 10:24:41,stocks,This is the way
2021-05-04 12:11:41,stocks,"I feel you, but I didn't totally mean to drag them through the mud. I actually caved in and sold my lowest conviction picks last week and put them in index funds.  I just realized there was no way I was going to beat the market, as they always said, and my supposedly defensive portfolio turned out to not really do that well on red days. 

But I did keep my highest conviction defensive stocks, which ended up just being 3.  They are solid companies with steady revenue streams and amazing dividends, and they will provide fixed income no matter what the rest of the market is doing.  I decided that it wasn't a horrible idea to keep 20% or so in this type of investment, especially given how hot the market has been and how uncertain things are.

In a broader sense, I understand why people recommend index funds.  I really do.  Like I said, I'm well over 50% in them. But I do think there are caveats to any approach and there's nothing wrong with doing your own research and figuring out what suits your needs and risk tolerance. As long as one is willing to keep and open mind and learn when things don't work out.  

I also think that it's a lot easy to buffer yourself from downside than to actually beat index funds in terms of upside potential."
2021-05-04 16:03:09,stocks,"That's the rub. 

Big Tech will be fine long term but some of the speculative small caps may continue to trend lower since the appetite is gone. 

Remember S&P never corrected along with Russell and Tech. If S&P corrects I expect things to get dire in some sectors"
2021-05-04 10:13:07,stocks,i’m liking the dip today for a potential buy. isn’t that a short term etf though?
2021-05-04 11:54:03,stocks,Yup there are a few ways to invest in inflationary market. Gold and real estate typically do well. Companies like I suggested will likely still be okay as well as the commodity producers like you suggest.
2021-05-04 11:01:51,stocks,no jokes allowed huh alright then
2021-05-04 11:10:42,stocks,Us sails. Im assuming the price will jump a little bit. plus my long term kicks in soon
2021-05-04 11:36:04,stocks,isnt ark more of an ETF? or because its actively managed it could be considered the same thing?

2021-05-04 19:54:40,stocks,I deleted my post. With investing.com down I was using another site that not differentiate between daily market and futures markets
2021-05-04 07:33:00,stocks,Nah I'd be selling too low here. I do plan on selling half eventually though
2021-05-04 07:34:55,stocks,Nah doge has too big of a cult following now. If I lose it all I wouldn't be mad anyway this was a gamble originally but it feels less so now. Doge is on a steady climb upwards. 1 dollar is gonna happen sooner then alot of people think. Even at 1 dollar that's only 128 billion market cap. 5 to 10 dollars can and probably will happen
2021-05-04 14:58:39,stocks,"Rip! Saying that, If I would have bought when my friend said to, there is no way I would have held till today. Think I would have panic sold after it  dumped after hitting .08 that one day."
2021-05-04 08:27:16,stocks,Skipped that one actually. Was semi hard at 24.. but I think it keeps sliding and revenue projections are a little ..... not there. Could pop if youre a 2-5 year hold and maybe an average ALL the way down.
2021-05-04 09:49:21,stocks,When you buy the dip but it dips further....
2021-05-04 11:52:53,stocks,When did you buy them?
2021-05-04 08:05:01,stocks,This stock has a pattern of going slightly above 40 and then selling of to 35 or a little higher every week. I had enough of the pattern and sold at 41 long ago but dont be surprised if you see this go to 40 and then back to 35 just hours later
2021-05-04 08:14:13,stocks,Probably worded my comment a bit wrong. With the earnings being better I expected a bit more than 56 cents up. We saw a nice steady rise leading into the financials being released in February but it felt like it was widely expected to be a blow out. Think I was too optimistic on a pre market knee jerk reaction if there was a good estimates beat this morning. Hopeful for the rest of the day! Sitting at a $37 average. Relatively new to the stock market so maybe looking at historic data and trends over volume and general sentiment.
2021-05-04 11:22:17,stocks,"No, she did indeed say that and I'm guessing ""they"" got the word this morning."

2021-05-04 15:47:42,stocks,"Yea I would agree. Not to say either option screams bargain at the moment, but I think Apple has much more upside and growth potential than say WMT. It’s not like WMT pays a handsome dividend either."
2021-05-04 19:32:07,stocks,"I've read that wmt is realigning itself for online shopping. Might explain the high PE, if it starts winning back market share."
2021-05-04 10:32:58,stocks,Yeah I agree. The recent adjustments in her holdings don't bring any confidence either. Too much speculative stocks.
2021-05-04 10:20:22,stocks,Mines fucking $107. I bought right near the top and haven’t been able to average down much. I wonder if I should just sell and reallocate at this point
2021-05-04 10:02:25,stocks,I would say that people are probably rotating out of Apple and into other stocks.
2021-05-04 11:54:09,stocks,Moving into other inflation protected assets like Gold...
2021-05-04 11:34:56,stocks,"Agreed, just gotta be patience and it'll pay off."

2021-05-04 17:05:43,stocks,"Sure I do. What's Tesla's P/e right now?

My point is that there is a lot of value in the future of EVs. The planet depends on their adoption. 

And a whole lot of people are willing to pay for it. 

These companies have a strong foundation in a huge market."
2021-05-04 10:53:18,stocks,"On top of that, people forgot that speculative buying doesn’t always work out. April 2020-Feb 2021 was a year where you could throw a dart at a dartboard of tickers and buy whatever you hit to make money. People weren’t just dipping their toes either with $500, some are going into risk with 20%, 30% of their portfolio. Some even more."
2021-05-04 10:12:35,stocks,"Yeah I consolidated and sold almost of my speculative low cap stocks. Most of my money is now in ETFs and crypto. Individual stocks I hold are aapl, msft, CTXR, agtc, and fb. I do have some money in the arkw and arkf just because I like their holdings"
2021-05-04 10:17:00,stocks,So are you saying I should buy some more PLTR?

2021-05-04 06:48:06,stocks,Guidance from companies like PINS hasn't been great. Personally expect etsy to crush earnings (like amazon did) but give weak guidance about slowing user growth once the pandemic ends - and stock price tanks. Holding 25 shares at $202; and I don't sell at a loss so currently looking like this is gonna be a very long hold. I hope I'm pleasantly surprised.
2021-05-04 06:38:48,stocks,"Sorry misspoke meant overvalued, but that could just be me doom reading"

2021-05-04 16:41:07,stocks,"Can't rule out a deeper dip happening at all though, while I'm leaning toward a 2017 like year and a larger correction next year, one index is really suggesting a 2019-esque repeat right now in the best case scenario where it's going to spend at least a couple more months being stuck in a range (the Dow has mostly been pretty strong all year long outside of the memapalooza stretch but as you can see, I'm still not fully trusting it haha)."
2021-05-04 17:22:41,stocks,"Merely a long time since correction occurred, index went up too fast with no news to justify it. I'm not shorting the market, not hoping for it to fall since I have some money invested. Just holding some cash incase it does correct."
2021-05-04 11:58:47,stocks,Is it a good time to buy now or will it drop even more?
2021-05-04 12:08:40,stocks,Good question.
2021-05-04 12:20:50,stocks,"I think it depends on your country.  In the US, yes."
2021-05-04 12:25:09,stocks,"Like shortyafter said, if US then yeah. Foreign markets are also likely to have commissions. I think Interactive Brokers has the best international fees."
2021-05-04 18:08:49,stocks,"S and P 500, it's an index which tracks the top 500 stocks in the US by size ( I think). This is good advice btw, buy an index ETF and leave it alone. If you want the excitement of trading, start very small $30 ish on something that you like and preferably has seen red. Make some mistakes, read a lot, learn."
2021-05-04 19:16:42,stocks,"Personally, I'm not sure if Doge could possibly keep climbing like this based on the fundamentals around the coin but it's going crazy so I'll not comment on that one. ETH and BTC are certainly good choices right now tho.

RemindMe! 2 weeks"
2021-05-04 19:19:45,stocks,Invest however much you're willing to lose at least half of to be somewhat safe. Once you're in DO NOT touch it for at least a week and see where it goes (if you're buying ETH and MATIC that is). If Doge actually crashes at this point we're going to see a massive pump in other coins soon.
2021-05-04 19:34:50,stocks,Only if you think it would go higher. All depends on what you’re willing to take and how high you think it’ll go
2021-05-04 19:37:01,stocks,Maybe if you see the stock climbing more in the future but I’ve learned to buy and to also sell in increments to decrease the possibility of missing out on more profits or not getting any profits. It decreases risk. Congratulations on the profits.
2021-05-04 07:05:44,stocks,"You're kidding? The Russell 2000 is barely below ATHs, and it's still up by nearly 20% YTD. Truly a brutal beatdown for small cap... When you say 'correct another 10-20%' I guess you mean correct another 2-3%? Yeah, you're right, small cap is getting absolutely demolished right now, it's totally not only the highly speculatively stocks with ridiculous valuations :)"
2021-05-04 15:33:24,stocks,"If you don't believe the demand will increase then don't buy this... Simple as that.

2021-05-04 17:27:32,stocks,That’s my line of thinking as well. Single people have been isolated and have put off dating for a year. Now that everyone’s getting vaccinated the fear of meeting strangers is gone and you no longer have to wear masks on dates anymore (honestly a serious mood killer even if both parties agree to it). Don’t bet against horny people lol

2021-05-04 10:12:56,stocks,Agreed so the price right now is fair. Appl’s p/e is usually between 20-35. Basically the stock is stuck between 117-140 right now barring any shocking news.

2021-05-04 16:49:25,stocks,"I suspect that it being her talking about it is the way to float out the idea of rate hikes to see how the market reacts.

Frankly I don't buy interest rates staying at 0-0.25 for much longer than Q1-Q2 in 2022. But I suspect that they are not going to aggressively hike (I bet the first hike will be 0.25-0.5).

I wish this just didn't get out though, kind of frustrated about today. My suspicion was that the idea of tapering was going to be floated next month at that FOMC or when the fed goes to Camp David and we'd wait until later before interest rate stuff was floated."

I don't think shorting is a bad idea overall, but naked shorting should be punishable by incarceration, no questions asked. Fining them 1k when they earn 100k is peanuts, and the sec will definitely not fine them 50/80% of the profit.

The type of co-mentoring I’m imagining is group exercises to learn investing processes together. For example, there could be an intro to fundamental analysis workshop where each week a cohort of participants pitch a stock they think is undervalued with research as reason. Then their peers can discussion each other’s pick and provide constructive feedback on their evaluation process.

2021-05-04 06:09:35,stocks,"In mid-late February 2020, the market grew increasingly weary with the 'Rona about. I am a rather pessimistic individual, so I already operated under the assumption that a crash would come soon. The only question was when and how bad it would be.

Then came February 24 and 25, Monday and Tuesday. Monday was such a bloodbath that cycle breakers triggered repeatedly. It's one thing for individual stocks or even sectors to trigger a breaker, but this was different. I am in Europe and by the time NYSE opened, we already had been having a complete bloodbath and breaks for almost 6 hours. Pre-market North America was so red, breaks would take place immediately after open.

That was my cue. I was watching it go on for a few hours, then placed stop loss orders on all my non-essential stocks and even sold some on the spot. My stop losses were set so that the following day would allow for about half of the losses from Monday to reoccur in hopes that things would ease up. But Tuesday was like 80-90% as bad as Monday. I was at work and my phone buzzed with notifications. This was sold, that was sold, and that was just Europe. A few hours into NYSE and I was sitting on piles of cash.

At this point, I was hoping things would crash much more.

Not even one month later, I felt like many of my stock interests were severely undervalued without good reason. Not only were they undervalued in my eyes, I also felt that if things didn't improve overall, we would be screwed way harder than with just a simple stock market crash. So I started buying again."

Working in software consulting I was in contact with customers from various sectors constantly, from pharma to construction to software, and they all had the luxury problem of having so many orders that they couldn't follow through. The world was supposed to stand still, but it didn't. It couldn't, or we would all be screwed. That's the realization that grew in me, and with that I was convinced the market oversold. Some companies would even thrive in this environment.

By mid-March, the sell-off had largely slowed down or stopped completely and I was waiting for a sign. As soon as the moving average convergence divergence showed a likely break out on MSFT (probably my highest conviction stock), I started buying more of that and LOGI (another one I always liked; everybody needs equipment to work from home). Both have more than doubled since, and so have other stocks.

Didn't put all my money back in at once of course, but by the first week of April I had reinvested most what I had cashed out earlier."

DRIPped it right into a handful of new shares every month ever since. TSX:PPL also continued paying me monthly.

2021-05-04 00:44:49,stocks,"This was leveraged risk. It wasn't overt, but covert stock buying using open market purchases (plus derivative ""swap product"" offered by the big banks).

 These swaps were kept off Archegos books (so they could manipulate shares in a stealth fashion).  The swaps were ""invisible"" to the investing public.

The stocks were purchased by Credit Swiss, J.P. Morgan, and Goldman Sachs. Next sold back a ""derivative"" swap product to Archegos. This process hide the fact Archegos was pumping the market.

This was fraud. It allowed Archegos to keep buying shares of CBS, Discovery, etc. through the use of derivatives by driving up the price of these shares (because he was the only one buying them in the first place).

It was a classic pump and pump using an exotic financial product. The problem arose  when CBS saw the share prices going up so the decided to ""take advantage"" of the rising stock price by issuing new shares to take in revenue.

This new issuance of shares by CBS devalued the share price. As the shares started to plummet (because of the new issuance of stock) Archegos who was leveraged on both the stock and derivatives ""swaps"" started to be in the red real fast. 

The banks got scared because they were the ones who sold Archegos these swaps to begin with (and in order to cover their pussy asses) they involuntarily started to liquidate Archegos positions.  The banks started to get their nuts squeezed.  So they began dumping CBS and Discovery (without explicit permission)  in order for them not to be crushed by a bad trade.

Simple."
2021-05-04 09:28:19,stocks,"Total return swaps aren't any riskier than the cash-market equivalent to the derivatives position.

When an institution wants to buy a stock, they don't commit the full amount of capital. They finance the purchase of the stock just like how you and I would finance the purchase of a home with a mortgage: they borrow the money, buy the stock, and then put the stock up as collateral to reduce the riskiness of the loan from the lender's perspective so that they can secure a lower interest rate on the loan. That securitized interest rate is known as the repo rate across repo and securities lending markets.

Since the buyer can finance the purchase entirely with borrowed money, the net amount they had to pay today is $0 but they'll have to pay interest in the future. The same exact cash flow structure is reproduced with total return swaps. The buyer will enter into a contract with a bank that's structured so that it's worth zero today. The financing cost that the bank will need to incur to hedge the total return swap on the repo market will be baked into periodic interest payments that the buyer pays every quarter, or at maturity (by raising the strike price of the swap, i.e. the price the buyer would break even at, above the forward price of the stock). Essentially, the bank will just facilitate the ""mortgage"" process for a hedge fund that either wants to stay anonymous or have trouble borrowing the money in exchange for commissions and bid-ask spread.

The reason why Archegos blew up is because (1) they didn't keep enough cash around invested in government bonds to meet margin calls (they essentially didn't make a large enough ""down payment"" on their ""mortgage"" to buffer themselves from going underwater) and (2) they did this on extremely speculative stocks that have already run up 100% in a few months to trigger a short squeeze.

Did I also mention that the cost of financing long positions on hard-to-borrow stocks is actually negative? Because the shares are in so much demand by short-sellers, you will actually get paid interest for lending out the stock you're holding as collateral, which makes it even easier to pay for the cost of leverage."
2021-05-04 00:34:46,stocks,Great videos. Thank you
2021-05-04 06:52:37,stocks,"You are generally correct, except for the fraud part and overall ominous tone.
What happened wasn’t illegal: they got stock on margin, stock price went down, they were margin called and liquidated.

We can compare Archegos to a retail trader with a lot of money:

Since they were investing their own money, and not others, they didn’t have to follow strict rules for disclosure of their investments. Like you don’t have to.

They bought with leverage, which means they didn’t directly own the stock, their bank owned it for them and kept some of their cash as a guarantee. If you buy on margin, you are in the same position.

In Europe retail traders can buy similar products, CFDs, with much higher leverage than Archegos reportedly used. You can easily get an exposition of 10x your cash, sometimes more, while Archegos was 4 or 5x.

The details of the specific financial products that Archegos or you can buy aren’t that important, for practical purposes the differences I’m aware of are:
-	You will get much higher fees being a smaller client
-	The bank will only sell you a much smaller amount of these products (but you can open accounts with multiple banks and buy from each the max amount they will sell you, again like Archegos did!)

I don’t understand why there is so much interest in the specifics of the contracts Archegos used, like they were some mystique special secret deals …

There is probably more arcane complexity and glossed over risks and hidden expenses and conflicts of interest in some of the financial and insurance products that banks create to sell to small investors."

2021-05-04 03:47:19,stocks,Yep. Next question?
2021-05-04 07:57:40,stocks,"Not sure if you are referring to Archegos or their banks.

One reason fo Archegos to not buy stock directly is they wanted leverage.
They had a few billions of cash with which they could buy as much worth of stock. But by using some kind of leveraged contract they could buy multiple times more. Higher potential losses, higher potential gains.

Maybe they wanted the leverage purposely to pump the stock. They did pump the price in practice, buying so much.

Did Archegos want to keep secrecy about its positions? Most likely.

There may be many reasons for secrecy, included in some cases the possibility that the market won’t like what you are doing and lose faith in the stock you are buying, depending from your reputation and position size.
Or preventing your banks to get cold feet upon fully realizing what a high risk client you are.

There is however a much more urgent and understandable reason to keep secrecy if you own a huge leveraged position: if word gets out, some other big player may bet against you and blow you. Think of a short squeeze in reverse.

*If someone knows you bought a lot of Viacom on margin, and that you will get margin called if Viacom drops 20%, and that you own so much that your eventual forced sale will crater the stock, they could take a huge short position with the specific purpose to push the price down and profit from your destruction.*
This is a real killer reason for secrecy. Don’t advertise your exploitable weakness."
2021-05-04 16:04:00,stocks,"You answered your own question because that is what CBS did once they found out what Archegos was up to with his massive derivative position.

It was simple. It was similar to a classic short squeeze in reverse. CBS simply issued a few million shares and forced the banks to cover as millions of shares were ""devalued"" as the share float increased.

This was 2nd grade stuff. It was titanically stupid to pile billions of dollars of leverage on an underlying asset that you do not fully own, or control the future quantify of that asset.

This is why that cherry twit is broke. You learn not to be so stupid during your first year of trading."

The Chinese carmaker's first-quarter profit surged to 237.4 million yuan ($36.6 million) from 112.6 million yuan a year earlier, with earnings per share also rising to 0.08 yuan from 0.02 yuan, according to a bourse filing late Wednesday.

BYD's revenue soared 108.3% year over year to 40.99 billion yuan from 19.68 billion yuan.

The company mainly attributed its strong quarterly performance to a low base after the coronavirus pandemic hammered the auto industry in the year-ago period."
2021-05-04 04:54:28,stocks,"A mixture of people being scared of possible inflation and also an extreme over-evaluation of all sorts of stocks from last year to February. All of them took major hits lately, where investors already valued in their potential and probably an expectationexceeding the ""if all goes super well"" outcome.

Edit: Yup, stock went from Mar 2020 $4.50 to a high of $35 in February. Since then it has been dropping like many stocks that got so overvalued, but still at a more than 340% increase. Of course the chart alone says nothing, but if you go up by 600% in a year, that should be a warning signal right away."
2021-05-04 08:23:50,stocks,"I own shares of BYD. My biggest concern is the lack of information on things that are not in the financial statements. E.g., is there something in the Chinese news that is driving the drop? Did they say something at the conference? I have no idea, and no reliable sources. I believe in the company and its long term potential, but I would be the bag holder if the company committed fraud. Of course, as mentioned, the stocks grew a lot last year, so I am not complaining."

Apparently, [Fidelity's Fully Paid Lending Program ](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/fully-paid-lending) provides you with the opportunity to lend securities in your portfolio and earn income. If there is demand in the securities lending market, generally due to short selling, scarce lending supply, or corporate events, Fidelity may borrow certain eligible securities until either you or Fidelity elect to close the loan.


The biggest so far is that Shares on loan are not covered under Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). However, Fidelity provides collateral at a minimum of 100% of the loan value. In any securities lending transaction, counterparty default is a risk."

One way to check if it'll be worth your while, is to fire up a trade ticket to short your own holdings.  If you don't see a borrow rate charged to short the stock, you won't be earning any interest.  

Also, you cannot (AFAIK) sell covered calls and such with your shares."

2021-05-03 23:24:08,stocks,"My opinion is to simply hang on and let the market play out.  That's what I did during the pandemic crash last year when my portfolio value dropped by 1/3 in 2 weeks.  Had I panicked and sold all of my stocks and gone to cash, I would have been hesitant to buy back in and probably would have missed out on gains.

I definitely had some sleepless nights where all I could think about was how much money I was ""losing"", but I knew eventually things would be back to normal.

By staying in, I was able to take advantage of one of the biggest market winning streaks in years.

That only worked for me because I didn't need the money immediately.  It's my investment for retirement and not for my daily expenses.  If you need that 5k to pay rent or buy groceries or whatever, maybe having it in the market isn't the best bet.

If you have some investments you're not really feeling, then now might be the time to sell them and invest in something else.  I wouldn't sell and go to cash though.

If you're in for the long term, buckle up and just things play out."

I have 10k to invest but I will only invest 5k. The other 5k is to double down on any position that has dipped. 

If the market crashed and your investment dropped 50%, doubling down is best because you can sell on the bounce for a small loss or in some cases a small gain. 

Or covered calls if you're smart with options trading, taking premiums would help to offset your loss.

2021-05-04 08:20:46,stocks,"I actually think this most recent crash was somewhat of a blessing for new investors in terms of education. They got to see the market crash quickly and just as quickly recover, showing them in a short time span what happens in all crashes over typically longer time spans. So now when another crash comes they'll be more likely to hold through it.

Imagine if this crash had taken a few months to a year, and the recovery was like 2008. I bet way fewer of the new investors would have such a strong ""buy the dip, hold the dip"" attitude"

2021-05-04 08:27:49,stocks,"I would advise to start investing by putting money mainly in passively managed ETFs eg ones that follow S&P 500. This is probably one of the safest bets in the stock market. You won't beat the market that way but at least you will not grossly underperform.

Second, play around with a small portion of your available seed money. Invest in stocks you research on your own and try to feel market sentiment. You will most probably lose money at first, but the experience will be valuable.

 For example, you may invest in a stock before it pumping, thus correctly reading market sentiment. But then you may get greedy and not sell resulting in the stock being dumbed and you holding the bag. Or you will take profits and then see it fall. It s best to lose 100 bucks and feel the sting of loss than YOLOing and then never being able to recover."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Why is NVDA worth so much more than AMD? I'm newer to the game so maybe someone can help me with this.  I am sure I am missing something basic but, looking at their revenue, NVDA is not much more than AMD.  NVDA shows $5 billion for quarterly revenue January 21 and AMD is showing $3.44 billion for the same time period. So roughly, 1.5 times as much revenue.

NVDA is shown being valued at $370 billion and AMD at $97 billion.  That means NVDA is worth almost 4 times as much with only 1.5 times the revenue.  Why is this?  

I like AMD and have been invested since March of last year and plan to keep buying more, but I just wonder why they are worth so much less.  Again, I am sure I am missing something very fundamental here so any input is greatly appreciated."
2021-05-03 23:01:40,stocks,"Other can answer with the more intangible items. From a financial perspective, let's take a look at the 10K's of each company (since this is the last filing of NVDA). Over the last fiscal year, here are some key stats:

Revenue:

NVDA: $16.7B / AMD: $9.7B (hrmmm this seems closer than 4x like you mention, more like 1.7x)

Gross Profit:

NVDA: $10.3B / AMD: 4.3B (Interesting, it appears NVDA has better margins so now we are close to 2.5x)

Income Before Taxes:

NVDA: $4.4B / AMD: $1.3B (Now we are all the way up to 3.4x, so getting close to 4x. This shows AMD has lower margins, and higher comparative expenses).

Net Income:

NVDA: $4.3B / AMD:$ 2.5B (Woah we dropped down to 1.72x. If we look, this is due to AMD having carryover losses and Tax carry forwards that reduced AMD's tax burden and net them returns instead of paying taxes hence why they have more net income than they earned).

So what can we conclude on this? Don't just look at revenue. A company can have an insane amount of revenue, but if they are inefficient or have too many operating expenses, they could potentially have  little to no revenue. Next, comparatively, if we ignore the losses and credits AMD took to boost their net income, NVDA is actually coming close to that 4x difference we are seeing in valuation. That and all the intangibles others are mentioning, and AMD's recent pull back, attribute to the difference."
2021-05-04 04:21:22,stocks,"As someone in an industry that largely depends on video cards (game design), I can give a simple answer. NVDA has a relative monopoly on the space, and have been making partnerships to ensure that their cards are a standard for developers. AMD is beating Intel in the processor space, but demands have expanded much more towards the video card sector recently for various reasons, and I sort of feel like Intel is destined to be a Compaq that has been too slow to adapt.

That said, I think AMD can seriously challenge NVDA, but they need a serious focus on that area which is difficult."
2021-05-03 23:07:45,stocks,"AMD has only relatively recently obtained such growth. With regards to personal computing, Intel has led on the central processor front for decades in terms of market share, partnerships with oems, and performance. At the same time, NVIDIA has dominated the consumer/professional/gaming graphics card segment, in terms of market share, technology, and performance. 

After building my AMD based PC in 2019, started really paying attention to parts, and news regarding AMD's products. Wife was convinced to buy in at a measly 30-40 a share, IIRC. And they have since performed beyond expectations. Their consumer products do not quite make the very top in terms of overall performance, but their value proposition in consumer products has yielded high growth in terms of adoption, and they are starting to secure deals with OEMs. 

TL;DR AMD is David vs Goliath on the two most important fronts AMD has. If you can consider them a David lol. But they're accelerating in terms of development and market share. I'm so long on AMD."

2021-05-04 06:48:59,stocks,"My personal opinion is that most analysts and investors aren't that into electronics and tech and dont see the upcoming potential of AMD.
We saw huge impact in the CPU marked with AMDs chiplet technology and following AMDs roadmap its the plan to do the same thing in the GPU market. The upcoming RDNA3 chiplet graphics cards are said to be very, very fast and even much faster what NVidia can offer. There are some very promising leaks and the chiplet designs makes it possible to cut the time to market so AMD could probably be 3-6 monts ahead of Nvidia with even better products in the next GPU cycle.
This leads to better public recognition, probably higher prices and margins and after all higher revenue in graphics segment.

Also AMD is switching to 5nm next year when intel just try to improve its 10nm process. The 6nm APU Rembrandt and the 5nm version 1 year later will surely gain more market share in mobile and OEM market.

For me its most likely that Intel and Nvidia will loose market share to AMD and AMD will increase margins over time.

I think its possible to double the revenue in die upcoming 1.5 years."
2021-05-03 23:27:31,stocks,"Simply said look at their businesses as well. Speculate forward.

What is next for AMD, producing a better chip ? Their stock price rise seems to be more about can Intel shit itself even more.

What is next for Nvidia, artificial intelligence ?

'' On September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Arm Inc. from SoftBank Group Corp. (TSE:9984) for $40 billion.10 Arm is a U.K.-based semiconductor and software design company specializing in CPU architecture. Nvidia says the acquisition will help it to expand its AI capacities and advance a range of technologies from cloud computing and smartphones to self-driving cars and the internet of things (IoT).11 Nvidia noted in its annual FY 2021 filings that the transaction is expected to close some time in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.12 ''

Looks like Nvidia has always been more universal and are pushing for something big, if they succeed that will be quite the money banger.

Which company would people rather buy for next 5 - 20 years ? Will AMD still be producing better chips than their last one ? Is AMD going to be around or are Intel, Apple and Nvidia going to push breakthrough things AMD can't possibly match ? AMD is quite scarier and riskier investment in that regard. Nvidia on the other hand has bigger stronghold with their GPUs and have a lot of speculative things that could pay off big time.

Disclaimer, i own fuck ton of both equally."

Not only does NVDA have more going on right now, they also have a stronger future roadmap for growth."
2021-05-04 00:05:36,stocks,"Both companies are highly overvalued....the question is which one has more future potential/risk?  NVidia GPUs reliably outsell AMD GPUs, but lets call that a wash....AMD CPUs beat intel lately(usually not forever), but have super high margins so not very profitable and both chips are likely to be made obsolete by ARM based CPUs from apple and now Nvidia if they make the ARM acquisition....and that's the big one, if Nvidia gets into the CPU race, offering an Apple M1 like product for windows, that's a big hit to AMD(and intel).  Nvidia network compute growth has almost matched it's graphics in just a couple years, so the hype is strong...AMD is kinda running out of steam after beating Intel down the last few years.  given a long enough time period, both will likely meet their price valuations and even go higher, but in a shorter term they are very risky to any market correction.  I will add, AMD does not have a dividend unlike Nvidia(or Intel) so it's a bit harder to hold for very long periods."

2021-05-04 01:08:58,stocks,I’d say give it a few more years  for them to surpass Nvidia. AMD was always the budget room heater until ryzen and the graphics cards timed with the early ryzen releases were meh. A lot of new architecture they haven’t yet mastered

2021-05-04 08:04:51,stocks,"AMD has serious supply chain issues, since their silicon flies off the shelves faster than TSMC can produce. NVidia has Samsung fabs to help them out. This will hamper growth for at least another two quarters.

Nvidia has huge additional revenue with their quasi monopolistic AI accelerator chips. This revenue is used to pay an army of software engineers, which is the reason that AMDs software is seen as inferior. For a decade they couldn't compete in that space against Intel and NVidia.

That said, I'm [absolutely bullish on AMD](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=AMD). As soon supply chain normalizes, they will have insane revenue numbers. Due to the new revenue they can finally afford to attack Nvidia and Intel on their home turfs, which is software and mobile devices. AMD laptops are the best deal currently, but nearly unavailable in many regions. People take the Intels instead."

[Based on this](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=AMD), they clearly see the market potential, but not in the short term. As long supply chain issues aren't resolved and their 'quality of life' product improvements don't reach the customer for another six month, there is nothing the management can do. If cargo shipping is still restricted, crypto mining buys bulk product at a huge discount, they just have to wait until things normalize. Then there will a explosion of revenue."

There is more demand on CPUs and GPUs today than there ever was in history, and it won't be met for a long, long time despite gradually expanding production capacities. At the moment they are merely able to prioritize product lines that are the most profitable AND still can't produce enough for their products to be actually available at retail.

2021-05-04 17:27:13,stocks,"True but they are pretty shitty with very poor performance...Apple proved with the M1 that an ARM chip can perform as fast if not faster than x86 at much lower wattage for the same performance.  And microsoft hasnt made the transition to ARM as software compatible as Apple has done, alot of apps just dont work on the windows ARM platform.  So couple things would have to happen, someone has to make the hardware(say Nvidia) and Microsoft has to support it as well as Apple has done, so no easy task....easier for Apple to do this as they have control over the entire platform, hardware and software....but if the M1 macs start taking more marketshare from PCs Microsoft will have no choice.  Microsoft themselves drove the ARM platform before but just arent very good at chip design(and likely the tech wasnt just ready yet), Apple with their iphone/ipad are much better at it so it would take someone like Nvidia or Apple to do it right."

AMD is also second banana in M&A, overpaying for XLNX while NVDA is overpaying for ARM, which is a way better thing to overpay for. And NVDA might not have to pay for it, while AMD is hip deep in buyer's remorse."
2021-05-04 15:17:07,stocks,AMD also did the chips for PS4 and XBOX One. Also GPU for Nintendo Wii/ WiiU. So they've been in the game for a long while now (more than 15 years).

2021-05-04 08:08:42,stocks,"Gamedevs are saying, that AMDs software game was upped recently with the new revenue. Having a couple of 100 software engineers sitting around makes a huge difference, but they cost a lot. Supply chain issues for all their chips hamper their possible growth. They could annoy Nvidia in the low end a lot and push for more market share, but the product can't reach the customer. In a year or two, AMD will attack Nvidia, especially in the mass market. Getting CPU and a marketable GPU from one vendor is cheaper for builds and we will see that."
2021-05-04 08:41:11,stocks,"For gaming the Radeon Cards are pretty equivalent to the Nvidia cards, and AMD actually makes the Radeon cards themself, they aren't selling of production rights."
2021-05-04 12:33:53,stocks,"I'm not dismissing them only because of past mistakes. I'm dismissing them because they don't have the current talent to do anything interesting, and at least one of their competitors is rapidly innovating and is poised to own a huge industry (AI) practically by itself.

Their leadership is making iffy moves, buying second-tier earners for first-tier money. There's no clear synergy, unless Lisa Su is thinking of ditching x86 and going with Xilinx's ARM-based SoCs. But that broadly impairs the current assets of AMD. It's a very weird and costly move, at best."

That way, they don't announce earnings when it's crappy like the beginning of May? I feel like all these companies are getting unfairly hit because ""April"" is the month to buy and ""May"" is the month to sell.

The hard reality is that many skilled & unlucky get royally f*cked.  

I'll go back to AMZN for example.  Look at any reputable site/bank collating analyst opinions.  The 'Low' for AMZN is way higher than the current price.  And the 'Low' was also higher than the current price in January (the last earnings).

Many lost their shit on options banking on AMZN breaking $3500 in Jan/Feb/Mar... it's now sub-$3500 in May.  After two stellar reports.  

Yet Goog/Googl is now 30% up in that same time frame.

Options are now the rage for some f*cked up reason... and they shouldn't be as they're tools for seasoned investors.

There stock seems to have shot up just in a year. There is a huge shortage on ammo just from the infrastructure being way behind and with COVID causing supply shortages across multiple industries, I'm thinking this could be a good stock. With that said, I think they are generally known as more of an outdoors company and not so much ammo. Just thought I'd see if anyone had some good takes."

Guns and ammo sales typically do better in the face of fear of the government moving significantly down the gun control path. 

Right now is something different, and 1/6 was a preview. There’s more to it - the firmly conservative Supreme Court and razor majorities in Congress mean sweeping gun control on the level that could meaningfully impact the industry has a near-zero percent chance of taking root. Gun control advocates have already been let down repeatedly in the first 100 days of the new government. 

And in any sort of “hits the fan” scenario, ammo is a more valuable currency than just about anything other than clean water. Doomsday preppers are on a different level right now, and they’re moving in larger packs. 

Ammo sales will continue strong for the near term."

2021-05-04 02:32:51,stocks,"Vista is smashing it.  Last March this thing was a dead horse at 6 bucks then all hell broke loose .

...multiple factors contributed to the greatest run on ammo as long as I have been in the industry ..8 years now. ..national emergency with Covid, Civil Unrest, Police Brutality..looting in Santa Monica, CA of all places, Massive influx of new buyers..the list goes on. 

Obama was no match for this.  

It started March 12th 2020 and has been outrageous sales EVERY SINGLE day 417 days in a row!!!!!. Can't keep anyting in stock. Vista has a massive market share(Federal, Blazer, CCI, Speer, American Eagle and now Remington) This is THE ammo stock. They also hold the keys to primer manufacturing which is the reason we are in this mess. The primer shortage caused a backlog and then 10 million new gun buyers wanted to feed their new toys. 

Super Demand City and no Supply easy math. As far as timing..this thing still has some juice left in it I believe and that's because they've had some price increases and recently stated they are behind a billion dollars in orders.

Price Targets range from 35-49. A consensus buy across the board on most outlets.  I believe all time high was 52 and change..it has a serious shot at beating that.  I have personally spent a year watching and running with this stock.  Seriously hours daily researching this for over a year.

The negative is there is low volume to move this thing. It's insane. It has taken a big jump, but over 14 months.

The earnings probably hit 575 million in this report and might break earnings record. It was at 38 not too long ago.  I've owned this since last March at an average of 7.80. I have taken profits twice so far. I now have stock and 35 dollar calls to hit May 21st which are green and also some 40 dollar hail mary calls as well. Those could be dreamers, but I work in this field and it never ends. Phones ringing off the hook..lines all day long.  I can't and won't give you advice on what to do with your hard earned money, but I do believe this company has a serious positive short term outlook.

Best of luck Champ"

That’s in sharp contrast to places such as Australia, the U.K., and the U.S., where people buy more used cars than new ones. So policymakers, intent on stimulating domestic consumption, want to change that. China is aiming to double the size of its secondhand-car market to about 2 trillion yuan ($306 billion) by 2025. To get there, Beijing has slashed taxes on used-car dealers, in May reducing the levy to 0.5% from 3%—far less than the 17% tax on new vehicles. It’s also making it easier for dealers to trade used cars among themselves by classifying a secondhand vehicle without a license plate as a commodity rather than a personal asset, which simplifies the transaction. “The used-car-trading business is about to enter a brand-new chapter,” says Xiao Zhengsan, secretary general of the China Automobile Dealers Association (CADA). “We will see more positive policies in this area.

As credit continues to rise at unprecedented rates, housing crisis grows, rising military tensions, and historic low birth rates loom that will threaten a weakening slave the Chinese auto market is limited by the growth of the middle class and the infrastructure that continues to move toward investment of public transportation."
2021-05-03 23:14:28,stocks,"Labor force can be replaced by automation as technology advances.  There will always be the service industry for jobs as the Chinese people get richer.  And people will buy cars, if you think public transportation can replace personal vehicles then you have never driven a car."
2021-05-03 23:33:02,stocks,"Automation does nothing but eliminate the need for human labor further lowering the value of the extreme population density. Now you have more impoverished people with less money and nothing to do. Public transportation in cities will replace cars. It’s inevitable specially at the density in Chinese cities. Cars take up too much space, cost too much money, and are unnecessary. Once China has any economic down turn vehicles will be the first to go because it is not a necessity like it is in the US. China is actually adopting European methodologies on travel and transportation which have moved away from personal cars."

I was listening to a podcast the other day and it was brought up that there is a severe shortage of biomanufacturing facilities worldwide, including the US. Does anyone know of any stocks (I'm thinking they will likely be REITs) that own (and rent out)  and/or produce bio manufacturing facilities or equipment? I think this will be a high demand are over the next decade and would like to invest in it, but I'm having a hard time finding a place to invest in it."
2021-05-04 03:33:49,stocks,To be fair this shortage could be eliminated in months by simply reducing the regulatory burden in GMOs. A single change in the legal code in any country on Earth and this whole shortage will be a thing of the past.

It’s in this spirit that we’re excited to announce a new partnership with Discord, the communication service popularized by gamers and used by more than 140 million people every month around the world.

Together, our teams are already hard at work connecting Discord with your social and gaming experience on PlayStation Network. Our goal is to bring the Discord and PlayStation experiences closer together on console and mobile starting early next year, allowing friends, groups, and communities to hang out, have fun, and communicate more easily while playing games together.

To bring these experiences to life for our players, Sony Interactive Entertainment has made a minority investment as part of Discord’s Series H round. From our very first conversation with co-founders Jason Citron and Stan Vishnevskiy, I was inspired by their lifelong love for gaming and our teams’ shared passion to help bring friends and communities together in new ways. Empowering players to create communities and enjoy shared gaming experiences is at the heart of what we do, so we are beyond excited to start this journey with one of the world’s most popular communication services.

It’s always a privilege to work with great partners to bring fresh experiences to our fans, and we’ll have more to share in the coming months. Stay tuned to our channels and @Discord for all the latest updates."

I've been a gamer since the Atari 2600 days, and am not a snob.  I just like good games/systems.  Both PS and XBox have their pros/cons.  And will be competing for many years to come. 

PS is the leader for exclusives... but Xbox for great gaming on a budget.  I have the Series X (basically a $1500 gaming PC in a $499 console) and 2 years worth of GamePass Ultimate that I picked up at ~$7/month on Black-Friday deals that gives access to hundreds of games + online play.  

Both companies have a lot to offer.  And that's good for both gamers & investors."

2021-05-04 15:23:15,stocks,"Oh I thought Discord was talking to many companies, like Epic and Amazon, just Microsoft is what people where saying was the best choice, although Discord was likely to go IPO instead. Which is what they look to be doing."
2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Stop panicking. Come up with a plan. I know some of you are tired of these ""it's ok everything will be ok"" posts, but the daily thread is a mess. Browsing it would make some of you think that the market is down 10%.

If you're looking at your portfolio and it's really doing a number on your stomach, **you need to reevaluate your positions**.

Maybe you took more risk than you wanted to. Maybe you put too much in a risky position. Maybe you bought into the hype. Maybe you thought with your heart and said ""[insert company] will never go away so it must go up!""

Well, you're here now. What's your plan?

**COME UP WITH A PLAN**

Good investors come up with plans. They don't sell on red days or green days. They sell when something happens that changes their initial reasons for buying.

Are you going to hold forever? Are you selling before earnings? Are you selling if it gets to whatever price? Are you going to keep buying? 

You must have a plan. Once you have this plan...

**STICK TO THE PLAN**

Do not deviate. Don't say ""maybe it will come back up"" or ""maybe it will come back down"". Sticking to your plan is crucial. This is how you can manage your risk. It doesn't matter what happens in the next day or week or year. You did what you thought was the best action to take in the moment because you stuck to your plan. In time, you will tweak your plan to maximize your potential and minimize your downside. Don't look back at a position and feel great or bad. Just evaluate whether you made the right decision based on the information you were working with at the time.

**TAKE YOUR EMOTIONS OUT OF THE EQUATION**

Do you think Warren Buffett panics every time there's a red day? Absolutely not. Then why should you? If you let your emotions get the best of you, you WILL do something stupid. The stock market does not care, so why should you?

There are going to be many red days ahead. Are you ready for them?

See you tomorrow!

Edit: a word"

2021-05-03 21:10:47,stocks,"I feel like people panic when they see their stocks drop in price and they have little-to-no understanding on the financials of the businesses they're invested in. They don't know what p/e ratio it historically trades at, no DCF valuation, etc. Even if it's a growth-heavy investment, there isn't a real effort to describe how and to what degree they expect the company to grow. If you have conviction that a company you're invested in is currently undervalued, you shouldn't be alarmed by day-to-day price fluctuations and should buy dips that come along the way.

The other reason I think people panic is if they're investing with money they need in the near future i.e. money they shouldn't be investing with in the first place."

Is this a good plan?

2021-05-04 10:48:46,stocks,"Very good advice. I think the reason there's so much panic right now isn't because it's down a lot, but because it seems to be down for no good reason. Lots of companies have reported earnings, and earnings are mostly up and beating expectations across the board, yet stocks are going down. This doesn't make a lot of sense. Whenever there's a consistent change in the market, people like to look for the reasons why so that they can make decisions based on those reasons rather than let there emotions take over. When they can't find a reason why, emotions take over again, people panic sell, and the market dips further."
2021-05-04 10:56:41,stocks,"ahahha. for once i made the correct guess. when nvda hit 622, i knew it was time to get out. my amzn also went above negative. the last 2 times it did i kept thinking it's time for it to go up so i didn't sell. it stayed negative for the last 6 months. nvda went up and down over and over but i never sold. i probably could've made like 50% on nvda alone if i sold when it hit 540 and bought at 500 every time. 

so finally i said fuck it, i'll learn my lesson this time. when it hit 622 i knew it was already too high. i got out, amzn went up another 4 percent and my stomach churned. finally it's all down now. i hope shit goes down another 10% so i can get back in. for fucking once i'm out before it's red. thank god."

I went from 2% position up to now 5%. I'm down obviously but I've actually added to my position as the price tanked. As the markets go to shit I'm consolidating into my high conviction companies. What I'm not going to do is sell off just because market conditions aren't favorable.

Only problem is the big amount of tech, biotech stocks of which you know they aren't all going to make it.

2021-05-04 11:12:01,stocks,"lol. selling at 10% down is like the perfect place to lose money. that's what happened to me in the august correction. took me 6 months to make it back. if i kept it all, i probably would've been up 5k right now instead of up 1k.

i started out telling myself i'm going long no matter what. then it went down and down and my stomach churned. i eventually gave up at 10%. 

all i can say is pick a stock you know is gonna go up in the long term and stick with it. another strategy i'm using now is to sell when i see it quite high because inevitably there will be a correction. you should trade on a 1 year or longer horizon. if i did, i would be up at least 10k right now. i made a ton of smart plays but chickened out. i bought cvx when it was 80 but i ran when it went down to 70. if i waited 1 year, it would've been up 110 right now and that was only 4 months later. sold qqq too right before it began going up all the way again.

so what is a stock that'll go up in the long term? monopolies with growth potential. an obvious one right now is nvda. in 5 years, is it gonna be higher than it is right now? there is a very high probability it would be."

The stock market is forward looking, and it doesn’t seem like it thinks that earnings are going to look that hot after this one.

When I am in a situation that looks sort of hopeless, the best thing to do is to stop watching the stock. Stop paying attention to it. Forget about it.

Something is overvalued when the market cap and cash flow don’t align or their future cash flow and expected market cap don’t align. It’s that simple.

2021-05-04 12:07:20,stocks,"A typical business valuation using an income approach is performed using a discounted cash flow (DCF) or direct capitalization analysis. Start there. Learn how to appraise business enterprise value. 

At a high level, you’re appraising the present value of future cash streams, including the remainder value of any assets. 

This requires you to review a company’s audited financial statements—not just analyst or commentator opinions regarding a stock. Even if the analyst did a DCF, you need to evaluate the analyst’s inputs (including weighted average cost of capital (and the inputs to building up a WACC) revenue and expenses, growth rate of revenue and expenses, etc.) to determine if you agree they are reasonable, supported assumptions. 

This is why the enthusiasm for companies like Palantir is just that—enthusiasm. People are just barely getting to a full year of audited financial statements, and they can’t compare year-over-year financials."

Youtube has a ton of videos regarding performing a DCF, although I can’t vouch for any in particular. I’ve read older editions of Appraisal of Real Estate in the past (not precisely the same, but commercial real estate is often appraised using an income approach, i.e., DCF).

With the elec vehicle market boom going on over the next ten years. One of the biggest factors will be a charging network. When cars started getting massed produced. It was gas stations that made the difference. Gas stations multiplied and are everywhere. Plenty of car companies have come and gone. 

Gas stations will be on the way down as the electric car revolution comes. Even though there are a few good competitors for charging stations, EVgo is working in the right direction. They are working with car manufacturers and municipalities. Add in the billions they should be getting from Bidens latest approved Infrastructure bill. EVgo is now the leader of what can be a nationwide network of charging stations. They will have the ability to place charging stations anywhere. Malls to private businesses. 

I expect them to be the first to open a version of a gas station. A group of charging stations along highways with a convienience store and maybe a fast food restaurant. Once this starts, they will excel far beyond any competitor. Then become a household name. Then they win. Sort of how you xerox something instead of photostat copy. Or use a Klenex instead of a facial tissue. The brand will end up selling itself.

PWC released an excellent report a few years back detailing the expected economic size of countries by 2030 and 2050. India, China, Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico were some noticeable growers in the top 10 by 2050. Other countries like Vietnam, Philippines, Egypt, and Nigeria were expected to grow very substantially as well.

Do you have any plans or plays to capitalize on new emerging markets in your portfolio?

My most direct plays are Unilever and TLK (Indonesia Telekom). UL has really positioned itself well in Southeast Asia and Latin America, reaping good results from consumers there. It could be a slight edge over their main competitor P&G in the decades to come. 

As for TLK, there is nothing particularly remarkable about it other than its large and established in one of the world’s largest growing economies. It’s solid, stable, and pays a nice dividend. If Indonesia stays stable, it should logically grow with the economy.

These are what I like and are not recommendations. 

Curious to hear your plays. 

As a note, focusing on emerging markets does have risk. Sometimes you are dealing with environments with poor rule of law, corruption or instability. Sometimes currency fluctuations can negatively impact your price. Be smart and be aware of your investing environment."

If you consistently buy a stock when it dips, and then sell it with profit and repeating that with the same stock throughout a steady increase, would you make more than if you just held? Considering each time one buys back in, they are paying a higher price. 

For example, let’s say you kept going in and out of one position as shown—- 

Buy: 100 shares at $10
Sell: 100 shares at $15

Buy: 100 shares at $12 
Sell: 100 shares at $16

Buy: 100 shares at $15
Sell: 100 shares at $20

2021-05-03 21:09:28,stocks,"You can compound your profits by buying more shares at dips, and you can re-evaluate risk at each dip opportunity. Each purchase is independent."

2021-05-03 22:28:29,stocks,In magically fairy land yes. Problem is nobody is actually that good at timing the market. You’d be better off going to a casino and trying to pick the winning slot machine. Time in the market beats timing the market unless you’re quite literally a god.

2021-05-04 05:36:40,stocks,"Better to hold and buy the dips in practice, because when you get out you might not find a decent re-entry point for awhile (if ever). It’s easier to just average down your share price by buying the dips, plus you’re adding to your existing number of shares."
2021-05-04 07:41:25,stocks,"Problem is you can't be 100% sure where the highs and lows will be. If you're trading, each of the timeframes (short/medium/long term) require a different mindset and strategy. Even then, you're working off of probabilities, not definites. Trading isn't for everyone, it's a lot of stress, more stress the shorter the timeframes. Buying and holding long term in a company you believe in will give you a better night's rest at least 😂, trading can however potentially give you exponentially better ROI, but it also works the other way if you mess it up.
As an example, this past month I've managed to just over 2x my account, my bloody trading contact did a 2000%🤦🏻‍♂️(it's real, I saw the account), but that's some aggressive trading and he's really good at scalping the short time frames. I doubt I'll ever in my lifetime be able to do a 2000%. That is not the norm, but I'm saying it just to illustrate it CAN be way more profitable than long term holds, but IT IS more risky too. 

What pisses me off, I see a lot of ads/people pushing trading, but only show the gains, not losses, there's a reason why like 97% of new traders lose money. Risks are high, risk management is so important and its not something people can action properly straight off the bat, you don't always walk away with a win everyday and you need to be able to mentally deal with that without making a losing streak worse and know how to handle that situation. As well as some traders have done this year, it means nothing next year, you can lose your edge in an instant, you just need a few consecutive bad trades and you're done. 

So my advice, if you want to dabble in the trading side, play with a demo account and prove to yourself you can be profitable first. You don't try pilot a jet without getting a licence(training). Even then, portion off a portfolio between investment and trading, make your trading portfolio smaller than your investment portfolio."
2021-05-04 08:56:28,stocks,"What will more likely happen is you:  


Buy 100 stocks at 11$ Sell at 14$  
Buy  Back at 21 Sell at 23$  
Buy Back at 31 Sell at 35$  


What you are descrbing in your post is called swing trading.  


If you held : 100\* (35-11) = 2400$  
If you swing trade: 100\*(3+2+4) = 900$

 Swing trading is a legitimate strategie. But like many others have pointed out, you are likely to miss time the market and miss out on some gains. What I would recommend to you is make two accounts in your tax free saving account; one of them with the strategie to swing trade and the other to keep holding/buying from stable etf. After 3 years, look at the performance of both of them. Then decide if you wanna keep using 2 strategies or if you wanna consolidate to whichever is the better one. Hope this helps"
2021-05-04 13:22:58,stocks,"While I generally agree that timing the market this way successfully isn't really possible, there is a variant that I do that has been working well for me. When I find a stock that I really like, I buy and hold it at a certain percentage of my portfolio (3-5% for most). But if that stock dips 10% without a specific catalyst (e.g. market drops, sector drops, ...), I'll buy more ($500 -$1000 worth) and plan to sell it when the dip reverses and that allows me to make $50 to $100 off dips for stocks that I really believe in and am fine having more of anyway. I do generally only do this for stocks where I've seen a consistent pattern of dips and climbs. As part of this, I always try to free up cash after a good green run so I can buy on the dips."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 3, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 3, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) ticking higher while the tech-Nasdaq (QQQ) declined. The SPY rose 5% in April, for the best performance since November of last year. Following a rotation into cyclical and reopening stocks at the beginning of the year, April saw the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors lead gains in the SPY, returning to the leadership position. Growth stocks continued underperforming, paring recent gains after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said some sectors of the market appeared “frothy”. Looking ahead, market participants continue to monitor corporate earnings and wait for more economic data, particularly the April jobs report that will be released May 7th. 

A wave of stronger-than-expected earnings, especially in banks and mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), have fueled the latest rally in the market. In the US, effective distribution of the vaccine and the gradual reopening of the economy have led to a surge in consumer spending, driving corporate profits way past analyst estimates. As of Friday, 86% of S&P 500 companies had beaten first-quarter earnings expectations, according to FactSet data. This would mark the highest proportion since at least 2008, if the current rate holds through the end of first-quarter earnings season.

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

Last week, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic.. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

**Highlights**

* As of Sunday, more than 104 million Americans were fully vaccinated, [according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations), nearly ⅓ of the entire population.
* Legendary investor Warren Buffet spoke at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting. There were a lot of takeaways, we encourage everyone to check it out.
* Shares of Uber, Lyft and Doordash (DASH) fell sharply after Reuters reported that Labor Secretary Marty Walsh supported reclassifying gig workers as employees.

Recall the battle last year over Proposition 22 in California, which eventually passed in favor of companies in the gig-economy. 
* New York City [Mayor Bill de Blasio said ](https://twitter.com/Morning_Joe/status/1387733678093127684)that NYC would open with full capacity beginning July 1.

* Twitter (TWTR)said on Monday it will introduce a new feature to let users charge admission to their live audio chat rooms in its ""Spaces"" feature, as the social media company seeks to court more content creators. Starting on Monday, any user with at least 600 followers can be a host, the company added.
* Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management bought about 1.3 million shares of Twitter Inc worth $71 million last week after the stock fell on disappointing earnings results compared to peers.

just wondering if anyone can help, or point me in the right direction with the following, I'll keep it brief, but if any info is required, please feel free to ask.  


My Mum has about 40k in her current account, obviously earning nothing and slowly depreciating with inflation - She knows that I have been dabbling in the stock market (small figures, a few hundred here or there - Mostly a ""How does that work?"" sort of thing) and has asked for some advice - However my knowledge, risk appetite and goals are very different to hers.  


In short, her situation is as follows:  


\- House paid off with no mortgage

\- Decent pension, pays all her monthly/annual bills, with enough spare for a couple of holidays a year and is able to save for the less frequent expenses, eg a new car when needed.

\- No debt other than a monthly CC used and paid off monthly

\- Circa 40k sitting the the bank doing nowt

I was wondering if putting it into a well diversified ETF, perhaps with a regular dividend, but the choice out there is rather overwhelming, for reference, this is the sort of thing that's coming up in my searches  


 [JPMorgan BetaBuilders US Equity ETF (BBUS) (usnews.com)](https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/large-blend/jpmorgan-betabuilders-us-equity-etf/bbus)   


Can anyone offer any insight into if this is a good call? or if there's anything else out that that might suit her situation? She's very risk averse but having a chat with her she's ""Willing to lose a small amount to try it out"" Which translated to ""a couple of thousand and I'd want to cash out"""

To clarify, I live on my own at the moment and save quite a lot of my income (€1000 per month , about 50% of my income), which I all invest in the ETF. I am going to buy a house with my significant other which I think will lower my savings to €500 per month tops. I’m planning to move on with investing the same way as I am doing now. Should I change the way I invest now, knowing I will have less to invest in the near future?

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"WELL Health Vs Cloud MD? Which one should I invest in for my Kids? Advice Needed Hello, 

I’m going to have kids in the next 5 years, and I wanted to purchase shares in a company and leave it for a decade and gift it to my child when he/she turns 18. I felt telehealth would boom in the upcoming decade so it’s a great place to find a company of my liking. Problem is, I am torn between two companies. I wanted to ask reddit users your opinion of which one is a better option. 

One was WELL Health (WELL) and the second Cloud MD (DOC) 

**Company Overview: WELL Health Technologies Corp. (TSX : WELL)** 

WELL was recognized as a TSX Venture 50 company in 2018, 2019 and 2020. 

WELL Health Technologies Corp. field is delivering healthcare services. It owns and operates about 2,000 clinics in Canada, reaches over 10,000 physicians and is helping to digitize the process by providing electronic medical records.  

In March 2020, the company launched its telehealth service called “VirtualClinic+”, which is a digital health communication platform connecting physicians with patients through video, audio and text. 

Recently the company launched “apps.health”, which integrates with a clinic’s Electronic Medical Record software. This app helps digital health companies and 3rdd party software devs to collab with the company and push them to adopt it’s products and services

**WELL HEALTH PERFORMANCE**

The company has a current market capitalization of C $1.41 billion. As per the data on TMX, the company’s profit-to-book ratio is 5.429 and the profit-to-cash flow ratio is 28.10. The year-to-date performance of the stock is a gain of around 50%.

**WELL’S** **FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**

Total revenue for the year 2020 ended December 31, 2020, was $50.2 million. Compared to total revenue of $32.8 million for the prior year, an increase of 53% was driven by acquisitions during the past year and the increase in software and telehealth-related revenue. 

WELL achieved Software and Services revenues of $12.3 million for 2020, which was a 393% increase from $2.5million last year. Their profits were $21.2 million, which was a 93% growth based on $11 million last year. WELL had 42.% in their adjusted Gross margin percentage which was 33.% in the previous year. 

**CloudMD Software & Services Inc. (DOC:TSXV)**

CloudMD offers health technology solutions to medical clinics across Canada. They have developed tech to deliver by combining clinics, telemedince and AI

They provide service to over 500 clinics, 4000 licensed practitioners, and 8 million patient charts across Canada and usa.

The company launched CloudMD On Demand, a virtual solution for pharmacies, insurance companies, and employers across Canada to offer their customers easy access to their medical records. 

**DOC'S STOCK INFORMATION**

CloudMD started trading in June 2020. Q4 2020 revenue of $5.8 million; up 138% compared to Q4 2019 and 73% compared to Q3 2020.

The company has a current market capitalization of C$420 million and a profit-to-book ratio of 8.75, with a negative return on equity and assets

**DOC FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**

Q4 2020 revenue was $5.8 million, compared to $2.4 million in Q4 2019. The increase is based on 5 acquisitions completed in the quarter. Without factoring acquisitions the company achieved growth through 

● Due to COVID, the market adopted telehealth services

● New product features.

● Strategic marketing campaigns.

Q4 2020 gross margin was 40%, compared to 44% in Q4 2019. In the current year, the Company placed certain expenses within its income statement to cost of sales, which resulted in an overall decrease in gross margin as compared to Q4 2019. 

Net loss for the Company in Q4 2020 was $5.2 million, compared to $1.5 million in Q4 2019. 

Cloud has $59.7 million in cash. Starting Jan. 1st 2021 they raised another $58.2 million in a bought deal offering in March 2021, which gives a balance around $100 million and above.  

**My own two cents:** 

Based on the above information, WELL does seem to be poised as the better option. On the flip side with Doc trading near $2, I am tempted by the price to throw a few extra dollars for the potential of a faster return. Or should I evenly spread my cash amongst both companies and ride the wave, until I see a definitive winner between the two? 

**Reddit user thoughts?**"
2021-05-04 08:45:05,stocks,u/AardvarkInformal3656 \- What is your reasoning for not choosing WELL? Is there anything specific that stands out to you?
2021-05-04 08:46:33,stocks,"u/Huckleberry_Holliday \- I agree. As a long term hold for future children, an ETF seems a safer route. If an individual wanted to invest and they were in their early 20's and 30's they could get away with investing in individual stocks and the risk that come with it."
2021-05-04 08:47:51,stocks,I dont really have any specific reason. I just think cloudmd has a higher ceiling then well thats why.

I also wanted to start a discussion on your experience with patents especially how they can influence the returns of investors."
2021-05-03 20:32:25,stocks,Interesting topic for someone looking to dig deep into their due diligence. I would think all (good) analysts are aware of IP and when the important patents expire. The analysis could lead to short term drops as well as long term income stability.

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 3 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! This week isn't as spicy as the last, but there's still buckets of money to be made regardless.

&nbsp;

I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HU4RNzdXJezMzMum-byCGXs6OtfjtCwJpsHyNBFlhsc/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- First and foremost, **expect extra volatility this week**. Many of the companies who report this week are *young*, and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their ""true"" values. Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies.

- **Be wary of solar plays**. Enphase got fucking *rocked* last week due to semiconductor shortages plaguing the sector, so such price action may be seen across the other solar stocks as well. That being said, following Enphases drop, many other solar stocks had sympathy drops, so these shortages may be priced in. Regardless, unless you've got some insider news, look to avoid them for now.

- This is kind of a no brainer, but **NKLA puts will print**. First and foremost, the company is a fraud. Second of all, following of ALL of it's earnings reports, NKLA has gone down every single time bar one, where it went up **0%**. You read that right. 0% was the most NKLA has risen following earnings. Sell credit spreads or buy puts. I've got no faith in Trevor Milton.

- **PENN Reports the day before Draftkings**. They usually follow very similar price movement, so you can use this to your advantage. If PENN puts up good numbers and goes up, you can almost guarentee that DKNG will do the same thing the following day when it reports.

- **Beyond Meat MOVES**. Similar to Enphase last week, BYND almost always craters or rockets following an earnings report. Personally, I would avoid this ticker, but the adrenaline junkies are more than welcome to run long strangles if they're within their personal risk tolerance. There's an awesome amount of money to be made here.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin’ companies, theres plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"DD (Coupang - The Korean e-commerce Giant) This post will be about the DD I did on Coupang at the end of March. Although the stock has dropped slightly since then and have mostly been trading sideways, I thought I would share my thoughts about this company before they report earnings on May 12.

 

\- **Coupang** ([Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language): 쿠팡) is a South Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010. It is incorporated in [Delaware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware), [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupang#cite_note-2)

\- Coupang is founded by South Korean businessman Bom Kim who dropped out of Harvard Business School after 6 months.

\- Currently Coupang is the largest e-commerce company in South Korea

&#x200B;

 **Business Model** 

 \- “We are building the future of commerce” -- Coupang S-1

\- A key competitive advantage of Coupang is what they call their ”Rocket Delivery Service”

\- This includes their Dawn and Same-Day Delivery. Arriving before 7am if ordered before midnight or later in the day if ordered in the morning (this makes purchasing perishable items such as produce convenient).

\- They promise next-day or faster delivery on nearly 100 percent of orders.

\- Coupang claims that 70 percent of the South Korean population lives within 7 miles of a Coupon Logistics Center

&#x200B;

 **Opportunity** 

 

**- Korean Attractive Commerce Market**

Korea is the fourth largest economy in Asia. In addition, South Korea has the following key traits:

* High Mobile Penetration
* Retail Competitive Landscape
* Lifestyle

**- Coupang has an extremely integrated model. From the technology to the distribution**

&#x200B;

 **Risk** 

 

* Operation results might fluctuate significantly
* Future growth rate is hard to predict as the company aims to forgo short-term profitability for long-term growth
* If the company loses its senior executive members, it might not be able to fulfill its current vision.
* The company has had multiple years of large losses.

 

**Financials** 

 

* Total Net Revenue: 11.967 billion dollars (2020)
* Cost of sales: 9.98 billion dollars (2020)
* Operating, general, and administrative expenses: 2.51 billion dollars (2020)
* Operating loss: 527 million dollars (2020)
* Cash and Cash equivalents: 1.25 billion dollars (2020)
* Long-Term Debt: 353 million dollars (2020)
* Total Liabilities: 5.67 billion dollars (2020)

 **IPO** 

 

* Coupang went public earlier this month offering 130 million shares at $35 each, giving the company $4.55 billion 
* The stock closed at $49.25 on its first day.
* Coupang closed at $48.75 today (March 30, 2021). \*41.90 at end of April 30th

 **Valuation** 

 

\- 2020 total net revenue was 12 billion, assuming growth of 100 percent, the 2021 total net revenue would be 24 billion.

\- Using a forward P/S ratio of 5, we get the valuation of 120  billion dollars. Divided by 1.54 billion outstanding shares I get a 12-month price target of **77.922  dollars.**

**- This represents a 60 percent increase from the closing share price today.**

&#x200B;

 **Why We Should Invest in Coupang** 

 

* Household name: There are almost nobody in South Korea now who has not heard of Coupang before. Their status in South Korea is similar to that of Amazon in the US.
* Overseas Expansion: Coupang can achieve such a high-level of revenue and revenue growth without even entering foreign markets. Entering other Asian markets could potentially increase revenue by an even larger percentage
* Rapidly decreasing operating losses. While still not profitable, profitability is definitely achievable within a few years.
* Less political uncertainty: With US-China tensions rising, Coupang is a safe alternative for those who want to invest in Asia.

2021-05-04 09:26:36,stocks,Severely overvalued
2021-05-04 00:25:09,stocks,Agreed! They only have something like 4 percent of the Total Addressable Market and they have been showing 70-95 percent year over year quarterly revenue growth for 3 years in a row all without expanding into other countries.
2021-05-04 00:33:47,stocks,I'll start buying around $30
2021-05-04 00:33:56,stocks,"Yea! 
What puzzles me is that analyst reports and some of the comments tend to suggest how overvalued Coupang is and how they aren’t the Amazon of Korea. Amazon is currently valued at 3K but this is only 40+ with so much upside. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
2021-05-04 02:46:31,stocks,The original IPO price is 35 so I would say anything under 40 should be a buy and if it dips to 35 I will be buying more
2021-05-03 21:41:17,stocks,"Singapore has SEA and Japan has Rakuten, those are not easy markets to penetrate. I doubt that Coupang will have much success outside of SK."
2021-05-03 21:43:19,stocks,"I never said those markets are easy, I just said that they are ideal targets. You are complete right. However, South Korea is extremely competitive and Coupang has come out on top there. I am sure they can succeed in other countries if they put in enough effort. Howevee in my DD I specified that my projections are based on domestic growth only. Imo only considering Korean revenue, CPNG can still grow a lot."
2021-05-03 22:13:43,stocks,"Coupang will certainly continue to have success in SK but I doubt that they even understand the Singapore market and culture well enough to make it there (that's another hyper-competitive market by the way). Japan should be easier for them, but the Japanese market is notoriously difficult to penetrate by foreign firms and SK has recently made itself unpopular there with the discussion about ""comfort women"" and the boycotts of Japanese companies related to that etc. That's not the fault of Coupang but such things matter when you want to attract customers in Japan as a SK company."
2021-05-03 22:15:57,stocks,Yep. I think Taiwan might actually be a better opportunity for them.
2021-05-03 22:28:23,stocks,"Yes, Taiwan should be much easier."
2021-05-03 22:29:40,stocks,Agreed. Less competition and Taiwan consumers are familiar with Kroean companies and products too.
2021-05-04 00:00:00,stocks,"APHA & TLRY Holders - Don’t panic! Here's what happens to stocks when mergers close... Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, do you own research. 

**TL;DR – Some brokers are taking their sweet time with these shares. MOST companies are down day after a merger and then rebound in the coming weeks. Sit tight!**

Ok, so we’ve all figured out what happens to our APHA and TLRY shares now that the merger is closed (Right? Right!). If you’re still confused, check out [THIS post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aphria/comments/n3uylv/still_dont_know_what_is_happening_to_your_apha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from earlier. 

Feedback on my prior post is that SOME brokers have changed your position to reflect your TLRY shares (TD Ameritrade for the win) and some have not (get your shit together, RH). Either way, you will get those shares (hopefully) soon and all will be well with the world.

BUT WAIT! TLRY is down $1.20 today… WTF?!? 

A few things to note - There are a lot of market dynamics at play here:

1. There were hedge funds with prior positions that now need to rebalance. 

2. There are people who were only holding on the APHA for the merger and now want to sell.

3. There are ETFs that will likely have some sort of rebalancing.

4. Shorts may be covering on the weakness today.

5. This is a liquidity event – expect volatility.

We can expect a decent amount of choppiness around TLRY the next few days. “But grey\_patagonia\_vest how do you know?!?” Well kids, I did some good old fashion data analysis. 

I pulled a list of all mergers with the following criteria:

1. Both target and acquirer are publicly traded on a North American exchange

2. The deal terms (like APHA/TLRY) were either all stock or at least some cash and some stonks

3. Any mergers with an equity value >$500mm USD (some of the smaller ones can get funky)

I then looked at the performance of the acquirer (like TLRY in this case) – after the deal closed. I started with the stock price of the acquirer 30 trading days before the merger closed, then looked at 7 days before, one day before, one day after, one week after, one month after, three months after, six months after and finally a year after. Here is what I found…. 

Of the 214 deals that fit this criteria… \~56% of acquirer stocks were down the day after a merger closed (as measured from the day before), so TLRY is in good company. Of these 56%, the companies were down an AVERAGE of 3% (TLRY currently down \~6%). Then, of those companies that were down on day one, 19% of them were back up after a week, 38% after a month and 48% after 3M. Those 48% that were up after 3M were up an average of 14% from the day before the merger. If TLRY behaved that way, we’d see TLRY @ $20.90 before long. 

What does this mean for TLRY? It takes some time. This is no guarantee and this definitely isn’t financial advice, but **today’s trading likely isn’t an indicator of future performance.**"

Ideally though, you should probably have a hard, firm rule, to never allocate more than a certain percentage of your account to a single ticker. For example, maybe you have a rule that you're not allowed to have more than 20 percent in any one stock. That'd be 1/5th of your entire account, which is probably not ideal, but it's better than nothing.

There are people that keep buying dips over and over and over again, and the next thing they know, they have 85 percent of their entire account in a stock that's currently experiencing freefall"

Buttt for my strategy I don't like holding positions for too long and CRSR has been sideways for a few months. 

Averaging down + covered calls allows me to lower my cost basis along with increasing my returns in case it runs up. (I believe it will, eventually...)

Rest assured as soon as it does turn the corner I'm unloading all my shares for a better play"

2021-05-03 20:23:05,stocks,"Cathie seems to have a method to her madness.   ARK is trying to invest in the next blockbuster stock.  No fundamentals or valuations, but chasing the next Tesla.  Maybe Cathie is thinking that picking 1-2 blockbusters is better than going after valuations or fundamentals."
2021-05-04 04:50:32,stocks,"Quit buying single stocks or speculative ETFs if you are not the type who can ride it out. Otherwise you are just going to keep selling at loss over and over. Personally I have more than I would like divided across 5 ARK funds, all down 15 percent. But I bought them knowing they were more speculative than VTI or something similar. I do think the market will swing back at least to break even before too long at which point I plan to sell the majority and just buy more VTI.

I am not the patient type either but I think the more you normalize losing money to try to gain it elsewhere the more likely you are to just keep compounding loss."
2021-05-03 21:24:11,stocks,"Don’t sell. Just hold and forget about it. Find more money to invest in other places. I got antsy and sold meaningful amounts of Shopify, square, Tesla, etc. I have since bought them back. My biggest lessons learned have been when to get in and out.

The market isn’t favoring ARKs investments right now. It will cycle back and Cathies funds will have new highs at some point.  No one here knows the future. 

HOLD THE LINE"
2021-05-03 21:35:33,stocks,"I am in a similar position.
I had made a bit on GME but initially got into stocks I believed in. TAN, LIT they all took a major hit in March, rebounded a tad over April and took a hit again.

Also sold and rebought and tried options. 

Now I have mostly Schwab etf and some stocks that I sell CCs in

TAN
CHPT
LAC
PLTR
FSLY (will prob be assigned, have CSP)

It’s a lot of money to have into those stocks (100 shares) but I am going to try and stick it out."
2021-05-03 23:30:59,stocks,"I believe a lot of people have a misplaced sense of safety in ARK funds because they think its inherently safer due to being an etf.

Normally I would agree that diversification is an advantage and provides safety. However, an entire etf carrying risky, speculative growth companies provides little protection in a frothy market with rising inflation. Additionally, I've growth a bit skeptical on their research prowess ever since they pitched their latest bear/bull case on Tesla. A great company mind you, but still completely detached from its earnings."
2021-05-04 00:36:07,stocks,"people are sour on Cathie Wood right now since ARK has done poorly for a few months so keep that in mind. If you do stick with ARKK, expect it to go similarly to how the previous 5 years went: a couple really good/amazing years and a few bad/mediocre ones. I think we can continue to expect that"
2021-05-04 06:35:03,stocks,"Since the correction from mid-Feb, ARKK is down 26%, whereas QQQ has recovered all the way back to that peak. In uncertain times like this, I would prefer VTI, and perhaps QQQ if you want to take a bit more risk. I don't see a clear road ahead for the ARK funds."
2021-05-03 21:10:43,stocks,Have you been following what is going on with gamestop since? I would really appreciate any counter DD on how it can fail. There is a GMEmeltdown sub but its pretty much the same BS the main stream media spews out.
2021-05-04 03:33:46,stocks,ARKK is am illiquid steaming pile of shit that will blow up as soon as they have any serious outflows. Actually look at their holdings at what % of the companies they hold. Even if most of those companies weren’t grossly overvalued they can’t exit any of their positions without tanking them.
2021-05-03 21:44:58,stocks,"Or cars.  Certainly as important and disruptive an industry as there has ever been.  And yet, even if you knew that in advance, good luck picking out the winners...

2021-05-03 21:01:04,stocks,ARKG is a prime candidate for a liquidity crisis if we get a severe market pullback at some point in the future. That fund is primed to blow up.
2021-05-03 21:40:07,stocks,"I’m buckled in and ready to ride, I fully understood that this was a bit of a high risk investment."
2021-05-03 20:58:58,stocks,I will be the naysayer who predicts that ARK Invest will not even exist 10 years from now. It will close shop way before that.
2021-05-03 23:03:42,stocks,I’ve been looking at ALLY lately. I’ve had them on my watchlist for a while and don’t even remember why I tagged them. I was going back through the list and realized the share price has doubled. Pretty much anything looks good over the last 12 months though I guess.
2021-05-04 09:33:06,stocks,I agree with you completely. I’m really optimistic about large and small cap returns the next year or two. I own QQQ as well but I’m not so sure about how it will do short term. Either way I don’t sell once I buy those.
2021-05-03 22:58:22,stocks,No not really. I sold on the way back down and actually unsubscribed from the now cesspool that is r/wsb. I used to really enjoy that sub for the entertainment but now it’s just annoying. Sadly the chaos at the beginning of the year was probably the most entertaining thing during the whole pandemic for me so I’m not mad about the money I lost on the ride. I also learned a bunch about investing and myself so it was kind of a stress test for the future.
2021-05-03 23:16:45,stocks,The crazy thing was I could have made a killing with GME but ultimately I got greedy and ended up getting out as it fell to just above my entry price. All those people with $420.69 limits actually did the best lol
2021-05-04 01:51:17,stocks,I’m down 22% from my ATH in February. Feel like I can’t catch a winning stock for anything right now.  Fortunately I’m still up 70% YOY.
2021-05-03 20:03:14,stocks,"Yeah exactly, I like their analysis of global trends in tech, but think they are betting on the wrong companies. Eg going all in on Tesla for autonomous is just crazy, and of they are so high on deep learning and robotics why not Amazon and Alphabet? (I get it, they are trying to be unconventional,  but I don't see how you can be so high on certain technologies and then just ignore titans who are pioneers in those spaces. Like how do you not buy the most successful AI company in history...)"
2021-05-04 00:43:16,stocks,"Close friends with Bill Hwang, just sayin..."
2021-05-03 20:20:19,stocks,"You don't have to get into a company on the ground floor. Coca cola was 50 years old when Buffet bought a stake and he got 15x out of it. If you bought walmart 10 years after it went public, you'd still 20x your money (approximately, I didn't really look). The point is that you can wait (if your so inclined) for a company to show you its working before you buy in."
2021-05-03 22:36:33,stocks,"They didn't fail. Netscape's IPO in 1995 valued them at $3 Billion. They were bought out by AOL for $10 Billion in 1999. To be fair, their market cap at the end of '95 was around $9-10 Billion, so they didn't exactly do well over those few years, but if you bought at IPO, you came out ahead. Obviously funds work much differently and they may have caused a drag to some degree. But it's not like they went bankrupt."
2021-05-03 20:38:21,stocks,And that's exactly what didn't happen during the dot com crash
2021-05-03 20:17:40,stocks,"Exactly right, unless you're deeply knowledgeable in any emerging tech, you are better off buying the ETF rather than trying to pick winners.  In the above scenario, if you'd have eschewed the ETF and tried to pick winners, you probably would have ended up betting on Netscape, with the result being much worse, all things being equal ;?).

But then a lot of what we do is akin to gambling, and it's hard not to try and pick winners out of the pack, especially when that technology is going to be a world changer, lol.  I did it with Tesla back in 2011, and made some great profits, BUT of course I didn't stick to it, got in and out a couple of times at the wrong point, but overall I'm way ahead.

Of course I'd be a millionaire if I'd just let it ride, lol, woulda, coulda, shoulda ;?D"
2021-05-04 01:26:09,stocks,Twitter has grown a lot in the past 5 years though. The market misjudged it's valuation in 2013 but the stock corrected quickly.
2021-05-03 23:04:49,stocks,"It moved from r/WSB to r/GME then r/superstonk was created then R/ddintogme for only DD. I have learned more about how the market actually works in these last 4 months than the last 5 years. More likely than not, GME is far from over..."
2021-05-03 20:14:39,stocks,good point
2021-05-03 23:16:21,stocks,ARK does hold Amazon and Google.
2021-05-03 23:00:45,stocks,Their high holdings of Tesla is the only reason I invested in ARKK. Imo they will be a leading AI company and I am patiently waiting for them to have an AI demo day.
2021-05-03 20:27:03,stocks,its harder double 2T cap(amazon and alphabet) but its happening
2021-05-04 12:40:17,stocks,"Interesting watch, thanks for sharing. I'm all about index funds as well. I commented originally because your first message seemed to caution away from indexes, so I was just curious what you thought about alternatives.

Point taken about the timing and being in a rush though. I think I could stand to cultivate a little more patience, especially in new markets like EV, renewables, etc etc."
2021-05-04 12:43:50,stocks,"Oh for sure, I'm fully on board with indexes/ETFs. The original comment made it sound like ETFs could be problematic since some of the companies will likely go under (especially in emerging markets). I'm OK with a reduced return if it lowers my risk accordingly. Picking winners is just too much of a shot in the dark."
2021-05-03 23:13:22,stocks,Well the price has gone back up and hovering much higher than I would have thought by now that’s for sure.
2021-05-04 13:40:43,stocks,"It seems like there is something I should clarify, ETFs are not synonymous with index funds. An ETF is just a mutual fund that is traded like a stock, some are actively managed like all the ARK invest ETFs and some are index ETFs like VTI. I'm not sure if this is what you thought but it's a common misconception I see on here a lot, that ETFs and index funds are the same thing, they're not.

I personally *am* anti industry specific ETFs which are almost always actively managed, I am pro index and factor tracking ETFs and funds which are always passively managed and almost never industry specific. So when I said I wouldn't bother and just buy index funds, I meant I wouldn't bother trying to invest specifically in emerging fields at all and just buy total market index funds instead."
2021-05-04 15:10:10,stocks,"Right on, I gotcha. I get that ETFs aren't exactly the same as indexes in the way they're managed. But they are similar in the sense that you're buying into a group of companies hoping to capture gains from that particular sector while decreasing your risk in the event of a downturn, no? Either way, I do agree. The majority of my investments are in a total market fund, but I do play around a little bit, but only with money I'm ok with completely losing"
2021-05-03 21:09:59,stocks,I love reading your DD and I believe that nuclear energy is critical to the future of our society. Any recommendations or posts you’ve made that highlight a good starting point for investing in the sector?
2021-05-03 21:14:31,stocks,Where can I actively check the uranium spot price?
2021-05-03 22:38:24,stocks,So what stocks would you recommend to take advantage of these trends?
2021-05-04 11:20:26,stocks,After some more research I just threw some money into URNM. What would the bear case be for uranium? That the uranium supply will outlast demand even with a decline in production?
2021-05-04 11:37:13,stocks,"Can you recommend any ETFs for UK investors? Amazing write up by the way, I appreciate the effort.

&#x200B;

Also, how long do you see this play? Would you eventually be concerned with nuclear fusion replacing fission? I know its so far away, or potentially not even viable. Do you follow ITER?"
2021-05-03 22:30:18,stocks,Deuterium is also used to power nuclear reactors. Would you expect it to have a similar trajectory?
2021-05-04 03:49:23,stocks,Did this post rise all the uranium stocks +10% yesterday? I can't be just a coincidence.
2021-05-04 19:47:58,stocks,UUUU is down almost 4% today so it looks like a good investment.

2021-05-04 04:12:57,stocks,Best of the best junior imo
2021-05-04 04:14:48,stocks,Glad to hear that. I think that reading through my posts and listening to some Mike Alkin interviews is a great way to get started.
2021-05-04 04:17:14,stocks,UxC or Numerco
2021-05-04 05:03:25,stocks,"URNM as an ETF.

Cameco, Kazatomprom and UPC/YCA as conservative plays.

Denison, Energy Fuels, NexGen and UR-Energy as individual producer/developer options.

2021-05-03 21:41:09,stocks,Op linked an article in the comments that explains how it will play out.
2021-05-03 21:47:21,stocks,"Good question, saw in the article that they have an option in the definitive agreement to accept a better offer and Sprott has right to match. There's a section about cancelling the deal that incurs a price owed to Sprott. Possible downside, but most likely upside."
2021-05-04 04:13:46,stocks,Depends if you want a low risk and more conservative way to play this bull market
2021-05-04 05:01:21,stocks,"I do not, no"
2021-05-04 05:04:42,stocks,"I don't have that kind of influence on the market, it was likely the digestion of the Sprott news over the weekend moving the markets. I just wanted to give this update right before open to prepare for what we saw, so I hope some people acted upon it."
2021-05-03 22:28:23,stocks,"I'll be honest I've been trading low levels of a few single stocks here and there over the past 8 or so years, never EFT's just single stocks but have made some decent side money for the famil mostly tech stocks. Anyway I've never really got into the commodities side of things or oil but I had some free time tonight before bed and love this sub for this reason right here! There are just some high quality cats putting in the time and energy to post awesome things!!  And someday I'll do a deep dive (too many young kids running around the house:)) and give back to this community! 
Anyway I've been pulled in and super intrigued by your write up. Makes me really want to look around in this sector.
So thanks and keep up the wonderful work"

2021-05-03 21:08:39,stocks,"What u/thewildlings said... it’s not really a politics play. I just view that as whip cream on top of the big cake that is S&D.

2021-05-04 06:14:16,stocks,"Not to so many people that aren't following this opaque market and only got the news because of the recent releases of the BTR and it getting traction through Zerohedge, one of the catalysts for the December run as well."
2021-05-03 21:42:29,stocks,"I have no idea what the future will be. If I can make 2 or 3 years worth of returns in a month there's not much thinking involved. And no time risk. Go back 2 or 3 years did any surprises come along that nobody predicted?

Also, I sold all of my long term holds the first of March. I think a long term bear market has started. It's long drawn out top that is hard to recognize. But I might be wrong so I do quick trades so I don't miss out in case it does the opposite of what I think it is doing."
2021-05-04 04:19:00,stocks,I get that. Personally I think we will see a final run up and a correction in Q4 followed by a cyclical shift into commodities and energy related equities after that.
2021-05-03 23:08:24,stocks,In the long term day traders always lose. They may have a good year or two but eventually your luck runs out. You can't compete with the Prop trading companies who have fiber optic cables and custom-made servers connected next to the Wall Street exchange. They're ahead of you in seconds and will close or buy positions before you can even hit enter. Your high speed internet won't matter. You're too far away from the exchange building. In trading the timing matters more than the fundamentals. This is why any decent prop trading companies have offices in NYC. If you want to get into day trading be careful and understand you are competing with companies who have billions to play with and your trading fund is a margin error for them.
2021-05-04 14:59:22,stocks,I am thinking of doing this myself. Do you run the full wheel on your (I assume) 100 shares of Amazon? Or do you only stick to covered calls and roll up when the share price tests your strike?
2021-05-03 20:32:57,stocks,I only sell 1 covered call

2021-05-04 15:38:36,stocks,What happens if the stock price approaches or goes over your CC strike price? Would you roll it or let the shares get called away? I suppose you could always buy them back afterward even if they were called.
2021-05-03 21:11:59,stocks,"$300,000+"
2021-05-04 16:17:24,stocks,I'll let the shares get called and either move on to another stock or run the wheel depending on the situation

2021-05-04 10:26:43,stocks,I wish I had understood that fractional stocks are really only a thing through brokerages. I saw the 0.83 news a lot and assumed I would just have fractional shares of TLRY
2021-05-03 22:20:14,stocks,Maybe you were just rude lol. I called and nicely asked about why it was there and if she could do anything about it and she immediately said she’ll put in the form to remove it
2021-05-03 22:19:38,stocks,Nope took me two seconds
2021-05-03 20:40:10,stocks,Doesn’t matter what it shows in your account it matters what actually happened - so it’ll shake out likely your broker will fix it. Come tax time IRS doesn’t care what your app says. Only unrealized till you sell it I don’t believe stock only consideration in a merger is a taxable event
2021-05-04 10:50:50,stocks,Right - that's why the merger documents and press releases from the company (which have investor FAQs) all confirm and restate that there will be no fractional shares. Just think of it as a $17 lesson in learning how to read primary sources and do you own DD!
2021-05-04 04:39:59,stocks,You would be surprised how often being nice gets you everywhere wand nowhere
2021-05-03 23:12:30,stocks,Thanks! Good to know.
2021-05-04 11:14:23,stocks,"I may be misremembering but I believe my TMUS play sort of went the same at first? I bought them on the rumor of the Sprint acquisition @$77 price point and it kind of muddled around for a bit before getting up to $120-130ish. Markets kind of screwy right now so I'd just hold or buy and be patient. Then again, I have zero right to be making any suggestions, I've just gotten extremely lucky thus far.

Side note: I'm kind of finding myself question how everyone jumps to the ""you should be diversified!"" conclusion...  So you can fall with the whole market? Why not select a few carefully chosen stocks that you know should be up, ride down a little as they fight the market, and hope that people recognize their massive potential on recovery? Seems it would be better to have a select few that should be higher rather than a bunch that are just overvalued with everything else."

GME is in the start of a transformation in an industry that is likely in its infancy. The transformation to e-commerce, PC build, and gaming cafe will rejuvenate this company into a monster. Imagine if they open a streaming platform to compete with Twitch? (People literally pay to watch people play) It would be a direct competitor with brick and mortar such as best buy and e-commerce such as amazon. It Gives them a unique opportunity to capture marketshare that nobody has. On top of that it will have the customer service of Chewy. 

For the bears, remember amazon used to be an e-commerce bookstore.

2021-05-04 04:04:14,stocks,"So did they sell new shares or did they not? I heard they raised equity by selling shares.

If the amount of outstanding shares did not change, maybe the company held some of their own shares and sold them? That is also a dilution, as e.g. dividends paid on those shares would have gone back to the company. Essentially, the other shareholders were indirectly holding more shares before the sale than after.

EDIT: Outstanding common stock definitely changed. This is the prospectus for the share emission: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000119312521105564/d160986d424b5.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000119312521105564/d160986d424b5.htm)

 It says that on Apr 1, GME had 70,031,650 shares of common stock outstanding. And after the offering:

>**Common stock to be outstanding immediately after this offering:**  
>  
>Up to 73,531,650 shares (as more fully described in the notes following this table), assuming sales of 3,500,000 shares of our common stock in this offering. The actual number of shares issued will vary depending on the sales price under this offering.  
 

They did sell 3,500,000, so that is the amount of dilution. Outstanding shares reported by e.g. Yahoo seems not to have been fully updated to reflect that."

2021-05-04 08:51:18,stocks,"Yea I have yet to see an actual gamer that's not bullish on the fundimentals long term because they can see the massive trend coming down the pipes.

I'm not even that old, grew up in the ps2/ps3 generation. Played minecraft, skyrim, gta 5, cod4 when they came out close to a decade ago and see they are still just as, if not more popular now. I even remeber the early early days of roblox and it just blows my mind that it IPO'd a few weeks ago. Saw the rise of touch phones and mobile gaming from the early days on an original iPad as well...

Now nearly all my friends and people my age have adult jobs and kids and cheesy as it sounds gaming is the foundation block of the modern family... Seriously though, kids play minecraft in school and it's just a given that every house has a minecraft realm subscription. As a youth football coach I've seen the general participation and student interest fall of a cliff the past few years and gaming is without a doubt the main conversation topic and leasure activity of choice for kids now and it's not even close.

Most young people's first 'adult job present' is a top notch gaming rig and gaming is by far the easiest way to maintain long distance friendships.

Look at the popularity cycle of most games as well, it's basically pump and dump FOMO mania (among us, fortnite) where the crowd makes the memes and the diehards stick around after. Fortnite and shooters have been the craze the past few months but maybe a generational mmorpg or rts is in the works. The industry is always evolving and never stagnate because games dont need to be perfect or simply have the best graphics to be popular.

2021-05-04 04:53:14,stocks,"hmmm I just think, after my own DD and others they are positioned extremely well and IMO are valued just fine rn, its a short squeeze so its a bit higher but I genuinely don't believe the 150-170USD price is that far fetched for it but thats just my opinion.


I think the executives they got are very talented at what they do, incredibly succesful people that could have gotten jobs at any fortune 500 company if they wanted. I think, RC leading the way for gamestop alone is incredible, but the actual team he has assembled, the money they got from the 3.5m shares, the debt they payed off has them suitedly in a VERY good and unique position.


Its easy to say why something won't work because of X or Y etc. Its harder to argue that it will work because of A, B C because frankly, for GME, because of their history. Its very easy to say it won't work or won't work that well.


I just think thats a shit take, taking historical data from this stock, which was manipulated for years and had an executive team that was destroying it from the inside out with their absolute shit decisions. 


Seeing this new team, all the extra shit they have gotten during this time (THE BEST would easily be a huge fanbase and the constant marketing + the raised money from the 3.5m shares sold).


Seriously they have been in the news for almost 6 months literally constantly. Most companies would kill for that and they are getting it for free while in the middle of transforming the company.


They got to pay off all the shit debts the previous shit team had gotten themselves into, they have an insane fanbase, their CEO actually did VERY well during the pandemic and managed to close a lot of stores and keep costs down, keeping them afloat. That genuinely was a tremendous task and he did very well for that.

[https://investor.gamestop.com/home](https://investor.gamestop.com/home). (That shows the same day debt payoff and expansion I was talking about too.) Combined with the factual data of them increasing their e-commerce platform with CPU accessories showing that they aren't lying about their statements. I also encourage you to read through their SEC filings over the last 6 months. Everything is factual. [https://sec.report/Ticker/GME](https://sec.report/Ticker/GME)

&#x200B;

Now I'm not saying all ATM offerings are good things at all. Most of them are bad. AMC for example. Now this being my opinion, but based on all factual data shown it seemed that they were doing the 100M offering to raise capital to line the exec's pockets prior to going under. AMC would have to perform 4x better than they were pre-pandemic to stay in business let alone be on the correct side of the P&L scale. (fact). I'm not saying there isn't squeeze potential in AMC but disclosure I am not invested in them because they have shown absolutely no effort to transform their business model into a successful one like current thread discussion GME. Not all ATM offerings are bad, but how do you know which ones are good and which ones are bad? You can A. just assume youll be on the correct side since say 90% are bad (percentage just a guess) or B. Look at the facts from the successful ATM offerings and unsuccessful and compare it to the current situation.

I'm wondering what sort of crazy shit they're going to get up to over there, but I think they're going to start cranking some new revenue streams.

My 2 off the board picks for buy and hold for a while/growth companies are: 

$PAR (single solution for integrating restaurant software, hardware, customer loyalty, social, etc.) Negative earnings but 82% institutional investing.

Upstart $UPST - AI lending platform with recent acquisition to move into the auto market. Apparently doing pretty well with the whole lending thing driving down defaults by a big percent vs. traditional lending (relying on credit scores)."

2021-05-04 04:19:24,stocks,"SQs PE is close to 1000. The average market PE is around ~25, I think and used to be at ~15 before Corona. While of course whole sectors might deviate from the average, a whopping PE of 1000 is just an outlier that shouldn't be compared to. Look at other fintechs and their valuations and you'll see that while they might not be cheap, basically every stock will be undervalued compared to SQ. So to make a realistic comparison, use metrics of the sector or at least of more than one stock, that's all I'm saying

Edit: the DVD comparison was just that a comparison with one thing doesn't paint the whole picture"

Here are some interesting statistics for you:

* Morningstar analyzed the performance of the 5,000 biggest U.S. stocks between 1991 and 2000. They found that 42% of those stocks finished in the black, while 36% had losses and another 22% vanished altogether. Some of those vanished companies were acquired and generated a decent result for their shareholders, while others were delisted. In any case, the risk of a bad outcome wasn’t insignificant.
* Similarly, [researchers at JPMorgan](https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-wm-aem/global/pb/en/insights/eye-on-the-market/eotm-the-agony-and-the-ecstasy.pdf) found that between 1980 and 2014, roughly 40% of all stocks in the Russell 3000 Index had suffered a permanent decline of more than 70% from their peak values. The “catastrophic loss” percentage was even higher in volatile industries like technology and biotechnology. The researchers also found that the return on the median stock in the Russell 3000 Index was 54% less than the return on an investment in the index itself."

2021-05-04 08:59:50,stocks,"remember when they raise corporate taxes, companies that don't make money will become more valuable since they won't be paying more in taxes and have tons of R&D tax credits.

Now, there’ll be a person on here who will say “I’m down .05% today” on a bad day and my blood will boil, but then I remember when I almost doubled my money in two weeks with some very well timed tech options. Always cognizant that I could lose 50% of my money and be back to square one with a few really bad weeks for my calls.

It will prob find support between 2.80 and 3.05  I would wait until 2.80 to even consider avg down.

2021-05-04 05:33:26,stocks,My portfolio is not for retirement. Yesterday I posted that young people should take some controlled risk as in small and mid-cap stocks non-OTC  which are less volatile.  If over $10 then hedge funds can buy and possibly ETFs not sure .
2021-05-04 05:39:44,stocks,"You didn't answer my question heavily implies that it hasn't worked out well for you yet. Sorry not trying to be rude, but you dodging the question makes me very skeptical. What is your portfolio for? Hedge funds and ETFs can buy below $10. Look at any 13f document or a small cap ETF."

2021-05-04 11:07:08,stocks,A game with rules that can change and an ever moving target. Taxes pay government spending. National debt is ever increasing. The future is going to be paying more in taxes no matter which bracket we're in. The working population will be able to afford it with higher wages.
2021-05-03 21:10:48,stocks,"You can choose to earn less and be in a lower tax bracket, but you're betting that the government won't increases taxes overall. 

What if in 30 years we have 14 or 16 years of public school and universal health care."
2021-05-03 21:05:34,stocks,"You might be earning less but still paying more.

You also have to consider which way our society is shifting. Is there going to be 14 years of public school, more government health care, UBI?

You might be in a lower tax bracket after you retire, but taxes may be higher because of more government spending."
2021-05-04 01:37:27,stocks,"There is no way to know and its not as if the above two factors would increase taxes either. If kids are in school more, that means parents get to be more productive and will likely make more money thus more tax revenue. Same can be argued with health care. It might actually bring costs down which is not hard to believe given how out of reality costs have become. But who knows?

What if they lower the tax on low earners further and just increase it on high earners like back in the FDR era? What if there is another major recession and they let you withdraw it at a discount or even tax free?

Further, regular income is extremely easy to write off and just gets easier as you age. But again, you never know where politics will go. A roth is more predictable but comes at a cost. For most that cost is $1k to $2k of the initial basis."
2021-05-04 02:18:02,stocks,"You're confused about the additional schooling. Some people want associates degrees to be free. That's schooling for adults, not children.

If everyone has healthcare you assume everyone will be healthier. That's a big IF. You do not consider how inefficient government is at anything and how many more people will be on healthcare.

There's only 1 think you need to predict, is the US debt going to rise faster than the stock market?

Everyone will be paying taxes, will more of the burden be on the rich or the poor? Who knows, but everyone will pay and the cost has only been going up."
2021-05-04 09:30:01,stocks,"Thats a valid perspective. Its certainly the conservative one. But there are others. I know Biden wants to make pre-school free. Thats actually a damn good idea since many modern families need 2 jobs to get ahead.

Associate degrees being free means population intellect generally rises. There are a lot of good programs in those that you cant find in bachelor level universities, especially practical stuff. At least thats how it is here in CA. I am on the fence about it honestly. I wish they would filter money to specific degrees rather than just make it a blanket funding for any degree but thats wishful thinking. Even conservatives havent touched this topic.

I am not sold the free market is better than government at everything. I think there are plenty of exceptions to the rule. Problem with health care is insurance runs up prices without a care about cost because they know they can pass it on to us. This is problematic and creates a cycle of rising cost. The system is not good and there are plenty of countries with good socialized medicine.

At this point I am for trying anything else in terms of healthcare. Literally anything. Ill even take making insurance illegal over what we have. I think many younger folks will agree. My insurance bill is $900/mo right now for me, wife and 3 kids... Though I can afford it, its gotten out of hand and brings us back to why young couples need 2 jobs..."
2021-05-04 10:52:57,stocks,"That healthcare cost is outrageous. Hopefully you're at least well compensated on the other side with wage/benefits.

I am hedged on the retirement tax. My 401k is an IRA and I keep another account as a Roth. Pretty typical setup for some."
2021-05-03 21:11:55,stocks,I'm long a blend of etfs with a 20 year timeline so nothing has changed for me except holding a bit more cash to take advantage of any drops. Haven't stopped my monthly contributions just picked up some side hustles to pool extra off to the side.

2021-05-04 00:50:54,stocks,"The explanation is that analyst price targets and expectations are not the market expectations. 

In the case of Apple and Caterpillar yes they beat analyst expectations. But investors in the broad market had much higher expectations of Apple and CAT than these analysts. In general analysts are usually less bullish than the market-at-large. 

So even though CAT may have beaten analyst expectations, most investors were expecting 3.2 EPS or even more."
2021-05-04 03:40:53,stocks,No dum dum - it means you remain in the market in broadly diversified low cost index funds. Bears are always predicting the next crash is right around the corner and if you listen to them you'd literally never have your money in the market.

2021-05-04 09:13:47,stocks,"Well here’s my thought process. Yeah they may make more on unemployment but unemployment doesn’t last forever nor is it considered guaranteed income, let alone income at all. If you want to finance a house or car, you can’t being on unemployment. You see your dream house or a car you so badly want but you can’t get it. Eventually after all is said and done, what if they can’t get their job back? There’s a huge gap in employment there. Employers will wonder why and will ask questions. 

I don’t know about them but I’m looking at the bigger picture. I have worked so hard for what I have now. I don’t want to risk throwing it all away by not having stable income. This is also why I finally decided to enroll into school after 10 years of saying I never will."
