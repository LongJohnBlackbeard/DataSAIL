Why? In history all the major countries in the world went through their industrialization at different times.

Now, the entire world is making a push for green energy at the same time. And there isnt enough copper to go around.

NOVR has forseen this and had been aquiring royalties on strategic copper mines that will be supplying the forefront of this copper defecit since 2018. Do some DD but i think NOVR is going to be a huge payoff one day and they also said they plan to pay dividends one day."

2021-04-11 18:29:40,stocks,"There is a big difference. You can buy an ETF, do literally nothing, hold it for years, and it will more or less track the index. If you buy, let's say instead of VOO, all 500 stocks that comprise the S&P 500, you are now responsible for managing it. How much of each stock do you hold? Do you hold all stocks in equal amounts, or do you weight them by market cap? What happens when the stocks grow at different rates, and your once balanced portfolio is now out of balance? What happens when companies get dropped from the S&P and new ones are added? Those might seem like easy problems to take care of, but portfolio management is actually a lot of work. When you buy an ETF, that tiny fee you pay takes care of the portfolio management. You also have to consider taxes. If you rebalanace your own portfolio, each sell order is a taxable event. When Vanguard rebalances, the fund pays taxes but you don't."

I do have some positions in the JR-line transit railways, though. They've been hemorrhaging since the pandemic, as have pretty much all public transit and travel companies, but in the long term I think recovery could provide a pretty good return. The question, in my mind, is not about whether they will recover, but how long it will take. If it takes, say, 2 years to return to a historically pessimistic earnings based on the last 5 years of data, assuming the market values it how they typically have in normal conditions you'd probably make 30% return over those 2 years, at least. However, if it takes **5 years** to return to such earnings, or if they never recover, then it's a bust."

Japanese companies are increasingly global, with many only making a minority of their revenues domestically.

In general they are lag behind the rest of the world in tech, and automotives and their gdp has been the same for a more than decade.

I‚Äôm curious though why you‚Äôd like your money in mutual funds? You can find many ETF‚Äôs, both passive and actively managed, that will have the same return with much smaller expense ratios. My advice would be to put your money into 70% US ETF‚Äôs (with breakdowns that give you good exposure to large, med, and small cap companies), 12.5 % non US developed markets ETF‚Äôs, 12.5% into emerging markets ETF‚Äôs , 5% precious metals ETF‚Äôs.

I giggle when I read WSB and the huge gains made by some with their ""outrageous"" option plays. Good for them if it works out, but I only know slow and steady and having a nice and conservatively invested nest egg has given me a lifetime free of financial stress. 

My take on YOLO, live it with purpose and meaning and now to actually answer you question;

Consider moving you account to Vanguard and then dollar averaging into their ETF VIG. You can see VIG's holdings on Vanguard's website and with your Vanguard account you can buy and sell VIG commission free. 

Four decades from now, when you consider retiring, I retired at 58, you'll undoubtedly be able to say, ""I could have done better and I could have done worse, but on a risk adjusted return I did very well.""

2021-04-11 18:37:23,stocks,"There are plenty of mutual funds with low expense ratios. For example, Fidelity‚Äôs total US market mutual fund has a lower expense ratio than Vanguard‚Äôs famous VTI. Schwab is a good company and I don‚Äôt doubt they have quality and ‚Äúcheap‚Äù mutual funds."
2021-04-11 18:47:18,stocks,"it makes me mad that the best and safest brokerages(schwab/fidelity/vanguard/etrade) only allow auto invest with mutual funds

but the risky brokerages m1finance webull and robinhood allow it on stocks/etfs!!!"
2021-04-11 18:49:25,stocks,"Schwab has fractional shares so you could buy, for example, 1/100 of a $100 ETF for $1. I know because I also have a custodial account with schwab."
2021-04-11 17:00:00,stocks,"Ah I see, I would still lean toward buying full shares of ETF‚Äôs personally but I see the attraction to being able to have your money fully invested. Perhaps consider  putting as much into ETF‚Äôs as possible and putting the remainder into a low expense ratio mutual fund. Just keep in mind that mutual funds generally have an investment thesis and because of that the funds tend to sometimes over but many times underperform the market. And if you plan on investing for the long haul finding the lowest expense ratio that matches market return will be the most likely to give you the best return over 20,30,40,50 years."
2021-04-11 18:24:18,stocks,Just so you know etfs you have to buy the full share and mutual funds are bought in dollars
2021-04-11 18:47:06,stocks,"Schwab has some MFs that are very low expense ratios too. Swisx and swppx are both very low cost and are MFs, not etfs so you can buy dollar amounts instead of only full shares"

2021-04-11 16:44:48,stocks,Because the OP asked for growth and your post refers to an ETF with return 100% in 5 years while the momentum had 130%
2021-04-11 16:57:34,stocks,What would your suggestions/ideas be for EU stock/etfs?
2021-04-11 19:50:05,stocks,I think qqqm doesnt have a dividend
2021-04-11 17:55:12,stocks,Why?
2021-04-11 16:56:42,stocks,Depends on how much international diversification the OP wants. VTSAX outperformed MCSI world momentum factor ETF over the past 5 years....17.65% vs 14.12% annualized. The expense ratio for VTSAX is .04 vs .3 for the world momentum ETF. World momentum ETF is far more expensive with lower returns and currency risk.

Start with the company‚Äôs own investor relations site. Look at their most result presentation - obviously management will spin results as positively as they can, however numbers (generally) can‚Äôt lie, so you can see how much revenue/profit/cash on hand they have here

Edit: the latest results presentation is here on their website, read this and see what you think:

They are also in a lot of debt and have no cash reserves."
2021-04-11 16:59:49,stocks,"I guess one other thing to add (in addition to having low cash reserves as the above poster said) is why is management paying such a large dividend, and how does it fit into their long term plans?

Ie if they are paying out almost all their entire free cash or dividends, how do they compare to their competitors? For instance if their competitors are paying much lower dividends but reinvesting that money into expansion/growing the business, they may end up losing market share and thus revenue/profits. And that will have a negative impact on the share price (which may well negate the high dividend).

Of course this in turn is very industry specific. The classic cases are IBM and Nokia, who were both dominant giants in personal computers and mobile phones respectively - but then just sat on their laurels whilst their competitors completely outflanked them over the years.
Having said that, tech is a field which requires huge capital investment for future growth - I‚Äôm guessing in this industry not so much. However that doesn‚Äôt mean that competitors won‚Äôt be putting their money to better use over time"
2021-04-11 15:55:44,stocks,Net Debt 3.1Billion and Net loss of 123Million. Am I reading that correctly?? Because those are some big numbers. I am trying to figure all this out.
2021-04-11 16:13:02,stocks,"Yes that‚Äôs right - although I wouldn‚Äôt focus so much on the $123m net income loss, rather I would look at FCF (free cash flow). You‚Äôll see on slide 46 they reconcile the $122m net loss to the +$500m of free cash they show on slide 22. 

Basically seems like there was an $700m impairment charge (presumably Covid related? Maybe worth reading up on that. If it‚Äôs a one off event though which it seems to be, not something to be concerned with)

Excluding that the business had $850m EBITDA which is a key metric (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization). Basically EBITDA = your profit before you pay interest on your debts and taxes. From that they had to pay $150m to service their $3bn debt and they spent $200m on capital expenditures (ie investing in the business). That leaves the $500m in free cash they have presently.

So in answer to your original question, FCF is what matters here ie the $500m (they show their expected FCF levels over next few years on slide 22). As FCF will be what is needed to support the dividends.

The other aspect is also to get an idea of management‚Äôs strategy - from slide 22 it sounds like they expect free cash to keep going up which is good. But if that changes and they have to make large capital expenditures (ie invest in the business) then that will obviously reduce the proportion of profits available for dividends. Also profits aren‚Äôt guaranteed and could be more or less than management estimates of course.

The management estimates will have been audited by the firm‚Äôs external auditors so management wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to just make them up out of thin air, but equally they could be overly optimistic (can happen frequently if you have incompetent management with a poor track record for example)"
2021-04-11 17:33:26,stocks,"This is good analysis; however, I would be concerned about the debt load as it is 6+ times FCF.  If the market gets squeezed, it may be a challenge to maintain both their dividend and meet their obligations without the need to assume more debt.  Worth keeping on a watch list as we go through the next 2 Qtrs."

2021-04-11 14:43:00,stocks,"Jumping past $15 and going straight to $20 during a trading session would be unusual. So expect it to sell at $15.

However, if it closes at $15 one day, and opens at $20 the next day, then you will sell at the opening price."
2021-04-11 14:42:58,stocks,"It might ‚Äúimmediately‚Äù rise to $20 in overnight trading, for instance, and open in your example at $20. You‚Äôd sell for $20 in this case. I‚Äôve had that happen (multiple separate instances, for instance when stock announces results after hours).

But in general, in normal trading, I suspect it actually ascends up through $15 and you sell at $15 even though within seconds or minutes it continues up to $20 which looks like ‚Äúimmediately‚Äù if you‚Äôre only checking every few minutes."
2021-04-11 14:15:27,stocks,If it didn‚Äôt trade at 15$ at all and then gapped to 20$ it would start to fill at 20$

All of this makes its current p/s ratio of nearly 12 pretty high. It's high at today's prices, and it was even high when it bottomed out recently below 20.

I'm a shareholder (about 0.5% of my portfolio), so I obviously believe there's upside here, but there's no question that it's a gamble that also has plenty of near-term downside risk at its current valuation."
2021-04-11 15:22:31,stocks,"SPACs are usually fairly valued at $10. Usually they pop, then drop before the reverse merger, and then drop even more after.

CHPT already dropped below 20 after merger and earnings. I got some around 23ish. I don't think you'll see this go under 10.

CHPT is most likely to benefit from gov spending. I have made posts about my sentiment on it, but basically one of the old board members is a part of Biden's administration. In addition, they offer level 2, 3, and home charging. I don't believe the gov would buy anything with ad revenue, but I could be wrong. Also, it's unlikely that the gov buys only l3 chargers, as the infrastructure doesn't currently support everyone having l3 stations. Some cars can't even charge at l3. Either way, my guess is when the gov does invest in chargers it'll be a combo of l2 and l3. The companies offering only l3 might be SOL, unless it's an easy pivot.

Most businesses right now only have a couple of EV chargers per lot. Can you imagine how many there will be if most of the cars are EV? CHPT has market dominance and if company decides to add more chargers, and already has some, who do you think they are gonna call? Probably the company that they already have some chargers with. The margins already seem razor thin, so it's unlikely any other company can offer more than what CHPT does. 

I kept telling myself the same thing, the company is overvalued at 30. I waited until after earnings to buy in, since that always seems like a good smack back to reality. It's definitely something to keep on your watchlist. I bought in half of what I am willing to put forth into this company. If it drops below 15, I will cost average down."

2021-04-11 13:59:28,stocks,"They are two different things. 401k is about your income in retirement. Always go for at least the match (free money) and more if your budget can tolerate. There are also tax benefits to the amount you put into the 401k.

When it comes to stock purchase programs that is usually a way to boost your current compensation. Usually you are guaranteed a minimum return like 10% or 15% based on how they are structured. One key factor with stock purchase plans is how is the stock doing relative to the market. If you get it at a 10% discount but for some reason the stock has historically underperformed the market by more than 10% you may want invest elsewhere. The better stock compensation is usually in the form of RSU grants."

2021-04-11 15:57:20,stocks,"everyplace i've ever worked has had a 1:1 match (but there was a cap of like 5%).

at this point, it's a no brainer to max out the match, since it's free money. even at a lesser match, it really would simply come down to when you want to retire. if you plan on doing a ""normal retirement age"" in your 60's, that match is going to grow to well beyond 100% of what you put in. the question marks really only are going to start coming into play if you intend to retire young and would have to take into account the early withdrawal penalties.

spp is going to be something where your view of the company is going to be incredibly relevant. they can give you a 300% match and it wouldn't matter if the share price ends up going to $0.00 because the company went bankrupt."
2021-04-11 16:51:36,stocks,It‚Äôs always worth it
2021-04-11 18:20:44,stocks,Always take the match. Its free money.

It‚Äôs hard to get consistent returns like this in the market on a consistent basis!  Contribute to your company match max and invest any remainder on your own."

Would you buy the stock if you didn‚Äôt work there?  If so then buy it."
2021-04-11 14:40:22,stocks,"Depends on the match. My company matches 75% of the first 4%, then nothing. So I put in 4%. I‚Äôm not going to generate 75% on that 4% if I invest it in stocks. Plus put it in a good fund and you‚Äôll be around 7-10% annually"
2021-04-11 15:03:18,stocks,"I put 10% into my 401k, max out my Roth, and whatever else I can spare goes into my brokerage account.

2021-04-11 13:50:38,stocks,"I‚Äôm doing the 401k without question. Seems too good not to, just curious at what point people turn a match away. I was always told look for dollar for dollar.

In terms of the stock, I think I‚Äôm going for it, just a bit concerned about 3% in making it a heavy piece of my portfolio."
2021-04-11 13:55:15,stocks,That‚Äôs definitely solid. Take all the free money you can from them. Getting a 3% match is pretty good for a 401k match. Especially going by the rule of thumb of saving 15-20% of your income each year for retirement. This puts you at 9% already and then you can put the rest in a traditional or Roth IRA
2021-04-11 16:37:13,stocks,Never had an ESPP that I was required to hold after it was purchased.  If that was the case I would only join of I was bullish on the company
2021-04-11 14:12:37,stocks,">In terms of the stock just a bit concerned about 3% in making it a heavy piece of my portfolio.

Don't understand what you're saying, but 401K is a 30+ year savings account. Take whatever's free, and if you still want to trade use your personal brokerage account. Setup and forget you 401K, and review it once a quarter imo."
2021-04-11 18:14:11,stocks,"Idk why you would ever turn down a 401k match. It‚Äôs free money. Even if the match were 10%, that‚Äôs an instant, guaranteed 10% return. The lowest match I‚Äôve ever seen (besides no match) was 25% and most companies are 50-100%. Obviously a higher match is better but any match is worth maxing out."
2021-04-11 14:33:30,stocks,"There are two pieces. The 401k, which I‚Äôm doing, and a stock purchasing plan. The stock purchasing plan will give me a 25% match as long as I put in 3% of my income."
2021-04-11 18:55:02,stocks,So every dollar you put in there is getting 25% return on day one.  Do it.
2021-04-11 14:49:11,stocks,"Oh I gotcha, just depends on your own personal budget. Do you want to put 3%+ in your own brokerage account, save it entirely, or put it into the employee stock program. Completely depends on the company's performance, and if you want to make it a part of your budget."
2021-04-11 17:39:27,stocks,"On the SPP it really depends on the company, what do their financials look like?  Are they a solid stock that you would buy if you did not work there?

2021-04-11 13:46:31,stocks,"I don't think so. Let's say you have 30K in your account (of your own money) and you buy a stock worth that exact same amount, in that case you have 0. Let's say you sell it that same day regardless the amount your money will be settled in 3 days. Any buy you do within that period of time is with borrowed money (you have a claim on the money you get from that stock sell but that is all, the money is not there yet, no settlement). 

Lets say you use day 1, $25K to buy and you sell it the same day. You will have $5K left to buy with until the funds of day 1 have been settled.

I hedge out a month or more when the VIX is low and calls are cheap.  The past two weeks were a
good example.

But if I'm going to hedge, I also up my risk using inexpensive call with the same expiration.  I look for good technicals on a lagging chart.

2021-04-11 00:00:00,stocks,"Shareholder voting: Where to get independent information and advice (for big companies)? Hello, [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/).

I am trying to be a responsible investor and vote on the issues presented to shareholders for various annual meetings. The problem is that I really don't know how to effectively find information on the people and proposals beyond the recommendation of the board.

For example, Ford ($F) is holding a meeting and presented this proposal, on which the board is recommending a ""no"" vote:

*Relating to Consideration of a Recapitalization Plan to Provide That All of the Company's Outstanding Stock Have One Vote Per Share.*

Is there a place or method that people use to find independent recommendations on shareholder voting? Obviously, this would be mostly for big companies; I don't expect much info on an OTC junior mining venture, etc.

Thanks for any advice! And if I am asking the wrong questions, please feel free to point me in the right direction.

Edit:  I should note that I read through the segment in the annual report that outlined the issues surrounding share voting, but while I understand the facts of it, I am not able to interpret it effectively to know how to vote."

It is about institutional investors getting the most value they possibly can.  If they dump their entire position all in one stroke it's going to take time for the market to buy and absorb all those shares.  During this time word will spread about this kind of large movement, regardless if the player is known or not.  People are going to flock to their brokerages and hit the sell button too.  The glut of shares suddenly available drives the price down, and the original institutional investor hurts his own bottom line.

It's like being at a party down by the lake after-hours, and being the first to realize the police have slipped in and are getting ready to bust people. (The stock value of the party is about to go down and it's time to exit the position)  

You always wanted to be the dude walking quietly away, not making a scene, and grabbing the people who were with you, if you could. (The high point was reached and now you don't want to be caught holding the bag)  

The second someone screamed ""5-0"" things devolved quickly.  People would jam up the only road out.  Lights and sirens would come on.  The jig was up and the citations were about to fly. (Market panic on the stock)

I once spent a very long hour with a buddy of mine and a couple girls treading water on a moonless night when things went sideways at one of these parties.  We had gone skinny dipping and didn't want to get busted. (Long-term investor waiting out the stock crash).  Paid great dividends in the end. (Do I really need to spell this out any further..?)"

2021-04-11 00:00:00,stocks,"A problem with index funds, for new investors. I am new to all of this but I wanted to share my opinion about something that seems controversial.  I'm not sure if it's controversial simply because A. people haven't understood what I'm talking about, B. people are just ignorant, C. both, or D. I'm missing something.  Let me see if I can explain my point properly in this thread and see what I get back.

**In general, dollar cost averaging into index funds is one of the best plays you can make.**  I'm pretty sure we all know this.  No disagreement there on my end.

Time in the market beats timing the market.  Yep, that one checks out, too.

**However**, I think that we're facing an unprecedented time right now when it comes to investing.  A lot of new investors are entering the market, and they're not just putting in $200 every now and then.  No.  A lot of people are going from 0-60 in about 2 seconds.  Why?  A few reasons, I think. Not scientific research and not hard data, but my feel on things:

1. Easy stimulus money.  People not spending as much as they do normally when they could go out pre-corona.
2. The rise of retail investing and commission free trading via Robinhood, etc.
3. The GME and meme stock saga.  People who had never invested before started investing after getting into the market originally via meme stocks.
4. Huge profits being made in last year's (and this year's) bull run.  FOMO.
5. People don't want to hold cash because of inflation fears and trash returns on savings accounts compared to equities or other assets.

All of this means that young people who are sitting on a lot of cash are suddenly dumping a lot of money into the market all at once.  Again, this is not about dollar cost averaging your paycheck over the period of years.  This is about dumping a large percentage of your savings into the market all at more or less the same time.  This is my case, and I don't have the data, but my impression on the ground is that I'm not the only one.  A lot of retailers are getting into the market right now, and they're not getting in small.  Please feel free to corroborate or debunk my observation.

Let's take a hypothetical example of what I mean.  Say a young investor is sitting on savings of about $15,000 that he or she traditionally held in a savings account.  This young investor decides to get into the market in early February after getting their feet wet with GME.

Now, most people would say ""index funds, index funds!""  This is what I came across.  Luckily, I did some thinking for myself.

Imagine if this person dumps $10,000 of their savings (2/3 of their $15,000 total) into SPY.  Could it be a good play?  Yes, it could be.  Historically, would it *always* have been a good play?  No, no it wouldn't have been.  It would not have been a good play in 2000 during the dot com bubble.  It would not have been a good play in 2007.  It would have been a horrible play in a scenario like 1989 Japan.

I know at this point people are going to say ""stop trying to time the market"".  I think this is where people lose me.  I don't recommend timing the market, *per se.*  What I'm recommending is **being fully aware of the risks of betting large sums of your personal savings on the whole market, at one particular point in time.**

This market is weird.  Everybody knows this.  I don't know if I'm bullish or bearish, but I'm definitely cautious.

If you want to dollar cost average your savings into SPY over months and years, I think that's an absolutely wonderful strategy.  I just think noobies should be aware that, hey, maybe dumping 2/3 (or more) of your savings into an index fund all at the same time may not be the smartest play in the world.

What happened was, as a noob, I was reading the same old tired advice: ""index funds, index funds, index funds!""  And I just think there's a very big caveat to that when we're talking about new investors who are not averaging their investment over time, but rather betting large amounts of their savings all at once.

Hope I could explain my concern."
2021-04-11 08:45:49,stocks,Your whole thesis is that lump sum investing can be risky vs dollar cost averaging.  This has nothing to do with index funds.
2021-04-11 07:53:48,stocks,"Studies have shown that historically, 67% of the time lump sum investing is more effective than DCA that same amount over a year. 

However, the variance in outcomes with lump sum are much greater, so it can be much better than DCA, but also much worse if there is a crash.

Having looked at that I just lump summed into an index fund. As a young person I have good risk tolerance due to my large time horizon and objectively, lump sum is more often better.

If you think it will crash in the coming twelve months, then DCA.

From this point I will just DCA my new savings of course."
2021-04-11 10:01:17,stocks,If you‚Äôre a young investor holding for years then who cares about dca? I dumped $40k into ETFs and they‚Äôll be sitting there for the next 20-30 years - if market crashes or goes down then who cares? Will it be higher in 20 years than now? Yes. Do I still get the dividends even if market crashes? Yea I do. You can‚Äôt time the market.

2021-04-11 11:47:21,stocks,"The ‚Äúrisk‚Äù you‚Äôre describing is a psychological one. Data shows that lump sum is better than DCA 2/3 of the time. People have been saying the sp500 has been expensive for years now. No one knows what‚Äôs going to happen next. Just buy VTI instead of VOO, tilt small cap if you want with AVUV, and then just keep buying. Way better than buying individual stocks and trying to apparently time the market that way."

https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/

Recap: Bob buys the day before each massive crash, and only then - still lands on his feet"
2021-04-11 14:45:45,stocks,"You cannot say ‚Äútime in the market beats timing the market‚Äù and then also advocate for DCA. 

DCA trades one risk for another. You‚Äôre trading the risk of investing right before a bear market for the risk of stalling entry into a bull market. NOBODY knows what the market will be like six months from now. The experts are consistently wrong on this. 

What we do know, is that markets go up more then they go down. Thus, lump sum is the best strategy. There‚Äôs countless academic studies confirming this. DCA is one of the biggest myths in investing. The only advantage is emotional, not monetary."
2021-04-11 10:12:47,stocks,"Ok so essentially, the truth is we got no idea WHEN the crash is going to come. Now imagine 2 scenarios, with Joe and bob.


Joe has 60K saved up, that he all invested at the start of the year in VOO. Then he DCA 1K every months into it.


Bob is cautious, and only puts 10K of his saved money at the end of every 6 months.



Now, if Bob is lucky and there is a crash precisely at the end of this year, he is going to look like a genius, but in any other case he will miss out on a lot of profits.


Additionally, if there actually is a big crash soon, Joe's situation isn't as bad as it sounds. He will be able to slowly bring down his average cost down by putting in 1K every months. 


Investing right before the 2008 crash sounds horrible, but if you DCA your paychecks into the index every months after the crash, you will quickly bring down the average and recover much quicker than 5 years.



Also, keep in mind in 95 or so, a lot of bears thought we were in a bubble (no real crash for 15 years), and they waited patiently for a crash. They missed out on some of the best profits ever.


We don't know if we are in 99 or in 95. Heck, its even possible that we are in 88 (covid was our black monday!).


I personally invested my whole savings into the market (about 60K). If it does crash, i am prepared to just keep adding more and more.



The only thing which concerns me is people who are putting 50%+ of their savings in stuff OUTSIDE of index funds. The big issue with something like NIO is that its very risky to DCA into it when it does crash. Why? Because there actually is no guarantee that it does go back up!


Also, speculative ETFs isn't the same as a safe index funds. Putting your all of your savings in ICLN and ARK is also risky imo. I do have positions in them, but only around 8% each :)"
2021-04-11 10:39:21,stocks,"Are you saying people should buy individual stocks rather than an index fund? That would be  even riskier, due to less diversity."
2021-04-11 15:18:56,stocks,"If you have 15k sitting in an account it would be better to lump sum invest it. Lump sum investing often beats out DCA. 


The advice I‚Äôve seen: Lump sum during a up trend; DCA during a down trend."
2021-04-11 15:33:13,stocks,"If unprecedented times mean stocks go up, then the indexes go up.

If you gamble on one stock, like gme, you can win big, real big. Once. If you stop here you've beat the indexes. If you keep trading you can lose it all. Which is why you measure your whole portfolio gains against the index they are in. If your stocks rise 50% but the index rises 50% you might as well not have bothered and saved yourself some nerves.

Index funds are usually measured against actively managed funds. You know, the ones where pros are doing what you're doing, buying and selling and choosing different stocks all the time. On average, these pros at picking stocks don't beat the index, at least after you consider their fees. If you want to invest as a full time job, and are as good as the pros who beat the index, then go ahead, since you won't charge yourself management fees you'll come out ahead.

If you only count on one stock at a time, again, you can win big, or lose big, since you're not very diversified. And the more you do it, the more your actions look like a fund after all after many year timespan, since you accumulate different stocks bought and sold."
2021-04-11 19:37:00,stocks,"I get what you‚Äôre saying and I‚Äôm also starting to engage a similar strategy. However, I think a huge difference of opinions here depends on people‚Äôs current savings and assets. 

If a person has a 6-12 month emergency fund, a paid off car, $20-70,000 parked away in an IRA, etc., it‚Äôll greatly affect how they feel about the details of risk in lump sum vs DCA. At that point, you‚Äôre way less fearful of a crash bc you‚Äôll be fine, so from there it‚Äôd be silly not to throw you money into stuff that historically pays off. 

But If you or I are concerned about losing another 20-50% of our portfolios, it‚Äôs probably because we realized we need more in savings before we start throwing more money around. 

You post builds on a good general point, index funds are lower risk but they aren‚Äôt zero risk. Newer investors have wildly unrealistic expectations and self-assessment of their finances right now. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt have their basic finances in order would probably be better of proceeding slowly at first and skipping the lump sum investment as you say, regardless if the gains may actually be lower or higher."
2021-04-11 07:05:29,stocks,"I agree with your thesis, but originally index funds performed well because a lot of money flow into them passively (via retirement accounts etc). Now, we see the boom because a lot of young retail investors suddenly realized that stock market is where people get rich. Combine this with loose monetary policy and you have booming market. Problem with index funds is that a much larger proportion of young individuals would say its for boomers. A lot of younger investors are more likely to invest into something they love or believe in, let it be tsla/aapl/pltr or even gme. The reason why they like doesnt matter - is it the ceo, the product, the values? Doesnt matter. Maybe once this bull run subsides more of them will enter index positions because many will get burned, probably this will happen once monetary policy changes. Now there is no alternative investment options - bonds are trash, real estate is also booming but short on supply, crypto still speculative for majority who dont get it. I would say this is a strong bull run because of these factors, and likely individual stocks picking will have better potential returns in comparison to history."
2021-04-11 07:11:39,stocks,"I agree, also i think that taking something like the S&P 500 as a proxy for active investing is dangerous as it incorporates a lot of survivorship bias."
2021-04-11 07:12:17,stocks,"I think I'm in a similar boat to you with some major differences

1: UK not US so no stimmy checks

2: Started investing more due to turning 18 than corona (always wanted to), although the extra time probably drove me into making different decisions as I always thought I would just buy an index

3: Got into GME and picking my own stocks early (I.e was picking from the get-go, GME from early December), I made ~500% returns on it, with ~1600% on the last 85 shares I sold. It grew my portfolio my roughly +200% (was ¬£13000, hit ¬£40,000)

I currently have nothing in index funds, with my entire portfolio being a range of around 10 stocks totalling roughly ¬£16,000 and I still hold roughly ¬£24,000 in cash due to my uncertainty about the market rn and wanting to be able to DCA"
2021-04-11 08:49:24,stocks,"Incorrect.  Some defensive stocks will do better than the market in the event of a downturn.

EDIT: Again with downvotes.  It was my understanding that the concept of defensive stocks was well-established.  If that's not the case, please feel free to explain or point me to the data."
2021-04-11 08:04:05,stocks,"Thanks for the data.  That's interesting and makes sense.

I'm not confident enough in the market right now to justify lump summing into an index fund.  Like the example in my post, I don't have all that much cash so I may or may not need to dip into my investments at some point in the short-to-mid term.  Therefore my risk tolerance is low.

EDIT: Why is this downvoted?  I'm genuinely trying to figure out why people react negatively to my analysis.  Unless somebody is able to explain it, I'm beginning to think it's their problem, not mine."
2021-04-11 10:16:39,stocks,"If the market crashes in the next 12 months then it wasn't a great time to buy. If you're confident that won't happen, no problem.  Of course nobody knows, I'm not saying it will, but I'm quite risk averse and this market is weird so I'm erring on the side of caution."
2021-04-11 06:57:08,stocks,"Me too.  I have a target retirement fund (ie, index funds) that I've been making regular contributions to for a few years now.

Index funds did not seem like a good option for this one-time injection."

2021-04-11 07:05:18,stocks,"Very interesting analysis which I appreciate you sharing.  A few things:

1. Although he did well despite his horrible timing, the article mentions that dollar cost averaging would have been much more effective.  They also mention that more diversification would have helped (ie, not 100% in the S+P 500).
2. If he needed to pull any of that money out at any time, those crashes would have really hurt him.
3. In Japan this scenario would have looked quite different.  So nothing is 100%.

But yes, fundamentally the point I'm making is to space it out over time.  And if you're impatient, maybe go for more conservative investments in the meantime.

EDIT: Why downvotes?  I'm trying to understand what I'm missing here, if anything.  It would be great if people could actually respond and not just downvote."

You can diversify in 20-25 stocks of small cap, large cap, international, precious metals, defensive stocks, dividend kings, etc.  Plus a few growth stocks to capture some of the upside.

2021-04-11 11:13:32,stocks,"So what are you trying to do if you don‚Äôt want to use etfs/index funds, lump sum into defensive stocks right now? Because what happens if the market doesn‚Äôt crash for a couple more years? You probably under perform the market with defensive holdings. You get rid of this risk by buying into the market with small amounts over time. And, DCAing avoids putting all your money in at potential peaks.

Also, you shouldn‚Äôt be investing if you don‚Äôt have what you would consider to be enough savings (or dipping into those savings to invest), which you mentioned in another comment. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs great about DCAing if you don‚Äôt have a lot of cash available, you work and earn money and put what‚Äôs leftover into the stock market."
2021-04-11 10:59:06,stocks,"Because it's not a question of right/wrong. Lump summing will have a higher expected return at a cost of greater risk. DCA will reduce risk at the cost of lowering expected return. These are personal risk preferences. Young people will be investing their savings for the next 30+ years, so their strategy in the long run will look like DCA even if they lump sum all their current savings into the market right now."

I‚Äôm not confident that crash won‚Äôt happen - quite the opposite, I‚Äôm confident it will happen some time in the future. I‚Äôm also confident 20 years from now this crash won‚Äôt make any difference."

2021-04-11 15:28:23,stocks,"Yeah but you have no idea if it‚Äôll be worse. That‚Äôs the point I‚Äôm trying to get across. Stuff can continue to be overvalued for a long time, so if you DCA and it keeps going up, you just lost out. DCA doesn‚Äôt actually lessen risk it gives the illusion of doing so. The market will always be uncertain so it‚Äôs more so trying to control the psychological problems around investing in it."
2021-04-11 08:58:00,stocks,"Those are interesting takeaways from this article, haha. 

The article makes the point that even in your highly unrealistic scenario‚Äîthat someone invests once, right before a crash‚Äîthey still are okay. The takeaway should be that the chances of you or anyone else falling into this scenario are very unlikely, and even in that unlikely scenario, you shouldn‚Äôt panic. 

Yes, you can add any number of additional hypotheticals‚Äîwhat if the person was actually a space alien, and his space currency got devalued at the worst time!‚Äîbut then you‚Äôre kind of loading the hypothetical story with as many negatives as you can to prove your point. 

Yes, diversify. One etf probably isn‚Äôt enough diversification. But no one is really arguing that it is. The argument is that sitting out the market or trying to time it is futile."
2021-04-11 10:49:31,stocks,"I see your point about buying defensive stocks, but stocks that do better in a bear market also tend to underperform in a bull market. Volatility is lower in both directions. Your advice may be useful for someone in retirement or close to retirement, but for a young person, there is no need to be so cautious."

2021-04-11 11:18:03,stocks,"I lump summed into a combination of defensive stocks and growth stocks, but mostly defensive.  50% of my portfolio is already in index funds that I've been DCAing in over a period of a few years.

I'm aware that I will probably underperform the market if things go smoothly.  I'm OK with that.

The reason I'm lump summing right now is because there's no reason not to miss out on gains, especially when cash and bonds are such trash right now.

I have more than enough cash savings for the next 1-3 years. I'm sitting on a lot of money right now thanks to stimulus as well as a gift from my dad, and I wanted to put some of that money in the market. I just don't really know where my life's going to go from here, and it'd be nice not to lose it in the market in case I end up needing it.

It's just my preference.  It's not better or worse.  Just what makes sense for me.

2021-04-11 11:06:54,stocks,"You're right, it's not a question of right / wrong.  Historically speaking, lump summing is better.  This is why I was speaking about my preferences and risk tolerance.  I appreciate the explanation, but as I was talking about my preference, I'm still not clear on why I've been downvoted.

Also take into account that some young people may in fact have *lower* risk tolerance in the case of job instability, uncertainty about their future, etc.  I have my savings and emergency fund, but it's nice to know I have an additional cushion of relatively safe equities.  Because of uncertainty about my future, in the short-term, my risk tolerance is low."
2021-04-11 10:24:07,stocks,"In Japan, for example, it was not just a blip on the graph.  Stocks do not necessarily always go up.

Am I confident that we will go into a Japan scenario?  Absolutely not.  But it's possible.

I'm just encouraging people to think critically about what they're doing.  It sounds like you know what you're talking about, so more power to you!  However, one should know that looking backwards at the chart isn't always an indication of how it's going to look going forward.  It very well might, but it's not a guarantee."
2021-04-11 14:54:17,stocks,"Yes.  I think people who have been investing for years really misunderstand what it means to invest a large portion of one's savings into an uncertain market.

Best of luck to you!"
2021-04-11 15:48:28,stocks,"My understanding is that via DCA you may miss out on upswing but also on downswing.  Thus, less risk, and it depends on each investor's risk tolerance.

If your risk tolerance can handle it, and you're confident in the market, by all means.  I'm not.  Others may have their own opinion and financial needs, etc.

There are other investment strategies besides index funds and/or lump sums which can minimize risk."
2021-04-11 11:11:46,stocks,"I see your point as well.  But take into account that for a lot of young people, like me, our futures are uncertain.

FWIW, I invest in both index funds (for my long-term horizon) and defensive stocks for that ""just in case"" buffer.

The issue I'm seeing is we have people who are advocating for index funds who have been DCAing in them for 5, 10, 15, or even 20 years.  Of course index funds look amazing from that POV.

Lump sums are never the best idea.  And if that's the route new retail investors want to go, maybe they'd be best to play it a bit more conservatively.  Or not.  But I am taking a conservative approach, because I can't really afford to lose much of what I'm putting in.  Others may have different needs, that's fine."

If I had gotten in at 26, I wouldn't have made this post.  I got in at 35 or so.  I looked at that and said, ""Hmm, realistically how much more growth can we have?""

I didn't sit it out completely.  I also didn't go all-in on index funds.  I went for a middle ground approach which will do reasonably well in all sorts of climates.  This is also reflective of my risk tolerance, which is low, because I don't have a lot of income.

I'm just saying there's a middle ground.  Between ""index funds always win, you can't time the market!"" and ""omg crash imminent!"" there must be a middle ground.  I respect anyone's decision to play it either way, depending on their read of the situation and financial needs.  For me, I wasn't comfortable going all in on index funds in February 2021.

Doesn't mean it's not effective or that one shouldn't ever engage in it. 

I have 50% in index funds that I've been DCAing in for a few years now.  I have total market exposure there.  The lump sum investment I made in February is the other 50%. It's mostly defensive stocks (consumer staples), with some precious metal mining stocks and also big name, reliable growth stocks (AAPL and MSFT).  I also have international and small cap exposure.

I have some tech exposure as I said, but I purposely did not go full tech in February because the valuations, at a glance, just looked insane. A pullback happened immediately after.  I understand that valuations don't always lead to corrections, but I think one should consider how much room a stock really has to run.  Not that I'm suddenly stock Nostradamus, lol, but it looks like I made the right call there.

I've heard stuff like this from tons of people I know and I don't know how to react, I just keep my money in. Almost any basic investing guide says that timing the market is hard and generally the market goes up, so I just follow the basics. I'm not laughing at you or any of your points, I was literally laughing at the number of times I've personally heard the shiller index brought up as a point to not invest over the past few years-- no beginner could have that same experience.

> but people still laugh at me because I decided to play it defensive

I'm not laughing at you for playing defensive. I'm a proponent of holding more cash than most people recommend. I'm not laughing at you at all! I do think there are some mistakes you made in your post:

Your title is ""A problem with index funds"" when you're actually talking about A) DCA vs lump sum and B) predicting an incoming bear market.

1. Lump sum vs DCA is a pretty common discussion
2. Bear market predictions are everywhere, you'll see them at least weekly as you continue to invest in the market

So when you say stuff like:

> You can to some extent. You can look at valuations. Look at shiller P/E ratios. The economy is running hot right now.

I was literally trying to point you to past threads so you can see for yourself that bear market predictions using your indicators have been consistent over the past few years-- does that change your hypothesis? Why is it different now than it was 2 years ago and 7 years ago?

Again I apologize, not trying to be a douche and was trying to have a discussion about your points."
2021-04-11 15:01:34,stocks,"Sure.  But it's the same with index funds.  You can do research on the economy, historical stock valuations, what an index fund does, what the Fed is doing, etc. 

I think a lot of people just buy index funds because that's what everyone says to do.  You shouldn't buy TSLA without looking at the fundamentals.  Well the same with SPY, imo, especially if we're talking about a large portion of your savings.

I think a lot of people are going blind, and index funds are historically great so they might get lucky.  But going blind is never a good idea!"

Yeah.  I appreciate the insight.  I looked at the chart, as a complete noob, in Feburary 2021 and said ""be careful"".  Maybe I should have done more research, but I'm learning.

> Lump sum vs DCA is a pretty common discussion

Fair point.

> Bear market predictions are everywhere, you'll see them at least weekly as you continue to invest in the market

Yes, I do know enough to realize that this is the case.

> I was literally trying to point you to past threads so you can see for yourself that bear market predictions using your indicators have been consistent over the past few years-- does that change your hypothesis? Why is it different now than it was 2 years ago and 7 years ago?

This does change my hypothesis to some extent, yes.  I would like to do more research on the topic, because I think it's reasonable to say that April 2020 was a better entry point than in April 2021, right?  Then again, hindsight is 2020.  So you're right, then.  I concede.  

There's just one thing though, and I think it's where a lot of people are missing me.   Apart from worrying about whether or not it's a good time to invest, ""it's always a good time"", ""don't time the market"" etc... one thing remains:  I don't have that much money overall.  But I am sitting on a good bit of extra money thanks to stimulus and also a recent gift from my dad, plus lower consumption due to covid.  

Cash is not looking good right now.  I've actually got about 12 months+ in cash in spite of that.  But I'm young and my future is uncertain.  I don't know about my job stability.  I don't know if I'll be buying a house.  I don't know if I'll be getting married.  I don't know if I want to buy a car in a few years.  All of these things are possible, but no timeline on them.

I guess some people might say ""well you should make a plan"".  And I have one, it's just not ""let me buy a car at X moment down the line"".  My plan is: let's hold a bit of cash, put the rest in safe equities, and see what happens.

I have a tier 1 emergency fund in cash.  I have a tier 2 emergency fund in savings bonds.   You could say that my defensive equities are my tier 3.

It was just a big fear of mine to invest 2/3 of my savings in an index fund only to have it hammered a month later.  I'm not cool with that.  So I decided to take a more conservative approach.  I understand that I will miss out on some upside, but that's fine.  I just don't want to lose much of what I have.  

The broader point which I'm trying to make is that there are alternatives to index funds.  It's not always THE way.  It depends on your needs.

Does that make sense?

I wish someone would have just taken the time to have a discussion about it rather than assume.  So thank you!

And no worries, it was my bad for taking it personally!"

Yep great sentence haha. But yeah overall if you're a long term investor the markets [will go up](https://www.morningstar.com/features/what-prior-market-crashes-can-teach-us-in-2020/chart-growth-of-1-dollar-headline-3x-106e17d32465fecbc901f2eba32e5cf3.png).

> I have a tier 1 emergency fund in cash. I have a tier 2 emergency fund in savings bonds. You could say that my defensive equities are my tier 3.

I guess this seems like you have more than your emergency fund covered. Imo the general consensus is that you should have ~6mo expenses saved for your [emergency fund](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-much-cash-should-i-keep-bank.asp#about-that-emergency-fund).

After that, honestly have you read into the [Boglehead philosophy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/about/sidebar) at all? They are one of the more conservative investing philosophies on Reddit and often will see portfolio allocations of 60% domestic, 20% intl, 20% bonds. I personally have less bond exposure, but Bogle himself suggests:

> roughly your age in bonds; for instance, if you are 45, 45% of your portfolio should be in high-quality bonds... but clearly ... must be adjusted to reflect an investor's objectives, risk tolerance, and overall financial position

-

> I understand that I will miss out on some upside, but that's fine. I just don't want to lose much of what I have.

Yes your portfolio is yours, and your risk tolerance is yours as well. As often mentioned in stock advice, do whatever helps you sleep at night. But the numbers and logic do, imo, point to a risk tolerance closer to what Bogle and other experts suggest so I do think most people should listen to that advice.

> The broader point which I'm trying to make is that there are alternatives to index funds. It's not always THE way. It depends on your needs.

I think I kinda get your point, but also kinda don't. Yes if you are trying to keep your money from devaluing maybe there are some defensive stocks and bonds to buy to help you sleep at night. But cash is kinda the default and I don't think it's terrible if you're too conservative to put it in the market. And if you are investing or trying to grow wealth, I cannot think of a safer, lower effort way atm that has higher returns than index funds.

I guess overall if I had to summarize it seems like you just have a lower risk tolerance for investing, regardless of incoming bear markets. That's totally cool and there are tons of strategies (DCA, defensive stocks, bonds, cash etc) to mitigate that. But there is a recommended risk tolerance for whatever age you are, and imo the consensus really is that lump-summing into index funds honestly are the best way to be exposed to higher risk. I'd be super curious to hear arguments on if the latter isn't true-- the Boglehead way has really changed my mentality on investing haha.

Cheers and good luck to you! Thanks again for doing the 180 and being open to discussion!"

It's good to put it out there and see how it holds up.  And me too!

> Yep great sentence haha. But yeah overall if you're a long term investor the markets will go up.

I always mention the case of Japan.  Is the US Japan?  No.  But I think people should be aware that, hey, there's always *some* level of risk.  Not sure if you would agree.  

I question sometimes if people on here really know what they're talking about, or if they just look at a chart and go ""stonks go up"".  I get a feeling it's both.  My degree is in economics, FWIW.  

I see some of my stuff get downvoted and attacked sometimes, so it's good for me to put it out there and see if I'm being dumb, if they're being dumb, or if it's just a difference of opinion.

Yes, I know about Bogleheads.  Another thing is that I enjoy picking stocks, lol.  I've done sufficient research, I think, and I think my portfolio is solid although maybe the most sensible thing to do would have been to just follow Mr. Bogle's advice.  FWIW, 50% of my portfolio is in a Vanguard target retirement fund.  The new 50% is kind of for me to play around with (hopefully in a way that doesn't screw me).

I dunno.  I see your point as well but only I know my situation.  IMO I was holding too much cash given the current state of the market.

And you know what, I'll be honest.  I'm kind of a bear.  There!  I said it.  lol.  Could I be wrong?  Absolutely!  But hey, my money, my life.  If I miss out, I miss out.  Let's see.

I buy this and have no argument against it.  

In sum: call me crazy, but I'm taking my own approach to things. FWIW, I think you would agree that what I'm saying is not totally off-base, right?  Just not exactly how you would do it.  And you probably think I'm being a bit silly about certain aspects.  This is what I gather from your response.

All of that's fine.  I feel like this is the approach that is the right one for me at the moment.  Nobody knows my life like I know it.  Perhaps I would be wise to listen to Mr. Bogle and other people more.  I do take their expertise into account.  But I'm still learning what's the line between just doing what others have tested, and testing things out for myself and learning the old-fashioned way: trial and error.

FWIW, I'm quite happy with what I'm doing.  Not everyone will agree.  I wish they weren't hostile about it, but such is life.

- Pricing data - Bloomberg gives data on pretty much every publicly traded security in the world. Most retail investors don‚Äôt know this but the bond market is actually much much larger than the equities/stock market - and for many bonds you can‚Äôt simply google it to get the price.

- Integrates seamlessly with excel, can be used to dump out historical prices/data to plot in excel

- Real time news updates - you‚Äôll get alerts if there‚Äôs critical news/market updates. This is less useful as tbh since the internet any retail investor can get almost real time updates by just following CNBC etc. Still useful though

The data we used from some other cheap website was wrong and messed our formulas. There were some employed people who manually inserted some values in some excels tables based on the formulas... And the numbers did not matched Bloomberg. We hired our math guy, a financial expert to check which data is wrong and only Bloomberg had correct reliable data for all the tickers.
We tried and build an A. I. to tell you when to sell.
For example we trained it to look over earthquakes and how those impact the market and politic stuff. It was a big deal.
The client was just one lady, incredible rich, who wanted an app just for herself. She paid millions for our team to develop it (developer salaries which were not cheap).
So yea, bbg is probably overpriced but because others are not reliable enough they can ask whatever the price they want. Information is the most expensive stuff this era.

This allows for much faster and in depth DD instead of wasting time trying to find information. 

This cost is offset because our program has millions of dollars invested in the market so a 5% investment on making our valuations better is worth it. As an individual with even 100k to invest, probably better off with putting in the extra work."
2021-04-11 16:29:53,stocks,It‚Äôs because the hundreds of tools and insane amounts of data not only save time (which can be extremely expensive) but can sometimes create value. If a trader had to find store and analyze all of the data they used on the terminal they would have no time to do anything else.

It had little label captions for ship name, size, what it was carrying.. path it traveled and what AND WHEN it arrived at port.

I think a lot of dealers and asset managers prefer sending OTC trade confirms over Bloomberg because it's so ubiquitous.

It isn't nearly as useful for getting market data for assets that trade on a central limit order book, although Bloomberg is convenient because it can show all the market data from all exchanges (and maybe trades executed on dark pools?) in a single page and also processes reference data from textual reports published by corporations. Instant Bloomberg is also valuable for getting color. And I think portfolio managers find it convenient to use Bloomberg to aggregate prices, like in S&P 500 heatmaps, so that they only need to ask the hedge fund's software engineers to write visualization tools that can't be viewed in Bloomberg."

2021-04-11 16:58:18,stocks,"At the risk of sounding facetious, it‚Äôll entirely depend on the firm, the contract, the FUM (Funds under Management) and whether it is a good year or not.

Some firms pay more than others - and Portfolio Manager can mean a lot of different things. My last place, it would either mean a discretionary manager (lots of private wealth clients whom they make decisions on behalf of), or it might refer to one of our asset managers (everyone in Wealth Management goes for vertical integration nowadays - so even if you ain‚Äôt got big bucks, we want your money but we will put it in a fund).

In terms of contract, you can be employed by the firm and draw part salary, part bonus (based on FUM performance, etc) or self-employed. That‚Äôs where we white-label your business essentially and you pay lower costs and ‚Äòeat what you kill‚Äô a bit more. My last place also had different remuneration schemes for all kinds of things - being a wealth manager is only partly about investments, also about relationship-building with clients, etc. if we feed you a client received through our website we expect a bigger cut of the pie compared to if you are self-employed and pull them in yourself. Going back to vertical integration, we also want to be sticking tax advisers and suchlike in your client meetings so we want that cut too - or if we send you that client who came in for tax advice, we want that cut again. 

In terms of FUM and whether it was a good year, we had some guys who took 30k a quarter in salary and 100k annual in bonuses for small portfolios. Usually it‚Äôs more but I rarely saw over 1m in a single year. Comparing that to departmental budgets - we would spend about 40% on IT, 40% on staff and 20% on premises, marketing, etc. the IMs took about 75-90% of that spend on staff.

Edit: the Firm I was describing was a UK Wealth Management company, circa 20bn in FUM."

* every week there‚Äôs something else that will be a catalyst for the MOASS

Given the above, if it‚Äôs true, why is the stock going down? I mean, 665,000% gains from one stock? A $1,000,000 **floor**? How on earth is every share not in such high demand that the price is mooning?

Hell, guaranteed 665,000% gains? Yeah who wouldn‚Äôt dump everything they‚Äôve got into that??

You don‚Äôt find that curious, even a little bit?

I mean, GME closed at what, $150? And the DD claims the **floor** is literally a 665,000% gain from here. So where‚Äôs the disconnect here?

If you see an 'F' at the end of a ticker such as HITIF or CRLBF, most of time it is a 'F'oreign company (non US).  Be careful as many of these have extra transactions fees, even on commission free brokers.

Dividends forces you to pay taxes now while capital gains you can defer the tax and even avoid it if your income is below 80k married during retirement.

2021-04-11 00:00:00,stocks,"The Economy is not the Market, or why the S&P 500 could easily NOT hit 10,000 before the end of the decade Recently there have been a lot of arguments to the effect that ""US companies will keep doing great the next decade and so stocks will do great as well."" Over the long-run (several decades), this is certainly true: stocks represent ownership in a company, and as the earnings of the company increase so will its stock price. However, in the short-run (a decade or less) the performance of a stock is also driven by *investor valuation and confidence*, measured by the price-to-earnings ratio. It is perfectly possible for a company to increase its earnings, but for its stock to move sideways or even drop if investor enthusiasm for the stock falls.

For example, from 2000 to 2010 the [US real GDP](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1) grew from $12.9 trillion to $15.4 trillion, even after taking the hit from the recession in 2008. However, over that same time period the S&P 500 index [dropped](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-historical-prices/table/by-year) 300 points from 1,425 to 1,123. What on earth happened? The problem was investor confidence and P/E was at an all time high in 2000 at the top of the dot-com bubble, which then plummeted after the bubble burst, and then plummeted again during the global financial crisis. Even though the US economy did well that decade, the S&P 500 did not.

Of course, I cannot predict the future, but investors should be prepared if history repeats itself the next decade. The current S&P 500 [Cyclically Adjusted P/E ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) (CAPE) is at an almost record high of 37. Assuming a historically consistent growth rate of 10% over the next decade, the S&P 500 will more than double in value. However, if over that decade the CAPE falls to a more realistic historical average of 16, then *all those gains will be wiped out*. It is very possible for the US economy to do great the next decade, but for the S&P 500 to move sideways.

In light of this possibility, what is an investor to do? Oddly enough, my advice is the same as the exuberant post that prompted this reply, but for a different reason. Existing investors at the start of 2000 went nowhere over the next decade, but they performed marvelously the decade after when the S&P more than tripled to its current valuation of over 4000. In fact, 2000 to 2010 was a great decade to invest in the stock market, since you spent 10 long years buying great US companies at a bargain price. If the stock market drops again in the future, you should ride it out and keep investing into index funds or solid companies that will weather the storm and recover once investor confidence increases again."

Or it won't hit 10,000 decade.

Got it. üòé"
2021-04-11 10:58:12,stocks,"There's a couple problems here.

First the reason why the s&p was down between those 2 periods is because you chose a year that was part of the financial crisis. Its using an outlier to compare. 2008 financial crisis wiped alot off of the markets as well as the average american wealth.

If you had your money in the s&p vs real estate during that period your investment in the s&p would have recovered much quicker. So its not exactly fair to take these years out of context without comparing it to the entire asset classes you can choose to invest in.

Second, you are assuming the s&p keeps the same companies in the index over a 10 year period.. this is not true. It re-balances 4 times a year getting rid of poor performers and adding new companies that are growing. 

If the index only keeps companies that are growing and removing poor performers than it remains to be seen that vs any other investment its a pretty damn good choice.

In the short term you are right there can be times where the markets are tanking but you need to compare that with other asset classes to see if its outperforming them. In the long run there's no better place to park your money than index funds following the broader markets."

I think index funds are great *if you've been dollar cost averaging, or plan to, over the course of several years and decades.*

However, I think there's a lot of young noobies (like me) who are just now getting in the market.  And many of us want to get in NOW, which is understandable.  Instead of sitting on a massive savings account, we're finally putting that money to work.  So we're putting a lot of money into a weird, unstable market that is coming off one of the biggest bull runs of all time.

What could go wrong?

Well, exactly what you said.  If we had done this in 2000, during the dot com bubble, after 10 years we would still be down.  The same thing could happen now.  I'm not necessarily a perma bear, but I think everyone has to realize that it's always a possibility.  If you had invested in Japan in 1989, you still wouldn't have recouped your investment to this very day, over 30 years later.

I just encourage everyone, especially new guys, to be smart.  And your post is a perfect illustration way.  New money + inexperienced young people + huge euphoria after 2020 + uncertain market = recipe for disaster.

This is not something that typically happens, but I think it's something that's happening more now as there's a lot of easy money floating around and a lot of noobs getting into the market what with Robinhood, the GME saga, etc.

I am one of these people.  Everyone was saying ""index funds are the way to go"", and I think there's wisdom in that. But I think one has to be aware of the fact that, hey, sometimes dumping all your cash into an index fund can backfire.  I don't know if the market is going to correct right now, but I like the prospect of dumping everything into SPY in April 2020 a lot more than I would in April 2021.

2021-04-11 00:00:00,stocks,"Picking losers- Holding a broad market index fund, then shorting a handful of individual members - thoughts on this strategy? A few relevant points I've been mulling over:

1. It seems easier to identify really shitty companies than to identify winners.
2. When holding a broad market index fund, the worst performing members tend to do *really* badly. For example, in Q3 2020, when SPY rose by almost 9%, the lowest performing decile of SPY dropped by 16.65% on a cap-weighted basis and 17.75% on a equal-weighted basis.

So here is a strategy I thought of: holding most of your portfolio in a broad market index fund as the Bogleheads suggest, but then *picking losers* to take out short positions on with, say, 10-20%, to open short positions on a handful of losers, with the sizes of the short positions being in proportion to their relative size in the index.

Mind you, that doesn't necessarily means straight up short-selling commons. It could mean puts, or any short delta options strategy.

You still have to pick stocks, but you don't have to pick *winners*, which all the responsible financial advice seems to tell us is difficult to impossible. You only have to pick losers. If you can even pick one loser, while putting the rest of your portfolio in the index fund, you'll have alpha over the index fund.

My questions are:

1. What are the flaws in this strategy? I imagine this will depend specifically on what kind of short positions you open. Please don't tell me ""you could pick wrong"" unless your argument is ""you will never pick better than chance,"" which doesn't seem likely to me, but feel free to argue otherwise.
2. Is there already a name for this strategy?"

2021-04-11 00:37:56,stocks,"The ""infinite loss potential"" totally depends on the way you short. It's true of short selling, but not, for example, buying puts. Even if you sell naked calls, because you indirectly own stock via the index fund, you'll still be protected. It will just require more work on your part, e.g. calculating the number of contracts you sell as (percentage of the underlying in the index fund X the amount of shares of the index fund you own)/100, and then if you get assigned selling enough of the index fund to purchase the stock for sale to the options exerciser.

I suppose in a raging bull market where truly *every* stock goes up this wouldn't work, but the losses wouldn't be terrific if you size positions appropriately."

>You sell a naked call option betting against 100 shares at $10 a share, now each share is worth $1000, you have lost $100,000.

No, because the underlying going up necessarily means the index also goes up in proportion. Of course if every single other element of the index shits the bed while this one underlying skyrockets, you're in trouble. But that's not a remotely likely scenario in any sufficiently broad index.

In my personal opinion, I would say that in 10+ years trading, market analysis has actually gotten worse. Not so much with the quality, but quantity. People keep saying the same things over and over again. Since way more people trade now than back then, there's way more scams.

2021-04-11 00:00:00,stocks,"CRISPR patenting question I'm a little flummoxed by the legal side of the CRISPR battle at present so I'm hoping someone on here can shed some light on the situation.

My understanding is that the legal battle for the patent is based on a scientific disagreement over who ""invented"" the use of CRISPR-CAS9 technology for humans. One side demonstrated it's use first in other types of cells, while the other took the logical next step in pushing the tech forward. When I read up on the patent however, it appears to be granting rights to the use of CRISPR on any eukaryotic cell, so I'm really unsure as to why this patent is currently owned by Broad and not the original research team.

In addition to this, since it's looking like Broad (and hence $EDIT) is coming out on top, what are the implications of this for agricultural uses of the technology? As far as I'm aware, EDIT is primarily investing in pharmaceutical based research, but a patent for all eukaryotic usage extends far beyond that. Are they likely to be a solid investment from the agricultural side simply because of the royalties? Or should I be looking elsewhere for more agricultural specific tickers if this is my main interest."
2021-04-11 04:20:51,stocks,"In time I think there will be an investment from the agricultural side me thinks. Irrc not to long ago - maybe last weekend? Crispr was discussed, and in one of the comments a guy said the patent legal battle could drag out. I can't remember who he thought would win, but one of the 3 companies had in his opinion a dream team - but he had money in all 3 companies as it was to close to call.

He also said that a woman? That used to be involved in one of the companies have started her own, and she has filed for the crispr patent to be used in the argiculter. Her company is still private.

So try see if you can find that post there was some good insides in the comments  


Edit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgutkl/civilization\_changing\_technology\_crispr/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mgutkl/civilization_changing_technology_crispr/)"
2021-04-11 04:39:38,stocks,"They're fighting over who provably did what first.  There was a ruling a few years ago that was supposed to resolve this, I had no idea it was still a question until this weekend.

> Two years ago, the outcome of the first of these interferences seemingly resolved the question, albeit imperfectly: the PTAB decided that the Broad Institute and their collaborators had the rights to eukaryotic CRISPR applications and that rights to CRISPR more generally were owned by the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Vienna and Emmanuelle Charpentier as an individual.

[source](https://endpts.com/the-continuing-crispr-patent-saga/)

They made the distinction for the purposes of settling the dispute, but they failed to take into account one scenario.  If you wanted to use CRISPR in non-eukaryotic cells, you only had to get a patent license from CVC.  However, if you wanted to use CRISPR in a eukaryotic cell, you had to get licenses from both CVC and the Broad, which is a pita.

In other words, you only need one patent license (from CVC) if you want to use CRISPR in bacteria, archaea, viruses, and any other non-eukaryotic cell type.  You need two patent licenses (one from CVC, the other from the Broad) if you want to modify plants, animals, fungi, and pretty much anything else worth modifying.  

Get a license from the Broad if you want to edit anything that can actually generate revenue. 

Get a license from the CVC if you want to edit anything at all.  

So you're required to get two licenses, basically.

> since it's looking like Broad (and hence $EDIT) is coming out on top, what are the implications of this for agricultural uses of the technology?

Those two aren't really related.  Whichever group owns this patent is going to license it to anyone that can use it effectively and responsibly, regardless of if the owner is a pharma group or not.  Agriculture is going to be their second largest patent license revenue stream after pharma itself.

> I'm really unsure as to why this patent is currently owned by Broad and not the original research team.

That's what they're trying to figure out :)"

Well a study was just published last week showing no off targets after the base edit and furthermore, no damage to surrounding skeletal and muscular tissue.

As for VTI, my opinion is that it should be a staple of one‚Äôs portfolio and should be a major holding. As all things genomics, everything is speculative right now. But the pay off could very well be worth it.

With investing, it doesn't really matter what you use.   You're coming up with a strategy, doing a lot of research, and in the end buying a ETF or Stock fairly rairly in the grand scheme of things.    Investing is generally the 'slow and sure wins the race' method.   Most investors actually end up with a broad-market index such as VT or VTI+VXUS or similar as most of their holdings, and then pretty much just buy more of it as time goes on.    Note that this is probably the best strategy if you're looking for long-term returns.

Trading is more like gambling.   I.E. playing poker.   If you're really good you can win, but most people suck at it.   You're picking stocks, trying to buy low, sell high, pick another stock and do the same.   Eventually a lot of traders end up day-trading which basically means buy and sell stocks multiple times a day.   Note that this is a high risk direction and there is a good chance that you'll lose all your money.   

If you're a Trader, you want TD Ameritrade and to use the Think or Swim platform, most likely on the PC, but on mobile it's also acceptable.

If you're an investor, it really doesn't matter what brokerage you use, but Vanguard, Schwab, and Fidelity are good choices.   I could make a strong case for each one.  

I personally have a Vanguard account for my retirement accounts as I like vanguard funds for this type of investing, and if you're going to buy a company's mutual funds you should probably do it at the company since it typically costs less that way.  

 I have a Schwab account for my normal investing activities, mainly because their investor checking account refunds ATM fees worldwide and so I opened an investor checking account long ago before I needed the brokerage account, and when I started investing that's what I used.  Their trading platform is ok, but if you're an investor it actually works really well.

I have a TD Ameritrade account which is the only one I have margin enabled on, and I have enough assets invested in the account so I can day-trade on occasion.   If it's clear that a market segment is moving strongly one way or the other on a given day, I'll occasionally buy something like TQQQ in the morning and sell it in the afternoon.  Note that I consider this gambling so I don't do this with funds I need for the future.

I haven't spent a lot of time with Fidelity, but I like their fractional ETF purchase options, which I wish schwab has.  I think their zero fee mutual funds aren't as good as the vanguard ones which cost a little more but I feel are worth it.     Others really like Fidelity."

If you check RSI on most tech stocks, AAPL, FB, ADBE, (I know everyone hates Cramer but FAANG), they all follow the same chart. They get overbought for a certain period then come near oversold, all at the same times. From what we've seen the past few years in the RSI, it seems that we are halfway through an overbought period, nice for short term gains. It's actually laughable how similar all these companies charts are, but some of them are breaking out before others, like FB, AMZN, GOOGL are pretty much confirmed already, I'm hopping on some other tech for short term.

2021-04-11 00:00:00,stocks,"Smart home appliances going to head of class This article mentions the evolving role $JD is playing in the supply chain Source: 
http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202104/07/WS606d1384a31024ad0bab3ef7.html

China's home appliance market is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels this year as high-end and smart products grow in popularity, according to a report from the China Center for Information Industry Development, a Beijing-based think tank.

The report showed that the retail sales in China's household appliance market reached 833.3 billion yuan (127.4 billion) in 2020, marking a year-on-year decline of 6.5 percent.

But such figures still showcased strong resilience amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the report said. Affected by the contagion, the first quarter of 2020 saw large-scale contraction with a year-on-year decrease of 35.8 percent in sales of home appliances, but then performance gradually improved. In the fourth quarter, online and offline markets fully recovered, and retail sales reached the highest annual level at 294.1 billion yuan.

It is also worth noting that last year, e-commerce channels accounted for more than 50 percent of retail sales of home appliances for the first time in China. In 2020, online retail sales of home appliances stood at 419.9 billion yuan, marking a year-on-year increase of 14.48 percent and an increase of 3 percentage points over the previous year. By comparison, retail sales of home appliances via offline channels were 413.4 billion yuanÔºça year-on-year decrease of 21.13 percent.

Rupert Hoogewerf, chairman and chief researcher of Hurun Report, said earlier that 5G, internet of things and big data have huge development prospects for the home appliance industry.

The effect of online channels on the home appliance industry is growing. E-commerce platforms Tmall and JD have become major selling platforms, and the industry is no longer dominated by offline retailing channels such as Gome and Suning, Hoogewerf said.

The report from the China Center for Information Industry Development also showed that the pandemic has reshaped consumer lifestyles, thus promoting changes in the types of home appliances available.

In 2020, the main 4K/8K smart TVs, which feature large screens, ultra-high definition and artificial intelligence, are becoming increasingly popular, as are healthy high-end air conditioners, premium refrigerators with large capacity and disinfection capabilities, and high-end washing machines. Such a shift in preferences has led to changes in the product structure of China's home appliance market and raised average prices.

Data from JD showed that in 2020, sales volume of TVs priced above 10,000 yuan on its platform increased by more than 70 percent year-on-year, and the market penetration rate of WiFi-enabled smart air conditioners increased from 49 percent in the previous year to 63 percent.

Retail sales of refrigerators priced above 20,000 yuan on JD also soared 132 percent last year. Dryers have become the biggest dark horse in white goods market, with market demand expanding significantly and retail sales increasing by 87.4 percent year-on-year.

Li Wenjie, who analyzes the home appliance market for JD, said the outbreak has changed consumer preferences and shopping habits. Chinese manufacturers have to allocate more resources to better exploit emerging opportunities to increase sales and market share, he said.

At the same time, household appliances, such as dishwashers, handheld vacuum cleaners, hairdressing and beauty products and massage chairs also recorded strong sales, which activated the otherwise sluggish home appliance market and also strengthened the role of home appliances in improving people's sense of satisfaction, the report from the China Center for Information Industry Development added.

Experts said the growing desire for smarter and high-end products is expected to continue in 2021, and it is bringing significant opportunities for Chinese and foreign home appliance makers alike.
German home appliance manufacturer BSH Hausgeraete, known for brands such as Siemens and Bosch, said it saw a ""significantly growing demand"" for dishwashers and dryers in China last year, growing 34 and 59 percent, respectively, as the company was the ""strongest non-Chinese home appliance manufacturer in China"".

In China, a ""significant business recovery"" with high growth rates started in last May, more than compensating for turnover losses during the first three months of 2020, BSH said in a statement.
To meet growing demand for its products, Galanz, a Chinese home appliance maker, also built a new plant in 50 days last year in Foshan, Guangdong province. With four new smart manufacturing lines, the baseÔºçwhich is capable of producing a microwave oven each 6.7 secondsÔºçwill have a production capacity of 11 million units annually, Galanz said.

To better pounce on the opportunities, Chinese home appliance maker Haier last month also unveiled a roadmap for the next phase of smart home development.

Demonstrating its leadership in smart home scenarios, solutions and technologies, Haier said it aims to deliver a better experience for users across clothing, food, housing, entertainment and transportation.

For example, Haier's air conditioners will automatically activate a sterilizing function based on detected levels of air pollution to remove seven types of common air pollutants, while releasing negative ions to provide a healthy and comfortable air environment for the family.

""At Haier, we have amassed over 36 years of knowledge from serving more than 180 million households, and gathered observations from tens of millions of connected devices. Our roadmap draws upon this insight and experience into the needs of household users, in order to usher in the future of connected smart home appliances,"" said Wang Ye, vice-president of smart home business at the Haier Home Appliance Industry Group."

After changing the router firewall to mirror all traffic back to my laptop and watching the camera boot, it was apparent that this thing was routing all video back to a cloud storage account I had no control over. What‚Äôs worse, it attempted to open a reverse shell for full remote control. I decompiled the terrible mobile app and found all the info needed to connect back to the developer cameras and watch the developers work in their offices... needless to say, I didn‚Äôt use these cameras in the final build.

JP Morgan has reverse split half of their foreign ETFs, so the price of my position has doubled but I also know that this is considered to be a bad situation for stocks.

2021-04-10 22:12:22,stocks,The value will double but your stocks will be cut in half so you‚Äôll have half the number of shares but each share is worth double.

2021-04-11 07:42:20,stocks,"It has zero meaning.

ETFs aren't stocks. Their prices don't reflect anything.

A reverse split of a company means its stock is dropped below its initial value, which usually means the company is not doing its job of making money.

A reverse split of an ETF is posturing by the managers who want it not to have the same connotation as a low stock price."

China isn‚Äôt stupid. They‚Äôre not going to destroy their largest and most innovative companies. I suspect like other times investors were scared of investing in China this fear will also eventually pass and it will become apparent stocks like BABA are deeply undervalued.

2021-04-10 22:54:30,stocks,"I genuinely don‚Äôt understand the US-centric mindset in the comments. I understand the stances taken at face value, but nothing more, which can be summed up as ‚ÄúMerica, we‚Äôre not corrupt, China is!‚Äù Now, there‚Äôs a nuanced debate to be had there beyond the scope of what I have faith is possible on this sub, but it‚Äôs not as cut and dry as that, not by a long shot and if you believe it is, I have no interest in your opinion.

Moving on, 100k I make in the US market is the same 100k I make on the Chinese market. I‚Äôm in this for money, not politics or moral adherence. Think I‚Äôm alone in this?

Charlie Munger just surprised the hell out of a lot of people when last week he willingly published that he opened a stake in Alibaba sometime between January and February, and not a small one either, 20% of his entire portfolio, making Alibaba his 3rd largest holding. Do I really care about the action of one, albeit experienced, old man? Not particularly. However, the over all consensus across the damn board is BABA in particular out of all of the Chinese tech giants is laughably undervalued, mostly due to the anti-monopoly probe which was opened in December, and, btw, just concluded last Friday with a fine of 2.8(ish) billion in US dollars. Is that a lot? No. No it‚Äôs not. The CCP can fine up to 10% of a company‚Äôs annual earnings under such a probe, as they did with multiple US chip manufacturers about a decade ago, wanna guess what $2.8 billion is of BABA‚Äôs 2019 revenue? 3.7%.. Nothing substantial. Okay, so what about concerns over the CCP splitting BABA, or forcing them to reduce certain dealings? Nope. Go read the full report. There are zero plans to do any such thing. BABA does have to self report that they‚Äôre behaving once a year for 3 years, but that‚Äôs about it. A 3.7% fine, and a report card.

Okay, so maybe logic isn‚Äôt your strong suit, maybe magic crayons (TA) is how you like to blow your 401k. Well you‚Äôre in luck, BABA is at the tail end of a huge bull flag, and has been bouncing off of a perfectly held 3 year trend line support for about 2 weeks as the market awaited what the CCP would do. There hasn‚Äôt been this long of a consolidation period in BABA for a long time, and all over politics. Their books have gotten better and better, the revenue is insane, and their business expansions into cloud computing (we love that don‚Äôt we), web hosting, fin tech payments, and about a few dozen other things is  bullish beyond anything else in the global tech market right now, and smart money is moving on it fast. BABA is Amazon, Microsoft, and EBay (but better) all in one. They are the largest tech company in all of China, and well, if you‚Äôre still going to spout off about ‚ÄúMerica tech!!‚Äù Than, I can‚Äôt help you.

So with that all said, is my money where my mouth is? Yes. I have 42k in calls which I purchased throughout last week of varying dates and strikes, and if there is a dip Monday, I plan to allot 20k more.

With a 600+ billion market cap I don‚Äôt wanna hear a word about trying to ‚Äúpump‚Äù BABA here... If all of us plebs poured out entire families savings into BABA it would have no impact. I‚Äôm here to simply be able to say I told you so I‚Äôm a few months when I hit a few baggers on these calls.

I know there is inherent risks investing in China but that's why we keep diverse portfolios. You've got to be willing to lose money to make money and in this case I think the growth prospects outweigh the risks. 

It's one thing to be unknowingly putting your money into a sham/scam Chinese company (which there are plenty).  Thing is, you should be alright  if you do your DD and have it on good authority your pick is a legitimate company that's up to date on their financial reporting."

1) I don't trust the numbers Chinese companies report. There is no transparency and Chinese companies have much worse track record when it comes to lying (e.g., Luckin Coffee) than western ones. 

2) CCP can step in and mess with any company in any way they want and use them for their goals, which might not be goals good for the company. The fact that any company in China is effectively owned by the CCP can also lead to international sanctions as China is getting more and more aggressive on a global stage (e.g., Huawei). 

3) Morals. A lot of posts here are saying that money is money no matter where it comes from and that the US and other international companies are no saints either. But it is not all black and white. There is a scale between good and evil. As CCP is now, they are too close to evil on that scale for me to be comfortable investing there. 

There is so many amazing oportunities outside of China that i don't see any reason to invest in China when i can invest without all these concerns somewhere else."

2021-04-11 13:40:51,stocks,"> but I‚Äôve been in the market long enough to have seen this thing play out several times before.

Ray Dalio advises this is a dangerous mentality.  Many market cycles only occur once in a lifetime.  Such may be the case with China right now.

Looking at the landscape of just the past couple months, China and Russia have grown closer together.  China is circling Taiwan and Russia is massing at the Ukraine border.  We're headed for another Cold War type scenario - only this time it's bigger with Japan, India, and SK likely to join the U.S./E.U. and China now allying with Russia.  As such, it's a good idea to look at what happened in the early stages of the last Cold War and how previous competitions between empires have played out.

Doing so we see a couple of major risks:

* The U.S. and China will likely continue seeking to decouple their economies in order to reduce exposure to sudden embargoes or tariffs from the other side.

* The U.S. and China *may* ban investment in the other side if the situation becomes extreme

* The U.S. and China will likely end up in a tech race that will accelerate technological advancement and government investment.  (Last time we put a man on the moon in less than a decade).

* The U.S. and China will aim to impede the other sides expansion and economic growth.  (We can see the first example of this with Huawei)."
2021-04-11 16:10:59,stocks,"You completely gloss over the fact that China is not in control of its destiny unilaterally.  It's the western capital pouring into their financial system that keeps it afloat. Without access to western markets,  where China's ultra wealthy can amass assets outside the control of the CCP, it falls apart. 

I don't think it's likely, since as long as western democracies continue to prioritize greed over (inter) national security, China 'wins'. 

I don't invest in Chinese companies on principle. Fuck the CCP. I don't want a world where they run the show, and hopefully everyone else figures out it will be a fucking shit show if they do, before it happens."

2021-04-10 23:26:31,stocks,So you don‚Äôt think the Chinese government is going to forcefully break it it up after fining it for being a monopoly? Sounds like the billion dollar fine is just the beginning. Why wouldn‚Äôt they keep slapping it with these fines if it doesn‚Äôt change?
2021-04-10 22:27:25,stocks,"Here‚Äôs my argument that you are no more likely to be apart of fraud than any other market. There is no metric that says you‚Äôll experience fraud more frequently other than any other market. In fact there is far more fraud in domestic markets(USA leads on various fronts for fraud and it‚Äôs still astronomically low) so if I‚Äôm not alarmed by the amount here why would I be alarmed about potential of Chinese fraud?

What about Chinese companies with international entities not subject to CCP oversight? Most worth while Chinese companies have a large international footprint. If Apple google and Amazon are willing to invest and fund Chinese startups it‚Äôs  a no brain to park cash there.

So with your logic I shouldnt invest domestically.

Name a company you hold that doesn‚Äôt have a history of fraud or illegal actions? I have 20 domestic holdings all have been fined or sued for legitimate reasons. This is the nature of business as we know it.

So when you apply one standard somewhere then move the bar to somewhere else that‚Äôs why I think xenophobia is present when people say ‚ÄúChinese investments are prone to fraud or you‚Äôll lose all your money‚Äù.

China is incredibly dependent on international investment and the world is dependent on China nothing is going to happen and if it does ALL investments will be fubared.

The arbitrage is that I feel people are overly afraid of the same risk that is present here which leads to a artificially reduced multiple and domestic counter parts are trading at an inflated multiple so in 10 years I think I‚Äôll be enjoying the benefits from the purposed risk."

2021-04-11 11:00:13,stocks,It's the rarest superpower.
2021-04-11 16:14:04,stocks,"> New Cold War hurts US and Europe much more than China or Russia.

Disagreed.  It has the potential to hurt both sides, but also the potential to help both.

Cons:

* Both sides will be forced to expend resources on national defense and will seek to deplete the other side by applying pressure (as China is doing to Taiwan)

* China and Russia have their entire seaboard surrounded by allied forces.  Given that shipping is the cheapest way to move goods, it poses a major blockade risk.

* The allies are highly reliant on China for critical raw materials (e.g. Rare Earths) and cheap manufactured goods.

* China owns a great deal of U.S. debt - if they sold it on the open market all at once it could cause serious economic damage.

* China is still fairly reliant on foreign investment for growth (though that is changing)

Pros:

* Competition is a powerful uniting force.  It may act as a catalyst for the U.S. to overcome the deep political divide in the country.  Frankly, if the U.S. can't overcome the divide, China will probably win.

* Competition opens the purse strings of the ultra-rich, because they are the only ones with enough money to fund the fight and higher taxes are ultimately preferable to losing the conflict.  (We can see evidence for this in the strong support for Biden from Big Tech and Wall Street despite knowing they will be eating the lions share of Biden's taxes.)

* Competition forces a hard look in the mirror to clean up inefficiency, and invest in infrastructure.  Because, failure to do so leads to losing the conflict.

* Competition drives technological innovation and investment since the winner almost always ends up being the side that gains the tech edge.

It's worth noting that the 1960s were an incredibly prosperous time for the U.S.  It was a 10 year bull-run for the S&P 500."

No matter what you think about Ants original business model (as it compares to western countries) it was legal under the eye of the CCP for many years.  The fact that they did a complete 180 on the regulation only after Jack Ma made contraverisal remakes is scary.  It is evidence that subordinates is above all else ... But as an investor subordinates isn't good for returns.  I'm sure CCP will not kill business at-will ... But as the private sector grows it will be interesting to see how the CCP will act ... They'll have to cede some power."

2021-04-11 02:17:38,stocks,"I don't really have any opinions on that in particular. I've always lived in the US, so never particularly thought about anywhere else. 

I just think that the US's propaganda machine in terms of how it uses media to demonize other countries has always been strong. I've seen how it has demonized Russia before, how it made Vietnam look evil and soulless, and how it has talked about the Middle East while make it seem like the US is perfect in comparison. We have a ton of issues in the US that we don't fix until they get SO bad and I wish that as a country we were more preventative instead of reactive to things. I personally detest the culture wars that literally caused so many people to die unnecessary deaths in the past year. 

Being Asian-American (I'm Korean ethnically), I've also seen how this kind of propaganda has really created a culture of hatred towards Asians, in general, that I find deeply disturbing. Not so long ago, the US's enemy was Japan due to their booming economy and we saw similar rhetoric demonizing Japan. Vincent Chin was unnecessarily murdered for being mistaken as Japanese. So perhaps this is another reason why I'm, in general, very hesitant of demonizing a country (particularly one that I have never lived in and have only heard about through a very filtered US lens). 

This all being said, of course I am against the situation re: the Uighers but let's be real here, the only reason why a lot of Americans use that is to have an excuse to say ""fuck China"" in the way that a lot of anti-Semitic people just hide it by saying their anti-Zionist. I would take some of the ""fuck China"" people more seriously if they got equally outraged by how our own government has treated the Middle East and also Muslims in our own country.

Btw, this is also just a sub about stocks at the end of the day. My personal opinion is everything is connected to China, we live in a globalized world (whether you like it or not), and the markets are not for ethics because capitalism has always profited off of people's suffering."

They have a huge TAM in one of the fastest growing economies. Heck the values being proposed for a renewed IPO are at $200B. Fingers crossed it probably pops just like Nongfu in the current financial environment. Most tutes are still very interested in it.

With regards to the Jack Ma comments, thats really mostly speculation. We can't say definitively thats the reason.

In these examples, are the prices being referenced just major resistance levels?  If this is the case, are these levels determined just by looking at price action and/or a volume profile?

When I draw these levels on charts, sometimes the prices are obvious support/resistance or inflection points (that I could probably have identified myself).  Other times they're not and so it made me curious what I could be missing.

Hi everyone, so I recently lost my financial services job because I was getting burnt out of 10-12 hour workdays. I was a business analyst with a science degree, so I don't actually know much about investments. 

Looking to take a pay cut and start out in an entry level SAAS sales role. Luckily I was smart enough to sock away every spare penny over the last 2.5 years and have a fat 401k relative to my age. No other assets and I won't inherit anything, so I'd like to set myself up. 

Would you reccomend going in market index funds or hypergrowth stocks at my age? What is your reasoning?

- 100k in 401k allocated across high conviction individual stocks and SPACs (1000 shares of SOFI, 1000 shares of PLTR, 500 shares of GRAB, 1000 shares of qqqj,  and 2000 shares of IPOF are my largest holdings currently).

There's also a company called Aleph Farms but they aren't an investment. If you're looking at cell based meat, that's another story. I think the companies JUST and Memphis Meats are working on cultured meat.

In terms of actually 3d printing any food you want, the idea is there. I'm not sure if you've seen it but there's a video on the Food Theorists youtube channel that talks about a potential way to make this happen.

There's already a company developing something called the Norimaki Synthesizer, which is supposed to be able to replicate any flavor using the 5 basic flavor palettes(sweet, umami, bitter, acidic and salty). If we are eventually able to map out the flavor palette with any flavor imaginable, then the next step would to be to create an edible substance that works in a 3d printer.

You could put in the edible substance in the 3d printer, give it a flavor that you want and literally 3d print whatever type of food you would want. I would assume this is at least 30-40 years out but hey who knows. I wouldn't even be surprised if stuff like this comes out 15 years from now.

Furthermore, with the IT era and AI era, everything is developing much faster now. when aviation was being thought, there was no sharing of information across the globe in an instant, data collection , etc..

I realize Cathy could choose to sell these names at any time, so perhaps the diversification of ARKF is what I should go for. However, buying SQ and chilling also sounds like a good option for me.

That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing when it comes to buying ARKF for SQ. For every $100 you put in ARKF, only $11 goes to SQ, the other $89 goes to everything else. 


Just buy SQ and make it proportional to your risk."

2021-04-10 21:26:38,stocks,"SQ is one of the more interesting companies that's really hard to define. It's like a valuable real world service but with technology company valuation, then mixed with a generous dose of speculative juice (crypt and NFT).

Depending on your view of the mix, this could either be its strength or weakness. In a more value focused market sentiment, the valuation and speculative part is definitely a downside. But in a growth market sentiment these will give them better pump than the competition.

I guess you could look at these aspects to decide whether you want direct exposure or more hedged position."

Market's already priced in inflation and thinks Powell will raise rates early, so what happens when he doesn't? Even if he does it early, despite saying repeatedly he won't, it won't be soon, so Square will probably way too high to go all the way to 210 again.

I looked with portfolio visualizer and see that the largest loss was around -10% since I think 1985 and its greatest drawdown was in the 30% if I'm not mistaken.  It's return has averaged 14% since 1985 also.

So I could see how jnj may be a good moderate growth with little downside risk.

Is this the reason why someone would own a stock like jnj over the sp500?"
2021-04-10 22:59:16,stocks,"JNJ is loved by dividend investors for good reasons, they're a well diversified healthcare giant, and a dividend king. 

Also, I prefer individual stock picking over an S&P500 index for a few reasons.

* A lot of companies in the S&P are just bad investments, or are overpriced. You have to buy all the good and bad companies with an index.

* Individual stock picking lets you concentrate your gains in what you feel are higher quality companies.

* At times when the market is really expensive (like now) there's more risk of under performance if you buy into an index fund. Whereas individual stock pickers can find the stocks that are still undervalued in an overvalued market and concentrate their money there."
2021-04-11 01:36:19,stocks,The healthcare sector etf like vht historically have been delivering 15% return since its inception from early 1980s. Actually right now vht is a super good value growth buy. Many of the big pharma stocks have low forward pe despite in a growth plus defensive sector. At least Biden isn‚Äôt Bernie so he won‚Äôt propose single payer and big pharma stocks should still do ok under him.

*Forward* p/e of 16. I might buy a bit myself the next time I invest. 

Anyway total market funds serve different purposes. You are de-risked. The fund, broadly, is likely to go up over time no matter which scandals erupt or which company winds up in the news. Unless the bogeyman of QE scares you off which I suppose is a legitimate long term concern."

When you're reaching certain levels of wealth, managing risk is much more important than the potential reward, because the goal is to maintain that money and fight inflation.

Dividends are only good if they are shared from the profits generated rather than borrowed money to make investors happy.  A company should not be rewarded by taking on debt to entice investors and diluting equity.  This is bad management especially when it is habitual."
2021-04-11 12:50:18,stocks,"I get that a cash dividend in hand is a return actualized. I don‚Äôt dispute that but I think people make the mistake of focusing on yield too much when evaluating opportunities. 

Also to counter your point: you realize the immediate return but have to pay qualified dividend tax rate on it. I would personally much rather the company, if it has strong management, to either buy its shares back at that lower price or reinvest the cash into the company. You dodge the tax implications in both scenarios while returning shareholder value in option 1 and potentially more shareholder value in option 2. A dollar of dividends from a return standpoint is less attractive because of the forced option; you have to take the cash. If you want income that‚Äôs fine. But I‚Äôm not at the stage where it makes a meaningful difference and I‚Äôm not yield chasing for that reason."

Copper, the current mines supplying the world are running low, and there isnt enough of them to begin with. By 2030 there is said to be a 10 billion ton defecit. Currently the biggest copper mine under construction in over 100 years is said to fill 2% of that defecit.

Why? In history all the major countries in the world went through their industrialization at different times.

Now, the entire world is making a push for green energy at the same time. And there isnt enough copper to go around.

NOVR has forseen this and had been aquiring royalties on strategic copper mines that will be supplying the forefront of this copper defecit since 2018. Do some DD but i think NOVR is going to be a huge payoff one day and they also said they plan to pay dividends one day."

2021-04-10 20:41:18,stocks,"My thoughts are that diversification is great.  I'm also guessing that in the tech area you keep somewhat uptodate, somewhat informed, perhaps adjust your tech-leaning investments a little dynamically based on what tech you see rising vs. falling etc.  So, keep that as it is.  Then take portion of your ""investments"" (whether that's a chunk of your current net worth, or a chunk of your future investments, or a combination of both), and put that toward something else, something non-tech: something from those dividend aristocrats, or some other gleam in your eye.  I've soured on Motley Fool, but wayback, I liked them. They had a ""driportfolio"" or some such wayback and I followed along as they chose KO, INTC and JNJ (maybe another one or two too). I sent a little bit in the direction of those funds each month or quarter, without worrying too much about it, turned on the DRIP feature, ... and they've grown these past two decades without me thinking much about them.  That's what I'd recommend: finding something ""reliable"", something ""slow and boring"", ... and forget about it, let it DRIP reinvest in itself, hopefully you never even look at them til 2041 and get a nice surprise.  Meanwhile, play with your other money on chasing the newest fintech, or battery tech, or utility-scale electricity storage tech, etc.

&#x200B;

The slow and boring might be 10% of your investments? Or 20% Or 30%? And the tech might be the rest? Or any 10x baggers on the tech side -- because that's where you ""risk"" making a home-run type of investment -- gets siphoned off to the ""slow and boring"" side?

&#x200B;

As you say, it's for diversity, diversification. If you can always make 10x investments on the tech side, go for it.  But the ""slow and boring"" is your safety blanket.

&#x200B;

A final thought is that I'm sure there are ""baskets"" of dividend paying, non-tech, companies as an ETF or a mutual fund.  That's another option, a mutual fund of dividend-paying stocks if picking a small-is basket of individual stocks isn't what you want to do?"
2021-04-10 22:59:29,stocks,"I guess I don‚Äôt see the benefit in being in a McDonald‚Äôs or KO for a 27yr old unless it‚Äôs just a piece of a very large overall portfolio. 

My 401k has my mutual funds in it and those are my more stable investments since majority of them own FAANG, PG, KMB, KO, etc.  my other accounts are where I invest more aggressively/strategically. 

So I guess it depends on the objective of your account. I just don‚Äôt see much benefit in the traditional dividend plays for someone your age. If you do, you can go for the dogs of the dow, there‚Äôs some merit there. I would focus on dividend growers though, typically companies that have a lower yield but they raise their dividends pretty significantly each year (SBUX for example).

If you understand tech though and know what you‚Äôre buying, it‚Äôs not wrong to be mainly exposed there... just figure out proper portfolio/risk management. The art of execution was a book I recently read that discusses some of these strategies."

2021-04-11 00:00:00,stocks,"Don't forget about Climate Change in your long-term analysis The US and Global Economy is set for major increases in the coming years, but make no mistake about it, this is the last decade of unmitigiate US economic growth. We have already begun to see major effects as we have been getting record heat waves, Western Region Forest Fires, Polar Vortex collapses, the list goes on and on. 

As more of the Earth's environment is disrupted more effects occur leading to problems for our economic output. Two major examples are the recent ERCOT issue and Covid-19. You should know the story or ERCOT by now, but know that that ice storm was caused by climate change. Storms like that will only increase. 

Second is Covid-19, which was caused by an unhealthy mixing of humans and animals in frontier country in China. This too will only increase as developing nations become more intertwined with the global economy, think African countries who still engage in [Bush Meat Markets](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/bushmeat-explained) which are wholly unsanitary, and threaten to spread disease just like Wuhan Wet Markets do. As the climate is further disrupted, and human population grows, animal movement will lead to unintended species mixing that could lead to animal-human viral spread. 

These are just two examples but the list goes on and on, like [temperature increases impact on agricultural output](https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-agriculture-and-food-supply_.html). 

[And merely a cursory glance at NASA's website](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/index.html) can let you know that human populations will begin to migrate toward temperate zones and richer nations in an attempt to flee the devestation that will be present in equitorial zones. 

All in all, enjoy it while it lasts, and prepare for a rocky, turbulent, wholly unpleasent century."

2021-04-11 06:45:41,stocks,How would you make 12% risk free? Index and mutual funds as far as I know.. Anything else?
2021-04-11 06:59:47,stocks,As Long as printer goes brrr it should be fine
2021-04-11 07:11:31,stocks,I love the sense of humor on this. I laugh üòÜ
2021-04-11 07:16:15,stocks,I‚Äôm 26 and had to explain this to coworkers.  Some of them are heavy in meme/penny stocks and didn‚Äôt understand why they were down when the rest of the market was up.  And they didn‚Äôt understand how unique this current market is.  They literally did not know that stocks can trade sideways for years at a time...
2021-04-11 07:22:41,stocks,"I got over 50% in 2020 and I'd take 5% if it's risk-free... which nothing is. 

So if you promise any % ""risk-free"" I wouldn't take it.

In fact if it's risk-free, you can use your own money to give me that return. Swaps basically, but I won't pay for losses."
2021-04-11 07:28:06,stocks,I've a 17% average return in my ira since I began it in 2014. I'd gladly accept a 12% if it was a sure thing. I've been lucky. My 401k is more like 10%. Expectations should be more like 7.5%
2021-04-11 07:29:41,stocks,"Depends on your capital, objectives, and risk tolerance. Obviously, 12% guaranteed (no risk) returns a year would be incredible, too good to be true, mathematically.

If I had enough money already, 12% a year would be perfect to live just on that. Like, 500k at 10% would be 50k a year, enough to live on that without working. I wouldn't think twice.

However, I need to get to those 500k, first, and fast. 12% is not nearly enough for that, when I can risk it on Teslas and the like which have the potential to get me 100% a year. 12% returns a year on $1000 or $2000 invested is irrelevant. Won't take me anywhere.If you have low capital, you need to risk WAY more."
2021-04-11 07:30:19,stocks,"I‚Äôve been able to hold a 60% plus return for a year. At worst I was at 40%, at best, 80%. I‚Äôm waiting for my big mistake, but so far, things are great. I guess eventually I‚Äôll lose and be happy with a $12% return."
2021-04-11 07:35:18,stocks,With enough money printing even 1200% could be low.....
2021-04-11 07:49:39,stocks,Made 350% from March lows to today.  Hard to write off the anomaly. Even now I've bought the dip through February and March.  I'm not expecting an immediate recovery. But usually when stocks have an over correction it gives you more upside potential
2021-04-11 08:09:42,stocks,"I think among people that have much less in dollar terms invested comparatively high percentage returns aren't as appealing as high dollar returns. Like if I have 1k invested making 120 in a year is nice but it's hard to really get enthusiastic about that. I'm not defending the stance you're talking about, and I do think that new retail investors entering the market in droves is going to produce negative outcomes based on ignorant assumptions like that, but that's what seems to be their reasoning IMO. and really, to their credit, I think it's hard to get excited about the prospect of locking a grand up with the hope of, if you're lucky, making a hundred dollars. 

with increased retail investor participation is increased participation of people who don't have large sums of money to invest. and when you have large sums of money invested 12% is amazing, but when you don't it's worth taking some risk."
2021-04-11 08:10:47,stocks,"I mean. VRA is staking currently at 25.55%apy until March 1 2021

Times are changing, but I do agree with you that people's expectations are now super inflated, you still need to understand what's realistic"
2021-04-11 08:23:43,stocks,"I stated in February and am so far down 6%, and was for quite some time down over 10%. My expectations are calibrated to the current times."
2021-04-11 08:35:39,stocks,"Are you maybe reading the responses wrong?

Like as in they don‚Äôt believe the 12% will be consistent, so they refuse a possible scam?  

Or are they all replying no, I can consistently beat 12%?"
2021-04-11 09:47:22,stocks,I've been investing for 10 years and I typically get around 10-15% return. last 12 months I'm up 84%. I know this won't happen too often and I actually didn't do anything risky but will say it was fun while it lasted. gonna pretty much just hold until I need the cash.

2021-04-11 10:26:39,stocks,"Ever consider there are people who have different risk appetite than you? Or maybe that college kid who only has 500 bucks in his savings realizes that he isn't going to improve his financial situation by gaining 60 bucks in a year..hell, I would argue he's an idiot for taking the 12%. Also, keep your pessimism to yourself - how the fuck would you know this won't be like 2020? Your Boomer mindset has you really believing the market will revert to the mean no matter what... well, 
the world doesn't work like that. Thr market is random as fuck. 

Anyways - how about respecting people who dream bigger than yourself? And we can respect you and your 12% ticket."

2021-04-11 11:50:48,stocks,Only reason I would say no is because this seems too good to be true and most likely will get scammed ala ponzi scheme or something (Madoff)
2021-04-11 11:56:23,stocks,Theres a big difference between making 12% on hundreds of billions and making 12% on something like 10 grand.
2021-04-11 12:12:49,stocks,"This thread got me but to me it seems investors are new now. Reddit is full of new investors asking basic questions here instead of looking it up and using Reddit to bounce ideas. The older investors are still here wanting to help but I find myself moving on as it‚Äôs the same discussions everyday. I don‚Äôt see as many people here who are motivated, I just see tell me what to buy dividends are life and xyz stock to the moon or it‚Äôs gotta go up mentality. People want 12% because they started in 2020 and made 50-100% and are hooked. It‚Äôs dangerous. My barber is now a (expert) he has 75 companies and only owns 15 full shares. He is buying partial shares of big companies. Little do folks know you can‚Äôt sell partial shares. If you put 50$ in Tesla you have to continue to buy a full share in order to sell. 

I wish you all the best and commend those who continue to try and help on this page. Your education and factual comments are most likely perused by hard charging investors."

2021-04-11 12:34:58,stocks,"Most of the existence of the stock market has been a bull market and the average annual return for S&P 500 since its inception is 10-11%. SPY has seen an average of 13% annualized ROR since it came about in 1993. Timing is important of course, but you can pretty comfortably invest in an ETF like SPY and check back every 7 years or so to see your initial investment double."
2021-04-11 12:36:31,stocks,"The only reason people even talk about 12% returns is cause we are in an market bubble for the 14 years now. People are calling it a bull market but it‚Äôs really more a market fueled by stimulus, bailouts, stock buy backs, close to zero interest rates for 14 years straight, and more stimulus. And then if that‚Äôs bad enough to and causing a bubble of inflated stock prices, then there is more stimulus. And it just goes on and on. Honestly the fed messed up because they need to allow markets and interest rates find their own true value without constant intervention and free borrowing. Now we really need stimulus cause of something serious like covid and the books are already cooked. It‚Äôs all gonna crumble at some point. If we don‚Äôt pay the price, future generations willl. Countries like Japan, Germany, and others stopped all this stimulus low interest rate no interest a long time ago because it crushed them. They don‚Äôt allow  banks to gamble with customers money, trading all kinds of unregulated derivatives, and all this other nonsense that causes market bubbles. They allow markets to correct on their own and do not keep interest rates low forever just for a quick profit now. They keep future generations in mind and don‚Äôt try to manipulate market forces now for a quick game... cause it all comes back to haunt you and destroy you. Other countries have learned. The US has not.... going to be a huge disaster at some point I am sure of it."
2021-04-11 12:42:06,stocks,See I would take 12% if I had more money but I‚Äôm broke so that would only end up being like 50$
2021-04-11 14:18:50,stocks,Please give me 12% per year ... I would pay a premium to lock this in!
2021-04-11 15:17:50,stocks,Very true
2021-04-11 17:08:02,stocks,Guys if i knew how to make 12% RISK FREE i wouldn't tell everyone via social media. I would lend all the money i can get from multiple banks and invest without telling anybody.
2021-04-11 17:25:31,stocks,"12% nominal return, or 12% real return? That's the real question"
2021-04-10 21:04:37,stocks,"Or maybe some traders with the help of easily accessible online trading platforms without commisions and easy access to information are starting to be able to compete with the big guys of wallstreet. I agree that returns this year are realistically unsustainable and returns will definitely going to be lower over the next few years, and those who only buy stocks like gme, amc, and tsla won't last forever. However I am optimistic about the future of retail trading. I think it is beyond possible for retail traders to make more than 12% per year consistenly because of how much easier trading has become. Just my take. I would rather make 30%+ with risk than say a 7% from spy."
2021-04-10 20:05:19,stocks,"S&p 500 has been doing 15% for a while now, so they probably have a distorted view of what a normal return is Most new traders have no idea what returns should be expected."

I DO agree people really need to lower theyre expectations, but that doesn't mean the people that can beat 12% fairly consistently aren't out there.

I've made about 12% in 2021 so far while everyone else seems to be losing. Just depends.  I personally would never limit myself to agreeing to 12% risk free locked in."

2021-04-11 08:40:43,stocks,"I‚Äôm one of those new 2020 investors and I guess I need some advice now so I don‚Äôt get burned. I made 60% last year and I‚Äôm up about 10% this year. I‚Äôve done a mix of ETFs that I don‚Äôt touch, some stable companies that got hit hard (traditional automakers, airlines), some individual tech stocks (Paypal, square, Etsy) and a little bit in some risky short term flips for a quick $100 profit here and there (RKT, GME). I‚Äôm not doing the quick flips any more. In the recent drop I picked up Target, Costco, Zillow and Peloton and all have returned 10-15% already. 

Reading the sentiment here it seems I should sell everything to lock in those gains and move everything to market ETFs. 

I‚Äôm kind of frozen, not sure what to do next. It seems I need to ask myself which companies I think still have a lot of growth potential and which are already overheated."

2021-04-11 15:48:34,stocks,"to be fair, someone who would prefer a higher return with some risk rather than a guaranteed fixed 12% doesn't automatically mean someone is assuming every year will see growth like april 2020 through the end of the year.

likewise, unless i'm mistaken, the notion that ""the stock market returns 7-9% per year on average"" is only looking at share prices. there's lots of money to be made with stocks beyond just simple share price appreciation.

selling covered calls add effectively zero risk as long as someone is setting a strike price that would represent a profit. combine this with some cash secured puts on good companies at low strikes, and while adding some risk to the equation, and someone has created a 3 pronged strategy (4 prong if you're separating dividends out from share growth) that could represent a lot more gains than the ""fixed 12%"" would have.

there are always going to people that would prefer a chance at 20-25%/year with some risk over half that with no risk. (this is especially going to be true in lower to moderate sized portfolios where this can accelerate reaching the person's real target of being able to live off their portfolio)"
2021-04-11 15:55:08,stocks,I have higher than 20% yearly returns. I doubled up in about a 12 month period. I would still take 12% risk free if it's guaranteed in perpetuity.

2021-04-11 02:11:38,stocks,"I don't agree with 10x or going to zero. I do like the thought of 10x or maximum loss of 1/2 though. Also I've noticed that most 10x stocks are so insanely overvalued it could take 20 years to hit a new 10x value because they have already 10x from the hype.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't invest in a 12% risk-free investment because I have grown a lack of distrust towards people when it's related to money. I would imagine it's a scam of some kind."
2021-04-11 02:44:34,stocks,">	Powell also said that investors could expect plenty of advance notice before the Fed would start to pull back on the asset purchases it has been making in the bond market.

He is in a funny position. Of course no one will wait for him to announce his intentions, no one wants to be left holding the bag. Big players will try to anticipate him, the market will stay nervous and tumble for nothing.
See what happened this February-March, on a mere expectation that interest rates may be raised in a less-far future than projected.

Couple the market choppiness with the extensive use of leverage (see Archegos) and the risk of localized or general collapses increases.

How do you eventually turn off the faucets that keep the market afloat, knowing that it will easily cause a rout? It‚Äôs disaster waiting to happen.
The logical thing to me is to do it when people are as happy as they can be. When everything is going well, they can take the blow better. Which means a healthy economy is now in one way the enemy of the stock market. And retail will take it in the face when it least expects it."
2021-04-11 01:07:35,stocks,‚ÄúStocks are overvalued‚Äù is just ‚Äúmarket crash incoming‚Äù with extra steps. People have been saying this for years.

2021-04-10 20:02:18,stocks,"Yeah, there are lots of people who feel that the stock market is safe until feds raise interest rates... I don't think it's that simple. And how would you know you can pull out before the smart money whenever they decide to take profits?

I don't think people will be waiting around until the news of interest rates rising before they pull out. By the time you hear it on the news, isn't it already too late?"
2021-04-11 01:46:36,stocks,Banks wouldn't lend to you at anything less than 5% interest haha. Else they'd just take the risk-free rate too.
2021-04-11 00:02:01,stocks,"Actively managed Mutual funds. Mutual funds underperform the market most of the time, this was from the academic study and observed thru the past decade. I don‚Äôt not believe hedge funds are measured as they don‚Äôt always have a proper benchmark based on their trading or strategy.

So think actively managed mutual funds which are available to most investors underperforming because they employ the JV team, getting 2/20 fee structure is hella attractive, so the best money managers move towards opening a hedge fund closed to outside public money, only accredited investors. The hedge funds outperform the markets consistently and by double digits. Additionally, the fund itself doesn‚Äôt have to outperform the market, rather just have a better risk adjusted return.

Even with mutual funds, it‚Äôs 50/50 or 60/40 where they can beat the benchmark or not. So I avoid actively managed mutual funds, but if I have an opportunity to throw $250k into a hedge fund and it being only 10% of my stack, I would invest with a hedge fund looking for uncorrelated returns."
2021-04-11 15:25:23,stocks,"I like Warren Buffett's take on the topic.  He famously bet that hedge funds would under perform, and it was quite a large bet too.  After winning the bet he explained his logic, ""Roughly half will out perform the market and roughly half will under perform the market.  When you factor in fees it will give an overall tilt towards under performance.""  This implies he thinks stocking picking gives the high majority of people random odds.  So far the numbers line up with this.  Warren Buffett chose an investing style that had a massive upside in the 60s to the 80s, but since then his investing style has under performed, looking like it is reverting to the mean, and he simply got lucky being in the right time period and picking the right strategy for the time.  Eventually the market changes, alpha dries up, and strategies need to change with it."

2021-04-11 15:29:11,stocks,"All we need is 10 years in a row of this to match the 1920s.  The '20s was a crazy time.

I don't think we can come close today for two reasons:  1) Most of the noobs are trading, not investing.  Trading ends up with loses much quicker, so reckless trading corrects itself within a year or two.  2) Most people are on margin of 50%, maxing out at a margin of 25%.  There is 3x leverage, and many options trades can hit up to 6x leverage with of course outliars, but in the 1920s 10x margin was the normal.  3) We don't have much in the way of reckless investing today, like there was in the 1920s.  Reckless investing can take a decade to correct."
2021-04-11 02:20:24,stocks,That is crazy how fast they have given up. I've been on the up for both Tesla and GME since early January and I still never got bored for red days. Red days get me excited because there is so much to learn there.

2021-04-11 08:52:05,stocks,"Yeah I am a newer investor too and I think there are three different games being played here. Many in this sub smartly invest their monthly savings into the market and therefore pick stable ETFs. Their return potential in dollars is huge even at lower returns. In a sense they use the market for their savings the same way many use their 401k. 


Younger new investors, like myself, have most of their savings in an online savings account at like 1% return, and ‚Äúplay‚Äù with a chunk of money that they are flipping over and over for 20-50%+ returns. By keeping a big chunk out of the market we‚Äôre protecting against a big loss. Most of us remember 2009. 


Then there are the YOLO guys who are throwing their life savings at a single volatile stock. Those guys terrify me."

Also, the interest rates have been incredibly low--this could be (and I believe it at least is partially responsible for) a reason for the increased P/E ratio we've seen in the 2000s.

2021-04-11 02:53:41,stocks,"Just a small suggestion for the future. Whenever you‚Äôre trying to judge your stock picks, always compare them to the standard default index funds like the S&P500. Comparing it to the interest you‚Äôd earn at a bank is nearly a worthless comparison. The risk profiles are just too different to get any sense of the quality of your picks."
2021-04-11 10:16:56,stocks,Long term AAPL is a winner.  I got 50 shares @92.
2021-04-11 11:20:36,stocks,"I bought some Apple stock in 2015/2016 when I started investing. It was about 120 then and over the next few years dropped as low as 90. I was disappointed in it at the time and worried that I had bought it at the top of the market.

 I considered buying some more while it was lower, but put the money into something else since I was worried that I was making that decision based on wanting to see the red in my portfolio go away. 

Just remember that these decisions are usually  more difficult at the moment. I believe my single greatest investment percentage-wise is a reinvested dividend from that time period. 3 bucks to 20. The best I've done (and 5-6 is not a lot to draw conclusions from) is when I bought something for the long term when there was what I considered a short-term dip. 

I missed a lot of great opportunity from Tesla to Square because they either weren't on my radar or I wasn't doing fractional shares at the time, but I ended up investing more money than I would have set aside for a passive investment, so I'd have to really do poorly for it not to be worth trying to play the market (with my IRA, my 401k is all index). I would take 3% returns on 20k invested over 6% returns on 5k invested, if it came to that."
2021-04-11 06:32:02,stocks,">My bank only gives me 0.5% interest guaranteed per year

2021-04-11 09:29:01,stocks,But most couldn't. 12% a year is 3 times what you had initially in 10 years. I'd say that most of the people you're talking about don't have 100k to trade with so 12% a year (or ~1% per month) isn't actually that good. You could easily get more if you get good at it.

2021-04-11 07:42:51,stocks,"I agree that if the Fed had complete control of the situation, then the logical thing to do would be to make the announcement when everything is going extremely well and people are happy. 

However, I believe that the Fed is in much less control than they think. I think inflation will hit hard and fast and not be transitory as the Fed claims. For whatever the reason, I believe economic factors will force the Fed's hand much earlier than they had planned.

This is what the big players will be looking for, in an attempt to anticipate the Fed being forced to back off on their dovish policies. And every hedge fund manager on Wall Street probably has their hand hovering over a gigantic ""sell everything"" button. They know that if they don't sell first, they will be holding the bag. So every hedge fund manager will be racing all of the others to sell faster than the next guy.

When the sell-off really happens, it will be incredibly violent."

It is possible for people's high conviction stocks to rise another X% and have a correction to a higher price than today. It is also possible for the stock to drop lower than today's price and trade sideways for 3 years. No one really knows and each person has to assess their own risks."

In the Short-Run, the Market Is a Voting Machine, But in the Long-Run, the Market Is a Weighing Machine.

Right now, there‚Äôs seems to a bubble from a lot of stocks.  The possible growth does not justify their valuations.  It‚Äôs like there is an exponential growth when reality though the tech benefited from
Covid restriction  theres a lot that are barely profitable and some are not even profitable yet.    Those market trajectories are not sustainable.  And just like Keynes said

The Market Can Remain Irrational Longer Than You Can Remain Solvent.

There was dot.com bubble, housing bubble and right now too many stocks are in cloud 9.  I am hoping the bull run continues but Fed had to manage the inflation too."

The whole effort was fruitless.  That's how gambling works, regardless what instrument it is.

A lot of trading subs have been pushing the Kelly Criterion hard this last week for hopefully obvious reason.  (It's a formula that tells you our largest safe bet size.)  Unfortunately, little do they know that the Kelly Criterion just keeps them in the game longer.  Roughly half of successful perpetual traders (roughly 4% of traders.  Roughly 96% give up.) make more than investing in an index fund, so about 2% of traders.  The other 2% make less than index funds but typically don't realize it so they keep going."

2021-04-11 14:19:03,stocks,"It‚Äôs quite bifurcated, the best hedge funds out perform whereas bad funds go bust.

But it‚Äôs hard to simply bench mark the fund performance to the S&P 500 and call it a day. A total market index has a beta of 1 or think of it as expected return of 1 for 1 unit of risk.

So for these academics to measure a hedge funds outperformance or underperformance relative to Beta of 1, is hard, because the hedge funds don‚Äôt release the strategy or can their beta be measured easily. I guess the long only funds can be measured but they don‚Äôt represent the same risk/strategy as a quant trading firm, or a high frequency trading firm, etc. So how does one create benchmarks for those firms and those trading strategies? The reality is that there isn‚Äôt an easy comparable. 

The study Warren buffet did looked at fund of funds and aggregated a huge number of funds and took average performance. And each layer in the fund of funds took management fees and performance fees, which zapped returns. So the structure of how one deploys capital is important, a fund of funds strategy is basically trying to chase the law of large numbers and return the expected return less fees structure. Which isn‚Äôt the point of using a hedge fund, why would we want to diversify and wash out our returns while lowering risk via diversification when the idea of a hedge fund is to minimize downside risk already? 

But if we look at 2008, the crash, all the hedge funds measured in Warren‚Äôs bet outperformed because they did what they were supposed to do, hedge and return alpha, returns not explained by the market performance. So the study didn‚Äôt provide a view on the risk adjusted returns vs simply just saying ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt beat the market‚Äù. If people take more risk, they have a higher expected return. But what if the hedge fund is taking less risk than the total market risk? Where they have both a long/short position with a long bias or do events driven trades or buys undervalued distressed bonds? How does one measure the risk there? 

So while I don‚Äôt disagree with the studies published, the measurement approach and methods of measurements used to draw a conclusion, and then having the reader generalizing those conclusions is what I disagree with. Hedge funds are all lumped together when in fact, they have a TON of differing strategies. But it‚Äôs always compared to, a total market index as a benchmark, that‚Äôs strange to me.

Like I said, if you have a stack and are an accredited investor. Setting aside 10-20% to allocate to a hedge fund that has a unique trading strategy is more diversification and can provide uncorrelated returns for your portfolio."

2021-04-11 07:49:10,stocks,That‚Äôs a different scheme.  Ponzi vs Pyramid
2021-04-11 10:10:06,stocks,"Anyone in the ponzi scheme is being ripped off. Different approaches. In the pyramid scheme you have to continuously decentralize sales until lower levels of the pyramid reach a point of exhausted marginal returns. It usually happens fast, like if you aren't one or two layers into the Aveda distribution hierarchy.

In the Ponzi scheme, you have structured an annuity with payments made out of newly invested principal. If you guarantee a 12% return and are early enough to receive several years of coupons, you still lose out enormously when the scheme implodes and your principal is insolvent. 

For context, and assuming you were compounding the interim returns through reinvestment, if you received a 10% annual yield you would have doubled your money between 8 and 9 years (depends on compound period and coupon payment). If the Ponzi scheme lasted that long, and a decade would be very impressive fraud, your principal would be insolvent at the end and so your 100% gain would mean that you actually returned zero net dollars. 

In the end, you would have outpaced yourself investing in 5yr Treasurys."

VTSAX is total stock market, same as VTI, which includes sp500 which represents 75% of the total US stock market, and it includes the other other 25% of publicly traded companies, that are in the mid and small cap segments. The reason it has lower dividends is because it includes the small and mid cap 25% of the market, and those companies are focused on growth instead of not knowing what else to do with their leftover capital. That said, VTI's dividends aren't far off from VOO (1.29% vs 1.43%)."

2021-04-10 21:50:17,stocks,"I'm not trying to discredit your accomplishment by any means. Like you pointed out, you did much better than the SP500 but not much better than the nasdaq. That's most likely attributed to nasdaq being the listing of most growth stocks recently. There hasn't been a bear market longer than 3 months in that time frame so people haven't really had to cycle through many stock sectors. Picking a couple big growth names and holding would have done tremendously well since 2012 (such as FAANG). When the annualized returns really show their strength is during periods of both bull and bear markets. The SP500 having an average return near 10% despite ups and downs is its strength and why indexes almost always beat individual stocks. Fun exercise, eliminate the 2000-2009 time frame from the SP500 history and see what the return would be. If individual stocks were to cycle into different sectors for a prolonged bear market then you eat away gains by paying taxes. Either you deduct that from the previously unrealized return or you can hold onto the same stocks during the down turn and see what happens."

2021-04-11 15:13:27,stocks,"First, thanks for trying to explain it to me. 
What I got from this is that not only the return matters in the end but also the risk you took for that return. As in if I have a beta of 0 but still end up with the same returns as the market that'd be better than simply investing in the market portfolio. That's because if the market crashes I wouldn't be affected with that investing strategy.
Is that correct ? 
What prof. Damodoran said was that on average hfs underperform the market and take fees. So you're saying what he's missing is that the objective of hedge funds is not only to deliver returns but also secure investors money so that they don't lose it in a crash ?

2021-04-11 06:31:51,stocks,"Not without risk. There's both currency risk (USD denominated accounts pay less than local currency accounts) and default risk (the bank goes under). Inflation risk is related to this, with local currencies.

Most of these countries either have no, or very low deposit guarantee schemes, Bangladesh for example IIRC guarantees only $800. FDIC in the US is $250,000, SIPC is $500,000.

Finally even if they did guarantee more, the creditworthiness of the governments themselves is limited, sovereign states also default.

This can extend even to developed Western countries and major currencies, during the euro crisis for example Cyprus although honouring the deposit guarantee up to ‚Ç¨100,000 took a haircut above that. And this is a developed country and the second largest reserve currency on the planet.

>Under the arrangement, depositors in Bank of¬†Cyprus¬†will receive shares in the lender worth 37.5pc of any savings over ‚Ç¨100,000, while the rest may never be paid back, according to a statement from the¬†Cypriot¬†central bank.

It's even higher risk in the sort of countries that are giving 5-7% on deposits.

Even middle income developing countries that are *somewhat* stable, you don't get these returns. I live in Thailand, bank deposits max out around 1% here. But the banks are relatively stable. Still not to the level of US, Euro, Japan, Singapore ones, but relatively. I wouldn't sweat having a million THB or 2 in a Thai bank.

Cambodia and Laos you will get much higher %. I haven't checked recently, last time I did they were going down but even over 8% was common. But that's not without risk, large deposits in developing country Asian banks have a significant risk, they are not like sticking your money in a FDIC guaranteed US account."

2021-04-11 11:54:26,stocks,"But they made it sound like it was a 100% sure thing and you could never lose. Say you bought AAPL leaps right now at $130 for Mar 2023, what they were suggesting (they didn't suggest a stock but they said 2023 LEAPs at the money for their recommended buys). 1 contract would set you back about $2500, so your break even at expiry is $155. Anything below that and you lose money. 

Break even vs buying the 19 shares you could get with that money would be around $161 because of the gains you get on the shares. Downside risk is much less on the shares as well. The stock would have to drop to $0 for you to lose more money. So you have huge upside with a massive downside risk. Is it a pretty safe bet that AAPL hits $161 by Mar 23? I'd say yes, but will the person know when to sell it?"
2021-04-11 14:40:20,stocks,"Okay, so what are you doing right now to help those people in need?"
2021-04-11 16:10:26,stocks,"So I don‚Äôt think Beta can be 0 (because there has to be some type of systematic risk) but yes, the general idea is a .5 beta has half the volatility (risk) of the total market and should in theory have half the expected returns so if index was up 10%, the asset would return 5%. 

So if the market crashes and the asset has a lower beta, then yes, it wouldn‚Äôt fall as much, but there‚Äôs a general correlation to total market returns. Funds also use sharpe ratio (which factors into risk free rates of return). 

So take a simple example of a long and short position fund. In a mega crash, the two positions should in theory cancel out. The skill comes with picking correct stocks to long and short, if no crash comes, then the fund outperforms while having a hedge against a crash. The strategy isn‚Äôt as popular anymore according to a hedge fund analyst I follow but it‚Äôs always had a long side bias because stocks tend to go up.

Also, if you explore uncorrelated returns. That‚Äôs an interesting concept. Event trades that has nothing to do with the market and are event driven. I made $52k from GME/AMC trades. Random, event driven, retail investor craziness. It‚Äôs peanuts compared to most people on that trade but the return represents excess return the S&P/Nasdaq can‚Äôt explain. There were hedge funds that piled in when they knew the craze was on and they exited before it popped at $380. They were in and out, got the bag and left. 

So the question is, how much risk did the fund take  when they jumped in, had better info that most market players, knew the true timing of Melvins exit of their short positions, and when the retail volumes surged to provide an exit to their long position. 

Another strategy is buying distressed assets/bonds from companies everyone expects to go out of business. But hedge funds will dive deeper and realize that a company can survive longer than the market suggests and that the company bond prices don‚Äôt reflect the higher % of survivability, is returning double digit coupon rates, and trading WELL below par. Those funds have made a killing.

That‚Äôs the uncorrelated risk/return strategy to the total market return I would like to have as part of my portfolio."

If you only got 6%, you'd have only $105k at the end of it, barely more than you started with.

If you put the same $100k in US 10-year bonds, you'd have $144k. Long-term treasury bonds, you'd have $183k. These, being backed by the US government have *substantially* less risk than Indian bonds, and you still end up with more at the end.

2021-04-11 04:09:57,stocks,"I try to avoid trading by anything but technical analysis. I got my own thing that I'm not going to discuss that is vastly different from what people commonly associate with technical analysis, things like looking for Ws, Ms, teacups, and head and shoulders. Most of that is like reading tea leaves.

Fundamentals sound great, but to trade based on them is to trade based on how the market *should* behave. And I don't care about how the market should behave. I care about how it does behave. So I use technical analysis to react appropriately and profitably to what the market is doing, rather than what it should be doing. 

I think that this subreddit has a clear bias against technical analysis. That's okay. I think most people's understanding of TA is based on things that don't work, and based on unrealistic expectations of what TA should be expected to do."

It's like tons of people (and algos)  have the same instruction book that says to buy X stock at Y price, and sell at Z price. So then the price goes up at Y, and down at Z ""just as predicted"""
2021-04-10 20:55:47,stocks,"I'm trying to start a meme where we draw a distinction between technical analysis and trading strategies that rely on TA. TA is just math. So when people say things like ""TA is bullshit"" I hear ""Math is bullshit."" I'm not sure what it even means to say math is bullshit.

People mean of course that trading strategies involving TA are bullshit and can never work. But considering the number of different tickers and timeframes and indicators, there are more or less an infinite number of possible strategies. It's possible to prove a specific strategy doesn't work by backtesting. But it's impossible to prove that out of all possible strategies none of them work. The best you could say is I've not yet found a TA strategy that beats buy and hold.

Even people who claim to hate TA use TA. Boring old Bogleheads know that the market goes up on average 10% per year. Meaning they have taken a moving average based on discrete price data and then calculated the slope of the line. They are using past price action to anticipate future price movements. Any strategy that looks at past prices is using TA.

I've heard multiple people claim a TA strategy using mean reversion can be viable. It seems plausible because you see the market over react quite often. I haven't done the work to confirm it. The existence of so many algos also makes me skeptical of claims that no one uses TA."

2021-04-11 08:55:21,stocks,"TA should not be the only factor to make trading decisions. It is combination of multiple things. For me it goes like this:

1) Know the statistical odds of the setup to do certain move. It typically requires pretty extensive tracking of the data.

2) Know the fundamentals behind the stock - catalysts, warrants, offerings, etc.

3) If you see a setup with high probablity based on your stats and good fundamentals behind it - use TA and tape for your trade management- entries, exits, scales.

To my mind trading off one thing like TA is profoundly stupid and you have too many unknowns behind the setup you are trading. Having all 3 mentioned things covered gives you conviction and if a stock does not do what it supposed to, you simply stop out and move on. In the long  term the odds are on your side if you do this properly."

I also look at the select lists from different analysts: Credit Suisse, Schwab, Morningstar, KBW, etc.  Sometimes these reports will shine a light on something I missed. For example, just saw a report that there could be some new inclusions to the S&P Index. Stuff like that can definitely move a stock price up for those included, and down for those removed."

I don't entirely agree with the critics when they say it's astrology, because something like support and resistance levels are seen in the order book. But once a breakthrough happens must a resistance level become a new support? I don't see the reasoning. And one can definitely go overboard on all the trendlines - pennants, triangles, etc - that give it a very heavy palm-reading vibe. That's where the criticisms are more valid."

Your example of ‚Äúa firm securing a big deal guaranteeing massive profits...‚Äù, leading to a drop in price because people thought it was bad reflects the subjectivity of the market, but is unrealistic.  In addition, even if the price dropped with this great deal with massive profits, the fundamental investor (long term B&H), would likely still be happy because of the earnings gained by this successful company. Value is value (where as price is all over the place). 

Yes, even with FA, the market has subjective components, but there is a big difference between patterns of a squiggly line and actual earnings and business developments.

>Buying individual stocks have showed me how risky they are, and so hard to keep track of them.

It's not for everyone. If you don't know how to analyze a stock, read financial statements, read SEC-Filings. Stay away from it. You're better off buying ETFs or niched ETFs based on the sector/industry that you're interested in. Always choose whatever helps you sleep at night

No one has the crystal ball for this. Just cost-average it and you're golden. If the market goes up this month, buy. If the market goes down next month, buy. That's it, so you won't be too emotional about it. The market is always there no matter what."

It grew revenue by 14% to $886 million and earned positive operating income ($7 million) for the first time in its existence. It grew its market share 7 basis points in 2020 to 1%. In the fourth quarter, it was the most-visited brokerage site, with 4 times more traffic than the second largest.

Redfin is innovating in a number of ways. It charges a commission of 1.5%, half of the typical 3%. It is also active in the ""iBuying"" market, where it buys real estate from people and resells it, which offers sellers a quick sale. And it is growing its offerings that are ancillary to the real estate transaction, such as mortgage origination and title services.

The real estate market in the United States is large and comparatively undisrupted. This offers an innovator like Redfin a significant opportunity, which we are optimistic it will seize.

&#x200B;

and this is their writeup for PINS: 

&#x200B;

 

We've made **Pinterest** [(NYSE: PINS)](https://www.fool.com/premium/company/341100) a pretty regular fixture among our Best Buys, as well as a two-time *Rule Breakers* recommendation. And one thing we've often noted is the huge gap between average revenue generated by U.S. users and by those abroad. It's especially important considering that Pinterest is growing its user base internationally at a very rapid pace ‚Äî up 46% in 2020 versus an 11% increase in U.S. monthly average users.

In that context, 2020 gave just what we wanted: Average revenue per user pushed up a nice 27% in the U.S. but an amazing 62% overseas. And the trends were even better in the fourth quarter. Shares of Pinterest stock surged almost 18% in February on the heels of that report.

Yet the share price is lower now than it was before the company reported those great results. There's no specific reason for that ‚Äî at least, nothing related to the company's performance ‚Äî which makes this a good time for investors to consider establishing a position or adding to an existing one. After all, there's plenty to be excited about in the year ahead. Management continues to be conservative in its guidance, offering an outlook only for the current quarter, but still expects revenue growth ""in the low 70s"" percentage-wise.

Moreover, there is a lot of work going on to improve the platform. Story Pins, a beta launch from late last year, offers creators a way to make dynamic stories involving images, video, voice-over, and text, along with analytical tools to track performance. The company is building a community of celebrity content creators across a range of interest areas and making it easier for users to follow them. And it continues to find ways to improve shopping on the platform for both users and advertisers. The pandemic brought a lot of new users to Pinterest, and we don't think they're going to leave."

2021-04-11 00:00:00,stocks,"3rd posting : 50 days performance of the list This is the [January 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kos2tt/what_are_your_next_below_50_below_30below_20/)  post which got good discussion. This is the [February 19](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lnwgbt/one_month_ago_stocks_list_post_to_today/) continuation.

Suggestions please:

1. Ranking by % change to Jan vs having a specific order of stocks (alphabetically or any order suggestions)
2. Any stocks to include or exclude. Do let me know in comments.

I think sticking to any specific order would be helpful which will be easy in scanning rather than looking for the % change ranking order everytime. If so, who gets to decide the order ? any thoughts.  I will try to curate on industry type or something.

Please suggest on the above 2nd point. That will be much more helpful for everyone.

Exciting news from Arht media. They run a hologram platform used to allow presenters and speakers to beam in to events remotely. It was most recently used at EPITOME an in-person conference for young entrepreneurs and was well received.

I'm more excited for the prospect that this tech could be used for permanent installation of tech-forward advertising or graphics either in events centers or outside of buildings as a more attractive alternative to billboards. It could also see use in being able to relay live speaker presentations to multiple locations imagine being able to experience something like TED live without the travel or capacity limits by having the presentation relayed to multiple events centers simultaneously."

What is difficult to pick however is the companies that will win in the long run. In the end companies will be competing with eachother in prices internationally as more and more countries start to legalise although that seems more than a decade away. In America alone however I see full legalisation happen in a few years but even then it will take years for the industry to mature fully.

PV- price of stock today
PMT- dividend payments
N - years projected
FV - estimated future market cap / estimated shares outstanding (future price)

Rate - solve for rate of return

In practice I find that using an IRR calculation is better so you can assume dividend raises over time.

I have found that DDM or FCF yield, EBITDA, relative valuations never get the whole picture because rates of return boil down to TVM

Called Fidelty and they said they cannot do it(restricted by laws and regulations). And other brokers like WeBull have this same restriction. Even Robinhood itself will tell you that you must have at least $2,000 in your account balance to trade on a margin account. But somehow, robinhood will still allow you to trade with a margin account even when your balance is under $2,000. How is this possible?"

2021-04-11 10:03:33,stocks,"Um....

""Margin"" is the assets you have in the account that can be used as collateral. They can include cash or high-quality securities.

""Margin debt"" is the amount you have borrowed against your margin.

A ""margin account"" is allowed to borrow against margin, meaning you can buy even if you are out of cash, as long as the ratio of margin to total assets in your account is high enough. (Buying with unsettled cash isn't borrowing against margin.)

A ""cash account"" can only buy with cash it has in the account. (The cash doesn't have to be settled, but it does have to settle properly or the new buy will be cancelled.)"

2021-04-11 10:30:23,stocks,"Automatic exercise is automatic. The Options Clearing Corporation (like the DTCC but for options) do it for ITM options if they aren't explicitly told not to by your broker, who you have to instruct.

And the assumption is that you will take the shares (for a call) or will give up the shares (for a put), because that's the nature of an options contract. Again, you have to instruct your broker when you want to do something different (the OCC dgaf about your share trades).

Your broker can do a ""cashless exercise"" (aka ""turn and burn"") when this happens, meaning they exercise the options and trade the shares immediately, and just hand you the proceeds. But, yes, you have to tell them to do that.

So the default is to exercise every ITM contract and leave you with a cash or share debit you have to deal with by settlement.

Because it is legal to trade without sufficient funds in the account and deposit the funds before the settlement period ends, they don't take your insufficient funds as an indication you won't cover the shares.

TL;DR: Don't assume things will go the way you expect unless you've seen them go that way before, or you've carefully read the rules of everyone with a finger in the transaction."

For me, here is my plan. I have 70K invested to far, and i am planning to add around 2K per month to the stock market. A realistic goal is 10% returns, and according to my calculations, this should be worth about 600K in 10 years.


At this point, i will be considering either to retire early, or go through a few more years to become really comfortable financially. For example, as a canadian, i'd like to spend the worst winter months in Mexico resorts. I am not very interested in luxurious cars or houses.

So I currently own shares of Virgin Galactic and I am considering buying Rocket Lab as well when it goes public.   Both companies are a pure space play: VirginGalactic focusing on space tourism with a horizontal take off like a plane and Rocket Lab with sending vertical rockets to space with satellite payloads.  They are also working on a rocket to compete with Space X Falcon 9.  

VirginGalactic has a lot of popularity and is more well known, however rocket lab appears to be better in several ways then VirginGalactic.  Better in leadership, financially, execution, and engineering. However I understand that is certainly up for debate.

Virgin Galactic is adorable, for a theme park ride. If they can franchise it and keep insurance costs down, I'd go in on it.

Blue Origin will succeed but you can't buy them.

SpaceX, as derpy as they are, are a market darling, and I'd trade the F out of the fanboi swings as Starship keeps literally blowing up their profit potential. But you can't buy them.

BA/LMT/NG all bury their rocket biz under a mountain of conglomerate rubble. They're disruptive competition, but not usable as a space trade.

Every time someone talks about TQQQ they only have negative things to say and they don't talk about it like regular long term investments. There are quite literally zero backtests that treat it as a long term investment. With a long term investment you pick a fund or a few funds, buy in and then consistently put money in no matter what the market is doing. But no one seems to acknowledge that if you chose to use the same strategy with TQQQ, even with it's exorbitantly high volatility, it will ALWAYS out perform a regular LT investment.

Instead when people talk about TQQQ they talk about it the exact opposite way that you're supposed to use the stock market; they try to time the market. ""Leveraged ETF's shouldn't be held for more than a day"" they say. So let me show you what the data says when you continually invest every month no matter what the market is doing for 10 years. 

This is simply analyzing TQQQ, starting with $1000 and putting in 200 every month. Obviously you probably don't want to hold 100% TQQQ and common advice is to put in 10% of your income. 200/month is 10% of your income if you make 24k a year. Whereas the average income for individuals in the us is 31k (3100 a year invested) and the average household income in the US is 68k (6800 a year invested). I will post adjusted numbers for that over 10 years at the bottom.

http://imgur.com/gallery/RlbXBAN

Over 10 years TQQQ would return 19,237% ROI despite dropping more than 50% 3 times over the course of the 10 years. QQQ, with a downside of no more than 17% returned 3,461% in the same time frame. That is the equivalent of 5.5x greater return than QQQ.

And if you want to talk about trading psychology we can do that too. To continue to hold even in a downturn of over 50% just look at the percentage gain over the life of the investment. The investment could lose 96% of it's value (which is incredibly unlikely) and you would still have more than you initially invested. I mean in a bear market most people just distance themselves from the market and just continue to buy despite what's happening in the market anyways.

Do I think this investment strategy is for everyone? No. Its clearly not. But I'm 25, I have 40 years until I need this money anyways. Its definitely not for the feint of heart and if you can't manage your thoughts and emotions in a downturn then stick with regular, low risk etfs. But I can tell you this, the NASDAQ is mostly tech and tech is not going anywhere. Also market indexes are some of the only assets that can and will quite literally grow forever. Over time wealth redistributes; as larger companies die or are split up, smaller company's come up and take their place and indexes pick up these new stocks to continue to grow. 

TLDR: the NASDAQ isn't going anywhere, tech will continue to grow, the backtests show that higher volatility (while significantly more stressful) is very much a good thing if the asset maintains value despite fluctuations.

Other results for average incomes:
1,000 initial investment, 259/month 32,080 total invested, 608,561 10y return
1,000 initial investment, 568/month 68,040 total invested, 1,261,642 10y return"

2021-04-11 14:29:53,stocks,"What is the condition that kills TQQQ?

Levered funds can go to 0 long before the underlying does. A triple-levered fund should get there with a one-day 33.4% drop in QQQ, theoretically.

But it's not a mathematical formula.  The leverage is done with derivatives, and those can swing a lot more or a lot less than the underlying. Especially in a crash situation the derivative can get illiquid and tank way faster than the 3X implies, and take the fund with it.  QQQ can have a 15% flash crash, its options book could empty out, and TQQQ could bounce off zero.

The issuer usually has a trigger that shuts down the fund if something like that happens. Something like, ""if TQQQ drops 90% in one day we halt it and redeem what's left, if anything is left."""
2021-04-11 14:40:01,stocks,"That's not how the decay works. Everything in the market would be on a perpetual death-spiral if it was just ""minus 10% plus 10% is only 99%.""

The decay happens because the leverage is created by trading options, which have time value, which declines continuously.

As old options are sold and new ones bought, the fund gets paid for small time-values but has to buy large-time values. It's a rolling state called ""being in Contango"" (yes, it's a silly word; the word for selling big while buying small is Backwardation; I shit you not; old-timey option traders were sardonic hipster cowboy snake-oil salesmen)."
2021-04-10 21:20:16,stocks,"I was 5. But buy, keep buying and holding beats the dot com crash. Its just psychology my man. Indices go up. It may take a while but they do eventually reach ATHs."

Not true. 99.9% drawdown means your dollar buys 1000% more equity. DCA saves the account. Its like the 3rd paragraph in the post."
2021-04-11 15:14:50,stocks,"Everything on the market is like that!  It's simply math: 100% * 10% loss = 90%.  90% * 10% gain = 99% of the original price.  This is the definition of volatility decay, all stocks and ETFs experience it, no matter if they are 0.5x leverage, 1x leverage, or 3x leverage.   3x experience to a much greater degree.

TQQQ does not own options.  TQQQ owns stock in each of the QQQ components, swaps with a 10+ major banks, a futures position in the NASDAQ 100.  It does not experience time decay in the sense that options do because futures don't have a strike prices.  The bank swaps insure that the futures position maintains an appropriate daily leverage.  

Any change is not because of time decay in holdings of TQQQ, the bank swaps make sure of that.  I understand contango and backwardation, I trade UVXY where that's a key concept, but those aren't a factor in the price of TQQQ at all.  

TQQQ decay is no joke: average annual return for the past 10 years is 47.65%, which is only 2.4x the average annual return for QQQ over the past 10 years (19.92%).   It's not 3x because of the decay I talked about, but the return of QQQ is also affected by that decay just to a lesser extent since it's only 1x leverage."
2021-04-11 14:45:52,stocks,Investing in more when it's down doesn't cure the losses on the first buy. It just covers them up.
2021-04-10 21:26:44,stocks,You're preaching to the choir. Unfortunately that only applies over the long-term and doesn't always work for leveraged ETFs.
2021-04-11 15:49:19,stocks,"Contango was invented for futures. The rate charged for swaps is continuous rent; it's actually based on volatility, and is basically an amortization of the contango.

Volatility doesn't cause decay in value unless you're rolling purchases of holdings that are time-limited and priced based on volatility.

For equities the pricing is independent of volatility (literally, price is an independent variable in the definition of volatility). So you can't say that volatility drives the price and play the 10% game. As I said, the entire market would be continuously on an exponential decay to oblivion if that applied. That's the opposite of its long-term behavior, so it's not a valid hypothesis."
2021-04-10 21:33:27,stocks,If qqq went down 20% tomorrow there would be a lot of things they could do before the fund gets disbanded. Not to mention qqq going down 20% in a single day would be nothing short of an economic crisis that would cause a lot more problems than just TQQQ going down 60%.

In an extreme case let‚Äôs say you DCAed every week into TQQQ in 2021. You would have fucked yourself pretty bad. 

The answer though to leveraged funds, is knowing when to recognize a bull market and run with it, and when to get out. If you DCAed the runup from March 2020 you would have made a lot of money. Then when treasuries started to rock the markets just take all your money out and eat the taxes."

2021-04-10 23:03:49,stocks,"I've finally got home and had a chance to look for my TQQQ model.  Can't find it, so I built another with data starting Apr 12, 1999.  

The effect of the dotcom crash depends on the account size compared to the DCA.  If you start with a $2MM account in April 1999 and DCA $1000/month, you would just now be reaching the account high you had in March 2000.   It would take until March 2017 to re-attain the $2MM size.

A modest $100k account would have recovered that amount by 2006, but would take until 2014 to retake the dotcom high with a $1000/month DCA.

If your TQQQ portfolio is small compared to your DCA amount, you may not need to worry about protecting against a market crash.  The larger your account is, the more difficult it is to recover and the more you need to employ defensive trading techniques."
2021-04-10 23:10:26,stocks,That is some excellent news. I'm very poor so that's me. But someone else suggested lifecycle investing and I think you might be interested in that. Basically it's spending 15 years using leverage (in the model its 2x leverage vs 3x but still) and it's 70/30 or even 60/40 with a leveraged bond etf. To protect from downside. It requires you to rebalance every quarter but it's very effective. I ran those numbers and it was very very similar in performance to the 100% tqqq account that I posted about. Check it out I think it's awesome that some yale economists have already been talking about this and using it effectively with several years of DD on the matter.

2021-04-11 00:00:00,stocks,"EXPI: eXp World Holdings, Inc. Question about wording from shareholders meeting vote article. Position: 25@$49 average

Hey, all! Pardon my likely simple question, but I did't know how to google this. Item from the shareholders meeting ballot states:

4. Approve an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, $0.00001 par value per share, from 220,000,000 to 900,000,000.

Board Recommendation: **For**

***In the proxy statement, the board states:***

""Although the Company has no current plans to use the additional shares that are proposed to be authorized by the Authorized Shares Amendment, the Board believes that the amendment will benefit the Company and its stockholders by enhancing our ability to consider and respond to opportunities that require the issuance of shares of common stock.""

***Potential effect on stock:***

""If the proposed Authorized Shares Amendment is approved by our stockholders, the additional authorized shares of common stock would have rights identical to our currently outstanding common stock. Future issuances of shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, book value per share and the voting interest and power of current stockholders since holders of common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights.""

So, question being: what do you see moving forward adding 680,000,000 shares? Though they may not necessarily release them now, I can't imagine they'll hold on to them forever. I see a potential for a large dilution, and that is a shame. As things stand now, I believe they are significantly undervalued and I would add to my position if I could - they dipped with the tech disaster of March and haven't regained their momentum. However, simply sitting in that number of issued shares is shaking my confidence in their prospectus as a shareholder. What do you think?"

Hence, how vulnerable is the market to other similar situations?"
2021-04-11 08:16:32,stocks,"They weren't talking advantage of loopholes. They were committing banking fraud by not telling lenders about their true liabilities.

In a Total Return Swap, you rent stock. You pay a periodic constant amount and you receive the gains or pay the losses. These payments can flow into and out of your account daily.

The periodic amount is small. It's an estimate of the gain expected over the life of the agreement. So only a percentage of the share price. Because of that, your cash goes a lot father. You can rent far more shares than you could buy at once. This creates leverage. Investing a dollar gets many times returns that buying would; but also risks many times the losses.

To prove you can cover the risk you put your real holdings up as collateral. If you pledge the same collateral to more than one bank, you can make the same agreements with them all and multiply your leverage more.

But when your biggest position tanks, it only takes a small move to wipe your your collateral value and cause margin calls. And of course since you're levered way beyond your wealth those will fail, and the people you're renting the shares from will start eating the real losses in the share price, which they expected you to cover. They hate that, and will panic-sell the shares to get away from the remaining risk.

I don't know why the news isn't paying more attention to how incredibly stupid the banks were not to check how many times this guy's collateral was promised to others.

Two very senior executives at Credit Suisse got fired immediately for it. There should be blood on the walls at the other banks, too.

And the SEC and other financial organizations should be invading the banks looking for what must be an industry of this sort of excessive leveraging of swap agreements."
2021-04-10 20:27:00,stocks,"Ol billy boy had $10 bil in cash running a family fund. Problem with a family office is that you can‚Äôt take in outside investment money which really hampers how much capital you can raise, how much gains you can make and how much clout you have on the street. 

So he went to four different banks and took out about $70 bil in leverage and didn‚Äôt notify them about what he owed each other (because family offices don‚Äôt have to disclose this I guess). Then he targeted sleepy stocks and pumped the shit out of them to trigger short squeezes and attract momo retail traders into those same stocks. Unfortunately some of them, GSX in particular, turned out to be total frauds. Edit: others like Viacom did offerings which lowered the value of his positions too. This led to huge losses and the banks then became aware that he owed a ton of money to other firms.

You can‚Äôt replicate this unless you have billions on your own and want to leverage 7:1 (idiotic to do). What‚Äôs scary is that he is definitely not the only one doing this and the crazy valuations in speculative companies right now is likely driven by this margin debt pumping.

Both of these things can be true. It's a historical certainty that there *will* be a crash (or two or three) by the end of the decade. That doesn't mean we won't still hit 10k by 2030. At some point in this decade we'll probably see a 20 - 30% crash happen. That's just how the cycles work. But over the long run, we'll see an increase. Welcome to Stonks 101."

I know a lot of people are doom and gloom on us dollar but I think if that happens the global economic collapse would be so intense no one would care about gold, we would go back to the original system of bartering goods and services for other goods and services. Gold is a pretty much useless thing in an apocalypse save for us tech heads who can use it in some circuits.

So far nobody has predicted an unrecoverable market crash.

Inflation ebbs and flows.  Borrowers win, lenders lose, in high inflation times.  It‚Äôs a well understood boogeyman, but the game is RIGGED. 

It‚Äôs more a matter of when and how you step off the ride.  Some people stay on the ride to the end, some step off and glide, some step on and off and on and off.

So when these morons post scaremongering ads about the next market crash, that‚Äôs not for the long term investor.  That‚Äôs for the over-leveraged risk addict or hedge fund, one margin call away from losing it all.

Sure their PE ratios are 30+ but they could reasonably safe investments even considering that. There are a lot of dogshit companies (from an investing perspective) who have stupid valuations.

FWIW I think there‚Äôs a ways to go in this bull market, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that lots of unprofitable tech companies with no realistic plan for becoming profitable aren‚Äôt overvalued. Meanwhile there are lots of great industries (like finance) that are fairly valued."

2021-04-11 07:41:51,stocks,"Right, but if there is a crash that affects the s&p it‚Äôs going to affect all stocks. As we have seen during this pandemic our reliance on tech has only increased. Surely this would reinforce my point that at the very least tech is going to be the most insulated part of your portfolio during a pandemic.

Unless you want to start storing money under your bed or potentially more in bonds instead of etfs, but unless you‚Äôre anticipating a drop in the next year and you invest all of your money right now, it seems a bit silly to not invest in the s&p"

2021-04-10 23:30:22,stocks,"Lump-sum investing is the true way, if you're buying and holding. You're buying and holding low cost index funds because you believe equities pay something like 7% real on average over time. Something that is appreciating on average over time is, on average, cheapest now.

DCA might help some people avoid panic selling, but if you've got the constitution to not sell when there's a dip, there's more money in just buying immediately.

2021-04-10 23:44:34,stocks,"But this is only based on you only invest 1% of your cash each month and left 99% in your portfolio. If you invest more % let‚Äôs say 90% and only left 10% in cash, the result would be different.

And there are 4 personal reasons why DCA should be better:

1) we never know if the stock is actually going to be great and the investment might end up as a disaster at the end, so the downside risk is more protected with DCA then lump sum.

2) Even lot of people said we hold it until it moon or rocket up, but realistically, how many proportions of people can do that? We said that because we still haven‚Äôt seen a huge market crash, like the stock price back to pre-pandemic, if it ever happened. The Feb semi-crash with 40% down is not valid because many overhyped stocks with no actual profit actually ten-fold or just double before.

3) it actually makes you being able to collect stocks with cheaper price in case there were any down years few years in a row after crash, so your stock price actually can be lower than the lump sum. Ofc the amount you earn is less than lump sum in case the stock keep going up coz the average price will be higher as well.

4) With relatively more cash on hand with DCA, you can actually purchase other stocks with the spare cash and have less opportunity cost waiting to bounce back in case the one stock you have confidence in happened to plummet.

Idk if I am right, but that‚Äôs just my opinion haha."
2021-04-10 20:07:48,stocks,"That‚Äôs not what I said either. 

I said that, long term, tech is a safe bet unless something really shit happens to the point where you don‚Äôt care about stocks. Like a carrington event. As most of your money invested in stocks is itself stored in tech, there will always be a demand for it. It‚Äôs a good investment.

Of course there will be downturns - every market goes bearish - but tech seems to be the safest investment.

This shouldn‚Äôt replace responsible investment strategy. Don‚Äôt dump everything into S&P right now but dollar cost averaging into it is a pretty good bet."

2021-04-10 20:30:56,stocks,Yeah the slight difference won't matter too much in the long run and is definitely better than waiting until now. All depends what you invested in too. SP500 on the first investing day of the 2021 was the lowest it's closed all year. But mathematically if you invest early in the year every year you'll end up doing better in the long run which is what you said your goal is. Keep at it
2021-04-11 00:18:11,stocks,"Talk of ""to the moon"" and the like makes me think you're not talking about long term buy and hold investing (I'm a devotee of buy and hold low cost total market index ETFs) which I was restricting my advice to. If you're doing long term buy and hold, the right time to buy is now. Anything else is market timing."

2021-04-10 20:24:04,stocks,So 5% annual interest rate on a stock market with 5% expected returns on current valuations (and that‚Äôs optimistic). Great deal for Schwab.
2021-04-11 12:22:13,stocks,"It works until it doesn't, and when it doesn't you lose your money twice as fast and they lose nothing.

And you pay high interest rates for the privilege."

2021-04-10 23:22:00,stocks,Er? Iv? Can you help a newer investor out?
2021-04-11 14:13:42,stocks,Especially since their risk is zero. They take their capital back when margin equity drops to 30%. Plenty of room left there. Their risk of ruin is 0% but they're getting 5% IRR.
2021-04-10 20:41:14,stocks,"Yeah, I‚Äôm going to try and negotiate a better rate and then pay off my positions sooner than originally planned. Still think I can beat 5% though üòâ"
2021-04-11 13:09:43,stocks,"No. No no no. Read that page closer.

If ""Cash and borrowing"" is under ""To trade"" it's the amount of stock you can buy by taking on debt until you reach the initial margin requirement for the trade.

If it's under ""to withdraw"" it's the amount you can borrow from the broker and take from the account entirely until what is left is stock and debt at the maintenance margin requirement for the holdings.

But you have 0 cash. Only in transient conditions will you ever have both cash and debt in a single account.

So those numbers are the max debt you can add to your existing debt by buying something now.

You are at 100/120 = 83% margin.

The maintenance limit is probably 30%, so to get a call the price would have to drop until the debt is 70% of the total value, so the value would be 20k/.7 = 28,572, which is a drop of 76.2%.

Remember the only thing that reduces the debt is putting cash in the account, either by deposit or by selling something. So only 8,572 of that is yours. While the total value is dropping by 76.2%, your money is losing 91.4% and the broker is making several percent interest and will close you out as soon as it starts to see an actual risk."
2021-04-10 23:58:13,stocks,"Even if I get margin called, I just sell some of my stable stocks until the volatile stocks recover.  I also have a lot of value/dividend stock that pretty much minimizes the interest."

2021-04-10 21:35:01,stocks,One thing I wanted to add: Either bring your interest costs way down or invest A LITTLE into a leveraged ETF or do what I do: zero leverage on stocks.
2021-04-10 20:43:53,stocks,Good luck then.

2021-04-11 13:17:21,stocks,"Thanks for the math there. That‚Äôs, ballpark, what I figured. That I would need to have that steep of a drop to get margin called w 16% of my portfolio on margin.

2021-04-11 14:07:42,stocks,Schwab's margin stats are a mystery. I can never make them add up cleanly.  Even simple stuff like doubling up the whole account doesn't match the buying power they show. It's off by a goofy number like 11 or 12%.

2021-04-10 21:04:58,stocks,"It‚Äôs part of the game. This risk explains the returns you get with stocks, it‚Äôs compensation for the risk. No return without risk. Generally it is advised to have an investment horizon of at least 10 years so you can sit out a recession. After 15 years your winrate approaches 100% historically. 

The game is heavily in your favor as long as you don‚Äôt leave the game or fall out of it to soon. (Like panic selling, margin calls, unexpected payments...)

I really like to quote John Bogle here: ‚ÄûBuy everything and hold it forever.‚Äú

2021-04-10 23:13:17,stocks,"ELI5:

They earn interest on the money they funded the pension fund with. They put enough money in the fund so that in X years they will pay the right amount. The more interest they can earn, the less cash they have to have in the account now, to cover the payment in the future.

Except they play a game.

There is (probably) no account. They just designate a portion of their assets as belonging to the pension fund, based on current interest rates and the future value they expect to owe. That's reported as an obligation, instead of as liquid assets.

Since the interest rate changed, the amount they have to designate as an obligation also changes. The rate went up so they need to obligate less money to cover the future payments, freeing up more money to spend on other things. But no cash flowed anywhere, so it's a non-cash gain."

2021-04-10 22:13:58,stocks,"Inflation doesn't prevent people from meeting fixed income obligations, it makes it easier as fixed income isn't inflation adjusted. You are correct that yields do go up, but what does that do to the price of existing bonds? Well they go down, a lot. You can use tools like https://portfoliotoolbox.com/bond-pricing.html to visualise this.

Essentially as bond yields go up all existing bonds at lower coupon rates quickly lose their value. So this is one important factor, bond price moves are big in relation to yields. The second really important factor has to do with the bond market itself which is the amount of leverage normally applied. This is partially what led to the massive pop in bond yields in February (which I think in turn was caused by China signalling tightening). Long story short someone unwound a massive bond position, approximately $40B and they do so very very quickly. Tons of traders in the bond market had very leveraged trades betting on yields staying low. These guys got wiped out so with those trades also unwinding it set off a massive rout in the global bond market.

Thing is that is just the start. If you think pricing back from 0.6 to 1.6 was painful wait until you see yields reprice from 1.6 to 2.5 or higher while temporary inflation prints are 4%+. Smart people know that inflation is likely transitory but bond vigilantes don't give a shit.
If we see a massive yield spike that causes a much bigger global sell-off in bonds that central banks aren't able to stabilize then it will be very very bad.

It does not make sense to stay fully invested blindly when the market is seriously overvalued by such aggregate measures.

2021-04-10 20:54:00,stocks,"> Didn‚Äôt say how you got to $40 from $42.

The original article was a Seeking Article valuation article.

The author did a $42 valuation on the entire company, which I disagree with for two reasons.

The $2 deduction is based on [spinning out Porsche to raise funds for EV spending](https://www.carscoops.com/2021/03/porsche-has-explored-possibility-of-public-offering-exec-says/).

> VW will need to spend >$86 billion

So?  They already spent $50 billion of the total.

> VW doesn‚Äôt have the charging network, the solar, the battery capacity, the power walls, or the autonomous driving. It will be behind.

That's why it's building its own charging network and establishing a uniform battery format for its EVs.

> Dealerships don‚Äôt want to sell their EV‚Äôs

So?  That same article states that they're moving to a centralized model:

""By centralizing their sales efforts, they can sell cars online without relying on their evidently intransigent dealerships. This will hopefully make the sales experience less stressful for shoppers. But owners will still have access to VW‚Äôs large dealer network for service and support post-sale, which is a real benefit.""

> No clue where you are getting those forecasted 2020 EV sales data or why it‚Äôs relevant. You don‚Äôt make any point about it.

2020 data is straight from their annual report.

> Make sure to deduct the likely $100b from your refined calculation for the EV buildout cost. And make sure you lower your net profit if you‚Äôre doing any sort of weighted pricing because Vw margins will shrink as they split the difference with dealerships.

Why?  Capex is not a reduction of enterprise value.

My valuation of VW's EV business is based strictly on *sales*, as should always be the case with disruptive technology.  Margin is irrelevant, let alone profits.

Unless you're talking about something like net sales, then that might be a different conversation, but net sales /= net margin.

> You forgot to deduct the ICE sales in your 10 bagger hahahahah.

Why deduct?  It should be added.

ICE and hybrid sales are valued based on the usual P/E metrics, hence the ""value play"" of ‚Ç¨172.6 billion for ICE + Hybrid - Porsche.

How much does the charging network cost. Is that caped forecasted already? Not cheap. 


So? What if that network doesn‚Äôt take off or is changed because it‚Äôs just one late entrant and doesn‚Äôt fit with the other networks. 


So? Do you think that could perhaps frustrate users with few charging or various charging services? So?


So? What about dealer agreements and incentive to sell? Does VW CFO sell cars or doesnVw dealer? So? Maybe that hurts sales? So? Sales are dollars which means 9 bagger lol not 20 bags! 


So 


You know what is an EV reduction? Debt. You know what debt is? So? Money. So. That‚Äôs money needed for capex. So. Reduces ev.

So? That means only 8 baggerbbb!!!!

How many ICE vehicles can fuel the sale of a single EV?  That is the better question.

So his example in Op 1000 ops x 100 x 0.50 = $50,000 market value. 


> Equity Options. To calculate the volume of equity options for purposes of Rule 13h-1, the number of contracts should be multiplied by the applicable multiplier. For example, 500 contracts x 100 shares of the underlying per contract = 50,000 shares.


Op example is 100,000 shares.

2021-04-11 17:58:05,stocks,"It seems I don't meet the requirements per the FAQ on the SEC website:


Volume Calculation


Equity Options. To calculate the volume of equity options for purposes of Rule 13h-1, the number of contracts should be multiplied by the applicable multiplier. For example, 500 contracts x 100 shares of the underlying per contract = 50,000 shares.


Index Options. Volume does not need to be calculated for index options.


Fair Market Value Calculation


Equity Options. Subsequent to the Adopting Release (34-64976), where the value of equity options was to be calculated by using the value of the securities underlying the option, the Commission issued an Exemptive Order (34-76322) to permit equity options to be valued using premium paid. Accordingly, the fair market value of equity options may be calculated based on the premium paid for the option. The following example shows how to calculate the value of an equity option using premium paid:


An investor a person purchases 200 call options on ABC stock, each with a 100 multiplier, for a premium of $15 per share. The fair market value of the options trade would be calculated as follows: 200 contracts x 100 shares per contract x $15 premium price = $300,000.


Index Options. The following example shows how to calculate the value of an index option:


An investor purchases 100 put contracts on an index for $51.00 per unit, at a strike price of 1375, and where the option uses a 100 multiplier. The value of these index options for purposes of Rule 13h-1 would be $510,000, calculated as follows: 100 contracts x $51.00 price per unit x $100 contract multiplier = $510,000."

Apple has transferred all China's user's data to a facility located physically in China, which is a smart move to show some obedience. Zuckerberg criticizes China a lot, but back in 2010 when Facebook almost got a license in China he did a big show by jogging in Tiananmen Square. Huge investors would do anything for money. 

I think China and the US, especially the Democratic authority, know perfectly what are political moves for show and what are real business to keep. Most political actions or retaliations are demonstrative and serve their internal purposes only.

Rocket Mortgage is a spinoff of Quicken Loans, so its bones have been around since the dotcom days. It was owned by Dan Gilbert, the guy who bought the Cleveland Cavaliers and had all that drama with LeBron James.

He had a stroke a couple of years ago, and his family have been in charge since then.

They decided to spin Rocket Mortgage to the public, but demand was weak and they had to cut the size of it. They undercut the market by a little, but the current price is right about where the market had it then. Not great given the performance of everything else.

They have a loan servicing business, naturally, but they claim they're turning it into a real estate and RE financing cloud service, which smells like a big overreach.

Copper, the current mines supplying the world are running low, and there isnt enough of them to begin with. By 2030 there is said to be a 10 billion ton defecit. Currently the biggest copper mine under construction in over 100 years is said to fill 2% of that defecit.

Why? In history all the major countries in the world went through their industrialization at different times.

Now, the entire world is making a push for green energy at the same time. And there isnt enough copper to go around.

NOVR has forseen this and had been aquiring royalties on strategic copper mines that will be supplying the forefront of this copper defecit since 2018. Do some DD but i think NOVR is going to be a huge payoff one day and they also said they plan to pay dividends one day.

2021-04-11 03:11:25,stocks,"This is probably not going to be a popular opinion, but its the truth.  
There is a political narrative about executive compensation and workers wages etc, and I'm not at all here to debate that.  

The more money your job produces, the more money the company can afford to pay you.   Seems pretty basic, but its a simple equation.  Your job has to produce a multiple of your gross pay, or its cheaper to NOT hire you.  

Now, factor in the number of people that are qualified and capable of performing your job, and the fewer people that can do it means those that can, can charge a premium.  

For example Top NFL QBs make $40m a year.   Are they worth $40m as a person...probably not.  
They're in extremely high demand, because there are realistically about 10-15 people in the world capable of being a top tier NFL QB.   
Being a highly successful QB means your team wins more games, gets better ratings, and generates HUNDREDS of millions of dollars for the organization. At the end of the day, its worth paying them that much money because they make 10x that for their team.  

The same goes for executives.  

Yum brands for example. In 2019, their CEO [made $16m](https://www1.salary.com/Greg-Creed-Salary-Bonus-Stock-Options-for-YUM-BRANDS-INC.html).   
His salary was just over a million (about 6% of his gross pay), with the rest of his salary coming in bonuses, stock options, company shares, and other benefits.  
More than 90% of his pay is based off of how well the company does and the stock price.  The company had net profits of 1.9B, and spent another Billion on dividends to investors.  

As a shareholder, YOU ABSOLUTELY want the executive board to have a compensation package like this.  They have skin in the game, and if the stock doesn't do well, they make less money.   If they deliver results, they get a small % the company profits (0.8% in this case)


Don't get caught up in the narrative.  Fairness or pay equality is irrelevant (from an investment perspective).  As a share holder, you should only care that the company is making profits, growing, and delivering you a solid dividend or return.   CEO pay isn't going to move the needle."

1. Investing in crypto exchange capitalizes on market transactions. As long as people trade, the exchange will grow no matter the price of Bitcoin.

The reason there's value in this, even if you aren't beating the market right now, is that one day, you're going to find a company in that sweet spot of growth, and it's going to make all the sense in the world to you that this company will grow. A lot. And then you'll be ready to confidently throw a disproportionate percentage of your portfolio into that company. And THAT is the play that will take you to meaningful market gains. 

When you have that level of experience and trust in yourself, and you find that company, you'll just know it. 

For me, jumping into MWK just before Christmas for 200 shares @ 15.37 turned out to be the play that helped me realize that I can really trust myself.

- Believe it or not, but there's still too much negativity about the market and there's still too many people that think VIX products are going to ""go to the moon"".

- XLI apparently has many stocks that just broke out of a 2 year base and the Dow Transports have been on absolute fire, and both imply further upside in the Dow. I'd be shocked if it doesn't rest at some point but another 10-15% here in the end should not be ruled out at all, it did it in 2017 and 2019, so why not on it doing it again."

Thoughtful tax hikes for the benefit of the population at large create a temporary tax burden that makes everyone think it's done in an effort to tear down the free market, but is actually beneficial in the long term, much the way people don't actually enjoy the feeling of diet or exercise, but recognize it as a necessary evil for big-picture health.

However, ""Fuck the poors in order to put corporate bottom lines on steroids"" is not good for the economy, because markets /= economy. It has a temporary benefit to markets that is not meaningful or sustainable. 

In the long run, the better off the population as a whole is, the better off corporate america, markets, and the economy will be. This means stuff like poverty and infrastructure (for poor people too) and equality are long-term benefits.

Trump did none of this, so nothing he did was a sustainable or sound policy. It was screwing people over out of spite in a policy strictly comprised of ""fuck you I got mine."""

Completely false. Forcing is penalizing someone for not seeing it your way. Influencing is attempting to help them see on their own that it's in their own self-interest to freely make the decision for themselves.

Until the Biden admin initiates a foreign policy action (pulls funding, levies sanctions, etc), they're not attempting to force, they're attempting to influence. 

That's the difference between genuine leadership/credibility and pitching a whiny bitch fit.
