2021-04-28 19:49:30,stocks,Yeah outside of Yahoo mail I dont use Yahoo for anything else. I use to visit Yahoo daily but I dont think I've seen or read a Yahoo article in a few years. Verizon needs to get the ball rolling on ATSC3.0 updates and make sure data is there for it when 3.0 is fully available across the country.
2021-04-28 19:38:25,stocks,Couldn't agree more.
2021-04-28 19:39:35,stocks,I see your point but you should be doing your own DD regardless which would let you know what they do and who their competition is
2021-04-28 19:50:03,stocks,Why does it matter when the point of those posts is too often just to pump a stock?
2021-04-28 19:57:39,stocks,[removed]
2021-04-28 19:46:31,stocks,"Of course I am doing my own DD, it is not one or the other..  I really don't want a full explanation. Just a super brief explanation. In the example I gave (UWMC), OP could have said:

""My DD of UWMC (United Wholesale Mortgage Company)....""

and that is all I need to get the context of most of the DD. That is all I ask for :)"

2021-04-28 19:07:07,stocks,"If you‚Äôre talking about taking out a P2P loan and using the loan funds to invest, that seems like a terrible idea.

You‚Äôd have to have a guaranteed return equal to whatever the interest rate on the loan is (I haven‚Äôt looked at the P2P rates in a while but I‚Äôd assume even with top tier credit it‚Äôs at least 4-5%) just to break even on the deal.

There is no guarantee that VTI will outperform that over a 36 or 60 month period.

And you will have to make monthly payments back against the loan anyway, so that has to come from somewhere - either out of pocket or from the original funds you invested.

There‚Äôs just rarely an instance where it makes sense to take a loan to turn around and invest those funds.

If your talking about something else entirely, my apologies for the confusion."
2021-04-28 18:57:31,stocks,"Personally, I've never thought it intelligent to invest anything other than funds that you already have and can afford to lose, since nothing is truly ""guaranteed.""  Just my two cents, though...  The concept sounds interesting, but I always fall between the pessimist and the realist on this type of thing."
2021-04-28 19:05:33,stocks,What are the interest rates on peer to peer lending? I imagine they are higher than standard interest rates
2021-04-28 19:09:59,stocks,"If you think the returns on VTI will be greater than the interest paid on the loan than go for it. 

Or... and this is my solid recomendation, don't put yourself in high-interest debt at all and just buy VTI gradually in-lieu of the loan payments."
2021-04-28 19:26:35,stocks,you crushed my idea but yeah thanks for the explanation
2021-04-28 19:03:17,stocks,"I think VTI and some other strong index funds are very safe in the long term 

Its the whole idea that you can use someones else's money to make you money thats attracting me"
2021-04-28 19:51:17,stocks,"Sorry. I don‚Äôt want to be in the dream crushing business, but just trying to be realistic here."
2021-04-28 19:13:32,stocks,"True, but I imagine you'd need to convince the ""lender"" as well.  What's in it for them may not be worth it to them at the % you earn, minus the profit that you're looking to keep.  I'm not stock whiz or anything, but if you're steadily gaining 3% and you offer them half at 1.5%:  A.  Why don't they just invest it themselves for the full 3%, in the same fund?  B.  I suppose they'd have to be a long term investor to make the ""safe"" gains worth something, ya know?   Not trying to rain on your parade or anything, it just seems difficult, unless you're willing to go super risky and can afford the loss (due to the high risk, of course), to make a worth-while gain that you could sell to the lending side of this deal."
2021-04-28 18:34:13,stocks,"IMO yes. You can typically squeeze out higher rev/margin when demand goes up, and increase your original margin when supply comes back up to speed."
2021-04-28 18:29:17,stocks,There‚Äôs another story unfolding and that is the nationalization of the chip industry.
2021-04-28 19:02:00,stocks,"IMO no, not even short term.

Semis by and large don't require the latest and greatest manufacturing processes for their electronics.  The squeeze right now is on high end chips made with the latest of fabrication processes.  There are still plenty of plants out there that aren't running at capacity spinning the types of chips needed for a semi.

The reason the auto manufacturing industry is getting squeezed is because they are grabbing these higher end chips for things like their infotainment and driver assist capabilities.  Most semis don't come with infotainment systems."
2021-04-28 19:05:06,stocks,"As I understand it, it is not really a shortage in the conventional sense.  It is not like semiconductor manufacturers cannot source enough silicon wafers or whatever.  During Covid a lot of industries expected radically lower demand for their products for a long time.  They cut back on their chip orders.  Other companies, like consumer electronics, took up the slack.  Now companies like auto companies are facing a huge surge in demand but they don't have the contracts to obtain the chips they need.  Chip production capacity is the same.  It is just that certain industries fumbled their predictions for what they would need.

Unless a manufacturer has spare production capacity, like they are running two shifts when they could be running three, I am not sure how much revenue and earnings will be immediately affected.  I imagine there will be a premium for future contracts as companies scramble to secure their future supply chain."
2021-04-28 19:20:51,stocks,They're already priced in since JAN-FEB anyways so don't expect huge price increases. Actually Semis are overpriced atm.
2021-04-28 18:51:39,stocks,"Long term you'll be fine. Short term, it's pretty much priced in.  TXN announced a beat on earnings and guidance. It fell -4% today. (It's at a pretty lofty price though).  I bought SMH at the 1st of the year. Down -2%.  Semis are my largest holdings."
2021-04-28 19:15:15,stocks,Could you elaborate i can barely read
2021-04-28 19:40:09,stocks,"Not happening.  The most you can expect is something similar to the auto industry where government policies, taxes, and tariffs are used to ""encourage"" companies to manufacture domestically.

More likely we will see handouts to large companies that are already making billions of dollars a year and don't need taxpayer money.  Example: Not long ago Intel decided to buy back $10B of its own stock.  This is not a company that needs a handout.  But watch politicians pat themselves on the back for giving one.  Companies like INTC will benefit from this waste of taxpayer money, and by buying INTC you may be able to get a small piece of it yourself."
2021-04-28 19:20:12,stocks,Are you talking about semi trucks or the semiconductor industry?
2021-04-28 19:42:23,stocks,I was talking about semiconductors lmao sorry I forgot semitrucks were a thing
2021-04-28 19:25:18,stocks,"Not related to your point in any way, but I'm glad to see someone mention TXN. All it has done or the last 5+ years is outperform yet it gets next to no attention"
2021-04-28 19:33:59,stocks,"Lol, semi trucks!

That said, talking about the semiconductor industry, I'd see a bump on TSMC and Samsung.  Others like global foundries, micron, etc, not so much.  Other than cutting edge manufacturing, there isn't a chip squeeze."
2021-04-28 19:51:49,stocks,"Lol, Your first comment makes more sense now. 

I would also argue that unless you believe the shortage is permanent the shortage is priced into almost every chip stock. I still like many chip companies long term, but this isn‚Äôt a reason to get in."
2021-04-28 19:31:18,stocks,"Amazing to me how $SHOP was hyped to the gills on Reddit before GME.  

Reports a monster quarter; stock is up double digits % and no one is talking about it LOL.

Thankfully my $SHOP shares just crossed the $100K mark today.  üòá"

2021-04-28 17:25:56,stocks,"Your first mistake is buying a call with expiration one week away.
Your second mistake is spending money on something you know nothing about.

No one knows how the market will change. Based off your comments, it doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôre educated enough on trading to be risking your money. Please do research and maybe look into paper trading before you lose it all."
2021-04-28 17:09:16,stocks,"The best advice I can give you is to please stop using options until you understand them thoroughly, and are supremely confident in your decision making with them. They missed on earnings two days ago, that‚Äôs the only catalyst it looks like you‚Äôll have for a while, and even then they‚Äôre still higher than they were earlier this month."
2021-04-28 17:38:29,stocks,"you got iv crushed, that iv isn't coming back"
2021-04-28 17:03:49,stocks,"I'm not knowledgeable on sbux but I think the problem is how much coffee bean costs rose, so if you like sbux, sca over time. They'll raise prices and stock will go up. Very speculative by me but Starbucks will bounce back eventually."
2021-04-28 17:06:35,stocks,"Trying to play earnings being long options is a bit of a fools errand. Other than the stock going down you get that nice IV crush to go along with it. I mean your odds of making money depend on the strike price and what you paid for a premium. The stock could go up or down; long term I still think SBUX is a winner. Personally I hope it gets crushed, I‚Äôve been looking to pick some up."
2021-04-28 19:51:07,stocks,"A week out, your money is gone.

An option only has two things that gives it any value: time and the intrinsic value (amount the stock is trading above the strike price). If you‚Äôre out of the money, then the intrinsic value is zero. All that‚Äôs left is time and a week out, unless you‚Äôre very close to the strike price, your time value is at or rapidly approaching zero."
2021-04-28 17:52:59,stocks,"Reading through the other comments, I'm going to give you a boring piece of advice..  Stop buying individual stocks and options contracts.  There is no easy money to be made.  Buy ETFs like SPY or mutual funds.  These are huge baskets of stocks.  Market returns beat picking 90% of the time.  Boring, I know, but you're far more likely to make money over the long haul."
2021-04-28 19:08:44,stocks,"I recommend you start with a paper trading account to learn options. Think or swim is one.

This way you can lose money on paper instead of irl."

2021-04-28 17:26:35,stocks,Yeah I've heard a lot about paper trading and I think I will try that out
2021-04-28 17:12:13,stocks,Yeah I'm realizing I went into this sort of blindly. Made $100 on NIO this Monday but didn't sell and ended up at a loss. I need to do more research clearly because I've lost $300 this week and I'm really not in the financial position to be losing that kind of money

2021-04-28 17:08:53,stocks,What strike price and what did you pay? No one knows what the market will do. You very well could lose it all or get some of it back
2021-04-28 17:23:21,stocks,"I know, I just really didn't view this as gambling. I did do a decent amount of research and I thought I was going to make easy money. The day trading restrictions on RH also kind of screwed me over. Didn't know about those."

2021-04-28 17:12:25,stocks,"Dollar cost averaging.

2021-04-28 17:59:05,stocks,"With stocks, you just have to get the direction right. With options, you not only have to get the direction right, but also the correct timeframe of that movement.

2021-04-28 17:24:10,stocks,"the stupidity, amazing. ""I've lost $300 this week and I'm really not in the financial position to be losing that kind of money"".   Why in the hell are you buying options.   its like going to the casino with your rent money."
2021-04-28 17:13:11,stocks,So it's a good time to buy shares? Just trying to make some of my premium back.
2021-04-28 17:16:31,stocks,Yeah you‚Äôre pretty screwed. You need about an 8% move to get your money back. This is the risk you take trading options with a short term expiration.
2021-04-28 18:02:03,stocks,Got it. The YouTube videos are just so enticing and make it look so easy.
2021-04-28 17:25:04,stocks,I watched lots of YouTube videos that discussed how the profit margins are so much greater for options than just regular stocks and I got excited. I realize it was foolish.
2021-04-28 17:17:10,stocks,What about making even just some of my money back? I'm just wondering if there's any point in waiting till next week to sell
2021-04-28 19:41:37,stocks,"Think about it this way. When you buy an option contract, someone else is going selling that contract. When it comes to an option, anything you ""win"", someone else has to have ""lost"". You are a new trader... you are literally the fish that these people are going after to make easy money. It's like being new to Texas Hold'Em."
2021-04-28 17:50:17,stocks,"Yeah, profit potential is higher but so is the loss potential.  Options are 100% not for new investors regardless of what youtube tells you."
2021-04-28 17:21:33,stocks,That‚Äôs a question only you can answer. Looks like you could get a few bucks back at this point. Are you willing to lose the rest of your premium on the small chance it might pay off. That said I think the odds are low considering how big of a move the stock has to make.
2021-04-28 17:51:00,stocks,"Got it, thanks :) Do you offer mentorship?"
2021-04-28 17:24:18,stocks,"I mean I only have $13 left to lose, that's pretty negligible."

2021-04-28 17:25:09,stocks,Yeah at this point that‚Äôs what I would do. Every once and awhile you get lucky.
2021-04-28 17:25:49,stocks,Thanks
2021-04-28 18:53:00,stocks,I think it will rebound back to 115 mid next week and you can sell it to some sucker then to recoup the losses

2021-04-28 17:21:44,stocks,The anti-Apple people have moved to being anti-Tesla.
2021-04-28 16:50:13,stocks,How much is your initial investment worth now?
2021-04-28 17:50:28,stocks,good job boomer
2021-04-28 18:31:30,stocks,They want another 12b beat next quarter lol
2021-04-28 18:04:49,stocks,Does it actually increase price? Or just shrink the PE multiple and the market does the rest?
2021-04-28 18:18:30,stocks,When is the buyback happening?
2021-04-28 19:45:37,stocks,"So if Apple has a 2.0T market cap now at $130 per share, will its market cap at $260 per share be actually < 4.0T because a buyback occurred (since market cap is price x shares outstanding and the buyback reduced shares outstanding)? Been trying to understand this"
2021-04-28 18:56:13,stocks,Do they buy it back at once or over the year?
2021-04-28 18:02:02,stocks,"Also, they don‚Äòt habe to pay dividends on those stocks in the future anymore"
2021-04-28 18:53:47,stocks,By increasing the share price? Is there anyway possible that they do buy backs and the share price actually doesn't go up?
2021-04-28 18:53:06,stocks,I don't think people who are long on tech care about the last week or month. Put everything in msft and AAPL and let it ride.
2021-04-28 16:55:17,stocks,"nice, was a good time to buy"
2021-04-28 17:03:43,stocks,What will you do if it collapses
2021-04-28 19:03:39,stocks,I‚Äôm mad because I bought in at 126 and had an opportunity to buy in under 120 if my damn check cleared. Oh well.
2021-04-28 17:15:30,stocks,Tesla seems to do it just fine without a huge network of dealerships or service centers.
2021-04-28 17:52:36,stocks,How much do I win?
2021-04-28 16:54:10,stocks,"Come on man it's only 150 times your money, you can do so much better in nearly 22 years /s"
2021-04-28 16:50:46,stocks,"Congrats!

They didn't give you shares themselves?"
2021-04-28 16:54:30,stocks,"I only invested $5k which is everything that I had, that is worth about $37k now - but I've been buying more since I started making more money, not as big returns, but I've still done +200% on those."
2021-04-28 18:30:59,stocks,"Not going to lie I have no idea how buybacks affect PE. The only thing I know is that it raises the share price, it gives the shareholder more ownership in the company since less shares on in the market, and it doesnt affect market cap."
2021-04-28 18:44:28,stocks,Between now and April next year they'll buy them back.
2021-04-28 18:27:37,stocks,No idea. I highly doubt its going to be all at once. Typically they do it periodically but this is complete speculation.
2021-04-28 18:02:50,stocks,Or earnings in general.
2021-04-28 18:55:55,stocks,"Tbf, that relative underperformance covers at least the last year of trading as well.

But yea, again, just talking in relation to of late"
2021-04-28 17:04:55,stocks,Cry maybe idk
2021-04-28 17:16:38,stocks,"If Apple collapses you have more than just Apple to worry about.

Apple has 200 billion dollars of cash on hand."
2021-04-28 17:17:19,stocks,"If Apple collapses, money will be the least of my worries."
2021-04-28 17:52:07,stocks,Wait
2021-04-28 19:03:55,stocks,"182,000"
2021-04-28 19:15:09,stocks,Yay I won a silver coin! How nice of y‚Äôall!
2021-04-28 16:52:32,stocks,"That I can't talk about.

I don't think i would have invested if I wasn't working there. But it seemed like a good deal at the time and it got me into personnal finance and investing so it's all good! I recommand to everyone to invest in their companies' ESPP you can't really lose."
2021-04-28 18:44:03,stocks,"There are still only two elements to the P/E ratio, price and earnings. A share buyback doesn't impact earnings. Price is just the share price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares. 

Typically, since a buyback reduces the number of outstanding shares, the share price will increase. The same company, same intrinsic value, but divided into fewer, larger, portions. 

So, if Apple buys 4% of their outstanding shares and the stock price goes up by an equivalent 4% (it could be more or less depending on investor sentiment, but let's say its an equivalent amount), then the ""price"" in the P/E ratio will be the same. 

If investors get excited about the buyback and there is increased demand for the stock, with fewer shares, there's a good chance the price of each share will go up by an amount greater than the buyback (4% in the above example). If this is the case, then the P/E ratio will go up."
2021-04-28 18:34:12,stocks,"It most likely won't ever collapse but many ""analyst"" have written obituaries for Apple in the past. The stock lost 30%+ of it's value in four months from August-December 2018. Being 30% down in your overall portfolio will test you"
2021-04-28 18:34:07,stocks,Yeah fiat is going to collapse
2021-04-28 19:13:06,stocks,correct!
2021-04-28 19:36:05,stocks,"The value of the equity also goes down by a corresponding amount. They do have to pay cash for those shares. As an equity holder you had a claim for that cash, now you do not. In finance theory a share buy back should not impact price from a mathematical standpoint. The signal that the company action sends to shareholders is what drives the price change."
2021-04-28 18:57:58,stocks,"To a smaller extent it should be noted that with less outstanding shares all future dividend payments cost the company less, theoretically slightly increasing future earnings."
2021-04-28 18:58:49,stocks,"Isn't a buyback just transferring shares from the market to the promoters? Or do the shares simply not exist any more (i.e., free value to all other shareholders)?"
2021-04-28 19:17:01,stocks,Thank you for the explanation
2021-04-28 18:50:38,stocks,Yea but if it‚Äôs long term hold you can use that past experience to show it will recover.
2021-04-28 19:38:04,stocks,">The stock lost 30%+ of it's value in four months from August-December 2018.

That had nothing to do with apple tho"
2021-04-28 19:38:51,stocks,How much do I win?
2021-04-28 19:04:47,stocks,"Yeah if anything, if Apple dips 30%, you add more shares. It‚Äôs a high yield savings account long term."
2021-04-28 19:42:15,stocks,"It's a rare retail investor who can hold after a 30% drip when 99% of their portfolio is AAPL and they started last month. I doubt the guy above knows how to eval the company beyond ""apple good"", which puts him right in line with the other 95% of this sub."
2021-04-28 19:43:52,stocks,"It did tho. Compare Apple to Microsoft during that same time. I know the market was impacted by the Fed during that phase but Apple got singled out big time. If you wanna read up on it read the article below 


https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2018/12/11/why-apple-stock-plunged-184-in-november.aspx"
2021-04-28 16:58:48,stocks,"Looking forward to your daily recaps, you're doing an amazing job!"
2021-04-28 16:45:04,stocks,"Facebook, Apple, and Google killed it this week.  Makes me very optimistic for Amazon tomorrow.  My only worry is that the price was inflated due to split rumors and if there is no split (very likely) then the stock might go down even with stellar earnings.

Guess we will know in 24 hours or so!"
2021-04-28 18:25:31,stocks,Thank ya kind sir!

2021-04-28 17:15:33,stocks,Revenue growth is massive but the one concerning thing to me is the membership guidance. As it stands right now there are 51.5 mil US members. By the end of the year they are just expecting 52-54 mil. Definitely adds some fuel to the fire that growth will be unsustainable now that the pandemic is over. Wouldn't even take that big of a miss on guidance for them to actually lose members which would seem devastating for such a high growth company. I suppose total visits could be more important and have more direct impact on future revenue. And there are other ways to grow revenue without necessarily growing to more members. Thoughts?
2021-04-28 17:51:03,stocks,"Y/y growth was astronomical. Keep in mind that most doctors offices opened for in person visits in June 2020. This growth is incredible and TDOC is first mover, provides an excellent service and after Livongo merger, home monitoring. I'm going to be buying more. 52wk high was not sustainable."

2021-04-28 17:38:06,stocks,still overvalued
2021-04-28 17:41:55,stocks,The CEO always publishes bearish guidance.

2021-04-28 17:28:14,stocks,I started selling any of my short dated calls before earnings. It seems investors no longer read the results haha.
2021-04-28 17:11:54,stocks,"Revenue was exactly what was predicted, where their loss was much greater than expected.  Not good news as we leave the pandemic"
2021-04-28 16:33:27,stocks,"Quite a few stocks sold off after earnings this week. Not sure if they missed EPS estimates, have not looked into estimates, however stock based compensation seems to be quite high this quarter."
2021-04-28 17:41:42,stocks,How come?
2021-04-28 19:14:11,stocks,Maybe not. but why go with this service when your doctor is attached to the local health system's telemedicine? I dont see their growth potential.
2021-04-28 17:40:46,stocks,What are you talking about? They just raised guidance.
2021-04-28 19:55:21,stocks,"Individual clinic or system platforms suck. It'll be like paper chart transition to EMR. It'll end up being 2-3 players, in the case of EMR Epic vs Cerner.

2021-04-28 16:17:26,stocks,üêª's on reddit: still overvalued. Crash is happening anytime now.
2021-04-28 16:28:12,stocks,"Is zuckerberg again sandbagging on guidance?

2021-04-28 17:30:26,stocks,Can't beat the Zuck.
2021-04-28 17:28:02,stocks,"This should be a trillion dollar company easily without looking at future prospects like AR/VR. They are growing top line over 30% and have current PE of 30. I dont think any other company comes close. Irrespective of FB's perception in US or few other developed markets, its still heavily used World Wide. Instagram is used by young crowd. They have so many levers to monetize that I could see them double their revenue in next 3 years. I wish I added more shares last summer when it went down to 225. Still I will hold this stock for next decade for sure."
2021-04-28 19:04:17,stocks,..That thread full of bears the other week..  yep
2021-04-28 16:21:44,stocks,"Sold half of my FB position a bit early. Was worried about new Apple's update where user can block app tracking, and thus may hurt FB in the long run."
2021-04-28 16:18:59,stocks,Man do I wish I owned some FB. I'm a new trader and haven't been around to where FB had a good entre spot. I saw ARK sold some FB yesterday and some very impressive earnings. I have the same bullish outlook on digital ad companies like FB and GOOG when everything is fully reopened.
2021-04-28 16:16:29,stocks,"As someone who took it on the chin with their PINS investment today, I am glad FB did not get sold off because their MAUs came in a bit under consensus."

2021-04-28 17:29:58,stocks,"This seems to be the norm with FB calls - earnings/revenue are up, MAUs down. The latter seems to be losing relevance as FB expands their digital marketing empire and FB trackers start appearing on more sites.

Fuck I don‚Äôt miss working in digital marketing. Just thinking about it makes me feel like I need a shower."
2021-04-28 18:22:53,stocks,"All the value in facebook ads comes from being able to target fairly precise. Now because of 14.5 you'll have no idea that someone was on a car website before jumping onto their gaming app. So you can't advertise to that person about cars. You literally cannot follow people around the web anymore if that person opts out. Every marketer knows it takes more than 1 ad to sell. This seriously cripples an advertisers effectiveness to pinpoint targets and instead they'll have to use general aggregated garbage data which is what anyone has been able to do for a hundred years.

FB used to be a main location point for people surfing the web. No one uses FB anymore. So FB ads are targeted across all apps using retargeting and facebooks algorithm of user data. You literally can't do that anymore. So now people will have to target based on what is on the website. (car stuff on car websites) instead of petfood on a car website. Anyone who doesn't think this will affect profitability is a complete moron. The only question is can facebook grow faster than this hurts it. My guess is no. As soon as economy shows a hiccup facebook is down below 200.

This same thing doesn't affect google because people actually use google directly. No one uses facebook directly like they used to. Facebook is a middleman advertiser. Middlemen always bleed in the end."
2021-04-28 16:18:53,stocks,I'm super short facebook. Finish year around 225
2021-04-28 18:27:09,stocks,FB calls saved my MSFT calls. I‚Äôm in FB at the 285c. I‚Äôll continue to roll out and up with both.

2021-04-28 18:59:18,stocks,"I bought, obvious good play to me at the time when the PE was 25. I bought some but it felt scary to do when it seemed like all tech was on a downward spiral."
2021-04-28 18:23:06,stocks,Crazy thing is at 30% y/y growth they would 2.2x their revenue. Glad I have a substantial long position I opened at 180.
2021-04-28 16:25:13,stocks,"Considering that update just launched on Tuesday, any issues it will cause won't show up in this report. It will be interesting to see what Zuck has to say on the cc, if he comments on the iOS update at all."
2021-04-28 17:29:29,stocks,You think advertisers will exit FB because of that. I doubt that will happen. Watch for another huge earnings beat in Q2 as well. As economy opens I expect travel and other companies leverage FB/IG for sure.
2021-04-28 16:29:29,stocks,Current price is a good entry spot. Lots of growth to come. Don't keep waiting and regret it now. Either you like the stock and you buy. Or you don't like it and you don't.i just bought some extra today.

2021-04-28 19:38:23,stocks,"Recognizing that there is a bubble != saying one shouldn't invest. Tech, green energy, and especially EVs are overvalued sectors right now, that's not an opinion, it's simply acknowledging an observable fact. 

However, no one knows where or how these things will go. If your investing plan relies on timing the market to pull out when you think there will be a crash, your plan is bad. If you're just a retail investor, your investment strategy shouldn't require changes based on a marked drawdown or even a market crash. I've continued to buy at ATHs, and if the whole thing tanks tomorrow then I'll continue to buy at whatever the new lows are."
2021-04-28 17:36:04,stocks,"Lmao, what's with the anger, its the fact that I was close multiple times to opening a position in FB at 267 but never ended up doing so when the whole Apple drama was going on with FB. I don't say this about every stock. Google shot up yesterday I never said ""I should have bought GOOGl last month."" Just relax lol."

2021-04-28 18:26:43,stocks,"It's not specifically at you, but it gets tiring and annoying reading comments like this every time a stock shoots up. Like I mustve seen so many when apple went from 116 to 135. It ain't productive or useful to anyone, adds absolutely zilch to a post."
2021-04-28 16:35:49,stocks,As I was typing this just saw the price shoot up LOL!

Timing the market is not a talent or skill most people possess."
2021-04-28 17:54:17,stocks,Just wait for q3...this stock will be down mid 200s after people see effects of apple capping their knees.
2021-04-28 16:39:15,stocks,"On PINS - I do too. 

I think they will be fine - have they really begun to scratch the surface on monetizing?  Plus - they barely missed at all. Still growing like crazy.

2021-04-28 17:51:03,stocks,haha you are probably right. But there are just too many headwinds against FB all while pumping in a frothy market. Pre-pandemic this company was low 200s. If anything they are in a weaker position now than they were then.

Joe Manchin and some other moderate Dems are starting to push back pretty strongly against the Biden agenda. it's all gonna get watered down significantly 

Biden is just dumb for proposing this, anyway. the best way to get more government revenue is to LOWER tax rates. to quote the economist Thomas Sowell 

>The facts are unmistakably plain, for those who bother to check the facts. In 1921, when the tax rate on people making over $100,000 a year was 73 percent, the federal government collected a little over $700 million in income taxes, of which 30 percent was paid by those making over $100,000. By 1929, after a series of tax rate reductions had cut the tax rate to 24 percent on those making over $100,000, the federal government collected more than a billion dollars in income taxes, of which 65 percent was collected from those making over $100,000.

2021-04-28 19:55:02,stocks,"Are you risk averse? Do you have a history of low-self-control during gambling? Are you looking for a set-and-forget strategy that requires little mind share and little management?

Are you looking to turn 40k into 100k in a short period of time? How desperately would you need the 40k in 3 months? in 12 months? in 3 years?

Everyone here is recommending VOO and VTI because its the best ""set and forget"" strategy. If you want low stress, benchmarked returns, reliable growth, pick this. Any other strategy has good reason to think that it won't beat a VOO/VTI strategy.

But if you're feeling more appetite for risk, I would take that 40k and invest it in 4 different stocks in completely different sectors. I would pick one of the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and drop 10k in there. Those stocks are ripping right now, and their market dominance is really showing. I would pick a high growth stock in a sector you enjoy. I personally like cloud software and cyber security stocks (ie. CRWD, NET, TWLO, etc). I think green energy is beaten down real good and will see good returns over the next 4 years. Take a look at companies in that space (ie. TSLA, CHPT, ENPH, ICLN?, etc). And fintech is pretty hot as well with higher risk plays in this space (ie. SQ, IPOE, FUTU, COIN, etc).

There are so many sectors and so many stocks that it can be easily overwhelming.


But my personal advice? Take $30k and dump it into VOO or VTI. Take the remaining 10k and pick 4 stocks you REALLY REALLY like. Something you use every day, something your personally passionate about, something that you will defend to your dying breathe at dinner parties and barbecues. Then buy $2500 of each of those 4  stocks.

Then benchmark your individual stock picking performance against VOO/VTI. Are you better than broad market or worst?"
2021-04-28 15:06:45,stocks,"Invest for the long term by putting most of the 40k into broad market ETFs like VOO, SPY, etc and then put a smaller portion into strong individual companies you personally believe in, for example I would go with Amazon, Apple or Microsoft."

2021-04-28 16:45:48,stocks,"Stocks are currently over valued. We are in speculation mode. 

Honestly your best bet would be to just put it all in AMD at 85 and hold it for a year and then sell. 

Once the fed starts to taper the market will see a huge correction. You'll be gambling that the fed won't do that in the next 12 months. 

This is terrible advice but it's honestly probably the best advice. You could see a 20% gain with AMD in the next 12 months. 

Chase released a report that showed an expected 4% return over the next decade. In other words, we are at or near the top of this cycle and the next decade will have very poor returns. 

AMD isn't speculation. It's valued at 115 and is trading at 85. But there are stocks trading at 4-10x intrinsic value. 

Another idea is to take that 40k, pay down your mortgage and refinance (if you haven't already). You'll get a guaranteed return of 3%. That's infinity larger than a loss. Then you can take your increased cash flow from a smaller mortgage and buy VOO on a regular interval. Dollar cost averaging is the way to go. You could dollar cost average the 40k over 12 months but you'd have 40k mostly doing nothing during that time period. 

This is the worst time to put a lump sum into stocks. 

Good luck."

For the past 5 years big oil companies have slashed their exploration budgets, and analysts have been screaming for a couple years now that while we have been in a glut, we are heading for a drought in the next few years because fields that are producing today aren't going to produce forever at profitable levels and need to be replaced with fresh discoveries."

I mean, if it's just some meme of a monkey riding a rocket talking about a squeeze, it's probably garbage.  If someone presents some evidence that something might be going on with a stock, then maybe there is something to it to keep digging in to.

&#x200B;

Guess I totally dodged the qeustion.  Yes, no doubt there will be a lot more mention of squeezes, mostly just people trying to capture the same momentum.  But, I feel like there is most likely a lot more fuckery going on in the shorts world, so not a bad idea to keep an eye on the mentions that come up."
2021-04-28 15:29:11,stocks,Its already used too much
2021-04-28 18:03:56,stocks,"So let me address this.

Shorting is part of the game, like many have said, usually for good reason. After all why short a stock that is healthy. That would be pure stupidity.

The ultimate shorting is of course when it bankrupts, so that can be for sure a goal to do that.
But let's assume for a moment this is not the goal.

So squeeze potential, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Company gets shorted, people buy when it's low, eventually shorts gets covered, price goes up for a short bit, and think they did well.
And yes individually they definitely could, but the people shorting probably made a killing already, and average retails hold the bag.

So what if things are different.

I want to look at AMC here, since I know much more about it then GME.

AMC was doing horrible last year, between debt and covid, they were in a massive mess.
They raised capital, theaters are opening and this obviously make the stock worth more. Now how much? Who could say. But it's fair to say that it's worth more than half a year ago from a purely objective standpoint.

Then there is the squeeze. The stock got heavily shorted, reported numbers put it over 20%, fee is over 20%, utilisation at 99/100%, 3+ days to cover etc.
The numbers are all there. The stock has went way up, so even if they could cover all of it at the current price, they (hedgies like citadel) would be losing so much money, in fact they already lost massive amounts. Simply put, they are in big trouble.

Now what does the community claim, 1k, 10k and even 100k per share. I always say I do not know where it goes, but 100k is flatout BS. Though in fairness, if you can make people believe it, it's easier to get the price up when they start to cover.

So why is this different? Outside of the numbers, the most important part is that AMC is worth more than where they shorted, they cannot bring the price back to that point, and retails won't let them, it doesn't matter what the market usually does, if people do not sell, they have a massive problem.

The AMC short squeeze is real, it's that simple.

Now will everyone make money? Of course not. At 20-25% only a part will make solid money. How much? No idea, but this is 100% worth it.

Don't believe me, put a remindme in here for say 3 months."

2021-04-28 13:30:30,stocks,"100% yes it will be/is now overused. GME in January was a very unique case in that it was a) an extremely heavily shorted stock, and b) there was a genuine contrarian recovery play going on there. Personally I don‚Äôt think it justified its current valuation - but remember back in January GME was only valued at $1bn, so even a modest improvement in its future prospects could have massively improved its valuation.

If both those factors hadn‚Äôt been present ie extreme shorting and a Cohen-led recovery play, we wouldn‚Äôt have seen a squeeze like we did. Equally Volkswagen in 2008 was very unique - first of all the German government owned a big chunk of the stock meaning it wasn‚Äôt available to trade, and secondly Porsche had built up a huge hidden long position which the market wasn‚Äôt aware of (they were aiming to takeover Volkswagen using huge amounts of leverage, although ironically VW ended up buying them).

I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt be contrarian or think the market/hedge funds aren‚Äôt ever wrong - they often are, and there is plenty of money to be made by contrarian plays/buying into undervalued companies.
But usually if a company is heavily shorted there is a reason for it (ie it‚Äôs a cr*ppy company - these hedge funds are generally pretty smart guys) - and secondly even with significant short interest there is rarely ever the catalyst for a short squeeze.

So yes in summary I think it will be heavily overused going forward without much merit (both on a certain sub Reddit and also CNBC)"
2021-04-28 17:43:55,stocks,"Partially. I also think that there is a legit realization by retail that institutional traders engage in short-based shenanigans and that retail has power to make them bleed.  
There are many companies out there that are heavily shorted and some of those are prime for a squeeze. That is not to say that even those will squeeze.  Another potential outcome of the GME situation is that, as Melvin outright said, short-interest players will keep mum about what they do, though if your broker tells you a share is hard-to-borrow or the fees are exorbitant then that's a pretty big tell something's afoot.  In the end, retail's realization of what can be done will probably act as a check on the use of shorting.  

In regards to GME, I am unsure what to think. The price is quite high, which could reflect demand created by retail itself, that there's a legit belief that this company can transition to a successful and profitable one, or that a squeeze is in the works. What I dislike is that any criticism is rejected outright, although what I see is that most of the criticism is trolling the crowd and they may be wanting to keep positive (really, if one has no skin in the game, who GAF about what other people do with their money)."

Market Manipulation = WSB definition of any investment activity, whether bullish or bearish that might adversely affect your investment in GME or AMC.

SEC = WSB definition is An ineffective agency who will not intervene to make all of your investments in GME and AMC winning investments.

Brilliant Investment Strategy - Any investment in GME of any size or whatever you have heard that DFV, Elon Musk or Ryan Cohen are doing. 

Ladder Attacks - When GME stock price declines.

Short Squeeze - When GME stock price increases.

Gamma Squeeze - may be substituted for short squeeze when trying to sound more informed.

Synthetic Shares - Shares of GME stock created by evil hedge funds to allow short sellers to cover short positions and prevent GME stock from rising to $10,000 per share.

2021-04-28 13:26:23,stocks,I hope its thought of a lot. IMO shorting of stocks should scare HF's. I think its a low way to make money.
2021-04-28 15:49:09,stocks,"I think we'll need you and all the circle-jerkers here to continue gatekeeping these terms and let everyone know when they can or cannot use them.  Be sure to interrupt  any conversation, anywhere with proper definition.  While you are at it, can you defend the exact definition of ""irony"". You seem like that kinda guy."

I don't think you understand how rampant the shorting has been lol"
2021-04-28 14:30:05,stocks,Yes. It‚Äôs already happening.
2021-04-28 14:36:21,stocks,Yes forsure
2021-04-28 16:01:30,stocks,"What about ladder attack? 

Seems like diamond hands, stonks, squeeze, to the moon are and will continue to be overused for the next couple of months."
2021-04-28 16:05:44,stocks,"We started seeing this immediately after the WSB short-squeeze hype surrounding GME in mid January. Because of the level of activity GME caused and because it was a traditional short squeeze, we see people who are actively trying to manipulate the market to their benefit by calling everything with over a 5% short float a potential short squeeze candidate. It's all just a new take on manipulating markets but now we're seeing it with huge companies, something very unusual.

I first started trading penny stocks when I was a teenager on some random app that's now almost certainly defunct. What I'm seeing now is exactly what I was seeing then. You go on to a message board (in this case reddit) and there's one person who claims to know a stock will move quickly up. They pump the stock on all the boards and get enough sheeple to dump a few bucks in which of course artificially inflates that price and then a few people make money hand over fist while everyone else is left bag-holding.

The only difference here is that these are large cap stocks, not some random penny stock with no volume. We're seeing it with huge corporations like Rocket Mortgage and even more so with all the drug/pharma companies back in early February. You take any highly speculative stock and look at their January or February graphs and you'll see the power of this 'short-squeeze' tactic. There are so many more people able to invest today that are simply following WSB or call-outs on Twitter and investing. 

The good news is, because these are large cap stocks generally, there's no real fear of losing everything... like I did when I was just a teenager with a few bucks to trade. If these folks just let their investments sit for a few months they'll almost certainly gain back all their losses."
2021-04-28 17:17:15,stocks,"Have you been living under a rock. This has been the norm on Reddit, stocktwits, etc since February"
2021-04-28 15:15:19,stocks,It‚Äôs just a bunch of GME generation traders not knowing shit. It happens in every field.
2021-04-28 14:30:03,stocks,"People need some reason to invest their money in a ticker and a Short squeeze is the easiest reason to buy something now.   Everyone and their dog wants to ride the next GME.  A lot of them will get burnt, but that is how the market works."
2021-04-28 15:49:10,stocks,"""Squeeze"" will be the new P&D catalyst."
2021-04-28 16:00:59,stocks,‚ÄúOMG the gamma squeeze is coming guys hold the line!!‚Äù - person with 3 shares invested in a meme stock
2021-04-28 16:03:17,stocks,It is already over used. Swear I see a post every day.
2021-04-28 16:52:57,stocks,"GME ruined so much. Everything is either a short squeeze, ladder attack, or a conspiracy."
2021-04-28 16:54:52,stocks,"All this paranoia about excessive short positions and ladder attacks and whatnot is representative of the expectation that market manipulation and corruption are active throughout, and that is exactly why I think that when the next big correction or crash comes, it will bring about a prolonged bear market similar to post dot-com bubble. It will be the proof positive for most people that the stock market is just a big scam."
2021-04-28 16:55:56,stocks,"Yes, and short ladder attacks"
2021-04-28 17:00:11,stocks,Bruh
2021-04-28 17:26:43,stocks,Already happening
2021-04-28 18:08:59,stocks,"Yeah, I'm seeing it used on basically anything with SI > 0%.

Between balls being broken and rules being changed, there's probably never going to be anything like GME again and thank goodness for that.  Not to say short squeezes will be impossible, but they will hopefully never be *basically* guaranteed like that.

Besides, as someone else noted below the OG ""short squeeze"" is now much more about rampant securities fraud under cover of an atrociously designed regulatory framework."
2021-04-28 18:53:38,stocks,"Uh.... ""will be""? It's totally rampant and widespread already. It's become just a meaningless phrase that asinine people blindly repeat.

FFS, now any time ANY stock drops, a bunch of idiots on reddit, webull chat, and even on Stocktwits will immediately start yelling about ""the shorts"" and blaming them for any ticker that doesn't gain 5% a day or more. Last week they were bitching about ""shorts"" on DOGE. As if."

2021-04-28 13:59:12,stocks,Yup
2021-04-28 14:05:51,stocks,sure
2021-04-28 18:47:53,stocks,Well this is the thing u got to do actually research and see IMO gme squeezed can only get so much I personally don‚Äôt believe we see 500 again. But I believe amc and XL fleet got a real chance to squeeze. Cramer yesterday was mad because CNBC and goldmens Sachs got a short position on XL fleet. So he bashed it and had his temper mad because they borrowed so much shares and people weren‚Äôt selling and kept buying. IMO do the research if shorts looking desperate and spam the message boards to get people to sell than tells u a lot.
2021-04-28 15:42:22,stocks,Its already overused.

2021-04-28 17:25:11,stocks,I think I helped alot of people not to freak out and paper hand a stock because it dips.  Squeeze or not.
2021-04-28 17:29:16,stocks,Will be? Where have you been? That's been happening already.

2021-04-28 16:04:44,stocks,"EVERYTHING has been labeled a short squeeze the last few months. The rocket emojis always let me know how relevant the squeeze du jour is. I got tired of mocking people, so I just started blocking. GME, through no fault of their own, ruined a lot of subreddits and created several trash ones."
2021-04-28 16:05:02,stocks,With all the changes in regulations they'll be rare and not near as extreme as what we have seen and are about to see.
2021-04-28 16:06:09,stocks,It already is. Everytime stock moves up a little it‚Äôs a ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù and when it goes down it‚Äôs being ‚Äúmanipulated by shorts‚Äù. Don‚Äôt want to sound arrogant but it‚Äôs amusing how dumb people are.
2021-04-28 16:09:24,stocks,And also it seems mentioning ‚Äúshort interest‚Äù in a title of a reddit post/ youtube video etc. is a bigger clickbait than ‚Äúhuge potential stock‚Äù or ‚Äúbuy these now‚Äù

2021-04-28 17:02:12,stocks,Where have you been OP?  This has already happened.
2021-04-28 17:02:42,stocks,"kind of like the word ""unprecedented"".  Maybe they'll start calling them unprecidented short squeezes.  Because you know, they have to differentiate it from all the rest ..."
2021-04-28 17:04:38,stocks,"Unfortunately yes. People can't understand that this is a really rare event, especially in Gamestop's case which is popularizing the term and will probably be the only time we see such a squeeze"
2021-04-28 17:07:45,stocks,The term short squeeze can be pretty loose. If im short a stock and it rises too much me covering will drive up the price so any heavily shorted stock is susceptible to a form of a short squeeze. With momentum trading gaining popularity it can be very easy to be caught in a mild short squeeze.
2021-04-28 17:10:42,stocks,Its already happening hahaha

2021-04-28 18:25:33,stocks,It has been boosted into the lexicon of a substantial number of folks since the year began. So I think it'll stick around for awhile. Can't guess towards the staying power of the term.

2021-04-28 14:14:52,stocks,"It‚Äôs highly ethical to bet a stock will go up but it‚Äôs evil to bet a stock will go down?

please explain.

Short sellers help to drive down prices of over valued stocks. It also provides liquidity. Who will sell stock if nobody is selling? Who will buy stock when nobody will? We should begrudge them a reward for their risk?

Market makers are the people who actually make your trades. They find sellers and buyers to marry. Sometimes it‚Äôs not possible for the market maker to make fast trades so they buy, sell or borrow shares so your play happens fast.

These market makers are making plays with the goal of making fast trades, not to make money. They buy sell and borrow when it‚Äôs not to their advantage.

To offset this activity they get a spread in the bid/ask and they leverage like crazy. This rare breed needs deep pockets and usually are backed by rich people who want yields. They often live in hedge funds and other institutions that are comfy with hedge risks and demand high returns.

I don‚Äôt see the evil in this. Do you?"

2021-04-28 15:19:42,stocks,"lmao the part that cracks me up is that /r/wsb and /r/gme is screeching ""Market Manipulation! Fraud! Securities felony!""

Like, you guys realize that convincing a shareholder base to not sell shares, regardless of if the offering price is higher than the intrinsic value of the stock itself, in a coordinated effort to drive the price higher and higher to enrich oneself, is exactly what market manipulation is and what you're trying to do here, right? 

Just because yall've convinced yourself it's a culture war against gamers (dinosaur rawr!!) vs hedgies (stupid chads!) doesn't mean it's legal or just. Those guys just all hang out in an echo chamber reassuring one another that what they're doing is right and that they'll end up winning in the end and not financially assfucking a bunch of bored dudes in their 20s and 30s that will almost certainly be left holding the bag.

The entire framework of securities law in the US revolves around making sure markets behave efficiently (hence why insider trading is a crime)."

The reality is that hedge funds will feast on each other if they out themselves into vulnerable positions. Retail coordinated their buying on gamestop, yes, but they had significant tailwinds with other whale entities taking the same position.

2021-04-28 15:12:54,stocks,"I think its more evil to continue to push a company into an overvalued range. Its selfish to take away buying opportunities from everyone else, right? 

The reason people put money into the stock market is because they expect gains. Gains only happen with swings in price (volatility). Being able to make money on the way up and the way down is a blessing.   Since the share price is tied to company valuation, if prices never came down, prices would also never go up in a way that was interesting enough to attractive new money to the stock market. 

If I taught a class on trading stocks, I would be a bad teacher if I didn't teach how to sell. I personally do not sell shares (close out positions) unless I would short the stock. Therefore, I need to know how and when to short stocks as well. Otherwise I would either be a nervous wreck or a bag holder."

This happens in every field tbh, where certain people try to push the boundries. But that doesnt mean anything for a particular superstonk at all.

2021-04-28 16:39:58,stocks,"I‚Äôm heavily into GME and yes it does get pretty ‚Äúcultish‚Äù in these subs. I think there‚Äôs two reasons it‚Äôs garnered a cult like following, for myself included. 
1. Blatant fuckery. I personally bought in after seeing RH shut down their buy button. You can argue why they did this all day, but no matter if it was malicious or not, retail investors got screwed here. Also, the borrow rate for shorts is staying around 1% which does not make sense considering there are not many shorts available and the SI is still really high (around 20% last time I checked). 
2. It is becoming a mix between growth and value investing. GME is positioned to become one of the biggest companies in the video game market. This market is RAPIDLY growing and changing, making it all the more possible for GME to suck up a decent percent of the market share. Not just for selling copies of games, but selling peripherals as well, pc parts, and they‚Äôre even stepping into esports (I think) which will be huge in the next decade. This is why it‚Äôs a growth stock, yet is slowly becoming a value play because of recent events. They paid off almost all of their long term debt, raised 551MM by selling shares (which even made the price go up after this announcement. lmao), and currently have a market cap of 12.5BB. Comparatively, this is small relative to how large the market for gaming is. They still are pivoting their business model so their finances aren‚Äôt going to reflect this for at least a year if they pull off their strategy. I have faith they will be able to considering the new directors hired on, and their decision to compensate upper level management with shares rather than salaries. 

The company is making some good strategic moves for the future, and the markets showing indications of fuckery afoot, which arguably can be blamed on the cultish following looking for anything that they can say is correlated. But, where there is smoke, there is fire. Only time will tell what shady stuff is going on behind the scenes here.

2021-04-28 15:13:12,stocks,"Yeah agreed. I know on certain sub reddits it‚Äôs become fashionable to see short sellers as ‚Äúevil greedy hedge funds‚Äù but they‚Äôre just playing the other side of the coin to a long investor, there‚Äôs nothing particularly nefarious about them.

As you said short sellers do fulfil a pretty useful market role in coming up with a thesis for why a company is overvalued/a fraud, and then they try to make money off that thesis.

Tbh short-only funds have it much harder than traditional long hedge funds (many funds are a mix of the two) - because a) markets generally go up naturally over time, and b) you are fighting ‚Äúagainst the system‚Äù ie your thesis will be taken apart and attacked by the company‚Äôs management, bullish sellside analysts, as well as investors in the company. Whereas if you put out a really positive report on a company, you wouldn‚Äôt get any negative comment from management or investors.

Not trying to romanticize short sellers - just saying they‚Äôre in it to make money like regular investors, and ultimately they also live and die by the accuracy of their investment ideas. Nothing special or ‚Äúevil‚Äù about them, and in fact they perform a useful function in the market"

In the case of tech growth stocks it‚Äôs not the case they‚Äôre dying companies I‚Äôll admit, but especially back in Feb there were a lot of tech companies where people could make the thesis that the company was overvalued. 

Not saying I agree with them necessarily - personally I have around 25% of my portfolio in tech, but there were/are definitely some tech companies that potentially outgrew their valuations. I wouldn‚Äôt class it as FUD to be fair - after all you can have an amazing tech company, but if it has an extremely high valuation you can still make the argument as a short seller that it‚Äôs over-valued."

2021-04-28 19:56:18,stocks,"With respect I think you‚Äôre maybe taking a single quote from Plotkin out of context (I don‚Äôt remember him saying he knew definitely the price rise wasn‚Äôt due to a short squeeze, maybe he did?) in order to fit the narrative.

GME has been discussed to death so I‚Äôm hesitant to respond, but I‚Äôll just summarise briefly. Melvin was literally almost forced into insolvency and was pretty much forced to exit all its short positions at a huge loss - I mean that is the definition of a short squeeze, no? After all Plotkin wasn‚Äôt suddenly buying into GME because he believed in the company, he was doing it to get out of an unsustainable short position (ie a short squeeze).
Also regardless of what exactly Plotkin said at the hearings, he can only testify to what he is aware of - he wouldn‚Äôt have insight to what other hedge funds etc were doing exactly (orders go through a marketmaker so you can‚Äôt see who exactly is buying what as it happens). So it‚Äôs at least likely other funds were squeezed too, even if Plotkin didn‚Äôt mention them.

I mean your theory is the price went to $400 from $40 and that wasn‚Äôt due to short selling, therefore short selling hasn‚Äôt happened? That seems like circular logic.

As many retail investors as there are out there, I‚Äôm pretty confident they couldn‚Äôt single handedly pump a $1bn company to $10bn without some external factor like a short squeeze. And if it was an institutional investor - what, they bought the price up to $400 for no apparent reason (no earnings etc), then cashed out back down to $40 giving themselves a huge loss? I mean that makes zero sense.

So what is much more likely is it was a short squeeze driving it to $400 due to the very unique circumstances in January. The squeeze ended and the stock drifted back to $50. 

Granted, it has pumped back up to $150-160, but it hasn‚Äôt really done anything since then despite all the positive news around Cohen fundraising etc. So why would it jump to $400 naturally in January on no news at all, yet remain basically flat for long periods of time at $150-160 when positive news is coming out?

Simplest explanation is usually the correct one"

A gamma surge like that doesn‚Äôt require high short interest either. And yet, the cultists insist the hedge funds are their enemy.

It wasn‚Äôt retail traders blowing GME up in after hours trading the other night either.

If these people took gains every time it blew up from gamma they could‚Äôve made huge profits instead of holding through spikes and dips. Regardless, this sub and other investing subs needs to come down harder on the brigading conspiracy theory shit."

WSB had some downright solid DDs before, sure they were always autistic r*****s who enjoyed going for high-risk ballsy plays, but for the most part they were legitimate in so far that they *could* print money if something very specific and unlikely they predicted could happen did happen. But again, now that subreddit has ascended into discussing situations that would defy all forms of common sense, basic financial knowledge and laws of physics.

There is a fine line between ‚Äòimprobable‚Äô and ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô that is day by day getting more eroded in the minds of that subreddit‚Äôs readers. For the most part I think a lot of them are good old school r*****s who want to make some lunch money by betting on or against the S&P with some crazy leverage because they actually read up on economic reports, but more and more it‚Äôs attracting downright crackbrained imbeciles preaching about the end of the financial institutions as we know them if only GME will moon üíéüôå

2021-04-28 16:26:48,stocks,"Not sure how you get to that conclusion. There were 3 different hedge funds that initially uncovered the impending financial catastrophe that was looming. Because of the incentive of short selling they did research and found out what was about to happen and opened their short positions. If there was no incentive to make money they wouldn‚Äôt have even bothered. The cause was a combination of factors but the biggest one was banks giving loans to people who couldn‚Äôt afford them. The expectation of consistent payment lead the banks to get greedy and lazy and they sold them off as investment vehicles to other institutions.

Short selling is a form of accountability. The biggest corporate frauds have been discovered by short selling hedge funds from 2008 to Enron."

Sure you can fine that number, but it is not like it is the simplest metric to track. On the 08 bubble was discovered by a hedge fund and they actually invented shorting mortgage securities.

You can use those losses from 2020 on your 2020 return to offset your gains. If you did not have enough gains to use up all those losses, then you can use up to 3k of it against your income. Anything over that 3k will rollover to 2021 taxes. If you sold stock for a profit in 2021 (this is based off the individual investment) you will have to pay taxes when you file them."

2021-04-28 13:49:48,stocks,"Again, assuming you are in the US and have to pay their taxes. That is false, you will owe taxes when you file them on the profit you made. You will have a realized capital gains and that is what you owe taxes on. In your example, if you sold a stock and made $20k in realized gains you will owe taxes on that even if you reinvest that money somewhere else. What taxes you owe (short vs long term) is depending on how long you held the stock for."

No doubt apple is a great company, but it (and alot of companies) look overvalued. What do you guys think, are high valuations here to stay for a while until a market crash / correction? How far can this go?"

2021-04-28 11:12:46,stocks,"there won't be as big a crash as all of the spooky clickbaity articles suggest. there may be one or two volatility blips, but the dynamics of too much capital chasing too few opportunities is here for the next few years. 

We'll see higher lows for as long as the current sentiment prevails, and in the future, these current prices can be seen as sort of an even market valuation looking into years 2024 and beyond. There are a ton of reasons for this current sentiment. 

The largest of which, in my opinion, is the fact that the working class has few options to put their $1000 in savings for the month other than the market. Sure if they had a couple hundred thousand sitting around they could purchase real estate and put together a portfolio of rental properties. But with $1000, fractional shares, unrivaled liquidity, and the growing nature of everything, it'll be the market that investors, freshly hired on these new jobs that are produced as we exit the recession, invest in. Workers will either do this directly through retail stock buying, or indirectly via their 401(k). either way, a significant portion of their earnings will reach the market somehow.

This can go as long as unemployment is declining, and some years after that. 

One thing we haven't seen is a flight to safety. Companies like $T, $O, $BA, $MSFT, $LMT, $AVGO, etc., ones that have good solid operations, haven't seen their common stock bid up as high as these meme stocks like $TSLA, etc. have seen. Even though they've all been bid up pretty effing high. so basically, you're safe given the pent up demand for these stocks and how it's perpetuated by the policies put forth by our fearless central bank."

I just read about a ""value investor"" who ended his life yesterday. He ran two multi billion dollar funds into the ground because he thought stocks were overpriced for the past 13 years and didn't buy anything. 

P/E ratio has been expanding since the 1970s in part because US Dollar is completely fiat and money supply is being inflated.  Maybe it'd too high now, or maybe we doubled the money supply in the past year and are stuck in a low yield trap..

Maybe P/E will return to ""normal"" levels because price drops, or maybe earnings will skyrocket.

If you're worried then look at earnings results and guidance. Stocks that beat earnings estimates and give good guidance are almost always higher 9 months later.  Did AAPL have a good report?  TSLA?  MSFT?"

Three reasons their high P/E may be justified: (1) growth.  what matters is future earnings into the distant future not today's earnings, (2) the discount rate or cost of capital is so low that PV of future earnings is higher, and (3) these two companies have a lot of excess cash on the balance sheet that does not contribute much to earnings in this low interest rate environment.  To value the business you would need to add in this excess cash."

2021-04-28 13:40:17,stocks,"I guess the factor you haven‚Äôt included is what is the potential for future growth of these companies? I mean for example Amazon had a PE of over 1000 a few years ago - and obviously back then it would‚Äôve been a fantastic buy.

What I mean is why high PE ratios can suggest the stock is higher risk, big tech generally attracts higher PE multiples due to the fact there is still huge potential even for mature tech companies (for example Google have entire divisions dedicated to technology 5-10yrs away, self driving cars, aiming to develop self aware AI etc)

Whereas a bank like Goldman has a much lower PE ratio because whilst it is a huge reliable cash cow, ultimately a mature bank just can‚Äôt grow like a big tech company can.

2021-04-28 17:31:48,stocks,"The recovery stocks? I own quite a few bank stocks (Goldman, JPM) but my favourite recovery plays currently are:

- RYCEY - Rolls Royce, nothing to do with the cars btw (they sold that to BMW years ago) - they‚Äôre an industrial powerhouse, think a leaner/nimbler version of GE. They have big defence contracts, burgeoning green tech, nuclear power station contracts - their bread and butter is jet engines which has obviously been hit hard, but they‚Äôve raised $10bn in funding now so have ample liquidity even if airline travel doesn‚Äôt recover.

And if there is a big recovery - currently it has a $12bn market cap, pretty much half of it what it was pre covid. If jet engine orders go back to pre Covid levels, they‚Äôll be making $2bn profit a year. Plus you get exposure to their other research eg green tech

BP - similarly massively down from pre Covid levels. Nowadays it‚Äôs trendy to sh*t all over big oil, but ultimately whatever happens with green tech, oil will be huge for the next 20-30 yrs minimum (not just cars it‚Äôs used in plastics and tons of other materials everyone uses daily). When things go back to normal it should recover 50%+ hopefully

Boeing - similar story to Rolls Royce, still massively below pre pandemic levels. Unless you think air travel will stay low permanently, should be huge scope for recovery

REITs are also worth looking into imho, I own a few - they‚Äôve been beaten up badly during Covid and obviously retail/office has been hit badly, but again I would expect the worst to be behind them - yet many of them are still substantially below pre Covid levels

So yeah that‚Äôs my ‚Äúold economy‚Äù basket of stocks - despite not being as exciting as tech, I‚Äôm actually doing very well so far (up around 30% since start of the year) - of course it very much depends on the speed of the recovery"

If yes, don't add - and even consider selling depending on how significantly things have changed.  If no, hold and look to add.  Which brings us to the next question: When should I add?

The way I approach it is I typically like to wait for the dust to settle, depending on how big the drop has been.  I want to wait for the selling pressure to subside before buying more.  That way you avoid trying to catch the falling knife.

The other thing I do is look at the chart for some obvious price levels that may support the stock.  Those are the areas where other investors typically look to buy.  Things like major moving averages and demand zones.  This will help me develop a plan.  For example, ""Look to add when the stock hits and bounces off the 50 day moving average but be prepared to add if it shows signs of recovery before that."""

When I first buy into a play I always buy 2 shares and when I average down I just buy 1 more then the last time I bought in. For example if I bought 2 shares the next time I see a price that I like I'd buy 3 shares and have 5 shares in total. I decide to buy more shares based on the RSI, I'm not sure how short/long you're trying to hold these positions but I hold for a month so when I see it go oversold I scoop up more shares.

Research potential positions for any pending news that could have a big influence on price (ex: pending FDA review of a new drug for a biotech company, you want to avoid these).

Biggest advantage I see to swing trading is that you can still have a regular job, so you aren't dependent on withdrawing from your trading account to pay living expenses. This lets you use your account to grow your account."

With Intel and TSMC(this one been the main supplier for apple chips) announcement of 30-40B on fab space in Arizona for 5nm fabs and government pushing for trillions in development, I think we will hit a point where supply is greater than demand in like 4-5 years which will make US supply chain more independent in this field but will also hit the market in terms of having too much capacity that we don‚Äôt really need. This will be pivotal, the supply will sure become more useful in the future but short term it might affect us in a negative way. I think this will hit all big tech companies, Apple included, but Apple also has the advantage of moving to ARM earlier than any other company of its size and having already amazing integration. I think this will make them recover faster companies others, they simply will have already adapted to where the market wants to go, since IMO ARM is the future of computer architecture. 
TLDR: 2 years for supply to level, 4-5 for us to see too much supply and not enough demand, and then recovery. I already own Apple shares, I wouldn‚Äôt buy today unless I‚Äôm think in short term, but I would buy in the future after this transition periods.

2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"Newsletter: Bob Brinker's Marketimer vs. Investory Advisory Service vs. Nate's Notes? Which one? I'm old school and like stock newsletters. I'm trying to decide between these 3--which offer print and have good reports through Hulbert.

Any recs?

Bob Brinker's Marketimer (Since 1988 gain is 5.64% risk rating .88)

Investor Advisory Service (Since 1995 gain is 13.73% risk rating 5.54)

Nate's Notes (Since 1999 gain is 13.95% risk rating 8.35)"
2021-04-28 12:02:58,stocks,"I'm the editor of the Investor Advisory Service (IAS), so I can perhaps provide some info.

All three of these newsletters have long track records that have been validated by [HulbertRatings.com](https://HulbertRatings.com). In particular, Marketimer and IAS have both been on the Hulbert Investment Newsletter Honor Roll for the past 11 years. This means that they have both outperformed all bull and bear market cycles since 3/31/2000, providing a more consistent result for subscribers along the way (going up more than the market during bull cycles and falling less than the market in bear cycles). The Honor Roll approach for measuring performance puts less emphasis on the newsletters that turn in super results during bull cycles but then fall off severely during bear cycles (or vice versa), so there will be other newsletters that top the performance rankings for different periods.

For instance, Nate's Notes' ""Wagamore Advisory Letter"" is currently the best performing newsletter for the TTM as of 3/31/2021, but the worst performing newsletter for the last 5 years. There's nothing wrong with this, but subscribers should understand the range of returns for different periods and market cycles that a newsletter typically achieves so they can avoid dumping the newsletter picks during periods of underperformance. This is often difficult to do -- if the market is up 30% and your newsletter picks are down 30%, it can be hard to sit tight even if that's the best thing you could do. Hulbert's Honor Roll methodology is meant to filter newsletters so that the ones that qualify will generate ""smoother"" returns over time.

Marketimer is more short-term in focus and attempts to time purchases and sales (as suggested by the name), while Nate's Notes and IAS are more long-term focused. Nate's Notes makes changes to its model portfolio almost monthly, while it's possible to be a buy-and-hold investor following IAS picks and only make a few portfolio adjustments a year. This is important to consider based on how you want to monitor your own portfolio and how often you are willing to make changes.

All of Hulbert's calculated returns are based on pre-tax figures, so that's something to consider when selecting a newsletter -- are you investing in a tax-advantaged account like an IRA or in a taxable account? A short-term focused newsletter may have more gains taxable at short-term rates, which would cause some decay in your personal returns.

IAS only covers stocks, Marketimer uses mutual funds, and Nate's Notes recommend ETFs and stocks.

Nate's Notes and Marketimer offer model portfolios that are for intended for subscribers to follow, while IAS leaves portfolio construction to subscribers according to their own objectives, preferences, and tolerances. IAS covers about 90 stocks in total with updated buy/sell prices each month and 3 more complete recommendations in each monthly issue. Nate's covers about 20 securities in total with some hedging investments & ETFs along with stocks. Marketimer typically includes even fewer securities in his Model Portfolio I, with just a handful of funds.

Since IAS doesn't offer a model portfolio like most other newsletters, Hulbert constructs a hypothetical portfolio of all picks we designate as being in a ""buy"" price range and rebalances it each month accordingly. In practice, few subscribers would follow this same procedure, so individual subscriber returns will vary. This is likely the case even with newsletters that offer model portfolio since many subscribers probably don't automatically execute every portfolio change recommended by the newsletter.

Any other questions, let me know."
2021-04-28 13:07:18,stocks,"Hi! Thank you u/gerlach so much for a well written comment instead of simply advertising IAS -- I really appreciate that.

I do really appreciate that IAS has remained stable in both bull and bear markets, and that it doesn't just go with the trends.

I was thinking of using one of the newsletters for my individual taxable account, as I have my roth ira in a three fund bogglehead style that I'm pretty content with.

I do like that the other newsletters have a model portfolio, as I worry with IAS I would need to make judgement calls on which stocks to go in on--though I guess I could be like Hulbert and just divide on all the recommended.

Any other info you'd like to share? Really would appreciate it! I love the newsletters and would love to find one that works for me."
2021-04-28 13:08:53,stocks,"Would you be able to explain more difference between IAS and Nates Notes? As well as any other competitors you believe are quality newsletters.

For example, how would have 10k invested done by following the recommendations of each newsletter in the past 10 or 5 years?

Thanks!

&#x200B;

P.S - Other newsletters I'm looking at are ""the buyback letter"" or the ""cabot turnaround letter"" and ""investech""...any thoughts on that?"
2021-04-28 16:34:35,stocks,"I use a similar approach in my retirement vs. taxable accounts as you do. In my tax-advantaged retirement accounts, I use 3 index funds (based on a strategy in a book that I co-wrote 20 years ago called The Armchair Millionaire), divided into US large-cap, US small-cap, and international large-cap stocks. Then in my taxable accounts I invest in individual stocks (disclosure: the bulk of my individual equity holdings are stocks that we cover in our two newsletters, though I am prohibited from buying or selling in advance of publication).

We believe an investor really just needs a portfolio of 15-20 stocks in order to achieve maximum diversification, as long as the portfolio includes a number of industries, sectors, small, midsized, and large companies. This concentration forces focus and reduces the tendency of portfolio returns to regress to the mean -- IOW, the more stocks you own past 30, the more your risk will not decrease and the greater the chance that your returns will tend to be very close to the overall market returns. How the IAS newsletter works in this context is that we present 3 stocks each month as our official ""buy"" recommendations. A subscriber would look at those three and might reject one since they already have too much technology in their portfolio, might reject another because it's too large and they have already have too many large-caps, and then decide to use some of their cash to buy the third, a smaller biotech. Another subscriber wouldn't be investing new cash that month, but would turn to the Sale of Stocks section and look to see if any covered stocks in their portfolio were being discontinued and recommended for sale. And then another subscriber would see the biotech stock and be interested in seeing if it might perform better than the large pharma they already own, so they'd compare the current buy/sell prices and projected total return of each stock to see if it makes sense to ""upgrade"" from their overvalued large pharma to the smaller biotech. Finally, we have subscribers that use our selections as springboards for their own due diligence and extended research, and will only make a decision after they have confirmed the analysis and reached their own conclusions. This is what I mean when I say that IAS acts more like a ""research service"" -- it can serve the needs of many different kinds of investors but does require you to make your own decisions instead of investing on autopilot. But we do provide the tools and data and judgment to facilitate the decisionmaking process."
2021-04-28 17:29:18,stocks,"You can download a sample issue from Nate's Notes' website (as well as from the IAS website), and that might give you a better idea of the differences. It looks like Nate's Notes is making multiple buy/sell decisions each month, whereas I would expect that our IAS subscribers are making a handful of buy/sell decisions a year (once they've established their portfolio). IAS is steadfastly devoted to a 5-year horizon, which is a risk management technique that prevents kneejerk decisions and lets company management drive EPS and sales growth over the course of several years.

Cabot is another long-standing newsletter publisher, and they offer several different publications. Their Turnaround Letter uses a value investing approach, which can be successful but also can be very difficult to implement since you are buying stocks that the rest of the market hates. John Buckingham's The Prudent Speculator newsletter is one of the best value newsletters, but returns are prone to swings in underlying sentiment about value vs. growth.

The Buyback Letter has several portfolios that you can follow (if you're looking for income, tech stocks, healthcare/biotech stocks, or the broader market). They also offer a Dogs of the Dow type portfolio -- the Dow 30 stocks that are the most beaten-down (and thus have the highest yields) and are also buying back shares. Personally, I look at stocks that are buying back shares in significant amounts as being a bit troublesome -- it can mean that the stock is in crisis management mode and the board wants to boost the stock, or that the company has too much cash that it doesn't have anything more worthwhile to do with it (such as reinvesting in its business), for instance. As companies have slowed their dividend increases in the last several decades in favor of using cash for share buybacks, I wonder about the overall effectiveness of this approach in the current market and business environment.

Jim Stack's Investech newsletter uses stocks (mostly large-caps), funds, and ETFs in an active strategy. Each month there might be a handful of recommended actions to take, and it's not uncommon for the newsletter to push the portfolio into significant cash levels. (We have a longstanding subscriber to the IAS newsletter who is also a fan of Stack; she manages the portfolio in their household, and at a MoneyShow a few years ago, she made a point of introducing her husband to Stack and instructing her husband that if she should die before him, he should just give all their investing assets to Stack's management service.)

The [HulbertRatings.com](https://HulbertRatings.com) website has returns for 1-year to 30-years for all newsletters that they cover, so that's the best place for an apples-to-apples comparison of results.

What's interesting is that the top-performing newsletters don't represent a single investment style or approach in just about any period. You'll find newsletters that follow growth, value, fundamental, technical, market timing, or income strategies, and that use commodities, ETFs, mutual funds, stocks, and options.

Many newsletters do require constant portfolio action, where each month there might be several changes that they advise subscribers to make; others are more of the ""set it and forget it"" approach. \[Aside: When we say that IAS focuses on the long-term, we mean it -- in November 2020, we recommended buying ADP for the fourth time. The previous recommendations were in May 1997, February 1990, and June 1975. ADP was $2.91 (split-adjusted) in June 1975 and closed yesterday at $195. It's been at least a hold in the newsletter for a very long time.\] But selecting a newsletter that works with your expectations for monthly transactions and strategy can do better for you in the real world than the hypothetical returns in a performance table."

2021-04-28 17:43:30,stocks,"Thank you so much for this detailed overview!

Yeah Nate's is trading a little too often for me, and I don't think the buyback is my style of investing.

Prudent Spectator looks good as well, but so value-focused, and possibly a little too conservative?

Investech looks good but there's so much cash--from what I can see in the sample.

I'm curious as to if you had to subscribe to a second newsletter alongside IAS which one you would subscribe to?"

Its focus is on dividend paying stocks, but from a capital appreciation perspective, not a purely income approach. It is a real ""blue chip"" stock newsletter. 

NoLoadFundX is another well-established mutual fund/ETF newsletter, but it rates hundreds of funds so it can be a bit hard to implement their advice. They do break out funds/ETFs into some portfolios (Aggressive, conservative, total return) that can make things easier."

2021-04-28 10:13:38,stocks,Honestly I do not know because I have never used TDA. You would have to research if they have a mobile app because I have never used it only do my training on the computer. I‚Äôm sure if most brokerages have a mobile app Vanguard probably has one as well.

2021-04-28 11:15:56,stocks,"I have Vanguard as my main brokerage and Roth.. and as of now they do not support fractional shares. To some, that is a huge issue. To me it is not, since i always buy at least 1 share of something.

They are still in the process of upgrading their mobile app. Out of TD, Fidelity and Vanguard, it is Vanguard that is way behind in getting their mobile app on par with the rest of the competition. Their mobile presence is serviceable at best.

I went with Vanguard as I just trust them with my finances. No regrets but it would be nice to have a more modern touch to the mobile app.

2021-04-28 19:51:17,stocks,"Yes, I believe so comparing the two is kinda apples to oranges. We are in the largest bull run in history (which is why I would say that he is down). 

Berkshire has something crazy like $125 billion to $150 billion in cash on hand. They only have a p/e of 15. They have a very strong core of investments in great companies with great average cost per share. WB focuses on dividend stocks, so they have a great cash flow. He really hasn‚Äôt made any moves recently because of the bull run. He has and will always wait for a bear market. In addition to all of those points. Most people who have Berkshire shares don‚Äôt sell them so it‚Äôs hard for price movement with little to no volume. IN ADDITION to that, the class A shares have to be sold as whole shares and they are over $400k a share right now. 

TLDR yes, he has lost to the s&p for the last 10 years as we test ATHs. But, he is waiting for the next downturn or crash to make a huge move. But to take the last 10 years as comparative to the last 50+ is kinda foolish."

2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"APPH and down the line opportunities to grow cannabis? I‚Äôll start off by saying I saw NO NEWS ARTICLES OR ANYTHING suggesting this can or will happen, nor do I think it will. I just know from experience that there are a few similarities between growing tomato plants and growing cannabis plants. I am just wondering if anyone else believes it‚Äôs reasonable to speculate that down the line if the US decides to federally legalize or make some dramatic reform to the cannabis laws in America, would APPH be in a advantageous situation to transition a small part of their operation into possibly growing cannabis?  If they already have the vertical farming in place, climate controlled, I would think it would give them a good starting point to begin growing quality cannabis.  Please don‚Äôt destroy me for this but I am just really curious if I‚Äôm the only one who has thought about it.

EDIT:  Just wanted to throw in that regardless of what happens I believe APPH is poised for growth. Even if they were to branch off into the cannabis market (which again, I do not anticipate) I believe that vegetable farming should and will remain their primary focus."

I made a post about it a while ago, but the TL:DR was that it will be big tobacco that wins out on legalization.  They know their industry is dying, they have the fields, the have the politicians.  It could be announced today and they could have products in every gas station in the US by August.  Any company unable to raise at least 1 billion dollars for start up will be quickly pushed out of the market and I promise you it will be designed to not allow any imports for at least the first 10 years"
2021-04-28 09:12:44,stocks,I feel this will likely depend on the regulations that get built around the industry.

2021-04-28 12:42:28,stocks,"Honest question: do you think demand will run out for tomatoes or weed (once its legalized and companies start producing globally) first? 

I'd be concerned with the margin pressures that, on one side you have pressure to make either a better product or the cheapest product even cheaper. The other side pressure on margins is that which is brought about by regulations (watch for Texas being the state with the least regulatory headwinds). With those pressures coming from both sides I'd be surprised if it doesn't bring the margins you get for weed down to the same you get for special tomatoes. Even though you'd pay more in the aggregate for weed. 

APPH has the experience and the infrastructure. Perhaps the funding after their offering."
2021-04-28 11:32:28,stocks,"I get your point but if it was that easy for Big Tobacco giants to enter new industries they would have done it and continued to succeed already in places where legalisation currently exists.

2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"Asking for portfolio allocation advice Hi, I am a 20-year-old student who is interested in long-term investment for financial freedom. While studying economics and finance during my years in college, I realized that there is no definite answer when it comes to forming a portfolio. I tried to use the efficient frontier model I learned from one of the lectures to analyze historical price data and maximize sharp ratios, but there were a lot of limitations. The portfolio didn't seem to include stocks that have not enough data or underperformed the market but seem to have upside potential.

Now I am wondering what method I should use to allocate my assets. I am currently looking into data analysis & security intelligence-related stocks/ETFs(CGNT, BAH, SPLK, LHK, IBM, PLTR, CIBR etc.) since I'm pursuing my career in related fields and safe assets(GLD, GOVT) for portfolio hedging purpose.

How do y'all allocate your assets and form a portfolio? And regarding my stock choices, is there any advice you can provide to me? Any advice would be appreciated."
2021-04-28 09:04:08,stocks,"The thing with using the efficient frontier to find an allocation is that it is based on historic data. Furthermore, based on my adventures with the efficient frontier, it's a bit too static for these types of markets plus you need too many constraints to get something reasonable. My suggestion would be to allocate 80-90% into broad indexes (in your case, mostly stocks, maybe some corporate bonds as well) and use the rest (10-20%) for investments that interest you like the ones you have stated plus the hedging investments."
2021-04-28 09:12:27,stocks,"I hold essentially total market index funds with a slight weighting toward value and small-cap stocks for enhanced long term returns. If you're looking to truly build wealth you should start with a base of total market index funds and only do stock picking with a small portion of your total portfolio especially because you're new and will likely make mistakes. 

A good way to start would be to just throw everything you have into VTI and start a paper trading account to get the hang of how the markets work in the real world. I know it can be unsatisfying because you're excited and want to jump in, but your money is still growing just fine in VTI. If you start doing well with the paper trading then consider starting to pick individual stocks."

In terms of picking specific stocks there is no one right way. Just have to find a company in the whatever space and research to make sure they know their shit and have a good plan. But even then they could end up belly up. 

If you are interested in long term financial freedom then invest in some big name ETFs (VOO, QQQ, etc) and with ETFs based on those different sectors. Throw in some big names with great dividends and you should be on your way."
2021-04-28 10:52:18,stocks,"I‚Äôm still relatively new to investing but my current goals for my stock portfolio regarding allocation/diversification include: I aim for 60% of holdings and money invested into US stocks, 25% in foreign stocks and 15% in ETFs. More recently I have been trying to focus on stocks with a proven track record while also having a decent (everyone‚Äôs opinion is different) dividend return. The biggest mistake I made in the beginning was choosing stocks based off an emotional impulse rather than a logical deduction. Mentally think about where you‚Äôd want to cut your losses at to stop the bleeding and reallocate the remaining funds into a winner or something new. Good luck!"
2021-04-28 11:04:43,stocks,I look at the efficient frontier in the same way as the black scholes model or really any modern portfolio theory stuff. Some of it makes sense and does work but our markets are quite different from when these tools were created in the 1950‚Äôs. For example there are some hedge funds that will include efficient frontiers to show their clients how much alpha they are going to generate! Only to have 8 different betas and finish the year in the red. I would say portfolio construction depends entirely on how much risk you are happy with taking. If you want a little risk than I would say get an etf that tracks the s&p. If you want a lot of risk than pick only a handful of companies. I think diversification should get a lot of your attention if you want to smooth out your returns but true diversification has been getting harder and harder since almost every asset move together.

2021-04-28 15:43:30,stocks,"The last 2-3 years have been like so:

* 50% cash (well... originally... the gains this year made it lopsided)
* 20% blue chip non-cyclical (I call them anchors)
* 10% dividend stocks for dry powder (REITs - healthcare and maybe residential once  they get pounded by end of covid moratorium), and some preferred stock
* 10% high growth established big companies (costco, sbux, etc)
* 10% speculative high growth 

The percentages are doubled when the cash is eventually deployed but right now I feel the markets are over priced, hence, 50% cash originally. For the record, its currently about 30% cash in my portfolio as other positions have grown.

General performance the last 2-3 years:

* Total gains since 2019 have been over 300%
* Total gains in 2020 were slightly over 200%"

For example, I buy 6000 shares of ABC Stock at $3.50 per share and then once the price reaches $38 per share I sell $6,000 worth of stock to capture back my initial investment.

Now, assuming this all happened in a couple months and not years, would I have to pay capital gains?"

2021-04-28 08:59:17,stocks,Yes. Every time you sell your stock; it creates a taxable event.
2021-04-28 09:02:30,stocks,"Yes, because you'd be selling the shares at a profit (i.e. capital gains)."
2021-04-28 09:01:29,stocks,Do you mean 6000 shares at $3.50? And to answer your question you are taxed on your gains per share. So if you then sell $21000 at $38.00 per share you would be taxes on (38-3.5) = $34.50 per share.
2021-04-28 09:05:01,stocks,"You would pay taxes on the $34.50 ($38-$3.50) worth of gains per share on each share you sold. It would take about 158 shares to get the $6k. You'd have $5,451 (158*$34.50) worth of realized taxable gains. I am not a tax advisor, this is not financial advice."
2021-04-28 09:15:26,stocks,Is your question related to selling in dollars on Robinhood? I can see how you would think it wouldn‚Äôt matter but since each share is now worth more that means you‚Äôd sell less shares. You may have to pay capital gains tax. But idk I‚Äôm not an accountant don‚Äôt listen to me
2021-04-28 09:21:15,stocks,Yes
2021-04-28 09:33:43,stocks,"Well, first off if you bought 21,000 shares at $3.50 per share it would cost you $73,500...not $6k...

But, Yes you will owe taxes on the gain. You aren‚Äôt just withdrawing your original investment out, you are selling $6k worth of individual stocks. Except this time you have to sell a lot less stock than you originally bought. So each stock is now worth more, so on each one you sell you make $34.50 profit (38 - 3.50) and you have to pay taxes on $34.50 multiplied by however many you sell."
2021-04-28 09:39:55,stocks,"it's calculated on the gain per share.

since your numbers are kinda messed up i'll use an example:

you bought 100 shares @ $1/share

price rises and now it's valued @ $2/share

by your example, you would sell 50 shares @ $2 to retrieve your initial cost base of $100, however you will be taxed on the $50 gain you made (50 shares x ($2 - $1) )

2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"Some thoughts on the PINS results Disclaimer: I'm long PINS - in fact it's one of my highest conviction holdings.  

There's a fair bit of confusion about the stock dropping so much in light of a big earnings beat, so I thought I would provide some thoughts for any other longs or potential buyers.  In addition to the raw numbers, I've also combed through the earnings call transcript to pick out some interesting tidbits that don't necessarily get reported.

All in all the numbers were absolutely fantastic:

* Quarterly revenue up 78% YoY to $485M, beating the $474M forecast
* Adjusted EPS 11 cents vs 7 cents forecast
* Monthly active users up 30% to 478M with strong growth in the under 25 age demographic
* ARPU $1.04 vs $0.99 forecast
* Guiding for Q2 revenue growth of 105% YoY,  better than the 95% analyst expectations
* Product searches grew 20x YoY, indicating significant growth in people using the platform for shopping and not just for search
* 200% growth YoY in Pinners engaging with shopping surfaces, also demonstrating significant growth in the e-commerce side of the platform
* Shopify integration expanded to 27 additional countries
* Seeing good uptake on Story Pins, which functions differently than stories on Instagram. Story Pins allows users to show someone how to do something from beginning to end, such as cook a recipe or renovate a bathroom.
* International business grew 170% YoY and now comprises 20% of total revenue

So why is the stock off so much given such fantastic numbers?  Because of one single item: Monthly active users of 478M fell short of expectations for 480M, largely because growth in the US was flat.  Here's what the company said:

""As pandemic lockdowns were eased in some parts of the world during mid-March, we began to see signs of less engagement and user growth on Pinterest, and we assume this means people are spending more time off-line. While it's impossible to say how people act as we enter the summer months, we anticipate this trend will continue.""

**My thoughts**

Short-term investors are overreacting to the MAU concern by interpreting it as, ""Uh oh, I guess PINS is just another stay-at-home stock. Time to bail.""  But this is a mistake.  Some amount of pull-forward is totally expected.  If people are stuck at home, they're going to spend more time online.  We also know people spent more time doing things like redecorating and renovating or learning to cook, the kinds of things that drive engagement with Pinterest.  But that doesn't mean we will start to see a decline in usage once COVID is over.  People will react to the end of lockdowns by catching up on all the things they couldn't do before: travel, socialize, gather outside the home, etc.  But eventually life will get back to pre-covid normal and behavior will swing back to a more normal balance.  The same factors that drove usage growth and engagement with Pinterest before covid will continue to drive it in the future.  This is partly because people actually use Pinterest in an active way, they don't just scroll through it as a time-waster when they have nothing else to do."

2021-04-28 09:00:02,stocks,"I too am long on PINS. I did get myself into what seems to be some trouble entering into LEAPs on PINS yesterday before earnings. Wasn‚Äôt expecting such a gap. 

But I agree with this sentiment 100%. It is disheartening to see analysts lower their price targets. The thing which is frustrating with this current gap down is PINS growth internationally, and seems investors are just taking a blind eye to that."
2021-04-28 10:36:22,stocks,"Agreed. MAUs is not the best metric to judge PINS given it already has over half a billion users and growing. The way the platform is, I highly doubt it will see FB/Instagram type MAUs. The name of the game is monetizing their userbase, and it looks like they are doing that and doing that well. 


I suspect we will trade sideways for the next quarter. If by some chance we dip below $60/share, I'll buy even more stock. I've bene in since the IPO, added in the teens last year, and still believe in the future of this company."
2021-04-28 15:05:50,stocks,"Buying this dip kinda feels like free money when you actually look at all the details.  I don't see any logical reason for a 15% (!!) dip given their earnings.

Wait that‚Äôs not how it works? The internet will still be around once the lockdown ends? Well golly, I suppose these internet based companies might continue to earn some revenue then!"

2021-04-28 12:29:01,stocks,"I originally bought into PINS when it was in the high teens to low twenties and I loved the company back then at it's valuation, it was undervalued given their growth imo, and now with a 13% drop I'm toying with the idea of buying more, but it mentally hurts to buy more after it's already tripled haha. Still deciding though. 13% dip is nice :)."

2021-04-28 17:41:52,stocks,I hope this goes down to 50s. Will add lot more to my position. Easy long term hold as they are still at very early stage when it comes to monetization. I expect their top to grow at furious pace in next several years. This will be a $100 stock in next 2 years for sure.

2021-04-28 09:24:17,stocks,"Pinterest has held up pretty well to this point.  It was always going to have to go up against tough comps for a period.  I'd expected bumpiness for a while.  Flipping to profitability might help in the near future.

I was pretty happy with the projected revenue growth numbers."
2021-04-28 15:41:33,stocks,"This is a very rough estimate so stick with me here:

* Market cap of $42 billion (according to Google), 
* Forward revenues of $1b per quarter (estimate based on management guidance), 
* $4 billion of revenue for 2022 (Again, estimate based on management guidance)  

This gives them a 10x P/S for 2022 revenues. How is this attractive exactly? I don't see why people are bullish on this stock.

ENPH has similar forward revenues as PINS, but they trade at a market cap of $20 billion, and their business is more insulated from the idea of being a ""covid"" trade."

2021-04-28 10:59:54,stocks,"Agreed back at you.

I think part of the problem is way too many investors still see this as a social media company, and compare it to FB, Insta, Twitter, Snap.  But it isn't social media.  It's visual search and social commerce.  People don't spend time on Pinterest every day the way they do on the other sites because the point of Pinterest isn't to engage with other people socially.  People use it for inspiration, and more and more for shopping."

2021-04-28 15:50:39,stocks,"You need to talk to more women and you probably won't find many here.

Pinterest is incredibly popular with women. Which is one of the reasons that I like investing in it. Most investors are men so the stuff that women become obsessed with tend to fly under the radar for a while. So anytime that I see that women have become obsessed with something that most guys just don't get yet, I start thinking about what investments I can make to benefit from that and Pinterest is definitely a big one.

I used to think about Pinterest the same way that you do and would get frustrated every time that an image would take me to the Pinterest signup page. But then after seeing how obsessed women were with it, I created an account and did a deep dive into it to find out why women love it so much. Then I understood and invested in it."

I ABSOLUTELY felt this was when I was in middle school/high school and had to look up images for a powerpoint presentation.. After researching the company last year when I bought into it though, I've come to change my perspective on the company a lot. 

It's definitely not a facebook or a youtube/google, but it's definitely in a different category than a snapchat or a twitter. Their revenue growth is insane, it's a very sticky platform (as is all social media I suppose), their monthly active users is among the highest in the world outside of Chinese companies (probably top 3-5 in NA/EU), but their main focus needs to be growing their revenue per user right now. There's already studies that ads on Pinterest are more cost effective than on Facebook, which atm is the go to for low budget advertising, which is definitely a huge benefit for Pinterest in the long run I believe. Their entrance into the ecommerce space is also very bullish long term. Of course they're not going to topple Amazon, but there's still plenty of space to compete in the industry."
2021-04-28 15:35:21,stocks,"I know that mental barrier you speak of! I think it's very common and my perspective now is that I'm just padding my winners. So even though it may feel like you missed out adding more to your position when it was 1.5x or 2.x, just imagine that in the future you don't want to look back and feel bad that you didn't add at 3x when it's now 4x or 5x. You're getting a discount, past discounts are long gone and who knows if there will be future discounts.

And once you build that habit of adding to your winners from time to time, it gets easier to do each time. Hope that helps."

Nothing new to be honest, it was clear since last year that their future is international growth (user and monetization). I'm bullish as long as those ARPU numbers internationally keeps going up as they have been. It's so low rn that it should double every year for the next 3-4 years at least (plus US ARPU increase but not expecting it to double as it's much higher).

2021-04-28 13:13:17,stocks,"Yes, these are YoY numbers which is why they're projecting zero US MAU growth for next quarter.  That would mark the 4th straight quarter of 98M monthly users in the US."

They've just rolled out Story Pins, which would allow me to watch a quick video of someone making the recipe I want (sort of like you see on TikTok).  In the future I might be able to sign up for a cooking class right through Pinterest.

When they're projecting revenue growth of 100% despite guiding for a decrease in MAU growth, that says something."
2021-04-28 19:29:10,stocks,Hope you're right. But even during the calls they said with covid easing there's less users in the future so we'll see.

Advertisers love the fact that there is no negativity and controversy surrounding Pinterest, and the ads fit seamlessly into their platform (unlike FB and others where the ads are annoying).

let's say this is true. ok, you're now holding millions of dollars of cash and you invest into...what? everything requires capital gains taxes so what are you gonna do, just hold cash? congrats, you lose to inflation. and in this current fed fueled economic boom, you can bet no one wants to miss out on the ride.

They don‚Äôt have the monetary value of gold and silver, are far more rare than them and used heavily in industry for combating climate change. Think catalytic converters, etc. With the new emphasis on reducing carbon both platinum and palladium are well positioned for the next few years. Also the pandemic and  down turn in the automobile industry has put platinum in a strong buy position. Furthermore, platinum has historically had a higher value than gold it is now around $500 less per ounce. Don‚Äôt believe me go to www.TradingView.com and make your own chart comparing platinum CFD to gold CFD and see for yourself. There are two areas you could explore 1.miners: check out $NILSY $IMPUY and $SBSW ( this one has options , I like LEAPS üòä)

This is known as ""crowdfunding"" -- instead of raising capital by listing on a stock exchange, a company sells shares directly to individuals. Typically, purchasers are customers who become more engaged after they buy into the program, and the company encourages this with the perks that they offer to those who purchase shares.

There is no secondary market for the shares, so it's difficult if not impossible to sell your shares once purchased. In theory, if the company eventually does list on a stock exchange, your shares would be transferred or exchanged for shares on the public market.

As an ""investment,"" it's probably hard to analyze Brewdog compared to other publicly-traded companies and come up with any really compelling reason to buy shares. But if you are a craft beer lover and have cash that you don't need for anything more compelling, it can be a fun way to connect with the company and have a chance that it might pay off financially somewhere down the road."

I have ordered tons from them in the last one year and they were doing a lot of one-off promotions (free deliveries etc) so I guess that really contributes to user growth. Without the promotions and now that there is no more lockdown I haven't ordered once. Not to mention they had no competition here (Hungary, small market), Wolt arrived later while Bolt Food is just appearing here. Really not sure about other countries."
2021-04-28 07:46:45,stocks,"In general, I am not very bullish on these delivery platforms. Those are platform business models which are easy to replicate. The competition is very high in this segment. Delivery Hero was listed in the DAX30 but was laughed about because it never generated any profits and spends most of its money on advertisement."
2021-04-28 08:02:00,stocks,"My concern with all delivery platforms, like Deliveroo, is that they're experiencing a boom because of the pandemic. Once restaurants open up across the globe, how much will these businesses take a hit?"
2021-04-28 08:13:06,stocks,"Biggest winner since covid happened a year ago.
How is this a hidden gem ? Theres to many competition in germany.
Demand will decrease as soon as covid disappears in some years."
2021-04-28 08:21:53,stocks,Also one should know that they are facing a lot of backlash for how they are treating their workers (delivery drivers)
2021-04-28 07:57:30,stocks,"Firstly it's  not hidden , secondly and that's my own opinion,  I wouldn't touch any delivery Service stock for multiple reasons . They couldn't turn a profit in the perfect conditions for them what else should benefit them to turn a profit ? Also last mile delivery will always be very expensive, imagine the minimum wage goes up 2-3 euro in germany so they would have to get the customer to pay this because the margins are so thin . A lot of people would jump ship and start cooking by themselves or getting their food by themselves. Also restaurants often have their own delivery drivers. I also think they'll face headwinds when everybody is vaccinated . I really want to go to a restaurant again in person and all of my friends too so the orders will definitely not go up . Lastly where is the moat , everyone can deliver food and design a website there is also no brand loyalty like with apple or sony etc. as if people would  care who brings them the food if someone can do it cheaper bye bye delivery hero and competition will get harder a race to the bottom who will have the cheapest service , ok i admit they somehow have a network effect here but i just don't see this as a long term investment to much trouble and question marks . Im a bear when it comes to last mile delivery stuff it's so work intensive and barely gets you any money . Valuation is also bonkers for a company like this"
2021-04-28 07:29:19,stocks,"In any case, they are the market leader in Germany in terms of food delivery (I ordered something there last night). To be honest, I don't see how they can make money in the long term. The food hardly costs more than in a restaurant, and there are no delivery costs. So they can only earn money at the expense of the restaurant. Meanwhile, however, there is the trend that more and more restaurants offer their own delivery service (in Austria and Germany at least) to reduce the fee. They simply put flyers with their food advertising their own cheaper service.

Now apart from the business model: the share was included in the DAX a year ago, so it is well-known in europe. That also gave the stock a boost, similar to the S&P 500 inclusion of Tesla. To be honest, the share is very expensive, and the company is not profitable either. Personally, I would be cautious, but if anyone has a more positive vision of the future of food delivery, Delivery Hero is certainly one of the better ones in the industry."
2021-04-28 09:28:38,stocks,"If you believe that a food consumption revolution is happening, then these delivery companies will be a good bet. If you don't think there will be a revolution, don't buy in. One thing I will say, there are more and more houses being built without kitchens !"
2021-04-28 09:55:09,stocks,They only grow that strong due to covid...and this is over soon. Next year will not be good for them...

2021-04-28 07:43:44,stocks,It seems they moving into the Asian market.
2021-04-28 09:26:42,stocks,The question you need to ask is why does every reputable investment fund have meituan in their portfolio? And a large percentage at that.
2021-04-28 08:16:07,stocks,"Lol I don‚Äôt normally invest in the European market, just saw this deal and thought it was interesting and I don‚Äôt live in Europe. Guess my ignorance is showing."
2021-04-28 08:23:23,stocks,As do most deliveries tbh
2021-04-28 08:07:26,stocks,Thank you. That‚Äôs interesting. I like to look at numbers than peoples opinions. The numbers look right. But there seems to be a lot of underlying issues.
2021-04-28 09:25:31,stocks,"You forget habit. People will continue to order out of habit and convenience. Who is to say that delivery hero and the like, might start to produce their own foods?"
2021-04-28 09:49:42,stocks,"They are listed in the DAX 30 (German Stock exchange) but they don't have business in Germany, they sold everything because of too small margins. So increasing the minimum wage will not effect their business.
Delivering food is only one side, they're focusing on q-commerce now:

2021-04-28 11:10:23,stocks,Any reasons why you say this?
2021-04-28 09:12:31,stocks,They can't compete with meituan
2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"A farewell gift from Bezos? Even if it theoretically has no impact on the value of a share, I would still be pretty excited if there was an Amazon stock split. With Tesla and Apple, it still boosted the prices last summer. Amazon's stock is close to an all-time high right now and would definitely be boosted by such news.

However, I once heard that Jeff Bezos didn't want a stock that was too cheap because he was worried that the stock would become a plaything of retail investors. What do you think is the likelihood of a stock split? 

Position: 8 Amazon shares"
2021-04-28 06:28:47,stocks,"I thought the same thing. The fact that he hasn‚Äôt wanted it, but is leaving definitely opens the door to a split. And I feel like there are more than enough people that still think that splitting stocks adds value to your position that it could drive the price up a bit more. 

My other thought was how many brokerages offer partial shares? I don‚Äôt have access, but I think a lot of us platforms do. Maybe people have already bought the part of a share they can afford in this way."
2021-04-28 08:26:38,stocks,I get the fractional share counter argument to a stock split but aren‚Äôt stock splits still good for options? It‚Äôs easier for people to start accumulating shares and then gives more flexibility to start selling puts/calls
2021-04-28 07:48:35,stocks,He has a good point about retail investors. Although I‚Äôm not quite sure that‚Äôs who drives most of the fuckery on the markets.
2021-04-28 11:52:10,stocks,plot twist: it's gonna be a reverse split
2021-04-28 06:30:17,stocks,A 5/1 split would be awesome
2021-04-28 06:35:51,stocks,"I think it's a possibility. 

AMZN might be valued at between 4500-6000 in the year or two

Plus the DOW"
2021-04-28 09:47:53,stocks,"So I actually 100% disagree that him leaving as CEO has any influence on probability of a stock split. He is no longer the CEO, but he still maintains his spot as the executive chairman of the board.

The board, at every single company, are the ones who will make that executive decision and Jeff will maintain that role. So if his fundamental belief was that a stock split = retail traders abusing the stock, he probably still maintains that belief. 

All of that said, a stock split would be awesome from my perspective and I'd immediately purchase more."
2021-04-28 12:31:44,stocks,"2 years ago I was waiting for a dip on Amazon and google. Don‚Äôt try to time the market. I was smart enough to buy some Tesla early so that one worked out at least. 

What they say about trying to time the market is true.

If it splits I think it is going to shoot up even higher."
2021-04-28 11:37:24,stocks,bezos doesnt give gifts.
2021-04-28 09:02:46,stocks,Meanwhile fractional share holders: 'its already our plaything'
2021-04-28 11:32:45,stocks,"Stock splits only ""technically"" do not impact the price. In reality, especially nowadays, it has a pretty large impact on options activity which in turn can drive up stock prices as various load and unload shares to hedge."
2021-04-28 09:27:27,stocks,"A was reading recently some articles about top managers leaving Amazon. Reason mentioned was that base pay was max at around $200,000 plus RSUs. Ratio was around 20% base pay, 80% pay in RSUs. Making VP annual around $1,000,000 in average while they can make 4-5 times at the same level at other companies. However, due that high amount of RSU%, it would be a smart move to increase their annual payment by simply splitting the stock. Costs nothing, drives share prices, increases annual pay of top managers. Reduces attrition. If I could do that, I would."
2021-04-28 09:56:29,stocks,"Imo, he was right about the ‚Äúplaything.‚Äù The quality of a shareholder in a stock thats traded at 3000 vs 300, even if they have the exact same market cap. Is drastic"
2021-04-28 11:34:58,stocks,"So companies usually choose to split their shares so they can lower the trading price of their stock to a range that is deemed comfortable by investors. In this case, retail investors. However, given Jeff's previous posturing, another reason: perhaps to increase liquidity of the shares, might be a more compelling reason.  One has to wonder how a stock split might help Amazon meet a strategic goal. Alternatively, given that it is not uncommon for a stock to get a post split boost, would Jeff's compensation change for achieving a % increase per share target?"
2021-04-28 11:33:32,stocks,"I don't think it's common outside the US to provide partial shares so being in Canada, that's one of my biggest barriers to buying shares. With the conversion and everything, it's difficult for me to save the funds to buy 1 share when I can buy something else and get more ROI sooner.

Had 3 shares pre-covid and then took some profits post boom and put that into Tesla and I don't want to take those funds out because they are also still growing"
2021-04-28 06:56:23,stocks,I hope your 8 splits into 240
2021-04-28 12:35:25,stocks,I‚Äôd rather no split. Reduced volatility in the share price
2021-04-28 06:34:37,stocks,How about we get dividends
2021-04-28 10:46:14,stocks,"I'm in the same boat with my thinking. However if there is a split, I see them waiting until it's around the $5k-$6k mark to bring it back down to $2,500-$3,000. I don't think we'll see a split at $4k leaving it at $2k or below since I do see retail investors getting in if it's that cheap. I'd be surprised if there's a split in the next few years, but could see it in 5-10 years if it gets a little too expensive."
2021-04-28 10:53:32,stocks,Bezos isn‚Äôt going anywhere. He‚Äôs just hiring a CEO.
2021-04-28 15:13:19,stocks,"All in Amazon since last year sold at last years high, bought again this year many options 95% depot. I would be extremly happy about this split, i know no more value for the company but this makes the stock for many more affordable and gives a cheap look on the stock."
2021-04-28 15:43:41,stocks,Maybe he will do a reverse stock split....once more middle finger from Bezos to the little guy before he goes lol
2021-04-28 16:12:38,stocks,A split at 4k will still put it out of the realm of a lot of retail who can barely buy Tesla options. I'm not worried about it.
2021-04-28 11:59:01,stocks,Fractional shares. All the kids are doing it.
2021-04-28 08:18:50,stocks,"No stock split please. The PER is already high. If there is a 10/1 or 20/1 stock split, so, AMZN would be overbought. High risk of bubble."
2021-04-28 12:22:12,stocks,"Long time Amazon holder here. Personally, I don't care if the stock price splits. Other than the last few months, Amazon has been pretty volatile over time. A split would introduce further volatility through retail investors, which I'm not sure would benefit the stock long term.

While I do agree that more investor interest would drive higher prices, I do like the philosophy of restricting ownership to committed investors / institutions. Kinda like BRK.A, but way cheaper ;)"
2021-04-28 10:14:12,stocks,"I can think of 2 angles. If the stock splits it will go up and increase Bezos‚Äô own net worth. Second he can distribute the stock amongst the employees more easily if it is priced lower. Given all the focus amazon has been getting, it will not be a bad move to share the stock gains with the rank and file employees. I hope it splits. 30:1 would be nice"
2021-04-28 10:09:42,stocks,Either a Split or a Dividend should happen soon
2021-04-28 09:10:33,stocks,This would open up options as a possibility for a lot more retail investors.
2021-04-28 12:23:01,stocks,I just appreciate that you led of with the understanding that a split does nothing for the capitalization. Thank you.
2021-04-28 13:29:28,stocks,Bezos feels himself entitled so he doesn't want simple peasants like us to have a share of his book store company :(
2021-04-28 10:08:14,stocks,Splitting doesn't create value for anyone but the bank doing the transaction. Just look at what buffets done. You can also buy fractional shares now (at least in the US)
2021-04-28 10:39:55,stocks,"Just buy fractional shares, split just makes it easier to manipulate"
2021-04-28 10:11:15,stocks,Now's not the time with Amazon at all time high. They are better off keeping this cheap trick in their back pocket for when there's a major drawdown.
2021-04-28 14:05:09,stocks,I don‚Äôt get the hype on stock splits. Why do people get hype from them? It‚Äôs like exchanging a dollar for 2x 50c. You aren‚Äôt any richer before or after. With fractional shares too anyone can get in the game?
2021-04-28 09:41:49,stocks,"Isn‚Äôt he still on the board? The CEO doesn‚Äôt make stock split decisions, IIRC"

2021-04-28 14:21:40,stocks,"It would almost certainly cause the stock value to increase dramatically. Rumor was 10/1.  I'd say it isn't super likely, but we can hope. Dow is a big plus too."
2021-04-28 14:46:12,stocks,I be more happy with splitting Amazon and AWS.
2021-04-28 15:04:52,stocks,I hope it splits

2021-04-28 10:46:14,stocks,I can bet Institutional investors hold at least 80% of $AMZN shares. Retail barely holds 10%. Where is this rumour coming out Bezos is not keen on a stock split? This isn't a GME like situation
2021-04-28 16:23:26,stocks,Wish Amazon would acquire GME and AMC so us apes that have been holding all become millionaires.
2021-04-28 09:17:20,stocks,Curious why amazon has never split? Anyone know?
2021-04-28 12:13:06,stocks,"I own amazon and i dont want a share split.  I think amazon is undervalued. So is google and fb.  Gives me more opportunity to slowly accumulate.  A lot of ppl dont get it.  U want ur shares to be undervalued til u decide to sell.  Red days are good days for a young investor.

I thought share split was stupid until i saw apple and tesla run up because of algos and retail.  I own apple but im not buying anymore."
2021-04-28 12:03:27,stocks,AAPL hasn‚Äôt done shit since the split

2021-04-28 13:14:08,stocks,It's going to be interesting tomorrow. All the talking heads on CNBC are acting as if this split is a foregone conclusion and Amazon will replace Intel in the DOW.
2021-04-28 14:34:50,stocks,"5-to-1 stock split would be nice, and would likely still keep it out of reach for the vast majority of retail investors to play options on it."
2021-04-28 06:35:27,stocks,"You are right with the partial shares thing. My broker for example does not offer it, but I guess most in the US do. I think the split has two effects: enabling more people to buy it (could be offset by partial shares) and the optics of a lower price (rather perception bias)."
2021-04-28 13:50:31,stocks,Splitting the stock could also prepare it for inclusion in the DJIA.
2021-04-28 08:09:32,stocks,"But see, it does matter. Options for retail on Amazon aren't viable without a huge account. Theta gang is even worse. I dont buy shares in numbers other than 100. If they split down to 100 a share I would be happy to buy 100k worth of shares to sell options on, but to own shares now would be too large of a % on my account to be enticing"

2021-04-28 15:40:35,stocks,"I don‚Äôt think very many people genuinely believe that a stock split adds to your overall value.

2021-04-28 08:56:56,stocks,I think this is one of the reasons that Bezos has been reluctant to split the shares. He doesn‚Äôt want speculators creating volatility in the stock.
2021-04-28 19:25:47,stocks,"You can buy call/put warrants which can have 0,01 ratio already."
2021-04-28 10:41:47,stocks,"Agreed on the second point! Hedge funds toy with markets to make money, then when there‚Äôs volatility, they blame everyday investors."
2021-04-28 12:31:53,stocks,"The main problem is options. Splits would make options much more viable, and the market as of late has been driven by options, as opposed to what it should be where options are driven by the market.

2021-04-28 10:49:58,stocks,"This.

I think it's about as likely as ever, which is to say, unlikely.

There was a point that I thought something like a 3:1 would make sense, because the share price might have still been ""high enough"" for Jeff, but the longer we go without a split the less likely that seems, unless something like AMZN hitting 5600 happens.

I have 3 shares of AMZN in my portfolio, and I think a split would be a good thing, but I dont think it will happen while Jeff is on the board."
2021-04-28 14:29:22,stocks,"> I'd immediately purchase more.

Would you buy a plurality of shares, hm...?"
2021-04-28 12:39:45,stocks,"Yeah, you never get really great companies like AMZN, AAPL etc ‚Äûcheap‚Äú. They rarely are on sale. I just stopped trying to get a good price"

2021-04-28 08:03:05,stocks,I‚Äôd prefer share repo.
2021-04-28 10:29:39,stocks,No thanks. I'd rather Amazon continue to invest in growing its business. I also don't care to have the tax liability of dividends.
2021-04-28 06:37:03,stocks,As Amazon can't really buy a high enough dividend to call it a dividend stock (at least 3%) I would just don't pay out anything through dividends.
2021-04-28 11:08:20,stocks,PER isn't inherently affected by a stock split.
2021-04-28 08:55:37,stocks,"I agree. I would prefer no split, as I think the high price keeps the volatility and potential overselling in check."
2021-04-28 11:05:53,stocks,"The entire economy is in a bubble, brought on by excessive money not being spent, but invested. 

In two years, alot of money will come out and amazon will drop in price. If there is no split, the stock will drop below 2800/share. From static numbers, it's less than 20%. With inflation, its around 30-40% value. I'll give you this example using Tesla. If you extrapolate the current price to before the split, it's gone from 4k per share to 7k per share in a company with earnings that arent close to its valuation. Amazon gets alot closer.

Let's say you have 10 now, worth 33k. A 10 to 1 gives you 100, still worth 33k. Initially the price drops from sales of extra stock by people who dont want the over saturation. But its bought by those wanting more exposure. After a month or two, the prices go back to the start and increase. By 6 months later, your 100 shares are worth 450-500 per. Your valuation is now 45-50k. The price fluctuates but you still have a close valuation. As the price rises over time, you increase net worth. In 10 years, you stand to lose thousands upon thousands from not splitting.

Amazon is not Berkshire Hathaway class A. Bezos is not Warren Buffett."
2021-04-28 11:44:36,stocks,"I wouldn't mind a 3/1 split.

That seems to be a barrier to keep out riff raff and be slightly more accessible."

2021-04-28 10:27:07,stocks,A dividend is very unlikely. Amazon is notorious for reinvesting all its profits into growing the business.

2021-04-28 14:55:43,stocks,What would AMZN without AWS be worth?

Take a look at this if you have some time to kill please. Scroll down until you find my ‚Äúfake name here‚Äù discussion with a guy names ‚Äúatillia‚Äù (about halfway down) about stock splits. I was genuinely confused at the end of the discussion who was saying what. Let me know what you think. 

Too long, didn‚Äôt click - the guy thought his stock split added a huge amount to his value and I could not convince him otherwise, even with links to the stock price history he was quoting."

2021-04-28 19:56:04,stocks,"That's possible but a little misleading because of the RSU's. That 165k is just a piece of the pie. Amazon looks at total compensation and once those stocks start vesting they really get their claws into you. It is really hard to walk away from. When I started the stock was around 1k. A 300% increase is a pretty sweet bump. There aren't many managers leaving Amazon because of the money. Work/life balance maybe, but not money. 

To stay on topic. I would welcome a hefty split but I doubt it will happen. I would look for a substantial raise for the Tier 1's really soon though. They sure as hell deserve it and Amazon is losing its wage advantage. It's really starting to show with the amount of no-shows for orientation days."
2021-04-28 10:20:17,stocks,"Relax, it would be considerably more difficult to swing trade Amazon at 3400+ than at 340. I use the term ‚Äúhigh quality share holder‚Äù the same way Buffet uses it. It‚Äôs not a jab at you or anyone else"

2021-04-28 11:28:37,stocks,"Totally agree.  Amazon doesn't do buybacks or dividends.  They reinvest back in the company, and I'd say their track record on investment has been incredible so far."
2021-04-28 13:00:45,stocks,"Taxes are a silly reason to be averse to dividends assuming you live in the US. Your brokerage will provide you with 1099-DIV form with all the info you need. If your total taxable income is less than $40K you pay no taxes on dividends. If it's between $40K and $440k it's 15%.

Fuck reinvestments, I'd rather have the money."

2021-04-28 07:25:14,stocks,100 shares at 300 is far more affordable than 100 shares at 3000. A lot of people will buy in just to sell options for weekly profits.

2021-04-28 12:40:41,stocks,Fractional shares are bad as you cannot place limit order for them. So yo do not get the best price possible for your shares.

2021-04-28 11:01:25,stocks,Except Tesla split and then rapidly ran up to nearly it's prior price because people felt that's where it should be and ignored the actual market cap.
2021-04-28 13:14:58,stocks,Really? How so? Honest question.
2021-04-28 10:36:29,stocks,It‚Äôs about  enticing new investors to invest in the company when it‚Äôs at a cheaper price per share. Most people are not willing to pay over $3000 a share. This why everyone is wishing and hoping for a split.
2021-04-28 11:24:35,stocks,If it‚Äôs a 20-1 split anyone with 5 shares gets 100 and can sell covered calls. Big deal.

2021-04-28 11:09:29,stocks,"People just get hyped over it for no reason, I mean for the Tesla stock split the stock just shot up even though it has 0 effect on anything except for the price. People are just hoping for it to jump a lot."
2021-04-28 11:18:14,stocks,You can sell more covered calls $$$$
2021-04-28 11:29:06,stocks,Easier to have 100 shares to sell calls

2021-04-28 10:59:40,stocks,"Easier to balance your position if you're not American (the rest of the world doesn't have fractional shares), possible to sell covered calls or cash-secured puts if you're not rich (or buy them)."
2021-04-28 12:09:09,stocks,"It does tend to push the price up after the split, just more people buying in."
2021-04-28 12:39:51,stocks,"Tricking the uneducated to promote a short term buying frenzy, then fuelling it with institutional investors playing the momentum.  

For a long term holder it doesn‚Äôt matter."
2021-04-28 12:55:20,stocks,"And if they ever add a dividend, then theoretically higher payment. Of course, if they did that soon, it would be likely to be all factored in. 

But if one held on (ala Apple), then the split creates potentially more dividend value as well over all.

There's a fundamental behavioral economics to all of it as well. The AAPL split had that effect."
2021-04-28 12:55:23,stocks,Typically if the company pays a dividend having more shares could mean more money from dividends if they keep the same payout. But in this instance Amazon has no dividend but the price for 1 share is higher than the average retail investor wants to put up for it. So when the split occurs the price per share is decreased which may result in more retail investors buying the stock that would not have previously. More demand to buy means the share price will go up.
2021-04-28 14:40:55,stocks,You can actually afford to write options on it too.
2021-04-28 14:50:28,stocks,"Liquidity and access to more demand to support the share price. Many large investors have rules dictating the main and max price of the stocks their policies allow them to buy. Also it facilitates inclusion in major indices, which leads to all that sweet index fund money to reduce the volatility of the shares. 

The stability of the share price also affects the cosy of hedges like credit default swaps and can help ensure management hits its share price target more easily - golden parachutes for all!"
2021-04-28 09:59:45,stocks,"30:1 would be ideal, if only because amzn would match aapl."
2021-04-28 10:25:09,stocks,Well i dint take any offense. Terms like ‚Äúquality of shareholders‚Äù is just a euphemism for poor people who haven‚Äôt been able to participate in this last stock market boom ( which is partially fueled by the free money policy). I am for anything that helps to make it easier for ppl to make money in stock market.  No gatekeeping.
2021-04-28 13:23:38,stocks,"Same.

It's historically pretty rare for people to be averse to dividends. That's the point of investing anyway (ask funds that look 30 and 40 years into the future--discounted cash flows means... cash flows).

I think if Amazon was pure play retail they would pay them but so much of their money is still from the tech side. Odd conflict."
2021-04-28 14:31:35,stocks,"Yeah, but dividends (which I support) force liquidiation of capital which have to be paid in capital gains. 15% isn't nothing. Plus there's state taxes."
2021-04-28 10:39:25,stocks,That is not true. You still receive a cash dividend even if it's automatically reinvested.
2021-04-28 11:32:13,stocks,They do it to create new things.  Like AWS. Like marketplace. Like Alexa. Like their logistics division. Etc.

It's definitely cost me a fair bit of money on AMZN because I have 10 shares but didn't want to spend the $15k to bring my holding up to 15 shares lol (it's not really problem when stocks are under $1000, but above that it can cause problems despite the fact that my portfolio is large by reddit standards)."

2021-04-28 17:46:14,stocks,"That‚Äôs what I was feeling near the end too, but it‚Äôs like... so what? The split had nothing to do with what he was saying, but he was making it out like it did. I couldn‚Äôt figure it out. I feel like a 2 second conversation in real life would have clarified what the fuck was going on."
2021-04-28 12:50:12,stocks,Fidelity and Interactive Brokers allow you to place limit orders for fractional shares.
2021-04-28 12:49:16,stocks,Wouldn‚Äôt this just amount to potentially a few cents lost? If you only own fractional shares it‚Äôs even less than that
2021-04-28 14:54:28,stocks,"You don't expose your intentions as well, which obviously is a thing since someone is throwing millions for that info. And if you're in it for anything longer than few days i don't think few cents matter much."

2021-04-28 14:27:44,stocks,"As a 250-share owner, I don't want a split. I don't NOT want one, either. I just don't think it matters. You're trading investory quality for a slight bump in liquidity. It's unclear it's helpful."
2021-04-28 08:54:34,stocks,How is ‚Äúbest‚Äù operationalized in this research? Do you have a reference?
2021-04-28 11:45:47,stocks,This goes aganist the philosophy of amazon of building value over time. I think many holding it long term would hate to see their investment rising and falling constantly over options speculation

2021-04-28 10:45:36,stocks,"However dumb it is, psychologically people don‚Äôt want to own a percentage of a share they want to own a whole share."
2021-04-28 10:50:11,stocks,"In general, yes, but you can't simply buy fractional shares of whatever you want.   Brokers hold pools of stock (of their choosing) in order to allow their clients to buy fractional interests from that pool.   The available stock varies by broker.   For example, my broker only holds SP500 stocks for clients to buy fractional interest in.   Also, you cannot transfer fractional shares between brokers, the fractional part has to be liquidated.   A split would indeed attract more investors, who either cannot afford the stock at it's current price, or who do not wish to have their fractional holding tied to a specific broker.   So yes perhaps no change from accounting perspective, but the point is not completely invalid."
2021-04-28 10:50:30,stocks,"A big enough chunk of retail doesn't give a fuck about the ""accounting perspective"", it's psychological."

BUT, one big difference is when ‚Äòpenny‚Äô stocks r long time unprofitable, as they‚Äôll use slight of hand & dilute the ‚Äòcompany‚Äô further by issuing more shares. Just to keep up the charade to continue cash flowing to ‚Äòmanagement‚Äô.

2021-04-28 11:16:26,stocks,"I hardly think I'm financially illiterate but I'm still a little turned off by high share prices. Whole numbers are just nicer.

2021-04-28 11:13:58,stocks,"I understand it quite well and I‚Äôd love for this to happen. Not because I think I‚Äôd own a bigger portion of Amazon, I doubt even the dumbest trader thinks that.

The person you replied to is right. The market doesn‚Äôt work solely on a companies financials. This would be an excellent play for the short term boost the stock is almost guaranteed to see"
2021-04-28 11:10:41,stocks,"Is that true for fractional shares? How do they work? If robinhood assigns me 0.5 shares does that mean robinhood has to own the whole share? Could I buy another 0.5 shares and then own that whole share that robinhood owns? Or would I own 0.5 of two separate shares in robinhood's possession? How would I then transfer that share if I wanted to switch brokers?

I don't trust fractional shares. But if there are no downsides then I might be more interested."

2021-04-28 19:35:20,stocks,"The thing that doesn't sit well with me is that they aren't profitable without the government subsidies.

2021-04-28 12:52:48,stocks,"Domestically, yes, but a lot of people are 'committed' to ease of access/what they know. Someone isnt going to choose or change  brokers for fractional shares, unless their top priority is owning stock in an expensive company.

Also people are idiots and dont look at market cap, and people also tend to miss stock splits and dilution when looking at graphs, so the lower the share price, probably the better chance of getting new money in."

You can keep buying more fractional shares until you have the whole. Can't do that with diamonds.

>If robinhood assigns me 0.5 shares does that mean robinhood has to own the whole share?

Yes.

>How would I then transfer that share if I wanted to switch brokers?

This requires you to liquidate the fractional part."
2021-04-28 13:23:32,stocks,lol i remember talking to my friend about a stock and he's like yea i'd buy it but the price was too high and i was explaining to him that the market cap was low compared to its competitors and he just said no because of the price of the current stock lmao didn't even look at the market cap. Shit made 0 sense. the dude also nuked his account three times over and decided to buy 800c GME weeklies for 3k a pop lmao fucking idiot
2021-04-28 17:35:16,stocks,"I HATE DILUTION, but NOT ‚Äògood splits‚Äô. The reverse splits should b outlawed!"
2021-04-28 13:04:52,stocks,fidelity is pretty reputable imo and they have it
2021-04-28 11:15:54,stocks,I clarified my question a bit more. And I don't want to liquidate to avoid taxes.
2021-04-28 13:22:48,stocks,Im dutch tho.
2021-04-28 11:17:57,stocks,"I agree that there are frictions associated with fractional shares, but it isn't comparable to your diamond analogy"
2021-04-28 11:22:00,stocks,If it isn't it's not because of the gluing analogy. Maybe it is because 0.99 carat diamonds actually have value on an open market and fractional shares only have value at the specific broker who assigned them.

Obviously i don't think Biden speaking of taxes will cause a market crash, but could have a short term downturn just like last time."

2021-04-28 16:52:14,stocks,"The AAPL spike is interesting. It isn't that much of a jump, kind of similar to the tiny bump AMD got going from 85 to 88, then it proceeded to dump today back below 84. What if AAPL does the same thing? Small bump from 133 to 137 in AH only to dip back below 133 tomorrow?

FB seems much more of a significant spike that can sustain itself, much more like the huge GOOG AH bump that rallied today.

**EDIT:** I am not selling. I am a long hold on APPL. Been holding 1,500 shares at $127 since August and never sold, even when it dipped to $106 at one point. Just wondering if this is going to be more like AMD or GOOG tomorrow."

I have a high affinity for information technology as well as commerce and Shopify basically sells people the ability to perform online commerce. That is right up my alley! 

This makes me see how an earnings report can lead to an overall stock price increase. It gets people's attention and when they take a proper look at what the company does, it makes them passionate about wanting to invest in them for a long horizon! I can't believe I was so ignorant to not invest in them sooner. A business model like this will only get stronger with time. Even post COVID. Not gonna total FOMO in right now but definitely gonna begin gradually building a stake in this company.

What are your thoughts on this pushing the bubble even higher? What happens when/if people start to want to move back to the cities post-pandemic and the buy pressure for houses drop?

But it's wearing off already and I remember what happened the next day in March.

Maybe that won't happen though because there was big quarterly rebalancing last month."
2021-04-28 17:32:47,stocks,the 7% raise in dividends is super juicy too!
2021-04-28 11:20:06,stocks,"It's the most annoying thing about stocks. Shit doesn't even follow the trends it established. Good news=Go up makes logical sense but a lot of people would rather sell. Oh well, discount. Lol"

2021-04-28 11:24:29,stocks,Can't believe they're down bc their earnings were within 2% of estimates vs alphabet being at 7%
2021-04-28 13:21:37,stocks,Market is up 46% in past year. Disney is up 73%. Disney has waaaay outperformed the market. It just rose too quick too soon and is consolidating.

2021-04-28 07:29:01,stocks,Pins had bad future guidance. I doubt people will be rushing to buy the dip so soon. MSFT barely dipped and is recovering already.

2021-04-28 19:43:16,stocks,Microsoft held surprisingly strong during the tech ravaging earlier in the year. They were due for an offday sooner or later. They should gap it up in no time anyway since folks are for sure gonna chomp the dip up.
2021-04-28 17:28:31,stocks,Dividend is coming up if that makes you feel better.
2021-04-28 19:41:46,stocks,"I invest in neither and opted for VTI so that I have a buffer that tracks the market while also packing in small caps many of which I couldn't dream of being able to confidently do DD and invest in individually. Whever small caps surge/resurge, VTI catches that action and it really helped keep my portfolio afloat during the savage tech beatdown at the start of the year. 

I use FAANG level stocks to help me outdo the market and VTI to give me a safety cushion during wonky times."
2021-04-28 05:41:34,stocks,Just the usual dump after profits. Thinking it's a good opp to buy in.

2021-04-28 15:22:21,stocks,"Seems like an odd bet. This run up was driven by split rumors. However, if the stock splits it won't get near $5000 for years. 

Do options take this into account? Do they maintain the cost basis you bought in at pre-split? I don't really understand them to be honest."

2021-04-28 11:40:45,stocks,Welcome to AMD the past 6 months.
2021-04-28 10:53:00,stocks,It already ran up from $80 to $89 in a week. Likely lots of profit taking at $89 as this run is not sustainable.
2021-04-28 12:32:07,stocks,I bought a put yesterday and was was annoyed when it spiked after hours. Stocks are a gamble with earnings.
2021-04-28 09:35:56,stocks,"For sure, easily worth $300+"
2021-04-28 09:53:37,stocks,"Biden really does hate this country.  His plan to remove the incentive to long term investing over short term will really hurt R&D.  43.4%, WTF?"
2021-04-28 12:05:27,stocks,This is an overreaction. It will be back to $90+ soon. Don‚Äôt sell unless you need your money and even then you shouldn‚Äôt have it in the market anyways.
2021-04-28 12:37:48,stocks,"If I never sell, maybe I‚Äôll be able to pass them on and my grandkids can baghold too"

2021-04-28 13:28:47,stocks,"Based on market sentiment and emotion alone, I suspect that if they do NOT announce a stock split, it will fall."

2021-04-28 19:11:25,stocks,It's gonna be okay
2021-04-28 10:15:14,stocks,It ain't even red. If you weren't there for the ride from $30 to $18 don't talk to me about dips.
2021-04-28 12:35:40,stocks,I opened a few options on Sony today. Their earnings were good and should just get better all year.
2021-04-28 10:29:03,stocks,You're buying INTC after AMD's insane quarter?
2021-04-28 11:45:24,stocks,I tried that. it dropped even lower.

2021-04-28 15:47:31,stocks,It was one of the best stocks of 2020 hard to repeat that
2021-04-28 15:50:52,stocks,"I keep looking for an entry because ""reopening"" but everytime I look I can't justify it."
2021-04-28 15:35:47,stocks,"Their valuation and growth are impressive. They obviously make money on ads, but there's a big opportunity to monetize users as ""social-commerce"" grows."
2021-04-28 15:58:14,stocks,"Have you ever used a social media platform and found that the advertisements annoyed you and detracted from the overall experience? 

Pinterest is a platform where ads are not a distraction from the experience, they are part of the experience.  

People searching for stuff on Pinterest often *want* to see advertisements for the things they are searching for.   

This makes for a better user experience and also means better ad conversion for companies purchasing ads on Pinterest.   

This concept alone should be attractive and easy to understand for any investor."
2021-04-28 16:19:51,stocks,I can explain most later
2021-04-28 16:56:39,stocks,"In general you want to diversify to guard against the unexpected. We all say casually that they will go up forever, but that of course isn't guaranteed. I could see antitrust legislation (or a serious threat of it) doing big harm to GOOG and AMZN in particular. And one risk of working in technology is that someone is always trying to come up with the next big thing, so who knows maybe one day Apple and/or Microsoft will be disrupted. 

That said, they're my two largest holdings, I just rebalanced my portfolio after losing a lot on the stock we shall not name, and it's nice to not have to worry about them."
2021-04-28 16:52:12,stocks,"Past performance is not an indication of future performance, but... that strategy could have worked in the last few years. It's dumb if tech takes a big hit, like it did in the last few months, but long term the risk is low."
2021-04-28 17:39:32,stocks,"Risk of chip or factory wipeouts in natural disaster, regulations, etc. You don't want all your eggs in one basket so black swan events don't wipe you out."
2021-04-28 16:49:39,stocks,"Since SPY is an index, you won‚Äôt run into the issue of a few big tech companies plateauing for a while"
2021-04-28 16:51:42,stocks,"Because as earlier this year showed us, they aren't going to excel all the time even if they'll do well long term. If either hits a big dry spell, it can really help your bottomline in that period to have other positions to offset their losses. 

Having other stocks or a considerable ETF position gives you a nice buffer whenever stocks start underperforming the general market. During the early spring tech correction, my VTI helped keep my bottomline from getting battered too hard whenever one of individual tech stocks floundered. Stocks like MSFT and APPL will help ya beat the market but it definitely doesn't hurt to have to have failsafe to back them up."
2021-04-28 17:19:06,stocks,"because some ppl had same idea as you in the 1990 -2010 stocks and not all kept going up. i personally like a strong foundation of all world tracker  to be set for 20+ year dca and have that be ready for retirement and rest go in different etfs or stocks.


 you can go in tech and many other etfs since they dominate and always in top 5 of many etfs."
2021-04-28 18:25:46,stocks,I think TDOC has the most growth potential for the future
2021-04-28 17:49:38,stocks,"3/4 big tech earnings have caused growth, therefore by the 1st law of math, Amazon has a 3/4 chance of going up tomorrow"
2021-04-28 18:02:50,stocks,"Who knows. But I think we might see a serious gap up in the morning

If they bang it out of the park it could shoot up to 3800. Easily. 

If things get euphoric I'd expect to hit 4200 before dropping back down a bit"
2021-04-28 07:53:28,stocks,Holding since June 2020. One of my highest conviction stocks. Just got to be patient and let them scale up. They will keep growing really fast and are heading in the right direction.
2021-04-28 08:11:41,stocks,Yup and a bit of a gamble imo

I think the market is gonna overreact when JPow speaks today like always. Maybe green day tomorrow across the board but with IV crush and theta decay I think I'm gonna just dump."

2021-04-28 07:33:55,stocks,"I'm not 100% sure, but it looks to be a scenario when a stock is moving crazily and volume is high. It then gives the person an exception to the uptick rule after a stock has dropped 10%. The exception is given if the broker thinks it wouldve been the best bid in an orderly market. I don't think you'll get the short exception unless you have a lot of money though, because it looks to require an audit"
2021-04-28 10:49:18,stocks,"The macro outlook hasn't been good for a while. They make their money from mortgage refinancing which had a boom last year due to low interest rates, and the market is predicting the boom to be temporary."

The CEO was cautious as hell with guidance, but you kinda want that I think."
2021-04-28 12:26:52,stocks,You did what I did after AMD earnings in Feb. Bought at $88 and then it proceeded to dip all the way until... it went up to $88 again for earnings this month! Only to dip again...

2021-04-28 13:03:52,stocks,"You and me both lol, just AH yesterday instead of this morning. I initially was gonna wait for a dip because it seemed obvious but then I saw all the praise their earnings got and thought ""maybe this time's different""

The Xilinx merger dilution will weigh on them until close later this year, so if you think XLNX will have bad earnings you could wait until after their May 4th release, but I personally wouldn't try timing AMD now. The opportunity there was a month or two ago IMO."
2021-04-28 10:10:27,stocks,"Watch the interview with their CEO on CNBC this morning that started at about 6:25am ESTDT this morning, and then you certainly won't.  Unless she is just a virtue signaling figurehead, I'd stay the hell away from their stocks.  They make great CPUs right now, but I would be worried about the future.

Starting May 1st, 0% import tariff & 20-25% export tariff on materials. In addition, on May 1st the rebate for exported steel will be cut from 13% to 0%. It looks like that (while stating they want to reduce their steel production for environmental reasons) they want to keep as much steel inside China as possible.

zero import tariff rate for pig iron, crude steel, recycled steel raw materials...  export tariffs for ferrosilicon, ferrochrome, high-purity pig iron and other products are appropriately increased, and the export tax rate of 25% and 20%...

and

The announcement regarding the cancellation of export tax rebates for some steel products is hereby announced as follows:
From May 1, 2021, the export tax rebate for some steel products will be cancelled. See the attachment for the specific product list. The specific execution time shall be defined by the export date indicated on the export goods declaration form.

Even given our scenario, seeing 20%+ organic raise YoY won't be a thing unless inflation is extreme. No business is going to eat that cost just to be progressive when comp is usually their largest (or one of the largest) P&L line.

2021-04-28 19:39:24,stocks,"Don't play pretend, you gave a direct quote AND also gave your ""criticism"". I speak for myself here, but I'm sick of people coming in here and saying ""ABCD is down today, THANKS Sleepy Joe"". People fell hook line and sinker for Trump's ""Anything good that happens in the market is all because of me, and anything bad that happens is someone else's fault, and also Biden is going to tank the market!"", and now all these people that fell for that are coming around and commenting that they hope Biden dies because they're down 2% that day. Makes it near impossible to have any substantive politics conversations. I think you'd find people being a lot less hostile if you were to say something along the lines of ""Biden is saying this tonight. I think that this is likely to spook investors, and I think that's the wrong move because XYZ'"". I'm sure you'd still get pushback, but I'm sure you'd get more reasonable conversation out of it. Speaking to that ""criticism"" though, will big investors like what Biden has to say? Probably not. Will their moves rock the boat and cause some wake that retail investors will get caught up in? Sure. But 1. They'll get over it. They always do. And as they get over it, so shall we 2. Stock prices aren't the only thing that matter. There is a balance that has to be struck between the markets and social problems, and I personally think that the market has done so well at the expense of social structures and has put us in a position that is completely unsustainable long term. If Biden proposes something that I feel like is a good policy but effects my stock prices? So be it. I'd rather live in a functioning society with decent money than live in a broken society with a lot of money. For a micro example, I live in Seattle. I am invested in Amazon. If the city implements new taxes on Amazon it will assuredly effect my investment. But maybe that money would go to getting some of the homeless people off the streets nearby my place."

How about this. For one, I'm not 65, so I don't even give a shit if we go red the whole year. If this is your only source of income, you have bigger problems than a radical socialist in office.

It is much more important to get back to where we used to be than to worry about the short term of the market. Republicans have drained social security, they've lowered taxes to historic lows during booming economies to deplete our revenue, and if they had their way, they would have had the federal interest rates to 0% before the pandemic (I trust you've been following long enough to know about Trump's bs here). If we had 0% federal rates before the pandemic, we would be in negative rates right now and your little poopy portfolio would never matter again. Look up Germany. That's what global conservatism wants to do to America.

Yes, we need to get this shit back in control. US market won't matter if the Republican boomers get their way much longer. They went for one last bull run at the expense of our generations, and we're lucky to be hanging on right now."

2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"Why would a broker be unable to return assets in the event of insolvency? My broker is merging with another and the following from the merger information doc caught my eye:

> We would like to inform you that after the merger your assets will remain safe in the
event of a flatexDEGIRO Bank AG insolvency, as they will continue to be segregated in a separate
entity. Additionally, you have been protected against DeGiro B.V.‚Äôs insolvency under the Dutch
Investor Compensation Scheme. This additional protection under the Dutch Investor Compensation
Scheme will cease after the merger and be replaced by protection under the German Investor
Compensation Scheme that covers up to 90% of your assets (with a maximum of EUR 20,000) in
the unlikely event that the segregated assets cannot be returned to you.

My portfolio is many times that ‚Ç¨20,000 max and I would like to understand what circumstances could lead to an event where I would not be able to recover my assets? I thought the reason for segregating assets into a separate entity is so in the event of insolvency the assets would be safe? Are there times where this is not the case?"
2021-04-28 04:52:23,stocks,"For example in case of fraud: where you have bought stocks valued for 100k, but company sold them without your consent, bought yachts and trips to mars. You own nothing but numbers in database. protection kicks in, but you will get only 20k, not whole 100k. that 100k doesnt exist at the moment. 

You want to have also strong regulator who will acknowledge this and stop it, before all money are drained."
2021-04-28 10:29:25,stocks,"As the top post here says, fraud is the most obvious example - if your broker did a Bernie Madoff and didn‚Äôt buy any actual shares but just showed you virtual numbers on the screen.

Another example would be if you deposited cash in your brokerage account to buy shares - your broker is legally supposed to put that money in a separate client account which ringfences it from bankruptcy - but if they failed to do that and co-mingled your funds with their normal operational account, then in a bankruptcy case you would just be an unsecured creditor (so likely to get nothing).

In both cases of course you would legally be owed money - the problem though is who will pay it? In both instances above your broker is either bankrupt and has no remaining assets and/or has fled to South America, so you can sue him all you want but you can‚Äôt get blood from a stone.

Hence most governments have guarantees up to a certain level - obviously not in relation to investment performance, but against fraud or financial collapse of the brokerage basically."
2021-04-28 07:19:32,stocks,"For the 20k thing, it is just an extra. They are saying the investor protection scheme will be switched from Dutch to German (I assume different max values and criteria) on the merger.

However the core protection, which is having the stocks etc in a separate custodian entity that is not liable for broker bankrupcy, still remains.

Think of these as separate assurances. The 20k is only for the compensation scheme the governmental jurisdiction determines.
As for the custodian entity failing, in theory it can not barring some major fail on regulator/financial law coupled with some fraud.
So the 20k thing should be redundant and would never be used as custodian would set up transfering your portfolio somewhere else if broker stops operating."
2021-04-28 07:26:42,stocks,"this 20k max is extra on top of eu regulation for asset protection whic is 100k in cash for normal banking accounts and some number I forgot thats much mch higher for equity.

if I was you and my portfolio was as bis as you say it is I would be much more worried about their negative return rates for cash thats in your account. 

so better be 100% invested all the time.

2021-04-28 09:18:34,stocks,"While it was under dutch regulation (AFM) the same 20.000 applied, so nothing changed about the max compensation. 

Your assets should (in theory) always be safe as they are held at a third party and thus if degiro were to go bankrupt you'd be able to transfer all your assets to a different broker. (look up ""degiro - vermogenscheiding"").

I say ""in theory"" because degiro had been under investigation by AFM a few years ago for not properly separating customer's assets with their own. They have since put measures in place to prevent this from happening in the future and since nothing has been heard from it since it can be pretty safe to assume everything is okay now."

If they said ¬£20k protection on cash deposited with the broker I'd understand that, but these are assets I legally own. I'm not giving Degiro permission to lend my assets so I don't really understand how an event at Degiro could mean losing my ownership of a company tbh.

Surely Degiro can't take something they don't own and surely there is a registry other than at Degiro proving my ownership? This is what I don't understand. Perhaps share ownership is the responsibility of the broker, although I would have though it would be better for ownership of a company to be recorded either with the company itself or with a government regulator, that way assets would be safe regardless of what happens with your broker."
2021-04-28 06:08:09,stocks,"It can.

I personally keep portion of my portfolio within local stocks as those are recorded within our regulator database in my name. Broker is only an agent and it's harder to loose those, although fraud/theft might still occur. Shares abroad like U.S. stocks are in my broker's account and those are at bigger risk.

It's unpleasant thought, I know, but virtually any of your possessions can be stolen and there is no 100% guarantee anywhere. Just do best, don't keep everything at once place and try to sleep well."
2021-04-28 08:21:11,stocks,"Yeah that's what I mean by in theory it can't happen (as far as anything can't happen ie war, or collapse of financial system, or a meteor hits Frankfurt). Even if FlatexDegiro management was flat out criminal and wanted to run away to a deserted island I don't think they could access and sell those stocks in the custodian for themselves from a mechanical POV without some larger conspiracy.
And even if that did happen only a catastrophic regulator failure would not notice in the same second or allow the transaction, plus I expect a bunch of prime brokers and bank would have to cooperate on the whole thing.

Just unfortunate wording on their part to include ""in the unlikely event"" but might be some kind of disclaimer they have to use also.

Justin Davis-Rice, Naked's Chief Executive Officer, stated, ""On behalf of our board and management team, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support and their approval of the proposed divestiture that we believe will unlock tremendous shareholder value in the months to come. With available cash of $270 million, a clean balance sheet with no debt and a re-invigorated management team and board of directors, I could not be more excited to execute on our business strategy to ultimately drive revenue growth with positive free cash flow. Our Frederick's of Hollywood e-commerce business continues to perform, and we are currently evaluating several synergistic acquisition targets that could position Naked as a strong player in intimate apparel. In summary, today's vote closes the chapter on the Company's underperforming brick-and-mortar business and now positions Naked for the next cycle of growth initiatives that we expect to reward shareholders in 2021 and beyond,"" concluded Davis-Rice.

2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"What's your best ""buy signal""? I've got some money in my company that I need to invest for a 4-6 year span, as it's sitting cash here in Japan, not earning anything. My questions for any who are kind enough to reply are:

a) What's your best ""no-regret"" ETF for a conservative chunk of money that won't be touched? It's not mission-critical, but the president of my company (my wife) will not be amused if I lose some of the money. I am mostly okay with putting it all in SCHD, a dividend-focused ETF that tracks SPY quite closely and might even outperform over the next few years due to having a high amount of financials. 

b) What ""buy signals"" would you personally recommend? Looking back at the YTD, every time SPY has touched its 50-day MA has been the time to buy, or touched its 100-day then started back up. Since the only thing we can really control is when we hit the buy button, give me your personal recommendations, if you have any good ones. 

(You might laugh to hear what the commission for buying stocks or ETFs is...a 1% fee! This is because we're going through a Japanese brokerage as it's a corporate account, and they basically operate like it's still 1985 because it's Japan. There are personal brokerages that are closer to what you expect in a brokerage in the U.S. but not for corporate accounts.)"

Putting it all in at once is technically 'timing' the market and no one knows when the next catastrophe or crash will happen.  Add it in over at minimum of a few months can help you spread the risk out to avoid being that unlucky person that puts it all in at the top."
2021-04-28 04:21:23,stocks,"For me best signal is when the market is taking a dip. For example COVID 19. I throw in $20,000 into brokerage account buying ETF.

But generally, I do it whenever I can spare my money. I usually do not try to time the market because I‚Äôm a long term investor. So my goal is to get in, and buy when I have money I can spend to invest."

b) The best time to buy is when the markets are constantly red and there's a lot of FUD going on.

2021-04-28 08:52:26,stocks,"My best ""buy signal"" for individual stocks is obvious misinformation in the media about a company. Tesla would be a great example, where their cars made up 0.019% of driver or passenger deaths in 2020 and are accepted by experts as some of the safest cars in the world, yet almost every time the media was specifically reporting on fatal accidents in brand X cars it was about Tesla. I personally believe this kind of stuff does have an effect on stock prices, but eventually the truth will come out and the stock will follow. It's essentially a temporary discount on the stock price."

2021-04-28 14:22:17,stocks,"When I see a quality company with so many money-making opportunities that is currently misunderstood by a lot of people.

For example, I heard so often how Tesla was just a car company when it was obvious to me as a Tesla owner that they were really a technology company and they weren't selling a car, they were selling an iPhone on wheels which gives them so many money making opportunities beyond just the number of cars that they sell. The real money is with the software, data, and overall platform ecosystem.

Another example is Roku. I'd often see people talk about how Roku is just a commodity hardware maker. They didn't see that the hardware that they make is just to get people onto their platform where they can then make the real money with advertising, data, and taking an ongoing cut from every subscription service that wants to be on their platform because they sold so many of those cheap hardware boxes.

The next one that I'm expecting to eventually profit a lot from based off of people currently misunderstanding the company is Blackberry. Anybody that thinks that Blackberry is still just an obsolete phone maker should do some research on what kind of high-growth stuff Blackberry is really involved with now."

2021-04-28 10:41:24,stocks,"I think you‚Äôre maybe only half-serious but 100% agree with this - not so much just reddit but also the wider market. As Buffett says ‚Äúbe greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy‚Äù.

Obviously it depends why a stock is being dismissed by everyone - if it‚Äôs a cr*ppy company then probably steer clear. But the market often overreacts, I guess mainly because market forces are subject to investor psychology as much as economics.

I can‚Äôt remember the company but I read one of Michael Burry‚Äôs early breaks was a big company where the CEO and CFO got indicted and convicted of fraud. The company‚Äôs stock was in the toilet in reaction - but Burry thought it was a massive overreaction, as the CEO/CFO were indicted for personal fraud (expenses etc) rather than some Enron-style stuff. The company itself was a powerhouse and as soon as they got a new CEO they would go back to normal.
But even though everyone should‚Äôve known that, instead there was groupthink mentality that ‚ÄúCEO is a fraud, the whole company is worthless‚Äù which made no sense.

I mean last March was another perfect example - obviously without Powell things wouldn‚Äôt have recovered so quickly, but equally unless you thought this was the end of the world, surely you should be buying rather than selling. But everyone was acting as if this was the final apocalypse"

That diversification benefit has more value to me."

My philosophy is ‚Äútime in the market always beats timing the market‚Äù (actually think that might be Buffett again). I guess as long as you‚Äôre willing to hold through any dips/mini-crashes then you should be fine - although I guess it all depends if you think you‚Äôll need the cash over the next 1-2yrs (ie if you wouldn‚Äôt be willing to push your house purchase back 1-2yrs in the event of a mini-crash, maybe think about taking out a chunk you need for a deposit.

Jokes aside, KO is a dividend play, it has little to no growth to expected, and honestly they might even begin heading downwards in the coming decade imo, because you're right, sodas as popular as they are they're primed for a hit due to health consciousness. Although to be fair they do sell some non soda beverages, it's still the bulk of their business. I think there's infinitely better companies to invest in, even at todays valuations."

Although the current price is $53.53 and their 1Y target Est. is $59.36 (fairly close) I think as we continue to emerge out of COVID-19 safety protocols I would expect their revenue to jump up as more people are expected to fill in social events which typically serve these types of products.

Coke and Pepsi are the de facto two brands, and both are experiencing declining soft drink revenue, and have been for several years now.

The second largest beverage category is coffee, which coke and Pepsi have no real hopes of impacting significantly without huge shifts in company goals and investing.

I'm going to keep using W.S for trading Canadian stocks, I'm just being slammed by the 1.5% conversation fee every time I buy and sell an American stock

ü¶ç üöÄ"
2021-04-28 00:55:53,stocks,Why the move? Just curious!
2021-04-28 00:56:56,stocks,Hmm... are you transferring actual equity holdings or just cash?
2021-04-28 01:06:45,stocks,They say it takes 20 days but expect it to complete in 5 business days unless your move is complicated e.g Partial . The transfer uses an automated system so turnaround time is quick.
2021-04-28 01:10:23,stocks,Mine took about 5 days or so..not very long.
2021-04-28 02:34:10,stocks,"Took me 1.5 week to transfer out of WST to IBKR.

Keep in mind that the whole WST account will freeze during the move if it's a partial transfer, I learned that the hard way when I was seeing a lot of price volatility and unable to sell other shares on my account"
2021-04-28 01:06:01,stocks,I'm getting slammed with the 1.5% buy and sell conversion fee for American stocks at WS
2021-04-28 01:08:11,stocks,Because wealthsimple is for people who want to pay  ridiculous exchange fees if buying non CA stock and have basic needs. You can‚Äôt daytrade on WS as well.
2021-04-28 01:04:48,stocks,I'm transfering holdings
2021-04-28 08:29:33,stocks,"Well, get ready to pay $10+/option trade, and the same conversion fee but for it to just be hidden in the UI. You'll need Norbert gambit if you want to actually save. 

Questrade is a fucking ripoff unless your strategy is to only buy and hold ETFs. I'm switching to IBKR soon"
2021-04-28 03:23:53,stocks,Keep the canadian stocks there and go with IBKR. Questrade's fee is insane if you arent a ETF buy and holder
2021-04-28 11:31:00,stocks,"Why cant you day trade? I agree the USD fees can be astronomical depending on what you‚Äôre buying and how much, but i dont see how someone would have an issue day trading on WS"
2021-04-28 02:05:27,stocks,What does questeade charge ?
2021-04-28 11:29:18,stocks,"Questrades fees are capped at $10 though, wealthsimple is just a hard percentage that can cost you much much more than $10

Plus you can keep USD in USD after trading in it. Wealthsimple auto reverts it back to CAD after each trade forcing you into an extra conversion that you wouldnt have on QT

its so much cheaper to trade USD on QT than it is on wealthsimple. Like hundreds of dollars in fees to even thousands cheaper"
2021-04-28 09:53:36,stocks,"The conversion is a ton cheaper on QT.. are you ok?

It‚Äôs roughly 1.29x CDN to usd. 

But better off just doing norberts gambit ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2021-04-28 06:49:32,stocks,Do you mean to say that QT is okay for long-term ETF investors?
2021-04-28 12:23:29,stocks,"‚ÄúDay trading is not generally encouraged on the Trade platform, however, it is possible. Assets are immediately available to sell after being purchased, and when an asset is sold, the proceeds are available to use towards a new purchase right away‚Äù

2021-04-28 12:26:23,stocks,"So, its entirely possible to day trade on wealthsimple.

Your original comment says ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt day trade on WS‚Äù

This comment explicitly says ‚Äúits not encouraged, but its possible‚Äù

I agree its definitely not a *good* trading platform to day trade on, but you can absolutely still do it (or try to at least, personally im convinced *nobody* can successfully day trade unless they rely on luck)"
2021-04-28 18:49:54,stocks,"I did and they blocked my account so I moved. In conclusion you can‚Äôt. Who wants to day-trade and pay those exchange fees anyways unless you want to trade Canadian boring market. 
Be weary of so called commission-free trading, no one does anything for free, not corporate!"
2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"What causes 30 year US Treasury yield to rise? I researched on the web and it seems bond yields fall if their prices rise and vice versa. It makes total sense to me.

Now what is causing 30 year US treasury yield to rise? 

https://www.google.com/finance/quote/TYX:INDEXCBOE

Is it because 30 years US treasury bills are issued at lower price? Does that mean only Federal Reserve's actions affect the bond yields?"
2021-04-28 00:18:02,stocks,"Bonds prices are determined by supply/demand; just like the price of a stock. There is an inverse relationship between bond prices and bond yields. As bond prices increase, bond yields decrease and vice-versa. 

If bond yields increase, as it has been occuring recently, it is because people are selling Treasury bonds; thus decreasing their price. The reason as to why this is happening is basically anybody's guess but it is fair to assume that it could be due to inflation expectations (bond-holders are demanding a higher yield and flocking elsewhere looking for it) or as things start reopening, investors feel more comfortable going back to more risky investments.

The Federal Reserve does not buy long-term Treasury bonds so their actions have no effect on those. Long-term bond yields are exclusively determined by buyers and sellers."
2021-04-28 00:35:37,stocks,"Basically driven by expectation/prediction of short term interest rates rising in the future.

Short term interest rates are driven by Fed policy which are driven by economy and inflation expectations."
2021-04-28 02:06:39,stocks,"You kinda answered your own question, but also that bonds yields generally go up in a booming economy due investors exiting out of safer bonds and investing more into equities."
2021-04-28 00:28:12,stocks,"Very helpful info. Thank you.

What kind of bonds does Federal Reserve buy/sell?"
2021-04-28 00:34:56,stocks,Where are they going to get higher yields? All I can see is them selling and putting it into stocks/etfs like the S&P 500 causing the market to stabilize from the bond sell off. I don't get it ü§∑
2021-04-28 00:37:47,stocks,"Federal Reserve mostly buys short-term Treasury bonds (bonds with maturities less than 5 years) and T-bills (bonds with maturities less than 1 year). They mostly stick to short-term bonds because they are trying to anchor short-term interest rates and leave long-term interest rates to the market to decide.

[Here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/h41.htm) you can see their latest weekly balance sheet. Table 2 contains the breakdown by maturity dates. You would see that they do hold a few Treasury bonds with maturities longer than 10 years but those were mostly bought in early 2010s. Most of their weekly purchases was for bonds with maturities less than 15 days."
2021-04-28 00:47:42,stocks,">Where are they going to get higher yields? 

Equities and Emerging Markets dollar-denominated bonds. Alternatively, they could also use it to pay down debts or invest it. The FAANG entities are large buyers of US bonds."
2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"averaging up try it average down says the typical reddit investor. I read it all the time here, but no one ever say I'm gonna buy and average up. I mean it's a proven method and easier when the stock is going up because the herd are expecting the stock to go higher. 

Do what pros do, don't do what amateurs do. Try it, you'll see and you'd sleep better."
2021-04-27 23:30:44,stocks,"Dammit, I‚Äôve been averaging sideways."
2021-04-27 23:39:31,stocks,"And sell low. 




But for real.   If I have 100 stock of üçé at $45 and I'm still bullish about the company valuation.   Why not buy more"
2021-04-27 23:40:05,stocks,I'm too below average to even try averaging.
2021-04-28 01:23:31,stocks,Honestly I stopped averaging.    I just count shares.
2021-04-28 00:47:04,stocks,"I averaged both up and down on AMD. Bought in at @79, it run hard to high 90s in a couple weeks. Bought more. Then it dropped to original entry price and I bought again. Best of both worlds. The ultimate strategy."
2021-04-27 23:29:33,stocks,I think your on to something.
2021-04-28 00:12:34,stocks,Jfc of course ur supposed to average up is this for real
2021-04-28 04:59:25,stocks,"""Average up"" and ""average down"" isn't good advice without context.

If a stock is trading at $100 and moves up to $110 but you believe the company to still have an attractive valuation you should buy regardless of recent price moves. So in that context, yeah, averaging up is fine.

I average up a lot, but rarely on stocks that have had a large run up because normally I won't see as much value in a stock that has say doubled in the last 6 months. I see noobies doing this all the time though. They put some money in a stock like GME then when the price rockets up they get excited and start putting even more money into it averaging up their cost basis and making them extremely vulnerable to the eventual pull back."
2021-04-28 02:11:30,stocks,I‚Äôve been averaging down only but it only seems to be driving everything down further
2021-04-28 07:44:21,stocks,Winners keep on winning
2021-04-28 08:59:00,stocks,"This is really good advice. Everyone always talks about it being ‚Äútoo late ‚Äúto get in. If you have an investment mindset, you‚Äôre always going to be putting more money into the stock market when you earn more money through your job. It makes sense that you would put money in the stock that is growing as opposed to one that is falling."
2021-04-28 10:08:59,stocks,"The problem with people averaging down is it usually takes a long time to recover and start seeing gains. By the time they start seeing gains again they might sell out because they‚Äôve lost faith in the stock. All they have seen is it go down. Then they sell once they get back into the green, not waiting for the real returns to come. Others are buying up and enjoy a ride up so they become more happy with it so they stick with it and hang on for the big gains that the averaging down person was originally expecting. It‚Äôs all a mental game. That‚Äôs why you need to write down what your plan is when you buy a stock. Always refer back to that reason and make sure it still applies."
2021-04-28 11:46:02,stocks,"What you are describing is basically momentum factor investing.

It can be argued that momentum trades have a higher risk which explains their return. Stocks that are doing well are likely to continue to perform well, but the problem is if the company doesn't meet expectations, the losses can be much greater than a stock with less volatility."
2021-04-28 15:02:49,stocks,"I believe it usually falls under the idiom of ""time in the market is better than timing the market"", implying that even if it's up from where it was before, keep investing."
2021-04-27 23:48:23,stocks,You can sell cash secured puts to strategically average up
2021-04-28 06:31:58,stocks,"I don't mind buying high if it means I'll eventually get to sell higher. 

Raising your cost basis can pay off big time if the company surges even more after ya do it. Averaged up on my Google position just in time for them to surge through the stratosphere with their earnings. There are just those stocks that will rise too much for too long for you to just constantly wait for a big price dip. 

But like all things context is key. This advice mainly holds for strong companies you believe will just grow and grow comfortably over a long haul. If you got a speculative position at a great entry position and it then surges up absurdly in a short period of time, averaging up is usually a bad idea because there's a good chance a lot of folks will take profit and potential make your expensive shares lose you money. Scout out entry points for stocks that you're comfortable with and constantly build up on your long term winning plays while averaging down on your plays that you believe in but are currently on cooldown."
2021-04-27 23:34:23,stocks,I hate averaging up. I would rather sell and secure profits and then try to get in cheaper if I still believe it will go up.
2021-04-28 03:27:30,stocks,"Averaging up is a pretty good idea.  I found about it in Reminiscences of a Stock Operator which was based on Jesse Livermore, one of the pioneers of technical trading.  It is easy to commit more money as you are already in profits,  but it is psychologically hard for most retail investors/traders as their capital is limited and Fear Of Losing Out sets in."
2021-04-28 04:10:02,stocks,"So you're saying I need to be buying low and selling high?

Edit: sarcasm aside, cost averaging is ignoring short term price trend and just buying in. This ""pro tip"" of buying on an uptrend too... is scary that it even needs to be said or that people haven't understood this before throwing money in."
2021-04-28 02:30:32,stocks,Did you not see dfv? He averaged up
2021-04-28 07:55:18,stocks,If you think the stock is still undervalued then ofc.
2021-04-28 08:25:46,stocks,I plan on averaging up on Microsoft today. That little -4% creates a great buying opportunity. Holding XX shares @$112
2021-04-28 09:44:24,stocks,"Why not both? 

DCA on the downswing if you can't lump sum the initial position (or it's volatile and you're unsure of the bottom like VIAC), then add more if your thesis starts proving itself."
2021-04-28 09:45:59,stocks,I average from the middle out! Because that‚Äôs what an average is
2021-04-28 10:31:39,stocks,"You mean pyramiding? 

Yes, that is advised by investors such as William O'Neil, but generally IIRC he recommends taking a smaller second position (\~50%  or so) ."
2021-04-28 12:43:40,stocks,"I was thinking about averaging up on the Pinterest today, my cost basis on them right now is somewhere around 20$ :p"
2021-04-28 15:05:36,stocks,I have averaged up in some stocks which I believe in. It's a great feeling and a bullish indicator if you really believe in the stock.
2021-04-28 16:08:46,stocks,"I usually average up with VTI. I don't buy more unless its 5% up from my previous purchase. 

Basically, I don't want to buy a lot when the market is trading side ways."
2021-04-28 18:08:37,stocks,Average up as in buy the dip or DCA.
2021-04-28 03:53:57,stocks,"Ahh instead of feeling unlucky that I manage to time the peaks I should call it averaging up to sound professional. Got it, thanks!"
2021-04-28 05:15:30,stocks,"If I had an award I'd give you one. That's the funniest post I've seen in a long time. Cheers!

EDIT: I found a free one. There ya go."
2021-04-28 05:16:44,stocks,"You should average up if you think a company's fair value is still greater than the current price, but in today's market where everything is overvalued by traditional metrics and still going up, it's harder to assign a fair value. That's why people are a bit sheepish on averaging up, I feel, while they are a bit more confident adding money at a lower price."
2021-04-27 23:59:31,stocks,"sell at the lows is one of those things that amateurs and retail tends to do too. 

apple is a great example of buying high to sell higher or just own it, the opposite of it? GE I mean for over two decades amateurs just kept buying and buying as the stock trended lower and lower, averaging down on a stock like that is a mis opportunity to own stocks that went higher and higher."
2021-04-28 01:06:17,stocks,"Why would you not buy more in the first place? Whatever your reason is there, that's your reason now.

Averaging down is good because a stock becomes a better target as its price drops (higher growth to reach your price target). Averaging up only makes sense if your initial investment was too small due to failing to find funds or something."
2021-04-28 06:35:28,stocks,"Basically averaging up is wiser, the longer you envision solid and consistent growth with company. And even then if that company gets big runup it's wise to wait and see where their price stabilizes before you continue building the position up. And there's some price explosions which just aren't sustainable so increasing your cost basis at those ludicrous heights is just gonna hurt you. 

Averaging up on Google or Amazon as they rise gradually is a great idea. Averaging up on a penny stock after it just popped 450% is an awful idea."
2021-04-28 08:53:54,stocks,"Dude why do you even write so much when it‚Äôs so simple? Just average dude

Do you even average bro?"
2021-04-28 08:54:37,stocks,This is actually what I think the best strategy
2021-04-27 23:38:41,stocks,üôÑ
2021-04-28 07:50:09,stocks,The massive spikes in pricing for apple for example make it very hard for me to resist selling off my positions for quick gains because of the volatility.
2021-04-28 09:36:35,stocks,Tbf hedgefunds do buy high sell low too. But their goals are different from ours
2021-04-28 02:45:28,stocks,"Do you only trade with a set amount of funds or something?  I add to my brokerage every month, and allocate by percentage for most of my portfolio (indexes, growth, tech). Like VOO, MSFT, or AAPL.  I don't care what they're trading at, I buy.  


 The rest is value, and I just buy whatever is red or trending least green, no set percentages for those individually, just as a whole."
2021-04-28 02:00:03,stocks,Or because of strategy. Or because new funds are available.
2021-04-28 11:10:24,stocks,"Yeah, I don't put more money into the market (broke college student rn). But that's what I was saying--it only makes sense to average up if you are putting more money in, and then it's not so much averaging up as putting your new money to use."
2021-04-28 04:42:51,stocks,"I agree,  slow moving stocks and index funds this is what I do but I buy dips for the high growth volatile stocks keep cash in hand to buy during a correction like just happened it‚Äôs working for me"
2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,BETZ vs DKNG I have about 10k to invest and looking to add to my portfolio but I‚Äôm conflicted between the two. I was initially going to invest in both but I know BETZ has DKNG so there would be overlap. Just looking for opinions.
2021-04-28 00:12:07,stocks,BETZ contains not even 5% DKNG I wouldn't call that much overlap although it does have a 0.75% expense ratio
2021-04-28 08:33:31,stocks,"BETZ is obviously safer. DKNG has been making a ton of big moves in the last 6 minths inking deals with the NFL, UFC and a few others. but the stock hasnt had much gains after that news.  


Im personally in on BETZ because I have faith that the gambling sector will continue to grow and Id rather not stress about which company is going to take the largest market share."
2021-04-27 22:50:29,stocks,easy pick - buy the one with the moat and that's DKNG
2021-04-28 11:45:04,stocks,"Why not both? Go mostly in on BETZ and buy some additional DKNG. You've just created a BETZ etf with a higher DKNG weighting, which is what most ding BETZ for. That's what I did"
2021-04-28 07:21:53,stocks,"DKNG, unless you want your bet to be on the entire iGaming and sports betting industry altogether."
2021-04-27 22:50:16,stocks,"BETZ gives broader exposure, DKNG has more upside"
2021-04-27 23:07:06,stocks,Betz isn‚Äôt bad considering the upside DKNG had it could pull BETZ up in a Safeway
2021-04-28 09:12:26,stocks,BETZ + PENN are my two positions in the space
2021-04-27 22:57:27,stocks,BETZ less risk and less volatile.
2021-04-28 07:07:56,stocks,"I really like BETZ, in case DKNG don't win much share of the futur sport betting market."
2021-04-28 07:37:02,stocks,If you don't want to go all in on DKNG then do half DKNG and half BYD - I have a large position in both DKNG and BETZ and will be starting a position with BYD when it shifts closer to my bottom channel.

2021-04-28 09:22:44,stocks,"DKNG valuation is already very high compared with peers. I believe it deserves some premium for being the largest sports betting by far, but it‚Äôs trading at least 3x higher on a price to sales basis than all of its peers, many of which are growing at a similar rate."

It's bigger than Target, Goldman Sachs, BP, and HP combined at a value of over 1/3 of a trillion USD. I suppose they're doing good business but that good?

Retail chain is part of it. HD and Lowe's also do rentals, and remember that many many contractors go to HD/Lowe's to get their supplies. Basically everything home improvement. Paint. Lumber. Equipment. Yard.


I think that's the difference between other retail and them. Somewhere like Target is...optional. Outside of grocery, a lot of retail is not a necessity. HD/Lowe's are pretty significantly a business-to-business supplier. 


And from a distance [looking at their financials](https://imgur.com/a/RMFpE9P), their reports are incredibly consistent. Reliable revenue and income. It seems like investors don't care about the negative equity. The P/E and P/R are both reasonable. So that's how it ends up at a huge market cap."

2021-04-28 13:47:48,stocks,"Home Depot's business is one that just cannot be hurt by online retailing. Even if Amazon attempted to directly match the inventory Home Depot had it would be such a costly investment because of the sheer quantity of unique items that Home Depot holds and offers. Like you ever walk down any aisle of Home Depot and there's probably one thousand unique items just hanging out there, how the hell is Amazon supposed to make their consumers aware of that product? Like how the hell is Amazon supposed to have every nut and bolt and then expect consumers to know which one they need? Home Depot has a way in which if a consumer buys the wrong product they have a very low amount of effort required to get the right product. If you buy the wrong product for the job on Amazon you literally have to wait 2-3 days to be able to pick right back up.

Plus so many professionals rely on Home Depot to be their source of goods for the services they provide. Honestly I'm getting more and more convinced that in the long run the business of home repair and the traditional blue collar type work is going to slowly and surely become more valued and lucrative as less people get into it and the source of labor becomes more and more scarce."

For all those thinking about selling their homes based on skyrocketing value... remember you have to buy back into that same market.

YTD, FTEC isn't even top-100.  Last 52 weeks...not even top 100.

YTD FTEC is beating ARKW, but that's mainly due to the huge hit ARKW has taken since  Feb.  Feb 2020-Feb 2021, ARKW was outperforming FTEC by 140 points.

YTD, weed ETFs are still the best performers (as a group...not counting BDRY and BLOK) followed by oil/gas/energy and small cap value ETFs.

2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"REITS Questions I'm starting to learn about them and their potential for greater returns and dividends than the normal index funds that people invest in long term. So far I've found out that they are essentially stocks on property that is owned and 90% of the profit the stock makes returns to investors which is why the dividends are higher.

1. Any other important things I missed about them that you'd like to share with the community?

2. Anybody have a few favorites and why they like them?

3. Lastly, who here has invested in one or more over the course of at least a few years and what kind of returns have you made as far as growth and dividends?

Thanks!"

Technically, propaganda the asset class likes to propagate (90% of their cash flow has to be redistributed to shareholders) is a big fat lie.

The real number is closer to 67% and even that assumes that cash flow is maximized.  Go read the REIT rules to understand why.

Also, you should almost never invest in non-traded REITs.  Go read Wall Street Potholes to understand why."

They're certainly a bit overvalued, but the PEG ratio is very low, which is why I think that their current valuation is a very fair one.

2021-04-28 03:06:50,stocks,"Here's a quick calculation for 5 years out. 

.89√ó1.32^5 √ó .915^5 √ó 64 = 146.40

.89 eps, assume a growth rate of 32% per year (latest annual income growth rate) times an 8.5 discount with a pe ratio twice the growth rate at 64

And that assumes the earnings will grow at 32 percent per year. 

Sure, they beat analyst expectations but what were analysts expecting? Q1 last year had .50 eps. 2021 Q1 has .51 eps. That's not on track for 32% growth.

Here's 10 years with 32% growth for 5 years followed by 5 years of 10% geowth


.89√ó1.32^5 √ó 1.1^5 √ó .915^10 √ó 64 = 151.22

If you expect a 15 % return instead of 8.5 

.89√ó1.32^5 √ó 1.1^5 √ó .85^10 √ó 64 √ó .7 = 50

I'm long in MSFT and PINS among a few others. Is it normal to see such a drop after hours on the day of an earnings report.

My question is: I'm about to add Costco to my portfolio. I have a couple shares now but am adding a dozen more or so in the near future. Should I wait until their ER on May 27th or could it really go either way. Thanks."

2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"UWMC A Fundamental Analysis of why this stock is deeply undervalued - The Latest in a Series Hey /r Stocks. Admittedly, i usually post this elsewhere, and my series of Due Diligence on this stock is posted elsewhere, but I thought that you guys could actually value this stock on deep value metrics. Please be aware this DD is a day old, and the stock has now been up for the last 5 trading days.

Greetings and salutations. I wrote my last DD on UWMC 2 weeks ago, and it was the latest of a series. With Earnings announced, and the recent runup from its lows, I thought an update was in order as there's a lot of new information to parse through.

First, a status update on the stock price movement itself. After my last due diligence, the stock continued a downward trend down to 7.18 (for a 5.55% Dividend if you bought at that price point!), before it started sharply reversing course after a Barclay's Analyst initiated Coverage with a 10$ price target stating that FY 2022 EPS was roughly 6.5 Forward Earnings for 2022, and that UWMC was poised to grab more market share. This was amid a prior backdrop of positive news coverage about how undervalued the stock was, and how it was almost inexplicable (Spanning The Motley Fool, Investor Place, and SeekingAlpha) in the days prior to this analyst coverage.

The Stock has been positive the last 4 trading days, and sharply so. It is up 9.49% on the week, and 13.5% from it's low point intra-week, and stands at $8.19 right now. That means it still has a dividend yield of 4.88%. With Earnings in two weeks, share-price appreciation is sure to follow.

Second, I wished to speak about long term prospects for the stock. As you might know, the U.S. is around 4 Million Home's short of buyer demand, as home-builder hesitation over the last decade has led to a meaningful undersupply as Millennials age, and will continue to age into their prime home buying years over the next few years. (*WSJ, ""* U.S. Housing Market Is Nearly 4 Million Homes Short of Buyer Demand."" Furthermore, ""Home builders would need to construct between 1.1 million and 1.2 million single-family homes a year to meet long-term demand, but the start rate would need to be even higher to shrink the existing deficit, said Rob Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders."" Id. That means that homebuilders would need to build over 1.2 Million homes to even -start- to cut into the 4 million deficit of homes. However, fret not because...

That's because ""housing starts surged 19.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.739 million units last month."" which beat economist expectations of 1.61. (Reuters, U.S. housing starts near 15-year high; consumer sentiment rises moderately). This is as home prices in the U.S. soared 18% year-over-year in March 2021 to a median of $356,000, meaning that originations grew, and partially offset the slightly shrinking inventory and thus sales (Housingwire, ""Home prices soared in March amid record demand""). What further offsets this, is the increase in refinance and home purchase applications as rates have declined to below 3% for the first time in months. (Forbes, ""Mortgage Rates Hit Levels Not Seen In Months""). This has led to a refinance surge of 10%, and applications to purchase a home were 6%). This should allow brisk business in Q1 2021, and as refinance activity starts slowing further in the year, there should be more inventory allowing purchases to help make up the shortfall. Considering UWMC has a .15% advantage on rates, this should bode well for them.

While 2022 price increases for homes should be more subdued due to lower timber and associated materials cost, as well as more labor, they are still expected to rise. Furthermore, the purchase market is going to grow in 2021 from 2020, and beyond. The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) announced today at its [**Spring Conference and Expo 2021**](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3141176.t.en25.com%2Fe%2Fer%3Futm_campaign%3DMBA%2520Spring%2520Forecast%2520Release%2520-%25204-22-21%26utm_medium%3Demail%26utm_source%3DEloqua%26s%3D3141176%26lid%3D4748%26elqTrackId%3D370E3664A52473C73B49C93E9CDC87D2%26elq%3D25b31323597b436aac47d90e1427d551%26elqaid%3D1460%26elqat%3D1&data=04%7C01%7Cftaylor%40mba.org%7C7c50297093de479245f008d9059eadeb%7C867e5d11bde4499fb45e61572f9f337c%7C1%7C0%7C637547001352783149%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=tZj6grBtgKax8K8BkZcaUb3m%2F9NF4R4%2FoB5hFMipd44%3D&reserved=0) that purchase originations are on track to grow 16.4% to a new record of $1.67 trillion in 2021. The MBA forecasts volume to fall 14% this year to $3.28 trillion, which would still be the third-highest total ever. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are more optimistic with Fannie May Predicting $4 Trillion in Mortgage Originations in 2021, and Freddie Mac is predicting $3.5 Trillion in Mortgage Originations in 2021. With that said Fannie Mae recently revised upward from that 4 Trillion Number.

This is what Fannie Mae Predicted in their upward revised predictions:

""Consistent with a stronger home price growth forecast, the outlook for purchase mortgage originations has been boosted by $66 billion for 2021 and $84 billion for 2022 to $1.9 trillion each year compared to the March forecast. Refinance volume is unchanged at $2.1 trillion for this year and will decline 48 percent next year to $1.1 trillion, a $40 billion downward revision from the previous forecast. Around 42 percent of all outstanding mortgages have at least a 50-basis point incentive to refinance at current rates, which is down from nearly 70 percent at the end of 2020.¬†"" -- April 16, 2021.

Finally, I expect interest rates to stay level or even dip more as people flock to TIPS- [Investors Stay Hungry for Inflation-Protected Bonds - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-stay-hungry-for-inflation-protected-bonds-11619461270) , and as foreign investors continue to purchase Treasuries (Though I am not sure how much stronger demand will be as they've already returned).

Finally, I'm going to talk about what can be expected regarding Earnings and leading up to it:

1. MSR Asset Value will increase organically as interest rates from Feb 2 were at 1.1% roughly (WSJ 10 YR Treasury Table), and have increased to roughly 1.56%. As Interest rates go up, the value of MSR's go up and this asset is continuously adjusted each quarter as a result.
2. With a Net Income of roughly 1 Billion this quarter at minimum, and a Shareholder's Equity at 2.374B, there will be a Return on Equity of 42.1% on this quarter alone, and the ROE will easily lie between 100 and 200% for FY 2021.
3. The Annual Income Yield, and the interest on the 2025 Senior Notes and 2029 Senior Notes comes to 41.5 Million, and 81 Million Respectively. This is very, very, easily serviceable. (Class A Shares are dividend shares, where Class D stocks held by the owner are not). This is incredibly bullish, as the CEO would prefer to put the money he otherwise would have gotten back into the company to grow it. If his Class D shares were Class A shares, the Annual Dividend would be 640 Million. The Payout Ratio is still very low, but i believe their CEO would rather use the money to eat market share and grow his company rather than be issued a dividend. At least at this point in time.
4. The Senior Note Raise of 700 Million for 2029 will prove to have been a bullish indicator as you need capital to originate loans, and to secure more Mortgage Servicing Rights. The Mortgage Servicing Rights, will provide a constant stream of Cash Flow as well. The Company made over 3.38 Billion Dollars in Net Income last year, and is on pace to have a similar tally this year (Though not quite as high), because their bread and butter is purchase as opposed to refinance. Purchase's have outpaced refinance at times this year, and going forward into the second half of this year it's going to remain that way. UWMC does better in this environment, and it will be able to gain and sustain market share as a result.
5. RKT Earnings are on May 5th, and I expect a sympathy move for UWMC.
6. May 7 is when Russel Reconstitution Preliminary List comes out, and I expect UWMC will be there.
7. May 10 will be Earnings, and May 11 will be the Call with Analysts to discuss results. I think we can expect some heady things.

2021-04-27 21:22:50,stocks,"Its being going up every day since its dips and the lowest was around $7. But like someone said it before, every time I think it has bottom out, it drops another 2%.

Im at 400 @ 10.

Not sure how it will turn out but I want at least to break even.

It all depends on the second earning report. If it doesnt go up, I will wait until June/July to be included in the russel. If it does go up by then, Im dropping this stock."
2021-04-28 00:49:34,stocks,It's going up bc I sold 7.5 covered calls last week
2021-04-27 22:01:01,stocks,What will earnings look like after 2022 as demand goes down? Will they be able to even keep the dividend during down years?
2021-04-27 23:23:11,stocks,Any thought son S&p 500 inclusion? I think as long as it has a market cap above $4B and stays profitable is will be included in the S&p 500

2021-04-27 20:02:28,stocks,Not sure why you‚Äôre being downvoted. UWMC did hit its all-time low on 4/20 @ $7.18. Need to remember that this is a SPAC and anything prior to Q1 2021 only reflects Gores Holding IV.
2021-04-28 13:08:06,stocks,So if it dropped to $7 it's market cap would be about $11.2 billion. At it's current price market cap is about $13.28 billion. Even the low scenario of $11.2 billion it is higher than the market cap of the bottom 30 or S&P 500 companies. Are S&P 500 market cap inclusion requirements not simply the top 500 by market cap that meet the other S&P 500 requirements?

2021-04-27 20:09:11,stocks,"Because 2020, and 2021 are bonkers due to mortgage rates leading to a refinance boom. 2022 is more like 2019 or other years. The current p/e ratio is much, much, lower than that at current. Forecasts are 1.42 FY 2021 (Which I think is ludicrously low by Analysts, and comes in below Company Guidance in regards to Q1 numbers as well). That comes to a current P/E ratio of 5.83. So, it's undervalued by every metric."

2021-04-28 10:51:18,stocks,we hold
2021-04-27 20:12:27,stocks,What percentage of your portfolio is this company?
2021-04-27 20:32:17,stocks,"All of it lmao. I did extensive research, and at one point the stock reached 7.18 for a P/E ratio of 5.05. However, in the interest of disclosure, I started buying in the mid 8's, and averaged down to 8.04.

I'm vested in the interest of the stock, because it's a good short, medium, and long term play. The Dividend Yield alone, alongside the earnings call where their CEO stated he would increase the dividend, give a special dividend, or even do stock buybacks if there was excess cash this year means that it's well positioned for income investors with a dividend yield at it's lowest above 5.5% and currently at 4.8%, not counting a dividend raise. This, alone, would make it a T stock worthy investment, without the overburdened debt load, and with strong cash flow and market share prospects.

Medium term, it's poised for rapid share appreciation between its catalysts, and the fact it's severely undervalued, and you will get a very strong Month on Month Return. This is where I stand. If it reaches my internal Month on Month Return Number, i'll likely sell the shares or sell covered calls well in the money to eke out a bit of premium on the way out in its runup.

Long Term, the housing Market in terms of purchase will continue to grow in the next few years and briskly. Furthermore, UWMC is a market leader with 34 percent of market share, poised to dominate and take further market share as the years come since the area is extremely fragmented. Furthermore, the Wholesale Channel is growing as a whole, so that's two tailwinds. Their competitive advantages in their technology ensures that time to close, and the ease of use for brokers, will sustain that market share gain in an overall growing market.

I would not normally put my eggs in one basket, but as Warren Buffet said ""It's best to be greedy when other's are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy."" And, yes, i also know he also said to invest in a small basket of stocks, if you're not going to be in an index fund. But, again, it's such a strong company fundamentally and it's so severely underpriced and has been, that I made the decision to place my portfolio into this."
2021-04-27 20:07:40,stocks,"You are missing something... UWMC had an EPS of $2.10 prior to the quarterly dividend of $0.10 for Q4 2020. Net income for this quarter was $1.37 billion.

The latest earnings that you‚Äôre referring to is actually for Gores Holding IV (SPAC), which was a blank-check company with no operations."
2021-04-27 20:12:46,stocks,"Correct.

UWMC was a SPAC, not an IPO, which doesn‚Äôt qualify. The Russell Reconstitution takes place on May 7, three days before earnings. üòé"
2021-04-27 20:58:32,stocks,"The reason I ask was that I noticed all your posts were uwmc. You may want to consider some other companies for your own sanity.  While your waiting in a position that may be stagnant for some time,  you may be missing out on steady gains elsewhere.  Sure one day,  you may get the double on this stock,  but you may have already had missed out on larger gains slow and steady elsewhere and although a double may feel good,  it wasn't in your best financial interest.  The other reason I would suggest this is that you don't live and die each day by one company. I see you quoted buffet, and if you followed graham's value investing,  you would know that if you have to know the daily price of a stock,  there is something wrong with your portfolio.  It becomes much easier to sit patiently on a stock like this when it's a position that you don't even have to pay attention to. When I started investing,  I had the mindset of putting my money to my best idea. Then as I started adding companies, I would still keep focusing on the largest of the holdings and didn't care much what the others were doing.  I realized i shouldn't be so overweight on one,  and as I accumulated more and more companies,  it's nice when it doesn't matter what 1 or even 2-3 of my companies are doing.  I can rest easy knowing I bought at a good price,  and one day they will come to fruition. I feel that if you need to check the stock price every day,  that's a sign of trouble."

They're a great company and I've been yelling to buy for awhile now, but you cant ignore refinance shrinking and them alienating their brokers. How do you feel about that? The positive tail winds that should have carried this company fall apart when Mat forces business elsewhere. My good friend who encouraged me a lot with my large UWM position because of his experience with them as a loan officer came to an abrupt end as they got forced out because they didn't sign the addendum. Obviously he's not the only lender who had to make that shitty choice. That, plus 76% of their origination's being refinance turned me neutral. I'll maybe keep adding sub 8, but I'm not looking to build much larger of a position, but that's just me."
2021-04-27 20:22:34,stocks,"I just want to correct you there for a moment. The Preliminary List is on May 7, but the actual reconstitution (When the funds buy), is on the last week of -June-. The Stock will still go up on news of its inclusion, but the actual buying by the hedge funds will, as stated, be the last week of June."
2021-04-28 17:21:30,stocks,"Sorry Moolium, i intend to respond to you eventually, but as for you u/_Please it's because I'm basing it off 2022 and further on. This Refinance Boom was a once in a lifetime thing (Though with this new exclusive by the WSJ regarding Freddie and Fannie helping low income people with low credit scores get a refinance. Up to 2 million could qualify for that. Here's the link:  [Mortgage Refinancing Initiative to Help Lower-Income Borrowers - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mortgage-refinancing-initiative-to-help-lower-income-borrowers-11619616615)). That would further the refinance boom along further through the summer and  a little beyond. It's expected that Purchase is much stronger here, and from here on out, and that it should be for the next 4-6 years. Plus with the undersupply of homes (Near 4 Million), things are just getting started, as it will take years to rectify the long term imbalance.

To answer your question this is why i am bullish on UWMC as opposed to RKT (Other than their P/E valuation). ""This is problematic for Rocket because the company is more reliant on refinancings than purchase mortgages. Susquehanna analyst Jack Micenko said last year that while Rocket controlled 9% to 11% of the refinancing mortgage market between 2018 and 2020, its share of the purchase mortgage market was in the 2% to 3% range."" UWMC has a much stronger advantage in the purchase market than does Rocket, and while Rocket may want to get an advantage by furthering its market share in the Wholesale business, they prefer the higher margin retail side. Furthermore, they tout a 91% stickiness across all their loan vehicles, so if you buy a home through them you're 91 percent likely to get your auto loan through them. This incentives them to cut the middleman out, and i can understand why there is a lot of people who are against Rocket in that respect. After all, they don't want what Zillow did to retailers, to happen to Mortgage Brokers. Especially since UWMC expects it to grow, unless stunted by the cutting out of the middle men. UWMC is also entirely in the wholesale channel, so they don't have an incentive to fuck over Brokers.

Let me be clear, UWMC's tech is pretty much universally praised, and they let brokerages use that tech, even if their not routing their mortgages through them. Even the person who wants to file a class action lawsuit admits this (To be clear that lawsuit has almost no chance of winning on the merits), Their time to close, on their website has ticked down from 15-16, to 14 and less to prove it.

Furthermore, just today they upped their prime jumbo from 2 million to 3 million, and offer better terms. They also started allowing manufactured home originations through them.

Like, it's a very strong business, with a competitive attitude. Their CEO stated of the 4500 who did business with both Rocket and UWMC, less than 500-600 refused the addendum. It sucks for your friend, but the market is so hot right now that it shouldn't even matter. There are 73-75 other mortgage brokers other than the 3 companies (UWMC, RKT, and that other one).

It's an aggressive business move, but it's a strong one to make. If they didn't think they'd win, they wouldn't have issued it. It's really as simple as that. I'm investing in this company based on fact, not emotion. It sucks for your friend, but it's good for UWMC.

Edit: Just wanted to cite the number exactly. Here you go.

2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"An Idiot Seeking Clarity [Serious] Hi,

I don‚Äôt know if this is the right flair but I‚Äôm dying for opinions from people who are not part of the GME hype-train.

I‚Äôm in the high mid-XX of GME and am very curious what the sane people here think about all this MOASS mania?

The ten-gazillion-trillion per share numbers thrown around are absurd and exhausting. I guess, theoretically, it can go to an insane number but, theoretically, I can become starting pitcher for the Yankees in my late 40s. 

In YOUR own opinion: is $1K out of the question? Is $10K? Is $100K? 

I have NO idea because all I get is echo chamber replies to my genuine questions and, if you can‚Äôt tell, I‚Äôm a complete fucking moron."
2021-04-27 20:25:50,stocks,"I hope y‚Äôall make out like bandits, I really do, but from where I‚Äôm sitting I‚Äôm skeptical. The whole thing looks like mob mentality run rampant with the whole mix of cultish fanaticism, sharp dealing, gullible schmucks, and lunatic conspiracy theorists. 

If you throw a few bucks at it for entertainment, yeah I‚Äôm for that. I still wouldn‚Äôt touch GME with a ten foot pole, but I am in some penny stocks for fun, so I get it. But I think you have as much chance of striking it rich as you do of winning the mega millions. That money doesn‚Äôt materialize outta nowhere, it comes out of other peoples pockets into your own. Maybe the cultists are right and that money will come from hedge funds. I‚Äôd love to see it. More likely a few people who were lucky, or good, or oh so very naughty will walk away with your money. 

But maybe I‚Äôm just performing my usual knee jerk reaction against group think. I‚Äôve always been a bit contrary. Or maybe I‚Äôm an idiot and don‚Äôt understand why the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the one true god."
2021-04-28 08:45:55,stocks,Roaring kitty/DFV did an analysis on the stock long before all the hype and at that time it was $4. Within 6 months it had quadrupled and this was before the mania. So clearly the analysis was good.
2021-04-27 22:32:47,stocks,I don‚Äôt think anything higher than $300-$400 is realistic.
2021-04-28 05:14:32,stocks,"The squeeze is over but fanatics can't seem to understand that. There's a reason why GME is commonly compared with QAnon and religion -- there's a bunch of facts and they will never stop finding alternative interpretations and things like FTDs. ""Going to $500 was a gamma squeeze which isn't a squeeze"" is the worst one yet.

The most critical issue here is the assumption that everyone is manipulating the GME data to protect hedge funds, but refuse to accept that there are so many institutions behind the GME buying and in place to profit so tremendously off any squeeze that these data manipulators are better off just coming clean and joining the winning side.

The squeeze is over with SI at less than 10% of what it used to be, and the question now is where GME's headed. GME is really a gamble of how well they are going to execute their transformation; they are dirt cheap now if they become the next Valve, but there's a lot of tough work ahead to reach there. I recall some DD on GME that it's fundamentally around $169, and there's been quite a bit of good news since then, which makes its current valuation pretty much quite right where it belongs."
2021-04-27 20:57:28,stocks,"the GME gang is full of inexperienced traders to be polite. going against pros. who've been manipulating the markets for decades. they stand no chance.

also, DFV is playing them all. many with lose all of their invested money. it's not going to be pretty."
2021-04-28 06:53:52,stocks,"Good post and nice to see a different perspective for once. I hold XX shares. I've only put in what I can comfortably lose. If I lose it all tomorrow, it was worth the what if gamble and it has been a fun ride.  If it does take off and rach $400 / $500 or $1k+ a share....amazing. 

it's been something fun during lockdown and I would have spent the money on takeaways and other rubbish anyway lol.  I see some people have literally put everything they have in though and that is concerning because nobody truly knows what is going to happen."
2021-04-28 08:52:48,stocks,"None of these people have done any of the research on GME so none of them actually know what they are talking about. They are simply saying shorts have been covered, because that's what the media said, and they dont think those numbers are possible because they haven't done the extensive research into short squeezes, naked shorting, the sec, the dtcc, and the fact that the entire market is a house of cards that is so overleveraged due to their fraudulent practices that the GME short squeeze is the only thing that might actually bring attention to the manipulation and fraud that is being allowed to happen with virtually no oversight or penalties.

Read the copious amounts of DD for yourself and decide what you believe in. You are on the fence and if you don't belive then you should probably just sell now, because for the people who do believe, the people who are committed to holding their shares and not selling any until even one share holders are able to lift themselves out of poverty, you selling on the way up will slow momentum and puts the whole thing at risk. The idea of supply and demand, and that all shorts must cover when magin called, says that they must buy an estimated 5 times of the available shares, maybe more. If there are no shares to be bought, the computers scan and scan looking for shares and as long as there arent enough shares, the price goes up, possibly exponentially, and the ceiling is in theory infinite. If people refuse to sell, and shares must be bought, the price could without question raise to those numbers. 200,000 people banded together to lift themselves up out of poverty while exposing a corrupt system that preys on the working class while committing fraud to continue building obscene wealth for the less than 1%? I wouldn't bet against that. It isn't just a play, it is a movement that has given many people hope, that if successful will benefit the entire market, economy, even across the globe people are learning and believing.

No one here can tell you an answer, just like no one on the gme subs can either. The main difference is that GME has hours upon hours of peer reviewed research and dd from hundreds, even thousands of people who have done nothing except learn the stock market inside and out for months. What do the people here have? Literally nothing other than what the media has told them, and their opinions."
2021-04-28 12:12:49,stocks,"I got onboard, with a fair degree of skepticism.  But, I like to ride volatility, whether I believe the hype or not.

I wanted the hype to be real and to play a little role in the community project.  I never believed in $1K or $10K.  I even made a few grand.  But then I pumped it back in on the dip, and got underwater, hard.

My feeling is that the days of the climb potential are past.  We're all baggies to some degree.  The corpse is still twitching, though."
2021-04-28 13:53:19,stocks,"I have hopped on and off the GME train a few times.

I do not get into the hype personally but profit from it when I can.

GME is still all hype and very little substance to justify the current price.

At the point you see 50+ WSB posts on ""HODL THE LINE"" the pump is already in and those 50 people are looking for bagholders as they make a smooth exit and its easy to dump your shares, block style.

Hype fades and the stock reverts to the mean. This is true for BOTH short squeezes as well as hype-based pump n dumps and GME is a rare combination of both.

I took my profits and didn't regret it a single time.

If I HAD to take a position on GME RN, it would be short..... heavily."
2021-04-28 05:39:05,stocks,"It smells funny in here. First off, I hold a double digit position and I couldn't care less about the MOASS, the company is going up. Short version:

1. They have no debt, billions on their balance sheet and positive cash flow.
2. The stock is trading at two times sales (and that is 2020 sales, they are going up last and running quarter).
3. The company has hired lots of directors and execs that could have made a lot of money staying with their old employers. Just like everyone else they neither hate money nor reputation. They would not have signed up with a failing company, so obviously Ryan Cohen has presented them with a clear vision of what is to come.

Now to the MOASS. I have not signed up to the subs mainly because I don't want my feed spammed with the memes and stuff. I think that ""DD"" posts have increased in quality.

We know that the reported SI is likely untrue, even assuming they don't misreport to FINRA. FTDs are massive, there's unusual options activity in suspicious intervals. There have been good arguments made that retail alone owns the float. The price movement makes no sense and the Dark Pool activity is suspicious as hell.

Shorts have not covered. Their DD told them the stock was going to go back below 20 and historically they could push retail around, so they tried just that. I think the media activity is indicative of that. When in doubt, watch the video where Cramer describes how short HFs manipulate the narrative again.

Where is it going to go? I don't know, but they had to put the emergency brake on after 400$ in January. Let's just say I would certainly not consider selling in the low 1000s, as the stock can make that by itself in a few years.

Can it go up to ten million? I think in theory yes. The question is if liquidating banks or the government will let it. I say no to the first, but the government has an interest in something happening, so you never know:

1. Retail pays taxes and actually spends the money on the economy.
2. They have to keep the faith in the US stock market.
3. Biden doesn't want a bipartisan movement in the streets months after taking office."
2021-04-27 22:06:02,stocks,"I personally wouldn‚Äôt be holding GME right now. I bought during the initial squeeze at 70 and sold at 130, and I‚Äôm honestly pretty shocked that it moved back and has stayed above 100. I think if you really look at the valuation and the short interest, the current price is not that sustainable, so I‚Äôd personally be staying away/selling.

GME hitting 1k or more was only somewhat realistic during the initial squeeze, when short interest was at 130% of the float. If it didn‚Äôt happen then, it‚Äôs not happening now, since the short interest is only around 30%. 

You might get some moves up here and there on some good news or something but there isn‚Äôt really a chance that you‚Äôre gonna get the same type of returns as the original short squeeze. The only reason why the price is still sitting near 200 is because of the hundreds of thousands of people on Reddit pumping it up right now. If you want to throw money in pumped-up meme stocks, there are many better options than GME right now."
2021-04-27 20:47:00,stocks,"I agree with people here that the odd of seeing 300-400 again are awfully low. Don‚Äôt even dream of 1000$. I expect a few more months of irrational market before it settle at 50-100 and after that they have 50-80% chance to fail staying relevant in this decade.

The ape gang is not a monolithic group so for each 100$ many will fold. 
You don‚Äôt invest with a short interest thesis, ever. And if you do anyway,maybe you are a short term trader, i hope your target company has better growth prospect than gme.

Congrat to deepfuckingvalue for an awesome win but i bet he knows his last move (quadruple down) will be a small loss. The idea of that last small loss is that doing so he will keep the previous gain without prosecution."
2021-04-27 22:41:34,stocks,">In YOUR own opinion: is $1K out of the question? Is $10K? Is $100K?

Yes. Yes. Yes. I doubt it goes far over $200 ever again. It is not a profitable company, and it will inevitably fail. There are going to be a lot more bag holders than there already are when it's all over."
2021-04-27 21:03:52,stocks,"The GME thing is just delaying the bankruptcy. I am rooting for those guys because I'm a little guy too. They have such a good thing started with the way they are organized. They could do some really good things but it's just wasted. They think they put a hedge fund out of business but there were 10 more run by seasoned pros that were quietly making a fortune off it. There's one podcast I listen to, the guy is a professional trader and ran a couple trades off it just for the fun of it.

2021-04-28 03:34:46,stocks,"Not in on GME, but just as general comment you put an evaluation on GME and compare it to legit stocks that rose over years and decades to their value, that's a mistake. I don't know what the current thesis on GME is, but the idea of it reaching such numbers is based on shorts being forced to cover due to margin calls, and this would happen at similar times for many since many shorted at similar times. If that happens a snowball effect can get started and ramp up the price enormously.

That said, I'm not sure why people make up such numbers. 
A lot compare it to VW in 2008, but Porsche owned 43% of VW shares, the German government 20% and there was not a lot left. Why does this matter? Retail investors are not an entity. If you own 99% as a single person you function as 1 brain and can watch it shoot up without selling. Then you sell at the highest point. But here, people will sell way before that and that happened previously already. 

Now, since GME hit a way new overvalued level I am sure a lot of shorts that left and had to pay went back in, probably not the same, maybe the same, but it should be at a high level. But that means if these opened their positions at 350-500 AND didn't already close it when it hit 39$, which would be stupid, then it's the same situation as before but instead of starting at 20$ it's now at a way higher level. On one hand that means it's way harder to break, but shorts pay higher interest now. So if a similar or even same scenario happens, then this could probably easily reach 700-800$. But as I said, it's way harder to reach the same goal as before. When it hit 360 it was 12 times over the most shorted amount of 20$. To reach a 12 times limit right now at probably 200$ it would need to reach 3600$ per share to have the same trigger. There was a big change where you need to have the money to short something, though I am not sure if that impacted risk or volume. If it's volume, then that sucks. If it's risk, then that could mean the 12 times is instead ""only"" 6 times or even just 2 times. Which is still way higher as before but more manageable."

2021-04-28 03:46:02,stocks,">DFV did nothing wrong he can keep all he shit if wanted.  

He will keep all the shit. He will keep the millions he made out of 50k while people hype him to be some sort of god, while a majority will lose their money. That's how you make money on the stock market. To make money, someone else has to lose money. 

> STOP acting like he did anything but a ""I BELIEVE IN THE STOCK"" fucking move. 

He did a very smart move, instead of posting DD, theories etc. on his stock he just posted gains. That's the definition of ""putting money where my mouth is"" except you remove the mouth part completely. He didn't have to convince or argue, he just had to show his growing value. And even if it went down, he initially started with 50k and he was always way beyond that value. 

All it took were some people following him long enough to watch his videos and realize there could be potential if enough people join, he didn't even need to promote anything himself - which turns out to be crucial with the congress hearing.

The best part was him being challenged to double down and he did it - at 39$. That is the lowest it had been before rising up again, meaning again out of all the people in the boat, he has the by far best position. And after his contracts ran out in April, he bought them instead of closing them - but again at numbers insanely low since they were opened years before.

Say what you want, but use your brain. He can literally close out his position at any price that GME will have for a long time and still make millions of it, be done with trading and live an insanely comfortable life. That is not the case for 99% of the people that are in and lose money."

So my shares shouldn‚Äôt change the outcome at all I‚Äôd literally everyone else but me is holding right? No cuz they aren‚Äôt going to be holding they are all going to sell just like they did at 400+ they only people who didn‚Äôt take profits during that squeeze are people who bought in on the way down at too high of a price that we probably have not even seen again I don‚Äôt have to have the same exit or entrance plan as you or anyone else no one bought these shares for me or gave them to me I purchased them myself with my own funds I will do with them what I want and a bunch of reeeeeees on the internet are not going to bully me into changing my already highly doubtful exiting plan.
2021-04-28 09:27:30,stocks,"Whatever is good for you do it.

Just know that selling on the way up doesn't make any actual sense. You sell once it hits a peak, and then dips. Why would you sell at 1k, just to see it keep shooting up to 2k. Then to 3k. If it hit $1500, then dips to 1400, ok I see your plan. But selling on the way up is how you kick yourself with regret.

At 10 or 11 I earmark another 30 minutes to adjust the sails for the day and exit positions that missed the mark. At 12:45 I get back on until market closes. After work, it is time for research and DD, usually 9-1. The research produces a set of trades complete with exit criteria for each (upwards and downwards) that are executed the morning after at market open. Usually I trade options, mixing aggressive bets with theta and vega strategies. In my research I prefer to focus on fundamentals and company events rather than chart pattern cargo-culting. 
I work with separate accounts with layered risk: they both get seeded or trimmed as necessary in January to 100k. Both have grown quite a bit this year - the high-risk account is up 600% YTD, the premium-scalping account about 110%.

2021-04-28 14:28:19,stocks,I can see that. but that does not dictate the direction it will be going.
2021-04-28 09:38:36,stocks,"I guess I could, but I don't mess with selling calls and puts. I don't understand it well enough so I mainly just buy and HODL until I feel like it's time to invest in something else."
2021-04-28 11:22:19,stocks,"To be honest 105% YoY feels a bit of a slowdown. I hope it will be around \~120%. 105% is amazing in a regular year, but Q2 2020 was very weak due to covid just hitting the US/Europe with most companies cutting spending drastically."
2021-04-28 01:00:18,stocks,"Felt like they could have been less brutally honest, but either way you can' t blame the market for selling. Management was not very optimistic.

Honestly with all the hate corporations get for being opaque, I actually find that they are too transparent sometimes (read the Risk Factors section on any 10-K). Let the numbers speak for themselves and investors can do with them what they please."
2021-04-28 01:04:48,stocks," ‚ÄúStarting in mid-March, the easing of pandemic restrictions slowed U.S. MAU growth and lowered engagement year over year as people spent less time online. In Q1, we saw good retention of the MAUs we gained during 2020, but we still don‚Äôt know if or how long this retention will last.‚Äù"
2021-04-28 09:10:39,stocks,depends on your leverage xD
2021-04-28 08:28:07,stocks,Can you properly see the images if you just log in without paying?
2021-04-28 17:27:05,stocks,"I do not, and I don't like sites that make you login to view content when there is no privacy related reason to make it so."
2021-04-27 23:12:13,stocks,"69? Nice. 

I am a bot lol."
2021-04-28 08:50:14,stocks,Fair. Thanks
2021-04-28 12:13:23,stocks,"Haha poor you, lol!!! Only a 50% gain.

Good play."
2021-04-28 07:29:07,stocks,"If he thinks you have a lot of tech, I wonder what he thinks of me owning AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, FB, PINS, SQ, PYPL, ROKU, PLTR and more"
2021-04-28 13:55:46,stocks,"Most teens don't use Pinterest.  On  those apps they do use they ""are"" the product for the most part.

Big difference between them and the 18+ demographic with money to spend.

Have it on my watch list for now."
2021-04-28 10:06:57,stocks,I would just be neurotic seeing it but be 100 lol. Check out theta gang and the wheel strategy when you have the time! It suits a hodl style of investment if you do and avoid getting assigned on your calls
2021-04-28 15:20:28,stocks,Looks like we're seeing $65 today. No dip buying happening at all. Just a free fall.
2021-04-28 05:11:32,stocks,Seems like a reasonable assessment given lockdown lifting - MAU may go up or down depending on what they get out of the platform coming out of the lockdowns.
2021-04-28 09:10:21,stocks,seems like somebody that knows what he's talking about
2021-04-28 09:05:21,stocks,"You don't have to pay to use Pinterest. You just need an account to view the images, create boards etc."
2021-04-28 12:21:15,stocks,yeah but they're only a few hundred bucks so they only covered a fraction of what I'm down now. I did end up getting another 50 shares @ 67.10 right after market open
2021-04-28 14:31:25,stocks,"FB makes money on adds. Like radio, tv, and others. The rate they charge is based on people that will see it. Like a super bowl add. They can charge millions for 30 sec commercial spots. Why because millions will watch it. Now if their viewers drop 50%. Cant charge that much for add time. FB will be the same way.

They own instagram which is a huge plus. That is and will grow. FB will decline. Will be more of a wash."
2021-04-28 10:16:04,stocks,Thanks I'll do that! If I buy 5 more on this dip I'll post a screen shot for you haha
2021-04-28 15:26:43,stocks,Maybe back down to the daily 200 SMA would be a nice place to buy.
2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"""Microsoft books biggest revenue growth since 2018""... and $MSFT down 3%+ after hours. Why? Insomuch as anyone can truly explain anything, why does this happen? I'm no veteran, but in the year or so I've been doing my own trades, I've seen this several times. (Most recently with $HOME, which is just now approaching its price previous to announcing earnings at the end of March, when by all accounts it crushed estimates.) 

Anyway, I just added 3 shares for a total of 16 (avg: $233.67)."
2021-04-28 00:27:57,stocks,"Stocks 101: sell the news.  >80% of companies will be expected earnings during ERs.  To see a bump after an ER there has to be an unexpected surprise.  Usually that's a MASSIVE ER beat, moreso than the market was expecting. But most of the time a bump will come after an ER if forward guidance is revised bullishly upward more than expected.  Or if there is some sort of surprise news. 

But yeah, you'll constantly see a run up in a ticker a week or two before an ER, then around 3:30 pm or do the day before ERs are reported a dip will often happen. It's traders trying to get out before the ER because they know that sell the news will happen post ER.  If you're an actual owner of a stock and not a trader, ERs are just noise and you ignore what happens after. Continue to buy a solid blue chip like msft."
2021-04-28 01:55:02,stocks,"I think the best way to understand it is that the ""consensus"" earnings estimates were too low. The stock has continually gone up, even after those earnings estimates were put out. So in order to justify the current price, MSFT need to beat earnings MASSIVELY, but they just beat earnings decently.

Great company...the market is just saying the stock ran a bit too much. It'll keep its steady climb going though."
2021-04-28 02:39:42,stocks,MSFT goes down on earnings three times out of four. You can go back years and verify it yourself: it‚Äôs clockwork. OTM puts two days before rarely lose money. It does not matter how amazing the quarter has been: the stock usually fattens on the days before the earnings and drops 2-5% in the AH.
2021-04-28 04:41:33,stocks,"Stock price is determined simply by what buyers and sellers are willing to pay for a stock. This is only loosely related to news, especially in the short term.

Financial news stations always overplay the degree to which news determines the price of a stock on any given day. (You know why? Because they sell this news.)

But think about all the different reasons you might buy or sell a stock on a given day. Sure, sometimes it's because of news, other times it's because you need the money, you're rebalancing, you learned some additional, distantly related info that made you change your mind, you have some arbitrary stop loss number plugged in that triggers and on and on. So there is a ton of noise driving stock price any given day. 

So, it's pointless to try to figure out what caused a dip or rise of a stock in a given day. It was thousands of factors, big and small, that defy ones ability to use them to predict the next movement."
2021-04-28 08:38:35,stocks,Earnings don't affect the stock price. Buyers and sellers do. Maybe there were more sellers than buyers despite the news. There are several strategies that require you to ignore all news and focus on basic fundamentals and TA of price action. If you are trying to buy the rumor you're supposed to sell the news.... At least this is what I've been led to believe
2021-04-28 09:48:45,stocks,"Microsoft would have benefited by not reporting the same day as Alphabet, IMO.

Their results were impressive stand along but just do not look nearly as impressive in comparison to Google.

Specially bottom line."
2021-04-28 10:15:01,stocks,Fed Reserve chairman will speak today at 2:30... if he‚Äôs raising rates stocks will all drop and no one wants to bag hold
2021-04-28 10:21:25,stocks,The market is irrational.
2021-04-28 11:16:08,stocks,u/space2k Dropped 3% because there was an analyst with an even higher expectation which quarterly didn't quite meet. So high expectations begot higher expectations and self fulfilling disappointment. Artificial.
2021-04-28 16:04:29,stocks,Everything in the market right now feels like a reality TV show... buy and hold!
2021-04-28 00:55:12,stocks,Yea I was salty af about this too. I read the earnings and I was like ok this is good let‚Äôs hope the stock doesn‚Äôt do something stupid then I check it‚Äôs down 3.5%. I was like motherfucker and my 4 year old was like daddy what‚Äôs that mean. Then I had to explain it‚Äôs a bad word that daddy‚Äôs sometimes say when they get upset. Msft messed me up today man
2021-04-27 20:01:56,stocks,Did you see that 2mil volume dump at around 3 or 4?
2021-04-27 21:27:29,stocks,We are so far overvalued on every metric for 90 percent of equity‚Äôs. msft booked 40BB in profit last year and has a market cap of 2TT. It would take them 42 years to grow into that at current run rate. It is up 13 percent in the last three weeks that‚Äôs 250 billion in market cap. They need to book an exceptional quarter to justify.
2021-04-27 21:18:28,stocks,Don‚Äôt worry. Microsoft is a great stock and it will recover very very very likely.
2021-04-27 21:55:39,stocks,Might be because of its crazy run up before he earnings
2021-04-27 23:19:53,stocks,market expected them to beat - market bought the rumor and sold the news.
2021-04-28 01:35:02,stocks,"This is where all the mouth breathers chant ‚Äúsell the news, sell the news‚Äù. Yeah, it‚Äôs what happens but what a stupid fucking concept."
2021-04-27 21:58:35,stocks,"This happens every quarter with them, you get used to it. No big deal"
2021-04-27 23:09:36,stocks,Yeah the thing is you don‚Äôt get that happened it‚Äôs called ‚Äúearnings are priced in‚Äù learn about that. And maybe look up buy the rumor sell the news.
2021-04-27 23:24:45,stocks,It‚Äôs up a lot in a short amount of time
2021-04-27 23:39:35,stocks,Witchcraft.
2021-04-28 00:01:16,stocks,daily stock price does not reflect how well a company is doing.  short term traders buy on the run up and sell off on the news
2021-04-28 03:07:21,stocks,"Most companies sell of after earnings unless there is a major surprise. Microsoft had a huge run up before earnings so people talking profits now. Stock needs to rest a bit before it's next run up. 

There may also be another rotation into the recovery stocks (materials, financials, industrials, etc...) as there are some rates seem to.be creeping up again. Inflation is an issue too so there may be a small healthy pullback. 

You may also want to consider XLK as it has both Apple and Microsoft at about 40% weight so any pullback to the $135s on this would be a good way to diversify and get even more shares for the next leg up. 

I missed the MSFT rally from the $220s and if there is a nice pullback, I will look to get in."
2021-04-28 03:27:56,stocks,Because buy on rumors sell on facts
2021-04-28 03:57:11,stocks,"The stock price was already factored in by those who knew they were going to have a good earnings report.

So bought it months ago then sold at the peak when the earnings report was released."
2021-04-28 04:10:39,stocks,There is no logic other than long term the market rises.
2021-04-28 04:51:45,stocks,Hedgies need some type of news catalyst to cover their position dumps. Not come off too desperate when they need to liquidate. Why are they dumping? And so aggressively? To cover their shorts they are mandated to cover of course. It‚Äôs bad. Wednesday... aka today in the market? Watch out yall. Protect your capital
2021-04-28 06:12:16,stocks,Already priced in. Buy the rumers sell the news
2021-04-28 06:48:44,stocks,Because people who have been holding sell on good news.
2021-04-28 07:19:16,stocks,"The price of the stock doesn't reflect how the company does, it reflects what the market's expectations are.

It could be the market expected even bigger earnings, or having grown earnings larger now means a little less growth is expected in the future."
2021-04-28 08:02:32,stocks,"When you see this type of event it tells where we are in the cycle.  Early in the cycle good news is good news and a surprise beat really moves the stock,  Later when the cycle has been going on for 3-4 quarters the market has a different attitude.  ""oh, you always beat by 5%, You're going to have to do better than that!""  This only shows up late in a cycle.  Fast money has been looking for new sectors for 6 weeks now.  Tech has been an overweight and money is leaving.  Hey great report but I'm not adding to tech right now.  People are buying energy,shipping, hotels , airlines, recovery and reopening names are the rage now.  BTW all the lockdown names are going to start running into really tough quarterly comparisons.  While this is the last tough quarterly comparison for recovery names.  If you are a Hotel and you compare pre covid to post covid results things took shitty.  Next Q it will be post covid to post covid.  A much easier comparison."
2021-04-28 08:28:24,stocks,"Microsoft beat expectations thanks to strong growth rates across the board. Specifically, its Azure public cloud unit, Xbox content, and services unit kept the momentum. 

EPS: $1.95 vs $1.78 est  
Revenue: $41.71B, +19% YoY growth

$MSFT tumbled 3% after hours."
2021-04-28 09:41:08,stocks,Because it just ran up to 260 from 230 over a few weeks.
2021-04-28 10:33:33,stocks,Everything‚Äôs going down on positive Q reports....it‚Äôs taking hype and/or something bigger to get markets moving. All the markets are acting up
2021-04-28 10:48:59,stocks,It's pretty funny how people seem to think that average analysts' expectation matches the market's expectation. People shouldn't be surprised when stuff like this happens
2021-04-28 11:16:50,stocks,"Earnings plays are risky because good earnings are usually already priced into the stock price weeks before. If the earnings don‚Äôt absolutely smash records, the prices drops a bit. People have their own expectations so the company‚Äôs forecast doesn‚Äôt really matter anymore."
2021-04-28 11:36:25,stocks,for a trillion dollar company they need to smash earnings AND do my grocery runs AND give me a handjob AND tuck me in to bed to go up 10% AH
2021-04-28 11:55:30,stocks,"When stocks like this go down, think of them as On Sale!"
2021-04-28 12:40:48,stocks,Not going to lie getting a bit annoyed with these posts.  Join a swing/day trading subreddit if you are going to be bothered by a 3% slide after earnings.  MSFT is a stock you hold for the next decade.  3% will be a rounding error in the grand scheme of things.
2021-04-28 12:47:20,stocks,"Today is actually *less* volatile and crazy than I was expecting so far. We have the double whammy of the multiple big tech earnings reports yesterday and today and a Powell speech. 

I see the Microsoft dip as a buying opportunity. Great company, tons of growth, and cloud is super hot. 

Anyway, stuff dropping after good earnings is normal. Institutions have their own internal expectations and wind up trimming their positions based on the new data. It's a great buying opportunity for buy-and-holders."
2021-04-28 15:11:37,stocks,"We can just as easily be puzzled by the 10% run up the last 30 days. 

Bottom line is that we are still up 7% in 30 days... I cant really be upset about that."
2021-04-28 03:21:43,stocks,Market no longer makes sense. Companies beating estimates even with covid and chip shortages and they still talk after earnings. This isn‚Äôt normal
2021-04-27 22:00:35,stocks,I've got 900 bucks to dump into Microsoft that I earned from doge coin. Should I put it all in?
2021-04-28 00:57:54,stocks,any good price to go into MSFT?

2021-04-28 11:30:40,stocks,"Good stock to own, terrible products to use.  Sorry, still bitter I wasted all weekend on a couple of servers running their attempt at an SQL server that suddenly started blue screening after updates.  Had to reinstall the OS completely.  The tech was supposed to upgrade only one at a time because of Microsoft-created problems like this, but he was impatient and unfortunately did both at the same time so he killed both the master and the replica."

2021-04-28 03:04:54,stocks,"Same happened to AAPL last quarter. 

Net income up 4% Y/Y

Revenue up 5.5% Y/Y

Market Cap up 100% Y/Y

People wondering why it dropped."
2021-04-28 03:37:20,stocks,"How does this explain that it dipped just after beating earnings ? The fact that it was overvalued and had gone up was known for a long time, so you are trying to explain a puzzling short term move using a well-known long term trend.

It would make more sense if you argued that some investors used this opportunity to take profits because they decided to reduce their exposure to MSFT or because they are re-positioning in expectation of a market crash.

It would make even more sense if you argued that short term traders played the earnings announcement against the dumb money.

Notice that I am not invested in MSFT since I think that US tech megacaps are in bubble territory. But people grasping for conventional explanations of moves which are almost certainly due to institutional traders is a sad sight to behold. Earnings announcements are a classical play for hedge funds and other short term traders. You can't deduce much from them if you are a long term investor, in which case they should not really affect your decision since you already have a solid fundamental thesis. For example, if you think that MS was seriously overvalued before earnings then you shouldn't be investing in it anyway (or should have used this as an opportunity to reduce your exposure to it)."
2021-04-27 22:14:53,stocks,Sure but not long ago the markets expectations were aligned with and based on analyst estimates. That‚Äôs no longer the case.
2021-04-28 01:28:03,stocks,"\+1 - For the last 20 years that I've been investing this has been the case. It's always about what the shareholders (""market"") expects not what analysts are projecting. Sure sometimes the analysts projections match what the market is pricing in, but I don't count on it."
2021-04-27 21:13:07,stocks,"A little, depends on the company, their stock price(value), and if there is a history of sandbagging estimates (eg if there is a whisper number). 

Microsoft had a solid run up over the last 3 weeks on little news and was priced for perfection going into earnings. Not all stocks are like that - I think expectations are really really high for big tech."

Really ?"
2021-04-28 05:02:05,stocks,Doesn‚Äôt that mean it goes up on earnings? It just does it before the earnings come out because the market knows they will be good.
2021-04-28 07:08:38,stocks,daily/weekly/monthly dips couldn't matter less in a stable company such as msft. buy whenever you can and hold forever.
2021-04-28 07:21:25,stocks,"this is literally it. they beat the earnings by a lot, yes. BUT they only barely beat the extreme expections they had. and THIS is the reason for the downturn. in the long run this is good news and it remains a forever hold."
2021-04-28 04:28:11,stocks,"That's wrong.

MSFT LTM Net Profit is $55.5bn, implying a 34.5x LTM PE ratio.

2021-04-27 22:07:47,stocks,Exactly. It‚Äôs a money printer. I put 15k in three years ago at $94 dollars. Best investment I‚Äôve made. One of those ones I won‚Äôt sell for a very long time.

2021-04-28 00:07:50,stocks,you shouldn't be needing anyone else's advice here. you just need to learn a bit about investing. do your due diligence. figure out what kind of an investor you are with regards to time line and risk tolerance. I have my money in 45 different stocks and REITS. I sleep better now. I have a couple of stocks that I am heavily weighted in at the moment but I am working on fixing that. once I diversify some more. I will be able to sail through any and all market corrections and volatility. hope this helps. good luck
2021-04-28 07:31:16,stocks,Way better investment than a meme coin producing 5 Billion new coins a year. Consider yourself lucky. I think MSFT is a way better future bet

2021-04-28 00:35:51,stocks,Well. You have abilities far beyond mine. I tried doing that with Canadian banks. They are not as volatile as big tech and after the last time I sold The Royal Bank RY at 100$. I am still waiting for the pullback ü§£üòÇüôè
2021-04-28 05:17:36,stocks,"When a stock goes up X% over a period, it's moving for a reason. They are expectations of a specific growth target. 

So if a stock goes up 50%, and everyone is expecting a growth of 20%, and deliver 15% growth, while it seems great it didn't meet anyone's expectations. 

So dipping after beating earnings following a massive runup makes sense. Market was expecting a much better beat or guidance compared to what was released."

Nowadays such trades are usually placed and run using algorithms based on various criteria (including, among others, market sentiment gathered automatically by scraping social media) so it's somewhat of a fool's errands to try to 'explain' them. I have noticed similar trades for example related to the recent earnings announcements of BP and Canon, which you can check out for comparison."

Not trying to force my opinion onto you, but I don't think we should see P/E as a fix threshold. The more you think a company will stay relevant in the comming decade then the more its ok for investor to buy at a slightly higher P/E. If you are only buying companies with a P/E under 15x, you might end-up being overly bearish on many opportunities. I can't see MSFT becoming less relevant in the next 20 years, so for me a 34x P/E is not a reason not to buy the stock.

Edits:  
Just wanted to add that 34x P/E is not that bad for a Big Cap:  
Amzn: 80x  
AAPL: 36.8  
Google: 41x  
Tesla: 1100x   
You could argue that TECH in general is overvalued. Maybe, but i just wanted to point out that many strong Companies have a high P/E ratio."

I have a wider quantitative analysis of market moves that led me to this conclusion in the case of MSFT, though of course there is no way to be sure.

Moreover, you often virulently attack other posters using gross insults (which I can't reproduce here due to the auto-moderator) and you spread massive falsehoods about the political situation in China and about the geopolitical positioning of Australia, Canada, the European Union etc. as well as about public attitudes in Europe and other Western countries in hopes of promoting a pro-CCP agenda.

Active Directory - Almost Every Company uses this for User management. Requires Windows Server.  

MS Office - is the industry standard. Yes, you can get by with an open source alternative, but good luck convincing Corporations to use it. 

Exchange - See MS Office.

Sharepoint - Used everywhere for team collaboration. There are people in large companies whose sole job is to maintain Sharepoint intranet sites. This is a huge, lucrative product that most people do not realize exists until they work in an office building. 

Azure - If you don't know what this is, then you have no business in this conversation, Sorry.

Big boys hating it is no secret or even subtlety at all.

My wild speculation is that its going to be hated for a long long time, but if it keeps so consistently delivering i wouldn't be surprised that one day we will wake up and it will have doubled in value. Is that going to happen and what day ? God knows, we sit with our own dick in the hand meanwhile. If we could predict such things we would be billionaires by now."

2021-04-27 22:52:42,stocks,"Same. I bought in at $11.77 and I am staying long too.

I'm expecting a few more bumps and not as quite as strong of a gain as we've had in the last 2 years though.

It's good to see the Intel-AMD partial duopoly form again. INTC has a good market, low P/E ratio and a dividend. I don't see them going anywhere. If it dips anymore, like it did in November, I might take a long smaller stake in INTC as a small hedge to AMD."

2021-04-28 00:03:48,stocks,"Intel is getting left behind by AMD and Apple both. Intel is a generation behind and if AMD comes out with a chip to match Apple's new M1 chip, Intel is toast. Intel's chip's are literally toast, as their chips are burning up when pushed."
2021-04-28 00:10:23,stocks,Intel's problems are a bit overblown. Even on 14nm Intel's quarterly revenue is 2x AMD's full year revenue. Going forward with Intel booking TSMC's 7nm capacity and moving to 10nm it's unlikely that AMD will be able to dominate the CPU market.
2021-04-27 22:06:10,stocks,">people who are buying don‚Äôt understand how bad the lack of manufacturing capabilities of Intel are. They are several years behind TSM. AMD is almost guaranteed to eat intels market share for the next 5 years.

>tldr: people aren‚Äôt doing their DD whatsoever

this is a bit condescending...this is one of the early pieces of information a person would find about about intel. its been very well known for a while. i think its more than possible that a person knows this and still think Intel has room to growth."
2021-04-28 02:01:57,stocks,"They really aren't though.  Size is only part of the story.  Despite what most reviewers show.  Intel actually is faster in some benchmarks even with the 10 series compared to Amd's 5000 series.  However that's only some, but certainly not most.  Amd overall has the faster chip.  If Intel gets at the same nm + does a similar chiplet design, or better yet does something similar to what Apple is doing then you could see the tables turn very quickly.  I have a feeling Alder Lake is going to surprise a lot of people also, but I could be wrong."
2021-04-27 23:35:39,stocks,Foundries are expensive. AMD doesn't have them. Intel's haven't been good enough to lease capacity. This is their second run at it. Which will be a full node behind TSMC's if Intel were to hit their target dates even after accounting for density disparity in naming.
2021-04-27 23:18:14,stocks,"Yup. Intel has deep pockets and government backing now. It'll take a bit but intel isn't getting love right now because investors are skeptical of their foundry plans, and how it contradicts them also being willing to outsource to Taiwan for the time being. 

Intel is a massive company, they will come back. It's a good buy and hold. Pat is going to be a way better CEO than bob swan as well. Businessmen cannot run semi companies, it never works out well. You need an engineer."
2021-04-27 23:52:59,stocks,"I do look and listen to every earning call. Do you? I don't think so because you're missing a massive point here.

AMD has been reporting growth in the data center, desktop, and GPU market quarter over quarter. The last and current quarter reported >95% growth year over year. Yes, that is already priced in as you said but not the celining. I think $120 is easily possible.

Intel on the other hand has been reporting a loss of 20% in the data center quarter over quarter. They've been losing market in multiple segments. They've made less profit ever since last year and now with the new spending their profit will significantly go down. $2B alone this quarter.

What I'm saying is Intel is already imploding and the stock price is reflecting that."
2021-04-27 23:57:00,stocks,"I understand what you're saying.

Them having a plant to make chips doesn't make them special in my opinion. Yes, it makes them stand out as a company. It doesn't make them stand out as a seller of a product though. When a business comes to but a chip, they want performance, not prestige.

Their manufacturing skills is only special if it was competitive, which unfortunately it isn't. The whole company got lazy and just kept upping the prices without caring about innovation.

Lets see what this new CEO brings and the big IFF for 7nm in 2023 they have to deal with. Still, I'd still be asking my question: Why would anyone buy this stock now? They're going to report less and less until 2023. But then, or just before then."
2021-04-28 00:55:39,stocks,Both companies will continue to grow because the market will continue to expand
2021-04-27 23:45:52,stocks,"Nokia was giant too.

Intel won't be TSMC. TSMC is the new TSMC. They spend $30B or so in R&D and new plants. They already spend more than Intel and are opening a new factory in Arizona.

There isn't a chip shortage. There is an idiotic auto manufacturer supply request problem. They lowered the amount requested, the chip manufacturer gave that quota to someone else, demand picked up for cars, auto manufacturers came back to want that quota but it was sold already, chip manufacturing takes time so hint the ""shortage""

Neither AMD nor Nvidia is having a shortage.

Edit: To add to all of this, Intel has a supply problem. No one wants their product but they have a large plant to make them. AMD has the other problem, they have something like 75% of the 7nm quota from TSMC but demand is so high they can't keep up. Hint the large growth in data center this quarter and Intel's loss of >20% data center quarter over quarter."
2021-04-28 02:13:35,stocks,"It's not the best though lol, in the US or outside."
2021-04-28 04:00:54,stocks,"Yeah? I forgot, PE is more important than LITERALLY losing >20% in data center.

You do not understand PE and its relation to the stock price."
2021-04-27 20:27:08,stocks,Why? I made this move a long time ago when I started investing. I invested in only things I knew without doing DD. I believe I got really lucky and to this day. 7/8th my portfolio is in ETF and mutual funds. I only have 6 stock stocks that I truly believe in LONG term. I only started investing 5 years ago and I was stupid not to dollar cost average the last two years because I was spending money on butter.
2021-04-27 23:05:16,stocks,"Yah. Me too! At the time I bought at 4.35. I could have bought a 1,000 shares but I ended up buying stuff like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia."

2021-04-28 01:04:26,stocks,Plus TSMC and Samsung keep adding capacity on newer nodes. I'd be very surprised if any of the majors are expanding 40nm and older capacity currently.

2021-04-28 01:10:54,stocks,"It's a lot easier to grow when your sales are relatively small, so percentages don't tell the full story in this comparison. AMD is priced for perfection, and Intel is still a juggernaut with all the opportunity in the world to adapt to competition. AMD is nearing half of Intel's worth on a little over a tenth of the earnings, with WAY less money being spent on R&D for future growth opportunities. It's obvious to see why many would prefer investing in Intel at these valuations."
2021-04-27 23:12:59,stocks,"After one of their earnings last year same thing happened... It dropped to 44 and I bought more, sold before earnings because I knew I'd be able to pick more up cheaper. Newer investors don't like intel because they're older. But they're a powerhouse and very undervalued even with their issues. The amount of money they bring in is ridiculous.

Their Q1 revenue was practically the exact same as last year even with the datacenter loss in revenue, which, btw, still was higher than 2018 and 2019. Maybe you shouldn't be blowing the death horn with the first blip on the radar?

If INTC commonly trades at 200B-ish on 20B in net revenue, why is AMD so exciting when it's approaching 100B with 20B net revenues probably 5+ years away? If the market treats it like it's treated Intel the last 20 years, you're in for boring market returns if you buy in now. 

What you don't seem to grasp about Intel is that they make so much money for how cheap they are, they could practically *accept* death and still return the current price of their shares in cash with just the business they have on the horizon with zero breakthroughs. It's very unique in this overvalued market. I'm not currently an investor, but the value is evident."

I believe it is >55% if you include all the matured process nodes. If you only include 40nm or below, it will be 28%. All these number are also excluding Intel, because intel is not considered a fab. It is hard to gauge how much fab capacity Intel has, but consider how much CPU they chip, it will not be small.

And then Intel can fabricate their high end chips using TSMC, while continue to fab mid to low end using their own 10nm."

2021-04-28 07:15:41,stocks,"I know that $2B is coming from R&D. It'll probably not be enough and they'll still miss their target like they did previously. Either way, less profit = less profit. It's. Negative, no other way to look at it.

AMDs has more products now, it's. No inky dinky company. They also don't have the R&D costs that Intel has to deal with. GPUs for consumers and data center bring in a lot of money on their own, along with console CPUs. AMD is targeting GPU and CPU, along with semi customs. So it's not just $200B net worth, it's more than that. It's Intel and Nvidia combined. Sure they don't have all the products and they're not now equal to both, but that's their target.

Says you. I'd say the death horn was blown years ago as I kept reiterating every quarter to investors. Since 2017, it's just now slowly coming to fruition. It's a slow death because they have a lot of cash. Sure, they could get their shit together. Their history doesn't prove that though, and they have a long road ahead."
2021-04-28 00:48:38,stocks,"True, but FPGA with normal CPU hybrid can still compete. Lisa Su seems bullish on semi custom, though I worry about a lack of ARM plan."

2021-04-28 08:20:11,stocks,"Not R&D, that's a separate line. 

Regardless of what additional they sell, I'm just talking price/earning multiples. It's going to take them a long time to match today's Intel on earnings, and if the market ends up treating them like they treated mature Intel, it's not exactly exciting. No one really knows for sure though, it's just something to consider when paying a speculative price for a company in a similar sector. Intel is dipping their toes back into non-integrated GPUs this year anyway, and Nvidia is getting into some forms of CPUs.

You say they were dying in 2017, but 2018 was their 2nd biggest YoY revenue growth in the last decade. Six consecutive years of top-line growth doesn't really paint the picture of a dying company. A company that prints a lot of cash can usually find a way to survive and grow by throwing profits back into the company. That's how all the tech giants came to be, and why Intel now owns something peculiar like a self-driving car unit set to top over a billion in revenue this year. When there's no more profits to re-invest, that'll be the time to panic."
2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, April 27, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 27, 2021**

Stocks turned modestly lower Tuesday, as market participants awaited for more corporate earnings results and commentary from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

This week, a slew of huge companies are set to report corporate earnings for the first quarter of 2021. Altogether, the market caps of the companies reporting this week comprise nearly half the total market cap of the S&P 500, according to FactSet. So far, the vast majority of companies have vastly exceeded analyst estimates, with effective vaccine distribution in the US helping stoke demand as the economy gradually reopens. 

Eighty-four percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter results to date posted a positive earnings per share surprise, according to data from FactSet. This would mark the highest percentage of companies reporting upside surprises since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008, assuming this beat rate holds through the end of earnings season. 

Today kicked off the first of the FOMC‚Äôs two-day rate-setting meeting. The event is extremely unlikely to lead to any major shifts in monetary policy, with officials reiterating their commitment to keeping policy highly accommodative as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic. This includes maintaining interest rates near zero and maintaining an aggressive asset purchasing program at a monthly rate of $120 billion. In an earlier meeting, Powell said the Central Bank would slow the pace of its bond purchase program ‚Äúwell before‚Äù raising interest rates. Powell said, ‚ÄúWe will taper asset purchases when we‚Äôve made substantial further progress toward our goals from last December when we announced that guidance. That would in all likelihood be well before the time we consider raising rates.‚Äù

In other news, according to a report by the Conference Board, consumer confidence has surged to a 14-month high in April as effective distribution of the vaccine and easing of social distancing guidelines in the US allows for the economy to gradually reopen. The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index jumped to a reading of 121.7 in April, or well above the 113.0 expected. Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement, ‚ÄúConsumers‚Äô assessment of current conditions improved significantly in April, suggesting the economic recovery strengthened further in early Q2. Consumers‚Äô optimism about the short-term outlook held steady this month. Consumers were more upbeat about their income prospects, perhaps due to the improving job market and the recent round of stimulus checks.‚Äù

TL;DR adblockers aren't really as big of a deal as people think they are. I also think people over-estimate the number of people that care about adblocking."

Facebook is social media, that's what it's known for.
Apple is IoT, that's that it's known for.
Google is search, that's what it's known for.
Amazon is logistics, that's what it's known for.


What do you think digital infrastructure is? It's responsible for receiving requests, packaging them, sending them across various routes in a network, arriving to a destination and unloading it. What do you think e-commerce and deliveries are? Do you see how, WHEN BOILING IT DOWN, how Amazon may be viewed as logistics? How Facebook is centered around media & communications?

I think it continues because they do not want the negative PR.  They clearly have the capability as YouTube TV does not have a way to block the ads.

I do NOT think they will suddenly switch.  I would bet they do it gradually.   So put one ad initially in that can not be removed.

Once they do this it will increase the YouTube Premium subscriptions.

But Google does not really need it yet.   It is something they have and can use at some point in the future.   They just put up over a 100% increase in profits.  Which is coming off of a quarter with over 40% increase in profits.  They clearly do not need it at this point.

They did make a move with the unlimited Photo.    Which is pretty big as it ends an expense while increasing revenues.     That starts in June.   Should be worth a few billion to the bottom line.

Google just has so many assets yet to be monetized.

That's a trillion dollar Tam. While it may never overtake market share from azure or aws, it's such a massive industry, literally all of computing, that even 20% would mean hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. And keep in mind that the margins of services built on top of the infrastructure are where the margins are, not the vms themselves. This is why azure is growing so fast in terms of revenue while lagging behind aws in iaas.

Google has essentially the largest training set in the world and is at the forefront of ml. This manifests itself in extremely important products like recommendation engines, photo and video classification, and indeed identifying trends in business.

I also personally think that it's going to be either waymo or cruise that dominate the self driving car market long-term. 

Feel free to short long term though.

Edit also why is their cloud business growth slower than azure? You realize the distinction between gcp and cloud? Cloud includes workspaces /gsuite. No doubt msft has been crushing it with azure though. However, here's a key distinction. Azure and aws are profit centers for their companies while Google will burn billions to get market share"

It is just another example of where Google profitability will improve.  It is double with Google Photos which is just ideal.

Consider this: a stock price can be ""frozen"" at a set price if no one buys or sells or changes position.  So, the market can crash, the market can boom - but this ""frozen"" stock would just stay frozen at a set price.  To me the true value of a stock lies with what people are willing to buy and sell it for.  Tesla's market cap is a good example of how financials can't dictate what a stock does."
2021-04-27 21:06:11,stocks,"**What even is ""intrinsic value""?**

From a hundred people you'll likely get a hundred different answers. Some people think the intrinsic value is *equivalent* to the market value, either by some efficient market hypothesis or by the argument that something's true value is just what people say it is. There is no widely agreed-upon definition for intrinsic value.

The whole idea behind intrinsic value is to apply it in the context of a margin of safety, to minimize the risk you take on in investing (and hopefully, also maximize your potential profit). In the same vein, you should try to be conservative with how you determine the intrinsic value. You determine a range that you figure could reasonably contain what you'd call the intrinsic value, and if the market value of the stock falls out of that range, it's either selling too cheaply or too expensively. To illustrate, imagine someone says they would like to sell you their dining room chair for $10000. You say, ""Well, that's insanity, there's no way I'd ever pay that much for it."" That's because you **know** its intrinsic value is probably closer to *about* $30. You leave them to it in hopes that they'll eventually come to their senses and offer the thing at a more reasonable price.

There's no rule that says the market value has to return to some price that is close to some intrinsic value, though. It's just that we assume if something is **clearly** priced too high, people will eventually realize it and the price will reflect that; vice versa for those priced too low."
2021-04-28 07:12:55,stocks,"Confirmation bias and survivorship bias. It's basically just a patient, conservative version of mean reversion, a strategy employed often with intraday price moved by algotraders.

When it works, their theory is confirmed.

When it doesn't, they state their theory was correct, but maybe they got a detail wrong or there was a black swan event that explains away their poor performance.

Sometimes if a stock is trading below it's intrinsic value or above it, it can just stay that way forever. 

I prefer the view that the price will eventually rise to whatever the person with the worst sense of its value will pay for it"
2021-04-27 23:28:36,stocks,Okay... why does it have higher probability?
2021-04-28 07:15:39,stocks,"Because they have the conviction to hold it until it rises and therefore assume they were right, despite the fact that the market as a whole may have risen during that time. Confirmation bias and investors trying to think they have control over everything."
2021-04-28 09:33:06,stocks,"Mean-reversion.  It's pretty much a statistical law of nature that arises purely from the way numbers behave and has nothing at all to do with stocks *per se*.

The catch, of course, is that the mean (""intrinsic value"") mustn't change terribly much over the span of time you're looking for reversion to the mean."
2021-04-28 00:00:00,stocks,"Analyzing an Earnings Report (quick and short version) For earnings reports, public companies are required to submit a 10-Q (quarterly report) or annual report (10-K) with the SEC. The 10-Q is unaudited, meaning it has not been approved by a certified external auditor. The 10-K is audited. You can read more about the details of 10-Q and 10-K forms on any financial website. Or google.

So let's go over the fast way to read an earnings report.

1. Before an earnings report releases, make sure you look at the past earnings metrics or have it with you to compare the upcoming earnings report. Some things to consider about any earnings report: sentiment going into earnings, industry momentum, and macro condition can affect the swings in stock price to make option plays worthless. Trade carefully.
2. Take a look at the revenues, earnings per share, and net income. Compare it to past quarters and the last few years in that same quarter. Did the company grow Q/Q and Y/Y? Does the company have a history of seasonal cycles?
3. Look at expenses. Did they spend more/less than previous quarters/years? What was the operational margin? What's the profit margin on their products and/or services? Was there anything unusual in their operational/product expenses that wouldn't normally be there?
4. If a company performs poorly compared to estimates, do research on why. Some variables can be: supply chain issues (like many companies are having right now), decreasing demand in their products/service, increasing competition, changing trends, talent going to other companies, execution of various strategies (marketing for example), etc.
5. Even if a company performs well after an earnings report, take a look why. It's easy when you your favorite company's stock goes up. It's green, it doesn't matter. Well in fact it does. Because if you want your favorite company to perform well in every or most quarters in the future, you have to understand its business model. Pay attention to their guidance and how the executives phrase their words. An [article back in 2017](https://review.chicagobooth.edu/finance/2017/article/how-listen-hidden-data-earnings-calls) dissected the words from 17,419 earnings call transcripts. On average, ""have an issue"" ranked in the top phrase used in those calls coming at just more than 3%. In those calls it was repeated just more than 5 times. Coming in 2nd was ""headwind"" and was repeated just over 10 times in an earnings call. In short, listen to the earnings call or read the transcript. News media outlets will spin words to make a company appear bad (like Tesla) when in reality nothing bad happened. Educate yourselves. Media is just noise.

So in short, ask yourselves:

How did the company perform financially Q/Q and Y/Y? What factors led to these results? What does guidance say about its future? Will the financials grow more, less, or the same? What are the headwinds and tailwinds? Will upcoming trends and macroeconomical conditions affect future growth?

If you can answer these questions, you're on a good path. If you cannot, more research is required.

For some companies, understanding their business model and the industry they're in can be difficult to assess. Tesla is a great example because of the extremes of the two sides, bulls and bears (TESLAQ). Tesla is in a unique position because their earnings consist of EV credits, and in this earnings cycle, they sold about $100 million in Bitcoin. They also didn't have an S/X models delivered or produced because of the refresh. So how did the company beat on earnings? What's their guidance? I'll leave that for all to research yourselves :)

Anyway, this is just a quick way to understanding earnings reports. Understanding a company's potential is based on some factors like the industry its in, business model, and more. It takes a few hours or less to read an earnings report and understanding the financials. It takes hours or days to actually understand a company as a whole. IMO, don't read stock books. Read about businesses, the industries they're in, their TAM/SAM/SOM. If you really want to make money, you need to understand where the world is transitioning to. Ask, ""are electric vehicles the future?"", ""is telemedicine relevant even after COVID?"", ""do I and my friends/family/coworkers go to the gym anymore? or do we attend zoom fitness classes?"", ""are users moving away from Netflix to other streaming services?"". Notice the products and services you and your peers use. 

Hope this helps some people with their research!"

i understand how CSP work. (atleast in robinhood).

if you sell to open lets say arbitrarily, $40p 14 may 21  on company ABC. to open a CSP, you need $4000 in cash in your account. this cash gets tied up and you get the premium. if underlying goes below $40, you buy 100 shares of ABC at $40 each with the $4k that was tied up. if it stays above, you pocket the premium and you get your $4k back.

now what about when you open a put w/o having the cash? what happens?

2021-04-28 05:53:36,stocks,"Nice and basic analysis, and very kind of you to share the dataset!

I took the liberty to dive in and do some analyses myself. So, I just ran a (very) quick & dirty linear regression analysis on the SPY-corrected difference in stock price between baseline and twelve weeks after the recommendation for a subset of the dataset (I only included straight ""Buy"", ""Sell"" or ""Hold"" advices, and excluded the rest, resulting in \~25.000 advices to still be included). And found no significant association between the recommendation (Buy, Hold or Sell) and the corrected price difference over 12 weeks (Weight of -2.88e-3 and 6.97e-5 with a *p*\-value of 0.114 and 0.985 respectively for Hold and Sell recommendations, with Buy for reference at intercept 1.01). 

Then I decided to ""rate the ratings"" and see if the recommendations were correlated with twelve week price differences. For simplicity I rated the recommendations ""good advice"" and ""bad advice"". Good advice is defined as either a ""Sell"" recommendation combined with a price decrease twelve weeks later (corrected for SPY) or a ""Hold"" or ""Buy"" recommendation combined with a price increase after twelve weeks. A recommendation to sell combined with a price increase OR a recommendation to Hold or Buy combined with a stable price or a decreasing price are all considered bad advice. I didn't run any statistics on this, but based on the numbers you can see that there's about a 50-50 chance the recommendation is either good advice or bad:

&#x200B;

||Good advice|Bad advice|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Buy|9119|8515|
|Hold|3032|3033|
|Sell|583|600|

&#x200B;

So basically based on this analysis (which is far from perfect, again: I only did a quick and dirty analysis without being concerned too much about any misshapes in the data and what not + only included \~25.000 out of the \~66.000 cases + did not correct for confounders such as year/month of recommendation, which firm gave the recommendation, etc.) I found no association between recommendations and twelve week price difference twelve weeks later.

Now if I can find the time I'm gonna put some more thought in this analysis. A lot of improvements can be made. First of all the inclusion of more recommendations should good. Secondly, you can argue whether you should correct for SPY, because this is only fair if you're looking for stocks that outperform the market. Basically a ""hold"" advice for a stock that will still increase, albeit not as much as the rest of the market, is not really ""bad advice"", since you don't lose any money in that case. Also, I would like to include confounders such as year when the advice was given (not every bookyear shows the same increase/decrease in stock prices overall, although the fact that I corrected for SPY here could also correct stock price for year-on-year market fluctuations. Still, not including the year or even month that the recommendation was given in the analysis as a confounder is an assumption that correcting for SPY will solve this issue, and every assumption is a risk.) But most importantly: one should first take a good look at the discriptive statistics before even starting a thorough analysis.

I would issue a sell recommendation when it looks like the market fundamentals do not justify the current price.

You can easily compare two percentages in other ways? For example, for what % of years did a fund beat the market index. This would give you an idea of the volatility of returns, a key measure in investment assessment. And in fact, I believe risk adjusted returns is by far more broadly used than BP over market.

>The cumulative return difference between SPY and the stock is much smaller than the OP's numbers suggest.

I agree with that, but you're arguing there is a one and done way of comparing funds, which is nonsense. There are no perfect statistical measures to analyse complex phenomena. Each is subject to bias.

If you measure CAGR over the last 10 years, you would bias yourself towards funds that did well in earlier years even if they have done poorly recently, as opposed to the reverse. Due to the natural effect of compounding and the decreasing overall yield in the market.

>Bp point difference is what statisticians call ""difference in differences"", albeit usually for non-time-series data.

No, these are measures of financial health. I'm not talking about indicators, I'm talking about the problematic measure of differences in percentages that OP uses, which is a non-starter mathematically because the whole point of percentages if that they're normalised already, you don't renormalise them *with one another*. 

>If BP above market was deemed to be a reliable measure of future performance (which is after all, what we care about here), then we would expect the market to react pretty quickly as results are released, and fees to be adjusted accordingly. We don't see this.

You're misunderstanding my point. The numbers quantify past performance, they're not used to forecast future performance. In equilibrium, without fees and high minimum investment requirements, capital would flow to funds that outperform consistently.  This is how hedge funds become big and lose that consistent double digit return years.

You would still need bp point difference in this case. The most common measure of this, the Sharpe ratio, still uses the (R\_i - R\_f)/sd. The difference is the bp point difference. Again, I think you're conflating percentages and financial indicators.

>It's been a long time since I've done proper statistics, but this doesn't seem to be what difference-in-differences measures at all. DID measures the effect of sudden changes on outcomes, not performance differences of different actors over time.

You can definitely run DiD time series regressions. This is how you quantify differences in fund performance in academia and estimate models. Most DiD is used for panel data because you usually want to retrieve some treatment effect (e.g. drug trials) but in finance you can run regressions with the market as the control. A good example of this is the evaluation of company performance in fields dominated by private equity and those that aren't.

No DiD measures the effect of a treatment."

>I'm not talking about indicators, I'm talking about the problematic measure of differences

What is the difference between a quantitative ""indicator"" and a ""measure of differences""? Don't you think people will compare indicators? Like Microsoft's P/E was 2 times market average, versus being 15x higher (additive) than market average. Both methods of comparison are valid and informative. If market P/E is 10x in 2010 and 20x in 2020. Obviously the statement that Microsoft's P/E is 15x higher than the market has different implications (i.e. MSFT having 25x and 35x P/E in each respective year).

>measures of financial health

None of those measures are of financial health. They all relate to price which has nothing to do with the 'health' of the company, only to do with the company as an investment prospect.

>The numbers quantify past performance, they're not used to forecast future performance.

I think you're wilfully ignoring a bit of implicit context around financial analysis. The only reason financial analysis (or maybe 99% of it) exists is to make future decisions which depend on forecasted performance. This is the reason why I'm even reading this subreddit, this is the reason why OP posted his post, and I'm willing to bet this is the reason you're here as well.

>The most common measure of this, the Sharpe ratio...The difference is the bp point difference.

I have no idea what you mean by this. The Sharpe ratio is a number. Any number can be expressed as a %. Any % can be expressed as basis points. 

And the Sharpe Ratio is commonly used, this in no way means it's the only and best way to analyse anything. 

>You can definitely run DiD time series regressions. This is how you quantify differences in fund performance in academia and estimate models. 

I wasn't able to find any papers which mentioned this methodology, could you link some?

>No DiD measures the effect of a treatment.

I might be misusing the technical term here. But I mean a change as in the implementation of 'treatment'. I'm not seeing what treatment you are proposing as the basis for DID analysis. Again, an academic paper reference would assist."

Again, I'm not saying SR is the best measure, I'm saying it uses the difference in bp points in its formula. All of these indicators have to do so in order to compare percentages.

I'm not even remotely talking about the indicators themselves. You're understanding the statement ""you cannot compare percentages by dividing them"" as ""you should use this indicator, which uses percentages, and not any other, which would also use percentages"". They are not even anywhere near each other.

>I wasn't able to find any papers which mentioned this methodology, could you link some?

This is a pretty good example [https://www.nber.org/system/files/working\_papers/w17491/w17491.pdf](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w17491/w17491.pdf).

They estimate factor models controlling for markets plus a couple of others and time periods, then estimate the difference in return gaps, the alpha (the stuff unexplained by the factors) and the betas (the stuff being controlled for). Some results from pp 19 onwards. The difference reported is, again, in basis points because it's the only way one can compare percentages. First diff is the return, diff on diff is the difference in the returns. Diff in diff is set up in a panel data setting, so you'd have to have time-varying factors to accommodate time series. Treatment here are the factors, but you are equally interested in the treatment effect as well as the unexplained stuff.

There are a couple of other good papers on fund performance but I read them while back in undergrad and have forgotten the authors.

The point about the definition of DiD is actually very important, you observe the outcomes, you don't directly observe the effects. That's why you have to estimate them."

If you really like indicators, check out TradingView as people have made their own indicators or combination of indicators.

Warning 1: regarding stock value, these indicators usually don't take into account a stock/company's financials.  This is where you need to do your DD.  For example, sometimes a stock is oversold because it's going bankrupt.  So, you still need to do some due diligence (DD) and research on these stocks.

What I mean, is find strong companies with a good moat and little to no debt. 

Then find their ‚Äúfair value‚Äù. Then cut that number in half - that‚Äôs your buy price. 

Now you have your shopping list - a list of strong companies, with a buy price. 

Wait...wait...wait for it...and something will happen like a bad quarter or other bad news, and a stock on your shopping list will hit its buy price. There you go - simple. But not easy. Waiting is never easy."

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp

Skip to the header about "" creation and redemption"" shares will be added/removed from the total pool of shares available as a part of an algorithm to keep an ETF trading at the NAV

Now, if we were talking about a CEF, you would be correct. They tend to trade at a wider premium/discount to the NAV. Once a CEF has its IPO no new shares are created and it trades like a standard equity in that regard.  Now, there is an incentive to trade close to the NAV but a CEF is directly impacted by buy/sell action. This is not the case for an ETF, it tracks the NAV."

Your description of military work is literally the opposite of reality. Their problem is they are too lax and give too much freedom to complete tasks.

It never works. I dont feel like going into it because it will take pages to explain but lets just say I taught pmi based PM courses later so it all made sense (why those PM's sucked at their jobs).

As for people and behavior... again I dont feel like going into it. Its something you will need to experience. I work for a Korean company right now. 75% of my team is German. We have a few Pols, French, Swedes, Fins, Koreans, Japanese and a few token Canadians. Cant have a company with a left handed Canadian... its bad luck. Anyway, people are people.

2021-04-27 22:11:41,stocks,"I've recently gotten into dabbling into the stock market amid the @wallstreebets short squeeze momentum and have taken some interest in Well Health, (WELL:TSX) a Canadian company focused on telemedicine and the future of doctors visits and patient care. Given how Covid has affected people's mobility and outlined the shortcomings of patientcare infrastructure when times like these hit, this seems interesting to me. 

Especially in Canada that has such a heavily funded healthcare system. 

Anyways, I'm rambling. Here's why i thought the idea has legs. So , Well seemed to be getting shorted pretty heavily as some anonymous blogger named grizzlyreports  had put out a short report but it seemed to be written really poorly. Like a 5th grader wrote it, but a very poorly read fifth grader. This raised some flags for me so I did a bit of digging, given that there is a lot of manipulation in the markets by people paying to have campaigns put out like this when they take a large short position in a good company only to make money pushing it down and then own a good company for less when they cover and everyone who had faith in it jumps out. 

This sounded like what was happening to GME to me but to a company that is on the forefront of patient care. 

Then I found another site Called the cantech letter (Heres the link  https://www.cantechletter.com/2021/04/well-health-short-seller-attack-was-a-set-up-says-andrew-mccreath/)  that called out the Anonymous blogger ""Grizzly"" as one of these report writers who gets paid to write these parasitic reports. 

However, given that the current environment has made the general populous wise to the devious ways of short sellers, I thought that these short sellers were getting squeezed out as the price of the stock was up over 10% the day after the short report came out, and on good Volume too.. over 3M Shares! I thought maybe this was a good opportunity to hop in and maybe ride it up as the shorts get caught naked and the company keeps doing what it‚Äôs doing. 

They recently acquired CRH Medical and raised money and $9.80 Cents in their most recent raise which was above market, so the private investors seem too have faith that they are getting a good deal paying more now for more later. 

Also well has over 1300 people on its team with very strong EBITDA AND it announced today that JP Morgan upsized their credit facility to 300M up from 200M. 

All of this seems very positive, very excited to see this develop, what do you all think?

Would love to hear thoughts!"

So it's not to say that it's not possible to see more gains in such cases. What there is to say however, is that you shouldn't be too surprised that the stock wants to take a rest. It could be that a lot of people anticipated a good report (therefore it was overbought already), and now they see that this is the highest price to sell the stock at since the report wasn't mind blowing.

2021-04-27 21:34:08,stocks,"Someone may correct me, but it comes down to your specific STCG and LTCG earnings for the year. If you have a ton of losses, it would be best to maximize profit. If you have a ton of earnings it would be best to minimize profit. The reason I say this is because if you are down $3k this year, you can write it off. If you are down $4k, you can write off $3k and carry the other $1k to next year, but if you have more losses next year you just keep carrying them over and not reaping the full reward of claiming all your losses.

As a fellow trader, I hope you dont have the problem of carrying over losses. At the end of the day, we are here to make money, and Uncle Sam has his hand out. If you make $100 now and $100 later, or $200 now, you are still paying the toll to play(Unless you are holding til LTCG, in which case hold out longer to get a better tax rate)"

See OP is missing a major thing. A regular car fills up in seconds or minutes meaning each customer only stays a short while to refill, buy smokes and get back on the road. EVs are nor quick to charge, they take 20-30 minutes (!) meaning each customers will loiter for a long time. This means charging at a station is an *inconvenience*.

I'm not big on tech in my port, but I am bullish. I have about ~11% tech. I think the semiconductor stocks will be my largest holdings in that category moving forward. 

I hate crypto honestly, the function of it is all the same whether or not it's expensive. It's just whatever someone is willing to pay into it to hold it for an asset. I don't understand it the way I can read and understand a stock. But blockchain tech is a bit interesting, although I think practical use is far away.

My thesis for crypto will be to test it in a bear market, and see if it outperforms gold and metals. I have a feeling it might. But I wouldn't ever consider buying it now, it's lofty.

I don't think we're IN a bubble, I think certain sectors are in a bubble, but I think for once, big tech is not part of that. I think crypto and the ev/autos may be in slightly lofty territory, but I think it's because people are excited for the next step of innovation.

2021-04-28 12:15:58,stocks,"People will always seek out specific brands / products and not all brands / products have comparable substitutes that consumers are willing to forgo due to convenience.

There is necessity shopping: toiletries, groceries, etc. Convenience is king for this category and ample substitutes exist.

There is utility based shopping: a specific tool or product trait; i.e., a lightweight tent at x.xlb that can withstand certain conditions. A company like Grainger.com does billions in annual B2B sales because you can't find the majority of their products any where else. In fact, Amazon tried opening a MRO (maintenance repair operations) sector to compete with Grainger that largely failed.

There is recreational shopping (shopping out of enjoyment or want for a product, instead of a need for a product), which it sounds like you don't partake in, but accounts for a massive amount of e-commerce sales.

There is luxury shopping. There's a reason brands like Gucci, Hermes, Cartier, etc. have thrived for years.

Many people will shop outside of Amazon for utility and recreation. Let's look at some major Shopify brands and I'll explain why Amazon or shopping local is no substitute:

1. Tecovas.com. These are handmade cowboy boots that are on par with quality at a fraction of the price as traditional brands like Lucchese. They have built a massive cult following and drive ~$100M in sales annually. They don't sell on Amazon. No one is going to go with an alternative brand that will be less comfortable, lower quality, or higher price simply because it's more convenient to buy from Amazon. They also tend to deliver orders within 2 days, offer free shipping and a very simple return policy. Their customer service is known for taking care of any issues that may arise, such as missing packages.

2. Kylieskin.com does ~$200M a year in revenue. Simply put, Kylie has a massive fan base of recreational shoppers. Another brand could have the same exact product, but people will pay a premium to purchase from her site out of brand affinity / loyalty. 

3. Allbirds.com. They are valued at over a billion dollars and announced an IPO today. People seek them out due to utility (lightweight, breathable, comfortable, etc.), but also recreation (style). People aren't going to sub in a different brand for something they'll use day-in and day-out.

I'd also like to challenge your notion that Shopify sites don't offer the same or better customer experience that Amazon does. Most offer free & quick shipping, returns, and package protection. Shopify has easy checkout - it's the same checkout experience for thousands of sites and they save your information to purchase with minimal clicks. They offer split payment options to make it easier for folks to purchase high ticket items. 

I can go on and on, but the point is that Shopify fills a lot of Amazon's gaps and shopping is such a massive recurring activity that there's room for several players to own market share. Just because you can find 99% of the items you are interested in via Amazon does not mean that others can too."

2021-04-28 16:34:10,stocks,"Can somebody explain the Cohen / e-commerce pivot resurgence to me, and how GME will actually do well long-term?  

Yes GME absolutely needs to get into ecommerce to even stand a chance of surviving. But even if they are wildly successful at selling video game disks online in the next couple years, nobody will be buying physical disks in the (not-so-distant) future. In fact new consoles all have a diskless version that is rapidly growing in popularity, as is console-less videogame streaming. Does anybody really believe physical videogame disks won‚Äôt go the way of the CD/DVD?? 

Who cares about successfully transitioning to e-commerce if there‚Äôs no longer any product for GME to sell in 10 years? This seems completely different than Chewy where there‚Äôs no digital form of petfood taking over... if there were I‚Äôd imagine chewy would also be screwed as the digital petfood producers would themselves easily take over distribution. 

Has GME/Cohen articulated their business plan for once videogames are fully digital, or have they buried their heads in the sand and assumed used disk sales will remain a large market indefinitely?"

2021-04-27 20:14:25,stocks,"I feel the same as you, and you forgot to address eSports or Gamestop Social.

RE GME Social: There are local mom and pop shops by me that run tournaments, having a PC room, sell video games and board games, cards, etc. They barely stay afloat.

RE eSports: What company is going to pay another company to run an esport tournament? I would guess Valve isn't gonna pay to have someone host a DOTA tournament because of how much they probably make from it. 

Chewy was a different ball game. People don't realize people care about their pets, and don't want knockoff shit from China, but they most likely do not care where they get their games. Gamestop was always the last place I'd stop at, and I don't even buy any PC games except from Steam or Epic. Before this year GME was a giant meme, buy a new console, trade it in, and they give you about tree fiddy.

I also got down voted a couple weeks ago for saying the selling of shares to settle debt for restructuring is good for the longevity of GME, but bad for the squeeze, if you believe in that. The OP who made the post tried to act like settling debt was bad, and got upset that I said GME is selling shares to cover debt and asked for proof, even though GME said it in their earnings. They just kept rebuttling stating that GME they ""may"" sell shares. 

I personally believe if people actually want GME to succeed, it wouldn't matter if the stock squeezes or not. A squeeze doesn't mean anything, unless you sell, otherwise it's just unrealized gains. I'm not waiting for an AAPL squeeze, because I believe in the longevity of the company. 

Also, people saying that GME didn't sell at the peak doesn't mean much. They were warned by the SEC not to: ""We will act to protect retail investors when the facts demonstrate abusive or manipulative trading activity that is prohibited by the federal securities laws. Market participants should be careful to avoid such activity. 

My overall takeaway is the same as your sentiment. This is good for GME, but they have yet to prove themselves that they can be successful. It is an uphill battle, considering the PC space is hugely dominated, and consoles may not exist in the future, or even physical games. I hope for most people, GME does well as a ton of retail traders have money in there. 

Stocks and other assets have reached cult like mentality, and it's gotten so bad that I barely mention to anyone that I trade anymore. I believe everyone can trade, but the amount of greed that I feel from people is a bit insane."

3. Existing competition in e-commerce. Soon-to-be-voted Chairman Ryan Cohen raped e-commerce market so hard, Petco had to buy his company for billions to prevent being fucked like Blockbuster got fucked by Netflix. Amazon? got ass kicked as well. He's going for Round 2 on GME.
4. Current Market Cap: 12.5Billion.
5. Current Assets: $2.4 Billion. Current Cash on hand: \~$550 million raised last week + whatever remaining from end of last year ($436 million). current market cap is just 4x of these two, without the added value of new fanatical retail fandom, e-commerce move, new board & execs, new strategy, and their ability to captivate the entire investor market (you included).
6. From 4/05\~4/26, Gamestop sold 3.5 million shares, diluting their total stock by 5%. Stock price on 4/05: $186. Stock price today: $177

So even with your shorts, Citadel + friends shorts, regular retailer shorts, gamestop selling their own shares to dilute the pool, and post-squeeze exodus of retail (allegedly cuz noone in their right mind will buy this right?), Gamestop only managed to fall by $10 over 3 weeks.

okay, I'll bite. GME has 15x in marketcap from mid 2020 to now. Marketcap in April: $180 Mil. That's not even close to their current cash on hand. Not even close to their net liquidation worth. It's not the current market cap that's the issue, it's last year's market cap that was unreasonable.

hence, someone named ""DeepFuckingValue"" preached that this stock is undervalued, and looking for a giant comeback. Rest is history.

You already shown you don't understand how fees work and want to argue with calculators. 

Now you cannot reconcile the fact that owning the market means *you own everything in the market*. That means you own underperforming stocks and yet still have market returns of 10% for SP500 and closer to 12% for VTSAX which includes small and mid cap.

It appears that you underestimate the effects of fees. In addition to that you demonstrated that you don't know how to do the math for those calculations.

I would prefer not to own everything in the market. Some of the stuff in the market is not stuff that is something I would want and or overpriced.

I assure you that I know how to do properly do the calculations to determine my geometric mean. The fees and commissions I pay do factor into how I calculate my return.

And then there's the index fund misunderstanding, where for some reason you cannot reconcile total market performance includes underperforming businesses and yet has provided a 10-12% historical return (SPY/VTSAX). 

You are free to invest and go after that extra 1-3% fee free return, assuming you're in that ~15% who can beat the market over 30+ years. I do it as well but my understanding is based in reality and I accept that I do this mostly because I enjoy it because over the long term the hourly profit is likely to be low.

>but it's immediately profitable everytime you contine to short because you taking the money for that share upfront and able to use that to keep funding payments on position while your using up all the buyers ammo.

huh, you literally borrow a share (and pay to do it) and sell it at market price, how is that immediate profit? you lose money on the trade given cost to borrow. you only start gaining money if the stock falls.

a stock is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it, sure you can short term suppress the demand by flooding the supply but its pretty much impossible to meaningfully depress a stock significantly below value without anyone noticing and scooping up shares at a discount.

yes, if you have infinite money you could depress the price short term but people dont tend to burn money for fun. just like you could pump a stock short term if you wanted to- you still need to have buyers/sellers at the new price for it to have any impact"

I wrote a pretty long post on how that isnt how it works.

The further a stock falls from its actual value the more people are willing to buy it. 


>But as you said yourself but that people don't do it just to burn money for fun; that would be obvious as it's done for profit

not sure where you see a contraction here.

a short is a bet on the stock going down, obviously it's done for profit. in order for there to be profit the stock has to drop and drop a lot to offset the up front and continued cost associated with borrowing the share. So it has to drop pretty considerably from the point at which you sell short."
