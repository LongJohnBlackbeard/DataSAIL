2021-04-09 19:59:22,wallstreetbets,AAPL got me paid very nicely.  Back in the plus!  No complaints here!
2021-04-09 19:40:14,wallstreetbets,No puts on PLTR? Excellent
2021-04-09 19:54:54,wallstreetbets,The only thing hurting PLTR are insiders at this point.
2021-04-09 19:54:17,wallstreetbets,Lucky number 7
2021-04-09 19:49:52,wallstreetbets,what does this mean?
2021-04-09 19:55:45,wallstreetbets,"PLTR, you are cleared for liftoff."
2021-04-09 19:55:56,wallstreetbets,Like 1700+ so not a huge amount

2021-04-09 19:12:40,wallstreetbets,Fawk I was just looking at that earlier today and didn’t move on it
2021-04-09 19:57:44,wallstreetbets,"I think it’s more of an overreaction to their earnings call. Perhaps since so many ppl were afraid of the outcome they oversold. Since everything that goes down must go up, I took advantage of the sell off. Not financial advice tho, I’m just a fellow ape."
2021-04-09 19:57:19,wallstreetbets,Pay closer attention.
2021-04-09 19:17:54,wallstreetbets,As did I. Should have could have.
2021-04-09 19:25:06,wallstreetbets,Man the GME shit fucked me up.. I forgot 13% in 1 month is really fkn good
2021-04-09 18:22:10,wallstreetbets,"You can't take for granted that the Intel GPU will compete with a 3080 and a 6800, even if the raw power was there, massive software support is required.
20B is small compared to TSMC and Samsung investments.
With server Ice Lake I agree, may not beat Zen 3 but it is a step in the right direction, as they finally seem to be pushing up with the 10nm node.
But anyway, the P/E is really low and hard to pass, but got burned with them last year so I will keep looking from outside, it is not about being a boomer stock but how people actually think of it."
2021-04-09 18:03:54,wallstreetbets,"I hear you - but I’ll be bullish on INTC when it starts to make a competitive product again.

2021-04-09 19:18:48,wallstreetbets,"Given that GM is there - looks like they are mostly interested in the shortage for car manufacturers. 

And that problem is on the car manufacturers. They had a bad forecast of how many CPUs they was gonna need in their cars. So they order too few chips. The FABs got other customers. So now they are crying because they can't increase their orders. But the truth is that a FAB is expensive and you can't increase production. 

JIT (just-in-time) car production only works if parts you need can be ordered on a short notice.  Semiconductors has a very long order time."
2021-04-09 19:42:12,wallstreetbets,"The reason they are not invited because they primarily design companies, and this includes their chips. In a sense, in the eyes of America, they are a Taiwanese problem, not an American problem. Intel, on the other hand, insists on producing its chips themselves and be really really shit at it for a really really long time, they need help so they are there."
2021-04-09 18:26:02,wallstreetbets,"I'm very bullish on INTC, but I took profits when it hit 65 and I think you should take profits too.

[Just look at the price history for INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&ty=c&ta=0&p=w).  Whenever there's bad news the stock drops like $10-15.  Last October, last July, the coronavirus sell-off, the March before that, the market loves to overreact to bad news.

What the street doesn't seem to get is that there *has* to be bad news for INTC to trade at the multiples it trades at.  It's a *semiconductor company* with a PE that bounces between single digits and the low teens.  So when some news story hits about how INTC sucks, they forget that those negatives are pretty much already priced in, and people who are paying attention get a nice fat discount.

The stock is a rollercoaster.  I think the best play is to take profits now and wait for the market to panic over some new thing before buying in again."
2021-04-09 19:33:16,wallstreetbets,"idk.....Intel is another inflated company because of covid.

In my eyes intels future is unknown.  I doubt they will disappear.  But, I think it will be awhile before the get noticeable gains.

The last thing I heard about intel is they were going to start manufacturing chips for other people? if I understood that right.  Which I think would actually hurt there business.  I mean wouldn't that in itself cannibalize intels own CPU market by introducing other competitors.

But,  I do not know if any gains from intel should be proof of anything.  You could almost through a stone in Wallstreet right now and find a stock that gained 5 percent.

But, I will admit intel is trending up.

\*\*NOTE\*\* I am not telling anyone what to do with there money.  Do you own DD.  I am just posting my thoughts on the matter."

2021-04-09 18:24:39,wallstreetbets,Software support for gpu is trivial for a company like Intel
2021-04-09 19:07:21,wallstreetbets,"I agree, AMD is making a vastly superior product. There's a chip shortage now, maybe Intel can still make their shitty chips longer than AMD can make their awesome ones, but when the shortage is over, Intel is still having major issues producing chips using 7nm transistor technology. Last I checked they take twice as much power as what AMD is producing. That's a huge problem.

My Ryzen 3900x eats Intel for breakfast.

Edit: Just did some quick research, not sure what their Temps and power consumption look like, but AMD has been using 7nm transistors since 2019, Intel is releasing theirs in 2023 if they manage to stay on schedule. What happens when AMD is on 5nm? Intel is not the play right now. Maybe when they were oversold, but they are a long term short for me right now if I had any position in them.

Also I'm pretty sure Apple dropped them from their MacBook and is making their own chips now.

Edit 2: Read a Wikipedia article about transistors, these names are misleading, seems a lot more complex than transistor size. Will do more research and become less retarded."
2021-04-09 18:05:36,wallstreetbets,"ah yes, AMD has them so fucked with competitive products you can't even buy."
2021-04-09 18:21:50,wallstreetbets,I got both but so far Intel is doing better :/
2021-04-09 18:09:49,wallstreetbets,"all the technicals AND fundamentals are pointing in the right direction, once it breaks ATH of $69 people will start waking up"
2021-04-09 19:52:05,wallstreetbets,So close 😂
2021-04-09 18:33:42,wallstreetbets,"Yes, technical trend is strong, but I believe that there so much negative public sentiment in Intel rn that it's already undervalued. Positive price movement with negative public sentiment is a huge bull flag in my book."
2021-04-09 18:51:26,wallstreetbets,The more you know 🌈
2021-04-09 18:30:32,wallstreetbets,How do you have market access on Saturdays?
2021-04-09 19:26:48,wallstreetbets,"Wasn't their big GPU confirmed to be 3070 competitor? Also there's more to it than power lol, we've no idea about things like wattage and efficiency, also they're not manufacturing the card under their fabs, so whatever production capacity they purchased early on they're stuck with.

I've never commented here, but it really feels like you don't know much about this stuff? Like everything you pointed out was obvious, but also over blown.

Intel is making the manufacturing department a separate entity here, them spending money on a plant doesn't mean they get ' cutting edge chips '. Far from it actually.

A few decisions doesn't suddenly give the company lagging behind in some aspects a sudden winners edge?

Why don't you mention the threat of ARM when it comes to the mobile/laptop market?

It really reads like you skimmed some type of internet advertisement and just went with it?"
2021-04-09 19:27:01,wallstreetbets,"Node numbers don't matter as much as media talks about them. These are not even the gate width numbers across all transistors. Each chip has different set of transistors and not a will be on the same process.
No doubt TSMC process is doing wonders for its customers right now. But Intel will be on 7nm in 2023 and AMD will use 5nm TSMC then and hence AMD wins is a wrong argument.
Current Intel 10nm has a 10% higher transistor density than TSMC 7nm. It's a lot about process maturity, yeild and packaging."
2021-04-09 19:31:38,wallstreetbets,"Intels 10nm is comparable to TSMCs 7nm.
Those are just names and have nothing to do with the actual structure sizes. In fact the structure sizes are only a small part of a node (eg. Intels 14nm++++ is better than intels 14nm process even if its the same structure size).
TSMC or Samsung wouldn't have made a ++++ node instead they decrease the number e.g Samsung 8nm (as used for RTX30XX) is only an optimisation of their 10nm process."
2021-04-09 18:09:20,wallstreetbets,"Can’t buy Intel’s inferior product either, even at the higher price point for less performance. They’re all affected in the same way.

TSM and GoFlo will be there. AMD doesn’t have to be there to be covered."
2021-04-09 18:58:50,wallstreetbets,Argument I always make is AMD's product their engineering achievement or is it really tsmc's node carrying the load.
2021-04-09 19:29:03,wallstreetbets,AMD has increased their production capacity for the CPU's the past few weeks. Some of those CPU's are permanently on shelves now.

2021-04-09 18:31:05,wallstreetbets,Homie fast with the reply. Yea forgot it was Friday lol
2021-04-09 19:30:20,wallstreetbets,"If they can't use a smaller transistor over time they will definitely have worse performance. It is not an argument about optimizing the current technology, but the ability to grow into future technology, and they are struggling.

Edit: A quick Wikipedia read shows I'm retarded. Seems a lot more complicated than transistor size since the name of the transistor is basically meaningless."
2021-04-09 19:42:04,wallstreetbets,"A quick Wikipedia read showed me how retarded I am. Thank you, I will do more research."

And generally outperforms AMD on a number of tests at lower price points. dyr before you type."
2021-04-09 19:22:23,wallstreetbets,Is the Apple M1 really that powerefficient or is TSMCs 5nm carrying the load?

2021-04-09 19:01:07,wallstreetbets,$69 to $420
2021-04-09 18:56:54,wallstreetbets,69 is the way 🙌💎🚀🚀
2021-04-09 19:35:28,wallstreetbets,"I fully agree if Intel stays on 10nm or whatever they want to call it they will be worthless soon. (I would then expect them to go fabless though)
I disagree they are struggling. They announced last year their 7nm plans had slipped to 2023. The recent event they did about doubling down on production and foundary as a service they updated saying it is on track for that which is good. Their product roadmap for 2023 looks good. They now need to execute and put a product out on the schedule they have mentioned.
At that time if they are competing against a TSMC 5nm, they will win the process technology war just based on how Intel sizes and packs the chips."
2021-04-09 18:24:06,wallstreetbets,...AMD is an American company.

2021-04-09 19:44:24,wallstreetbets,"AMD switched to fabless, their foundaries were failing (similar to Intel's inability to move smaller than 14nm) and were spun off to create Global Foundaries.

Are you serious?? Just compare the Tomshardware review you linked with what Userbenchmark says about 5900x vs 11900k
You must be out of your mind to defend Userbenchmark"
2021-04-09 19:50:52,wallstreetbets,Intel still having in-house capabilities is huge especially with the demand for fabs continuingly to exponentially increase in the foreseeable future imo. We'll see how it plays out. I got money on all the companies anyways since I believe semiconductors in general are going to see big gains.
2021-04-09 18:45:18,wallstreetbets,"i don't deny the 11900k is not competitive, but there's plenty of other reasons why intel is worth more. stock is priced at current value, not for future value, which makes it a good buy for me."

2021-04-09 19:53:14,wallstreetbets,The rush of buying them knowing you're 100% about to fuck the market is fun.  Watching it bleed a slow painful death isnt.  But buying them outweighs the suffering cause i continue to buy them.

2021-04-09 17:57:54,wallstreetbets,The 3k limit is for ordinary taxable gains like income. Since he only lost capital gains he just won't get taxed on it.

2021-04-09 17:41:43,wallstreetbets,Yes the hedge funds are very focused on this guys 4k in calls

Edit: Definitely should have sold to buy longer calls after a few days when it didn’t recover for shit while much of the market was back up."

2021-04-09 17:26:11,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-04-09 17:13:43,wallstreetbets,You could reinvest it into something with steady dividend and low volatility. You will make money and still know it’s there to pay down your mortgage. If being debt free is more important than making more money than that perfectly ok. Just thinking that you are probably paying less interest on the mortgage than you can make from dividends
2021-04-09 17:42:05,wallstreetbets, Congratulations .. and fuck you
2021-04-09 17:48:39,wallstreetbets,Fucking A right good deal

2021-04-09 18:22:37,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn’t sell. The stock is only starting to take off, it has $50 potential"
2021-04-09 19:36:58,wallstreetbets,A degenerative gambler that takes profit and pays off debt. Damn. Grats on being debt free!

2021-04-09 19:48:37,wallstreetbets,Nice stacks mother fucker
2021-04-09 17:10:42,wallstreetbets,Thank you very much!
2021-04-09 18:48:28,wallstreetbets,I averaged down when it hit $20. Now I sell covered calls at my cost basis unit it actually hits it
2021-04-09 19:29:09,wallstreetbets,Bought calls for 1.5 ish. Sold them for 3 ish.
2021-04-09 18:24:28,wallstreetbets,You're not alone
2021-04-09 18:31:44,wallstreetbets,They're not clear. The call details are at the very end. Quite the shitty brokerage indeed
2021-04-09 18:40:31,wallstreetbets,You shouldn’t be trading options if you don’t understand this..... look at the premium buy and sell
2021-04-09 18:31:43,wallstreetbets,"Sir none of us live in a house, we just have triple mortgages on our cars."
2021-04-09 18:12:16,wallstreetbets,Life is expensive.  Options account had one purpose- to pay off the house.  It wasn't usable money.  It paid off the house and now my expenses go way down.
2021-04-09 19:12:23,wallstreetbets,I have a different mentality than most people.  Options were for making enough money to pay off house.  It happened.  Jobs were used for providing for family.  The two are separate.
2021-04-09 17:46:32,wallstreetbets,Because now he can gamble his mortgage payment on options and not be homeless.
2021-04-09 17:47:54,wallstreetbets,"ROI Peace of Mind > ROI Index Funds

2021-04-09 19:41:32,wallstreetbets,"FUBO is the one underlying I'm not allowed to trade anymore. And CRSR, of course."
2021-04-09 17:38:42,wallstreetbets,Completely understand this thought process.  Peace of mind is more important to us at this point.  Always money to be made in the markets.
2021-04-09 18:08:33,wallstreetbets,"Midwest but it is the remainder of the mortgage.  House is worth much more than that.  With the gain and money I have, house is paid off and I still have some money to keep option trading."
2021-04-09 19:45:30,wallstreetbets,"House aren't always expensive. Gotta live within your means. Some people like nice car > nice house. Some vice versa. There's a lot of homes in the 130 range, which is where my budget falls in. Getting new to trading and still learning before I start doing anything crazy, but always live within your means."
2021-04-09 19:32:34,wallstreetbets,"Buy at $1. Sell at $3. Multiply $2 gain by ~85,000.  (All approximate to simplify)"
2021-04-09 18:48:44,wallstreetbets,"Fuck you very much, have a nice day"
2021-04-09 18:45:40,wallstreetbets,"Congrats! You're too smart for this sub. 

I jumped in last week, sold to close a few calls today, but I'm holding the rest for next week's action."
2021-04-09 18:57:50,wallstreetbets,I guess the price he paid is 1.01 for the 23c? And the sell price is 2.56?
2021-04-09 18:40:50,wallstreetbets,Tastyworks is one of the best brokers
2021-04-09 18:58:27,wallstreetbets,"Welcome to Costco, I love you."
2021-04-09 19:03:32,wallstreetbets,you could say..... he's playing with house money now
2021-04-09 19:47:39,wallstreetbets,Plus not having to work 2 jobs. I mean unless you're bored all the time there's no better feeling than getting your free time back for some quality R&R
2021-04-09 18:51:14,wallstreetbets,There's something to be said for knowing you'll always have a roof (notwithstanding your shitty health care system). The world is just a little lighter. Well done.
2021-04-09 19:32:23,wallstreetbets,Not on the interface or margin interest side.
2021-04-09 19:00:53,wallstreetbets,Thanks I’ll make sticky to the breasts in your profile later!
2021-04-09 19:35:31,wallstreetbets,Main issue with Tasty is the dog shit chart... they couldn’t make a worse one if they tried. Other than that the option chain is nice and simple. I use ToS for charts

/s"
2021-04-09 17:10:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes. That’s one of the reasons the stock jumped from $20 per share to $420 per share, and then almost did the same thing again.

Do you remember when that happened?"
2021-04-09 17:49:03,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, then crashed from 350$ -50% for no fucking reason whatsoever.

But wait, hundreds millions of dollars in FTDs in March, DTCC proposing new rules that would limit hiding short positions in options (DTC-2021-005), media attacks saying ""Ignore GME short squeeze"" (seriously, why do they give a fuck if it's retail fighting retail?), K-10 filing by GME saying that short float exceeds the number of shares available to trade and that it might be a subject to short squeeze, shorts being unable or difficult to borrow while only having 1% borrowing fee at most - yep, shorts covered, nothing to see here."
2021-04-09 17:33:03,wallstreetbets,"If $420  was the ""high"", why is it still in the news?"
2021-04-09 17:30:05,wallstreetbets,"Of course he doesn’t. He jumped into the stock market for the first time afterward with the rest of the fucking apes

GameStop can’t go down. He hasn’t made money yet"

2021-04-09 17:51:28,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the timeline of your post history, when you transitioned from being a mobile phone game enthusiast to a stock market expert. Right around when GME peaked. Nice. What did you buy your shares at?

Very impressive."
2021-04-09 18:27:34,wallstreetbets,"Hey... can you do me a favor I have no memory so can you go look at the price action leading up to when “they” crashed the stock from $350? If it was manipulation that means the stock must have been on a slow and steady upwards trajectory right?

Fucking clowns."
2021-04-09 17:34:48,wallstreetbets,"I can’t believe they made a documentary about Enron *two whole years* after the company left the stock market.

Still waiting on the Behr Stearns, short squeeze, personally.

It couldn’t be because it’s still an interesting story that brings readers to the website."
2021-04-09 17:33:00,wallstreetbets,"I feel a certain sense of schadenfreude whenever I read someone’s profile or their comments and they list things like “I’ve owned GME since January 28th”

like that is not an achievement, it’s about 20 days away (in either direction) from having been a smart decision to buy it then lol."
2021-04-09 19:26:25,wallstreetbets,10K but whatever! Good bot
2021-04-09 18:00:47,wallstreetbets,"Yep, such an expected answer that has nothing to do with my original comment - instead of arguing my points you are trying to discredit me by looking at my other comments I made that are not relevant to this topic at all.

Avg. open at around 20$, my position is up about 600% rn, anything else?

Waiting for your highly educative response to the points I made, clearly you know more than me, thank you!"
2021-04-09 18:49:06,wallstreetbets,"Crashing down with 6 or 7 back to back circuit breakers was definitely manipulation, you'd have to be an absolute mongoloid of a retard to ignore that."
2021-04-09 18:31:39,wallstreetbets,you’re gonna lose some karma for that one
2021-04-09 18:01:47,wallstreetbets,"damn, do you wish you had set a stop loss when the stock was above $400 per share?"
2021-04-09 19:55:10,wallstreetbets,"It crashed hard so of course it triggered circuit breakers, that's what they do, why is that sketchy?

Edit: Do you motherfuckers not even know what circuit breakers are?"
2021-04-09 18:55:59,wallstreetbets,"Right but being up *30%* in a few hours after being up over 100% over a few days was totally normal. That’s my problem with you clowns. When a hedge fund whale comes in and buys calls and squeezes the stock you all think you’re genius traders. Then a hedge fund whale comes in and buys puts and you’re crying “mAniPulatIon.” It’s a whale’s game, if you don’t like it, leave. Don’t fucking whine about it.

And btw the circuit breakers *break* the fall."
2021-04-09 18:32:47,wallstreetbets,Worth it. I’m not sure what the opposite of karma farming is but that’s what I do.
2021-04-09 18:05:46,wallstreetbets,"I'm in long, I couldn't care less if GME squeezes or not. But I'm still waiting for that response of yours, I'm sure you can explain all those points I made. It's not like you are trying to misdirect the topic cause you don't have anything to say. How unexpected, wow."

If the verdict is not guilty and you would consider that to cause nationwide violence, you can buy moments after the verdict and hope for large scale civil unrest.

2021-04-09 19:37:33,wallstreetbets,I got 300 4/16 27c... have been holding for a while. Managed to average down to about 48 per contact. Really hope I can at least break even next week. Ready for theta to destroy these calls unless we happen to open at 26 on monday lol
2021-04-09 17:06:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m smooth brain ape. Because I still don’t fully understand what happened here.
2021-04-09 17:46:18,wallstreetbets,"I sold some 04/16 27 covered calls yesterday at 0.13 while waiting all week for a nice spike like Monday to come back thinking i should open them to at least get some theta still.

Peaked today at 0.20. Very depressing. Had a waited a day I probably would have ended up opening some 28 or 29 calls. Now I have to hope we close under 27 next week.

I do have some 04/30 25c though (which i bought a week or so ago) which are now even and august 37ca that I wouldn't mind to see go in the green. Best case if i get excised we dip back down to 24 25 before end of april and I can pocket some profit.

Good luck to you sir, i hope those 04/16 27cs aren't mine!"

2021-04-09 17:28:22,wallstreetbets,Yep I got my 25 calls for 30 cents how about you? I bought 5 or 10 more today for 47 cents and averaged up a little.
2021-04-09 17:11:45,wallstreetbets,Had 39K in calls including 0 Day expiration calls. Banked 13K profit and now I have 52K in calls.
2021-04-09 18:32:35,wallstreetbets,Don't count on closing under 27 next week. Buy your calls back while they are still cheap and don't sell covered calls before a major catalyst. You want to sell the covered calls after the catalyst when they are expensive.
2021-04-09 18:37:50,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't be placing such a large bet If I didn't think PLTR wasn't going to easily skyrocket to 29 in less than 2 trading days. I know there's many resistance levels to get there but it will come out of no where like a tornado. We need to hit past 24.50 and 25.17 first.
2021-04-09 19:12:47,wallstreetbets,Nope too late is after we see more than 6% in a day. And hold.
2021-04-09 17:16:28,wallstreetbets,Im not here to lose sir. If we dip I will sell ITM calls and buy 10X OTM calls.
2021-04-09 17:32:53,wallstreetbets,"Have a group at $0.31 and scattered at higher prices, average is $0.45.

If I get lucky and the stock has a pullback for whatever/no reason on Monday-Wednesday combined with Theta decay on options, I’ll add significantly to my option weighting for 4/16. Likely a couple additional April weeklies as well in case this thing jumps after demo and then keeps moving. 
The R/R is already ridiculous, but if we get a drop next week, that’s a fukking golden ticket. 

Unfortunately I have considerations requiring some risk aversion currently.

Made my nut however on the first batch of options with $11 November calls bought in the $9.xx range LMAO."
2021-04-09 18:42:28,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I expected it might get close to 27 or even above, but hopefully not much. It's been rocky for a while now so even if it does spike up I'm hoping for a new bottom around 25.50 i can buy back in on later.

Basically use the calls for some swing plays and collect the premium. If it goes to 28 or 29 I'll survive, if its 30 or above i'll feel shitty. But if there's one thing I've learned opening calls you have to accept you may get excised if they go ITM. If you start buying things back you rarely win. Could roll them forward... we'll see!"
2021-04-09 19:25:42,wallstreetbets,Which calls are good  to grab I currently have a 27.5 4/30
2021-04-09 18:44:44,wallstreetbets,Rolling forward is an option because after the catalyst likely back down. Especially near earnings.

2021-04-09 19:52:42,wallstreetbets,Check out 4/21 VIX call OI and 4/30 SPY puts. Some pretty big numbers.
2021-04-09 17:45:06,wallstreetbets,Seems to me it’s peak time for offerings as well. Makes sense given the availability of money in the market
2021-04-09 16:53:18,wallstreetbets,"Citadel is waiting for the dollar to collapse and trying to trigger that to pay their bet to GME shareholders, I'd do that, why give 100 000 $, that's worth 100 000 $, when you can reduce your opposition to dirt, especially if your opposition has been your cash cow for ever and are catalyzing your doom. Someone has to come in and knock out Citadel so they don't drown the world, it would take the angle of saying that the free market was not treated as free by specific agglomerations of wealth, and that bully is only left to the referee. Really it's all quite sad, because there will be world war 3 before an American is a king on earth, that is not something that they can have, god would not allow it to exist in glory, and they need to grow up about it or we will never know about Rome again."

2021-04-09 18:27:29,wallstreetbets,Apple is 6% of spy which is entering the 5g cycle which most analysts agree will cause lots of consumers to upgrade phones and will see huge earnings coming up. Microsoft is another 5% of spy which has seen massive earnings growth and will most likely continue with an economic recovery which looks likely. Amazon is 4% of spy and has seen massive earnings growth which is likely to continue. Facebook and google are 6% of spy which had lower earnings due to less ad spending during covid which is likely to turn around coming out of the pandemic. Berkshire is another 1.5% of spy which is trading at a pe of 15. I think betting against these stocks is insane lol. Not to mention the absolute massive hoard of cash consumers are sitting on thanks to free biden bucks and Donald dollars. Tesla sure that stock is overvalued but most of spy is fairly reasonable and some sectors are undervalued. This looks like you are playing with fire and are about to burn your account lol. Good luck and Godspeed gaybear.

One. Melvin lost 53% in January 

Two. Mevlin gained 22% on the now 47% of December 2020 value 

Three. Melvin after losing 53% in January, gaining 22% in february; by march is somehow now at 51% loss 


Something tells me they continued to short GME in march.

2) What does it mean that they didn’t cover the shorts ?
3) How unprecedented is it for a HF to lose 49%
4) this totally explains why they have been shorting like crazy the last few days, why it happened the second half of the week (ending on a Friday, releasing this news on a Friday), and giving more evidence that the shorting is all artificial?"

January was the first chunk.  The last big price increase was the second chunk.  Now theyre sitting back, waiting for people to lose interest, slowly doing stuff to lower share price, then cover another chunk of shorts sometime in the coming weeks? Is that a possibility?  Play a long game and slowly cover?  Pick off shares here and there over time from those who get bored and sell off?  This is my chunk theory. Named after chunk."

This will be downvoted as FUD, but something doesn’t smell right. Why would Melvin Capital (MC) allow those articles about the Q1 losses see the light of day? What do they gain? I’m operating under the assumption that the MSM is beholden to the hedge funds and the big players.

It was clear why MC leaked their February gains. They had a reputation to repair. But what does MC gain by leaking the Q1 losses? Something isn’t adding up. These guys are scary smart and to think otherwise is unwise.

Is this a trap (cue Admiral Ackbar)?"

**Edit**:  Remember that anonymous journalist that made a post on WSB, when the ""Profit"" Melvin announcement was made, that stated it was all lies, and Plotkin had conspired with media to give a false narrative?
Shame that post was deleted by mods, as this is 100% proof that journalist was legit. The journo even wanted to give proof to the mods here. I have it saved somewhere. I'll find it.  (This was during the recent Mod issues when it got removed)

>**Melvin planted stories about their Feb performance**

>Hello apes, I'm a former reporter at Bloomberg. I cannot divulge my name, but ask me anything else and I will try to prove I'm not bullshitting.

>Anyway, today we saw Bloomberg, CNBC, and Reuters simultaneously blast glowing articles about how Plotkin made 20% in Feb. Every story came out at the same time and cited ""sources"" or ""people familiar with the matter,"" but barely had any other details. This is typical of story planted by PR.

>PRs will tell every reporter on the street ""hey I got a tip for you but don't publish until Wednesday after market."" And every reporter thinks they have an exclusive and types up the article. And then PR gets the most bang for the buck as every outlet publishes the same bullshit at the same time.

>I would know. I deal with Melvin's cunty COO David Kurd when I was reporting on them. This is his usual tactic.
Anyway, I don't know if they're lying about these gains. Probably not. Maybe they fudged some mark-to-market valuations to show a good month. But the bigger takeaways is that Melvin is desperate to improve their image. They are weak. We are strong. Fuck Plotkin and fuck Kurd. Let's keep digging into their positions.

2021-04-09 19:24:36,wallstreetbets,"Don't know if they were 'continuing' to short, but maybe covering more positions? We did see another massive run-up for GME in march

Edit: Their 'net' loss in March is around %20 then assuming the 22% is accurate. This is still significantly less than the Jan. loss. So likely fewer shorts were covered in March than in Jan, \*if this loss was from GME\*. I would guess if they still have any open short positions left at all in GME, it will take the price rising to above the March highs for them to cover."

2021-04-09 18:57:49,wallstreetbets,Account 71 days old? Created Jan 29 2021? Crazy what a coincidence
2021-04-09 19:08:47,wallstreetbets,"At the height of their losses, their portfolio was down to 47%, with 53% losses.

Assuming that Melvin didn’t lie at any point, this means that they covered between a range of $80-150 dollars.

**assuming that their regression of their February gains was due to GME**, then that means (bare minimum) they have less shares now than they did at that time period. 

Why? Because the price is higher now, but they’ve suffered less losses. 

I’ll play through the numbers and see if I can get some scenarios together that can put them in the proper price range, but I need to know if their posted losses extend to the day of release, or if they cut off earlier I.E. the end of March

But there’s three seperate scenarios that need to be checked:

1) Melvin Capital covered completely on 26 January at a loss of 53%

2) Melvin Capital covered partially on 26, 27, and 28 Jan to a loss of 53%

3) Melvin never covered

For scenario 1, then that means Melvin had reopened their short position during the sell off of GME

For scenario 2, results would be inconclusive because the price ranges spread too far

For scenario 3) that would mean that Melvin has likely closed some of his short positions, but would be inconclusive as articles referencing their 53% loss don’t pin it to a specific day.

I’ll try to play with the numbers over the weekend, and If I get something conclusive or significant, then I’ll create another DD post. I hadn’t updated my first one on recommendation from peers, in that I couldn’t attribute all Melvin’s losses to short shares as they may have been holding derivatives as well. Although,  I find  it unlikely due to the SI% and losses reported from other hedge funds"
2021-04-09 19:28:36,wallstreetbets,"you should multiply assuming e.g. the 22% only refers to february, so it has a new basis.

but then it would be 44.4% loss and not 49%

(1-0.51) \* (1+0.22) \* (1-0.07)  = (1-0.444)"

2021-04-09 18:50:29,wallstreetbets,"Negative. If you start with a million dollars and go down 53%, you have 470k. Now if you go up 22% you are at 573k (the 22% gain is on the reduced balance after the loss). You are still down 42% overall from your original million."

2021-04-09 17:59:28,wallstreetbets,"Fuck no it doesn’t track. We like to talk about gabe having to sell a boat or two, but the whole HF model is based on sharing in 20% of the gains, not the losses.  They’re not losing their own money folks."
2021-04-09 18:10:08,wallstreetbets,"It's not getting ignored. Once people realize the scam, and that's what hedge fund managed retirement funds are, then society will move away from the model.

Hedge funds should not under any circumstances even be able to destroy retirements and walk away like that. Yet, they are as you have pointed out. Just because some rich Kodak pricks lobbied congress for a tax loophole in the 70s."

2021-04-09 18:02:17,wallstreetbets,"Random example. Tech pretty much died in Q1 and only just recovered this past week to what they were earlier in the quarter. Anyone heavy in tech would've been down in Q1. Not 49% down, but down."
2021-04-09 17:59:38,wallstreetbets,"No- these articles are known for reporting unrealized losses. For all you know all the shorts are open and they are sitting there in their brokerage account at -50% unclosed. 

Like if I own Tesla shares and the value goes 800 to 400 dolars. I haven't sold a thing but i have a paper ""50% loss"". Same can be true for shorts."

2021-04-09 16:46:00,wallstreetbets,"Definitely within risk management parameters. You have to understand that hedges funds don’t really risk manage “hard numbers”, just percentages. And it’s perfectly normal for some months for a hedge to be down even 10 or even 15% in really bad months. The important thing is that at the end of the year they at least “beat the market” (meaning, beating the SP500, aka +10% gains - most don’t beat the market, it’s REALLY hard to actually have +10% gains over the year).

What is very dangerous is for a hedge fund to be down 52% in a single month, that puts it close to an Archegos situation, although not quite. Melvin getting squeezed by GME was a close call for them, but it seems they managed to recover in the end (still heavy losses for the year and definitely not beating the SP500 unless they make some sick predictions the rest of the year lol, but not gonna implode like our friends in Archegos)"
2021-04-09 17:48:44,wallstreetbets,Well also it looks really bad if you don’t even put your own money in the fund.

2021-04-09 17:55:39,wallstreetbets,"Oh of course they made some gains... the gains were made on the post loss balance. So its like, lose 50% of 100%, gain 7% of your new 100% which is still 49% less than you had last week. Its like getting bullied out of half my lunch money and then selling a handful of my potato chips to make a slight ""gain""... I still lost."
2021-04-09 17:31:00,wallstreetbets,"That point doesn't really matter, people still think those reported gains are based on their original investment amount like the person I replied to and not what they actually had in their account."

2021-04-09 18:30:31,wallstreetbets,Lie about how much they have lost on their quarterly report?  I'm sure they can to an extent. They likely could use some creative  accounting. They wouldn't be able to fudge it much though or they risk more government agencies looking into them. I beleive they likely lost close to or slightly more than the 49%. I also belive they were never up the 22% Plotkin claimed earlier to congress. I also beleive they are going keep posting losses if they even make it to the end of Q2.

2021-04-09 18:15:02,wallstreetbets,">then society will move away from the model.

It's not a *model*, it's a mistake that certain states and municipalities made over the course of decades and now they're doing stupid, desperate things, like investing in hedge funds, in order to meet the promises they made.  

They'll inevitably fail and we'll have another disaster on our hands, but hopefully not for another 5 years or so.  We're memestonking now - one disaster at a time.

>Just because some rich Kodak pricks lobbied congress for a tax loophole in the 70s.

This is about public employee pensions - there really are no private sector pensions anymore, which has worked to the immense benefit of private sector workers.  When pensioners are hurt by hedge fund failures that will be the fault of the politicians and bureaucrats who created the problem, nobody else."

2021-04-09 18:28:54,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure hedgefunds use Mark to market accounting. They can't just not report an unrealized loss of 10B and say they had a realized gain of 2B which is 20% gain for the qtr or some shit.

Melvin started the quarter with $1 billion.

Melvin loses 65% due to shorting GME, now has $350 million.

CNBC tells us they gained 22% in February but that is based on the $350 million left in their account. Now has $427 million.

Melvin is still down ~57% from the start of the quarter when they had $1 billion."

What makes you say this? Private sector workers haven't really been doing that well over the last 30 years. There are more and more homeless people and people living in cars. Yes, some private sectors workers have made out very well over the last 30 years. The majority? We really shouldn't have to make all of these decisions to guarantee a retirement for ourselves. Doing it this way gives the good retirements to the financial sector who are ripping us all off."

When your employer matches your 401k contribution, that's generally the end of the employer's involvement.  That's *your* money.  

If you're relying on a pension, then you just have to hope like hell that the company or the pension management firm hasn't gone bankrupt by the time you need to start drawing benefits.  If they do go broke, you're fucked.

And when they stop matching, as many firms have done recently? When they don't even have 401k plans? Fewer than half of working americans even have 401ks.

>Oh God, it's so hard...can't somebody else just take care of me and tell me how much money I get?

>I don't think this is the sub for you.

I'm personally doing very well. I don't think this new system is good for society however. I think there is going to be a bunch more bankruptcies and homeless people in the near future when people are aged out of the pensions. Current and near future private sector retirees still have pensions. 

And forcing people into 401ks could be why we have had these insane returns of the last 30 years. The stock market, not social security or pensions, is the ultimate pyramid scheme."

I effectively opened up a call debit spread, but they are completely separate options in my Robinhood account.

Let’s just say Monday rolls around, SPY opens at like $415 and then for whatever reason the guy who bought my $413 call decides to exercise. I know it’s unlikely, but what happens?

Would Robinhood automatically execute my $412 call to cover the difference?

It actually has good fundamentals, high price targets (determined by math and not some random analyst opinion), and every day it seems some sort of WWE related meme is posted. It’s like the most obvious meme stock choice, yet it’s untouched. AEW competition could put people off...but I mean, we are sitting here investing in companies that were basically dead. WWE financials are good. The DD posted was good too. The nostalgia behind it is high. Just doesn’t make much sense to me since it seems so obvious. Also, I’m not asking to sway people to invest-genuinely curious why it’s not popular. Just seems to tick all the obvious boxes"

With BaaS, a NIO model 3 would only cost 20K.

He'll soon sell the cheapest EV's known to man to the hundreds of millions of Chinese, each of them will pay a monthly subscription fee on the batteries because they can't afford to pay the full price up front.  

Nio will be the most profitable EV maker in five years, and they'll have achieved this without needing to sell a single vehicle in North America.

Also in May, but after the May options expire I believe, will be the official notification of inclusion on the Russell index. It won't ACTUALLY be added until the end of June but the announcement will likely also provide a small bump. ETFs that track the index being forced to buy will likely only contribute a small bump in and of itself but every little bit helps."

2021-04-09 16:01:59,wallstreetbets,P/E is artificially inflated by debt payoff.    Look at the book value.     Check out the KHC bull thesis.    The best case scenario is a recession and this will run to $100 or higher.

2021-04-09 16:09:58,wallstreetbets,Do yourself a favor and sell that shit. Its not worth ruining your future and someone else's. Making them have to start over because you were meming around on reddit isn't cool.
2021-04-09 16:14:09,wallstreetbets,"No one is gonna commend you for doing something so selfish, particularly to the person you are supposed to be sharing your life with.  This movement was supposed to be about reasonable gambles on a really cool stock, not about actually throwing in all of your money and all of your wife's money (and yeah, it's her money too).  

I think the best thing for you to do is come clean, and apologize for this.  Maybe she'll think it's funny, or maybe she'll tell you to double down.  Maybe she'll divorce you and take half your GME.  Regardless, if you care about her, you should be honest and accept the consequences."

2021-04-09 17:09:43,wallstreetbets,"Even if if it moons before the divorce, imagine how mad she'll be at you taking that risk without her!"
2021-04-09 17:11:33,wallstreetbets,Sell it right now you’ve only lost $4k. Dumbass
2021-04-09 15:43:51,wallstreetbets,If this is true you’re actually a retarded ape 🦧
2021-04-09 17:15:58,wallstreetbets,"mods can we get a ban for this scumbag? spamming absolute trash, i feel bad for his wife."
2021-04-09 16:46:34,wallstreetbets,"Fuck you OP. Irresponsible dipshit.

Edit: Also fake & gay. OP probably isn't married just doing this for attention."
2021-04-09 17:26:12,wallstreetbets,You're a legit piece of shit.
2021-04-09 18:11:56,wallstreetbets,There’s nothing cool funny or hell yeah about this kind of shit at all.
2021-04-09 17:13:02,wallstreetbets,"$GME riders are metaphorically retarded. You're actually retarded. If you want to throw away your own money, that's one thing, but you shouldn't actively take unwilling or unwitting participants with you."
2021-04-09 18:06:58,wallstreetbets,"Idk. Just seems selfish. Unless all of that equity and the house was yours exclusively and in no way her contribution,  you just essentially stole from her.  

I'm dumb and desperate for enough money to quit my job, but I'm not even this dumb where I would take my fiance's money as my own and gamble it away."
2021-04-09 16:12:23,wallstreetbets,"Don’t be stupid dude. As great as it may be but you NEVER fuck with your house equity. Bad Ape!!

Wait till she finds out and trust me she will. Bookmark my comment so you know I am not kidding"

2021-04-09 18:15:30,wallstreetbets,I want to short your marriage is it possible?
2021-04-09 18:16:42,wallstreetbets,I hope you are kidding. You NEVER gamble with money you need to live with.
2021-04-09 18:37:17,wallstreetbets,Hope she has a rich boyfriend
2021-04-09 19:34:33,wallstreetbets,I’ve never seen someone so retarded and I don’t even mean this as a joke
2021-04-09 16:39:00,wallstreetbets,"Dibs on this guy’s wife! 

No seriously OP, take the money out again and only leave a small portion. Your relationships should matter more than a potential gain."
2021-04-09 16:02:02,wallstreetbets,"What a bad investment, why not make a good investment instead? Waste of 100k"
2021-04-09 16:34:14,wallstreetbets,"Are you retarded or just a fucking asshole?

Dude, I don’t mind loss porn from some retarded motherfuckers who gamble their life savings because it’s just them and their choice, it’s entertaining.

This is YOUR FUCKING FUTURE HOUSE that your wife was probably very excited to finally go to.

On a stock which DEFINITELY go down to 30 dollars or less, lol. Not even a good stock.

What the fuck is wrong with you? It just triggers me off so much for some reason, to be such a retarded egoistical asshole. Fuck you. (I think it’s the selfishness part, I hate selfish people)"
2021-04-09 18:53:45,wallstreetbets,You’re 100% cappin’ for fake internet points. Nobody is this much of a sack of garbage

2021-04-09 19:23:48,wallstreetbets,"Reminds me of the scene from The Avengers: Infinity War where Thanos has to give up whats most precious to him.. aka Gamora to get the Soul Stone.

2021-04-09 15:41:08,wallstreetbets,Homeless shelter for sure...
2021-04-09 18:01:39,wallstreetbets,....and this is why we don’t take financial advice from the internet ....maybe some good divorce advice to come as well?

2021-04-09 17:10:05,wallstreetbets,"Good luck, king, but I hope you lose everything."
2021-04-09 18:19:10,wallstreetbets,"I sure hope this isn't real. Even if you win, it's a super bad sign for your relationship."
2021-04-09 18:24:11,wallstreetbets,Idiot. Don't invest money you cannot afford to lose.
2021-04-09 18:29:15,wallstreetbets,She gonna beat ur ass

2021-04-09 17:54:37,wallstreetbets,"I sure hope it works out for you, but also if your story is true (and all the other ""don't tell the wife but I've invested everything"") you're kind of a piece of shit on your way to rightfully losing your family.  But you know... to each his own."

2021-04-09 15:48:28,wallstreetbets, I’m here for some degenerate gambling but these ‘didn’t tell the wife I lost tens of thousands of dollars of *our* money’ posts are just trashy.
2021-04-09 15:41:25,wallstreetbets,Greed is good

2021-04-09 16:09:11,wallstreetbets,"this, blows my mind out of all the possibilities out there people are still dumping into this shitshow of a slowmoving train derailment. i hate how the gme bullshit has ruined WSB so much"

2021-04-09 18:35:08,wallstreetbets,do you actually think that GME gang represents everyone invested in GME? Just because you guys are buying doesn't mean the rest of the market is
2021-04-09 19:37:49,wallstreetbets,But the squeeze is a lock though. Right?  Right?

2021-04-09 17:40:20,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-09 18:38:35,wallstreetbets,Honestly.  I wonder if she’ll get angrier if he blows his money on GameStop instead of blow and hookers.
2021-04-09 19:27:01,wallstreetbets,And her boyfriends’!
2021-04-09 19:58:18,wallstreetbets,"I have had 7 stocks go bankrupt over the 35 years I have been investing, losing over 90% of their value.  Of course this may only prove I am an idiot and shit at picking stocks, but it suggests your theory may be wrong."

2021-04-09 18:52:04,wallstreetbets,The price of $PSSY is about to bounce off the fucking moon.

2021-04-09 19:03:29,wallstreetbets,Yea I mean this thing is 100% squeezing to the moon 🚀🚀🚀 or so I thought?
2021-04-09 17:19:25,wallstreetbets,Or OP made up the wife hoping for retard karma
2021-04-09 17:16:21,wallstreetbets,Agreed. But she should know what comes along with marrying an autist.
2021-04-09 18:28:48,wallstreetbets,"Yep what an ass, op needs to discuss with wife before yoloing their home. Maybe it moons this month... Maybe next year. Nobody knows when shorts will cover"
2021-04-09 18:57:36,wallstreetbets,"Oh look. Found the people new to wsb

2021-04-09 16:18:53,wallstreetbets,Lmao that’s facts.
2021-04-09 17:54:21,wallstreetbets,Not possible
2021-04-09 17:30:13,wallstreetbets,Fuckin funny comment!
2021-04-09 18:56:50,wallstreetbets,If hes willing to lose her opening a life insurance policy and offing her would be more efficient than this pissing away of money.
2021-04-09 17:48:02,wallstreetbets,No way she can be mad if they stop looking for their fixer upper house and find a dream home with the mew fortune
2021-04-09 19:01:07,wallstreetbets,"Hey all you folks who are new to wallstreetbets. 

You see how these two losers who are being lame ass Debbie Downers?

This is an example of how not to be in this sub. Actually it’s a perfect example. These two fucking losers are the antithesis of this subs culture."
2021-04-09 16:51:47,wallstreetbets,I just don't want to see people hurt themselves. Every dollar I can AFFORD to lose is tied up in GME. People take the meme way too far by gambling away things they should not be playing with.
2021-04-09 17:08:15,wallstreetbets,I just hope this works for y’all.
2021-04-09 17:20:20,wallstreetbets,Actually feel like a retard after reading this
2021-04-09 18:23:41,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations, you've made me feel like a fucking moron reading this post."
2021-04-09 16:07:18,wallstreetbets,Very trashy. At least she will have a good excuse to finally split and marry the bf.
2021-04-09 16:16:32,wallstreetbets,"Reminds me of the Boomers' ""i hate my wife"" humor. Its just not that funny anymore."
2021-04-09 16:27:57,wallstreetbets,"Trashy, selfish, narcissistic, immature, and absolutely foolish is what posts like these are.  What an absolute imbecile the OP is."
2021-04-09 15:56:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes, thats not good. In the end, everyone should be aware  that its a risk.
You should only invest what you can afford to Lose and maybe some more, if you know its realistic, that you can Cover it in a good amount of time. Max 1-2 years. Without ending homeless of course.
I hope you got what i mean.
My opinion."

2021-04-09 18:41:00,wallstreetbets,True. From some posts I’ve seen and my circle of friend who are invested. They all bought. Doesn’t mean everyone bought. But I do know most people in GME gang didn’t sell.
2021-04-09 19:43:55,wallstreetbets,This is most definitely the way
2021-04-09 19:20:06,wallstreetbets,At least you can share blow and hookers.
2021-04-09 19:26:55,wallstreetbets,OP is the most WSB thing I have seen in a bit. 😶

2021-04-09 18:57:11,wallstreetbets,With that combination you’re either fucking the gourd or getting fucked by the gourd and that’s just life.

2021-04-09 19:50:09,wallstreetbets,I wish I had a shitty free reddit award to give you for this comment.

2021-04-09 19:19:21,wallstreetbets,"There's a few types of degeneracy, and the guy in this post did something literally shitty. What real difference is there between calling OP shitty for using their home equity proceeds versus calling him a retard for blowing it on a stock that has a real chance of not going anywhere at this point? OP didn't even buy options. It's shares. You didn't bitch about THAT not fitting the CuLtUrE though."

But it was 80,000 fucking dollars and not $17 so it’s a start. 

But people still bought shares in this sub before January and they were called pussies for doing it. 

No fucking way a comment calling him a jerk for spending his marriages equity on a risk would have received 40 upvotes before January. We would have all laughed and made fun of him and the fucking nerds who took it seriously would have been roasted even harder."

2021-04-09 16:22:46,wallstreetbets,"Disruptive technologies are fantastic.

But a word of caution.

Speaking as someone who went to school for power engineering I caution anyone to beware of any company promising to decentraize power generation. We're used to the concept in information technology but the physics is fundamentally different here.

Energy production and transmission is all about optimizing around energy loss, whether that is within the generator plants or the losses incurred in power lines. Specifically take note of energy loss in transmission. There's a very good reason we employ centralized stations with huge high voltage AC lines to deliver power. It's all about mitigating loss.

When you decentralize the losses incurred in transmission is a nightmare, especially when your talking about relatively tiny DC systems. You literally can't push low voltage DC any appreciable distance without losing it to line loss. That's why we dump 500k volt AC into the mainline for long distance which steps down to your 50k-12k city lines. It's just physics.

So the idea of thousands of tiny power plants pushing energy around just makes incredibly wary, because nobody can change physics. And this isn't even mentioning the ridiculous inefficiency you get from separating a major powerplant into a hundred tiny sources with localized storage. It's like shooting yourself in the foot to try to run faster.

You don't have to take my word for it, but I encourage you to research just basic energy generation and transmission principles as they relate to efficiency and loss with regards to scale. Especially before throwing money at it"

2021-04-09 16:29:58,wallstreetbets,I just initiated my transfer so go ahead and buy some calls
2021-04-09 19:05:58,wallstreetbets,"No you're not stuck.  Start moving half, and when they transfer move the rest."

2021-04-09 17:01:51,wallstreetbets,It was $115 last week and spiked back to $180 in less than a day. You said the exact same thing then!
2021-04-09 15:45:47,wallstreetbets,I can’t understand at this point how some bit of logic doesn’t makes sense to gme apes.  You aren’t buying a dip. Your putting money into a sinking ship. Downvote me all you want
2021-04-09 17:43:31,wallstreetbets,Did you even look at the picture or did you smooth brain it and just post randomly?
2021-04-09 17:22:17,wallstreetbets,"Oof, good luck. Gamestop is legally allowed to recommend a share recall starting tomorrow (60 days before the June 9 meeting), so it's now possible for the squeeze to start any day."

2021-04-09 15:04:32,wallstreetbets,Well those who think this price will go “Bananas” and are also holding in robinhood where they have legitimate reason to suspect they will be screwed in any further squeezes...... those are called retards and they belong here.
2021-04-09 17:13:17,wallstreetbets,60% gain? Totally a sinking ship lol.
2021-04-09 17:39:22,wallstreetbets,"You mean it crashed to $110 and then recovered, only to continue its downward trend. Agreed?"
2021-04-09 15:54:13,wallstreetbets,They cannot see that their investment thesis is QAnon level conspiracy theory.  It's sad.
2021-04-09 17:28:36,wallstreetbets,"I already have some more shares in fidelity so I won’t totally miss it if it happens. But yeah, I totally expect to be the catalyst with my luck."
2021-04-09 15:10:58,wallstreetbets,And sadly there’s an abundance of them
2021-04-09 16:05:25,wallstreetbets,Nah. My investment thesis is in selling CCs with ridiculous premiums. The extra cash flow pays for itself.
2021-04-09 16:10:50,wallstreetbets,BUT the hedges! The hedgers...the hedgie...

2021-04-09 16:10:00,wallstreetbets,Atleast this makes some sense. I’d imagine the premiums are good.  So you don’t think it’s spiking would be my guess.
2021-04-09 16:22:01,wallstreetbets,I’m ITM either way so I don’t really care. Got a few extra shares outside of these 200 that I can capitalize on in case it does spike.
2021-04-09 16:23:50,wallstreetbets,Your shares won’t be ITM come next week.  Just sayin

Stonks, don’t drop, Vlad shuts ‘em down, on robinhoods shop
Oh, no, that's how WSB apes roll


Vlad wanna try, vlad wanna lie

Wsb apes the wildest
My apes is with it, you want it come and get it
Took the tendies and we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when GME run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew
Don't know what our wives  goin' through
I'ma have to show apes how easily vlad blows apes
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light Vlad up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you

Think you holdin' Vlad by the grapes? 
Then you haven't met the apes

Stonks, don’t drop, Vlad shuts ‘em down, on robinhoods shop
Oh, no, that's how WSB apes roll

Stonks, don’t drop, Vlad shuts ‘em down, on robinhoods shop

Stop actin' like a baby—mind your business, lady!
Nosy boomers get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how apes get down
Watch my apes spit rounds
Oh, you think stonks funny?
Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry (grabs tendies)

Stonks, don’t drop, Vlad shuts ‘em down, on shop

2021-04-09 19:52:07,wallstreetbets,"There will be a day in the future where we will all look back at this drama and fucking realize how great it was to endure and persevere through GME's crazy peaks and valleys together.  I've been holding my 4 shares @ 190 since January (I know, I'm poor) and man has it been a fucking ride not wanting to sell.

We've learned SO much about the markets, institutions and regulations for GME but for me, by far the most important thing I have learned so far was the fucked up illusion of integrity the markets have.

If you think for one second we live in a free market system, **you are VERY wrong.**  There is this notion that a non free-market system means little to no government intervention within trading and markets yet complete neglects the intervention and constraint those with wealth and power have outside of government.  Those with wealth and power have the ability to manipulate not just the markets, but mass media and government itself as well.  They do so anonymously and over time in effect, become the ""invisible hand"" talked about by Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments.

Of all the great things these people could do serving as the ""invisible hand"" with their wealth, power and authority, they've elected to serve themselves and only themselves while profiting off the backs of their OWN PEOPLE let alone the rest of the world.  They've chosen to destroy rather than create and among the many things they've destroyed, it was the notion that integrity within the markets is a feasible concept.

They have the capital and power the common individual does NOT.  They have the power have to lower prices to the ground through shorting and naked short positions and it's only a matter of time before it comes to light on how many companies they've destroyed through tact like seen with GME.

If there is anything I've taken from this, it's that a free-market system without government intervention is a ploy.  **There will never be a free market system, government or not.**"

That has sooooooo much potential to be absolutely great and something is just off about it making it “meh”. 

I love the premise, the cast, the soundtrack, a lot of the details,, but I don’t know what’s wrong with it. Maybe it needed a more skilled director or writer or something."

Ask yourself this. You keep seeing all these ""bought the dip"" affirmations. You seen any ""it's rocketing so I got on"" posts like you did in January? No, of course not. The only people who think $160 is low are *new* buyers, and you're running out of them.

I'll buy in again at 35. And it'll get there, since now that it's 160, nobody's going to buy at 190 or higher."

2021-04-09 15:42:11,wallstreetbets,"Not to be a grammar nazi, but the literal translation of Stück is „piece“; like in a piece of cake, not „share“.

It just says they have X amount of shares. In English, you‘d probably say „[number] shares“. 

Shares in german is „Aktien“, or „Aktie“ for a single share, not Stück. ;-)"

Aktie sounds odd for a dutchie, we say aandeel , then again we where the first to introduce the concept with $VOC

2021-04-09 16:36:39,wallstreetbets,"well, while most of the imperial system is retarded and doesn't make sense, the american comma and period in numbers actually make sense.

commas denote a pause, periods denote a stronger separation. In numbers, the stronger separation is the separation between two types of numbers - natural numbers (1, 2, 3,...) and fractional number (0.01, 0.02,... etc). So it makes sense to use the stronger separator to separate dollars and cents, and use commas to separate thousands and millions etc"

I strongly believe the short positions are in actual fact, absolutely massive, and that simple maths will eventually force a margin call triggering the MOASS."
2021-04-09 17:50:37,wallstreetbets,"Hey buddy.. you want to know why it is going back up again? Stock prices is kind of determined by supply and demand. When the hedgies overloaded the market with fake shares and apes keeps buying and holding. Then when hedgies has to buy back since all they did was load the market with IOUs, the stock goes back up. We're at the point where hedgies owe millions over the entire float.. if you still don't think it is coming up, I guess you could head over to gme meltdown and share some memes over there. :)"

2021-04-09 14:29:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that’s the plan. Thanks for some more confirmation, I was basing this simply on the fact that WD-40 has never let me down before."
2021-04-09 16:33:49,wallstreetbets,"i didnt time it right at the bottom, caught it at 264 and bought 52 shares. I'd not heard of this company being listed stand-alone before. I figured WD40 was owned by some other mega corp brand. Nice rally end of day. 91% institution owned. The selloff was probably algorithmic based, since it made no sense based on the actual reason why they missed their earnings."
2021-04-09 15:50:56,wallstreetbets,"It literally went back up after dropping by 15%.  The idea that a $4 billion company with an internationally recognized brand doesn't have buyers 15% lower than original price is beyond silly.  Selling after the earnings call was rational.  Dumping was catching the fear bug.  

5% already recovered and it should be another 5% before I think it enters rational territory"

2021-04-09 14:10:54,wallstreetbets,Bought a few calls this morning. And I’ll hold them over the weekend
2021-04-09 16:53:40,wallstreetbets,KHC has been a genuinely good play for me. Bought and sold some options then actually invested in a few hundred shares. They took a huge hit with all of their goodwill write downs but are back on track
2021-04-09 18:02:30,wallstreetbets,I’m also long on KHC but they apparently have production issues. Plus food prices are going to inflate idk how that will translate into its stock price
2021-04-09 13:57:47,wallstreetbets,I think that is the way.   That and 4/23.   The 4/09 obviously didn't work as planned because of the massive shorting at open.
2021-04-09 18:37:04,wallstreetbets,I'm basing it off short shares available drop by 2 million same time giant red candles hit and share price went from $41.12 to $39.98  with massive volume this morning. And same thing happened day before.
2021-04-09 18:01:16,wallstreetbets,Yeeeeeaaahh no
2021-04-09 13:37:23,wallstreetbets,"Why not look at a chart of IV before you post such nonsense. Either IV has to go up (and it has been falling over the year) or the stock needs to go up (about 15% between now and Jan 2022) for these to pay off.

Seriously, this is terrible investment advice."
2021-04-09 15:51:29,wallstreetbets,"Problem with this trade (and all BRK Leaps) is Buffett is 90 years old. If he dies in the next 9mos, which is very much a non-zero probability, then this trade is toast as BRK is down 10-15% regardless of what the market does.

You’re not just watching vol and the market, but also hoping an old man doesn’t slip in the shower."

2021-04-09 13:39:10,wallstreetbets,Why not just buy Berkshire B stock then?
2021-04-09 13:42:00,wallstreetbets,"IV of 16% on 265 is only pricing in a 1 standard deviation move to 307 which is \~1.4x current book value per share, wheras fair value can be 1.5x-2x book value. I am making a claim that the MM's are mispricing the IV at current level.

&#x200B;

I think fair value is > 350."
2021-04-09 13:59:43,wallstreetbets,"before you get all hostile and angry, look at IV30/60 vs. HV30/60 and you'll see how incredibly cheap Berkshire's IV is right now with IV percentile of 6%."

2021-04-09 15:55:37,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. 

I think the stock goes up if WB dies. Like AAPL did when Jobs died. There will be an activist here to break it up as the SOTP value is much greater than the market is giving berk credit for."
2021-04-09 16:16:51,wallstreetbets,"...and you're up $20 g's today as they moved to $5.08 with the movement in the underlying.

2021-04-09 16:52:01,wallstreetbets,"with all due respect, this is not proof that you made $400k profit on the trade. 

Also, if you made the same trade 2 months ago, that makes this trade not the ""greatest option arbitrage ever"" but the ""greatest option arbitrage of the past 2 months that I've been involved with"" no?

All that being said, this did look like a potentially solid trade until I read u/aka0007 comments above"
2021-04-09 13:56:44,wallstreetbets,"It isn’t, OP is just retarded"
2021-04-09 13:53:59,wallstreetbets,Day trader nonsense. We all know these day traders are all talk no return.
2021-04-09 14:07:57,wallstreetbets,"right, because you say so."
2021-04-09 13:53:17,wallstreetbets,I think that’s a very solid trade. I appreciate you sharing. I think IV is too low for this environment.
2021-04-09 14:52:44,wallstreetbets,"Look at a 3 Year Chart of BRK.B IV (or look at 5 years) and it is clear IV is still overall high. For a company like BRK.B with a focus on value investing, with a move past COVID based volatility in the market, IV is most likely going down further.

Heck, the whole market has IV going down the past two months which is in part why options have been pretty brutal to hold lately.

You are essentially betting on IV going up or at least remaining constant and that your calculations are correct reflections of what the option should be priced at. Option pricing formulas are beyond me (and my understanding is they are at best a way of estimating what an option should be priced at, not an absolute), so if there is an arbitrage opportunity based on some quantitive analysis good luck.

I was not angry and apologize if my comment came off as hostile, but you are posting about quantative analysis with virtually no one here having the training nor tools to even understand if what you are suggesting is correct. Further, simple logic would tell you that sophisticated option writers are very familiar and have computer systems that run these quantative calculations, which is used to help compute bid-ask spreads offered. For a relatively stable stock with a relatively stable option price, it runs counter to logic that it should be assumed the pricing is incorrect. Sorry, some guy posting that option pricing is incorrect from a quanative perspective is going to raise my hackles a bit. Especially with such a limited analysis. Further, the whole BRK.B option chain has this same pricing pattern, so you are in effect saying every option on BRK.B is priced wrong, not just the one you mentioned. Sounds a little incredulous. Not saying you are necessarily wrong, but I think it would take a bit more work here before you can say this with confidence."
2021-04-09 16:23:50,wallstreetbets,"yep.... 

I think these cons go to $20+ by the fall."
2021-04-09 17:17:37,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the shout out.

FYI, my issue was with the IV points not betting on the underlying stock going up. I have no reason to assume he is lying about his gain, but for every stock I have betted right on and made money on the options I feel I have two that I lose on...

Basically, my take is do this trade if you think BRK.B should go up in value, not based on assuming IV will increase. Might be a quick return or might take till year-end, no idea."
2021-04-09 17:00:32,wallstreetbets,k w/e you say.

It's an auction system. Depending on the number of buyers/sellers the day you buy/sell the price you think you can get for a security can vary wildly from the execution price of the trade. (Or if there isn't enough volume to pick up the amount of shares you want to buy/sell. 

The dark pools are more like craigslist. An institution posts a stock they have and what they are willing to get rid of it for. And another institution can pick up those shares without the order fucking up the normal operations of the stock during the trading day. This way, an institution can move a large number of shares without paying the spread to a market maker saving potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars on a large trade.

Dark pool is kind of a strange way to describe the direct institution to institution trading and one can see why those ""dark pools"" exist. The issue imo is that those should be more the exception than the norm for stock trading.

Edit: no, traders don't refer to it as the ""dark pool""."
2021-04-09 17:28:01,wallstreetbets,The term dark and lit pools is quite common amongst those in the financial space that trade. Nearly all large “reputable” firms perform trades in dark pools because they don’t want to affect market pricing in addition to not getting killed by slippage.
2021-04-09 18:17:26,wallstreetbets,So you think they are hedging for DFV calls?
2021-04-09 19:20:32,wallstreetbets,Yes but he wouldn't hold his options this long just to sell them. I'm sure he will exercise them and the crowd will go wild when his YOLO update shows that he did.

2021-04-09 17:18:15,wallstreetbets,"That's not how it works. If they buy the calls at that premium and exercise them it's no different then buying the shares at open market except they have to pay the time value as well.

Exercising the contracts actually gives them the shares and they could use that to cover but there is no logic in doing this. The premiums placed on those calls are more expensive then buying the shares in the open market. Buying the calls does nothing to 'kick the can down the road'. They are literally paying a shitton more to cover their shorts then buying at the open market of they do this.

So its more likely something else such as people rolling contracts. The premiums the MMs make on these are ridiculous so they are happy to oblige."

2021-04-09 15:09:13,wallstreetbets,Yea that’s why they are in the dark pool 😉. I’m honestly curious of how the traders refer to it while they’re doing it.  Like is it just a specific group/kind of trader that does it or can any “certified” trader do it?
2021-04-09 17:31:03,wallstreetbets,">Edit: no, traders don’t refer to it as “dark pool.”

How anti climactic 😂.  Joking aside, thank you for the explanation! That makes perfect sense actually, more sense than the article I was reading about it.  So basically, they are taking out the middle man to invest in each other’s companies or a rich dude going direct to a company and buying a bunch of shares?  Sounds like that would be more of a long term arrangement type of deal and not necessarily options that would expire in a month or less."
2021-04-09 17:34:31,wallstreetbets,"The more people explain this the more it sounds like a parallel stock market for extremely rich people.  It allows them to pay with stocks with out smashing all of Wall Street.  With that said, was the whole credit default swaps gig that caused the recession in the dark pool or the lit one?  I ask because that sounds like something “reputable” firms would mess with without a majority being able to see it happen.

2021-04-09 18:08:40,wallstreetbets,They don't pay the option premium but a set predetermined fee to the mm to essentially use their bonafide mm abilities to create a synthetic share.called a buy/write transaction
2021-04-09 17:55:30,wallstreetbets,a lot cheaper than closing out their positions though
2021-04-09 19:45:14,wallstreetbets,"Actually there are .50 call otions 4/16 and 7/16. I have bought them in extreme dips and exercised them immediately. when you look at them during the trading day the middle bid is always just a little under buying 100 shares at the market, the premium becomes instant return on the day. I have done this 4 times now, every time it lowered my average price per share by a lot. I know this is expensive but if you lower your bid by another 5 cents the option goes through, been getting a hundred shares anywhere bwteen 50 to 70 cents on the dollar. maybe this is somehow what they are doing to cover shorts and make profit."

2021-04-09 17:40:08,wallstreetbets,"It's an independent market. It's not just rich dudes investing in each other's companies. Retail clients with a large enough position can access this market through a brokerages block equity trading desk. But unless you are selling $1 million+ worth of a stock you could just set up a limit order or something. 

It's just a secondary market where you can buy/sell directly with other institutions. Contrary to the name, dark pools serve a great purpose imo. If you wanted to sell a bike and you knew someone who wanted to buy a bike, why would both of you need to go to an auctioneer to make that trade? 

It's more similar to an over the counter transaction but for larger purchases. If the ""dark pools"" didn't exist you'd see a LOT more volatility in certain stocks and WAY more insider trading imo since the large transactions would absolutely fuck up the price of a stock during normal hours. There's be an even greater incentive to get ahead of that trade if you had knowledge of it ahead of time."

2021-04-09 17:58:37,wallstreetbets,"Its not a stupid question. Buying the calls, if they are newly issued by MMs would still cause the price to increase as MMs delta hedge the contracts by buying shares.

If they are buying these from someone who already owned the contracts then it has less of an effect on the price as those contracts were already delta hedged and the MMs have the shares to cover.

But if they exercise the contracts immediately it could cause the price to go up as the MMs usually increase their hedge the closer to the expiry date. 

But in this case, these contracts are way ITM so they are probably fully hedged if they are buying from a person that already has the contracts."

2021-04-09 17:51:22,wallstreetbets,"The OI is not zero, what the hell are you talking about. DFV literally has 500 of these contracts, are you saying these are fake?

Whatever the reason it is being traded, doing it to hide a short position is absolutely not one of them. You buy these contracts and your loss is more than if you covered in the open market. Options are contracts that give you the right to buy the shares....explain to me how buying this hides a short position or hides a FTD? You are literally able to buy the shares so you can legit cover the FTDs.

They are buying it to cover FTDs? Then its no different then buying on the open market except its more expensive becuase the contract has a time value as well as the intrinsic  value. They wouldn't buy this contract and then not exercise it either. You literally are not kicking the can down the road by doing this becuase you now have the shares to cover.

I understand you want to see that the short position is still very high but you can't just say that something you don't understand means it's a foul play to hide shorts.

You don't believe that it's people rolling over their contracts that's fine and a debatable argument, but saying that the only other explanation is someone hiding their short position is definitely not the answer."
2021-04-09 18:23:00,wallstreetbets,"Dude did you even read it.... my God you're fucking lost.

A synthetic position is used by buying calls and puts that would cost less that buying the underlying stocks. They aren't doing this by buying so far ITM optins with premiums costing more than the damn shares. They would do this with much lower premium options that are much closer to the market price of the stock. The whole point is for it to cost less than buying shares. That won't happen if you are paying such a high premium for the option. So these 12$ contracts are not being used to do this becuase their premiums are fucking ridiculous expensive.

Its always good to have a control group to compare by before coming to any conclusions that it's shady or unscrupulous. It might be a very normal activity that happens with every other stock.

2021-04-09 19:33:19,wallstreetbets,Which will almost always be the case that they are not the same. the synthetic does not equal the true share most times in American options. The way you find that out is through put call parity...
2021-04-09 19:39:33,wallstreetbets,Stock = synthetic is p-c parity. Stock < synthetic (C + pv of strike - P) is a potential arbitrage scenario if you can lock in the premiums/stock price/ and strike. If anything goes against you before the orders fulfill you could be screwed
2021-04-09 19:01:41,wallstreetbets,"Yes, again this is done with options that have strike prices that are close to the market price. Not deep in the money options. 

But these are also very expensive and works if the fund and the MMs are working together. Which could be the case but they can only do it for so long before they are caught and forced to stop.

Another issue with this is that it had a time limit as the options will expire and cause a massive increase in FTDs unless they get lucky and the price tanks and they can buy the shares back at lower price then what they sold em for.

But again this is not what is happening with the $12c trades from OPs original post."

 It could be people selling their contracts a week before it expires to make their profits becuase they can't afford to exercise the contracts or they don't want to exercise them.

A lot of traders don't exercise the contracts and just play the premiums gains. It makes sense to sell a week before expirey becuase you get some time value premium along with the intrinsic value of the option. 

It could be traders fearing the price us going down and want to sell and take their profits now. 
 
It could be a fund hedging their positions.

It could be many things."

If he were to execute the contract, say Apple was trading for $140. He has the right to buy 100 shares at $123.75 ($12,375). The shares are currently worth $14,000. 


So if he were to sell the shares right after executing the contract, the profit would be $14,000 - $12,375 paid for the shares - $850 for the contract = $775."

However, let’s say Apple was trading at $140 a share near the expiration date, he may be able to sell the contract for a profit, since buying 100 shares of a stock for $123.75 is a great deal when the shares are worth $140.

2021-04-09 13:48:22,wallstreetbets,I'd say apple will be up 50-75 percent for the year. They're way too quiet. Theyre up to something massive and stock is finally trending up confidently for the first time since like august.
2021-04-09 18:04:51,wallstreetbets,I'm very bullish on AAPL this month.

You only saw the majority of the voices and not the logic. You invested on emotions. 

Now you will either enter the WSB graveyard where no one will remember you and cry about all you could have done with that money, or you will figure out how to save what you can and make better moves."

2021-04-09 14:01:11,wallstreetbets,"Better then trust you, dumbass Fanny pack twat"
2021-04-09 13:56:36,wallstreetbets,"Retail can not impact price action enough to help an already inflated stock price. You need MMs to make short term investments and also you need options. Options drive price upwards. Look up SoftBank and last September for example. 

The IV is too high to make it worthwhile to buy. If no one buys options the price lags stagnant. Retail can’t keep it alive that way. The iv also isn’t manipulation. When you buy an option someone on the other side has shares. It’s high risk to sell options to someone on a stock that’s had history of dramatic spikes because if your call hits the target they’d lose their shares and lose money. That’s why you won’t find things that squeeze over and over and over again.

Fool me once, Shame on you. Fool me twice - you get it? You can’t win because the game was adjusted. You can’t fool them.

You just need to take the gains and build them up elsewhere so you can win the *real* fight - financial independence. The market is just too well oiled to trick a bunch of experts with more tools than you."
2021-04-09 14:03:42,wallstreetbets,"Where do you get the misconception that retail needs to drive the price alone?

Insiders and institutions already own OVER 100% of the shares outstanding.

You think the shorts just magically disappear and everyone goes home? They mathematically cannot win if people hold."
2021-04-09 14:01:23,wallstreetbets,Your just a twat
2021-04-09 14:09:07,wallstreetbets,"They don’t own that much it’s a lie fed to you in the megathreads to trick you. They aren’t that exposed. 

Even if you know a secret, and know they have over 100% it wouldn’t matter. The market is predictive in nature, it’s pretty much all speculation - so if major market movers don’t believe you or don’t care, it won’t move the price. You can’t coordinate an effort large enough to call back all the shares because financial institutions won’t do the same."
2021-04-09 14:16:44,wallstreetbets,"""lie fed to you in the megathreads"" you're actually retarded.

The institutional ownership is publicly available data and not some fucking  ""theory fed to people in the megathreads"". It was already over 100% before january, and with the new reports after january it is still over 100%. 

If you are too fucking cynical to open your eyes, atleast stop spreading lies to other people, ok?"
2021-04-09 14:24:07,wallstreetbets,"I’m not spreading lies the short float is not 100%, it’s under 20%. The shorts covered and then switched positions to your side to make up for it"
2021-04-09 14:47:12,wallstreetbets,"Love how you are being downvoted for truth because it doesn't fit into people confirmation bias here. Delusion has really kicked in here. Everybody is on their own step of the grieving process. But yeah the shorts took their hit and covered, they don't sit in losing positions praying that they make the money back. Every decision is analytical and unemotional. There was no reason to stay in the GME positions in February so they exited. Wherever you are getting the over 100% institutional ownership of shares from i would stop getting financial news/data from that source right away. Downvote this comment all you want that doesn't make it wrong and in 3 months i can come back to this when people are saying ""market was manipulated, we got unlucky with GME"" as proof that that isn't true you guys were just too much of pussies to exit a losing position. Take the hit and move on the ""hedgies"" sure as hell did."
2021-04-09 14:48:30,wallstreetbets,"I never said anything about the short positions. 

I'm arguing with a retarded dude, who cannot read. What has my life come to.

When you go back to work on one monday and Melvin is bankrupt and can't pay you, ask yourself was it worth it."
2021-04-09 14:55:02,wallstreetbets,Show me your source. Show me this 100% short - I can’t read numbers that don’t exist so show me how I’m wrong.
2021-04-09 12:42:11,wallstreetbets,You are ruining your own life by buying weekly options on retardedly high implied volatility stocks
2021-04-09 12:37:13,wallstreetbets,"Damm, thats some good loss porn😍😍😍"
2021-04-09 12:55:20,wallstreetbets,"~~G~~**ME ruining my life.**  


There fixed it for you."
2021-04-09 12:37:37,wallstreetbets,"Join the club.
Edit: you were warned about options, and you're saying in previous posts that you lost due to selling shares. Okie"
2021-04-09 12:59:57,wallstreetbets,Weekly options is like the express lane to actual retardation.
2021-04-09 13:14:52,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit you spent $11,308 per contract. That is insanity on a whole new level."
2021-04-09 13:23:18,wallstreetbets,You belong here
2021-04-09 13:26:25,wallstreetbets,This will have to do i guess... (unzips pants)
2021-04-09 12:46:52,wallstreetbets,You spent $11k per on a two option. I don’t think it’s GME that’s destroying your life......poor decision...?
2021-04-09 12:56:27,wallstreetbets,F.... don’t buy options on GME.. they are too expensive... it is better to sell them.
2021-04-09 14:11:13,wallstreetbets,No no you ruined it by buying calls expiring in 2 weeks
2021-04-09 12:56:41,wallstreetbets,I'd advice you to stop playing with options : it's just not meant for some people - stick to stocks since 95% of all people lose money in options lol 🌼
2021-04-09 12:39:04,wallstreetbets,Why the hell didn't you buy the stock?
2021-04-09 13:02:25,wallstreetbets,You retards blowing 50k on something you don't fully understand is my favorite part of this sub.
2021-04-09 16:16:49,wallstreetbets,Dang dude you're kind of bad at this.
2021-04-09 12:38:45,wallstreetbets,Didn’t ur wife’s BF ever tell u to never go Full Retard? This is why u Buy SHARES🚀🌕

2021-04-09 12:38:28,wallstreetbets,that's why I buy stocks
2021-04-09 13:18:12,wallstreetbets,You should get out of the market
2021-04-09 13:20:46,wallstreetbets,Give us a heads up next week what plays you’re gonna make so we can inverse it and make bank
2021-04-09 13:40:59,wallstreetbets,"For any newbies to investing. (Not financial advice) if u don’t know what u are doing, just buy shares. At least this way it won’t expire worthless and you lose everything when you are wrong. With shares it’s only a loss when u press sell 🥸💎🙌🏻"
2021-04-09 12:44:27,wallstreetbets,Should read GME Thread Ruining my life. If all you do is browse that Thread daily you will think GME is going to $500 everyday based on the circle jerk confirmation bias everyone spews
2021-04-09 13:21:30,wallstreetbets,"Dude you are ruining your life. Your playing options and have no idea what you’re doing..

You don’t even have a spread and this is the most volatile stock ever...


Why aren’t you just buying the stock?"
2021-04-09 13:43:29,wallstreetbets,God damn that's fine porn
2021-04-09 13:44:46,wallstreetbets,Let me know when you start raffling off time with your wife to make up for the loss
2021-04-09 14:04:49,wallstreetbets,"And then next week, you're gonna say NIO ruined your life."
2021-04-09 15:30:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, and that damn McDonald's super sized for only a few cents more is ruining my life, too."
2021-04-09 13:25:24,wallstreetbets,"Did GME put a gun up to your head and force you to buy short term options instead of shares? We've been saying it's a share play forever, did you not see the loss porn from people buying risky short term options in the past?"
2021-04-09 13:42:06,wallstreetbets,good that i am too dumb to know what calls are
2021-04-09 12:54:48,wallstreetbets,Lmao. I was hyped on the green square until I saw -27%

2021-04-09 13:35:30,wallstreetbets,What do we say to the god of death?
2021-04-09 13:47:14,wallstreetbets,Fuck! Mon is a reset to the game buy more options. Options mean more than 1 path right?
2021-04-09 14:28:36,wallstreetbets,"How did you not realize the the break even price is $308? When you first purchased . 

Start praying  that it bounces back your way hahaha"

2021-04-09 13:35:35,wallstreetbets,"LOL
Retard, it's your problem. Nobody told you the Way always has been the shares?"
2021-04-09 13:53:46,wallstreetbets,"Your retard ass was ruin by yourself when you bought option. GME is share game, not option. Who the fuck spend 10K on a option."
2021-04-09 13:59:17,wallstreetbets,I just don't understand why you wouldn't just buy the stock and hold
2021-04-09 14:23:43,wallstreetbets,Jesus fucking christ. Time to admit you've been brain washed by other bag holders. I feel for you man. So glad I got out on that first drop ages ago.
2021-04-09 14:55:04,wallstreetbets,Levels of autism that shouldn’t even be possible goin on here.
2021-04-09 15:36:24,wallstreetbets,"na man you did that,"
2021-04-09 17:03:46,wallstreetbets,"Just buy shares, otherwise you're feeding the HFs money to help short the stock."
2021-04-09 18:32:34,wallstreetbets,Why would you buy options 😭
2021-04-09 18:54:05,wallstreetbets,Don’t buy options retard. Buy shares and this won’t happen
2021-04-09 19:05:58,wallstreetbets,I don't know what you thought you expected.

2021-04-09 13:57:17,wallstreetbets,"Now this is a smooth brained take. Buy stocks, not options you silly ape. 

I hope you also know this means I’m going to have to tell your wife about it.

2021-04-09 12:37:31,wallstreetbets,so sell before it drops to 40 or just buy more
2021-04-09 12:36:29,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-09 13:37:52,wallstreetbets,"After you loose it all get back out there, hustle to make it all back, put it back in and loose it all again. This is the kind of circle jerk I’m looking for."
2021-04-09 14:04:53,wallstreetbets,"Good think IV is way lower now, could of done monthly. But good luck"
2021-04-09 14:08:24,wallstreetbets,Should've just bought shares with that. No premiums
2021-04-09 17:46:40,wallstreetbets,Don't think about it too much
2021-04-09 16:54:52,wallstreetbets,Buy more pussy

2021-04-09 19:23:44,wallstreetbets,It's only a loss if you sell
2021-04-09 13:16:45,wallstreetbets,I came here to comment this exactly
2021-04-09 15:28:13,wallstreetbets,My only regret is that I didn't sell him those calls
2021-04-09 17:24:44,wallstreetbets,Dont bother. This is said every single day. Monday will be more posts like this.
2021-04-09 14:02:07,wallstreetbets,and on RH of all things.
2021-04-09 14:40:20,wallstreetbets,"\^\^This

With high IV, buy stonks and hold."
2021-04-09 15:54:38,wallstreetbets,You're not wrong but the whole purpose of this sub is FDs on meme stocks.
2021-04-09 13:46:20,wallstreetbets,You are ruining your own life by buying weekly options on retarded~~ly high implied volatility~~ stocks
2021-04-09 13:00:25,wallstreetbets,Lol 😂
2021-04-09 14:01:35,wallstreetbets,Beat me to it lol
2021-04-09 12:42:01,wallstreetbets,I lost in shares too in late Jan and early Feb.
2021-04-09 15:37:30,wallstreetbets,"You guys are really almost as smooth brained as OP. How is it a weekly if he bought a $300 call for $100 ?

He FOMOd at the second squeeze when gme went past 300 in February"
2021-04-09 19:24:50,wallstreetbets,...I feel attacked with my QS 4/16 46.50c
2021-04-09 15:47:44,wallstreetbets,What’s your point?
2021-04-09 13:23:43,wallstreetbets,Thanks bro.
2021-04-09 12:55:55,wallstreetbets,"It was a terrible decision, it isn’t GME that’s ruining his life"
2021-04-09 12:50:28,wallstreetbets,Yeah I did a double take when the quantity was 2. Wtf stupid
2021-04-09 12:48:42,wallstreetbets,Not $11k.. I actually spent $22.6K. Of course it’s my decisions that’s ruining me.
2021-04-09 14:43:23,wallstreetbets,I bought it much earlier. Maybe around mid March.
2021-04-09 15:33:21,wallstreetbets,"I play LEAPS on tech stonks, they are fun and pay off very well"
2021-04-09 13:45:27,wallstreetbets,I don't think he'd have made any money buying the stock either lol
2021-04-09 12:59:37,wallstreetbets,It’s WallStreetBets. We play options here.
2021-04-09 12:40:13,wallstreetbets,I did but it went down. So I put whatever I had in calls.
2021-04-09 13:04:06,wallstreetbets,hug the nanners
2021-04-09 13:22:50,wallstreetbets,Yea he’d only be down 60 percent
2021-04-09 13:42:26,wallstreetbets,I don't think he'd have made any money buying shares either.
2021-04-09 17:34:55,wallstreetbets,Then r/stocks is for you. Wsb is options.
2021-04-09 12:45:24,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I have been a victim of that."
2021-04-09 15:36:27,wallstreetbets,Because he’s king retard
2021-04-09 17:09:30,wallstreetbets,"That's the correct amount of dumb, if you were significantly dumber you would be buying them without knowing what they are, like this guy."
2021-04-09 13:42:23,wallstreetbets,I personally prefer the strategy created by the Sugondese
2021-04-09 14:41:53,wallstreetbets,"Break even comes into play when I plan to exercise the call and use the share to make profit.
If my strike price is $195 and share price goes to $250, the premium for $195 calls will go up and I can sell the calls for profit. I have done that on the past. Didn’t work out this time."
2021-04-09 17:32:38,wallstreetbets,Donating money
2021-04-09 13:17:35,wallstreetbets,"Hoping for exactly that. Not even asking for profit. If I am able to recover $10-15K from this, I would be extremely happy."
2021-04-09 12:41:17,wallstreetbets,Yup.. not working out
2021-04-09 13:01:32,wallstreetbets,That’s the only way you can get rich
2021-04-09 16:02:58,wallstreetbets,Thank You. You’re dunb too🤣
2021-04-09 12:47:45,wallstreetbets,My options will probably expire before the GME share price drops to $40. But if doesI am gonna buy at least 1000 shares.
2021-04-09 17:23:24,wallstreetbets,I came here to watch you guys comment this exactly.
2021-04-09 15:41:51,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-04-09 16:10:57,wallstreetbets,If I was him I would dollar cost average the options.

2021-04-09 15:17:46,wallstreetbets,"You lost money in the months this stock rocketed? Bruh. IIRC, GME went down to 50-60$ for 2 weeks, and then spiked all the way up to $286.. if you missed out again, I think you should retire from stocks..."
2021-04-09 15:35:25,wallstreetbets,So GME has been bellow $20 for over 1 year and it hits $300 usd and you FOMO buy it and it's GME's fault ?
2021-04-09 12:58:11,wallstreetbets,"You got caught in an echo chamber. This loser is just still stuck in denial.

We’ve all blown shit up and had to rebuild. It’s good to face the facts and look at your situation without emotions."
2021-04-09 17:58:38,wallstreetbets,We aren't in high IV options though. Our shares don't expire or feed premiums to the other team.
2021-04-09 14:05:11,wallstreetbets,Can I get tree fiddy
2021-04-09 12:58:50,wallstreetbets,Yeah looks like $11k per to me. WOW what day did you purchase these?
2021-04-09 12:49:35,wallstreetbets,Hopefully you have crushed it in the past with GME 💪🏼
2021-04-09 15:08:28,wallstreetbets,"So a monthly call... thats not better bro😂. For you, i hope we go to the moon next week."
2021-04-09 14:51:40,wallstreetbets,"oh yes he would have, the stock was at 40 fucking dollars for a month!"
2021-04-09 17:31:07,wallstreetbets,They get a pass on GME. IV was too retarded after end of January.
2021-04-09 12:49:10,wallstreetbets,You bought 300$ calls at 113 a piece on GME. WOW. Just
2021-04-09 14:46:01,wallstreetbets,You retards should be upvoting this glorious ass yolo. Where am I anymore SMH.
2021-04-09 12:48:22,wallstreetbets,You can't lose if you don't sell. You just lose if you paperhand. See you from the moon
2021-04-09 14:04:34,wallstreetbets,Nah he bought the calls at $190 so he’d only be down whatever 40/190 is
2021-04-09 14:04:58,wallstreetbets,He would only be down 22% ish
2021-04-09 14:05:26,wallstreetbets,Theta gang
2021-04-09 15:22:47,wallstreetbets,Well.. this is now your awakening.
2021-04-09 17:43:02,wallstreetbets,">I plan to exercise the call

With what money?"
2021-04-09 19:51:37,wallstreetbets,"Even if $250 happens, it's unlikely you'll make money.  Depends on how close to expiry it happens. Like the man says, Google IV crush, and gain at least a passing familiarity with theta.."
2021-04-09 17:37:22,wallstreetbets,Google IV crush before you make your next options trade.
2021-04-09 14:41:19,wallstreetbets,Hopefully it’ll jump early next before theta dry bones the rest of it. Good luck!
2021-04-09 13:03:11,wallstreetbets,🤪 you don’t know all the tools out there.
2021-04-09 13:02:23,wallstreetbets,Don’t buy more man. Don’t listen to these guys - half are paid bots.
2021-04-09 17:46:39,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-04-09 19:47:42,wallstreetbets,I did that. Today I bought 2 more contracts with same strike and expiry at $9.55 and averaged is down to $61 per contract. IF GME goes back to $200 before 4/23 I will recover at least $10-12K.
2021-04-09 14:40:02,wallstreetbets,"""WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN"" - THE WHO"
2021-04-09 14:46:46,wallstreetbets,"i disagree with this, if by echo chamber you mean people being bullish on gme, the ""echo chamber"" was saying to buy only shares, and if he would have done that, im sure he would be profitable still, like most!"
2021-04-09 12:52:35,wallstreetbets,I did once but still overall loss is $60 K.
2021-04-09 15:30:56,wallstreetbets,He didn't put his money in when the stock was $40.
2021-04-09 12:51:22,wallstreetbets,"Not $300 calls. $195 calls. It was ITM when I bought it. 
How did you calculate $300?"
2021-04-09 15:35:08,wallstreetbets,"I know this is WSB, but surely we can think of better alternatives than just losing 22% of your savings."
2021-04-09 13:03:34,wallstreetbets,You don’t know math
2021-04-09 13:32:15,wallstreetbets,"Wait who is paying people to promote GME? It's not shorts because they want the stock to actually go down, it's not longs because retail investors are tiny compared to the short volume and wont be able to drag them out of the slow decline themselves and paying money for the bots doesnt make sense when they could just buy themselves."

2021-04-09 14:44:31,wallstreetbets,"Damn dude, you should have bought shares like EVERYONE was saying, its not too late to still do that!!!!"
2021-04-09 16:11:53,wallstreetbets,Dollar cost average the options
2021-04-09 18:52:10,wallstreetbets,I could almost bet that for close to the same price he could have bought 100 shares and sold a contract and covered half of his original cost.
2021-04-09 12:59:29,wallstreetbets,"There's break even price cause of IV. 'Tard.

In calls, you have to pay premium. And premium is high on GME.

You don't understand a thing about calls do you?"
2021-04-09 13:25:49,wallstreetbets,"You’re dumber than I thought. I’m sorry, stop trading or just buy a FAANG stock and delete the app and just hold"
2021-04-09 15:51:15,wallstreetbets,Ask OP he seems to have a keen expertise in that department
2021-04-09 13:04:12,wallstreetbets,Op does not know either.
2021-04-09 13:34:19,wallstreetbets,"You know hedge funds and MMs are on both sides of this right? They do not always go into a long term bullish position, they do short term as well. The price action is not mostly retail lol"
2021-04-09 17:33:50,wallstreetbets,It's still a $195 strike call.
2021-04-09 13:03:51,wallstreetbets,"Subtract the premium from the break even and you will get the strike price. Learn basic arithmetic, you retarded piece of shit. Lol 😂"
2021-04-09 14:02:48,wallstreetbets,Lol he could’ve bought an itm Amazon call too 😂
2021-04-09 13:05:09,wallstreetbets,Where’s your Lamestock gain posts then🤨
2021-04-09 13:41:43,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I just dont see how either side profits from botting to get retailers to buy. Retail makes too small a portion of anything and at most keep the price flatter, I expect most institutional investors would rather large price swings."
2021-04-09 19:58:39,wallstreetbets,"It is but the strike call isn't going to make him money. The premium for the contract is unreal.

I think he legitimately believes he just needs to hit the strike price. He is in for a rude awakening especially with only a few DTE"
2021-04-09 13:10:52,wallstreetbets,I think this ape failed pre-k
2021-04-09 13:12:10,wallstreetbets,Clearly you don't understand options

2021-04-09 13:42:57,wallstreetbets,Because it’s free money.
2021-04-09 13:14:59,wallstreetbets,"No, I don’t think you understood my comment.
BTW none of us understand a lot. We are proud retards. If you’re smart, go to Wall Street."
2021-04-09 13:19:08,wallstreetbets,Give me one way
2021-04-09 13:52:21,wallstreetbets,How?
2021-04-09 13:26:39,wallstreetbets,Clearly if you are buying ITM options that need to go up 50% just to make a profit. Lol. Retarded
2021-04-09 13:55:29,wallstreetbets,"The irony is I worked at Wall Street. Trade restrictions no fun.

Working in SF here now and YOLOing 9 to 5 with day trading so much more entertaining while at 'work'."
2021-04-09 14:01:38,wallstreetbets,"The break even is 305 because you spent 113 premium on 192 per share so 113 + 192 is 305! You don’t know first grade math yet you have $20k to spend on this FD shit? 

Can I get tree fiddy?"
2021-04-09 16:19:11,wallstreetbets,Just based on the screenshot I’d take any financial advice from you with a brick of salt.
2021-04-09 13:20:41,wallstreetbets,I know you where going to say that. If your where not such an asshole I would share. I think I will not. You learn one day if you are in this game. Maybe it better that way. You have to keep an open mind. There are many ways to skin a cat.
2021-04-09 14:03:25,wallstreetbets,"If you want to buy something there is stock interest. If they go along with you the price rises easily because you are a team. They have to assess risk the entire time. When they know they made most of what they possibly could they take their winnings and go do something else, or, they hedge and switch sides. The same happened btw for shorts - some shorts said “let’s hedge the situation- we’ll buy calls and go with this retail surge because we can make money all the way too the top and buy cheap puts and gain money on the way down” they made money both ways which is more than just holding short positions 

A hedge fund is just a group trying to play both sides to squeeze as much money from something as possible."
2021-04-09 16:13:27,wallstreetbets,I mean based on the comments here...
2021-04-09 14:21:25,wallstreetbets,Many people have poor risk management skills .
2021-04-09 13:21:25,wallstreetbets,"I asked for a way, which is being open minded.

You just don’t have a way"
2021-04-09 13:39:43,wallstreetbets,This dude literally goes around being a bear about everything but a shitty drink called fizz. He’s an actual twat lol
2021-04-09 14:50:06,wallstreetbets,Except retail alone isnt going to budge this downward trend so who the fuck would be paying for bots to get retail to buy right now?
2021-04-09 14:48:36,wallstreetbets,And that's what makes WSB beautiful. So many smooth brain posts.
2021-04-09 14:56:19,wallstreetbets,The ones in short positions are now. But also other sources keeping you here to feed you new shit. Like the Chinese penny stock scam
2021-04-09 15:20:42,wallstreetbets,I wish I had this guys 30K... so I could make proper investments. Why even buy options if you don’t truly understand it. OP should’ve have just bought shares and held for a few months and see what happens.. RIP.
2021-04-09 15:34:56,wallstreetbets,Why would shorts want retail buying stock? They'd profit more from retail not buying letting the price fall???
2021-04-09 15:33:16,wallstreetbets,"I think he did that ... ouch.
Some  people won’t come out alive,   much less profit with GME ."
2021-04-09 15:44:13,wallstreetbets,They reposition their short positions at a significantly higher price because there is more room for the price to fall making them more money.
2021-04-09 17:32:09,wallstreetbets,"Really unfortunate, but that’s just the nature of the stock market. Everyone can’t win"
2021-04-09 15:46:29,wallstreetbets,It shouldnt take a month to do that? Theres no reason to be paying bots to get people to prolong the fall if that was their plan
2021-04-09 15:47:42,wallstreetbets,You’ve exceeded my tolerance level. Maybe you are a paid p u m p e r. Idk. But I’m done. You are one that can’t be saved

As we continue to hold we finally meet the peak and die from a blanket of arrows and everyone sells at 100 million a share."

2021-04-09 14:08:20,wallstreetbets,"Also, no. Not directly. Simplified, his net market value has decreased a shit ton, but not because he shorted GME. Before all this started, he sold minority shares of the BBall team he owns to Gabe Plotkin. I’m not entirely clear on the exact mechanics of how it hit MJ, but it seems like it was more about shares of the Charolette Hornets than anything with GME."

That battle caused the persians to run out of time, but they came back 10 years later and did quite a job.  But mostly, the persians left because their supply lines were too long; 100 years later they wound up getting all of ionia anyway.

Apart from that, they didn't wear their capes during battle, they used different ways of holding the shield, and they didn't generally throw their spears away."

2021-04-09 18:08:49,wallstreetbets,"I bought some late may calls at 24. I sold them yesterday when the stock dipped to 22.90, which was my exit point. I still had faith in the company and decided to just sell my options and fold all the remaining into shares. I think I'm going to hold the company for a long time. I think I was dumb to try and time the reversal because honestly this company could be on the receiving end of another sell off - but I think long term, within a few years, the company will do extremely well. Currently holding along side my Tesla shares."
2021-04-09 18:11:52,wallstreetbets,This looks like a VERY solid investment.

2021-04-09 15:50:56,wallstreetbets,I think there is a demo coming up in a few weeks. But this is a good hold foe the next 5+ years.
2021-04-09 17:43:35,wallstreetbets,was over that for a while. 23.5 is a good average.
2021-04-09 15:20:56,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-04-09 16:18:19,wallstreetbets,"It's next Wed, April 14. 11am EST."
2021-04-09 16:19:29,wallstreetbets,Nice!
2021-04-09 16:24:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the last demo was Jan 26, the run up started 2 days prior of that when it closed above the 20 day moving avg. I'm hoping for the same type of move next monday and tuesday. Looks like the same setup."
2021-04-09 18:44:41,wallstreetbets,"other than ""it happened last time"", is there any reason why a product demonstration that's been public knowledge for weeks if not months is gonna translate to any substantial price movement? End of January was also just a ridiculously crazy week for the whole market

Full disclosure I'm bullish as fuck on Palantir and plan to retire in about 10 years solely from Karp related gainz.....but I'm just not sure demo day is gonna do what everyone seems to think it will. I hope I'm wrong so I can retire earlier."
2021-04-09 16:28:03,wallstreetbets,Bought yesterday and I’m up 15% now. Crazy good timing considering they got the rights to the World Cup
2021-04-09 18:05:56,wallstreetbets,Saw the runup to +20% today! Insane. Wish I bought at open like a few I know.
2021-04-09 12:31:09,wallstreetbets,sometimes the degenerates are that persuasive.  fubo<<<<<< soccer company???

2021-04-09 13:27:33,wallstreetbets,"That’s it, you convinced me. I bought 3 shares with what little buying power I had in my account"
2021-04-09 13:29:08,wallstreetbets,Bought this morning at 21 but sold at 23. It's only a bump for today. Will probably be red all next week. N.F.A.
2021-04-09 12:37:32,wallstreetbets,It's surprising how many little fucks I give now.

2021-04-09 12:23:10,wallstreetbets,"I genuinely don't even notice the dips haha. I see my account value go down and my immediate thought is 'shit what's just happened with that stock I put on yesterday'.

Like, I'm invested in GME, but I've completely forgotten about it and I forget that the price does influence my account value. It doesn't feel like money anymore though."
2021-04-09 13:06:09,wallstreetbets,I'm not too concerned about the dip I'm just bothered that I put so much money into it when it was so high (after Feb). Could have got more moon tickets in this dip.
2021-04-09 14:51:04,wallstreetbets,bought 2 more at $154 to average down. ‘twas a gift.
2021-04-09 12:55:36,wallstreetbets,"this is so accurate not even phased by the dips now, wish I had  more money to go into them but hey, who cares. Now that they're ramping up their fake news I can taste the blood."
2021-04-09 13:23:10,wallstreetbets,"Bought in at $130, put only what I can afford to lose. I only have 8 shares, but whatever helps helps. Good Luck Guys!!"
2021-04-09 12:29:51,wallstreetbets,"Tbh, I hope it drops back to $40 again so I can go full retard and invest my dead dad’s inheritance money."
2021-04-09 15:20:07,wallstreetbets,up to 15 shares. Fuck you shitadel.
2021-04-09 15:36:38,wallstreetbets,Was up 102% on February 5th and now I’m down .34%. Am I doing this right?
2021-04-09 12:41:35,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the dip! Bought 4 more GME and 4 more AMC.

2021-04-09 12:28:38,wallstreetbets,True I’m just waiting for the up..... the down doesn’t effect at all it’s synthetic share.... they’ve created these 💎 hands with all the pressure from 2 months of short attacks....
2021-04-09 16:41:44,wallstreetbets,"Can’t stop, won’t stop, GameStop."
2021-04-09 16:44:24,wallstreetbets,"I was born in the dip, molded by it. I didn't see the green until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding."

2021-04-09 16:41:34,wallstreetbets,I just look every two days last week I didn’t even look at my stocks. I am at the point where I am not sure if I sell even if we are at the moon

2021-04-09 13:45:42,wallstreetbets,Yea fearless until there's a sell off. People here seem to gamble with their life savings and I really wonder why they do it.
2021-04-09 14:25:29,wallstreetbets,I think the correct term is you’ve become bagholders. Wish you guys all the luck in the world but I just don’t see it working out
2021-04-09 14:49:44,wallstreetbets,"Just curious, why are y’all still in this? I understand investing long term but it seems the squeeze already happened in early March and it just makes more sense to wait until the price drops before buying back in"
2021-04-09 16:48:16,wallstreetbets,fearless or penniless ?
2021-04-09 18:16:31,wallstreetbets,"I hope that you win your bet, but I fear that the correct title for this post should be:

2021-04-09 13:20:33,wallstreetbets,It’s only a dip until it’s the last time the price ever gets this high. Go look at jdsu stock (viav now).
2021-04-09 12:52:18,wallstreetbets,"Edit: I forgot to draw up some colorful charts with lots of triangles to objectively quantify “most”. That’s how we do DD here right?

Being resigned to one’s fate... is not the same as being fearless.

Most people aren’t willing to take a loss at this point, and are hoping they can at least recoup their initial investment.

Which coincidentally, is the same reason it has been unable to punch above $250.

Most folks don’t believe it’s going to crest $350 again.

This sub likes to pretend everyone is still on board and the reality is most people are just trying to make it out with a net zero.

I call bullshit on all these memes and everyone who is still posting them.

Edit: Not deleting cuz I ain’t no bitch."

2021-04-09 14:19:47,wallstreetbets,"I have tried my best to raise awareness of The Wall Street Conspiracy film via Reddit, YouTubers and YouTube channels, Twitter and discord mods and discord groups. Last I looked it has risen in views from 14,000 to 47,000. 
Why is it so important to me? I do not benefit in any way if people watch it, I don’t know the person who has put it on youtube, I do not know any of those involved in the making of it nor am I being paid to get people to watch it. 

Conspiracy film, sounds like a waste of time: the film was made following the crash in 2008 and was due to be aired in 2012. It was pulled literally just before it was due to be aired, a diluted version of about 5 mins was aired at a later date. This movie, as you will see was excellently produced and highlighted everything that is going on with GME and across the supposedly entire Free Market. This movie explains through individuals involved, lawyers, Company owners, Cancer company listing on the stock market areas including IPO’s, Dark pools, naked shorts, SEC, DTCC, Hedge-funds, Market Manipulation and congress. 

Why is it important, would it hurt us: the significance of the Ruling bodies involvement, SEC etc, the market manipulation, the failure for Congress to act means THEY can not pretend they don’t know and MORE importantly that they all know that we all know not just what is going on now but that they failed miserably to act after 2012. Us knowing the truth means we all know the lawyers we can contact, cases we can quote, that it shows genuine and verifiable support to all the DD presented by all the really smart apes in here and else where and for the public to be made aware. 

The really smart apes will, after viewing this film explain it better than I and will when they are talking to Congressmen or Women have proof to back them up. 

Not financial advice but arguably one of the most important significant part of the puzzle to make sure we are not fucker over again. The integrity of the entire free market is worth more than shitadel & co, more than a squeeze and add real pressure to support our situation. 

Where are my crayons... 

TL/DR: watch the bloody film before it is removed again: https://youtu.be/Kpyhnmd-ZbU"

Took the tendies and we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when GME run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew
Don't know what our wives  goin' through
I'ma have to show apes how easily vlad blows apes
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light Vlad up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you

Think you holdin' Vlad by the grapes? 
Then you haven't met the apes

Stonks, don’t drop, Vlad shuts ‘em down, on robinhoods shop
Oh, no, that's how WSB apes roll

Stonks, don’t drop, Vlad shuts ‘em down, on robinhoods shop
Oh, no, that's how WSB apes roll

Is y'all apes crazy? I'll hold stocks cuz I’m lazy
Stop actin' like a baby—mind your business, lady!
Nosy boomers get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how apes get down
Watch my apes spit rounds
Oh, you think stonks funny?
Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry (grabs tendies)

Stonks, don’t drop, Vlad shuts ‘em down, on shop
Oh, no, that's how WSB apes roll

Stonks, don’t drop, Vlad shuts ‘em down, on robinhoods shop
Oh, no, that's how WSB apes roll"

2021-04-09 14:19:18,wallstreetbets,I kept thinking it would dip all the way to $20 last time so I didn't buy at $40.  Now I'm wondering if I should buy at $40 if it dips that low in the next few weeks at all.
2021-04-09 14:19:24,wallstreetbets,That is so me right now....staying clam in the face of great destruction!

2021-04-09 14:21:54,wallstreetbets,Getting ready to buy and hold on the dip again
2021-04-09 14:22:05,wallstreetbets,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
2021-04-09 14:22:18,wallstreetbets,"Buy more, you say?

And I forking do it again if the trend continues. What a sale!
Take it back down to $40, please."
2021-04-09 14:22:38,wallstreetbets,"Apes opening accounts at their 2nd, 3rd, and brokerages to buy more GME"
2021-04-09 14:22:38,wallstreetbets,It’s just... good business
2021-04-09 14:22:56,wallstreetbets,"On our way to buy more.

2021-04-09 14:28:23,wallstreetbets,"Honestly my account could hit 0 tomorrow and I wouldn't really give a shit.

2021-04-09 14:30:04,wallstreetbets,Is it just me or is today's volume kinda a joke so far?
2021-04-09 14:30:36,wallstreetbets,"I see dips and I’m like is it low enough to buy another share, nope, still don’t have enough cash left."
2021-04-09 14:30:39,wallstreetbets,Yes.  This is exactly it.
2021-04-09 14:30:41,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-09 14:31:17,wallstreetbets,Keep losing money ape gang
2021-04-09 14:31:41,wallstreetbets,Guys this was to be expected. The harshest attack comes right before the moon
2021-04-09 14:32:23,wallstreetbets,I just laugh every time it dips I don’t know how you couldn’t with the clear manipulation
2021-04-09 14:33:17,wallstreetbets,Every dip makes us stronger 🦍🚀
2021-04-09 14:33:45,wallstreetbets,Damn this volume is dogshit

2021-04-09 14:34:58,wallstreetbets,"What’s the worst that can happen? Be poor? *evil laugh* I was born in it, molded by it"
2021-04-09 14:35:01,wallstreetbets,We also have a ping of over 9000 but that's normal
2021-04-09 14:35:18,wallstreetbets,My entire portfolio is nothing but red. I would be way to stupid to sell at this point.
2021-04-09 14:36:11,wallstreetbets,Can someone repost this joker meme where he shoots robert De Niro ? That did boost my moral last time 😂
2021-04-09 14:36:34,wallstreetbets,lmao scrolled down to find this after r/memes had one with the exact same format
2021-04-09 14:37:10,wallstreetbets,I just stare at it and make animal sounds
2021-04-09 14:37:17,wallstreetbets,There's dips happening?
2021-04-09 14:37:58,wallstreetbets,I like the stock.
2021-04-09 14:38:11,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-09 14:39:32,wallstreetbets,"Speak for yourself, I went all in February."
2021-04-09 14:39:35,wallstreetbets,Stolen off the home page of r/memes
2021-04-09 14:39:38,wallstreetbets,We fuck!
2021-04-09 14:40:12,wallstreetbets,Bought a few more at 168 thinking that was the dip 😩
2021-04-09 14:41:05,wallstreetbets,"We’ve aged since then, more calm, collected, and mature."
2021-04-09 14:41:14,wallstreetbets,I honestly dont care its weird?
2021-04-09 14:42:49,wallstreetbets,The memes will never get old.
2021-04-09 14:43:47,wallstreetbets,A good captain goes down with his ship
2021-04-09 14:44:01,wallstreetbets,"Just picked up another share because I don't give a heck.

💎✊🚀"
2021-04-09 14:44:29,wallstreetbets,This is so fucking accurate my literal only thought when it dips is “if it hits 120 again I’m buying more” I was watching that shit like a hawk when I first got in at 325
2021-04-09 14:45:30,wallstreetbets,I just don't even watch anymore. I have alerts for when the prices reach a certain amount. Watching otherwise will just weaken my resolve.
2021-04-09 14:46:18,wallstreetbets,What’s a dip 🤤🦧
2021-04-09 14:46:37,wallstreetbets,"I bought one share of gme at 315, and sold when it hit 80 in February. Tried actually investing, just lost more money. So l sold it all, bought back in at 160, and I’m holding because I wouldn’t be making money anyway"
2021-04-09 14:48:36,wallstreetbets,Dips bring ups
2021-04-09 14:48:46,wallstreetbets,pretty much sums me up right now lol
2021-04-09 14:49:02,wallstreetbets,Good time to buy y'all.
2021-04-09 14:49:41,wallstreetbets,Wife telling me to slow down. I'm buying every week no matter the price. If is on sale I buy MORE!!
2021-04-09 14:50:27,wallstreetbets,"If you check YouTube live channels the chat is full of people saying ""gme is done"" and ""I sold amc"" bruh that shit scares no one"
2021-04-09 14:50:46,wallstreetbets,Yeap
2021-04-09 14:50:47,wallstreetbets,"I've always appreciated the cinematography in that final scene in PotC:AWE.  The railing, where his hand was a moment before, just exploding behind him as he walks through his imminent demise."
2021-04-09 14:52:40,wallstreetbets,It always dips on Friday and goes up on Monday
2021-04-09 14:53:05,wallstreetbets,Ryan Cohen is gonna become chairman?

2021-04-09 14:55:23,wallstreetbets,"I am so unfazed, why can't I be this cool about other things in my life?"
2021-04-09 14:55:24,wallstreetbets,"Lol I'm negative on my AMC and I was like, meh fuck it. Got them diamond hands so I won't break."
2021-04-09 14:55:28,wallstreetbets,"New dip, new buy. Adding 30 shares!"
2021-04-09 14:56:07,wallstreetbets,"It's even less scary because of how obvious this is.  Ryan becomes chairman and it goes down?  Shortly after they've borrowed millions of shares?

They've been planning this for a while.  Knew it was coming.  This is their salvo to suppress the stock, and it's already rising again.  This is just going to keep happening because they can't keep it down for long, but they can't let it rise, either, so it'll cat and mouse until their wheels fall off and it streaks away."

2021-04-09 14:59:12,wallstreetbets,"Im going to drop some wisdom on my fellow apes.

You know Who was found to be the GREATEST stock traders?

It wasn’t the hedge funds, it Wasn’t the billionaires or the politicians.

It was two types of people.

Those who were dead and Those who forgot the password to their investment accounts.

That’s right. It has NOTHING to do with timing the market. It’s about time IN the market.

2021-04-09 14:59:28,wallstreetbets,I just want it to go lower so I can buy more!!!

2021-04-09 15:06:12,wallstreetbets,That scene in 1917 is one of the greatest ever filmed
2021-04-09 15:06:23,wallstreetbets,"I find it funny that every time I google GME to see the price there is a new article for a ""serious"" site saying that ""its over"" or how it will no longer work. I guess its being over for about 2 months"
2021-04-09 15:06:39,wallstreetbets,I am already numb to these dips
2021-04-09 15:07:28,wallstreetbets,I'm buying more if this keeps up thats for DAMN sure!

2021-04-09 15:16:47,wallstreetbets,"January: NOOO!!! IT’S DIPPED BY 5!!!

April: lmao it went down 100. Dw it’ll go up"
2021-04-09 15:18:00,wallstreetbets,Wait til GME double digits before you post that LOL
2021-04-09 15:18:20,wallstreetbets,"What’s a dip other than a buying opportunity. Our retardation, err, our will, knows no bounds."
2021-04-09 15:18:26,wallstreetbets,Do you guys even check on the price anymore?
2021-04-09 15:18:43,wallstreetbets,"I have 3g’s left from work stock plan, hoping it dips to 150 so I can dump the rest in!"
2021-04-09 15:20:49,wallstreetbets,"I bought more

2021-04-09 15:25:23,wallstreetbets,What will happen during the may dips.?
2021-04-09 15:25:34,wallstreetbets,"Ahuuuuuuu Strong Apes

2021-04-09 15:26:18,wallstreetbets,And here I am still holding
2021-04-09 15:27:17,wallstreetbets,"So if dark pools don't affect the price of the stock what's to stop them from covering their shorts in dark pools, I just have the distinct feeling that we are getting fucked in the ass"
2021-04-09 15:27:21,wallstreetbets,Bought one yesterday at 170 and another today at 158.
2021-04-09 15:27:32,wallstreetbets,"I mean it’s just good business am I right guys?

I’ll leave...."
2021-04-09 15:27:45,wallstreetbets,"I bought at all prices during this Fridays dip, this shit is nothing."
2021-04-09 15:27:57,wallstreetbets,This was hardly even a dip lol
2021-04-09 15:28:59,wallstreetbets,"My friend put me onto etc. was gazing at my shares of GME just wondering if I had the balls to give in now. So I unzipped, couldn’t find nothing. Became too cold from these *Diamond hands* bb"

2021-04-09 15:31:13,wallstreetbets,What dip?
2021-04-09 15:32:30,wallstreetbets,This is how you're supposed to see investment. Dippies are just sales on your future fortune.
2021-04-09 15:33:57,wallstreetbets,It’s just good business...
2021-04-09 15:34:28,wallstreetbets,I love this. It's so true.
2021-04-09 15:35:00,wallstreetbets,"Feels good, I bought one new share today for 160. Feel so ape and happy 😄"
2021-04-09 15:35:08,wallstreetbets,29 @ $162 been averaging down thanks to hedgie-san. Arigato Mr. Roboto.
2021-04-09 15:46:18,wallstreetbets,Guys is it an addiction already? Cos the only dips I can think of are bodyweight triceps exercises
2021-04-09 15:47:01,wallstreetbets,"I feel like the only reaction I have now, rather we go up or down, it just 'huh'"
2021-04-09 15:48:49,wallstreetbets,"Ya for real, if I saw my account dip like this 1-2 months ago I’d actually be concerned and now I just look at it and I’m like...”yup, probably a good time to pick up some more”"

2021-04-09 15:50:40,wallstreetbets,True. At this point I'll probably just keep holding until I completely forget I'm holding until... I hear about the moon landing on Reddit after it fucking happens.
2021-04-09 15:50:47,wallstreetbets,Im laying on a claymore for y’all!
2021-04-09 15:53:14,wallstreetbets,Youre even looking?
2021-04-09 15:53:31,wallstreetbets,I haven't looked at my account for more than week. I am fully desensitized.
2021-04-09 15:53:47,wallstreetbets,This is me all the way!  I don’t have much more but I sold  some of my other stocks and and added 20 more today.
2021-04-09 15:53:57,wallstreetbets,I bought my first gme share the 1st of February. I saw -86% on my savings. Those April dips hurt me like a small sausage trying to rape a black hole.

2021-04-09 15:59:43,wallstreetbets,I think of my GME (and AMC) stocks as a ride that I bought a ticket to. I have no idea what's going on but I'm having fun and I get to yell WHEEEEE every once in a while.
2021-04-09 16:01:44,wallstreetbets,so true... added 40 more AMC today got total of 350

2021-04-09 16:22:56,wallstreetbets,"thank you, taylor swift"
2021-04-09 16:24:52,wallstreetbets,There was a dip?

I bet they’ll try harder Monday, but if retail keeps scooping them up, they’re going to be in deep shit."

2021-04-09 16:48:03,wallstreetbets,Facts. I just bought a fuck ton of shares today cos of how cheap the price was. Oh yeah I just realised I lowered my average cost too. Yep. Today’s been a good day. When it comes to apes. It’s always a win-win in the market. If it goes up = tendies. If it goes down = more GME shares at a bargain so even more gains when it rockets. Trading sideways = shorts having to pay interest and losing out cash. OOH OOH AAH AAH AAH I AINT HERE NO BELL 💎🦍🦍

When it dropped that first day I was so tempted to paperhand and cut my losses, but I held on and the next day things were looking much better. Since then I’ve learned to relax and let the market do what it does. I buy more when the price dips and I hold when it rises. These aren’t shares to me any more; they’re collectibles that will only increase in value, squeeze or no squeeze. Why? Because I like the stock! Some of my shares will never be sold even after the rocket launches, because I believe this is a good investment and the company has a good long-term outlook. But what do I know? I’m just a retard."

2021-04-09 18:07:13,wallstreetbets,"IKR!! 

Nailed the 153.00 dip on the schnozz somehow today for another 100 shares.  

Then I got cocky and tried to nail 154 but missed and hit 155.27 for another 100. 

GF is still bug eyed after she saw my Positions screen.  lol 

""Honey...you said you wouldn't buy as much as you had in Round 1.  That says you have three times as many shares now"" She said

""Yup....I lied my ass off, Sweetie and I am gonna keep doing it.""  Then I ducked."

2021-04-09 16:07:31,wallstreetbets,"I mean I already lost so much money already that it isn't even real anymore. Go up 1.5%, go down 5%, repeat. 

Do I cut my losses?  ""Oh no, the stock market is all about patience"" people say. Well, fuck. At an average return of 7% a year, I guess I'll get back to even in 6 years"

Big thing is I didn't put in more money than I could afford to lose. In December DDs said ""be ready to lose 90% of what you put in"", and after looking into it myself I assessed the risk, agreed, and got myself into this."
2021-04-09 12:48:32,wallstreetbets,lol it’s very funny how you say “invested” in GME

We’ve been primed for it, we’ve all seen what happened in 2008 and there’s plenty of movies that detail what went on behind the scenes and who profited. The mentality of screw the hedgies is really about screw the corrupted system that leads to these boom and bust cycles that represent huge transfers of wealth, that’s how it appears to me anyway.

2021-04-09 13:39:28,wallstreetbets,"""most people"" ""most folks"" ""most people"" 

Interesting that you make these statements like they are facts and not just your opinion. You're speaking for a lot of people based on... what exactly? If this was any other stock and a normal situation, I might actually agree. But this isn't a normal situation, everyone paying attention knows that. I've had plenty of chances to take meagre profits, but I meant it when I said moon or bust. Hedgies can suck my left nut."
2021-04-09 13:45:23,wallstreetbets,"""Most people"", ""Most folks"" ..like you have any actual information. Have you been surveying the entirety of the GME shareholders? I call bullshit on your generalizations which you cannot possibly back up."

2021-04-09 13:36:55,wallstreetbets,I have plenty of back left. Secure employment - even during economic depressions. I'll increase my position as long as they want. Of course this is not financial advice. It is however advice to hedgies to watch out - cuz I fuck.

2021-04-09 16:20:02,wallstreetbets,Maybe. Or maybe it has something to do with the 7000 call options that would have been in the money had it stayed at 200. you know market makers wanting to make money and all.
2021-04-09 18:23:25,wallstreetbets,Melvin Capital just reported a 49% loss into the quarter. Interesting
2021-04-09 14:24:13,wallstreetbets,"https://finviz.com/map.ashx

Looks pretty green to me dude. Volume is higher in the last 5 months than it has been in 12 years. Diminishing from those highs in inflows is not an apocalypse if you're not investing like a complete retard. No qualms if you recognize it, but no,  FAANG isn't propping up the entire market."
2021-04-09 16:12:48,wallstreetbets,How is aiming to ruin people's lives peaceful? There are people who work for those hedge firms that are just like you and me.

2021-04-09 15:29:12,wallstreetbets,You need to stop thinking of it in terms of a one shot short squeeze and think of it as investing in the (fragile) future of a company (that hasn't met a revenue target in the last nine quarters).
2021-04-09 14:32:54,wallstreetbets,Is a planet.
2021-04-09 14:45:36,wallstreetbets,THIS IS THE FUCKING WAY because you and I both know our GME shares are worth north of a million once we turn off the market manipulation

2021-04-09 15:15:52,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, it’s not as amazing as people make it out to be. If not giving a fuck is a completely unknown concept to you and you have a habit of giving wayyyy too many fucks, then it’s probably a decent read. It’s easily read and it’s not heavy at all, but it’s not revolutionary or anything like that. I genuinely tried to get through it, but I just had to put it back down because I kept going “well.. yeah.. duh” in my head."

2021-04-09 13:55:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that was the decision early on. I also have some faith in Gamestop as a brand, if they can do the reformation well. Even if this short squeeze shit wasn't happening, I'd still hold onto my shares for a long while. Shifting to ecommerce won't happen overnight."
2021-04-09 17:59:49,wallstreetbets,This is the way.

2021-04-09 13:58:02,wallstreetbets,"Oh, yeah no that was just hyperbole. I mean, if in a year or two Gamestop fails to shift well to ecommerce and ends up bankrupt again, yeah the stock will disappear. I can't imagine them coming back from another failure like that.

But yeah, based on news I've seen about the company, I think there's a chance for them to reinvent the brand and become very successful."

2021-04-09 15:01:53,wallstreetbets,"Nope, talking about call options."
2021-04-09 15:53:29,wallstreetbets,"Options are THE casino rules of investing.

They are way more complicated than what I am going to describe, but they are basically bets about the shares price going higher or lower.

If someone bets that it's going to raise, they are called calls; if the bet is for the shares dropping, then puts. You pay someone to create the contract, with the price you think is going to reach and the time it will do so.

The additional details so you don't go bankrupt is that the contract  indicates that you are buying/selling 100 shares (per contract) at a specific date, so be careful with them and don't put your money on them without further investigation.

Me ape, this is not advice or proper info."

2021-04-09 16:24:32,wallstreetbets,"Wow give me a break, AND they are the ones doing illegal shit. literally who cares. Nobody is hurting anyone we are buying stocks in the market. Im not ""Aiming"" to hurt someone's life i'm trying to make money."

I doubt they’d want to ruin the lives of the employees of gamestop by shorting it into the ground, either. Once the dust settles, anyone who is out of a job will be able to find employment elsewhere, no matter how it all plays out, would be my hope."
2021-04-09 17:10:22,wallstreetbets,"I think GME is just a cult at this point without any real value, but individuals who work for hedgefunds aren’t people."

Social anxiety was a huge problem for me (along with a host of other things), and Manson's book helped me realize that I was far exceeding my quota of fucks each day, leaving me feeling burnt out. I won't say it changed my life (or that it was 'revolutionary' either), but it sure helped A LOT. :)"
2021-04-09 16:17:54,wallstreetbets,I couldn't do it either. I did genuinely enjoy Unfuck Yourself though. I listened to it as an audiobook and the angry scottish accent just sort of adds something to it.

I tried to buy around $45 after the first huge crash, and Fiedlity also scared me away, but I ended up not buying anything.. now I got no GME and no ticket to the moon, but I bought an apes together strong shirt with the diamond hands to support them and the movement you all did here.

2021-04-09 16:07:42,wallstreetbets,"I didn't even know about it until the first peak, joined wsb, tried to figure out what app to use. Started on cash app, couldn't buy gme, so i got amc. That tanked, only spent 100 on it so i didn't feel too bad. Got fidelity, couldn't transfer money from my bank, had to take a picture of a check i wrote to myself just to put money in,  had to wait a week to buy anything. My amc was steadily dropping, so my faith was low in all this,  only been here a few weeks at that point. Bought 2 gmes at 50. A few days later bought 2 more at 40. Maybe a week later it popped back up. I should have had more faith in you guys, woulda coulda shoulda. Anyway currently up to 47 shares, transferred some more for Monday."
2021-04-09 14:33:06,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they did stop purchasing after all, but it sounds like you were trying to buy without settled funds."
2021-04-09 13:49:52,wallstreetbets,At least your average is probably about the same as the peak buyers who averaged down after.
2021-04-09 13:31:23,wallstreetbets,"Kind of similar to me, bought at 110, sold at 60 bc I listened to other people and got scared. bought at 80, 120 and 180. Im still holding!"

2021-04-09 16:23:09,wallstreetbets,E-commerce for games is such a saturated market. Gamestop is a huge late comer to the market.
2021-04-09 13:59:50,wallstreetbets,I just think buying stock to specifically f over hedgefunds and rich people is dumb. If you have family in the company then awesome. By all means buy it. I just don't get the obsession on this sub with throwing their entire life savings into one stock.
2021-04-09 13:47:54,wallstreetbets,This is the way

2021-04-09 19:02:50,wallstreetbets,"Do it! It's super easy. If you are confident and bullish, pick an even higher strike price for more premium! 

I think GME is going to be back around $25 by next year, but to each their own. It's fun how in the market, we can literally 'put our money where our mouth is' and if we are right, get paid for it!

The meme is in response to the current price drops in the stock.

If you don’t think that is due to retail investors selling in response to price drops and other sources or financial advice.

Then you believe the drops are calculated efforts made by institutional investors in an effort to manipulate stock price or keep stock price at a given level.

My point is that I buck the idea that everyone here are diamond hands... if you were the price wouldn’t be dropping.

If everyone in this sub were doing what they claim to be doing, holding and buying, then retail investors total equity % would be increasing... it isn’t. So you have to assume there are far more paper hands in this sub than the constant barrage of memes would suggest."
2021-04-09 14:02:49,wallstreetbets,"So let me make this clear. People who do not claim to be financial advisors need to shut up?

So we can delete 99% of the bullshit posted in this sub where people specifically claim they are NOT financial advisors... but continue to give advice anyway.

You can tweak his spreadsheet to create your one and the current valuation is disjointed from reality.

Eventually, I had 200 shares and got out before the squeeze. I am super happy for other people making a killing, but I will feel empathy to those people who blow up.

One thing I do believe in is doing your own research and sticking to your thesis.

The only thing I have been doing with GME was selling options when the IV was like 500%.

I broke even on a leveraged AMC position by selling covered calls.

I could make 495$ with max losses of about 500 dollars selling 5 dollar spreads on Gme like 200$ away from the strike.

This is Wallstreet Bets, so I know risk adjusted returns is the name of the game, but not really a huge part of the sub.

No way GME is at $25 next year. ""The offering"" as you put it is also optional at the company's discretion and from time to time. It's 3.5mm shares for a max funding of $1bil. $1bil ÷ 3.5mm = $285.71. The company believes its share price to be worth at least $285.71 before they issue more shares.

No way it's at $25 in a year. Even if they issued 3.5mm shares the float is so low as fuck, and those shares do fuck all to dilute it."

And all those hedge funds have had [plenty of time to cover their shorts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/hedge-fund-maplelane-is-clawing-way-back-from-gamestop-losses). And they'll have more opportunity with the $1B offering.

The fact that Melvin Capital reported a loss of *only* 49% proves they have the capital to cover their remaining shorts. The squeeze is dead.

The only conversation left is will Cohen's transformation succeed in hitting a revenue target which will determine if GME will stay above $100 or under $20.

The problem is that people use the fact that it's an ""outlier"" as a catchall to predict the most insane price targets and conspiracy theories. The finance world is complex enough for almost anyone to build a narrative out of.  I think it's very likely that at these prices for $GME, you're paying a significant premium for misinformation and conspiracy theories that have no basis in reality. Also Ryan Cohen looks like a goober. 

>Is the SPY a safer bet? Absolutely.
>Will the SPY turn you into an overnight millionaire? Not a fucking chance.

The stock market very rarely makes people into overnight millionaires with small amounts of original costs. Time is the factor that matters most. You might not like to hear it, but GME won't turn you into an overnight millionaire at these levels either. 

>Both bets have risk - just because one doesn't align with your personal risk tolerance is perfectly fine.

I mean yeah, but that's like saying brass knuckles and nuclear weapons are both dangerous. It's a meaningless statement for making decisions to say that they both have risks."

This was exploited by some investors, but to think that they are not capable of either hedging or doing something about it is basically insanity.

I recognize as a retail trader, I am at a relative information disadvantage and need to focus on intrinsic valuation and research to develop sound thesis.

There might be nefarious activities that go on and ""yes"" it shouldn't happen.

Naked shorting, fake shares, failure to delivers, but it's not the hill to die on.

You can take ""gambly"" positions long short seeking returns, but its super important to be a little diversified, so that you don't get ""knocked out"" of the game.

There are so many ways to make strong yields. The amount of capital destroyed made buying Faggy D's is astounding. Even if you have a high risk profile. Or people who don't even know the criteria of their ""win conditions"". These people might be millionaires and have more money than ill ever have, but one of my goals is to not go broke.

Options are dangerous because you need more variables correct. I make way more consistent money just selling options. You can day trade that with normal situations and hedge when you are wrong.

I have destroyed plenty of capital a few years back and don't want others to go through that. I had the mentality of yolo then, but its tough to go through when you get a few wrong in a row."

2021-04-09 17:39:02,wallstreetbets,GME is a bad investment and the real money is world is betting against it and going to beat you. Ya dummies.

Such a ridiculous, weird relationship you guys have with a fucking security. Why do you pile into something like this and just expect everyone to march in lockstep with you?"
2021-04-09 17:04:56,wallstreetbets,"Why? Because I have a different view of the situation than you do? You don't like that I'm calling out the people who are doing this not to invest, but to cause monetary harm?"

2021-04-09 12:46:46,wallstreetbets,"Nice work on this.  I really enjoy reading your DDs.

I'm pretty dumb about this kind of stuff and a lot of other things, so forgive this basic question.

Please help me understand the math here about volume.  According to Yahoo Finance, avg, daily volume for NEE is almost 10M which is almost 800M per day.  so how does $400M equate to 30 days of trading?"
2021-04-09 12:28:45,wallstreetbets,shoutout to Jerrick McKinnon for getting me -0.1 points in fantasy last season and then not getting a touch for the rest of the game.

2021-04-09 16:04:35,wallstreetbets,"I could have explained that better.  I don't mean total shares traded on the desk for the company as a whole.  I mean it's 30 days of Blackrock volume, because they're not going to buy it all at once."
2021-04-09 15:39:59,wallstreetbets,"That's where you op lost me as well. They'll buy \~half a daily trading volume in shares. I re-read and thought maybe you meant 400 million shares, but that's $31B which is \~5.5X more than ICLN manages."

2021-04-09 11:49:23,wallstreetbets,9% is still better than keeping it in a savings account or putting it in a cd and letting the bank use it. Don’t listen to this guy.
2021-04-09 13:31:29,wallstreetbets,overnight. lmfao
2021-04-09 11:55:03,wallstreetbets,9% so far is pretty good considering of late the market has been pretty poopy

2021-04-09 12:37:02,wallstreetbets,"I agree. This is only an enthusiasm based price as of now. If anything bad or unstable happens, this is going to crash faster than anything. 

It has so much downward pressure, and I might expect to see a bump on the way down (as more try to take advantage of the enthusiasm) but when that bottom lets out she is goin’ kerplunk to the bottom of the well."

2021-04-09 12:39:23,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they will. And soon here this trend is going to die off. It always happens. What goes up must come down. Some might buy in as it meets support levels, but when all that support gives out this is going to crash, and fast. 

Stupid money is not all that makes up this inflation, I doubt any huge investors will buy back in at $45 expecting healthy growth / a big spike. This already spiked twice. By now, it’s just beating a dead horse.

The price target is still $25. I think we will see that at the tail end of this year."
2021-04-09 18:57:20,wallstreetbets,Yeah I misread
2021-04-09 18:53:14,wallstreetbets,Will make sure to do that for the next update.
2021-04-09 12:13:18,wallstreetbets,"Good point. However, in the end, it won't matter what the price does today.  

In addition, lots of things have changed since that price point."
2021-04-09 17:04:44,wallstreetbets,If price is 50$ the market cap would be less than the POSITIVE CASH they have. At 420 per share it's undervalued. You do you good luck with your short position :)

2021-04-09 12:48:09,wallstreetbets,You're probably right. I thought I was being bullish with $45.00.

2021-04-09 18:54:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, no worries I approved it seeing I fucked up.  There was a lot to remove because I think no one watched new for a few hours, was going through and apparently made a mistake for yours, it happens."
2021-04-09 12:17:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the price for now is pretty flat with a downward trend. People in this sub talk a lot of about diamond hands, but when panic sets in is when it falls...half of them don't understand about lowering their cost basis, and how it's a multiplier.

2021-04-09 14:19:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, people here seem to have gone full QAnon to a large degree, with the MOASS coming SOON. Just like Q's STORM. It's a bit unsettling. Like; there is almost no volume on GME anymore, it's just slowly fizzling out because no large buyers are jumping in to get it going again. 

Also, short interest seems to have plummeted after the 350 rise and dip, so that might be a reason whales are staying away with no short squeeze possible any longer."
2021-04-09 12:46:37,wallstreetbets,"This is why you all still believe GME is doomed and will miss the opportunity. FFS, do some research!  

1) management overhaul  
2) e-commerce ramp up

2021-04-09 12:48:18,wallstreetbets,"Those are reasons that fair value is now $25 instead of $5 - but in no way do those facts support a share price of $160 lol.

Chewy: $2 billion revenue. (51% of US sales)

GameStop: $62 million revenue.

2021-04-09 14:21:02,wallstreetbets,Chewy revenue was 4.8 billion for 2020. Roblox revenue was only 920 million for 2020. Gamestop was also 6.5 billion for 2020.

Slack merger is big and imo the pullback was an overreaction and they're likely going to continue to kill earnings in June. Goldman Sachs conviction list is also reassuring (though their historical performance is.... not amazing).

Absolutely nothing wrong with taking profits to rebalance your portfolio though, I do it all the time. If it'd help your mental taking out the initial investment can be good too (though tends to be a more psychological strat than anything else)"

13 years later, tech has advanced so much. Data and metrics have advanced so much. AI and ML has advanced so much and so many more people are interconnected and are just smarter as a result of having info at their finger tips. It's not so fucking easy to rape the market. I mean it's still easy to get away with it, cause the SEC sucks donkey dick at enforcing rules and laws in a way where the penalty of the crime is not cost of business; currently it is.

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD on Coupang and why it can it can moon As you may have known CPNG recently IPO'd with the valuation of about $35, leading many to believe that the stock price is currently overvalued. I've taken a quick look at this company along with $SE and I'm bullish on CPNG. What I expect is for this company to demonstrate to the market what theoretical saturation really looks like.

My reasons:

1. South Korea is a considerably large, dense, wealthy country with income equality. Wealth equality is overlooked when comparing Asia. e-commerce stores themselves thrive on middle-income participants. There is no comparison in Asia.

&#x200B;

2) Their lifestyles are extremely busy compared to the rest of the world and the tradeoff for money over convenience is likely going to create a flywheel effect. G-Market is considered the cheaper option to Coupang for now, but as volume increases, prices are likely to fall.

&#x200B;

3) Companies in S Korea, unlike SEA or China, are extremely ""Chaebol"". The large brick and mortar retailers have historically marked up their products. The standard was to sell something for multiple times MSRP Lately they have been getting destroyed by e-commerce and most of the e-commerce is being destroyed by Coupang. Ebay Korea has been looking to sell their position in the market for a fraction of the valuation of Coupang, but nobody is interested in buying. The number of competitors mean nothing.

&#x200B;

4) Coupang owns the entire supply chain, up and down. They own the inventory and they own the drivers and warehouses. Their algorithms are extremely good as well and it is catered to the Korea audience. As they gain control of this market and crush out the competition, Coupang will have significantly more pricing power. Their Amazon Price subscription is mere $2.5 USD a month.

&#x200B;

5) Receiving $4.6 billion dollars in cash is absolutely insane, given that we've been able to see how far they have been able to stretch the $3 billion from SoftBank.

&#x200B;

6) Coupang has demonstrate the deepest ability to monetize their consumers in the market. $SE has leaned on its extremely profitable gaming arm Garena to fuel infrastructure. But market depth and consumer service quality is unparalleled. Consumers trust Coupang enough to buy groceries on a daily basis.

&#x200B;

7) This company trades a significant discount to its peers for a few reasons, the lack of an AWS-like product. The reality is, Coupang is currently deploying the $4 billion dollars to tack on higher margin technology services. If you look at the second revenue line, the other sources of income is currently small, but growing rapidly.  The company looks poised to completely control a passive, wealthy and easily marked up audience upselling them on a wide range of products unheard of in other e-commerce platforms. Once that objective is completed, their services become exponentially more valuable.

&#x200B;

8) Currently sales are $11 billion dollars, looking to trend to $22 billion in sales for next year. Best Buy currently trades at $16 billion in sales and is roughly $30 billion, which is roughly about what Coupang trades in line at (\~ currently priced at $50 billion but adding on a much faster growth rate would place the company north of that line, $80 billion is rich but reasonable). The key thing is that adding additional product lines has been very easy. Kroger alone has about $60 billion in perishable food sales and Coupang is the only e-commerce company in the world to really have controlled this type of market. Companies with no foothold in grocery stores are likely never going to have that going forward. Purchases by parents are built on an immense level of trust and are not price sensitive. Chewy sells pet food (another super insensitive purchase category). There's a lot of $$$ to be made here.

&#x200B;

9) The owner is relatively good at pivoting and one hell of an operator so realistically you will not be able to buy the stock before the news comes out when they find their best new hot thing to drop $4.6 billion on. The best thing to do is wait for this stock to trade sideways for a while and pick up what you can while the narrative is focused on the inability to leave their home country (which ultimately will be the story for every e-commerce investment).

&#x200B;

10) Hostility to Coupang being unable to enter other spaces is overblown, other than general hatred for Chinese and the Japanese having hatred for specifically Koreans and humorous hatred for foreigers who don't take the time to learn a culture, there is no reason why Coupang can't compete in SEA. I've never seen this level of market domination in a competitive environment with reasonable profitability outside of Amazon. $SE has the advantage of Blue Skies and SEA gamer boys, but nobody can club heads like Coupang.

(But also kinda hoping the market crashes in the meantime so I can load up on the bottom.) Definitely one of the main few companies I wanna load up heavily in when the market doesn’t feel so overpriced again. (The others being AMD, WKHS, CRSR, PLTR, and AGTC.)

2021-04-09 14:08:02,wallstreetbets,No competitive moat
2021-04-09 11:33:15,wallstreetbets,"Doordash is in a competitive market where the population is sparsely spread out, killing profitability. They compete against a bigger player, UBER in a winner takes most enviroment. They don't own the infrastructure, they just pay drivers and handle the logistics. The value proposition doesn't justify the costs of transportation through someone's aging sedan. 

Here, the company is moving trucks of high-value products for about 7 miles to a demographic that values quality and speed and is willing to pay a significant premium for it (S. Koreans use to pay 2x or 3x for their products before e-commerce). Selling fruit for example produces is about gross margins 12% for wholesalers and 50% for retailers. Most of those costs come from waste as inventory is mismanged and expires. There is no competition in this area for the foreseeable future. What I expect is that the market will be caught off guard by profitability. Perhaps Coupang will be limited to their home country, perhaps not, culturally Korea and Korean products in general are very popular (KPOP etc) and has been a global phenomon and a luxury or quality e-commerce brand doesn't really exist in Asia. I'm not sure if there will be the same level of pushback that everyone is expecting. When I buy from BABA I have to double-check if the factory making the product even exists (no fault to them ofc)."

2021-04-09 13:16:42,wallstreetbets,This is my short term play but after the next big spike I'm going to roll RKT into the Rocket Labs spac and ride the volatility of that for my CCs. If Rocket Lab doesn't hit $100 a share by end of year I will eat my hat!
2021-04-09 12:36:30,wallstreetbets,I've got both.
2021-04-09 10:58:08,wallstreetbets,"""hypothetically"" if one is to own 100 shares of a stock they can sell a call option against those shares.

General idea is you sell a call option that is really far away from the strike and usually will expire worthless.....if it doesn't you get to sell your shares at said strike so its a win win (you get the call price paid to you plus the stock sale).

If done right you can go.....forever just making ""interest"" on the insurance you sell against your stock.....as stock appreciates over the years say to 100 or 150$ per share on a hypothetical stock....said person could sell 1 contract for every 100 shares they own and collect the premium or as I like to say ""insurance"" payments on your stock."
2021-04-09 15:12:49,wallstreetbets,CC = covered call
2021-04-09 13:18:02,wallstreetbets,RKT for life for me

2021-04-09 12:35:23,wallstreetbets,I like this play
2021-04-09 17:27:28,wallstreetbets,So you'd sell RKT CC for like 100 C? Are you usually doing short term or long term contracts?

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

If you've made it this far, thank you for being a valuable part of a community that's grown incredibly quickly over the past few months."

2021-04-09 11:32:10,wallstreetbets,"Huh, this actually does make me feel better about all of my calls that are expiring today $5-10 OTM.

I accidentally bought a 4/9 190C on GME for 600 at open on Tuesday (high of day). Ended up another 5 contracts deep as I tried to make it work. 

Went from an immediate $200 loss if I just sold back contract, but I could have exited during open yesterday for a small profit. Instead I'm now down 80% on 2.8k in trying to average down my position. God damnit.

Thanks for the loss porn."
2021-04-09 11:44:10,wallstreetbets,Stop buying calls. Just get shares already

2021-04-09 12:46:27,wallstreetbets,"I'm in a similar boat with AMC. Smaller scale only 9 calls but I got them at the 14 dollar peak. That money is gone. Unless we go to the moon before next Friday. But, I did just snap up 100 more AMC @ 9.45. Thanks Hedgies you taught me that I can't time the market. Buy, Hold, Work, repeat. Until the apes take **all your tendies** on their trip to the moon. If they can drive GME lower I might be able to afford more of that too."

2021-04-09 14:05:47,wallstreetbets,I used to feel bad for these guys but now i dont. Im in on gme and its said every single day not to buy calls because it helps the HF and the reward isnt worth the risk loss to reward on these call prices. And yet theres these posts every day hoping to be the next DFV. They'll never learn.
2021-04-09 12:59:01,wallstreetbets,Now this is funny and I was thinking of buying calls for 200 strike but was like nah 😂😂😂😂
2021-04-09 14:30:00,wallstreetbets,and yet somehow this idiot managed to save 90k at some point.  unbelieveable

2021-04-09 11:39:31,wallstreetbets,I've done nothing but make money off of GME. My bad that you either didnt buy it at all and thus are sodium chloride or you bought at the top and panic sold thus are intellectually crippled in addition to being salty.

2021-04-09 14:31:45,wallstreetbets,"Lol, imagine being on WSB and saying ""don't buy calls."" Just stop. At least this person is a hero and put their money where their mouth is. You're just a sheep who is falling for the scam.

GME is not an investment. It is a gamble that is making people a shit ton of money. That being said, these strikes OP bought calls at are really stupid. But that could've also been said for all those weeks where every single strike on the options chain paid out. Hold and diamond hand are instructions for the ape army to drive the price up while the traders make money (including these ""hedgies"" that you hate so much). Just think about it. If you're an APE, the only way **YOU** win is if you don't diamond hand and sell. But if your only strategy is to keep buying on the way up (or baghold or buy more on the way down) then your gains are hugely capped. 

The people who actually win big are one of the following: degenerate gamblers buying OTM calls (OP), institutions/insiders with large long holdings of GME (not you), traders who are smart enough to sell options for the obscene premiums (not you either). And this is where the scam part comes in because the immediate response is something along the lines of ""I'll win big when GME hits $10,000 per share!!!"" Don't need to explain that one cause IYKYK..."

2021-04-09 16:47:53,wallstreetbets,Congrats on starting your journey! Couple pro tips to get you started: make sure you always buy at least 10% out of the money and pick the nearest expiration. This allows you to limit your cost and maximize your gains. Good luck and happy trading 👍

With that being said I bought GME not because of the chance of a squeeze ... but because it looks like a great investment over a 1-2 year period.  What with them trimming all the fat / replacing all the senior leadership with professionals who are best in class in their field / all the directors are only getting paid in shares.... so the price of the stock directly correlates to how much they get paid.

What salt are you speaking of?

If you're asking me why I bothered commenting on OPs comment the answer is really simple:

I felt like it. I find it funny that OPs talking about all the people who lost money when last I checked the only people who have lost money are people who would have lost money on any security by buying at the top and people who played FDs... which is pretty much expected.

My point is - the fact OP is saying something that is objectively true 99.9% of the time - so why's it matter if we're talking GME or not. OP is talking about GME as if GME is the reason people lost money when the real reason is they made shit trades and likely would've done so regardless of the security."

Buying GME either way is a losing bet now. it was a GREAT money making play for the smart people that played it smartly(see: early and part of the either the first or second pumps and also part of the first and second dumps)

Nothing but bagholders left now

Shares that go to $50/60 would maintain some value where the option would not, true.

There is nothing wrong with options and WSB was literally built on options huge gain potential and loss porn.

In the future you will understand that these apes (you if you are holding GME) have been used as a bagholder while the WSB OG's have already cashed out TWICE or MORE for fat stacks of cash.

End of March/April we have been seeing a lot of low volume(extremely low volumes) and days of side way trades, which is kind of strange in itself. However, it's even more interesting to note we have been slowly falling for the last week now.

I have a concern the shorts changed up their strategy to make us paper hand. They probably latched onto the idea that the price plummeting seem too artifical to us so we knew the stock was being manipulated.

I believe their goal now is to simulate a slow fall to make us believe people are paper handing.

NOTE: It's funny how it skyrockets during premarket and backs to dipping every day now - only to skyrocket again during premarket

The fund rose 6.5% in February and 2.1% in March, according to people familiar with the matter, and ended the first quarter with a loss of 39.5%. The fund benefited from its long and short wagers on technology and consumer-focused companies, one of the people said.

In January, Maplelane’s short on GameStop and American Airlines Group Inc. backfired as Reddit-fueled retail investors drove up the price of the companies. The fund has since closed out those positions.

Maplelane has made money in 14 of the past 15 months, one of the people said.

The $3 billion New York-based firm, run by Leon Shaulov and Rob Crespi, declined to comment.

2021-04-09 09:14:23,wallstreetbets,"Good Morning Apes, for those of you who have Webull shares, i contacted them yesterday in regards to the recall shares date and to verify that my shares are ready to go for the upcoming June meeting this is what they said when i asked them about my account:

Me: I would like to know what will be the process to cast my vote for the shareholders meeting for GME, could you please give me some information as to how Webull will handle this vote?

Webull: If you currently hold GME you will qualify for the upcoming shotckholder meeting as long as you are a holder of record. Currently the record date has not yet been announced(which is now 6/9/2021), however the shareholder meeting has an anticipated date of June 9th. Whether you are in the fully paid lending program or not has no effect on your voting rights, and you will receive your proxy control number to your email on file in order to vote as long as you are stockholder of record.

Me: Thank you very much for this info, so just to confirm, my account is a cash account right? So does this mean that i have recall my shares, my understanding is no since i paid cash for them is that correct?

Webull: Yes, you have a cash account. You do not have to recall shares because you paid for them. You do own the shares.

&#x200B;

So things to consider, be absolutely 100% that your account is a cash account and on Webull, if you have the mobile app do the following to opt out of the lending program by going to:

&#x200B;

Click the webull logo in the middle

Click the More four square logo

Click Stock Lending Income Program and then opt out, it will change your status to Under Review.

Hope this helps out some of you who are on webull"

If you have shares that are loaned out, recall them immediately. If you are unsure, contact your broker and make sure your shares are not loaned out. If they are make sure you can get them back and opt out of lending if you can. Otherwise you won't be able to vote at the annual meeting. Here's some information on what I know:

RH or eToro - You're screwed. They lend your share out, you have no control. Maybe they are nice and get it back for you so you can proxy vote but I am betting not... Maybe try to contact them, good luck with that...

Fidelity - Fully Paid Lending, must have $250k in assets, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

ETrade - Fully Paid Lending, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

IB - Stock Yield Enhancement Program, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall your shares.

Webull - Stock Lending Income Plan, must opt in, they pick stocks to short, you must leave the program to get stocks back unless they are returned. You should probably contact them.

Schwab - Securities Lending Program, must apply, shares become part of a fund or something? You should contact them if you are unsure. I think you may have to contact them to leave the program as well to get your shares back, IDK.

TD - Looks like TD loans your shares out but IDK if you can opt out or if they will automatically recall your shares. It may be the same fund as Schwab, you should contact them to make sure your shares are not loaned out.

EDIT: Vanguard - Securities Lending Program, but I don't know any details about it because they don't appear to be public. You'll have to probably read your agreement...

Having a margin account does not mean that your shares will be loaned out, read your agreements or talk to your broker. After reading the above broker's agreements they loan out securities in these situations, but they may also loan them out if you bought the securities with margin, i.e. borrowed money to buy on leverage. You would need to ask your broker about that, they don't really appear to disclose that or it's probably in some addendum or some shit.

If you are unsure if your shares are loaned out, you should contact your broker."

One lawyer will be instructed to sell one share, worth trillions, and this will set off a chain reaction of events with a series of lawyers spread throughout the globe getting paid from that trillion to each do one simple task, all of them not knowing the identity of the other.

Theres a company headed by a brilliant guy that created a 4 billion company in 3 years, helped by former Amazon and Chewey execs, with a loyal following in the millions, which has the potential to make shares go to 450 each on fundamentals alone in a few years.

Not only is it on sale for 170 currently which makes me want to invest already, but also theres a massive squeeze potential where this could turn me into a millionaire?

AND THEY THINK SHORTING THE PRICE DOWN IS GOING TO SCARE ME AWAY? 😂

One room could be FPS. Another could be LoL. Maybe have another for rocket league. There are so many possibilities. Or if there aren’t any events going on they could just throw up popular streamers (maybe deals with them involved to do so?) either way shit could be HUGE

So I said “well I’m glad you’re fucking retarded. Are you guys lending my gme shares to Kenny?” 

He says “ No sir, your account is yours and yours only!”

So I raided my wife’s “mad money” account for $700. She’s out of town. Hope she doesn’t notice. Ordered up 3 more. A small tasty dip at open and I would have enough to add another.  That would give me 40. 

I’m a boomer who lost a ton of $ when tech melted down. 2001-2002. Then lost a another shit ton of $ in 2008-09 with the housing bubble and recession. Been out of the market ever since. But all you younger apes sucked me back in. I appreciate all of you and the amount of work you all do to generate great DD. Plus giving me lots of amusement with humorous comments. I’ve learned so much in past 3 months. If I’d known then what I know now I never would have lost so much money. But now I’m going to get it all back, and then some. I’m doing this to make some money, but the chance to FO the hedgies is also a big motivation. Revenge is a dish best served cold. 

Whatever I make 10% is going to local charities, that has already been determined. Thanks for welcoming a boomer into the ape community. I am very grateful.

2021-04-09 14:47:51,wallstreetbets,"so max pain (if you like that theory - and I do for most stocks but GME is not most stonks so grain of salt this) says it's still 180 as of 11:45am. [http://maximum-pain.com/options/GME](http://maximum-pain.com/options/GME)

Now, there's a SHITLOAD of puts at 160 so I see it closing above that, or very close to that, as the floor. there's a ton of overlap and volume at 175, so that actually looks like true max pain to me. I would say we close between 160.5 and 179.5. If I had to bet based solely off max pain combined with today's activity, I'd say 169.5 or 174.5"

Email: rule-comments@sec. Gov 

Subject: File No. SR-NSCC-2021-801 

Message: 

I am an individual retail investor and would like to express my 
opinion regarding this new proposed rule SR-NSCC-2021-801. 

believe this rule-if enacted-is a step in the right direction 
towards accountability for those who engage in the short 
selling/stock borrowing program. It is time for an update to 
the current RegSHO closeout requirements and I believe that 
this SLD change in process from Monthly to Daily settlement 
is progress. 

I would like to see this rule passed and implemented 
immediately. 

Lastly on this ruling, I would like to see stronger penalties 
enacted for non compliance and violation of this rule. 

Thank you for your time & consideration in this matter. 

Sincerely,"

The rocket is nearly loaded. My fellow apes and I eagerly await liftoff. Some of the younger apes grow restless and poop-flinging has grown by a factor of 1.4 over the last moon cycle. The Great Ape-Cat assures us that all is well, and has increased his stake to 1 quadrillion shares of moonstonk. Today I made a discovery: not only are crayons delicious and nutritious but they make my ape-dong stand up tall when I put them in my no-no place. Further research is warranted on this matter.

I'm not 100% sure I'm understanding it correctly, but it seems like it finds the price based off the maximum loss possible between calls and puts. If this is true, then shouldn't we stop buying calls and let the 🌈🐻 buy puts so that the max pain theory pushes up the price to cause maximum pain loss for all the puts? Plus just use that money to buy more stock?

Again, i figured im missing something in the theory or just not understanding it all together. Maybe there needs to be calls for it to work or something."

If you have shares that are loaned out, recall them immediately. If you are unsure, contact your broker and make sure your shares are not loaned out. If they are make sure you can get them back and opt out of lending if you can. Otherwise you won't be able to vote at the annual meeting. Here's some information on what I know:

RH or eToro - You're screwed. They lend your share out, you have no control. Maybe they are nice and get it back for you so you can proxy vote but I am betting not... Maybe try to contact them, good luck with that...

Fidelity - Fully Paid Lending, must have $250k in assets, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

ETrade - Fully Paid Lending, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

IB - Stock Yield Enhancement Program, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall your shares.

Webull - Stock Lending Income Plan, must opt in, they pick stocks to short, you must leave the program to get stocks back unless they are returned. You should probably contact them.

Schwab - Securities Lending Program, must apply, shares become part of a fund or something? You should contact them if you are unsure. I think you may have to contact them to leave the program as well to get your shares back, IDK.

TD - Looks like TD loans your shares out but IDK if you can opt out or if they will automatically recall your shares. It may be the same fund as Schwab, you should contact them to make sure your shares are not loaned out.

If you are unsure if your shares are loaned out, you should contact your broker

I hope this helps and if there's any I missed or something is incorrect, please let me know.

EDIT: This the information I was able to determine from agreements and services at each brokerage. You should read your agreement, I think many of you don't know how much you're being fleeced...

EDIT2: I didn't really think about this before but I'm not even sure that eToro allows you to proxy vote, I think they might vote with your shares... Has anyone ever proxy voted on eToro?"

Last night I was playing super smash bros as Donkey Kong. Crushing it. Started playing against another DK. For like 3 hours. Best matches of my smash career. Epic battles everytime. Neither of us could stop playing. Kept saying alright, this is the last one, but just kept going because the incredible Ape on Ape action was more than just smash, we were connecting on a deeper level. Hands weren't cramping up either because I bought an extended ergonomic Switch controller from GameStop. We shot each other friend requests when it was finally time to get some sleep after my wife said you need to stop or else. Should have kept going. 

What does this mean? It's clearly a sign that having this battle of apes is worth it and good things will come out of it. Don't stop, just keep playing. Or something 🚀"

We want to have families, but it’s not the same to support a family as it used to be. We don’t want to live in basements, but it may be the only way for people to establish any version of savings so maybe they can one day do more. At the very least when we’re all working through the retirement we won’t be able to take because past generations fucked us, maybe we can have a dollar to our name so we can take a break now and again.

2021-04-09 16:02:13,wallstreetbets,"Rough day for some of us 🦍 but it was another win today. This price is still too high, in which these ‘professionals’ see no real support for :D.

Lets put some things in perspective here on a real time basis. If you are holding, keep doing what you are doing, the price don’t matter until Moon.

If you are playing this price action like I am.  Keep your eyes on the prize like I am. DFV’s call positions are coming up, he hasn’t failed us yet & I don’t see why he would. 

The total recall starting on 4/15 is what all this cumulation has been all about now after the first mini squeeze. *We are finally going to see how deep this rabbit hole goes for those that are bad short & refuse to cover.* We could all be wrong & that is the end of it... OR you trust the great DD that has come & seen first hand all the bs going on & know what is up. No matter what, keep doing what you are doing if nothing has changed & don’t spend more you aren’t willing to lose.

I have been called a cultist, karma farmer, a charleton, told to sell sell sell. All the bad reporting by the media & even lately, them backtracking. Never in my life have I seen so many people concerned about my money in the market before like this. It isn’t a coincidence. 

Have a great weekend & next week is going to be a week of weeks!

Theres a company headed by a brilliant guy that created a 4 billion company in 3 years, helped by former Amazon and Chewey execs, with a loyal following in the millions, which has the potential to make shares go to 450 each on fundamentals alone in a few years.

Not only is it on sale for <$160 currently which makes me want to invest already, but also theres a massive squeeze potential where this could turn me into a millionaire?

If you have shares that are loaned out, recall them immediately. If you are unsure, contact your broker and make sure your shares are not loaned out. If they are make sure you can get them back and opt out of lending if you can. Otherwise you won't be able to vote at the annual meeting. Here's some information on what I know:

RH or eToro - You're screwed. They lend your share out, you have no control. Maybe they are nice and get it back for you so you can proxy vote but I am betting not... Maybe try to contact them, good luck with that...

Fidelity - Fully Paid Lending, must have $250k in assets, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

ETrade - Fully Paid Lending, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

IB - Stock Yield Enhancement Program, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall your shares.

Webull - Stock Lending Income Plan, must opt in, they pick stocks to short, you must leave the program to get stocks back unless they are returned. You should probably contact them.

Schwab - Securities Lending Program, must apply, shares become part of a fund or something? You should contact them if you are unsure. I think you may have to contact them to leave the program as well to get your shares back, IDK.

TD - Looks like TD loans your shares out but IDK if you can opt out or if they will automatically recall your shares. It may be the same fund as Schwab, you should contact them to make sure your shares are not loaned out.

If you are unsure if your shares are loaned out, you should contact your broker."

It will help make it happen, and it will send the rocket farther faster. That is why dips are so attractive for the thesis. This is a situation where if you have anxiety, the literal antidote is buying. It will NOT increase the price until the rocket lifts, that is also important to understand.

2021-04-09 17:39:50,wallstreetbets,"Simple math will show you how much these fuckers lie: 

(Correct me if I’m wrong) 

Melvin claims 1st quarter losses of 49%. 
January -53%
February +22%
March -7%.

Now if I have $100, and I lose 53%, I have $47. 
If I gain 22% on that, I have ($47 x 1.22) $57.34. If I lose an additional 7% of that I have ($57.34 x 0.93) $53.33. 

What they’re claiming, is they lost 49% in the first quarter. If I lost 49% of my initial $100, I’d have $51.00.

My take is they lost more in March than they cared to admit, or they’re losing more lately. 

TLDR: 1x0.47x1.22x0.93 =/= 1x0.51"

Today I'm going to set a limit buy for a few shares at $160.  And I'll check in occasionally to see if there's any serious movement on the price that I should act on.

I posted these plans in the ""What are your moves tomorrow"" thread yesterday, and instantly received a bunch of derision over even having $GME stock.  What's up with that?  I feel I'm acting prudently.  True, it's a bit of a risk in that the stock may simply go down and otherwise stop moving, but risk is the name of the game, I figure.

2021-04-09 10:58:13,wallstreetbets,"At 100 shares now and holding. The reason why I think the stock is good is because the company can pivot with this leadership and we hold the stock price up by holding our shares. It may take longer as the shorts wait till the heat dies down, but a long as everyone holds, it really doesn't matter what the hedgefunds do. If they stop shorting (for now) it signals to the market that the stock is good. So as long as people buy and hold, the stock goes up. If they really think the stock is bad, they'll short it again. But, if people buy and hold, then they will get squeezed. So the only good play here is to buy and hold. If the shorts don't come back like they were in Jan, GME becomes Chewy and the stock goes up because it's good. If the shorts come back, then we get the MOASS because the stock is good and the shorts are wrong.

As long as people don't paper hand, the price action doesn't really matter. This is a unique play where as long as you hold,  you benefit from either people believing in the company or people betting against the company."

2021-04-09 12:35:53,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t even make sense. It’s all obvious. Ryan Cohen announced as leader of the board. Share recall for 4/20 apparently yet price is tanking. This is their last ditch effort to save their ass before takeoff. If you sell now you deserve to lose money. The next few months this thing will be 3-400 even after the squeeze.

2021-04-09 12:09:03,wallstreetbets,"Whales ought to be swarming today.  5000+ oi at each 200c, 250c, and 300c is creating nice g-squeeze potential and giving MMs good reason to hold the price down until EOD.  Will be interesting to see if some whales try to spark a feeding frenzy this afternoon.

Not trying to set anyone up for disappointment though.  If nothing happens today, I’m fine scooping up some more discounted shares and maybe some weekly calls expiring next Friday.  The strategy of shooting the price down and targeting stop loss orders just resulted in huge buying frenzies and sharp dip recoveries which meant we got more shares and shorties just dug themselves in deeper.  Now they are trying a slow bleed strategy but that causes gamma and delta to decrease and gives a better opportunity to buy call options close to the price (i.e. see end of February).  In other words they have to fight a g-squeeze and MOASS and no matter what as long as we hold on to the bananas, we already won."

Theres a company headed by a brilliant guy that created a 4 billion company in 3 years, helped by former Amazon and Chewey execs, with a loyal following in the millions, which has the potential to make shares go to 450 each on fundamentals alone in a few years.

Not only is it on sale for 170 currently which makes me want to invest already, but also theres a massive squeeze potential where this could turn me into a millionaire?

I am seeing TA talking about head and shoulders patterns. Don't let a price drop scare you into selling for a loss. If our shares are indeed IOU's, the worst thing you can do is sell them.  

It's easy to say that when you're in the green. However, if more red does come, just remember to hold onto Ryan and future prospects because the current price really does not matter if you can wait long enough.

 We examine the market consequences of due diligence (DD) reports on Reddit’s Wallstreetbets (WSB) platform. We find average ‘buy’ recommendations result in two-day announcement returns of 1.1%. Further, the returns drift upwards by 2% over the subsequent month and nearly 5% over the subsequent quarter. Retail trading increases sharply in the intraday window following publication, and retail investors are more likely to be net buyers following reports that earn larger returns. **Thus, in sharp contrast to regulators concerns that WSB investment advice is harming retail traders, our findings suggest that both WSB posters and users are skilled**.

Entire thing is incoherent word salad and the ""facts"" it links to is shit like ""Melvin is still holding 6 million puts in February after the hearing!""  But get this, THEIR supplied link to the 13f shows that it was reported in February but like every fucking 13f out there it's based on calendar quarter data.  So they're saying Melvin lied about being short in February because they still had 6 million puts in *December*.  And no one there even realizes or understands this.

We all know inflation is coming and with it higher rates. How long will market count on the greater fool theory? By the time the fed actually moves stocks will be 50% lower. People actually think they’ll be able to sell the top once the fed starts hiking. Keep dreaming.

2021-04-09 10:49:01,wallstreetbets,"If PLTR ends up red at end of day today it will have sealed its fate as the most resistant stock I have ever traded.

Of course I will buy more since I'm long term, but wow. just wow.

constant contracts across diverse sectors, most government. a company that prioritizes its disruptive product (Get it right before get it done), this is what companies like tesla/amazon/apple were doing back in the day before they exploded. mission centered disruptive companies that identify a specific need that others do not see or do not want to tackle and hone on it like a laser over 10+ years until it's complete.

I work in data analytics at a large health company. if PLTR accomplishes what they want (they are not there yet with their products IMO), it would significantly reduce the burden for our company and allow us access to patient insights at a 10x+ rate than current. its nuts. I deal with mounds of patient data, both identified and de-identified. there is so much fucking value in this aggregate data its mind boggling. data sources are device implant data, tracker data, clinical data, literature data. a massive treasure trove of insights. the data isn't perfect, but its improving and will continue to do so. patient insights that improve patient outcomes are contained in this massive sandbox of data, and we currently do not have the capability to extract it. we need companies like PLTR to help us. this. literally. will. save. lives.

I'm  sitting here looking into the future and see the direct value, its a no brainer. yet, the rest of the world is stuck in the 90s.

the stock movement defies all logic and reason. and the greedy suits and others that don't see this are blindsided by short terms profits. you. are. fucking. morons.

BUY MORE"

Its fills are so shitty that you are almost always guaranteed to lose money even if shit goes for you since you won't be able to sell your contracts at a profit once it goes up in value. I've had so many times when my calls are up 30-40% but can't take a profit because shitty RH won't fill them.

DMX would take a party of boring ass white kids and turn them into a bunch of rowdy animals. This was the shit you blasted when you were smoking a blunt in a parking lot. I had Its Dark and Hell is Hot as one of maybe 4 CDs in my car for most of high school. I could probably rap the whole thing today 20 years later. The energy he brought to shit was unmatched.

There is one item of interest on the economic calendar today: The Producer Price Index, or PPIs, at 0830. Expectations are for a 0.5% increase in the price of goods sold by manufacturers. A number that overshoots will bring the inevitable concerns about inflation. Bonds are being sold off a bit this morning, probably in anticipation of this. Ten-year yields are up to 1.671%.

Other than that it should make for another quiet day on Wall Street. Maybe an opportunity for companies or others to release some unwelcome news, perhaps late the afternoon? Wouldn’t be the first time.

2021-04-09 15:04:33,wallstreetbets,The fact that theta affects stock over weekends and holidays...
2021-04-09 15:36:37,wallstreetbets,"FUCK. AMC. Not just the stock, but the company and its CEOs too. Here’s why:

AMC - and the movie theater industry in general - had been dying a slow death long before covid even hit. It turns out that very few people want to pay $20 for a ticket and $25 for popcorn in order to sit in a cramped, dirty theater and watch yet another braindead sequel/remake/shitty spin-off. AMC was already struggling with decreased profits and millions of dollars in debt when covid hit, forcing them to close their doors. The company, it was assumed, was DOA - another victim of covid.

But then, something happened that could only be described as a miracle. Small retail investors and traders - millions of them - poured what little they could into the stock. They did so because they had faith in the company, and saw a future for it in the post-covid world. The CEO was profusely thankful for this, going so far as to call it a “lifeline” in a public statement.

And then - rather than using this so-called “lifeline” to invest in the company’s future, or use it to help the company transition to a post-covid economy, this DICKHEAD CEO named Adam Aron takes the money and more than DOUBLES his fucking salary, from $9.5 million up to nearly $21 million - giving a giant proverbial middle finger to retail investors everywhere.

This absolute fuckwit, unlike the millions of people who believed in his company, decided that rather than going through the effort of reinventing AMC and breathing new life into the company, he’d rather just pocket enough money to give himself a cushy safety net for when it goes under. Shame!!

This is why I hope AMC crashes and burns until there’s nothing left. I say let it go the way of Sears, or Blockbuster. To continue to buy AMC is to transfer your money upwards to bandits who are looking to rob you as much as possible before they make their getaway. Don’t let them! Sell your AMC now and let those assholes deal with the fallout. Thank me later.

In case it wasn’t clear: FUCK AMC 🖕"

**(On duty) mods in here**, a user I previously conversed with contacted me asking if I could ask someone to get her post approved. She said she couldn't get it approved or message anyone(?). She's kind of new and having difficulties.

I don't if she did something wrong and was flagged, **so leave me out of drama if so**, but she's knowledgeable and doing interesting stuff, like analyzing vol-surfaces and helping dummies take [trades](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m77ifn/no_game_in_c3ai_price_target_42/) with better risk/reward than they usually do.

2021-04-09 12:38:37,wallstreetbets,"I found out today that Chipotle Mexican Grill shares trade at over $1500 each.

Because I don't understand why the price is so high, I can't justify betting for or against it.

But that seems pretty nonsensical.

If 1000+ tutes are in for 95% of the shares, is this even a market anymore? A large downward shift in share price would force the holders to buy it back up since that's probably cheaper than selling at a loss, and a large upward shift would not result in any institutional selling.

I don't know if there's a historical record of institutional ownership changes, but it would be nice to know how long it's been owned like this.

But, like...isn't this all very wrong?"

2021-04-09 08:45:53,wallstreetbets,That kind of water damage has most certainly led to more than just some mildew. There’s a pretty good chance the wood is rotten all the way down the walls - let’s just say I wouldn’t wanna be in that house during an earthquake. You should definitely mot be so casual about it. Any interior leaking for more than a month is a good indicator that much worse problems exist inside the roof and walls. Could even be rotting the foundation or pooling in the basement if there is one.

Admins was like a foster care pet signup - but for admins - and you don’t know who you get but they hang out as a mod. Essentially the boss is coming to check shit out but WSB is asking the boss to come check shit out 🤨

2021-04-09 08:54:06,wallstreetbets,TA may be the most applicable on GME and other emotion traded stocks as it's almost exclusively an emotion/psychology tracker.

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"State of the Market + ULTA Overnight Trading Strategy   

**State of the Market**

Optimism is still high on practically everything in the market now. The main exception is the Japanese Yen, which is good for me, as I live in Japan while spending USD. Nevertheless, I do not think the downtrend in the Yen will last and will thus look for some way to hedge my dollar-to-yen (either by investing in FXY or leaving Japan).

Breadth is recovering, which is dampening our short-term pullback theory. However, a lot of the breadth recovery is in more defensive sectors, such as consumer staples. This could mean that investors are seeing growth stocks as overvalued and thus hedging against underperformance.

I’m still short-term bearish, expecting the gap in the SPY to fill.

**Today’s Trade**

I see a lot of insider selling in ULTA. We have director Charles Heilbronn selling half a million shares for nearly $2M and an overall total sell:buy ratio of 2.4, which is 50% higher than usual. When we see large amounts of insider selling, we are usually close to a top.

Unlike most stocks in the market today, ULTA shows an overnight dip pattern. Whereas most stocks are bid up overnight, ULTA sells off. This makes going short ULTA overnight every night a decent short trade strategy – and it doesn’t label you a pattern day trader.

With the current run-up in ULTA, it is slightly overbought. The Fibs also show that ULTA tends to pull back after such movements. With a resistance level at around $325, the current price is a good short entry point.

ULTA’s max pain for the end of the month is $305, so this is a good price target. That gives us about $15 profit downward. I’m going to be holding ULTA short overnight until the end of the month.

Three potential strategies should work here:

l Hold ULTA short

l But also sell ATM puts during the day

l Buy the puts back at the end of the day

l Repeat daily

OR

l Sell ULTA ATM calls at the end of the day

l Buy back at the open the next day

l Repeat daily

OR

l Buy ULTA puts at the end of the day

l Sell them at the open the next day

l Repeat daily

I’m going to run this until the end of the month. If you want a long put suggestion, I’d say go with the Apr16 $330 puts today and then switch to equally ITM puts a week out starting next week (i.e., the Apr23 puts).

Happy trading."

And GME keeps dipping to some stupid price I'm comfy with and I just buy more. Been trading several years, but only started diving into options in the last year or so.  At first I just played around with low cost stuff to get the hang of how it worked.  Then Jan rolled around and I stopped messing with it and bought GME.   Now I'm at a point I feel comfy running the wheel and have a solid idea of what I'd be doing, but every time I have a decent enough amount of cash in my account, hedgies (or whoever) do their thing and all I can see is discount tendies.

2021-04-09 17:19:06,wallstreetbets,"The tldr version is if your cost basis is low (lets just say sub 120) then this is a great strat. If your cost basis isnt low, then this dosnt make sense because you bought these shares hoping for it to moon. If it moons while your shares are covered, then all you can do is watch on the sidelines or buy your calls back at a loss. I say that because if it shoots past 500 then it probably wont stay there too long so your shares probably wouldnt get called away and you get to watch it drop back down. Premium kept, but moon missed. You are essentially trying to time the moon."

2021-04-09 19:34:28,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense; hadn’t thought about how the options price to buy back would change as it goes further and further up.  I was avg’d at $88/share, now I’m closer to $140.

I also have a shares I’m not selling calls on, but hadn’t considered the calls not getting exercised when they went ITM.  I guess I don’t have a clear idea of how long it might stay there and assumed they’d get exercised almost immediately.

I’m not really expecting a moon shot at this point, but I’m comfy holding what I have at recent price points.  Hell, the other day O was hoping this would drag out another 7-8 months for tax purposes!

Thanks for the information!"

Look at the holding of the funds, decide if you'd rather have individual shares or the basket (for ARKG, basket probably better but ARKK and QQQ probably individual stocks as most of those returns are your stock holdings). Realize that this is a dip (or the top of tech) and it could stay flat for a while. Sell deep OTM calls, recoup some costs or generate income, and just check on it every couple weeks (I'd buy 2 more GME and sell calls there as well, the premiums are nuts)."

If we can get real subscriber growth and continued explosive revenue momentum (not just from ad revenue but from customers), then we will be good. We need FUBO to be successful in the marketplace.

If we do not substantially increase subscribers, and Dave’s half-interested crew keeps up the shenanigans they have been up to all year — they do not seem focused in 2021 — then longs including myself might end in big trouble. We’ll see. 🤞💎"

But TBH I’ve lost hope on that... too far fetched and Gandler badly did any legwork on setting up the sports betting infrastructure & tech. He used the rumor and Photoshop renderings as a catalyst to move the stock, but we all know that sports betting within FUBO is a pipe dream. Let’s just pray that more cord cutting subscribers hear about FuboTV, are willing to spend the high price it costs, and are impressed by the quality of the service they pay for. 

Sports betting is a pipe dream on Fubo because Gandler hasn’t put in the work."

2021-04-09 10:57:41,wallstreetbets,"🤔

Ok so i have three questions.

1. Isn’t that a good thing for us? I mean if things go haywire, hypothetically speaking, is a great chance to invest! Buying the dip to get a higher return. No?

2. Isn’t people tired of talking for crushes like every 5 minutes?
As investors we invest on both good and bad time right? So whats the difference?

3. Talking about crashes all the time, even when a crash is not in the horizon lets say, actually causes the crush eventually? 

Even if it doesn’t cause it in the next few months or years. It still slows the markets progress. IMHO

So why not keep being invested and leave the market do its thing???
Lastly, i hope those 40mil burn to the ground and someone in here posts that loss porn. 🤣"

2021-04-09 10:47:57,wallstreetbets,Sounds to me like they’re long volatility which doesn’t necessarily mean a market crash
2021-04-09 03:25:25,wallstreetbets,"Lol yeah this is part of a larger strategy for sure. Almost certainly some kind of hedge.

Edit: this is even a hedge against a market correction. Vix at 25 isn't even that high, it was around that during the tech correction recently. I believe (without checking) it was in the low 30s during election.

I'm lead to believe the person writing this article had no idea of what they were talking about, or did but had no content so wrote this 'scare mom' article anyway. 

This seems like a really obvious move given that the vix is nearly down to it's historic average at the moment and we are still in these weird ass political/covid times. The reason they might be doing this, over protective long puts on the stock they own, is because you could maybe see vix spike to profitable levels with even a minor correction or some political event that doesn't even hurt the market that much, and profit off both ends of this trade. On top of that if there's a total market crash then these will pay $$$$$. I mean, my account isn't big enough to bother with it but I get it."

2021-04-09 09:10:54,wallstreetbets,I completely agree with this. VIX has been relatively low lately it’s a great time to buy calls as a hedge on it.

2021-04-09 02:10:37,wallstreetbets,"Right, peoplez are so fukin stupid"

Thus no buyers of a unicorn inflated stock. You now hold a stock for much longer bc more people/funds are broke and you are just left alone... oh and the company is in a worse position again 

Thus decreasing the price and increasing the bid/ask width which is cancer"

2021-04-09 09:14:33,wallstreetbets,Probably by some kind of entity that hedges and has large amoubts of funds. Lets call it a hedge fund
2021-04-09 15:20:47,wallstreetbets,Probably a scare piece. Always do the opposite of what these articles say.

2021-04-09 06:10:09,wallstreetbets,Then you probably wanted to sell the 20 and buy the 26 and 30 then when you setup the hedge initially to make a laddered entry where if the crash never comes you get most of your investments back and if it goes to 40 you get paid well.
2021-04-09 05:43:02,wallstreetbets,🌕
2021-04-09 09:04:33,wallstreetbets,Hit 80s during covid and in 2008 so yeah it was would be a crash lol

2021-04-09 12:11:44,wallstreetbets,80s actually
2021-04-09 15:26:03,wallstreetbets,"Looking at the history of vix, it seems like theres a history of vix going from historical highs back down to low 20s/high 10s, and gapping back up. Sort of suggests the market has a history of being overly optimistic with recoveries and reality setting in one last time before it truly bakes in how things are. 

Almost feels like the market got ahead of itself with mass QE/inflation, and half the world still locked down with a vix at 16."
2021-04-09 03:17:23,wallstreetbets,like a fund hedge?
2021-04-09 12:56:00,wallstreetbets,....or it's a hedge for all of their long positions. Just like it's common to do. Nothing to do with a squeeze.

2021-04-09 06:05:15,wallstreetbets,"Okay didn’t expect this haha. I mean, from the best of my understanding in all the DD the past few months points to a market collapse. Ca someone educate me as to why I have been downvoted (I don’t care, down vote me more if you want). but telling me that’s what hedgefunds do doesn’t really makes sense if you’re short for less than you are long (40M < 1B right?) Give me some wrinkles 😅"
2021-04-09 08:38:26,wallstreetbets,"Yes, we have options on how to use it."
2021-04-09 07:10:06,wallstreetbets,But wouldn't your profits be very limited as the 20 increases rapidly  in value as VIX approaches 40?
2021-04-09 13:16:16,wallstreetbets,Good point. Makes sense

The rest of the market gonna lag out for a sec as GME moons and it’s cuz the hedgies will have to reallocate. This is exactly what happened on Jan 27 and why the Vix went almost to 40. The even created redness in the market that day, however a Vix “spike” different from a gradual surge, so the redness in the market was fleeting. The worst of it lasted a day where a lot of big companies like FB and stuff were down a percent or a couple"

And it’s easy to get lucky once. Say you have a hundred people flip a coin. If they get heads they advance to the next round; tails they’re out. Statistically eventually you’d be left with one guy who consistently flipped heads 6 or 7 times in a row. He’s not skillful; he’s just lucky. Right place at the right time.

All these star hedge fund guys are those people. For every one of them there’s thousands who didn’t make it. Burry is top dog now because he got lucky in 2008. Whether he’s skilled or lucky, only time will tell."

The DOW became popular during the economic panics and depressions of the early 20th century, when people were desperate for any sign of how the economy was doing. People were no longer investing so they created it so that it would just show the best companies and people would say oh wow! The Dow is up!!! Even though they had to wait in line to get a loaf of bread. Back when our economy was simpler the performance of thirty big companies was actually pretty useful information, but as our economy grew and became more complex, the DOW started to tell us less and less. And, today, financial insiders don't even pay attention to it. Now we’ve just added S&P 500, NASDAQ and NASDAQ 100 RUSSELL etc etc etc. All are all the exact same goal in mind."

You really really need to watch Burrys Analysis on the 2008 Market. He made in depth prognostications, alarmed other Analysts who confirmed with primary source research and ultimately was right. Also, he isn't throwing his speculations around, he's done it twice now. One for 2008 and one for this year. 

As someone that knows specific people from the European Banks, I can assure you that Europe's Banks are preparing for a heavy crash coming this year."

Even he didn’t know the “when”, and the only reason why he’s famous now is because a dozen things all went his way exactly, things he had no control over. That’s why his big short was a bet.

And that's 5 years of dead money. Not how investing works. I might very easily go to $20 and hover there for a decade. 

Since you seem new to this. Open the chart of INTC, you will see that investors from early 2000 are still underwater. And that is with a highly successful tech company. If you invested in GE back then, you'd be down 80%.

2021-04-09 01:49:06,wallstreetbets,"Stephen is one of retard kings. He always makes fucking heroic come back in his movies. I cried especially at the beginning & end scene of mute girl (beautiful ape girlie) in Kung Fu Hustle. You need to watch the entire movie at least 3x. I wish AMC play all Stephen’s movies. I will pay to watch it there with tendies, pizza, large bucket of buttery popcorns & couple cold 805 drafts."

2021-04-09 07:28:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry, I have to disagree.  I was living in Japan in the year leading up to the world cup.  They played the preview for Shaolin Soccer at every movie I went to that year. 

Kung Fu Hustle is good, but Shaolin Soccer is a sports manga come to life, and will always be my favorite."
2021-04-09 00:19:17,wallstreetbets,"Shaolin Soccer is great if you can speak Cantonese and understand Hong Konger jokes, like the rest of Stephen Chow's movies... 

My favourite is The God of Cookery (1996)."
2021-04-09 07:51:29,wallstreetbets,"I dunno man - I think they're both amazing in their own right. Kungfu hustle is definitively the better story with more of an epic tale, but I actually think Shaolin soccer was hands down funnier and a way bigger homage to DBZ and over the top anime fans."
2021-04-09 03:55:44,wallstreetbets,"Check out Journey to the West, very similar but different. Lotta humor and mysticism."

2021-04-09 08:49:17,wallstreetbets,I absolutely hated all his movies from shaolin soccer and after. His old works were so much better. My favorite were A Chinese Odyssey.
2021-04-09 06:13:31,wallstreetbets,He's a pretty good singer too does anyone else genuinely like his singing ?
2021-04-09 08:34:53,wallstreetbets,Mermaid is no good. It lost a lot of Stephen Chow's Hong Kong-er style to cater to Mainland China audience. And also because he didn't act in it.
2021-04-09 11:57:41,wallstreetbets,I love his stuff.. I just didn’t recognize this particular movie.

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Hydrofarm ($HYFM) —> Cannabis & Controlled Environment Agriculture In November 2020, California-based cannabis supply distributor Hydrofarm Holdings Group [filed for $100 Million NASDAQ IPO](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/cannabis-supply-distributor-hydrofarm-files-for-100-million-nasdaq-ipo/) 

On December 14, 2020, the Company successfully completed its IPO of common stock at $20.00 per share. Closed today at [$57.55](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/hyfm). The Company issued 9,966,667 shares of common stock, including the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,300,000 additional shares of common stock. The Company received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $182.3 million after underwriter discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay debt, increase cash holdings and reposition the Company’s capital structure for future growth

Hydrofarm operates across Canada and the U.S., serving over 2000 wholesale customers with 2 Canadian and 6 American distribution centers. It sells a range of products that include lighting, cultivation equipment, grow media, nutrients and supplies. The vast majority of its customers are specialty hydroponic retailers.

In the first three quarters of 2020, the company increased its revenue 40% to $254.8 million compared to the first three quarters of 2019, with about 83% of revenue generated in the U.S. Gross margin during the first three quarters was 18.7%, and the company reported an operating profit of $10.7 million

More recently, their [Q4 Revenue Increased 63% to $87.4 Million](https://investors.hydrofarm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hydrofarm-holdings-group-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year/)

Looking ahead into 2021, CEO Bill Toler, expects robust Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) industry demand will result in organic net sales growth well above the long-term company expectations outlined during their IPO roadshow.

**Controlled Envrionment Agriculture**

>Bill Toler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hydrofarm, said, “Fiscal 2020 was an excellent year for Hydrofarm in many ways. First, our organic sales growth across the year was outstanding, increasing in each sequential quarter and culminating in over 60% year-over-year growth in each of our last two quarters as our entire company **worked feverishly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to meet the growing demand in the CEA industry.**

*Controlled environment agriculture is a technology-based approach toward food production. The aim of CEA is to provide protection and maintain optimal growing conditions throughout the development of the crop. Production takes place within an enclosed growing structure such as a greenhouse or building.*

In other words, an advanced and intensive form of hydroponically-based agriculture where plants grow within a controlled environment to optimize horticultural practices.

The dual impacts of the coronavirus and climate change have had far reaching implications to our food system - from consumers, to retailers, across the supply chain and back to farmers and producers.

The urgency to innovate has never been more apparent. And with the right technologies, incentives and partnerships, our future food system can provide healthy food for all people and mitigate the effects of climate change.  

Controlled Environment Agriculture, including greenhouse and indoor production, is a small, but high-potential part of this future food system.

>The value propositions of CEA have been recognized by food and ag stakeholders, with local and urban controlled production receiving private investment to the tune of $2.0B across North America and Europe, emphasis in the [2018 Farm Bill](https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/2018-farm-bill), and interest from corporations across the supply chain.  

**CEA & Cannabis**

Cannabis growers grow some of the most expensive crops. Flower growers, at scale rely heavily on timing of the crop. Suppose if a flower grower misses on-time blooming for Mother’s Day or Valentine’s Day, that’s a huge loss!

Cannabis and most ornamental flowers are grown as annuals. The whole crop is harvested at once – e.g. cannabis flowers, poinsettias and petunias. Some other flower crops such as roses or gerberas may be harvested multiple times during the crop cycle. Another common aspect of cannabis and ornamental flowers is that they are typically grown as a single layer in greenhouses, hoop-houses and indoor farms. Indoor cannabis growers grow cannabis typically in two layers as well depending on how they maintain the crop habit. Flower growers also use hanging baskets (about a couple of feet below the truss) in greenhouses in addition to crops grown on the floor or tables, a type of a two-layer growing system. Cannabis and ornamental flowers are commonly grown on substrates. For irrigation and fertigation, cannabis growers typically use drip or hand watering; flower growers use automated fertigation using booms or hand watering.

Cannabis cultivation at scale is highly involved as it’s still a relatively understudied crop when it comes to growing more than a few plants. Growers use various techniques to grow different “strains” most of which are not fully genetically characterized. These are typically highly expensive operations. There is a common misconception that the plants will grow and yield linearly when added more and more light.

Every plant has their maximum photosynthetic capacity and could typically be damaged by high light even when other environmental conditions and rootzone factors are at optimum. During the initial stages of photosynthesis, plants harvest the energy of instantaneous light (imagine light as packets of energy) and store them in special molecules that later pass that energy to drive sugar synthesis (we call that carbon fixation). However, just like any biological system, the photosynthetic set up of plants could only take light up to a given threshold, and beyond that, light would be damaging to the system.

>Cannabis is typically grown as single plants on substrates with a lot of plant handling; that means there is a greater chance for plant to plant variation in growth, yield and biochemical consistency if they are not grown under **uniform environmental conditions.**

Cannabis agriculture is a multi-billion dollar industry in the United States that is changing rapidly with policy liberalization. At this time, more than 60% of the US population have access to cannabis as states continue to legalize.

The most significant growth in the cannabis business has been the emergence of CEA and its associated energy implications. CEA is a production approach that operates “sealed” (controlled) rooms to control temperature, humidity, CO2, and other conditions to maximize crop production, especially for high value crops.  While CEA is not a new production approach in the Ag sector as it has been used for other high-value crops it is **increasingly being adopted by cannabis growers as it can generate 3-4 cannabis crops (turns) per year, supports more strains and optimizes quality control far superior to outdoor systems.** The typical CEA operation for cannabis production can support one plant per 4 square feet with the potential output of one-half pound per plant. The CEA production model allows the grower to vary energy and water inputs by production phase, especially the variable lighting to address growth stages.

Properly applied, Controlled Environment Agriculture, from Hydrofarm will provide protection and maintain optimal growing conditions throughout the development and distribution of a cannabis or other specialty crop within the sector. CEA optimizes use of resources such as water, energy, space, capital, and labor, reducing expense and enhancing crop yields while minimizing environmental impacts. 

**Competition**

SCOTTS MIRACLE-GRO & HAWTHORNE GARDENING ($SMG)

Scotts Miracle-Gro CEO, Jim Hagedorn, calls the “pot business”, in which he intends to invest “like, half a billion” the “biggest thing I’ve ever seen in lawn and garden.” 

Formed in October 2014, Hawthorne Gardening is The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company's subsidiary for **cannabis growers** and one of the first major investments by a major United States corporation in the cannabis industry.

Did you know...

Scotts Miracle-Gro was the main financial supporter of push to legalize weed in New Jersey:

https://mjbizdaily.com/scotts-miracle-gro-leads-funding-to-legalize-adult-use-cannabis-in-new-jersey/

>The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company has emerged as the primary financial backer of New Jersey’s cannabis legalization effort, donating **$800,000** to two campaign committees formed to back the Nov. 3 ballot question that would amend the state constitution to allow cannabis to be bought and sold for recreational use.

GROWGENERATION ($GRWG)

The company owns and operates retail hydroponics and organic specialty gardening retail outlets. It is engaged in selling of products, such as organic nutrients and soils, advanced lighting technology, hydroponic, and aquaponic equipment, and other products needed to grow indoors and outdoors. The products include harvesting, soils and mediums, containers and trays, pest and disease control, nutrients and additives, hydroponics, grow lights, fans and ventilation, and cloning/propagation. 

**Technicals/Conclusion**

In my opinion, with [cannabis legalization](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/7088824002) on the horizon and many Americans still in quarantine, people will turn to homegrowing & DIY hydroponic projects. This is why Hydrofarm presents a **unique opportunity** in regards to US legalization of cannabis.

Hydrofarm brings productive commercial technology to **home Hydroponics**..

Commercial growers have been using efficient hydroponic methods for years. There's no worry about soil-born diseases or pests, and there's no weeding. For professional growers, quicker harvests and higher yields are good reasons to use hydroponics.

>At Hydrofarm we’ve adapted these proven techniques to convenient home gardening systems. We have incorporated high performance technology with quality professional-grade materials, and designed a full range of systems for your personal use.

In fact, 2 weeks ago, Hydrofarm [Highlighted New Products for Sustainable Indoor Farming](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210325005955/en/Hydrofarm-Highlights-New-Products-for-Sustainable-Indoor-Farming) & CEO Bill Toler spoke about how indoor farming will impact the agriculture industry in a [recent interview with Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/indoor-farming-impact-agriculture-industry-150514534.html).

- *“Today we're certainly linked to the cannabis business. But really it's about a controlled environment agricultural sector. It's all indoor growing. And so we think of it as, we have momentum going in our core business, which is our everyday established states all around the country, and we have a legislative agenda that's accelerating the business.”*

- *”So we have good fundamental organic growth going on underneath. And then we have new states coming online, four states passed adult use back in November. As you mentioned, a couple more have added since then. And we feel like that sort of wave is going to continue as we go forward as really Americans say they want it legalized, governments need the tax revenue. It's all pointing towards continued growth in the sector and in the category.”*

- *”So we believe that controlled environment agriculture not only affects obviously cannabis today, but is going to affect you know vegetables and perhaps fruits and other things as we go forward. And we think that there are lots of money and innovation and technology going into that space right now, as you mentioned.”*

The charts present a few bullish indicators..

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Kraft foods DD $khc Let me preface this with my personal reason for picking up Jan 2022 47.50 and 50 calls. Drunken ape me decided mac and cheese was worth it's weight in gold while drunk one night and bought in. Up 250% in a month or 2. 

____________________________
So I'm sure everyone has seen the news on national ketchup shortage. In the past when news like this broke like the toilet paper situation. The toilet paper stocks rocketed. Sanitizer shortages, same thing. 

KHC was green today, but really not that great and low on volume. Any ideas on why the small price action? Just sensory overload, and it was overlooked? 

This stock is top 5 in Buffet's and Burry's portfolio. The company has made all the right moves in terms of paying down debt and making the momentum go the right direction as of late.

I'm thinking that being that we are sitting at a 52 week high there is a mental resistance line to cross. However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off.

Some interesting catalyst I noticed there has been over $65 million in block purchases made. I'm not an expert on these but I couldn't see any other block purchases anywhere near this size on khc in recent past. (If I'm wrong on this, please show me where to find it.)

Assuming that Burry has exercised his call options or will rather than selling, Buffets giant position, the block purchases today, the consistent upwards momentum, the increase in demand and profitability on the ketchup packets. Things look really really good on this company. 

When first researching this stock I really didn't fully understand all of the fundamentals that have been falling in place over the last year to get us to this point. I looked at this stock as a great hedge if and when the market crashes as consumers rotate back into home cooked meals and groceries with less eating out to save money.

I see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me. If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up. If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up. Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up. 

Extremely Bullish on this company.

I am certainly no expert but I love this brand right now.
If anyone wants to add to my thoughts or even poke holes in my statements I encourage it. Id like to know what everyone else thinks about this company. 

Edit update: Open options interest for this week are trending 100% bullish sentiment

Today they announced a new marshmallow snack for grab and go has station type purchases. Marshmallow is one of the highest profit margins of any food products.

2021-04-09 02:18:30,wallstreetbets,That’s probably because packets of ketchup require uranium to make it last forever.  Of course birds are also migrating this time of year so their could be a worm shortage.  Imagine if they found a way into tricking birds into thinking factory workers were their beybeh’s
2021-04-09 02:20:37,wallstreetbets,🤣 nah article says cause COVID restaurants aren't able to use bottles so the packets are depleted and then apparently the packs are made ... you guessed it overseas and got stuck in the suez and are now one of 400 ships sitting off coast of US waiting to be unloaded

2021-04-09 04:54:06,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget they forgot about leap years in 2016, leading to an outage, and then never bothered to fix it - leading to another outage in 2020 for the same exact reason as before.

Also, owning spreads and/or dealing with exercising options can lead to all sorts of glitches, which can show an account balance in the negative hundreds of thousands of dollars. Happened to me plenty of times, with a personal best of over -$400,000 for two days before it got fixed - on a position worth no more than $10k.

If you have an issue like this, good luck ever contacting support. They don't even have a phone number to call, and emails can go days to weeks without getting a response - even if it's a time sensitive issue where you could be losing thousands of dollars a day.

If only they could sell their interface to a real broker, it was so damn pretty and easy to use."

While the hate for it is certainly a small microcosm (sorry, true) and I don't think amounts to a catastrophic loss, there is still enough negative sentiment to make investors wary. That and I think their business model has more risk growth than revenue growth right now. They are experiencing a lot of ""new kid on the block"" growing pains and I don't see a massive opportunity in the market that they are trying to collect on in the near future. I'm betting on a bit of a slump from IPO, but ultimately think they will grow in the future once they get their collective shit together and people's attention spans move past their recent issues and back to the garbage user interface pretty much every other broker has."

*Net deposits are the total amount of all initiated deposits from March 15-March 28, 2021, less any withdrawals or canceled deposits from March 15-April 4, 2021.""*

So yeah, decent 1.66% return in exchange for letting them fondle my money for a merely a couple of days.

But I was kind of worried of an exit scam, or a lot of coincidental ""oopsie poopsie uwu 500 error, unable to withdraw, pwease contact support"", or their reward detection mechanism being as buggy as infinite margin...

The brokerage app not functioning for whatever reason whether it’s a market stop or robinhood fuckery, doesn’t magically change the legal ownership of stock you purchased through their brokerage.

Your whole premise is broken and looking for confirmation.
‘I was unable to sell at the peak therefore I must not actually own my shares’.

This would be criminal fraud by millions of counts, and would have a lot more evidence behind it then just a market freeze."

2021-04-09 09:09:34,wallstreetbets,If you learn from gme shorty’s mistakes and set stop losses instead of rolling up / doubling down your short position- its fine to short a stock.  A more conservative approach would be buying puts.  Neither are going to be available right away on an IPO anyway.

You call your advisor to deal with it but he doesn’t answer so you proceed to off yourself because you got all Fs rather than all As. Instead of sorting out the mess by contacting another office or legal help you go too far with your choice. The next day the university realizes the mistake and changes it. Is this really the schools fault you offed yourself? No.

2021-04-09 09:29:15,wallstreetbets,"Its cheaper to sell short than buy puts (if you’re right about the bearish bet).  Selling calls makes more sense for individual investors than shorting, as these are small positions so there’s little incentive to borrow and sell short just to veil the position.  Selling calls comes with the same unlimited risk that shorting does if you dont own the shares, and you get paid up front for writing the contract.  I wouldn’t recommend it generally, and espectially not for someone new to this type of investing / gambling.  Writing covered contracts on the other hand is a fine strategy and is a great way to maximize profit / hedge against loss on owned stock.  

Selling short is more suited for funds who don’t want the world to know about their bearish bet due to the lack of transparency, as well as the benefit shorting has on pushing the price downward by flooding supply."
2021-04-09 09:21:39,wallstreetbets,We’ll see. When you corner a rat like Citadel they will try everything in their power up to and including questioning ownership.

2021-04-09 09:27:12,wallstreetbets,I understand and I don’t blame the concern but the idea of them violating their own service agreements and the law puts them at an extraordinarily high burden of proof when it comes to seizing ownership in court support. Which would be the only way they could even attempt such.

Vlad won't only fk over Retail, he'll fk over anyone for that. White collar crime has puny sentences. We're talking back room deals here. This isn't normal stuff and anyone who thinks it will end in the MSM is dreaming."
2021-04-09 09:37:53,wallstreetbets,"DUDE, these aren’t physical items someone can just whisk away from you. There is digital record of your purchase of the stock after transferring your money to a broker. None of this has anything to do with MSM. Are they on take from hedgies sure, does that have anything to do with you legally owning a stock... NO.

You are taking unfounded conspiracy rather than considering what’s right in front of you.

I GET that robinhood has a host of large scale issues that will likely cause MUCH larger scrutiny soon.  But discussing Ownership of the stock is a cult of personality dog whistle.

The disdain for RH can be wide spread and founded, but giving in to cultish acceptance of make believe because it confirms the OTHER things you want to believe about the situation isn’t healthy and is reminiscient IMO of Q anon."
2021-04-09 18:51:57,wallstreetbets,Vlad moved to the US at age 5 and his parents both worked at the World Bank. He attended a charter school and then Stanford. You think he was poor?
2021-04-09 09:39:21,wallstreetbets,What I mentioned above is not conspiracy. I cannot say any more about it. Let's agree to disagree and leave it at that. Good discussion.
2021-04-09 19:11:35,wallstreetbets,I have no way of knowing if he was poor or not. Anyone who immigrated at his age around that time was poor. But how is that relevant? His parents working in a bank has nothing to do with the premise that shady side deals happen all the time. It's a reach to assume he will willingly go broke and not cut a deal at the last minute.
2021-04-09 09:44:48,wallstreetbets,You cannot say anymore about it because it’s unfounded made up bullshit and you know that.

Can you please elaborate on this? I’m very new to all this but how do you hedge yourself out of shorts you have to cover? This shit is honestly so fascinating because from what I understand, gme’s recent behavior is uncharted territory so nobody actually knows what’s going to happen.

Will they stall having to cover for a long enough time for the hype to die down and then they purposely push the price down then cover their short positions at a much lower price?"

2021-04-09 10:09:33,wallstreetbets,"Let's say you short a stock at $100. If it goes down you make money, easy enough. 

However, if you think there is a big push to squeeze the stock, you may want to hedge against a massive short term increase. So you buy a call option at $150 for next month for a small amount of money, let's say $1. 

So now you have a few scenarios:

* it drops below 99 and you lose out on your option but make money on the short
* it's between 99 and 150 at the end of the option. You lose on the option and are down on the short, but you aren't squeezed
* It's above 150 and you are making as much (or more) on the call as you are losing on the short

This is very simplified and you can get crazy with options spreads, but the basic idea is to couple a short position with a high risk long position"
2021-04-09 06:33:00,wallstreetbets,"There are different ways to hedge a short but only IF you didn’t short like over 100% of the shares available haha. You could hedge by buying a ITM Call Option or hold some long position which would move exactly the opposite direction. Both only work if you got shares to buy. It’s impossible to hedge against that brutal pile of shit they created. Many institutions nowadays earn through the Spread and HFT in combination with PFOF and don’t Trade in a typical way like we do. 

All in all, we were fucking desperate and many people felt scared and thought there is no mOASS. But is our fellow ape Ryan Cohan just twittered the same meme one guy at WSB  created and all intel and data we got is pointing to the right direction, it looks fucking fantastic atm."

2021-04-09 10:42:09,wallstreetbets,You’re not the boss of me now
2021-04-09 13:57:39,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-09 14:34:51,wallstreetbets,"However, as honeybees are dying the overall population of bees has gone up.
""This is something that a lot of people don’t necessarily understand,"" said Emma Mullen, an associate in the Department of Entymology at Cornell University, ""because if you do track the number of colonies that are in New York or the U.S., they do tend to increase. So what they’ll do is they’ll split their colonies and in that way they can continue to replace the colonies that were lost and grow their operation.""
In the springtime, beekeepers can take a hive that is thriving and split them, creating two from one. Kutik predicted he would create 6,000 new hives in the spring.

This is from the article you posted.  Which to me says bee population is increasing not decreasing so what are you saving the bees from exactly?"
2021-04-09 17:48:35,wallstreetbets,Now your thinking like a real Bulgarian lawyer!
2021-04-09 17:46:15,wallstreetbets,"I think you will find that historically the term ""truth"" while swearing with your hand on a religious text has very different  connotations. 

Most religions have historically viewed their ""belief"" in their religion as an immutable fact and to be the ""truth"".   

Now, I really can't say for sure if the Catholics have it right, or if the Protestants have it right, or maybe its Islam, Buddhism or any of the other 10,000 odd distinct religions in the world have it right..... but they each BELIEVE that their religion is ""the truth"". 

So it could be argued that in fact it has always been a matter of perspective when its all boiled down as 1 persons ""truth"" was very possibly very different to the next person's ""truth"" and swearing on a religious text had nothing to do with binding someone to an oath to relate facts but rather to relate ""your"" truth..."
2021-04-09 15:07:16,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the creativity for trying to justify almond production so I’m stealing this comment from a previous user:

“Our love of almonds has allowed many to replace dairy (almond milk), gluten (almond flour) and peanut allergy (almonds). It has been a decade of boon for Almonds.

The dark side? Almond trees are cruel providers of nectar. There isn’t much nectar so bees can go hungry and what nectar there is makes for bitter honey unfit for anything other than baking (most beekeepers let the bees keep this honey). Bee colonies are weakened from the ordeal and are susceptible to diseases and pesticides that a healthy colony could shake off. Worse is that all the hive shipping to and from California allows for large disease spread (like when they get shipped to Washington’s Apple season).”

In addition to the above, yes other bee population can now thrive but that isn’t necessarily a good thing. Those honeybees are still vital and necessary.

2021-04-09 19:54:46,wallstreetbets,"If that's the case, and all you're doing is giving the truth as you believe it, then why are they so terrified of just stating the obvious?

2021-04-09 15:28:49,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the response. I'm not a big almond consumer or anything I just was missing the rub as to where the downside was for the bees. Didn't know that the pollen from almond trees was subpar for their health as well...the more you know!

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why SPY will go under $400 soon, and possibly as low as $390 We just closed 10 green days in a row. The hasn't happened since August 2020.

Based on the price of the S&P futures right now, the 1d RSI SPY just passes 70. It hasn't done that since late August before Spy fell $34 in 3 days.

The day before that crash the 9 day MA was $9 below and the 50d MA was $30 below. Right now, based on current futures, the 9 day MA is $8 below and the 50d MA is $21 below. The biggest separation since the Sept crash.

Our 30 day volume is 55 million, which is 4 million more than august before volume spiked to 149M before Spy dropped $14 in a single day. The comparison between later August and this month's volume and price action is nearly identical.

The reason why I'm comparing this specifically to the early Sept crash is because no news triggered that crash, indicators were just severally alarming and we had been in HEAVILY overbought territory for 7 days. Then a couple firms liquidated their heavily profited tech positions and caused the algos to trigger a crash. Tomorrow marks the first day of our heavily overbought territory. Since Tech caused the crash last time, let's look at QQQ

The MA before the Sept crash? 60 points off. Right now? 52 points off. RSI last time? 75. RSI now? 67. The Stochastic just flipped today, as it did last time 4 days before the crash. And while we're at it, small caps last time fell 1 month before the Sept crash and didn't recover, similarly to how they are still lagging considerably behind Spy and QQQ right now. Spy needs to hit it's support line (392) to keep the algos happy. And eventually, the algos always get what they want.

I know TA is just crayons on graph, and news and market sentiment is more important. But for short term option gambling, there's a lot of red flags indicating we are due for a pull back. I'm opening 25% of my portfolio in Spy puts tomorrow mid day (3 weeks out). And will do that every day as long as RSI stays above 70 and we don't increase volume."

Until I see that shit trading closer to cash on hand this market is not ready to crash yet. That being said...

I follow a vol trader on twitter that has been saying for months that a window of weakness is gonna appear next week. From what I understand there's always a window of weakness in the week after opex, since Vanna (vol bleed per day from puts) is weakest then. Look at March 2020 timing of the crash, it happened immediately after one opex and stopped at the next opex. Also something about a 5 week opex and 4 week vixperation cycle, also taxes coming due in May and people can finally get cap gains tax on whatever dips they bought right after March 2020.

All the Archegos shit got me looking at tickers differently. I was looking at SEAS and saw that it had a crazy ""reopening"" bump but it's way higher than pre-covid and I always thought that shit was gonna die due to debt anyways.

Also GME looks fucking ready to fly and true to form the lasty 10 green days have mostly sucked for GME. 

I'm not sure it's quite time for me to reach for puts but I may on Monday, I think that's when the window of weakness open."

2021-04-09 09:59:28,wallstreetbets,"Option flow of SPX creates hedging momentum of the market makers (option sellers) as you approach monthly expiration.  This leads to tons of algo trading.  SPX put open interest outnumbers call open interest by about 2:1 for Apr. 16 expiration.  Most of those puts are big losers right now.  As we get closer to option expiration, those put sellers (market makers) start to unload their hedges (which was to short sell SPX/SPY) against their OTM short puts by buying the stock back as their risk decreases.  They must buy them back to keep their deltas neutral.  This is driven by a 2nd order greek called charm.

Buying back should occur throughout today and next week up until expiration.  While Monday target is 413-413.50 based on the unwinding, it could continue spiking up in a volatile rise throughout next week possibly up to 420.  But the higher it rises beyond 413, the larger the fall should be.  Traders will capitulate into calls and starting next week (possibly as early as Monday afternoon), net market maker flows will reverse as they increase volatility by driving down the price and increase the value of their VIX calls that they've largely already purchased.

VIX currently sits at its lowest level since pre-COVID, where it was around $12.  During the March 2020 peak selloff, VIX hit $85, and recently we've seen local lows of $19.69 (2/10/21) and then $18.68 (3/26).  On 3/31 VIX closed at $18.86 and since then its plummeted as low as $16.20 this morning.  It's due starting next week OpEx window for a significant reversal

[YOLO SPY/VIX positions opened yesterday at close and this morning](https://imgur.com/a/GEY4TTG)

Planning to unload them all between today and Tuesday.  Not financial advice.

Edit: [Update Fri 1:45 EST](https://imgur.com/a/uk20Wn7)

Edit2 3:42 PM EST: Sold the riskiest 45 x SPY $410 4/12 calls bought at open for $0.74 when target hit @ $1.52.  If there is a decent pullback before options close @ 4:15 then I'll buy more FD's for the weekend, otherwise just hold what I still have.  P/L +3,510 (+100%) realized +\~8,500 (+13%) unrealized

Edit3 4:15 PM EST @ SPX/SPY option market close: Didn't end up buying any new calls for the weekend as the pullback turned out to be only just under the target price.  I'll be looking for pullback opportunities on Monday morning for some (slightly) OTM 4/16 calls.  Probably right at open.  May be cheaper than now even with a small weekend gap up due to theta decay.  Strikes maybe 412-414 but do keep in mind that any call positions that are not exited on Monday morning will carry significantly more risk (and reward) than today's calls.

The last industry to sky rocket back to pre-pandemic prices are cruise stocks and once they do, hold on to your butts. Norwegian (NCL) is poised to rebound heavily as they are still drastically down from their prior highs and I feel that soon they will jump back up.

Royal Caribbean (RCL) has told Florida that they will pack their shit up and move their fleet to another country if they aren’t allowed to sail soon. Considering y’all can go to a movie theater now, I feel Florida and the CDC will oblige given the strict rules the industry is now imposing.

NCL is on an upswing in both volume and price considering this move and the plunging wick on the candle today. Telling me it touched lower and would like to begin the ascend back to glory.

I once again will not be sleeping tonight as I toss my $27k at an expiry of tomorrow.

2021-04-08 22:15:31,wallstreetbets,Ncl is bluffing.  US is leading the world in vaccination or very close to the top.  If sailings were to happen it would probably be a US port.  Europe seems to be going back into lockdown mode so I don't see them sailing from Europe anytime soon.  The stock is doing surprisingly well in spite of that.  🤷‍♂️ Wonder how they going to sail with no official vaccine documentation.  That is a tough problem they need to get past.

2021-04-09 19:36:04,wallstreetbets,"Tune in for my next big play next week.

But first, I drink."
2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Two Ways to Play Fannie Mae (and Freddie Mac) A month or so ago I wrote up some DD trying to give people accurate info on the GSEs (government sponsored entities).

That DD can be seen here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkvj3g/fannie_mae_and_freddie_mac_reality_check/

I am writing this up as we have started to see some price action in the assets under these two companies and thought people may appreciate some info.

First off - The two ways I see you can play this:

1. Buy either liquid preferred shares (FNMAS) or the underlying equity (FNMA or FMCC). Your goal is to have liquidity so you can exit your position anytime. You're gonna try do a timing play, buying now and selling before the SCOTUS announcement when the market has conceivably bid up the shares in anticipation. This is of course fraught with all the typical risk of trying to time something as well as believing that more demand is going to take place prior to the trial announcement. You could potentially make 10-30% though in a month based off of what I have seen pre trial announcements in the past.


2. You purchase preferred stock and ride this baby with me come hell or high water. Hell yeah. Preferred stock are the safer vehicle because A. Equity has no place at the negotiation table. B. A lot more good shit has to happen for equity to payoff than the good shit for the preferred. 5x from here on the preferred is good enough for me, that's for sure.

Or you can of course do nothing.

Ok, so what is this all about?

SCOTUS (supreme court of the USA) is about to make an announcement (~1-2 months) saying whether the US Treasury basically nationalized FNMA and FMCC during 2008-2012 and thus owe the shareholders a shit ton of money. However, while they can rule the NWS (net worth sweep) is void, my money is on them backing up the APA claim and sending it to the lower courts for judgement while nullifying MC (Mark Calabria's) job security at the FHFA (the conservator/regulator). 

This would still be very good for the price action, 2-3x from here                              would be awesome. The APA claim is strong and ACTUALLY on the evidence for once, which is extremely damning for the US gov if you read it, if it goes that way, we could still get an early settlement. Although the gov has basically been a nonstop bull dog in this fight, never relenting nor backing down, so it could still be years to actually finalize a resolution.

SCOTUS could also rule completely against plaintiffs. Womp womp, we probably lose about 60-75% from here, and our main last hope would go to a case happening in 2022.

Anyways, that's all, if you had bought during my last post you would have gained a nice 15-20% (edit, someone said they made closer to 30%, nice for them!) already. No idea what happens going forward though."
2021-04-09 08:30:22,wallstreetbets,Been holding The Fannies (FNMA and FNMAS) for almost 5 years now. All I've gotten is fucked in the fanny.
2021-04-08 21:12:42,wallstreetbets,I have been eyeing fnma's stock for a few years. I had a position in it last year. I really feel that the democrats will try to milk this cow for the next 4 years and not let it go

2021-04-08 23:05:41,wallstreetbets,70K FNMA shares and hoping it is removed from gov control. Ripe with fraud since 2008 or so. It is a speculative buy base on realistic valuations of what that kind of company would be worth.

2021-04-08 21:26:05,wallstreetbets,In fmcc. Picked it up at $1.70. Couldn’t resist. Brrrrrrrr now.
2021-04-08 22:02:42,wallstreetbets,"Assume I sniff magic markers as a hobby.  What the heck is that difference between FNMA and FNMAS?  I bought a bunch of FNMA and FNMC, so far they're up nicely."
2021-04-08 23:14:38,wallstreetbets,"Too bad there are no tradable options on FNMA and FMCC, otherwise maybe buying a strangle on them would be the way to go."
2021-04-08 23:33:52,wallstreetbets,"Two ways, buy or don’t buy"
2021-04-08 23:47:35,wallstreetbets,Fidelity has Both. I'm gonna buy some.
2021-04-09 03:10:11,wallstreetbets,"In 2008, treasury provided a backstop to GSE to prevent massive runs on the housing market in an attempt to stabilise both the housing and the broader financial market.
A decade has passed and from the conservatorship, the government has reap a cool 200+ bn in dividends from an cumulative 191bn investments.
There isn’t any plan to release the GSE in the near term, the best president to have done it was Trump. 
The court case is something interesting but I wouldn’t think it’ll rule against the Govt because they did what they could in the midst of the crisis."
2021-04-08 21:41:13,wallstreetbets,Asking for a friend...how does one buy shares of FNMA?
2021-04-08 21:25:30,wallstreetbets,Doesn't democrats milk bulls?
2021-04-09 00:36:57,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, but please be aware of the risks going forward. Once the court case hits we are either gonna take a spanking or be banking. If you don't like your risk levels, start paring it down over the next few weeks."
2021-04-08 22:25:03,wallstreetbets,FNMAS is a preferred share.
2021-04-08 22:23:36,wallstreetbets,By using a real broker
2021-04-08 21:35:01,wallstreetbets,"Yellen recently had a proposal for unrealized gains to be taxed. I don't see how somebody that wants to tax air would let FNMA go. I might be wrong, but I don't want to bag hold this for the next 4 years."
2021-04-09 16:22:18,wallstreetbets,Democrats tax thought.
2021-04-09 00:38:47,wallstreetbets,"Yep, thanks. I'm sufficiently leveraged up to my personal risk tolerance. In seriousness I sold half my position yesterday and am letting the rest ride come what may."
2021-04-08 22:41:31,wallstreetbets,"I'm presently wearing a Walmart bag on my head with like 6 markers inside it so I just breathe in the fumes.  What does the preferred part gain, particularly in this context?"
2021-04-09 00:42:02,wallstreetbets,Good to hear that you cashed in a bit. Gonna make me feel less bad if this goes south as I have always hated the thought of people losing money when I clearly try to outline risks for people.
2021-04-08 23:35:02,wallstreetbets,"Preferred stock is a hybrid form of debt and equity. They have a face value (normally at $25 or $50) and pay a dividend (normally at around 6-8% of face value), and have a set date (normally 5+ years) when the company can buy them back for face value. Preferred shares can also be cumulative ( which means if a company fails to pay a dividend, it has to make up for that missed payment later on) If a company goes bankrupt, preferred shareholders get preference over common shares, but behind debt holders. The Treasury currently holds warrants to buy 79.9% of the twins common stock, which would dilute the hell out of common stock, so theoretically preferred are the safer bet. However, Bill Ackman says that even after this dilution, the twins would still bring in $1.70 per share earnings. Bill estimates that the share price would then hit $23, while Dick Bove places it at $18. However, they would most likely raise additional capital by selling even more shares, diluting commons even more. I’m currently long on both types of shares for FNMA, and only only common stock for FMCC"
2021-04-08 23:51:35,wallstreetbets,"""Also, each GSE contracted to issue common stock representing an ownership stake of 79.9%, at an exercise price of one-thousandth of a U.S. cent ($0.00001) per share, and with a warrant duration of twenty years.""

That sounds kinda favorable.  Glad I'm finding out about this now as opposed to later when the 5x whack comes.

Thank you for the long explanation."

It’s a new beginning for sure. Probably a bumpy ride ahead, but it will land somewhere around $25."
2021-04-08 21:26:45,wallstreetbets,don’t come come crying when robinhood turns off the sell button. We warned you
2021-04-08 21:37:23,wallstreetbets,would’ve made more with a different broker

2021-04-08 23:31:46,wallstreetbets,Curious about the options thing. How are they hammering users on options trading? (Genuinely don’t know. I don’t use options very much.)
2021-04-08 21:46:22,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-09 05:32:28,wallstreetbets,Get ready for a margin call then. RH is also loaning out your shares and will increase your margin maintenance during a drop bringing you into margin call. They share all of you account info with hedges so they work together to force selling at the bottom. Switch to Fidelity cash account.
2021-04-08 21:47:01,wallstreetbets,does it cover your all time realized losses?
2021-04-09 11:35:36,wallstreetbets,Who are you? My margin has been maxed out everyday for over a year. I’m up over 4000%. And I’ve cashed out 10x what I put in. The main reason for this is margin. Is Fidelity the one who dumped their GME? I WANT MARGIN

2021-04-09 00:58:00,wallstreetbets,SQ weeklies.  240c printed like a mfer
2021-04-09 01:39:28,wallstreetbets,"I wanted to double down on my $200 knock-outs last week, but the limit order didn’t get filled 😡"
2021-04-09 04:21:29,wallstreetbets,I’ve been playing SE since 140 range.
2021-04-09 05:16:05,wallstreetbets,"Is SQ still a buy at its current price? I should wait for a dip, I think .."
2021-04-08 20:45:20,wallstreetbets,thats crazy!! were u averaging up?? SQ was at $38-70 levels during march-april 2020.
2021-04-09 00:29:29,wallstreetbets,your wife's bf will be happy
2021-04-08 22:12:14,wallstreetbets,as long as u made gains! thats all that matters but hopefully SE breaks 280 highs and we go 300s <3
2021-04-08 20:50:19,wallstreetbets,do you maximize the up/down action for both stocks by getting calls/puts? or just buy shares and hold?
2021-04-08 22:11:19,wallstreetbets,"what a chad! i really cant stomach weeklies man, hence the jan 2022 haha. grats on your gains!!! was really contemplating on SQ vs SE when they were at 200 last week. went with SE since i had shares since last year lol."
2021-04-09 05:51:20,wallstreetbets,I'd wait a few days after earnings (May 6th) are anounced. Almost certainly dips then
2021-04-08 20:51:57,wallstreetbets,"Had to look it up. Bought it on July 1, 2020 @ $110.99."
2021-04-09 01:05:08,wallstreetbets,"Ha! So folks have it like that, not this guy though. 😎"
2021-04-08 22:24:34,wallstreetbets,I was talking ab SQ but I’ve wanted to take a pos on SE for weeks but never pulled the trigger.
2021-04-08 20:56:05,wallstreetbets,This is a buy and hold position. May do some long calls if market settles a bit.
2021-04-09 17:28:05,wallstreetbets,Yo I'm sitting on 260@ ~15ea 1600% return. This company fucks.

Hopefully the World Cup deal is a good catalyst.  Don't care if it's Gamma squeeze, short squeeze, or people liking the stock.  Hoping for some nice movement.

If it hits $30 or more over the next month I can pay off my house and quit my second job.

2021-04-08 22:58:09,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately I doubt. It's just the qualifies for the world cup. Alot of people don't watch those unless it's a high profile match. Best of luck though

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Nanox: Medical Imaging Disruptor **ABOUT NANOX IMAGING (NNOX)**

* Israeli company that has developed a [digital scanning system](https://www.nanox.vision/our-technology) and medical screening software to replace large/costly machines and software used for X-rays, CT scans, PET scans, and other body imaging services
* NNOX uses a nano-scale, silicon-based field as the X-ray source, as a low-voltage alternative to traditional machines which heat a metal filament to 2000 degrees Celsius
* The main NNOX commercial unit weighs 70kg and costs $10k to produce, compared to current devices which weigh 2000kg and cost $1-3 million
* Reduced heating via cold cathode tech extends machine lifespan
* **Dumbed down for us retards: an X-ray machine that's smaller, cheaper, lasts longer, and uses less power**
* NNOX has 3 main products. A single source NANOX.arc device, a multi source NANOX.arc device (made up of the single source device, this will be the commercial product), and NANOX.cloud (the software subscription that comes along with the device, the recurring revenue stream)
* Has current contracts pending with Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Taiwan, Singapore, Russia, Italy, Belarus, Spain, South Africa, Mexico, and Guatemala. Contract negotiations ongoing others including India, Canada, and the UK
* Has a strategic collaboration agreement with the USA, Korea, and Vietnam
* Partnerships with SK Telecom, Foxxconn, and FujiFilm
* **[FDA recently granted 510(k) clearance for the single source device](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/02/2203966/0/en/Nanox-Announces-FDA-Clearance-of-510-k-for-Single-Source-Nanox-ARC-Digital-X-Ray.html)**, marking a significant milestone for the company and a removal of skepticism brought via 🌈🐻's

**ABOUT MUDDY WATERS**

* NOT the legendary singer / songwriter / father of modern Chicago blues, we're instead talking about the short selling firm **muddy waters research**
* Essentially, muddy waters finds high growth companies, publicly bashes the company, then shorts it relentlessly
* [Muddy in 2019, saying Tesla will go bankrupt.](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/03/01/tesla-will-go-bankrupt-muddy-waters-researchs-cio.html)


**THE SITUATION**

Muddy waters published a NNOX short report in September 2020. It read **""NNOX has no real product to sell other than its stock""**. Essentially calling it a complete scam. They are fairly active on twitter, tweeting about NNOX, at times ramping up activity as they increase their short positions. Typical short seller tactics, calling every product fraudulent and accusing any insider selling stock as proof of a ponzi scheme.

NNOX April 1st closing price was $41.33. Single source **FDA clearance was announced Friday April 2nd** (markets closed due to Jesus). Monday April 5th NNOX opened at $64.00, after hitting $70+ in pre-market. Shares started dropping from this high right at the opening bell and closed at $48.55.

*Enter SSR*

**SHORT SALE RESTRICTION (SSR) RULE**

For those who don't know, when a security **drops 10% or more** (at anytime during the day) from the previous day closing price, SSR is triggered and the opening of new short positions in that security is limited. Under SSR, new short positions can only be opened as stock prices goes up, and this remains in effect until the end of the next day. Essentially **SSR makes it much harder/riskier to short sell successfully.** When a big short seller has enough control of a stock, they can **tactically keep the intraday drop to slightly under 10%, to avoid SSR while maximizing profits**.

On Tuesday, the NNOX low of the day was $43.71, a 9.97% drop from Monday close. That's an extra **0.03% drop away from SSR**. On Wednesday, the low was $40.40, a 9.74% drop from Tuesday close. That's an extra **0.26% drop away from SSR**. Sure we can't rule out this out as a coincidence, so we'll just call it **statistically extremely improbable.**

Despite a disagreement of their thesis from the FDA, muddy appears to be playing their usual games.

**SHORT VOLUME**

If any one of you autists has access to **updated** short interest %, please share. Meanwhile [short volume is here](https://imgur.com/Z79jHw1). Jump in short:volume ratio has sustained post fda approval announcement.

**TODAY**

This morning, there was more positive news for NNOX, involving a partner's (FujiFilm) **[patent filing](https://twitter.com/TerraPharma1/status/1380137316434341890) that would use Nanox rights and IP for innovative mammography equipment**. This news may have helped create a small pop in NNOX price this morning, but once again the shorts squashed any bounce and brought NNOX to even lower levels than yesterday. NNOX closed today at $40.08, a **lower price than it was before FDA clearance**, only three market days after the news. 

**PRICE ACTION**

For anyone familiar with price action when a big short seller is involved, the [NNOX 5 day chart](https://imgur.com/PiFaFfD) paints a pretty clear picture. A gradual slide each day, with any potential peak quickly snuffed out and brought back down to a new low.

**CONCLUSION**

Before Ellen_Degenerate_69 chimes in, you're right, selling on news is nothing new. However, context matters. The majority of the bear thesis hinged on a lack of regulatory clearance. **Recent price action, short volume, and narrow SSR avoidance is all consistent with a big player at the table**. Considering their outspokenness on this company, all signs point towards muddy waters & co.

**TLDR: Nanox (NNOX) has the potential to revolutionize medical imaging, recently reached a milestone with FDA clearance, shares have been dragged down by 🌈🐻’s, and is de-risked at current levels. I like the stock.**

And a stupid squeeze would be so simple due to just how low the float is... but once that Multi Arc gets approved... it’s actually gonna fuck the shorts back to the hole for which Carson came!

2021-04-09 08:29:31,wallstreetbets,"All sounds good, but what makes the current valuation low? $2B is not nothing for a company without revenue. What revenues are we expecting? And when (they don’t have a very long runway left, looks like)."
2021-04-08 20:47:44,wallstreetbets,"I'm a longtime holder of NNOX. I love the tech, but I'd be lying if I said that the shorts haven't gotten to me. Still holding and still believe but at this point I'd give nearly equal weight to a 10x or a 0x scenario. Good enough odds for a position but not a yolo IMO"
2021-04-08 21:53:54,wallstreetbets,This company has been pretty sketchy. Maybe it does have some revolutionary tech but it also seems plausible to me they'll never bring a product to market.

2021-04-08 22:44:19,wallstreetbets,"I hear you, but shorts saying it’s going to 0 is nothing more than a scare tactic at this point. Based off RSNA product demo and now FDA clearance, there is a something here. Timeline and implementation is where the risk lies. The going to 0 theory was based off the product being fraudulent. Due to stock being low float and company being pre-revenue, shorts have control atm. Runway is long."

I think we found the bottom. The shorts are really strong and it’s by both MuddyWaters and Jane Street. Ruthless blood suckers."

Fuji will receive license agreement on the single source which is already patent submitted. This is probably the lowest this stock price will be.

Smells like the mods are to invested in gme to let anyone talk shit or just post about another stock.

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PLTR Demo Day Strategy. 39K to 500K challenge Plus DD. PLTR 39K to 500K challenge by next week. Ive got 39K in calls. Please trust that I play major catalysts all the time and its litterally the only thing Im good at. 

Palantir Double Click Demo Day is 4 trading days away. We all know what happened last demo day. We also know the morning of the friday before demo day we saw a 40 cent drop on open and then from $ 25.50 to $ 32. We've got more outstanding shares now true but it's popped from 23-27 pretty easily even without a demo day in the past month. So Im 100% sure all except my 4-9 calls will print. We are about to breakout of a Descending Triangle. When this happens we pop up to the top of the triangle. Except we are in at least 2 descending triangles. One from $ 30 and one from $ 45 I'd say if we can hold 25 that should do the trick. After that It's 27.50, and then $ 32- $ 36. Might even run a little higher. I don't know if we will break out tomorrow but I didn't want to miss out on 4-9 lotto calls just in case. Definite breakout next week though. Which if people were smart they'd be buying Right Now! Imagine selling 4 days away from a major catalyst at near 50% lows. 

Options have almost no premium and soooo many people have been selling covered calls every day. IT's time to take their shares. Don't sell covered calls before major catalysts.

If you take profit on your ITM calls in the next 3 Trading days, use a portion of those profits to buy even further OTM calls on dips. And keep repeating.

What we want to see is heavy increase volume. Volume has been too quiet. Way too quiet. The trading range has been super tight. 3. Cent moves. This is due to accumulation. And sellers have dried up. We've tested 22.76 support levels twice in two days and it has been rejected both times. So this is a key level to watch. 

 We also want to see the price hold about the 5EMA for a long period of time. Steadily climbing throughout the day.

I've got way to many option chains to post all of them. And I may not be done buying yet. It depends if we get a dip tomorrow. It might also be likely we drop to $21.86 before shooting back up as these are the rules of the decending triangles. The 22.76 support level will be key to watch. And on the upside 24.50-25.17 for a breakout."
2021-04-08 23:43:36,wallstreetbets,"Two things:

1) I think Technical Analysis is about as accurate as phrenology and as successful as Sex Panther (it works 60% of the time, every time) 

2) after the last demo day my personal opinion was that I did not own nearly enough PLTR. The software is spectacular, and their push to make it a seamless integration with legacy software suites is the biggest edge they have. 

So I’m with you on PLTR, just not because of triangles."

2021-04-09 00:06:31,wallstreetbets,Just make sure to buy before demo day and take some profits the morning of demo day when late people are buying at sky high prices.

2021-04-09 08:17:50,wallstreetbets,This confirms my bias.
2021-04-09 13:03:14,wallstreetbets,The best forecasts are
2021-04-09 00:11:30,wallstreetbets,Holding PLTR is like being in an abusive relationship and you keep buying more and saying hit me harder daddy! And then he eventually buys you a BMW after you're done taking months of punishment.
2021-04-08 20:18:51,wallstreetbets,"That's cool. I believe, and I'm 100% sure I'm right. You can play things safe. I'm going to enjoy the ride."
2021-04-08 20:15:17,wallstreetbets,Only a small portion. I've got 300 Further out calls. Some ITM some way OTM.
2021-04-08 20:29:56,wallstreetbets,Looool
2021-04-08 20:17:18,wallstreetbets,Finally a smart option seller. You do not want to sell calls 4 trading days before a major catalyst. You will have to either buy them back or keep rolling them out until the price drops back down. If I'm right and many people have to buy back their calls next week it could further propel things.
2021-04-09 08:08:46,wallstreetbets,"Cathie is always buying PLTR, though and she's in it for the very long term play. I doubt demo day even factors into literally any of her decision, here."
2021-04-09 00:21:55,wallstreetbets,Now this is pod racing.
2021-04-09 16:50:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah they did. Every single of them except the 26's which I didn't sell soon enough.
2021-04-08 22:39:23,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Im not cool enough to be in GME. I did make 10K on AMC but missed the GME train. My business partner bought GME at $40. So jealous. Palantir is the only stock I care about though.
2021-04-08 20:20:07,wallstreetbets,Not fly after demo day. Fly into demo day. Then fall back shortly after to 26.
2021-04-09 01:07:13,wallstreetbets,Something I've been wondering myself
2021-04-09 11:14:12,wallstreetbets,"PLTR valuation is crazy. That said, it feels almost inevitable their market cap will be >$100B (probably more) this decade, implying at least a doubling of share price (again, probably more). I wouldn’t blame anyone throwing 10% of their portfolio at it and just checking back in a few years. Of course there are better short term investments, but who knows how long we will see low $20’s for. Could be a month, could be a year, or we never see them again. Set and forget"
2021-04-08 20:15:56,wallstreetbets,You are a fucking sheep.
2021-04-09 00:16:10,wallstreetbets,Dont fight the spy trend. Wait until the trend changes direction.
2021-04-09 02:45:03,wallstreetbets,Yes dont sell calls 4 days before a catalyst. Wait until after the catalyst is over and sell your calls for way more money.
2021-04-08 22:02:03,wallstreetbets,Who are you? Cramer. This is a casino sir.
2021-04-08 21:38:50,wallstreetbets,All hail the descending triangles!
2021-04-09 08:13:19,wallstreetbets,TSLA
2021-04-08 20:23:04,wallstreetbets,Yes it falls to the bottom of the triangle until it breaks out. Meaning I understand we could drop tomorrow to 21ish levels. And when we Do. I buy even MOAR. I've got another 25K to load in.
2021-04-09 00:21:10,wallstreetbets,Im buying more $25 calls. If I can get them around 30 cents. Litterally anything will print though next week. You could sell puts. If you want to be super safe but deep ITM 2023 calls. Like $10 2023 calls for $14.50
2021-04-08 23:51:02,wallstreetbets,Cause he’s an 🦍
2021-04-09 00:23:32,wallstreetbets,Because Im 100% sure all of my calls will print. And I see 10X gains. Once I make 100% I can let the rest ride.

2021-04-09 08:11:45,wallstreetbets,"I really want to be deeper in PLTR and use its long term sideways travel to make some options-based income. Unfortunately, my brokerage (Fidelity) only approved my account for covered fucking calls. I guess I should have lied and said I've got five years or more of experience with options. Oh well."
2021-04-08 20:41:38,wallstreetbets,"Wait, will you buy more of the 4/9 tomorrow or buy more for the next expiry date?  If they are pennies I may buy a few 4/16"
2021-04-09 00:53:34,wallstreetbets,Thank you. For the $25 call is that April 23?
2021-04-09 00:24:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah what he said because Im an Ape. This is a casino sir. They don't ask why you are betting 40K on black.
2021-04-08 23:49:01,wallstreetbets,Ive bought calls all over the place over 50 chains. The ones ill be buying more of tommorow are 4/16 25 calls. Ive got 110 for 30 cents. Also $10 2023 calls for 14.50.
2021-04-08 20:52:19,wallstreetbets,"I've got like 50 option chains. I can't post them all unless I went to the web robinhood to screenshot which I will but it does show I've got 39K in calls. I've got ITM calls, OTM calls, leaps everything."

2021-04-08 20:16:20,wallstreetbets,Why would a dividend make the stock go up?
2021-04-08 20:17:07,wallstreetbets,"People buy around ex dividend date. Or rather less people sell.

Look at T this week. Ex dividend date was 4/8. I sold my calls 4/7 before the drop."

2021-04-08 20:38:39,wallstreetbets,This guy gets it. I should’ve sold my 4/16 on 4/7 and rolled them into 4/23 on the dip. I have faith it will climb on anticipation of good earnings. So I just bought more and averaged down.

2021-04-08 20:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Lol, how to edit?"
2021-04-08 20:00:16,wallstreetbets,"Wasn't a believer on the DDs here early on. Read about the founder and what other business venture he was indulging. I have friends abroad that have been getting me to buy stuff like $2k Nikes or $5k Adidas or whatsoever on StockX. I was surprised that it was founded by RKT founder. As a business person, I think he is solid and seems to know what he's doing. I researched more into RKT as a company and I think there is potential to streamline the real estate purchasing market, and their potential integration with partnering services etc.

Everything seems to check out as a high potential business but the stock has been trading sideways mostly. At this point, I am going to just keep it out of sight and check back in a year 😂😂."
2021-04-08 20:55:51,wallstreetbets,When people... when... when people start buy.. start buying and selling homes? Dafuq?? Have you stepped outside son or read any news?!
2021-04-08 20:12:46,wallstreetbets,Ouch. But you seem willing to hold.
2021-04-08 20:28:20,wallstreetbets,"Cant edit, must embrace your mistakes"
2021-04-08 20:03:17,wallstreetbets,"What do you know about mortgage backed securities, RKT's default percentage, and their credit score requirements to qualify for a home loan?

What do you know about rehypothecation of mortgage backed securities?"
2021-04-08 21:16:34,wallstreetbets,"Looks like short of houses for sale. The increasing interest rate is alarming, so this will make people rush to refi to lock in rates before it keeps going up. Maybe this will further increases RKT earnings? ...but the stock still trade side ways? 😂"
2021-04-09 09:58:48,wallstreetbets,"Actually home sales have been down.  Feb sales numbers were down ~18%.   No inventory.  

The covid moratorium on foreclosures has also added to this problem.   While saving some, it's also prevented the normally occurring foreclosures from happening."
2021-04-08 20:23:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's ok, I still have additional funds for now."
2021-04-08 20:16:37,wallstreetbets,"I am not an expert, but have read some of this. RKT doesn't seem to be the one funding the mortgage like UWMC, so I wouldn't worry too much about the first part. I have never gotten a loan from RKT, so I don't know what will qualify but I have applied for other loans that require 550 score but fail to qualify for the loan with 780 at the rate that was promised. So I didn't look too much into that either since that might varies? Don't know for sure.

Rehypothecation, again, not familiar within the mortgage business context, but sounds like our Social Security taxes (our taxes is used to fund the older gen, because their taxes is already used up by our govt). Seems like something most business do, but then, not sure. 

My buy in is in their tech stack, which who knows, they might spin that off to a platform/service provider for real estate dealing."
2021-04-08 20:10:34,wallstreetbets,Rehypothecation is the way.
2021-04-08 21:56:18,wallstreetbets,"Unless you got your home at sub 4%  like me, doesn't make sense to refi for 1%. when rates were that low any millennial like me took the leap.

Edit: I also had a baby on the way though so that might have biased my decision"
2021-04-08 20:33:12,wallstreetbets,Be strong. When it moves up a bit you might be able to trim your basis with some OTM covered calls.
2021-04-08 20:34:11,wallstreetbets,"The TLDR is RKT is over leveraged to the tits and once the music stops, they aren't going to have a chair.

Not financial advice, you do you buddy."
2021-04-08 20:13:41,wallstreetbets,Hello Neighbor
2021-04-08 22:33:26,wallstreetbets,"True. My rate is under 3% 30yr, so I will likely not going to for now. It also depends on how much that 1% will save you, so where we are with home prices in the mil, that 1% is quite alot."
2021-04-08 20:35:30,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense. I never really did options before, so I will have to look at that. Thanks for suggesting."
2021-04-08 20:41:08,wallstreetbets,"Yah, I think I have been hearing that for a while already. I don't know which business isn't. Look at all those money losing companies value at higher valuation. At least RKT is still positive there."
2021-04-09 00:01:16,wallstreetbets,"Over leveraged? They’re sitting on $2 billion in cash, nevermind other assets. They made almost $10 billion last year. Biggest mortgage company in the US, been in business more than 30 years and survived worse markets when they were a smaller company than they are today ($45 billion market cap now). Unlike most other mortgage companies they also have other business lines: personal loans, auto loans, business loans, StockX, their own title company, etc. RKT is fine."
2021-04-08 20:50:40,wallstreetbets,"In that case, be extra careful. This is not financial advice. But if I did give financial advice (I don't) then it would be to read a good book on options while you're holding. Add the cost of the book to your holding cost and call it ""tuition."""

2021-04-09 00:17:05,wallstreetbets,"Wtf are you talking about? You think mortgage companies borrow on margin? They’re not trading on robinhood dude. They borrow short term money (days) from other banks and use it to fund loans they close. The fed funds rate is 0.25%, it’s cheap money. After they do a customers loan they sell it at a premium in secondary and pay their own short term loan off. They only borrow money when a loan is closing so it’s not like they’ll get stuck borrowing money they can’t turn around and re-lend. It’s a literal cash machine."

So since he has 100% of his assets in GME it shows that his diversity of THIS stock is 100%. That's an easy way to see he is truly yoloing everything. You can work backwards too, if you see someone show their say AMC shares and it is 10k usd but 20% of their diversity then you can find out that they have 50k usd total invested in that portfolio account. as 10/.2 = 50k

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My First YOLO: 18k on $GME (Using combinations of 420 and 69) What could go wrong? &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jma78u7rq0s61.png?width=2042&format=png&auto=webp&s=04d26706464b98106347c0a0775974b12acc4cb2

I joined WSB a while back after seeing DFV's updates. I love to gamble, but have always played it safe with index funds - probably out of laziness more than anything. The GME vs hedge fund narrative got me excited and I knew I wanted to be a part of history.

So I bought 125 shares at around $60.

https://preview.redd.it/wstw0wf2s0s61.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=6836e5261d16411b6801da9981c5b28b9a080b22

Fast forward a couple of months - I've learned how options work, laughed my ass off at a lot of memes, and received a little stimmy money from the good ole US-of-A that's been burning a hole in my pocket.

So I decided to YOLO that money + some extra into $GME calls and shares.

Here's what I bought and why:

* **4 20**0c  (4/23) -- DFV's 500 12c are expiring next week, which he will probably exercise (because he's a legend). Hopefully, he posts his YOLO update before 4/23 🚀
* 2 **420**c  (7/21)-- June 9th (**6/9**) Shareholder meeting could result in a stock recall or reverse stock split 🚀
* **6 9**00c (1/21/22) -- Since we can't predict exactly when GME will moon, we might as well bet on long calls and/or hold shares 🚀
* 10 more shares at 1**69.69** \- I like the stock and 69 🚀

TLDR: Used an unsophisticated combination of 420 and 69 to buy GME calls and shares based on limited DD and retarded ape logic."
2021-04-08 20:07:33,wallstreetbets,Good job fellow autistic ape. Remind me when those calls get exercised

2021-04-09 11:38:09,wallstreetbets,The math checks out
2021-04-09 12:00:05,wallstreetbets,Just buy and hold shares. Doing options introduces liquidity into the system which lessens pressure on the hedge funds. We all want the squeeze to squoze.

2021-04-09 01:06:27,wallstreetbets,"So far I’ve made about 10k and right now working on the 4k. I plan to buy it back tomorrow morning and just make the 2k. And only if price starts to move up tomorrow 

I kept selling and then buying back on the dip, and buy more shares.  Got caught 2 times and had to rebuy in.  

But I’ve made all my loses back from other tech stocks since the dip. Just playing GME. 

And I do the July cc at 300 or less right now.  But I was doing weeklies for 2 weeks but it seems like premium is lower since it’s been flat for a week.  

If it’s up and down a lot I’ll do weeklies.  And now I have 200 shares, when I started with 100, and half my money was in tech stocks.  So I cashed out and played GME for now.  I’m still just having fun."

The company is run by smoother brained fucks than Citadel and Robinhood. The cannabis industry is (hopefully) breaking out soon so it’s not a bad bet but if you’re interested in that sector there’s other companies that have much better business strategies and aren’t always showing crazy losses with no promise of ever getting in the black anytime soon."

2021-04-08 22:06:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm def not one of them. I did try. I firmly believed that with legalization and more acceptance that we would see far better than what we saw. The problem is that I don't go to a dispensary because the fuckin taxes are almost as much as the weed is. So I go to a friend who doesn't charge me tax, if I want an ounce I pay for it. I think that's the main way you're gonna get fucked on weed stocks unless you're on an actual investment level, like $100,000 or more into it, which I wasn't anyway. It's going to be really hard once it's federally legalized because you'll have private sellers that aren't going to collect tax on sales. People will grow their own if they have to at that point. 

We missed the weed stock boom after California and Oregon started doing Medical. That was the entry point. If you missed that, THAT was the ""chance to make millions"" but no one I know has made millions on weed stocks, so...."

2021-04-09 02:54:40,wallstreetbets,"I own both Volvo and BB shares because I like their stock. By the way, Volvo cars and Volvo AB are two different companies after Ford then Geely acquired Volvo Cars. I own AB Volvo who makes the trucks, cranes and construction equipment. With minerals and mining going up, I’m getting heavy on Volvo. Also because of European (and global) infrastructure spend and stimulus.

As for BB, I have a DD that I still stand by. Got $30c by end of year."

I am even more bullish since there was a bunch of shorts and the price increased pretty quickly so they're gonna probably be giving more discounts or it's gonna pop off for a bit."
2021-04-09 02:57:27,wallstreetbets,BB is on its way. I expect it to continue to surprise with new partnerships and tech until it becomes an industry standard once again. I think a lot of people round these parts just thought of it as another meme stock.

2021-04-09 13:32:32,wallstreetbets,"Also, Volvo is on a roll"
2021-04-08 21:30:44,wallstreetbets,"> Volvo 

Sold over 1.2m cars in 2020 which was a decrease from 2019 by quite a lot, like almost 500k... I imagine that their business will pick up. Also, they make other types of machinery besides just cars. Like tractors, dump trucks, and fork lifts. Are all those commercial vehicles going to be using this software?

The article also lists many services that appear to be separate, I very much doubt that this is a $50 seat license. I imagine that it's probably expensive and comes in an entire package because it seems to include autonomous stuff and many user interactive tools. These features usually come in like a few grand a piece packages or included on really expensive cars...."
2021-04-08 22:25:53,wallstreetbets,"Take your estimate of $50/seat.  If it’s in 175M cars, that’s $875M ARR of probably fairly high margin revenue.  If the company is valued at $5B, that’s a pretty hefty discount considering QNX is only one product line"

2021-04-09 00:22:14,wallstreetbets,"Not normally, QNX is used in all sorts of devices, but it's just an OS with specific features for real time operation in embedded applications, especially when there's very low resources.  It's not an application.  It's popular for building ATMs, and drones because it's very stable in terms of providing high uptime, but it's just an OS around which you develop software, and one that hasn't competed as well lately as Linux has become a a dominant platform for embedded systems due to it's better hardware support and ease of use that makes it ""good enough"".  Blackberry already claims 150M cars already use QNX in 2019, and about 30M new seats per year so what's another 1M if every Volvo uses it?  A drop in the bucket that sounds great on a press release but isn't anything of true significance."
2021-04-09 00:27:42,wallstreetbets,"That's probably retail, but considering they already selling 30M seats a year in 2019, we're talking about 3% increase in their automotive segment annual sales.  Only.

2021-04-09 13:36:17,wallstreetbets,Dude said Volvo sold half a million cars. Was just pointing out that was incorrect. I know it was with their commercial vehicles which is what I was pointing out.
2021-04-09 00:34:18,wallstreetbets,"I know exactly what QNX is.... I am an embedded systems engineer... I mean bro, I literally gave you an easy tee up for the first line of the article... I have to disagree with your assessment. Even if they only made $50 per vehicle, which let's be honest that's ridiculous and not even close to that low. That's still a $15m/yr contract for software. I think it's significantly higher than that. Also, added a second quote for what Volvo said about the deal, because they seem to think that it's a good partnership. I bet if it goes well they expand it to more vehicles because they seemed to have picked it to do just that...

> the software provider said Volvo had selected its QNX architecture to power its heavy-duty trucks, buses, and construction equipment.

> “Engineers building on BlackBerry QNX can write software for a wide range of applications with a common application programming interface,” Volvo said.
> “BlackBerry is well aligned with the automotive challenges within electrification, automation and connectivity and the technical solutions needed in these domains,” Mark Mohr, Volvo's senior vice president for vehicle technology, said."

2021-04-09 13:43:02,wallstreetbets,"Ah!

Sorry about this, I misunderstood you on that"
2021-04-09 15:36:55,wallstreetbets,">Even if they only made $50 per vehicle, which let's be honest that's ridiculous and not even close to that low.

It's way closer to $5000 than $50"
2021-04-09 01:39:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's a possibility that this is a deal with Geely which would get much more volume but frankly the seat costs aren't that high and a million a year volume is a drop in the bucket.  Hardly a reason to bet on BB based on this news.  The numbers aren't there. If they had a deal with Geely, they wouldn't have said Volvo.   QNX will be used for embedded systems like speedos, hvac and other i2c embedded systems, not entertainment, navigation or autonomous tech, you won't squeeze a $50 seat license out of that easily, that's a ceiling.  Even the entire patent portfolio for smartphone technologies costs manufacturers about $10/device to Google when QNX fits that narrow gap between PICs and high functionality but non critical systems that run on Linux, and critical but commodity systems provided by supply chain vendors like Bosch, I don't see how they would be spending that much."
2021-04-09 13:10:34,wallstreetbets,"But, but... my calculations have BB at $50 in a few years (well, actually today, - and actually 50+! - depending on what competing firm you compare it to). I'll be cut short with $25! 

Now, i am not a greedy man. I'll accept $49 today to save me from waiting 3 years, but $25??"
2021-04-08 20:38:17,wallstreetbets,I agree. Every paycheck a little bit goes into it.
2021-04-09 00:36:58,wallstreetbets,"Yea, BB doesnt belong in this casino as its more of a long term play"
2021-04-09 00:52:23,wallstreetbets,This is the mindset people need to have with gme. Although I don't think it'll go beyond 500. But sit tight and see what happens over the next couple years.
2021-04-09 01:43:30,wallstreetbets,"So you didn't actually read the article then? Because it clearly says that autonomous driving and user interactions will be features, even the BB press release had that. Have a good day friend!"
2021-04-09 15:34:49,wallstreetbets,"I'm greedy, I'll accept nothing less than $500/share"
2021-04-09 14:10:03,wallstreetbets,Could be more.. this is just a guess at the offer.
2021-04-09 01:57:49,wallstreetbets,"I saw Future Support for Autonomous driving, which was far as I know isn't a feature set of QNX today any more than it is a feature set of Linux. That reads to be that QNX is the OS provider and Volvo is developing the hardware and software to make autonomous driving. That's not a value add for QNX justifying a higher license fee. Any more than QNX is contributing to the functionality of space vehicles which are currently running QNX. They're still the OS provider, not the application or hardware stack provider.  They might make an effort to support ethernet based communication interfaces to supplant i2c to make that possible or support newer SoCs but that's about it."
2021-04-09 02:01:05,wallstreetbets,"Nah see that's where you're missing it. Read up on BB QNX car safety, it's a system for autonomous driving by BB. The other part is that it connects with the existing user interface systems for like every manufacturer, they're (Volvo) saying that it should be in use for at least 15 years in a vehicle line.

EDIT: Clarify they're."
2021-04-09 02:23:11,wallstreetbets,"No I think it's still the correct assessment, they provide safe interfaces for controls and automation, but not the actual functionality. The strength of QNX is it's strong resource management and reliability in process isolation, which is why they are advertising safe interfaces. It's a good platform which is why companys have used it for mission critical systems but they aren't building the functional blocks of an automated driving systems, but an OS that ensures the applications installed don't have prioritization issues so that your real time systems like your driving logic are never delayed by the music player or navigation software. They are focusing on their core strength by adopting support for automotive standard interfaces and hardware to make a friendly and open platform to develop in but their marketing documentation ends there.  They talk about certification, security, mixed criticality and reliability. These are the features of their OS, and their safe user interface and control platform.  If they were selling machine vision our self driving features it would be in their brochure. Instead it's a secure OS to run in the various ECUs handling simple systems like ADAS, infotainment and instrument clusters while adding telematics. At least according to their website.  This is to make things like OTA updates and sending telemetry back from all the ECUs simpler and secure by having a single vendor OS managing all the separate controllers on a vehicle as a single network rather than each ECU running whatever software is provided by the dozen or so manufacturers which operate independently with different in line programming capabilities and addressing requirements.  Like Linux but more stable and having a vendor committed to working with the hardware suppliers on interoperability.  That's no nvidia or cruise."
2021-04-09 02:45:05,wallstreetbets,"So in other words, even though it runs on both those chips and even had boards that are made to buy for it, it's not a system? Also, it provides the framework for autonomous driving, where you only need to write it once for all your lines of vehicles even if they use completely different boards. I think you don't understand what it is. Yes it's an operating system but it's also the entire framework to just stick a bunch of stuff in and write less code, theoretically the autonomous software has no idea it's even in different vehicles."
2021-04-09 11:41:11,wallstreetbets,"It's a system in the sense it provides the OS, a UI module for touch screen controls, a TCP stack, a VPN service for remote updates, support for CANBUS over TCP/IP.  It's probably providing specs for hardware manufacturers to integrate with it.  It provides specifications that customers and manufacturers can choose to adopt, or not.  But it's not a system like waymo which provides a hardware specification and supporting software stack for data fusion for GPS, lidar, video, sonar, radar, a stack for automated driving logic, (all the complicated proprietary software that you layer on top of the OS).  Porting that software between OS's is not as difficult as building those proprietary systems.  This system isn't terribly different than what VW has built for their ID platform (admittedly it has issues but is at least a system put into production and working out their kinks in a live product), and whatever Ford, GM, MBZ and VW group use in their EVs that provide remote update capabilities meaning there are already production and established competitors in this space driving and establishing their own standards.  I am specifically referring to EVs because I don't think there's any interest in investing into legacy support for OTA and enhanced systems integration for ICE vehicles so every major manufacturer that has an EV in the market is not going to be a QNX customer because of these new features. These manufacturers all have their suppliers committed to supporting their current system, and these platforms will have at least a 10 year shelf life with only a cosmetic refresh at 5 years.  If QNX is used in these platforms, they're either not allowed to disclose (and their revenue is already baked into their existing price) or they built upon an older version of the OS that was not specifically marketed to autos, or integrated (like their 2019 report) within individual subsystems only.  Now we haven't heard much out of Japan so if QNX is adopted by any of those brands, it will gain support by Denso, etc and spread throughout the supply chain but Japan is more likely to partner up with other japanese companies to keep this  a national strategic product.  So we have a product that will be in Volvos and other geely products (Chinese EVs that have an even lower margin than Volvos, and I think Lotus which will stay mostly ICE due to the lightness tenet).  If QNX turns out to be very successful, I think that Geely is likely to purchase this product line from BB to market to other chinese manufacturers for standardization with other domestic brands, but this will happen before BB becomes too expensive, and investors will be cut out before it spreads widely in China.  This is due to China's national commitment to become a leader of EV manufacturing which means minimal dependency on foreign owned technology vendors."
2021-04-09 11:52:31,wallstreetbets,"So doing all that research has you come to the same conclusion as me, huh?"
2021-04-09 12:05:45,wallstreetbets,"Not a lot of research, it's common knowledge for those interested in EVs in the software/hardware development community, and in the end, it doesn't sound like it's a great pick.  It's a small fish trying to get a piece of the pie that already has established incumbents with a 5 year lead and landing a small contract with hopes of being acquired.  It's not going to increase it's revenue significantly in the next few years because it is only offering a small set of services and not providing any critical pieces of the self driving solution.  It isn't providing anything that adds to the company's patent portfolio, as it's all prior art in other industries like mobile.  If it has good performance, it will be purchased before investors benefit significantly so it's not a good long bet because of China being the interested party (and they are just as likely to clone the product than to buy BB to be honest).  QNX is a good and established platform, but it's main benefits with efficient resource management are becoming less important as you can get a basic SoC with as much performance and resources as a PC from 10 years ago in a tiny package that can replace pics with a full networking stack.  QNX's strengths are not as valuable as it once was unless you're building spacecraft running on solar and nuclear batteries.  Arguably real time linux would be easier and cheaper to use but without the long history of QNX.  Eventually it will have that history."
2021-04-09 12:08:39,wallstreetbets,"> Not a lot of research

Honestly, you're killing me here... I'm not sure whether you are trying to convince yourself you made the right decision, convince others to sell, or if you're just messing with me...."
2021-04-09 13:20:07,wallstreetbets,"I'm not invested in BB either way, but i'm pretty active in Tesla forums, I used to mod sports cars, and I'm an EE so this stuff is pretty interesting to me.  I just don't think it's really such a great pick, considering there's other bigger opportunities with Biden's electrification push.  Still trying to find out where those investments are likely to land."

2021-04-08 20:26:34,wallstreetbets,"GET RICH or go broke trying. A wise investor realizes that the further the price drops the less risky a stock is. Especially before a major catalyst, and super tight 30 cent moves and consolidation. Meaning it's about to break."
2021-04-09 16:53:55,wallstreetbets,MOON!
2021-04-08 22:13:23,wallstreetbets,Nope. Actually buying $10 2023 calls for 14.50 is better. You break even at 24.50 and pay half the price. Plus assuming we are over 24.50 in 2 years. Youll get hella premium.
2021-04-09 16:53:37,wallstreetbets,Guess I'm not on food stamps.
2021-04-09 00:59:20,wallstreetbets,Sell me some more 0.25% premium calls then.
2021-04-09 05:05:17,wallstreetbets,"Until we shoot up 30% next week. Then they will scramble to buy their calls, cover naked calls and roll calls out further."
2021-04-09 04:56:05,wallstreetbets,Only 5K worth is expiring today. Judging by premarket data. I should be able to take that 5K out in profits on open and let the rest ride. Instead of taking 10K out and rolling it further out. The other calls I have further out are 100% gains at least. I like the thrill of same day expirations. I do it for the kicks.

2021-04-08 22:27:16,wallstreetbets,Pltr leaps are super duper cheap. It’s a no brainer to buy them since the stock has low vega
2021-04-09 09:24:49,wallstreetbets,Ya but why say 3 days then
2021-04-08 21:55:58,wallstreetbets,I actually messed up the title and cant change it. 39K to 500K in 3 trading days. Maybe 4-5. Maybe a week.
2021-04-08 21:42:17,wallstreetbets,I hope you do. I like the conviction. I'm in

2021-04-09 00:31:42,wallstreetbets,Did it only move up once this week? 1 up day per week is clearly too much for PLTR.
2021-04-09 07:37:37,wallstreetbets,Umm you expire today
2021-04-08 20:54:04,wallstreetbets,"Good luck my man, Godspeed."
2021-04-08 20:10:12,wallstreetbets,Only a small portion of the calls are next day.
2021-04-08 22:31:11,wallstreetbets,I was selling CC’s for a while when IV was really high.  Made some good money.  Really need PLTR to rise in the next week to help fund my tax bill
2021-04-09 00:41:15,wallstreetbets,I love this comment but yes I am positive on my calls and I even took some small profits today.
2021-04-08 21:13:39,wallstreetbets,Honestly though their price didn’t move much on their last demo day.
2021-04-08 22:31:50,wallstreetbets,"Actually I filled 1000 4/16 30/35c spreads at .02 today and 500 5/7 spreads same strike for .12.

2021-04-09 01:35:06,wallstreetbets,I did the research and it’ll easily be worth more than DKS already as is. And if they expand into the states DKS is in they are done for.. i don’t see many DKS stores in Texas no more probably cause Academy is much better and they still sell guns and ammo unlike DKS. And Academy is always packed asffff

Obviously ASO has been having weird after market action, but I don't see why Biden's executive order couldn't have increased prices.  Democrats are good for gun sales.  The fear of losing access to desired guns/ammo has been the biggest boon for guns and ammo sales.  Dick's took the no guns approach, which means ASO gets more sales."
2021-04-08 22:28:56,wallstreetbets,who is this ‘we’ you speak of?
2021-04-08 22:42:37,wallstreetbets,WTF is going on? I logged in to fidelity and saw my account bleeding out this morning and decided to go spend time with my dog and weep about lost retirement funds. Now it's up? WTF?
2021-04-08 23:14:54,wallstreetbets,Dick’s took the woke approach
2021-04-08 22:48:26,wallstreetbets,My first down vote!! Whoop whoop!! That’s exactly what I was implying. Whenever a Dem says gun control everyone runs out to buy guns and ammo. Where I live there are lines out the door waiting to buy ammo every day.
2021-04-08 23:07:07,wallstreetbets,Regular traders i guess? Who is able to trade outside of normal trading hours and why is it just them?
2021-04-09 13:02:43,wallstreetbets,How is no guns policy woke? It’s the opposite
2021-04-08 23:12:25,wallstreetbets,"Those lines have been there since the beginning of the pandemic.  The grief right now is that there's not been any meaningful stock since then either. 

They're can't be a bigger run on guns and ammo than there has already been because its been sold out.

On the other hand, manufacturers are charging more, and stores are charging more.  How that effects the stores GP is another thing."

I rushed into it probably too quickly but after a deeper insight, I'm not quite sure about its valuations. Ever since 2017 it's having a downward trend, all the way to \~$35 and that bothers me a bit. Although it's definitely an established business with long history that, (unlike many hyped SPACs) is actually generating both revenue and earnings, I believe post-Covid valuation (with all the high valuations) is in the $40-50 range. What I wanna say is I do not expect a significant pop, however I'd be one happy ape if you prove me wrong."

2021-04-08 22:56:58,wallstreetbets,"Or as the Brits would say.... ""Crack On"""
2021-04-09 06:26:53,wallstreetbets,"The problem I have and others have, is we keep expecting this to blow up within the next 1-2 weeks. With all the DD's from the beginning saying ""oh this is the NUMBER 1 CATALYST FOR MOASS"" or ""THIS IS THE SURE FIRE THINGIE TO START MOASS"" and when those dates or events pass and no MOASS people ever so slightly get discouraged.  Issue with that is the hedgies also see this expectation and they are pushing things back, kicking the can further down the road. 

Think about it from the perspective of the hedgies. BILLIONS and perhaps TRILLIONS are on the Line. WOULD YOU GIVE UP EASILY? No, these HFS are so use to ALWAYS WINNING and ALWAYS COLLECTING that they will fight tooth and nail to keep their ill gotten gains. They'll keep going and heck, they'll probably start taking out loans to keep going for as long as possible for as long as they can.  

They will use every trick legal and illegal, just imagine HFS's saying ""oh no we're broke we give up"" and the rocket doesn't blast off so people sell. Honestly it's a waiting game, people need to be aware that this could take months or even dare i say a few years. 

Not financial advise, but I just have a feeling that if MSM didn't keep spouting that GME was dead and it was a crappy company, then I probably would have ignored it and went on with my life accepting my fate of working for the next 35 to 45 years so I can possibly retire with a few funds so I can die in a retirement home. 

Things will change if you're patient and that's life advice not financial advice."

2021-04-09 06:30:03,wallstreetbets,"So a big misunderstanding about short squeezes on this subreddit. Rarely do you get to just squeeze them out by hurting their books so much that they get margin-called and are forced to buy.

It can happen when the stock goes up to something like 1400% of course. But even this can often be hedged. This is the real reason we see so many crazy OTM calls. If the stock goes higher, the value of the short position goes down, but the value of the calls goes up. Meaning it no longer hurts their margin as much as it normally would. Since if you lose 10% on your short position on a given day from a stock price increase, the value of your calls might double from the IV and whatnot. So you aren't as likely to get margin called.

Of course, these calls have a price to them too, hedging isn't free, but it's often worth it for the additional margin and safety.

The way short squeezes normally work is lending interest. If a fund shorts a stock, they have to barrow those shares. But you can't borrow for free. So you need to pay interest on those short positions. Eventually, the interest you pay will overcome any amount of gains you can make, and it no longer makes sense to continue to hold that position. You decide to throw in the towel and go home, and the last to go home has the highest price to pay to close their position.

Gamestop is unlikely to see another 1400% rise in stock price. Given that such a rise would make it the largest company in existence.

This could happen if supply and demand are fucked up. But normally economics will tell us that most people SHOULD sell if the price goes above a certain amount. The idea is everyone has a price they'd be willing to sell at. If this assumption is wrong, which can be if enough people are motivated for reasons other than monetary gain, then there could be no upper limit in the price of the stock. Of course, large amounts of GME are held by insiders and hedges that are motivated for sure by monetary gains, so they would sell at some point.

But even on this subreddit, the idea people are wanting or asking for the price to go higher means lots of people despite the diamond hand memes are looking for a payday. Or they have put themselves into an economic position where if they don't sell they will feel financial pain themselves. Which in itself, makes it more likely people will sell.

Personally, I've purchased 1 share of GME, and plan on never selling. But for the price to skyrocket another (+1400% increase), we need 100 million other shares to be held this way.

So back to the question, how long? Weeks to months to even years perhaps. It really depends on the shorts. How long are they willing to hedge themselves? How long are they willing to pay the lending interest?"

2021-04-08 21:06:58,wallstreetbets,"LOL. I've made literal tens of thousands swing trading the last two weeks, because GME is (almost) uniquely volatile, has long term potential (because RC etc) which hedges risk, and is increasingly trading in a tighter range where there is still the potential to make 4 or 5 dollars a share. Over 600 or 800 shares a time, that's real money. I've now bought in again with 685 shares at around 175 and expect those to pop to maybe 210 to 220 in the coming days - then it will retreat once more, I will rinse and repeat.

There is no MOASS. The short interest on the stock is 4.06%. It has had its squeeze twice, and even then lightning striking twice is pretty rare.

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Honest thoughts on AMC? Hold or sell? I purchased 5000 shares of AMC in early January when it was around the $2 range feeling that 2021 has to be the year things go back to normal and the year we defeat COVID. My thought process in purchasing AMC was that people will want to go back to theaters, there are plenty of AMC theaters all around the country, the impending summer blockbuster movie season and that COVID 19 vaccine rates are ramping up all over. 

I took profits at around the $18 mark in late January but held onto 3000 shares with hopes things will do better for the long term. Based on your analysis and thoughts how to you think AMC will fare in the coming weeks and months? Would it be advisable for me to hold or just sell since I will still be able to turn a good profit based on the current market price? 

Thanks!"
2021-04-09 11:58:49,wallstreetbets,Never ask WSB what they think of AMC. Buncha fucking haters. I for one have faith in AMC and it’s community.

Counterpoint is the board is using investors for fat bonuses and diluting stock and thats bad"
2021-04-09 00:17:16,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I can't think of one good reason to own this stock any longer. I owned it from 2$ and got out around $15 when it spiked in January, then bought back in and averaged down to $9, then got out at $14 a couple a weeks ago.

A few things have happened during this time period have happened that has caused me to turn bearish, and I think people should pay attention to them, so I'll lay them out.

1. Nearly 350 million more shares have been sold to the open market between late 2020 and today. This is 4 times the amount of shares available when the stock was trading near $2. This also cuts any short % of float by 4X as well which takes away any potential mechanics for a further ""short squeeze"".
2. The company has 6 billion in debt, much of that debt is at double digit interest rates since their credit rating (CCC+) is awful, yet most new investors are voting against the company's right to sell more stock (500 million more shares) which would liquidate much of their debt if the current price is maintained, and put the company in a better position to actually be profitable. You're kind of screwed either way their vote goes.  
3. Their business model has been steadily declining for years, and they're market share is being eaten away more and more each day to streaming services. Movie makers aren't going to sit on all these movies forever in hopes for a major comeback, we've already witnessed many anticipated releases get released to Disney and HBO Max. 
4. Today this stock is trading near a 5 billion market cap, that's 1 billion higher than when the stock traded at an ATH around of $35 in early 2017 with just over 100 million shares outstanding, for the stock to hit the price of $35 today, investors will need to buy 11 billion more dollars worth of shares, which is highly unlikely. I've noticed some pretty cringe posts on other subs that uses past prices, or other company's prices to compare to AMC's current price, and it scares me to know that so many are buying stocks without any understanding of how a stock arrives at it's price.
5. All the bonuses and share selling from executives. Even the insiders know this price is asinine, and they've been taking advantage of you by cashing in.
6.  Squeeze metrics- GME had around 140% of float shorted in it's prime, if you know anything about how a short squeeze works, this is really a poster child for a short squeeze. AMC on the other hand, has only ever had 11% to 13% or so of short % of float through all of this. Additionally, the amount of float to shares outstanding indicates that there are still a significant amount of shares available, meaning ""Hedgies"" aren't rushing in to cover their short positions because the demand will never outpace the shares available, and definitely won't need to if another 500 million shares are sold.

 Now, I'm sure most AMC holders didn't want to hear any of that, and I really do hope that you guys make life changing money, all I'm saying is you should consider these things, it's always wise to make both cases for a stock you hold, and to go with your instincts. Don't expect some guy on YouTube to help make your money, he's already getting paid with people hanging on his every word.

**TL/DR:** AMC done, get out while you can."
2021-04-09 00:20:48,wallstreetbets,"Hold. The DD I've read is promising for a squeeze. Short interest is high (30-40% if I recall), utilization rate going up from 80's to now 93%, it's largely owned by individual investors, and if GME goes on a run typically AMC will as well. Definitely seems there's a lot of coordinated FUD going on for its down days. Selling covered calls can be profitable as well.

Edit: Plus the CEO seems to very much support the reddit community. He's old and doesn't know how to do it properly but it's intriguing."
2021-04-08 20:10:19,wallstreetbets,AMC is currently at its all time high enterprise value and market cap. Do you think the company’s prospects are literally the best they’ve ever been? Burning $100M cash a month and theaters won’t be at 100% capacity nationwide for a long time.

2021-04-09 18:59:31,wallstreetbets,"Personally I'd say so but I have a few reasons for that. For one AMC blew up right about the same time GameStop did, the difference is GameStop has announced a forward-thinking plan but AMC paid their executives more and gave bonuses. They sold shares during the squeeze to skim any profit they could. It's also a movie theater and I get that they're trying to sell an experience but their experience cost me and my girlfriend anywhere from 50 to $75 just to go. I went as a kid and I understand the sentiment but it's too expensive it won't survive. If you want to be playing with AMC buy blocks of 100 shares and sell contracts and when the underlying decides to take a turn for the worst get out."
2021-04-08 21:02:04,wallstreetbets,"I went in for 4 figures a while ago. I am taking the Cuban approach - my reasons for buying haven’t changed, so I’m holding. 

I am confident sometime in the next year - when post COVID euphoria is everywhere and the bottleneck of Hollywood blockbusters is released like a torrent - the major theatre chains are then going to be putting up the best quarterlies they’ve had in many years. People want to go the movies again. The stonk will explode up and I will be buried in tendies and powdered donuts.

Also, short squeeze. But that’s not why I bought it."

It feels a little cult-ish, but I’ve experienced so much fuckery with my own eyes that it can’t be a coincidence. The fundamentals— that it’s massively shorted, people want to go to the movies, institutions keep opening new positions and it’s no longer on the verge of bankruptcy— keep me hanging in there, to quote our boy DFV.

2021-04-09 01:13:11,wallstreetbets,Blank the Dip!
2021-04-09 13:51:12,wallstreetbets,Amc is a turd 💩that should be flushed. It wasn’t worth owning before the pandemic and is even less attractive now.
2021-04-09 11:07:21,wallstreetbets,I like the stock. Bought some more today while under $10. This should exist around $20 come fall is my hope.
2021-04-09 17:42:03,wallstreetbets,If you didn't sell at 14$ a few weeks ago why would you sell now around 9$??? Fucking retard
2021-04-09 18:54:33,wallstreetbets,To that I'd say are there any movie theaters that are doing well?
2021-04-08 20:41:55,wallstreetbets,That’s what I been doing $200 a week has been nice
2021-04-08 20:56:30,wallstreetbets,"This is the way.
Also my 9.50 puts are profitable. Not gonna exercise, but between selling covered calls and playing with call/put I've brought my disastrous cost basis down"
2021-04-09 01:56:58,wallstreetbets,"Most of the gme-tards and amc-tards are too retarded to think that.

Shorting call options for them is the ultimate sin lmao."
2021-04-08 20:07:36,wallstreetbets,How many shares did you buy today?
2021-04-08 21:54:19,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-08 20:00:06,wallstreetbets,Holding and buying till  I own majority share so I could really show you all it's potential
2021-04-09 11:02:38,wallstreetbets,"holy crap, a sensible post about why amc isn't gOinG tO tHe moOn that isn't downvoted like crazy! miracles do happen!"
2021-04-09 12:54:50,wallstreetbets,"It might be slightly undervalued ($15 PT is pretty reasonable) but the income from selling calls on the 3000 shares is still pretty reasonable, given that it is likely to stay between 9 and 10.

I would sell if the demand for movies slows, it hits 8, or the call income becomes too small."
2021-04-09 01:32:36,wallstreetbets,"All the things you said seem cool but streaming will never take over the movies.  Much like cds, mtv, YouTube,  videos of concerts, streaming... will never replace an actual concert. 

A lot of people believe the idea brick and morter will get eaten by streaming or online services.    True with blockbuster, but going out to rent a movie was a chore.  Yes, all chores can be replaced.   Amazon can replace walmart.  Chore.  Netflix can replace blockbuster.  Chore. HBO can't replace movies.   It's not a chore, its a date night.  Its how you get p666y. Its not going to a person's house (or letting them come to yours) when you first meet to stream a movie from your television.   Not just a trust thing, or a weinstein attempt, but some younger folks can't have a bf over.  It's high school girls not allowed to have a boy over or vice versa.  They choose an alternative,  the movie experience. 

Now, does anything I said mean amc is more valuable?   Nope.  But throw that fud idea of movie theaters being replaced out.  No.  As long as we want p666y, the movie theaters are safe.  And cds, YouTube, MTV, didn't replace a concert either.    A chore is replaceable, an experience and night out is not. 

My 2.  No, I have no shares of amc and actually feel the 10 to 14 dollar range is accurate.   Under 5, I'd buy."
2021-04-09 03:05:26,wallstreetbets,"You are wrong.

&#x200B;

AMC is buy&hold still while worst case might be a long-term hold

&#x200B;

\*edit: for the downvoters: I think this play is a valid play and everyone's personal situation is to be respected."
2021-04-09 11:05:52,wallstreetbets,seriously.  even gme has better prospects at its current price
2021-04-08 20:05:17,wallstreetbets,"YO! YOU REALLY THINK HOLLYWOOD WOULD SPEND ALL THAT MONEY ON THEATRICAL RELEASES IF PEOPLE WERE NOT GOING TO SEE THEM???????? LOLOLOLOLOL...  Omg so sorry. I didnt realize i was YELLING IN YOUR STUPID FACE!!!!!!! HAHA!

Godzilla Vs Kong broke 40mil... Fu** off."
2021-04-09 13:16:15,wallstreetbets,"Comparing AMC to Cinemark makes AMC worth about $15 if you don't assume cinemark is over valued. Amc has more theaters, with a newer age due to renovation, and has less debt due in 2022/2023. AMC had higher sales, higher margins, and have improved margins since then.

AMC is currently selling at about a 30% discount to cinemark. 

Now, if you think both are overvalued, that's a different story."
2021-04-08 23:01:02,wallstreetbets,Seems like a solid plan. I might just end up setting a stop loss as it’s profit made any way.
2021-04-09 19:00:41,wallstreetbets,They've also diluted the living hell out of their company which I forgot to add
2021-04-08 20:53:01,wallstreetbets,Exactly I liked the stock at first but they’ve diluted their shares to stay in business and eliminated the short squeeze potential which is the whole reason it looked sexy in the first place. I’m selling my shares and going in on OTM GUSH puts.
2021-04-09 11:12:48,wallstreetbets,"personally, it was when management diluted PLUS gave themselves fat bonuses when i realized this is a sinking ship.  i made double digit percentages on the squeeze around the same time as GME's and thought about getting back in as it went below 7 again, but those moves were pretty disappointing"
2021-04-08 23:06:35,wallstreetbets,It would be nice from time to time.
2021-04-09 05:56:59,wallstreetbets,ape angry
2021-04-08 20:19:25,wallstreetbets,How many did u sell
2021-04-09 02:59:45,wallstreetbets,"Cinemas won't disappear but the viewership is declining as is shown in the numbers even before Covid. Profit per attendant was up but that's the only positive. Most of the growth is in developing countries.

For AMC to run into severe trouble, you don't need viewership to go to zero, just to decline significantly."
2021-04-09 02:02:41,wallstreetbets,Have you heard of netflix and chill
2021-04-09 08:58:37,wallstreetbets,Streaming has already taken over theaters. I mean theaters have been losing box office attendance every year for 20 years straight as people consume media more and more via internet. The pandemic forced a new swath of viewers to switch to streaming and they loved it.
2021-04-09 13:13:42,wallstreetbets,"An ipod touch may not have been able to.compete with Sony music Group when it comes to concerts, but it certainly did compared to cds.

Just like that, Disney can certainly compete with AMC's first move movie rights, especially when you add in the fact that 60"" tvs with home theatre surround sound is a pretty common thing to find nowadays. Now all that needs to happen is Disney releases their films on Disney+ at the same time as in theaters, and now those people with nice in home TVs can avoid sharing a headrest with a ton of other people. 

Going out to a restaurant and returning home to see a movie seems far more likely to capture a larger portion of the audience than ever before. Now, nothing beats the movie watching experience of a theater, so I don't see them going away soon, but AMC is in an unfortunate situation to have so much debt that I'm not sure they'll ever be able to catch up to it.

All of this has definitely eaten into AMC's market share, and I don't see that trend reversing. Certainly, a little bump will occur in 2021, but only compared to 2020. If you look at 2019, 2018, and further out, this will still be probably worse off than what the trend was before covid.

Edit: this is in no way looking at the global theater experience. What we don't know is how far that will progress, and that should be a huge factor moving forward. China hasn't completely divested from AMC, and this should help with some global reach (though I am less trusting of Chinese propaganda, I do believe worldwide interest in AMC's expansion could heavily rely on Chinese being distrusted less in certain parts of the world than Americans)."
2021-04-09 06:30:00,wallstreetbets,Such a well thought out and reasoned response to the above comment.
2021-04-09 11:49:43,wallstreetbets,Hahaha. That’s funny.
2021-04-08 21:15:00,wallstreetbets,Oh yes the charming experience of the two guys next to me that reek of reefer giggling during A Quiet Place. Who isn’t nostalgic for that??
2021-04-08 21:52:28,wallstreetbets,HAHA HAVE YOU EVEN CONSIDERED LOOKING AT THE FINANCIALS AND DISCLOSURES YOU DUMB FU*CK? IF YOU HAD YOU WOULD SEE THAT IN A NORMAL YEAR THEY ONLY GENERATE 1/3 WHAT THEY NEED IN CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. THEY ARE IN TROUBLE AND NEED TO CHANGE THEIR OPERATIONS AND / OR MODEL OR SUFFER THE INEVITABLE WHICH IS BANKRUPTCY IN A COUPLE YEARS OR LESS. THE SELLING OF EQUITY IS IMPERATIVE IF THEY HAVE ANY HOPE OF ELUDING BANKRUPTCY WITHIN THE NEXT TWO YEARS.
2021-04-09 11:10:57,wallstreetbets,"why not sell some itm calls, get a little premium, and be done with it?"
2021-04-09 13:00:18,wallstreetbets,"Yup. The bonuses clued me in that the folks at the helm were in it for the dough, not for the company."

AMC is/was purely a bunch of idiots who were late to the GME train, and deposited 100 bucks on Robinhood and were able to buy 25 of something because it was cheap, and had HiGh ShOrT iNtErEsT...for damn good reason.

For the people who got in and out, that was easy money, but not a chance this will become a moonshot."

2021-04-09 04:30:27,wallstreetbets,"Not specifically cruise ships, but I’m sure governments care more about the tourism that the industry brings rather than the entertainment & revenue movie theaters bring. My point was obviously more focused on the airplanes bit, though."

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Palantir Demo Day April 14th Calls? Hey, so if anyone remembers, PLTR Demo Day in January 26th turned out to be a huge success.  They showed some new features and focused on how they normally show off new feature releases for their customers.  They also gave us a little something with what I like to call the ""X-Com Global Defense Demo"".  It literally fking rocked.

The stock was hovering at $34.32-$36.87 through the day and closed at $35.37 kinda non-spectacularly.

However, what happened the next day was a huge surprise to everyone since the stock surged to the ATH $45 before closed at $39.

This new demo coming on April 14th (next Wednesday) is the first in a \*series\* of demos.  Sounds like some more in depth about how it works.  Hopefully it's not just a bunch of doods with crappy microphones reading off a boring ass script in their kitchen again.

[https://www.palantir.com/double-click/](https://www.palantir.com/double-click/)

Do you think we'll see another pop?  I'm semi doubtful since it seems a lot of sentiment has shifted over to GME, but it looks like the volume is super low.  $PLTR hasn't seen major trading volume for nearly a month.  I bought a bunch of shares at $9 back in early October and bought some more when it was in the teens.  I feel like dumping some to buy dorifto car for the summer, but if they're gonna pop next week, I might hold on to them a little longer."
2021-04-09 03:53:28,wallstreetbets,I would imagine that the better the demo day goes the more the stock will tank
2021-04-09 07:57:07,wallstreetbets,"Their product is hard as hell to demo in any way that doesn't just leave people coming away with a view of it just being some version of the ONE thing they demoed ( which to this point is mostly ""make a CRM that shows what you should upsell to a customer when they walk into your office!"" and ""watch your supply chain in real time!"" and ""conduct a war in real time, if you're the military!"".  


It's also much too soon not to have the (reasonable, but that doesn't seem to matter to the market) insider selling taint things a bit. And it's going to take a longer streak of growth to bring inline with valuation.  


THEN, I think people might finally start to give it some consideration. But even then, how much of the market is looking to invest in something that they have to sit on for five or ten years?!  


Also, wasn't that $45 pop the result of PLTR becoming a temporary meme-stock in this subreddit? I mean, Karp literally acknowledged reddit investors in the media as a result of it.... In fact, I sometimes wonder if WSB doing their meme-magic with PLTR hasn't  sort of tainted it for a bit."

2021-04-09 07:51:29,wallstreetbets,"But they need to do it in a way that isn't just ""You can make a CRM that let's you see what things you should try to upsell a customer on as soon as they walk into your bank!"", though. That shit is boring and doesn't differentiate the product. It lends itself toward making people compare it to Salesforce or SNOW, simply because they don't really get what it does with one or two demos here and there."

2021-04-08 21:23:45,wallstreetbets,"If futures hold, the 1d RSI tomorrow on SPY will pass 70. It hasn't done that since late August before Spy fell $34 in 3 days. 

The day before that crash the 9 day MA was $9 below and the 50d MA was $30 below. Right now, based on current futures, the 9 day MA is $8 below and the 50d MA is $21 below. The biggest separation since the Sept crash.

Our 30 day volume is 55 million, which is 4 million more than august before volume spiked to 149M before Spy dropped $14 in a single day. The comparison between later August and this month's volume and price action is nearly identical.

The reason why I'm comparing this specifically to the early Sept crash is because no news triggered that crash, indicators were just severally alarming and we had been in HEAVILY overbought territory for  7 days. Then a couple firms liquidated their heavily profited tech positions and caused the algos to trigger a crash. Tomorrow marks the first day of our heavily overbought territory."

2021-04-08 22:19:40,wallstreetbets,"I have a theory which supports a bull run tomorrow into next week.

If you look at SPY, the RSI value is at 342. The clean denominator is 657. Therefore, the indexing trend line (CD/RSI) is roughly 250. We know that the indexing trend line being lower than 80% value of the stock generally means that the decompression control indicator (DCI) takes a nose dive. When the DCI and indexing trend line cross negatively at an angle greater than 20 degrees, it's a massive bull indicator and generally when this happens, the entire market gaps 4%+ in a single day.

This is not financal advice."

PLTR is kind of a meme stock but their August calls are pretty cheap too demo day is in a couple weeks so there is a good chance of at least one spike in there.  Eyeing 8/20 40c they're .77 right now.

Inflation is unmanageable even by Powell and that’s a part of why stocks will only go up. Banks can’t continue to hold money, it’s has to go to equities. Even loans will be deflationary for banks currently."

2021-04-08 21:11:35,wallstreetbets,"Delta is measure of how much option changes based on underlying stock e.g. option had delta of .7, stock goes up $1 option goes up $.7. Gamma is derivative of delta, which means it shows how much delta changes based on change in the underlying. If gamma is .2 , the delta increases 20%. Having high gamma exposure (GEX) means you get more gains for change in underlying, but also lose much more if it goes down. It’s worrying as an over leveraged market rarely goes down easily, historically ends in a bang. How much more euphoria can we achieve? We’re beginning to enter a fools market, one way or another it’ll be interesting to watch play out.

but luckily snoo made me feel good today and i got to talk to her :) unfortunately tren is still MIA and i can no longer rest my sleepy head on his massive pecs or lick his abs. I miss tren. But snoo is a somewhat adequate replacement

It’s crazy to me how widely divergent and unevenly distributed cognitive ability is in a single species. What’s even more crazy is how people of a similar cognitive ability seem to cluster and find one another. I am not making a joke or trying to be funny, but it is striking to me how low and uninformed the discourse level is on any given GME post. They have built up their own parallel vocabulary—almost a mythology—to talk about what’s happening in the stock in a way that bears no relationship to reality. It’s genuinely fascinating when you step back and observe from a distance."

2021-04-09 00:00:03,wallstreetbets,"Listen up APEs.. there are massively more shorts than reported...

  


Brokers sent our order flow to Shitadel, who instead of filling the order in the market creates an accounting IOU and then the broker pretends you have shares in your account. This generated massive naked shorts. Now we can't let those naked shorts become failure to delivers by going past t+3 reg sho rule and certainly not past t+3+13 days or everyone would know we are trapped.. so we use dark pool to wash/juggle/trade with ourselves. Closing out one naked short while opening a new one at the same time.

  


now you know.. for Feb. Dark pool we have AMC (1.7b dark pool volume) and GME (300m dark pool volume). N.AKeD (2.225b dark pool volume) we all fighting the same war against the same Greedy Giant name Shitadel who owes us lots of cookies!

  


Not selling, don't be a chimpout be a diamond handed APE! 💎

  


I analyzed dark pool trades for NAKeD in Feb. And I found 175.6m rolling naked shorts being washed every 3 days by Shitadel this is similar to what I saw happening in GME and AMC. 175m + 35m +7m FTDs = 212m shares short a company with zero debt and 270m cash, dear God!

2021-04-08 21:11:57,wallstreetbets,"Delta is measure of how much option changes based on underlying stock e.g. option had delta of .7, stock goes up $1 option goes up $.7. Gamma is derivative of delta, which means it shows how much delta changes based on change in the underlying. If gamma is .2 , the delta increases 20%. Having high gamma exposure (GEX) means you get more gains for change in underlying, but also lose much more if it goes down. It’s worrying as an over leveraged market rarely goes down easily, historically ends in a bang. How much more euphoria can we achieve? We’re beginning to enter a fools market, one way or another it’ll be interesting to watch play out."

Once a company reports the IV tends to fall and with options the IV is king that’s the only thing that matters.  If it falls even if the price goes up you will lose money

DFV’s options expire 4/16. I’ve seen a push from some new legislation recently, conveniently close to his dates he’s been transparent with. Something big is around the corner. Nobody needs to do anything but hold their shares and buy more if they can. No new laws until this is over. Any legislation now of all times needs to remain suspect."

2021-04-08 20:54:52,wallstreetbets,"Well....started 'investing' back when the first /u/ironyman meme came out, about his box spreads and breaking robinhood. I put 80 bucks in to buy 3 shares of AMD before their earnings, because I knew their 7nm cards would be hot. I made 20 dollars.

Thought..wow, if only I'd used options instead! Then I got really lucky one FED interest rate day, popped from 2k to 6k...then held overnight due to PDT worries, lost half in my sleep. Let the rest of my FD's bleed out and went essentially back down to my original investment +1k or something.

This brought on the 'tilt' trading. I was throwing 1k at VXX FD's and not selling at the right time, then some tard on here was saying ""mortgage your house and buy this Boeing dip"". I was all in boeing for a bit, that killed me. I kept throwing money in and occasionally turning a brief profit only to throw it back on the fire.

(and I also have losses on etrade and TDA, my only success has been my passively invested Roth where I hold gold miner penny stocks and sell covered calls, up 55%...)

edit: I forgot...most of this loss is from me trying to short AMD from 30 bucks until they hit 60-70. Then I gave up on them forever."

2021-04-08 20:57:15,wallstreetbets,"No clue haha. If I had to guess, it would be the low volume and VIX making it pretty reasonable to hold onto at least a handful of shares of your favorite blue chips. Not that I haven't been losing hella money having most of it in smaller caps instead.

The dark index and gex are ideally a trailing indicator. DIX predicted spy hitting about 412 in about 40-50 days from now (bout 10-20 days ago DIX hit 45% - when this happens the average return of SPX is 5% over the next two months as opposed to the average 1-2% return). If you're me, your hoping those blue chips go back on discount so you can wave bye bye to the other crap and then sell again at 410. Means we could easily see a lil back and forth in the meantime"

2021-04-09 19:28:42,wallstreetbets,What Squeeze? Its virtually non-existent !!!Would you like me to get you the video?
2021-04-09 19:43:44,wallstreetbets,"Fact!

&#x200B;

Shares Outstanding  70,031,650 

 Shares Short   10,187,320    

&#x200B;

So if you want to find out how short that is...... You take  10,187,320 and divide it by 70,031,650 and that = 0.145 or 14.5% of the total shares. That is not what most of you are thinking it is!!!! So the squeeze is pretty much Non-existent..... You can find this out by getting any stock quote off any trading platform and doing the math...... 

&#x200B;

Or you can read this article and it will tell you the same thing I just told you

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Fubo Tv-DD: A potential Short Squeeze, but also a low risk/high reward investment.  

Alright, listen up y’all. I’ve been working on some FUBO DD, and I will be presenting you a bull case, but not without presenting some counter arguments.

Pros: 

1. **Sports Betting**: As many of you may know, FUBO plans to add integrated sports gambling tied into their streams as an option. The sports gambling market is expected to roughly quadruple in the next 4 years overall. FUBO only needs to get a small slice of that pie. 
2. **Value compared it to its competitors**: FUBO has a market cap of about 2.9B. ROKU=48B. DFKN=24.5B. I think we all understand Roku and Draft Kings are much better at what they do then fubo, but 10x-20x more valuation? That’s a stretch. Simply based of FUBOs revenue and market cap, this stock should be tripled. 
3. **Aggressiveness as a company**; With the acquisition of Vigtory, and a recent closing of a deal with Marquee Network I like how they are not satisfied as a company and they are swinging for the fences. 
4. **Options spreads**: i don’t know if its big brained gamblers or insiders who know whats coming, but the recent Volume on Calls compared to Puts is ridiculous. A put/call ratio from 0.07-0.19 for the rest of April, and an implied volatility of 130%.
5. **Future Growth, Cord cutting**: Cord cutting has only just started. More and more will move to streaming platforms, and FUBO has been winning more than its fair share of those customers. Their expected revenue for 2021 is 460M which is incredible based on their market cap. They have 550k subscribers,73% growth year over year. Also their advertising deals are growing too, 53% growth year over year. receiving $20 per user for ads. 
6. **Institutional Holders:** Tutes own roughly 40% of the shares, Disney being one of the big share owners.
7. **Natural Cycle of a Growth Stock:** If anyone thinks this is a POS stock because it's gone down a bunch for no reason? Guess what, pretty much any young company has that experience before the rockets take off. Look at ROKU for example. From Nov19-March 20, it lost more than 50% of its value over that time period.Then it jumped up 600%
8. **Short Squeeze**: FUBO has some serious potential for a short squeeze, the short float is at 35%, and it's already been beaten down enough. We’ve seen plenty of examples of the shorts picking on a “cult” stock that is already down plenty from recent high, with relatively low float.

Reasons for the stock collapse:

It has been a perfect storm for Fubo bears. The stock has been  in a free fall since February.

1. A pullback from its parabolic rise in 3 months was inevitable.
2. The Q4 2020, ER report confirmed the company's growth. But because they are not making money, which of course they're not, there was a selloff nonetheless.
3. Money was shifted out of growth stocks to more profitable stocks recently.
4. There are some fugaze lawsuits coming FUBOs way, but any stock that has fallen this much is under lawsuit, this is nothing to worry about.
5. Arcehgo’s hedge Fund defaulted $30 billion, much of that was in media companies (most notably DISCA, VIAC, and to a lesser extent FUBO). 
6. FUBO’s IPO investor Lock-Up ended April 6th, and the sell off on the 7th.
7. The shorties, its always the fucking shorts

Cons:

1. Technical Analysis, which is wizardry to a mere mortal like me suggests that worst case scenario, FUBO goes down to $15. But I can’t imagine we will get there, I think it holds up at support. It has bounced off the 200ma 4 times in the last couple weeks.
2. I can only assume they are bleeding cash, and may need to have an offering soon
3. Their business model , vMVPD, seems like a very boomerish way of “cord cutting”. Because you’re still paying for a bunch of shit you may not want. 
4. Will the gambling aspect work? People like DFKG and fan duel just fine. 
5. There are probably some serious bag holders in the $30-40 range, and we could see some resistance from them as they look to sell when they break even. 

TLDR:

I think this is an amazing swing play for a squeeze, a good long term investment if the squeeze doesn’t come. FUBO is 1 PR away from triggering a beautiful run up, then the FOMO sets in, and boom, they are back at $30 before you know it. And if you degenerates start chipping in, we’re at $50+ in a heartbeat.There are some obvious negatives about the company & the stock, but if there wasn’t , this puppy would be at $150 by now. This is a low-risk, high reward play that we are lucky to even have the opportunity to be a part of. 

PTs :$30 by May without a short squeeze

$50 by April-June if there is a squeeze

$60-80 EOY."
2021-04-08 20:57:43,wallstreetbets,Fubo's chart looks hilariously manipulated. I mean it would be hilarious if my ave wasn't 37.
2021-04-08 20:05:09,wallstreetbets,"God damn I wish I saw this when the casino was still open.

Edit: bought 2 5/30 30c on the ""dip"" thanks OP this is lookin like it'll be my first non-shit options play and I learned how to option 2 weeks ago."
2021-04-08 21:20:17,wallstreetbets,been holding 2500 shares around $35 bring me back boys
2021-04-08 20:13:32,wallstreetbets,Is buying tomorrow first morning dip retarded? Am I FOMO ing?
2021-04-08 20:25:56,wallstreetbets,World Cup streaming rights...this shit is going to moon tomorrow
2021-04-08 21:00:52,wallstreetbets,"2000 shares at 21.70. Man, I really thought it was going under 20 today. thank god for the soccer news. tomorrow is OPEX so I don't expect much but monday should be interesting."
2021-04-09 01:26:40,wallstreetbets,"Will this help me with my 6,700 shares @ $41? [I’m down over $130k.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mduqiy/fubo_yololosses_on_margin_update_we_cannot_let/)"
2021-04-09 00:40:33,wallstreetbets,I like FUBO but I don't really like the way sports betting is being hyped.  It reminds me of how weed stock was hyped.
2021-04-09 01:51:53,wallstreetbets,Fubotv 100 eoy book it
2021-04-09 10:46:22,wallstreetbets,Push fubo up

2021-04-09 06:54:57,wallstreetbets,You could be me at 46.67 🤡
2021-04-09 10:16:51,wallstreetbets,"I cashed out big on Fubo in January when it had that first run up. I just got in some August calls this morning. It's heavily shorted, the lockup period ended several days ago and is super cheap right now. This could actually get squeezed for real, it's one of the most shorted stocks on the market."
2021-04-08 22:50:29,wallstreetbets,"You didn’t even mention that it’s a potential takeover target. With their sports niche, being the only one streaming live in 4K HD, a larger streamer may want to snap them up while they’re still under $10B market cap.  Would be much cheaper than trying to build out ones own infrastructure."
2021-04-09 01:40:18,wallstreetbets,"I hope soon I am back I am down 50% so far the worst stock I had been holding 
Hope they become the Netflix of sports"
2021-04-09 10:49:37,wallstreetbets,I’m sitting on 750 shares and am a true investor for this company.
2021-04-09 11:03:36,wallstreetbets,"Thanks a ton , dude. You gave me a 4x bagger with this"
2021-04-09 11:23:57,wallstreetbets,The volume is nuts right now
2021-04-08 22:37:59,wallstreetbets,You want us to buy when IV is high?
2021-04-09 00:37:04,wallstreetbets," The way I see it you can either have FUBO or FOMO.   


I hate sports but love this company. Cord cutting is real and I listened to a podcast with Ted Sorantos. I share the belief that cable companies themselves will cord cut in favor of streaming services they own like Disney plus/ Paramount, etc."
2021-04-09 05:43:50,wallstreetbets,currently bagholding 48 shares @ $41.46 FML
2021-04-09 17:39:02,wallstreetbets,You all already know that sport betting will be coming q3 for free then go live in q4!So why not just buy cheap down here and hold your shares 😉all the way to q4!This will be the easiest money you can make guaranteed!
2021-04-08 22:07:04,wallstreetbets,I bought 110 shares and sold a CC yesterday. Hopefully I have time to close or roll over because it might go tits up to $30 a share.
2021-04-09 02:05:13,wallstreetbets,"OP, you forgot to mention that loss making companies are super hot right now. 

Net losses are what investors crave!"
2021-04-09 10:47:08,wallstreetbets,"Is it still going up with this soccer announcement. I want to average down and hold.  SEEMS SAFE ENOUGH. 🤷‍♂️
Any info on when the FUBO TV betting platform be launched?"
2021-04-09 11:33:35,wallstreetbets,Qatar is the sponsor.
2021-04-09 12:20:53,wallstreetbets,"I bought in when this ""dipped"" below $45. I was super confident it would rip to $60. You SOB, I still am! Only 1 tute has sold and they all bought shares in the low $40's."
2021-04-08 22:14:28,wallstreetbets,Why not OTRK? It hAs OvEr 43% ShOrT fLoAt
2021-04-09 11:08:44,wallstreetbets,22% gain off of a South American soccer tournament. Something else is happening.
2021-04-08 21:47:31,wallstreetbets,I’m down 75% on the 1/21/22 35c. Thinking about averaging down now
2021-04-08 21:44:35,wallstreetbets,I’m averaged in at $36 per share.  These bags are getting heavy.
2021-04-08 21:07:33,wallstreetbets,"Give this one time. There's not gonna be any huge catalysts until they get their betting platform going. Until then it's at the whim of big money pushing it around. I figured it would dip pretty deep at some point until they hit some milestones, just not like immediately after buying in."
2021-04-08 20:52:22,wallstreetbets,"22 is still a great entry, dont see any reason this will go below 20 again"
2021-04-08 20:25:43,wallstreetbets,i wanna know
2021-04-09 00:57:43,wallstreetbets,Streaming rights to South America qualifying. Lol... yeah that’ll make it moon

2021-04-09 08:14:49,wallstreetbets,Slowly but surely ✋💎🤚
2021-04-09 06:39:59,wallstreetbets,I spend way more money on sports betting than weed. And I like both very much.
2021-04-08 23:17:36,wallstreetbets,IV is always high on FUBO just buy when IV is lower relative to its average IV
2021-04-08 21:06:32,wallstreetbets,I mean if you time the jump tomorrow morning you might pick up some puts that will go itm when it settles back down. But you'll need to sell before iv goes back down.
2021-04-09 15:15:21,wallstreetbets,Might be 2022
2021-04-09 15:14:43,wallstreetbets,Didn't a bunch of people die there building stadiums?
2021-04-09 11:11:55,wallstreetbets,"Yep, glad you agree because it's mooning"
2021-04-08 20:02:52,wallstreetbets,"Hope u make many tendies, bless up!"

2021-04-09 12:51:20,wallstreetbets,"Up 20% when I sold earlier, it was nice thanks!"
2021-04-08 20:11:16,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I haven't delved deep into FUBO, however my stance right now would be more bearish on it. Tmm I may buy some PLUG puts instead."
2021-04-08 21:04:33,wallstreetbets,How to lose your ass to iv in one easy step!
2021-04-09 13:06:42,wallstreetbets,"Yea wasn’t big enough gain for me, I’ll bag hold to see how this ends up in a month or 2"

2021-04-09 03:16:52,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I love Charles Payne!  Straight up tells it like it is.  I love the eye roll when he says ""AKA Diamond Hands"" when he refers to the hedge funds.  We're not running and hiding and playing video games.  We are buying and holding and taking control.  Wall Street hates what we are doing because they don't want us to succeed and they are afraid.  They have never dealt with retail investors like us!  Be afraid, hedgies!

Also, it is not just American exceptionalism that is back.  We are joined by our ape brothers and sisters from around the world, and we are united against the tyranny, corruption, and greed that has plagued Wall Street for so long."
2021-04-09 07:16:57,wallstreetbets,Retardalicious
2021-04-08 20:03:44,wallstreetbets,American exceptionalism is a fucking joke. We have the lowest percent of upwards mobility (moving from one income bracket aka social class to another) by far than any other first world country. There’s a reason our faith has been declining: because we have a much greater access to information and are starting to see through the propaganda. I hate the fake American dream bullshit

So here is my question, what is the evidence that GME stock will moon again? I mean that seriously, I have 22 shares of GME currently.  I am not a day trader if I buy stock I'm in it for the foreseeable future. Every day I see GME peak in after hours only to crash when the market opens? I honestly don't know if that is a common thing with stocks? Maybe I should cut my losses you guys tell me??"

2021-04-09 01:03:51,wallstreetbets," GME is the catalyst to symbolize the morality of wealth.
The beginning of humanity symbiotically reorganizing macro financial independence.Anything less and my 29 shares in can go to $0. This is about all the people in the world that pray they had a platform to not only tell the money changers woah to their quantative manipulation but make them feel the gravity of their compounding actions on a global scale right at their: porch,dinner table, & conversations with their children as their world turns on its head. 
This is about the best of the people helping cure the worst in us as a people. 
To live is to learn and to learn is to grow while growth is the measurement of this life we know."

Its utterly irrational and so god damn beautiful.

I believe America’s best years are ahead of it and its because beautiful bastards like you are going to run head first into the wall of the future and emerge into a technology driven golden age like harry fucking potter arriving at a train station!

And as the rest of the world goes “how the fuck did those weird cowboy people with all the student debt win again?” You’ll flash them a shit eating grin and say “‘Cause we’re America!”

American exceptionalism is realizing hedge funds were illegally manipulating the market and bankrupting them for it while staying within the law without needing a court room, a regulatory body, or a war to do it.

Washington crossed the frozen Delaware at night on Christmas to kill some Redcoats. Americans don’t fuck around, we don’t give a fuck about your rules, and we always get what we want. The problem people like you have is realizing that the people who invented the idea of bootstrapping are King George.

They may even advise you to park funds in accurately priced, 1.50% YTM  OTR USTs, and “safe” 401k income mutual funds.  Caveat emptor!  Watch those fund fees!

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Netflix strikes deal for Sony films Netflix remains the #1 streaming service in the US, and today just added all of Sony's back catalogue of movies to its own catalogue. This gives them the right to stream all new movies arriving between theatrical release and DVD/BlueRay, including films such as “Morbius,” “Uncharted” and “Bullet Train.” Netflix will also be able to place films such as “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” and future Venom and other Spider-Man films on its platform. The deal will be ongoing for the foreseeable future.

NFLX is up 60 points in a month and shy 30 points from its ATH, which I expect it to break prior to its next quarterly earnings report in July.

NFLX $540c 7/16"

With Amazon getting NFL rights, Disney growing their service, Paramount entering the picture, Netflix glory days are over.  Pedophiles will still subscribe, but that's it, they are a certainly a leader for the sicko crowd.  I would buy a 2023 150p on them, look at the movies you chose to highlight, hot garbage, and movies aren't bingable, they don't keep you coming back.  Losing the office sealed the deal.

With the amount of recreational gear and toys that have been purchased during covid, I think banking on the entertainment industry in the near term is foolish.

Not just poors.

It's easier to just buy xyz dollar amount vs shares."
2021-04-08 23:02:06,wallstreetbets,"of course brokerages encourage it, you have to be on a margin account to purchase in dollars/fractionals, and when you're on a margin account buying ""shares"" in dollars you don't actually own squat. the broker gets to use all of your thousands of dollars any way they want, loan it out any way they want, the shares don't even necessarily have to exist you're just trading the value anyways. converting to cash account and purchasing shares(which is insanely easy you hit the number of how many you want and it tells you how much it costs lol) and setting an order is as good as it gets to not only owning your share and forcing your broker into a situation where they would have to deliver, but also preventing your broker from fucking you in the ass with your own money."
2021-04-08 23:20:32,wallstreetbets,"This explanation is important for people on a platform like robinhood, or something.(which you shouldn't be on since they froze trading in the thing you care about). 

Not as relevant for people who use ibkr, fidelity,.etc. You have to enroll in lending your shares out.

Also, while the current situation of forcing a squeeze is interesting, there are tons of situations where using a margin account can be useful for more advanced/people with higher risk tolerances.

Personally, I use the leverage actively.

Some people may at times hold zero cash and utilize a margin account at a brokerage to just borrow against a large asset base. The ""cash management"" feature of the broker, the whole point is to allow flexibility. There's a books worth of reasons/explanations on why a margin account is very very useful."

>Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Thursday he wouldn’t have a knee-jerk panic attack if inflation heats up to a 4% annual rate.

>It would be important to ascertain whether the high inflation was due to something temporary – like a blockage in the Suez Canal – or something more that was more long-lasting, he said.

Powell been telling us that inflation is temporary and is not a problem.

2021-04-08 23:35:04,wallstreetbets,"The amount of people demanding oil and gas to support their driving and traveling went down drastically, while the supply skyrocketed. This drives prices down.

The price of oil literally went negative briefly because there was nowhere on earth left to store it

And none of Biden's executive orders impacted ongoing energy production, just projects that were being constructed."
2021-04-08 23:44:52,wallstreetbets,"It was at an all time low because timed almost perfectly with the first world wide lockdowns, OPEC and Russia were in an oil cold war where they drastically drove down the price to try and control the market."
2021-04-09 11:45:53,wallstreetbets,"None of his executive orders impacted ongoing energy production - they halted projects that were under development and had not yet contributed anything to US energy production. 

It probably has more to do with the usage of cars, ships, and planes vastly decreasing during the pandemic while Russia and OPEC massively up scaled their production to fight over market share. 

You’re aware there was a period of time when oil prices went negative because nobody on earth had a good place to store all the excess oil that was being generated and not consumed, right?"
2021-04-09 09:27:46,wallstreetbets,I'm talking from the COVID dip when it hit 1400 to it's peak at 2100. I don't think that normal consolidation is 'banks manipulating' it downward.

It's essentially what I call collecting chump change until you get steamed over. Sure selling CSP sounds like a great idea in a bull market (buying shares is even better) until it stops being a bull market.
2021-04-08 23:23:34,wallstreetbets,I had friends who used to do that—until the hens got too old to lay and they discovered that they couldn’t “do the deed”. Their hens ended up dying of old age. Don’t go into the egg business unless you can either kill the old hens yourself or let someone else do it.

Finally, earning a living, which for some reason you attacked, isn’t really something that conservatives see as the most important. It’s building a free society with a solid foundation of shared values. Earning a living is just baked in to the building of a society. It has literally nothing to do with corporations. Most hate large corpos anyways since they buy in to the NWO bullshit. Besides, why the hell do you think I’m in WSB, you twat?"

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$KHC bull thesis So I'm sure everyone has seen the news on national ketchup shortage.  In the past when news like this broke like the toilet paper situation. The toilet paper stocks rocketed.   Sanitizer shortages, same thing.  

KHC was green today, but really not that great and low on volume.  Any ideas on why the small price action?
Just sensory overload, and it was overlooked?   


This stock is top 5 in Buffet's and Burry's portfolio. The company has made all the right moves in terms of paying down debt and making the momentum go the right direction as of late.

I'm thinking that being that we are sitting at a 52 week high there is a mental resistance line to cross. However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off.

Some interesting catalyst I noticed there has been over $65 million in block purchases made.  I'm not an expert on these but I couldn't see any other block purchases anywhere near this size on khc in recent past.  (If I'm wrong on this, please show me where to find it.)

 Assuming that Burry has exercised his call options or will rather than selling, Buffets giant position, the block purchases today, the consistent upwards momentum, the increase in demand and profitability on the ketchup packets.      Things look really really good on this company.  


When first researching this stock I really didn't fully understand all of the fundamentals that have been falling in place over the last year to get us to this point.   I looked at this stock as a great hedge if and when the market crashes as consumers rotate back into home cooked meals and groceries with less eating out to save money.


I see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me.   If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up.   If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up.   Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up.    

Extremely Bullish on this company.

I am certainly no expert but I love this brand right now.  
If anyone wants to add to my thoughts or even poke holes in my statements I encourage it.   Id like to know what everyone else thinks about this company.  


Edit update:
Open options interest for this week are trending 100% bullish sentiment

Today they announced a new marshmallow snack for grab and go has station type purchases.    Marshmallow is one of the highest profit margins of any food products.

Article 
[Heinz](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com/amphtml/entertainment/ketchup-shortage-affecting-restaurants-across-195912767.html)


Position update request: I have 600 call option contracts ranging between $40-$41 most of them expiring tomorrow and 16th and 23rd.   Less than 100 expire further out.      I have $45 strike prices as far out as October.    Additionally 300 shares

This is not a short squeeze play as some have asked.

However with the insanely high option call interest ITM or close there could be some significant GAMMA movement I would speculate.

I have been following shortable shares and the availability of them.     As the price has approached $41 there is usually a huge drop in available shares to short right after a steep drop.   This would indicate short ladder attacks by market makers to keep it under $41.   

Speculation and patterns suggest to me that breaking the $41 mark with momentum would generate enough of a mini short squeeze as well as Gamma to push it immediately to $42-$43 which is then breaking the 52 week high.  After that.  We should see it price closer to proper valuation and by the time earnings come out I think we will be genuinely surprised by what all they have been working on and making progress on their bottom line."

Why do you think they haven't tried again since then? You see boomers talking about how much they miss the physical keyboard but they always forget that you do so much more than send emails on a phone now. Blackberry never gets that right, so the phones flop because they are mediocre smart phones with a physical keyboard that reduces the screen size by 30%. 

Also what security features does blackberry have that makes it unique? All the major phone manufacturers have enterprise security suites (for instance Knox with Samsung) and that's really the only area where security like that would seriously influence the buying decision."

I hope they are made to the same standards by Foxconn as iphones.

What would be horrible is if they have shitty build quality & security issues. Afaik BB10 runs qnx and Android in a container.

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Plug Power: Sell the Dip **tl;dr: PLUG has a history of burning shareholders and customers, does not make an economical product, and the shares are worth much closer to $0 than to $30. If you're thinking of buying shares or calls, don't. If you hold shares or calls, sell them. If you want to make a bet, buy puts.**

It's July 2000. You've made a decent amount of tendies over the past few years investing in hot tech companies. The markets are down a fair bit from their March highs, but that just means there are more buying opportunities. Maybe you can find the next Microsoft.

You find a stock that looks promising -- Plug Power. It's down 50% from its 52-week high, but you're sure it's gonna be huge. Green energy is the future. It's got the largest company in the world, General Electric, as an investor. [Bob Nardelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nardelli), the head of GE Power Systems and a contender to succeed Jack Welch, is on the board of directors. And their joint venture with GE just announced a deal to sell 1500 fuel cells to a Saudi Arabian trading company controlled by the royal family. If even the oil kingdom is moving to the hydrogen economy, you want to be a part of it. You're buying.

Over the next few years, you will lose more than 95% of your investment.

What happened? Well, there is public documentation on some of this: the Saudi trading company sued Plug and the GE subsidiary that co-owned the joint venture in 2008 for breach of contract and misrepresentation. You can find a summary of the complaint [here](https://casetext.com/case/soroof-trading-development-company-ltd-plaintiff-v-ge-microgen-inc-and-plug-power-inc-defendants), but I'm working from a copy of their First Amended Complaint.

The complaint alleges that GE and Plug ""understood by February 1999 that [Plug's fuel cells] would never be marketable"" but formed the joint venture (GE Fuel Cell Systems, which I'll call either GEFCS or just ""the JV"" for short) anyway to try and recoup costs. Soroof (the name of the Saudi trading company, but I'll call them ""the guys who financed 9/11"" for long) further alleges that GEFCS was just an empty shell with ""nominal assets consisting of a small amount of furniture, a telephone switch and a computer server"" and an office subleased from Plug. And GEFCS duly extracted $1 million from the guys who financed 9/11 in exchange for exclusive rights to distribute the fuel cells in Saudi Arabia.

Somewhat incredibly, the complaint alleges that Plug and GE then proceeded to jerk around the guys who financed 9/11 for *five years*, telling Soroof over and over again that they were improving the product and it wasn't quite ready yet but it would be soon. Finally, ""In 2005, Soroof expressed its dissatisfaction with [GE and Plug's] complete lack of performance to date"", which you might recognize as the same thing your wife did right before she introduced you to Chad. The JV had effectively been dead for years (or so Soroof claims), but GE and Plug knew to expect a lawsuit, and hurriedly wound up the operation, with PLUG indemnifying GE against the first $1 million in claims arising from GEFCS. Plug [filed an 8-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000119312506063079/d8k.htm) notifying the markets of the termination of the JV, but they didn't tell the Saudis. And when the Saudis found out in early 2007, they completely lost their shit, and they sure did sue. (As best as I can tell the lawsuit ended up dissolving in a flurry of procedural arguments. I'm not a lawyer and I don't care.)

So if this complaint was filed by the guys who financed 9/11, why should you believe them? Well, there are other signs that the higher-ups at GE knew pretty quickly that Plug's fuel cells weren't going to be commercially viable. GE had agreed to buy fuel cells from Plug in early 1999 -- but they [couldn't meet specifications](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB957739751789506989) and cancelled the entire contract in spring 2000. Bob Nardelli was [off the board by mid-July 2000](https://eepower.com/news/john-g-rice-assumes-position-on-plug-powers-board-of-directors/), and it's telling that neither his [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobnardelli/) nor [his successor's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-rice-30b651118/?originalSubdomain=hk) nor the [president of the JV](https://biography.omicsonline.org/france/technip/barry-glickman-36852) makes reference to their involvement with Plug or GEFCS. And this also sounds like the MO of General Electric circa 2000, which was, in hindsight, [a bag of shit trading at 50 times earnings](https://philo.substack.com/p/success-theater) propped up by expansion into questionable businesses like long-term care insurance and a whole bunch of accounting gimmicks. That stock is also down more than 80% from its October 2000 high, although at least you got paid a dividend for your trouble.

But the biggest reason GE should have known early that Plug's fuel cells wouldn't be marketable is basic physics. To get green hydrogen, you need to consume electricity to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen (losing some along the way). Then you need to consume more energy to compress and transport the hydrogen. Then you turn it back into water, electricity and waste heat in a fuel cell. It's much cheaper and more efficient to transmit the energy directly over high-voltage power lines! For some applications -- like the forklifts that Plug promotes today -- there is a last-mile problem to solve, but as I'm sure you've heard, battery technology today is very good, and it's just more economical to use battery power. (I'll have more to say about both the physics and the forklifts in follow-on posts.)

Through the fiscal years 2001-6, Plug Power produced a cumulative loss of $16 million on $67 million of revenue *before any operating expenses*. Their net loss was much worse. By early 2007, the stock was trading at about where it is today on a split-adjusted basis, and if you bought in July 2000 you were down 95%. It got cut by another 90% before it rallied last year. And today looks a lot like July of 2000: Plug is [partnering with big oil companies](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fossil-fuel-mainstay-baker-hughes-joins-plug-power-in-green-hydrogen-fund-11617629145) and [taking sovereign investment money](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921001786/tm211407d2_8k.htm). More worryingly, it's delinquent filing its 10-K for 2020 and is [restating its accounts](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-to-restate-financial-statements-stock-plunges-11615930211) for the last two years, and it posted a [negative gross profit in Q3 2020](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837020013381/plug-20200930x10q.htm). Learn from the mistakes of the past. Sell the dip in PLUG.

2021-04-08 20:51:36,wallstreetbets,"I’m in this industry and it’s why I stay away from Plug. Lead-acid batteries are the most cost effective solution to mid-large range distribution centers, with lithium excelling at 24/7 operations (due to recharge times, and a mostly “maintenance-free” product”).

Hydrogen on the other hand requires massive infrastructure investment that just don’t see the returns that lead-acid or lithium could provide."
2021-04-09 03:57:41,wallstreetbets,"This stock coming back is a good example of history literally repeating itself.  Back in 1999 they were a lot of promising technologies but way too many BS companies, some just trading for no other reason than they seemed to be in the right space(tech) and not even any sales.   Today, same thing, all these EV startups.   Some literally with cars they videoed by pushing down a hill.  I bought this company in 1999 because they had all the slick marketing materials just like today!   My friend was a financial planner and they were pushing it.  Thank goodness I got out.   Let me tell you how all this ends- bad.  Think about it with all these stocks in companies where there is no profit, they will literally go away.  Be careful.  Tasty tendies sound good but...   on the other hand companies just overvalued back then did ok but took a long time, like MSFT.   And you dont know when the bubble will pop.  It popped then before 9/11 but that really killed anything left.  Who knows what the catalyst will be today but I saw this movie before a long time ago."
2021-04-09 10:10:39,wallstreetbets,"the best reason to sell plug is that the tech doesn't work.   ok ok, the fuel cell does 'work' but its expensive, doesn't have longevity and the cost of a hydrogen infrastructure is huge.

Might as well go electric.   There are some niche markets, like maybe marine could be interesting.  But you can just as easily get a ship to run on natural gas it would seem.

Zero Hedge is run by Daniel Ivandjiiski who writes under the pseudonym ‘Tyler Durden’, and is barred from trading by FINRA. According to sources, there’s a backdrop that with the recent price increase and increased interest in the ticker, Market Makers currently hold inadequate shares to cover assignment at April expiry and the heavy short position is well underwater. This is in addition to raised price targets and an earnings beat. The table is set for heavy buying into a very limited supply in the next eight days.

The idea that shorting a stock is betting the company will fail to meet or exceed investors expectations is 100% how shorting works, in a very general aspect. There can be 100’s of reasons why someone shorts a stock. Sure it could just be that the stock is overbought like you suggested. But i don’t think ASO was shorted simply because it was overbought (that would be a very irresponsible way of shorting), so you are more wrong than you think you are. They had a thesis, and their bet was ASO was another dying retailer that wasn’t effectively converting to e-commerce. But they totally misunderstood ASO offerings and their customers. I can elaborate on that for you but you’re going to have to pay me $350/ per share first hedgie."

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Quick DD on SunPower Corporation (SPWR)... highly shorted green energy company of interest I've done a bit of research on the [upcoming rebalance for Black Rock's green energy funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/thecorporation/comments/mm5cdo/blackrockageddon_2_further_thoughts_and_work_on/). As seen in the link, 60-odd energy stocks are being added to the fund, at the expense of the existing larger stakes (looking at you, PLUG). 

.

While NEE is the little darling of the change, SunPower Corporation is on the short list of recommended adds. This is interesting, because SPWR is also on the *other* short list... [the list of highly shorted companies](https://www.highshortinterest.com/). SPWR at the time of this writing is over 22% short floated (GME is 24%), and I show -11% short float from the previous month. I'm surprised it's still this high, because the impending rebalance would buy a lot of shares, raising the price. Price goes up, shorts have to exit, things get squeezy. 

.

This is where I like to hope that some intern at one of these hedge funds is reading this post and going to get his boss. If WSB is aware of the potential squeeze, as well as the potential BlackRock buy, there are $600 million in shorts that need to make their way to the door ASAP. I'm not going to say this is Gamestop... we're not at $5... but the current suppressed price is $29.9, and the 3 week high is $35. Just removing the short pressure could get that back, even without the BlackRock buying. I like to hope just the potential of BlackRock's buy will take it that high, but WSB taking note might have a strong incentive effect on hedge fund rectal clenching and take it higher.

.

Fundamentally, SPWR is a semiconductor company, P/E ratio is 8.4 (well below semiconductor industry average 25.2), and profits are in a bit of a slump, which should pick up with the green push by the US Government. My interest is in the good price, the heavy short load, and the potential to squeeze. If Blackrock announces the stock in its ETFs, I expect a very nice rise.

.

tl;dr: SPWR is highly shorted and may join Blackrock ETFs. Hedge funds fear the ape. This makes for delicious banana."

2021-04-09 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Top 7 Must Know Things Right Now (Stocks, Yields, The FED, $TSLA & More) **In today’s post I’m going to share with you what I believe to be the 7 most important things from the past couple of weeks that may impact the stock market, your portfolio & much more!**

**\[Disclaimer: Long Post\]**

Folks, we’ve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields & inflations scares from boohoo “suits” that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.

[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon & a couple of other stocks.

I believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE’s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE’s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon & others.

Small-caps & value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE’s as well due to the recent “booming economy” helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.

Just take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) & you can see that small & mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid & small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% & 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow & SP500.

Guys, let’s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:

**1.** **Inflation & Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**

My short answer is **NO**. I don’t think the massive stimulus packages & other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe & the US.

Though you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package & proposed infrastructure bill.

Most of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED & mostly everyone is already expecting this. 

On the other hand, if by any miracle, we don’t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks & especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.

[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn’t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy & given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.

It’s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.

**2. FED Rates.** 

So, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.

Right [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.

The [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.

The dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)… just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.

It’s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).

We can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.

This will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.

**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**

We have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week. 

Nonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%. 

It’s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.

The 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.

[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.

It’s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure & hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.

**4. Suez Canal blockage** 

[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it’s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.

**5.** **EVs**

In the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.

[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.

Though I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper & cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 & model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla & their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.

EVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it’s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.

**6.** **Economic Readings**

The consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven’t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices & inflation possibilities.

The [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it’s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.

**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**

Like in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn’t fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say “I’m very pleased with my investment”. That’s exactly what we see during the optimism & euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can’t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation & discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.

Well I think we’ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech & small-cap stocks, with CNN’s Fear & Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.

That’s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.

These were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless & unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.

Expect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.

2021-04-09 02:33:25,wallstreetbets,What is your avg?
2021-04-09 02:16:52,wallstreetbets,This is the way. The only way out is to go all in.

2021-04-09 02:15:23,wallstreetbets,Ive got 39K worth of calls. But Im looking to buy more tommorow and not take profits. Money its just a video game. Its not real.
2021-04-09 02:14:07,wallstreetbets,:( come to the 800 side
2021-04-09 01:23:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I, too like to blow $10K for some fake internet points"
2021-04-09 02:37:17,wallstreetbets,I'm sorry.  I do that a lot.
2021-04-09 02:36:17,wallstreetbets,If you click my username and look at my posts from today. 39K to 500K in 3 days challenge. You'll see but no average as I put everything in pltr calls. But Im positive overall. I was up about 6K today. And Im gonna buy more tommorow. And sell my 4/9s. At around $25 which I believe we will hit tommorow at least.
2021-04-09 10:49:34,wallstreetbets,"I use a slightly different analogy. If you have a nice chunk of money you can stay home and play video games. If you don’t have money you have to have a job. 

Go nuts and own the stock. Or long dated calls (worked for DFV!). Or spreads. Something that can end in less than a 100% loss."
2021-04-09 02:38:38,wallstreetbets,This gives me hope!
2021-04-09 02:26:37,wallstreetbets,Actually youre super right. My Hamonic Patterns says first target 32ish. Second Target 45. I think we hit 36 at a high.
2021-04-09 03:12:38,wallstreetbets,Beck from Mellow Gold.  This is the way.
2021-04-09 02:40:01,wallstreetbets,Have you seen the bull penant charts. Ive been charting it for over a month now. Its ready to hit. Either tommorow or monday.
2021-04-09 02:41:33,wallstreetbets,Plus low volume and tight consolidation. 30 cent moves. 15 cent moves etc. Sellers have dried up. Weve double bottomed at 22.76 in the last 2 days.
2021-04-09 02:32:28,wallstreetbets,Or he can make 200K. Risk reward is pretty good here.

2021-04-09 14:33:42,wallstreetbets,"I sold, fml."
2021-04-09 14:41:34,wallstreetbets,You were up right? You probably did ok
2021-04-09 14:42:02,wallstreetbets,A bit
2021-04-09 14:44:44,wallstreetbets,Be happy. If anything else had happened today other than rocket up 2% you'd be fucked lol. Read into tips on buying options. Buy closer to ATM strikes and follow the strikes with higher volume. Pltr seems to be stuck in band between 27 and 21. So if you see it hit 21 consider buying like 23c a month out.
2021-04-08 22:12:37,wallstreetbets,I'm curious how long you're going to ride it. Hell yeah in any case!
2021-04-09 08:21:38,wallstreetbets,That's why your name is pimpjuiceee
2021-04-08 22:48:59,wallstreetbets,"I'm thinking till at least SPY 420, might sell some at that point and just ride the rest out."

2021-04-09 12:02:07,wallstreetbets,Why are you using robinhood?
2021-04-09 00:05:03,wallstreetbets,"Imo that's actually smart, Tesla is way overpriced ( P/E is 1000), it's a new and innovative company but still it's a bubble waiting to burst."

2021-04-08 21:39:03,wallstreetbets,Ok step 2 now leave robinhood!
2021-04-09 00:54:31,wallstreetbets,smart move. tesla will be sideways for months
2021-04-09 01:10:02,wallstreetbets,You are a god among men
2021-04-09 01:17:35,wallstreetbets,Elon would be proud!
2021-04-09 09:45:34,wallstreetbets,Did the same with 21 shares of Tesla. Good ape.

2021-04-09 06:06:22,wallstreetbets,"Because DD has been predicting the imminent squeeze since the Jan event, so people are worried about missing out during the transfer process.
Some of us are also continuously buying dips, which further delays the transfer process."
2021-04-08 21:55:25,wallstreetbets,It’s lazy and short sighted sticking with RH.
2021-04-09 01:15:00,wallstreetbets,"I’m just a dumb ape, so let me know where I got this wrong.

I was in GME with Robinhood when it all went down and didn’t their clearing house run out of money? It wasn’t just them, a lot of the other players like Webull that used clearing houses ran out of money to back trades. 

Places like SoFi and Fidelity that have large bank rolls and don’t use clearing houses didn’t have the same problems.  

So I’d get wanting to move to Fidelity to keep it from happening again which I realize is entirely possible in Robinhood. But where does the corruption come in? 

I think Vlad’s a greasy character that doesn’t explain himself well, and I think he hurt himself by not speaking more plainly about the situation, but I don’t buy the idea that because Capital has a stake in the company, Vlad was doing their bidding or some such conspiratorial nonsense. We’ve had SEC investigations and congressional hearings and there’s no proof of that."
2021-04-09 10:48:38,wallstreetbets,Let me guess....it's not ready yet and Elon will make more grand promises he can't deliver on.
2021-04-09 04:05:03,wallstreetbets,"Reading through these comments, seems like popular opinion now"
2021-04-09 00:24:56,wallstreetbets,"I think you just contradicted yourself, respectfully. I could be just too stupid to understand though."
2021-04-09 16:04:03,wallstreetbets,Not a smooth brain
2021-04-08 23:22:47,wallstreetbets,This is NOT the way!!!
2021-04-08 20:43:58,wallstreetbets,No no no an outdated company that sells video games. Huge difference
2021-04-09 14:25:56,wallstreetbets,"Steal from the poor and give to the rich, Robbing Hood.

Why're people buying on it?"
2021-04-08 20:39:08,wallstreetbets,Yep pulled all my money from robinhood this week
2021-04-08 21:24:47,wallstreetbets,Server crash due to surge of increases in selling. I can already see it coming.
2021-04-08 21:52:26,wallstreetbets,Last time it was plummeting to 120 I managed to sell my RH shares at 160 and buy on fidelity at 124 an hour later. i already had cash in fidelity and was just waiting to use it. That’s how I got out of RH. I also had a share at E*TRADE so I did a transfer for that one. I use Robinhood for the chart and that’s even more business than I should be giving them. Guarantee they sell even just standard social media type data to the highest bidder alongside the pfof.

2021-04-09 01:48:07,wallstreetbets,Your comment brought me back to earth and gave me more confidence. RH even credited me for when I got caught up in the halt and lost money.
2021-04-08 21:21:03,wallstreetbets,"Good idea, they may be down off there insane highs but I'd never bet against them or sell my position if I had one"

2021-04-09 16:09:05,wallstreetbets,I mean hey since that post GME is still wayy worse off then TSLA so far 👍
2021-04-09 03:24:44,wallstreetbets,Lol a slow dip is still a dip and i still buy

We just buy it because we like it. And we are retarded. If you like the stock, buy one. Price target for me is  anything less than 200 but i really like the stock at 160. Could go to 40 tomorrow morbing at 900am. Who fuckin knows. This is not financial advice. I throw shit at bananas and make stock buys off the way it splatters. So."

Yeah, RH seems willing to fuck you in those extreme circumstances, but everyone started with Robinhood over Fidelity for a reason I’m guessing"
2021-04-09 00:59:29,wallstreetbets,"They didn’t have the bank roll to cover the insane volumn of trades happening.

This is hive-mind anger gone wild.

I can understand wanting to move to an institution like Fidelity that has enough capital to not even need to use a clearing house like Robinhood does, but the idea that they limited trades for nefarious purposes doesn’t mesh with the fact that Robinhood’s clearing house ran out of money to back the trades and Robinhood couldn’t cover it themselves. 

Yes it fucked the movement... no it wasn’t intentional.

If you don’t believe me just look up Mark Cuban’s AMA in here."
2021-04-08 20:46:54,wallstreetbets,I thought it was gonna be the other week when those witches were out. When are we gonna have a squeeze? You guys keep changing your minds.
2021-04-09 02:15:06,wallstreetbets,"Mark Cuban had an AMA in this sub. I assume he knows what he’s talking about and this was his explanation as well. I think this sub is over-emotional with the Robinhood hate. Yes they fucked us over, but it wasn’t intentional or nefarious, they just couldn’t keep up with the volumn."

Thread I mentioned. Like he says, it can happen again with Robinhood so there’s still good reason to switch to a big bank. The corruption theme is a myth though."

2021-04-08 22:29:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah I would but I only have 5K for investing and if I bought 2 that would be like over 20% of my portfolio and thats CAD so probably like 25% to much risk but yeah I like it as a long term hold when I get more funds
2021-04-09 03:00:46,wallstreetbets,They don’t...
2021-04-08 23:59:29,wallstreetbets,5 phone calls about an hour wait time each and I still haven't gotten reimbursed. Transferred over 6k.

2021-04-08 23:13:55,wallstreetbets,"Td ameritrade, schwab, and ibkr(webull? Maybe more, I'm too restricted regarding trading to know outside major brokers). So I would open fidelity.

They all had less restrictions than robinhood, you could use them, but imo, you need an account that wasn't frozen.

It's just good capitalism. If the best broker doesn't get rewarded, then we literally are contributing to capitalism being shitty."
2021-04-08 23:19:03,wallstreetbets,I hope I have that kind of luck I just transferred to fidelity a few hours ago.

Wallstreet and big banks have so many bullshit loopholes in their favor. It's no surprise there's a larger belief that the market is rigged."

If he owned 25% of his portfolio and the banks owned 75%, and his portfolio drops 25%, he takes a total loss and the banks break even. The article even says most of his banks got out unscathed. But as soon as one bank starts selling the prices drop further. Because they waited, Credit Suisse and Nomura got hit with a few bil in losses but ironically Goldman and MS probably profited LOL because prices had gone up a shitton since they originally lent ol Hwang the cash."

They're actually awesome because it's concetrated, and at times it is basically a 2X TQQQ on steroids

Kinda wish it's purely U.S. FANG+ & twitter is outtie but either it makes or break.

I do like FNGU but I have to mix it with Tqqq/soxl/tmf just to be safe

I do advise not to buy all-in FNGU, because the train has left in Q2-Q3 2020 and it's better to not risk if the Chinese or TSLA suddenly tanks"

We know how to find shit and connect on a level they can't comprehend. We share notes and data, sure they have ppl working there who understand but there are 1000x more on Reddit alone who are better at it than they are. Don't think it's only the shorters who are against us. I think most of wall street, unless on our side of things, don't want this to happen and therefore are banding together to delay the inevitable with the most amount of damage control that they can muster."

2021-04-09 02:29:51,wallstreetbets,"I AM GONNA SPAM THIS SO MUCH TODAY...

If you have shares that are lent out, recall them immediately. If you are unsure, contact your broker and make sure your shares are not lent out. If they are make sure you can get them back and opt out of lending if you can. Otherwise you won't be able to vote at the annual meeting.
Here's some information on what I know:

RH or eToro - You're screwed. They lend your share out, you have no control. Maybe they are nice and get it back for you so you can proxy vote but I am betting not...

Fidelity - You have to have $250k in assets, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

ETrade - Fully paid lending, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

IB - Stock Yield Enhancement Program, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall your shares.

Schwab - Securities Lending Program, must apply, shares become part of a fund or something? You should contact them if you are unsure. I think you may have to contact them to leave the program as well to get your shares back, IDK.

TD - Looks like TD loans your shares out but IDK if you can opt out or if they will automatically recall your shares. It may be the same fund as Schwab, you should contact them to make sure your shares are not lent out.

I hope this helps and if there's any I missed or something is incorrect, please let me know."

If you have shares that are loaned out, recall them immediately. If you are unsure, contact your broker and make sure your shares are not loaned out. If they are make sure you can get them back and opt out of lending if you can. Otherwise you won't be able to vote at the annual meeting. Here's some information on what I know:

RH or eToro - You're screwed. They lend your share out, you have no control. Maybe they are nice and get it back for you so you can proxy vote but I am betting not... Maybe try to contact them, good luck with that...

Fidelity - Fully Paid Lending, must have $250k in assets, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

ETrade - Fully Paid Lending, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

IB - Stock Yield Enhancement Program, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall your shares.

Webull - Stock Lending Income Plan, must opt in, they pick stocks to short, you must leave the program to get stocks back unless they are returned. You should probably contact them.

Schwab - Securities Lending Program, must apply, shares become part of a fund or something? You should contact them if you are unsure. I think you may have to contact them to leave the program as well to get your shares back, IDK.

TD - Looks like TD loans your shares out but IDK if you can opt out or if they will automatically recall your shares. It may be the same fund as Schwab, you should contact them to make sure your shares are not loaned out.

I hope this helps and if there's any I missed or something is incorrect, please let me know.

EDIT: If you are unsure if your shares are loaned out, you should contact your broker."

2021-04-09 03:38:30,wallstreetbets,"Just some info because people keep bringing up Hestia:

Hestia previously had something like 4.5 million shares when they were pushing as an activist investor to get Wolf and one other on the board at the 2020 Annual Meeting. They had already gotten rid of most of those by January of this year. 

In an [8k filed for Wolf on 3/30](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18716/html) he was selling 91k shares on behalf of hestia management, hestia partners still had 319k shares, but since it was indirect ownership those are likely clients shares held by them. Either way even if they get rid of all remaining shares it isn't enough to make a big difference.


I went back and found what I'd previously seen from Jan:

>Director Kurt Wolf’s Hestia Capital Management sold 810,000 GameStop shares on Jan. 12 and 13 for a total of $17.2 million, a per-share average price of $21.22. Wolf is managing member and chief investment officer of Hestia, which now owns 409,600 GameStop shares, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Wolf himself still owns 50,689 GameStop shares in a personal account.

810,000 shares for 17mil on 12 Jan, ouch. At today's price that would have been 141 mil, letalone at any of the highs."

GameStop's stock may be trading in a bullish descending channel. For the stock to move higher, it would need to break through the upper descending trendline of the pattern, which it did temporarily on Thursday before gravitating back into the channel. If GameStop stock can break above the channel, it could reach its next resistance level of about $217.84."

Message:

I am an individual retail investor and would like to express my opinion regarding this new proposed rule SR-NSCC-2021-801.

I  believe this rule - if enacted- is a step in the right direction  towards accountability for those who engage in the short selling/stock  borrowing program. It is time for an update to the current RegSHO  closeout requirements and I believe that this SLD change in process from  Monthly to Daily settlement is progress.

I would like to see this rule passed and implemented immediately.

Lastly on this ruling, I would like to see stronger penalties enacted for non compliance and violation of this rule.

Thank you for your time & consideration in this matter.

Sincerely,"
2021-04-08 21:19:05,wallstreetbets,DFV only has 50k worth of shares and the MMs have already ptepared for delivery. A drop in the bucket compared to the volume needed to force a gamma squeeze. Chances are this only pops off with a share recall or split and gamma squeezes wont trigger a margin call although at 1 point they would have. Just buy hold wait and dont put any hope into specific dates. Its just a staring contest until the margin call.

2021-04-09 12:41:40,wallstreetbets,"As an MM, Citadel has the ability to sell shares short that they don’t actually own. It’s essentially the promise of a share. They have this power to maintain liquidity of the stock (keeping the shelves full for people to buy) while the share is located and purchased. 

BUT they’ve been doing this with no intention of ever actually buying the stock. They are instead hiding the shorted shares by buying deep ITM call options to offset the shorts. 

The goal was for GME to go bankrupt. This would allow them to profit off of the shares they sold without ever having to buy them back, as the stock would be delisted. 

That’s the theory anyway."

**For everyone who needs information on the exit strategy in order to maximize profits, this is the way:**

Do not sell on the way up.  In order to maximize the squeeze, we need to collectively hold. At the top or better yet, slightly after the peak, sell one share.  As the stock is dropping, slowly sell off so as not to drop the share price significantly.  This will allow other apes to take profits and we will cause maximum damage to Shitadel.  If you have 10 shares, it is far better to sell 1 share for $10,000 (just an example) and sell the other 9 shares as the stock price slowly drops, than to sell 10 shares at $1,000 and have nothing left when the price goes much higher.  If everyone decided to sell on the way up, then the stock would never have a chance to squeeze to anywhere close to its full potential and the hedges would get off easy.  We will all have significantly higher gains if we hold and follow the first strategy!  

Apes strong forever!"

2021-04-09 11:59:28,wallstreetbets,"I’m familiar with the situation, but I wanted to know the precise date of this guy’s monologue. It has proven as I expected to be wrong. Bloomberg reports 140% but it’s all based off 13-Fs and other disclosure requirements as of year end. Given the company has already agreed to issue $1bn of stock any “hedgie” that wants to get out can. Sadly, I don’t think there will be a squeeze but you all did great things for the company allowing them to raise equity at a price that’s like 200x inflated. Volkswagen was a very different situation. I don’t get why people still think there could be a short squeeze here. Borrow rates as sub 1%. Who knows though if enough apes keep buying and never sell, maybe you could squeeze some of the remaining shorts but with all that new equity being offered, it seems like that will be very tough."

Part 1
If anyone was here for past stories I did some weird shit only because I was severely bored and usually looking to make money. Rando bets and schemes always a thing. 

Anyway usually the things I did were so complicated and dumb that it caught a lot of attention. By 10th grade they sat me down and let me know I was nearly being expelled and they didn’t understand why I was failing all my classes."
2021-04-08 21:35:18,wallstreetbets,"Part 2 

They were trying to do this experimental school program for “at risk” kids. I already was working a morning job and after school. They wanted a few kids that could prove their theory that if you take out gym and study hall and all that that they could “save” some kids from dropping out. I already was the youngest in my class because I started early. So I had to take a weird iq test to get in. The sold me on “your day will be shorter”"
2021-04-08 21:38:42,wallstreetbets,"Last part 3:

I got in the program and they said you have to work on all this shit here and can’t take it with you, and do it on your own. So it was all high school with 0 extra fluff.

I needed 2.5 years of credits. I wrapped it all up in 3 months and graduated with a high school diploma at 16. They had the program for 3 years but it had a high failure rate and got scrapped"

And a spac is a literal fake scam that generates money from nothing but pure speculation. Even the housing market looks like housing crash 2.0 with every house being sold at double the asking price on some instances. Nobody has this money but the banks and foreign billionaires. Maybe I’m overdramatic but it feels very unsteady and idk when the top comes in"
2021-04-08 21:09:21,wallstreetbets,Thanks man and skipping classes is honestly a power that should not be messed with. Once you skip that first class you start coming up with new and dangerously stupid ways of procrastinating.
2021-04-08 21:38:38,wallstreetbets,"50% or less is pretty common at least for the classes I taught lol, grades seemed to be bimodal most of the time"

2021-04-09 07:22:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm looking at about $120k in cash right now and I want to YOLO it all into TSLA (because I missed getting in on TSLA last year given I spent so much of it literally in the hospital). But part of me also wants to YOLO into PLTR (I'm currently 6k in). I don't have a very diversified portfolio. Not counting this new $120k,  I'm about 17% PLTR, 48% AMD, and 35% TSLA. (I do have another $150k  in a vanguard target 2060 retirement fund, though -- so I try to count that as my diversification - heh).  


The thing is, even getting into TSLA so late as this, I could probably double it in a year. If Cathie is right, I could quadruple it in four years. PLTR could very well still be trading 25-50 in a year. Or even four years.  


I think I'll probably end up moving my TSLA position to 50% to 66% and then maybe doubling my shares of PLTR only if they make that 40% dip to \~$16 that people keep insisting will happen long before we see an upside."
2021-04-09 07:30:54,wallstreetbets,"Yep. I only recently started taking an active role in investing  (ie, not just dumping everything into my vanguard  target 2060 fund), so my position in PLTR has a $24.51 basis. I'm not sure I'm willing to increase my position unless we see a wild dip down to maybe $16.  


I see a lot of potential in PLTR, but I see more immediate potential and return from TSLA (and even AMD, which are my other to big positions). I'm thinking I might go deep in TSLA even as high as it is right now, then pull some off the table next year and use a lot of that for PLTR... because I feel like it's not making any wild prolonged swings for a long time.  


A lot of people are stoked on this Double Click Demo Day thing (god  what an awful name -- it just makes me think of the scummy Double Click advertising company) and seem to think it's going to finally move things.  I'm registered for it and can't wait, but . . . they just have some an *incredibly* difficult time conveying what their software *really* does and what its  *real* potential actually is. I don't know a solution to that. I think their demonstration using the military command center scenerio was quite impressive. I think the  ""it's like a CRM, so when a customer walks into your bank the lender sitting at the desk can automatically know what kind of deals to dangle in front of them!"" demo was... bleh.   


I just have  no idea how you convey something this complex and with this much potential and variance to people who push virtual dollars around on a computer all day. I almost feel like they need a longer demo that maybe takes a fictitious company with a set of concerns and then takes us through what PLTR would do with them from the first day through implementation."

2021-04-09 11:27:53,wallstreetbets,"China is doing something that looks like ethnic cleansing to the Uyghurs yes. However America has a prison system that is deplorable (and on average in many ways worse than China's), has an awful problem of human trafficking and environmental abuse of it's indigenous population, and it's camps for migrants vary between cages or massive inhumane barracks for refugees where there has been reported sterilization and literal gassing.

I'm not gonna do that thing zionists do where they invoke one bad thing their own country is doing to deflect from their own. Far from it people should critique china and that should go into something productive like a BDS on products that use exploitive labor from the camps and people should read stuff from china labor activists (chaung is a good publications but I think there's china labor review or whatever that journal is called im omw to a job interview so can't look it up now) and show actual solidarity with people.

But most of this wave of china backlash is just to fan the ever-growing american military industrial complex and hostile relationships between our two governments which do nothing but benefit the nationalist politicians of both countries. I do hope something productive comes from people talking about china but all I see is stuff pretending China is a uniquely bad imperial power, when it's simply one among a number of countries that is doing fucked up shit"

2021-04-09 15:04:21,wallstreetbets,"Here is the exact quote from the Walgreen's press release on March 31, 2021:

 ""**Company Outlook**

The company raised fiscal 2021 guidance to mid-to-high single digit growth in constant currency adjusted EPS from both total and continuing operations. Previous guidance was for low single-digit growth. The revised guidance reflects first-half performance above expectations and anticipated strong growth in the second half of the fiscal year. The situation continues to be fluid in the second half due to COVID-19.""

Concerning Rite Aid ( RAD ), I am very optimistic concerning the companies prospects.  However, I am only an individual investor with no finanical training or education whatsoever.  Based on your comment, you seem to be a very conservative person when it comes to finances, not the type of indiviudal to YOLO on an uncertain outcome.  I suggest that you stick to your strategy of playing it safe and waiting for proof positive that the company is making progress.  You may miss out on the big run up, but you will still be able to catch some tendies on the back end."
2021-04-09 15:10:20,wallstreetbets,"You’re really expecting a 2-3x this year after they are guiding to lose 100M this year with 200M cash on hand? That’s cutting it close my guy, and I don’t consider myself as conservative"
2021-04-09 16:06:38,wallstreetbets,"You have to read the article to understand.   Last year RAD had a significant negative financial impact due to COVID-19.  That stuation is not only going to be corrected this year with the end to the lockdown, but Rite Aid stands to benefit from the impact of the COVID-19 vaccination program (and perhaps as much as $2+ per share according to the author's estimate).

Can the stock jump 2X or 3X from here to $40 - $60 per share?  Absolutely, depending on the forward looking guidance given on Thursday, April 15th.  Even at $60 per share, you are taling about a market cap that is only $3.3 billion --- That's nothing.  Walgreens has a market cap of nearly $50 billioin and CVS is almost at $100 billion.  So, if RAD management delivers a suprise and guides to high single digit growth this year, Rite Aid stock will rip higher.

Once again, this is not a trade for the faint of heart.  You have to be willing to take a risk to get double or triple your money, and there are never any guarantees in these matters.  So BUYER BEWARE & TAKE BETS ONLY IF YOU DARE!"
2021-04-09 16:18:00,wallstreetbets,"Assuming you’re referring to growth in total revenues, that is already out. For fiscal year 2021, they are expecting 24B in revenues, which is insane, compared to their market cap. And also close to double digit growth. I do not think that sends the stock to  40-60, however. This news isn’t spectacular compared to what they were doing before. They’ve been generating over 20B revenues for the past several years yet still remaining flat/declining, I think investors are more concerned about the 5-10 years ahead. 

To be clear I also own shares at around 19.90, so I’m hoping for the best for the company, but I don’t see how what you’re saying changes investor outlook on things by that much. I’m in the shares simply because I believe a company that generates over 20B in ARR should be worth more than 1B. However nothing has changed over the past few years, really. Maybe I’m missing the autism aspect that WSB will jump on this stock for some unforeseen reason which could push it to a 3x in 2021"

I hear doing the things they love the most is the best way to spend your last days together.

He said he wasn't going to ruin the memory of his dog for the last bits of how sick his dog was. He was going to remember the good times.

As a father of two. I know as soon as we get a house we're gonna get a dog and we're gonna love it and make great memories.

Her favorite thing in the entire world is me. She’s a chihuahua, her favorite thing is to be cuddled up by me, so it’s very easy to make her happy. Second favorite is her cranberry treats, she’s crazy for them. She doesn’t really have the energy for walks anymore, though I’m hoping to work on building her back up. She was doing Better before the vet gave her the wrong medication. A medication not to be used in dogs with kidney issues or seizures. In another week or so I’m gonna start working on doing some home PT with her and try to build her muscle mass back up (the medication caused her to stop eating for a Long time so her body cannibalized her muscles) slowly so that hopefully we can get going on some short walks.  She’s not in any pain, the vet said. I haven’t noticed any painful behavior from her, and in fact have seen improvement so I’m holding on with her. As long as she’s willing to fight, I’m willing to. Once the time comes, I’m hoping to let her pass naturally at home, as long as she isn’t suffering. If she is Suffering, I’ll do right by her and call the vet to have it ended.

A dog is a great choice, really. Your kids are gonna have an awesome friend that they’ll remember fondly for life. My best memories are of my dog. This one year the pond by my house froze over super thick so I took my little 9 pound long haired chihuahua out to the ponds, set her on top of my snow coat and wrapped her in it, and went ice skating in my socks and a t-shirt, and I’d look over and she’d be happily chilling and watching me. Its a very fond memory for me, I hope your kids get just as awesome ones.

Most of the time it’s okay. Most of the time I can focus on the good and being strong for her. The good though is that I even got this time with her. My vet tried to coerce me into putting her down the day after doing a 3 day iv treatment, saying “if she were going to improve she already would have.” Shitty vet. Shes improved Exponentially. She’s walking now, she’s eating on her own, she’s enjoying her treats and enjoying me. This is the good I choose to focus on."

2021-04-08 21:17:07,wallstreetbets,"Where does my comment imply that I can't handle different conclusions?

I'm saying it's a cult because people literally use slogans like cults do. They are wasting money and praising that because they think it's cool to be part of something. They say the same inane and illogical things day in and day out to make themselves feel good. They cite conspiracy theories as evidence to lose money.

They believe some unsubstantiated short squeeze is going to happen that will bankrupt Wall Street. But we already know from experience the game is rigged. Robinhood hasn't really lost much despite manipulating the market. None of the brokers have. Billions lost in a short term sure, but billions gained back. It's like 401k for the people who lost 10s of thousands of dollars during the financial crisis of 2008.

Meanwhile middle class people are putting their mortgages on this and losing big time for the sake of ""sticking it to the man."" Money they won't get back, because they want to be an ape. It's sad, really

If it were for a good stock, that'd be something else, but stock is supposed to reflect the perceived worth of a company based on their performance. GameStop isn't worth $170 per share it's going for now. $50 dollars is high for it. Until this happened, real gamers hated GameStop, because they would buy used games from customers for dollars and sell it for ten or twenty times that.

People in this subreddit are calling others ""paper hands"" for being smart and selling when the opportunity is right. A bunch of stock buying novices are shaming people for not losing money. How is that not crazy?

The stock is inflated in value because of people in this subreddit, but when the bubble finally pops a lot of people are going to be out of a lot of money. This can't last forever, because the company isn't worth the hype. So you might as well tithe or give money to Scientology if you feel like losing money to be part of a group that accepts you. You already drank the Kool-Aid."

Going with your comment, when Apple releases their version of an EV, Tesla is gonna see some market share go away. 

It's easier to be the market leader when you got no serious competition. But that shit is going to change dramatically in 1 - 2  years. 

No brand was putting put decent EVs, now you got a bunch coming out (hummers, mustangs, F150s, corvettes, Cadillac, etc..) and the consumer is ready for choices."

2021-04-08 22:10:45,wallstreetbets,"I sell calls that have a strike price that I’m ok with selling at. So for example, if I’m ok selling PLTR at $30 next week, then I’ll sell the $30 call and collect the premium that the buyer is paying me to buy the call. If the price is $32 when the option expires, then I sell 100 shares to the buyer for $30 a share and the buyer instantly makes $2 a share from me. If it doesn’t make it to $30, then I just keep the shared and profited off of the premium."
2021-04-08 22:12:30,wallstreetbets,Depends if it gets to 40 faster than expected. I’ll hold at least half of these shares for 10+ years. But if it hits 40 in a few months I would shave a little bit off. My expectation is $70-80 in 5 years for reference.

I went back to March, 1996 (25 years ago) and checked MSFT price for an average of $6.30. With $1250 you'd have around 198 stocks.

198 x $253 (current price) = $50k

2021-04-09 10:08:36,wallstreetbets,"Implied Volatility is the risk premium priced into options. As a stock approaches an expected binary event -- like earnings release -- the overall IV on options increases due to the potential expected move.  IV had been decreasing over the last 4 weeks as the actual movements in GME has calmed. 

Over the last 2 days, there is increasing potential hype / expectations on the stock. As such, the expected movement is becoming larger and larger as people think we are getting closer to MOASS. This is evidenced in the climbing IV from 169% two mornings ago to 199% Friday morning -- despite the price DROPPING.

It wasn't the price action driving IV climb -- it was all the corporate actions that have happened and what MIGHT happen next."

I'm selling $1 puts for sndl right now, collected $9-12 for it using $200. And I'm also going back to stocks. Bought $100 worth of SNDL yesterday to sell a covered call on RH, to see what gave me more credit(selling put or call),but couldn't sell a covered call, yesterday - that would have expired today - because it may have been assigned and I had no day-trades left.(learning your trading platform is important!\~) I sold the 100 shares for a $5 profit today(When it was at $1.05) and used that money to sell a $1 strike price put, putting up $100 as collateral for another $5-$7. (since the price is so more near $1 than $1.5 (My sell put / sell call targets, respectively, I sold the shares, like I said, and ended up selling 2 $1 strike price puts for Apr. 16th Gaining\~ $15) with $200 so far this week with some super low-risk plays!\~ (This is now my ""Safe money,"" I shall start building up!\~)

AMC is not an American brand. It was, but they sold out in 2012. It's now owned by the massive Chinese conglomerate Wanda group. They bought 100% of the company. AMC is literally a Chinese company. 

Or, it was. I don't know what % they own now, but when AMC stock rallied, Wanda absolutely sold the shit out of their shares, profiting absurdly off of the euphoria. All the AMC rally did was allow a bunch of Chinese billionaires to profit off of (and exit) a dying American company. It was fucked. 

This is why this ""WSB activism"" is problematic. You don't think it through. You're out here gambling your life savings to bail out Chinese billionaires, which is not a moral mission in any way. You're being used, and you think you think you're somehow saving an American icon, when all you're actually doing it helping Chinese billionaires pick apart an American company for parts. That's a problem. 

If you actually wanted to help Americans, or ""save the American movie experience,"" you'd let AMC die so independent cinema owners could stand a chance."

2021-04-09 16:33:04,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't matter it the timing advance is derived from a separate message or not.  For LTE, if your timing advance is off by more than 70 microseconds, you missed your time slot entirely, and the base station won't hear any message you send.  At 35 microseconds off, you are losing about 3dB of signal strength, so it is still possible your message will get missed.  Any time division multiplexed system is going to have similar problems with completely or partially missing their time slot although the exact numbers will vary.  Even having a rough guess at the right timing in advance can speed up the connect negotiation process by eliminating failures to communicate with the wrong timing advance."

2021-04-09 09:15:05,wallstreetbets,So 200% SI is the true upper limit if every share is shorted once?
2021-04-09 12:53:04,wallstreetbets,"No, the process can be repeated infinitely.

Imagine you have 1 share and you repeat that short cycle 5 times 
You have 5 shorts and 6 longs 

For 1 share you have 5 shorts 
That’s 500% short interest
But the more in demand “shorting” is, the higher the interest charges, discouraging it.  Just like high IV on options"
2021-04-09 14:52:49,wallstreetbets,The suggestion from apes is that they were shorting more shares than were available to borrow so they there was really one short and one long. What actually happens is not A borrows from B before selling. They just sell in the hope that they will find one that could be borrowed later. When this didn’t happen you get what’s called a failure to deliver. Then I run out of wrinkles and I’m not sure what happens next.

2021-04-08 23:49:32,wallstreetbets,"I'll address both questions, but I'll start with my biggest weakness:

Deviating from the plan. When you go into a trade, you should have a plan, from start to finish. It sucks, because it takes time to evaluate a company, but to be a successful trader over any time period, you must have a plan, and that has to be backed by both fundamentals and catalysts. Example questions:

What are my price targets, and when? how? where are my lows/highs, and based on what? Fundamentally, what is the company worth (based on *actual* fundamental analysis). What will change that?

The second question, ""when to know to take profit"" is answered by the above proposition.

Before you press ""buy"", you should know your valuations, precise exit and entry points, when those could be triggered (if early/late), and finally, the discipline to recognize profit is profit.

Have a thesis, and stick to a thesis. Making a 100% of what you thought you could make, but missing out on that extra 200%, feels a whole lot better than waiting too long and making 10%, or nothing.

2021-04-08 20:16:22,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, the HFEA portfolio has basically transformed into a max Sharpe ratio portfolio. They never really took risk parity seriously. They just wanted to leverage a balanced fund and the Bridgewater risk parity funds are known for that. 

If you take the simulated returns from 1987-today, the implied Kelly criterion would have you leverage the 55/45 UPRO/TMF portfolio another 2.4x (i.e. 396/324 SPY/TLT). So I don't think it over bets. 

The portfolio doesn't really require dropping rates. As long as rates are not rising (so they could be flat) and treasuries continue to be negatively correlated with equities the portfolio should do quite well. 

I was invested in a form of HFEA but I have recently dropped my treasury position due to worries about potential inflation. So now I have an all equity portfolio as you do."
2021-04-09 00:34:36,wallstreetbets,"Just checked back on my notes. First time I did it was with 40/60 UPRO/TMF but you seem like a nice fella so I recomputed with your 55/45.

1. Using data for LT bonds and US stocks from 1952, LT bonds had an excess return over cash (adjusting for rate changes) of 1.7% with StDev of 11.77%. Stocks had excess over cash (valuation-adjusted) of 5% with StDev of 16.66%. Correlation was 0.07% but I was nice and called it zero. Rf I've set to 0% since it doesn't matter for purposes of finding the Kelly portfolio. Besides, it's easier to work with the excess returns above.
2. Plugging in 55/45 gives a portfolio with E(x) 3.515% (showing work in case you want to confirm, always good to have someone double-check). I find that if I can leverage by borrowing at the RFR, the Kelly portfolio is 3.1x leverage. With a borrowing cost of 0.5%, the Kelly portfolio is 2.7x leverage. If we accounted for the ridiculous expense ratios, it gets even worse.

Have no idea what numbers you're using to come up with a hilarious 3\*2.4=7.2X leverage as the implied Kelly portfolio. Maybe you're using the actual returns since 1987, which are obviously highly inflated from valuation changes. It's always best to control for valuation changes to have a better idea of the excess return over cash (a technique I use from Arnott and Bernstein 2002). I checked the correlation since 1987 and it was -11%. Using that, I get that the optimal leverage is actually right about 3x, including a margin rate of 0.5%. But it is below 3x leverage once you factor in the ERs.

Sorry, any way I slice it, I don't see how 55/45 UPRO/TMF does not over bet. More importantly, it has no international diversification, no smart beta, and it wastes money in ER. That's gonna be a hard no for me bud."
2021-04-09 01:22:59,wallstreetbets,"I was just lazy and took the volatility and Sharpe ratio from portfoliovisualizer. I don’t think those are credible numbers and I certainly don’t think HFEA is perfect. I would add international diversification and use portfolio margin and/or futures to implement the asset allocation. The point is that I can see how some could make the case that adding treasuries can increase your portfolio’s Sharpe ratio and consequently increase the amount of leverage you would apply. 

Maybe HFEA overshoots the Kelly criterion, I don’t think most would really mind. I imagine you are computing optimal CAGR under the assumption of no contributions. At your stage maybe that is starting to be a good approximation. For those starting out, it is going to be too conservative."
2021-04-09 01:43:18,wallstreetbets,"Couple of thoughts:

1) Yeah, taking historical returns will give you results consistent with that history. If you take data from a period with favorable valuation changes and apply that as the metric for the Kelly portfolio, then you're implicitly assuming continuation of those valuation changes. I prefer assuming that valuations will simply stay constant.  
2) Uh yes, I would agree that adding treasuries can increase a Sharpe ratio. But I never contested this? My initial response was ""but probably not in the proportion of HFEA"" and ""even if it WERE in that proportion, maximizing Sharpe is not my goal, max CAGR is"".  
3) Let me get this right: You're saying that if you showed people using HFEA that they are overbetting, and that if they reduced their leverage, they would actually get a higher CAGR, that most would not mind? Most will say ""actually, I would rather not decrease the leverage and increase my CAGR because I am contributing to this account a la Lifecycle Investing"". Because if so, I wouldn't believe you at first. That was certainly not the case with the OP, whose entire premise was a one-time investment that would be left by itself for decades. But I admit I haven't gone to that site and thread in ages, so I'll take your word for it."
2021-04-09 02:01:33,wallstreetbets,"I guess I don’t disagree with you. I rejected HFEA myself for a lot of the reasons you point out. Perhaps I just don’t think it’s as bad of a portfolio as you do. 

Correct me if I am wrong but can’t you max CAGR by just picking allocation weights to max Sharpe then pick optimal leverage?

Perhaps the early contributors were planning never to contribute after the initial start but that is not my impression of the current participants. I am probably wrong in that there are likely some on there that have as a pessimistic outlook on bonds as you do that they should deleverage."
2021-04-09 02:29:39,wallstreetbets,"To your question, yes, those are equivalent **given no borrowing frictions**. Once you introduce frictions, then that does not hold any more. Simple proof: Imagine borrowing was infinitely expensive. With one method, you'd find the Sharpe portfolio (say 50/50 stocks/bonds) and then... not leverage it since any borrowing is too expensive. But if you just directly solve for the highest CAGR, you'll get 100% stocks (still unleveraged of course). So I just personally solve directly for the Kelly portfolio, given my ERs and leverage costs. The premise of HFEA (find the Sharpe portfolio, which is Risk Parity, and then leverage 3x) fails on every front. Risk Parity is almost certainly not the Sharpe portfolio. Even if it were, borrowing frictions means you don't want to just find the Sharpe and leverage it that proportion. And even if you're using the wrong proportion for max CAGR, they still leveraged past Kelly size lmao.  


Also, for the record, I don't have a pessimistic or optimistic outlook on neither bonds or stocks. I am simply using the excess return over cash, valuation adjusted, from the past. I don't think that's pessimistic or optimistic, IMO it is **realistic**. If you think assuming that rates will stay flat (neither up or down) in my choice of investment is a pessimistic outlook on bonds, that strikes me as strange."

Please, thats not an advice, i dont wont to be responsible for anyone`s loss of liquidity."
2021-04-09 09:26:24,wallstreetbets,"When confirmation bias fails*

Lies and deceptions!"
2021-04-09 11:03:45,wallstreetbets,...or the hell :(
2021-04-09 13:49:19,wallstreetbets,"Honestly it’s tough to say.  
Ssr is at $152.8 today 4/9, currently 154.xx
Will it go down to that? Ya probably but we don’t know.  
Hf are playing a physiological game.  
  
I’m jacked and loaded for tendies"
2021-04-09 11:07:48,wallstreetbets,We'll be eating tendies or nuggies at the end of this
2021-04-09 05:13:27,wallstreetbets,Well done buddy
2021-04-09 18:21:38,wallstreetbets,!remindme 65 hours
2021-04-08 20:15:58,wallstreetbets,"First, thanks for the responses.  The last question spoken about was my incredulous reaction to a few comments relating to ""to the moon"" and $150 a share type stuff.  Yes, to offer a small premium can and does happen, but no moon shots.  If the stock does anything but move sideways until an acquisition, I will eat my words.  Best of luck out there!"
2021-04-08 23:55:48,wallstreetbets,update?
2021-04-09 13:32:16,wallstreetbets,"you guys just brought a tear to my eye, I haven't heard that song in years."

2021-04-09 18:07:29,wallstreetbets,"chip fabs are a very capital intensive business.   I wouldn't want to own this stock, especially after this run-up."
2021-04-09 00:55:16,wallstreetbets,Yo freshen up this post
2021-04-09 19:21:02,wallstreetbets,Would love an update heading into next week.
2021-04-09 16:45:47,wallstreetbets,New week...
2021-04-09 18:07:34,wallstreetbets,No update?
2021-04-09 12:20:15,wallstreetbets,Where’s the update plz make me purr
2021-04-09 11:06:35,wallstreetbets,"Pls update, man. The apes are losing it"
2021-04-09 17:16:42,wallstreetbets,so he will just let it expire in the money? or sell his call?
2021-04-09 16:59:33,wallstreetbets,"Probly regret that, but do u."
2021-04-09 12:59:10,wallstreetbets,"Not sure if you had figured it out yet, but he has 500 contracts expiring today. That means he has the right to buy 100 shares, per contract, at $12 each. So 500 contracts x 100 shares x $12 per share = $600k cost. But then he can immediately turn around and sell all of those shares at the current price, which is ~$160 per share"
2021-04-09 14:08:45,wallstreetbets,I thought I had it figured out until you said 100 shares per contract. Where'd the 100 shares come from? I guess on margin calls each contract is worth 100 share which i didn't know.
2021-04-09 14:12:25,wallstreetbets,"Thats just the way options are (dont ask why, its just the way it is lol). Thats why you multiply the price for options by 100 for the total cost, since the price you see is per share. So if you see the premium of an option at $1.50, thats $1.50 per share or $150 total for 100 shares"
2021-04-09 14:26:08,wallstreetbets,"Ahh I see. Wait, doesn't his call end on the 16th?"
2021-04-09 14:30:21,wallstreetbets,"Thee 500 contracts expire next friday at 4pm. But since they are in the money (the share price is trading above his $12 strike price) he can decide to exercise the options and pay the $600k to buy 50,000 shares at that time. He can also just sell the options for $7-8million, but he will probably exercise to buy the shares"
2021-04-09 14:37:16,wallstreetbets,"I see, i see. Thank you so much for the help and info. 

So these are margin accounts where you can do puts and calls? I can't do that since mines a cash account. 

Really seems like margin accounts make money"
2021-04-09 14:38:51,wallstreetbets,"No, margin accounts have nothing to do with your ability to buy calls or puts. They just allow you to borrow money and/or use your cash faster without having to let it settle for 2-3 days after each trade. You’re probably just not approved for options trading. Thats as simple as just applying for it through your broker"
2021-04-08 21:17:17,wallstreetbets,"that'll be the next one I buy without a doubt, thanks for the insight"
2021-04-09 13:17:57,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 2 days
2021-04-09 19:16:40,wallstreetbets,"I mean... by some market hypotheses there is no publically available information which has not been used in the price discovery of the given asset.

Of course markets aren't truly efficient but you are demonstrably wrong that institutions move slower than retail investors to react to news. That's an absurd statement. 

The fact that you are posting about this news means it is available. Do you genuinely believe you are the only participant in possession of this information? There are entire for-profit newsletters that track and quantify index changes or institutional movements to a level of granularity you by yourself could never achieve..."
2021-04-09 01:25:10,wallstreetbets,Hope you sold then bud. Do some AMC DD bro if they even make .50€ eps this or next quarter I'll shit myself a new asshole. If your gonna fight shorts go over to GME. Post the loss/gain porn plz
2021-04-09 01:26:27,wallstreetbets,"I have gme shares

Sold my calls for 80% profit 

Holding my shares"
2021-04-09 16:39:47,wallstreetbets,\^ Dead on about $DGX pullback to $125ish this week. Now let's see if it runs.
2021-04-09 00:56:39,wallstreetbets,Is it time yet?
2021-04-08 21:28:41,wallstreetbets,Counting
2021-04-08 21:35:24,wallstreetbets,Today I bought more shares.
2021-04-09 00:54:48,wallstreetbets,"That is great , I need to also buy July Calls"
2021-04-09 17:40:42,wallstreetbets,I bought more shares today.
2021-04-08 23:23:06,wallstreetbets,You mentioned you still have some 500 and  800 C at this point you will continue to hold correct ?
2021-04-08 22:40:42,wallstreetbets,Followup: if SI% is say 40% and not 100%. Does that then mean the squeeze will not happen for a lot of people. Only 40% get the price they want.
2021-04-09 00:22:04,wallstreetbets,"sitting on July 800s now, bought some time to be right, and thousands of shares that I hold near and dear. Each one is like my own child. very precious to me."
2021-04-09 00:25:42,wallstreetbets,"if SI is 40%, the net buying of 40% of the available float in a very short time can lead to huge price movements. I think we are WAY above 40% of the float. If only there was a way to count the shares that everyone thinks they ""own"". I say we are 200%+ the float. Its literally impossible to cover all at once, it would have to iteratively unwind the borrowed stock chain."
2021-04-09 10:38:14,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Might buy like a July or august 800c

2021-04-09 01:25:49,wallstreetbets,Welp. I've lost $330 (90%) on ui puts now lol Hopefully it drops before the 16th and I can re coop some of those loses.
2021-04-08 21:11:35,wallstreetbets,Time to get those shares back
2021-04-09 00:08:12,wallstreetbets,"Eh, picked up more AMD - I like the stock & am long for sure"
2021-04-09 06:14:21,wallstreetbets,Good move. I stayed away because of the chip shortages
2021-04-08 20:32:23,wallstreetbets,Ok... Now sell. :)
2021-04-08 20:37:48,wallstreetbets,I did earlier today for a much larger profit than when these losers told me to sell.
2021-04-08 20:56:10,wallstreetbets,Good job! Nice play
