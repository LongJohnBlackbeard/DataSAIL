2021-04-20 19:58:43,stocks,Can you see the future?
2021-04-20 19:44:46,stocks,"Thanks for this, OP!

Although I'll research but does anyone know anything about Vestas?"
2021-04-20 19:48:31,stocks,"Here's what I can give you, straight from tradingview:

Vestas Wind Systems A/S engages in the development, manufacture, sale, and maintenance of wind power plants. It operates through the Power Solutions and Service segments. The Power Solutions segment comprises the sale of wind power plants and wind turbines. The Service segment includes the sale of service contracts, spare parts, and related activities. The company was founded by Smith Hansen and Peder Hansen in 1945 and is headquartered in Aarhus, Denmark.

They look like a solid company. P/E of 40, which I would argue is slightly undervalued. A very established company with a $250 billion market cap. They've increased YOY revenue over the past 3 years, pulling in a revenue of $110 billion. It'd be interesting to know whether they have a monopoly on Wind Power plants though.

Edit: These numbers may actually be in Danish Kronens, which would translate to a $40 billion market cap and $17.8 billion in revenue. Far from monopoly level, but incredible numbers nonetheless"
2021-04-20 19:25:44,stocks,"Big institutions tend to go long when they hold sizable stakes. They almost have too. If an institution like BR or Berkshire were to randomly dump a stonk without a solid justification, the SEC could/ would fine them for market manipulation because of the ripples made in the share holder confidence and market indexes. Large firms have to generally have a packet of DD for every move they make."
2021-04-20 19:08:25,stocks,Look at chipotle. High institutional ownership.
2021-04-20 19:11:55,stocks,I think those stocks are much more volatile obviously. A sell off by a big institution like that if they wake up one morning and don’t like the stock anymore means a more dramatic price drop per share
2021-04-20 19:30:14,stocks,"That makes sense, I mostly just figured that a high number of shares being held just means there's fewer shares available to be more actively bought/sold to change the share price"
2021-04-20 19:12:27,stocks,"And from what I can tell, analysts are generally bullish on CMG, but I wasn't sure if there was a direct correlation, or if there was a maximum amount of institutional ownership that could be a negative sign"
2021-04-20 19:23:54,stocks,"That happens very rarely.  When institutions want to exit a large position they typically do it very slowly to not tank their sell price. 

Look at what happened when they started unloading their VIAC and DISCA positions all at once.  This is not something institutions like to do."
2021-04-20 19:19:25,stocks,"That makes sense, appreciate the input!"
2021-04-20 19:39:25,stocks,"This is why, say BR doesnt go balls deep in AMC on a Tuesday and buy 25M shares. They know MOASS is coming, they like money, but if they were to take that large of a stake, then it go lunar and they cash in, they would be Propper Fucked Tommy. They would crash AMC, deatroy consumer confidence and then the SEC would say that they were in bed with Hedgie because they facilitated hedgie by loaning shorts through ETFs and then bought further which contributed to the short. They would say it was conspiratorial and would come down hard for playing both sides against the middle. Instaed BR may open a CEF and pick up a 100K a week here and there."
2021-04-20 19:16:41,stocks,I think by looking at who owns CMG it answers your question.
2021-04-20 19:29:17,stocks,$VIAC & $DISCA more had to do with brokers trying to outdo each other in recouping potential losses during the margin call.
2021-04-20 19:38:47,stocks,But it’s not normal market behavior for institutions
2021-04-20 19:53:29,stocks,No but OP was hinting at a “what if” scenario from how I read his post. Nothing is unheard of these days.
2021-04-20 19:28:22,stocks,">Record stimulus, record low rates, high savings still, herd immunity being reached in 1st world countries, Unemployment certainly under no real dire threat of greatly rising.



You said it yourself, everyone already believes this and is investing as if its happening. So where exactly is growth going to come from if everyones money is already in the pot assuming these things are coming? Its no new or wild idea to think the recovery has been priced in for a while and its one of the reasons some companies have beyond absurd growth that exceeds pre covid marketcap."
2021-04-20 19:21:16,stocks,Buy QQQ and SPX naked calls. Stocks only go up forever. Bear markets are a myth.
2021-04-20 19:39:16,stocks,😂 will you be writing those?
2021-04-20 18:54:16,stocks,Netflix said themselves that they will never be able to come close to the new subscription numbers they got during the pandemic.
2021-04-20 19:33:02,stocks,I unsubscribed because it simply ran out of good shows to watch....
2021-04-20 19:03:40,stocks,Time to replace the N in FAANG.
2021-04-20 18:56:37,stocks,"They keep hiking up the prices, what did they think was going to happen. Shit, if there's one more in the next year, I'm unsubbing too."
2021-04-20 19:41:37,stocks,Streaming market is getting way too saturated and consumers are sick of having to figure out which ones they want to subscribe to. A little M&A action would be useful.
2021-04-20 18:48:30,stocks,Maybe stop raising prices every year and produce trash shows
2021-04-20 19:26:29,stocks,They have good content but getting too expensive. But as others have stated it aint no coincidence theyre reporting lower numbers after a price increase.
2021-04-20 18:54:35,stocks,"Oh yeah, the loss in subscribers has nothing to do with the price increases (making competition with better content at a lower price more enticing) and nothing to do with cancelling shows after one season. “It’s covid’s fault” which anyone with a brain would realize covid increases number of people at home with nothing to do, thus increasing subscribers. 

Shit company."
2021-04-20 18:47:04,stocks,They’re producing trash and it’s catching up to them. Or people getting smarter and realizing they don’t have pay for something they can find for free online
2021-04-20 18:49:22,stocks,"So, is it a buy right now?"
2021-04-20 19:18:37,stocks,"HBO Max is so much better and cheaper.   

Netflix needs a discount on a 1 year pay ahead membership, like xbox live.  What we do is watch all the shows that we really like, then cancel for 3-4 months until new shows pile up."
2021-04-20 18:54:42,stocks,"Short-sited selling. 

They are raising prices (which offsets the decelerating growth), have a wide moat of original content and will continue to grow at a good clip for the foreseeable future, including internationally."
2021-04-20 19:48:17,stocks,They got rid of the office and their content lately has been terrible.  Not surprised
2021-04-20 19:26:31,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-20 18:50:55,stocks,"This trend will continue, especially as the pandemic slows and dies."
2021-04-20 19:05:22,stocks,Priced in... (/s)
2021-04-20 19:31:51,stocks,FAAG?
2021-04-20 19:47:06,stocks,N is for NVDA
2021-04-20 19:09:12,stocks,FAGMA
2021-04-20 19:07:51,stocks,replace the N with T?
2021-04-20 19:47:34,stocks,The quality of new releases is horrrrrrrible.  For a time there was a non-stop cadence of must-watch shows. Now it’s c-level movies and teenage dramas.
2021-04-20 19:53:23,stocks,This. I literally just canceled my subscription this month (today is the last day). Hasn't really been worth the $13.99 for me.
2021-04-20 19:03:12,stocks,Lots of trash but also good things regularly. I can’t find any other streaming platform that compares to it.
2021-04-20 18:59:31,stocks,I agree. We are ready to cancel. Not enough new good content. Plenty of garbage though!
2021-04-20 19:20:38,stocks,I literally cancelled yesterday.
2021-04-20 19:01:24,stocks,Or get a Netflix account from China for less than 4$ a month...been doing that for two years
2021-04-20 19:05:01,stocks,I’m very surprised it’s lasted this long
2021-04-20 18:51:35,stocks,I would say yea. I think they have room to bounce back as long as the pandemic is ongoing. I have Disney plus as well and it’s not better in my opinion.  maybe Amazon prime is. No matter what Netflix is still at the top of the food chain for a while to come
2021-04-20 19:20:27,stocks,"I don’t know, they have some good original content but have lost the ability to license and stream basically all other content worth anything to the studios/production companies that own the rights. Most things available are D+ offerings."
2021-04-20 19:54:21,stocks,If they keep cancelling shows like they have been I think they might run into some trouble. No one wants to see a show they are interested in left on a cliffhanger after 1-2 seasons. The number of shows they have done this to is ridiculous.
2021-04-20 19:22:22,stocks,Clearly that needs Netflix in it
2021-04-20 19:55:16,stocks,"Hello, 

I started playing around in the stock market at 13. I am now 35. Here is what I wish I would have known when I was 13.   


1.  Investing and Trading are two completely different things. Investing is relatively safe over the long haul. Trading is extremely competitive, most people lost money trading, give up on it and move on. 
2. You can invest in a fund where you give a company money, and an investing professional will invest in companies on your behalf. This is generally the safest form of investing in stocks. You can pick riskier funds, like Vanguard's VGT which only invests in technology companies, or you can invest in SPY, which invests in 500 different companies all at once across all industries. 
3. You can invest in individual stocks, which is more risky than investing in a fund. 
4. Trading is what a lot of people got into out of boredom during the pandemic. A winning trade where you have a $10,000 gain overnight is exciting, but these wins are rare. Most of the time, people throw away their gains on losing trades after their first big gain. I'm not going to tell you not to do it, but just know that there is a huge learning curve, and you can lose all your money very quickly.   

5. I'm assuming you're under age, so all of your trading will have to be done with the permission of a guardian or parent. 

If you have any questions, let me know."
2021-04-20 18:20:58,stocks,"Oh peanut, they will eat you alive."
2021-04-20 18:37:26,stocks,"I would advise paper trading for practice first. That will help you learn the fundamentals. 

Or so they tell me. Looking at my portfolio right now, I’m clearly terrible at this."
2021-04-20 18:54:17,stocks,dont.
2021-04-20 18:23:59,stocks,"Don’t day trade, look for undervalued companies. There’s a Reddit called r/undervaluedstocks check them out. Just hold forever untill you have substantial gains. Put a good percentage of your portfolio into the apples and Microsoft’s as well as etfs"
2021-04-20 19:32:57,stocks,"I’m not gonna lie to you, your portfolio will do quite well with 95% in the S&P 500. It seems boring but look at it marching while we are all blood red. Use the 5% to play around if you want, but be careful. Also check out compounding interest. It’ll change your financial life."
2021-04-20 19:47:42,stocks,Not if he buys and holds index or mutual funds.
2021-04-20 19:25:39,stocks,The last post on that sub was 56 days ago...
2021-04-20 18:07:36,stocks,Netflix and Disney are leaders.  The pull back on Netflix was bound to happen at some point given their growth in 2020.  Netflix and Disney are both looking like good buying opportunities at their current prices.
2021-04-20 19:23:35,stocks,Dis
2021-04-20 18:51:08,stocks,Back down to $475 we go and then it’s back on the gravy train 📉📈
2021-04-20 18:08:31,stocks,Netflix is trash they always take out good shows and switch it with shows that have gay people in it

then the premium channel providers that most people are familiar with.... also the first to get axed in family budget situations...."
2021-04-20 18:20:35,stocks,"Readly, Small cap about newspapers"
2021-04-20 19:19:11,stocks,I'll take the down votes to agree. promoting and doubling down on highly controversial content such as botderline kiddy porn is not a solid business plan.
2021-04-20 18:25:01,stocks,U r trash
2021-04-20 18:37:55,stocks,I agree

2021-04-20 17:57:28,stocks,Maybe look at some “value factor” ETFs.
2021-04-20 18:27:07,stocks,They dropped today. Time to start a position.
2021-04-20 18:05:50,stocks,"Time in the market beats timing, every day of the week (except weekends)"
2021-04-20 19:37:46,stocks,"Right now the only saving grace in my portfolio are the dividend ETFs, all of which are up 11-16% YTD. Can't hurt to buttress your portfolio with them, so at the very least you'll have some house money to play with every quarter."
2021-04-20 18:11:44,stocks,It’s depending on what sector ETF your going with. That’s the beautiful thing about them for long term investing sector ETFs are diversified growth. My ETF portfolio is a mix of Vanguard ETFs growth and value along with utility and some 3 ARK ETFs because of there growth exposure. These are all in my ROTH IRA so it’s long term 20+ years rather than my “play portfolio “.
2021-04-20 17:57:24,stocks,"Yes, buy the dips!"
2021-04-20 17:57:34,stocks,"I probably wouldn’t be able to answer this appropriately either way but you might get better feedback from others if you list the tickers you’re considering.

I like the ARKs (I’ve got K and X) they haven’t been doing that well so it’s either a good time to buy or a harbinger of an ominous future."
2021-04-20 19:24:55,stocks,"Nope. The purpose of buying an ETF is to park your money in it for years. If you buy VTI, QQQ, SPY it’s guaranteed that they will be higher in 5 years"

You may be able to recreate such an ETF synthetically, for example being long VTI, while being short VXUS for the fraction of VTI that derives income overseas, allowing you to hedge international exposure.  This strategy is, of course, a bit counterproductive."
2021-04-20 18:02:06,stocks,Are joking? Many if not most companies have a portion of sales from outside the usa .
2021-04-20 17:25:58,stocks,1 month low is nothing. I’d argue DIS took off too far and too fast relative to their parks’ status last year. I’d imagine some further consolidation or room to fall considering the way Netflix got bludgeoned today.
2021-04-20 18:58:38,stocks,"I rate it as a buy for a light position. 

I think it might be preparing for an earnings run up since their earnings are on 5/13 (according to RH).

I actually just booked a Disney vacation and think their earnings will be great as everyone continues to get vaccinated and booking vacations. 

I think they’ll have a good future outlook for the rest of the year. Just my thoughts. Good luck investing and/or trading!"

2021-04-20 18:35:55,stocks,"I'm holding off right now for a few reasons:

1) None of their cruise ships (roughly 1/4 to 1/3 of their revenue) are running right now, and are indefinitely postponed

2) Not sure how many of their 87 million Disney+ subscribers are part of the ""free 1 year if Verizon member"" club; will they stay once they have to pay?

3) The transition to streaming from theaters, although probably the best long term move, may have some growing pains. For example, many of their recent superhero movies pulled in 1 billion each. Definitely not getting that with streaming, unless they do what they did with Mulan: charge $30 to stream it.

I might start a small position, but personally would say wait until 160 or 170."
2021-04-20 18:40:54,stocks,Nobody can or will ever convince me Disney is at a discount as long as its share price is higher than it was pre covid.

2021-04-20 17:33:50,stocks,I’m shocked they never REALLY fell below $100 for any sustainable period of time. I lost a few on some Dis shorts in 2020.   Or close to broke even.    Now the whole market seems high
2021-04-20 17:35:17,stocks,"People are just super bullish on streaming for some reason. I get the excitement in part, but genuinely the content pipeline seems lackluster across the board and I didn’t realize effectively recreating a cable package was something to pump Disney to 200 dollars on. While their parks are still closed."
2021-04-20 18:10:41,stocks,"Well, Dis is owns Alot of content, and has some great Marvel and Star Wars shows coming up.

None of the other streaming services have anywhere near as solid IP."
2021-04-20 18:25:44,stocks,For some reason lol This is Disney transitioning into digital world. Disney+ will have the best retention out of all platforms + they have the best IP available. Its defo a buy
2021-04-20 18:29:05,stocks,"Your statement is just sentiments and not hard statistics. Also, the space is competitive. They have great IP’s that’s true but every other major player is spending big too for market share. No one knows what’ll happen but I’m curious to see how it all plays out."

2021-04-20 16:43:18,stocks,"Nah, there are way more forces involved than Reddit. Tons of day traders, swing/scalp, people who are happy with 10%, people who FOMO at the top and sell after it drops.  Without a doubt Reddit can influence movement but the majority of movement is people who prefer making profits over diamond hand memes.

2021-04-20 16:58:51,stocks,"My quick glance analysis: Slower growth than some other payment plays, while still not profitable. Also currently getting drug down along with most smaller tech & anything SPAC of late so it may take a solid earnings or two to turn that sentiment around. I never looked at it closely enough to see how the deal was structured, so depending the terms it could mean some pipe dump risk yet.

With that said I think it’s trading at a lower multiple now than anything in the general payments space aside from FISV, so you can see it as either undervalued or that everything else is still overvalued."
2021-04-20 17:25:32,stocks,It could go down instead of up

Constant negative profit margins, i.e. never really made any money. 5bil in debt 7bil in assets, that's really poor.

Also not sure where you see that they are in debt, but there are no 'cool companies' popping up that do what paysafe does.

Also you must not have seen that they issued the Coinbase Debit Card..  they will benefit from Coinbase.  They also process Draftkings payments..  thats double huge.  Then they also contract with Spotify and Fortnite.

So yeah, again, they have tons of 'competition' huh?"

Maybe so, but if that is the case what makes you think that there never will be competitors. In tech space, every company very quickly has number of copycats and typically one of them does it better sooner or later. Or if its super profitable niche what's stopping big players like GPN or FIS coming in."
2021-04-20 18:48:08,stocks,Stocks with wide moat usually. That helps in terms of competition.
2021-04-20 18:28:34,stocks,"I believe the majority of the mojo here is in Bill Foley being involved.  He is proven successful and has a great track record with Fidelity.  There could be competitors but Paysafe has been doing this 1996, so I’m sure they know all the industry inside and out.  They were much bigger in Europe so that’s why you may not be familiar.  Also they make 10% growth or so YOY, they are not even close to being in any debt.  

Also I think the big thing they have over any competition is bill foleys connection to casinos.  Supposedly Paysafe wants to help implement the first cashless casinos and be the preferred digital wallet.  I believe it, and bill foley believes it so that’s enough for me, I don’t see any real competition for them, it’s a deep value play no question."

2021-04-20 16:21:12,stocks,Buying opportunity or buying a company that peaked due to COVID19? there are alot more competitors taking NFLX's market share now
2021-04-20 16:46:41,stocks,"Honestly, good.

I've been seriously considering demoting Netflix to ""when there's something I want to watch"" status instead of ""subscribe every month"" status in part because they keep canceling shows I like and keep introducing normie bullshit and then showing me how it dominates the top 10."
2021-04-20 16:21:19,stocks,Those are solid numbers.

2021-04-20 17:26:26,stocks,Interesting idea that “The COVID-driven acceleration may have been so great that the high growth expected for the coming years might now never come. Netflix may have accidentally leapfrogged its way to maturity.”
2021-04-20 16:39:12,stocks,Hoping this means promising news to come for Disney+ rather than a streaming market-wide trend
2021-04-20 18:21:40,stocks,"I do somewhat agree with everyone saying ""NFLX is the king is streaming"" NFLX is the biggest streaming service since they produce the most amount of Original content and they have the most amount of stuff to watch. I see NFLX as quantity over quality. For every 10 original content they create, one item is worth watching. When I had Netflix, It was hard to find something to watch. With competition such as Disney+ & HBO Max, NFLX will have to put up a good fight. I cancelled my NFLX subscription when they lost ""The Office"""
2021-04-20 16:21:13,stocks,I think once the majority of businesses are reopened a lot of these streaming stocks will take hits as people cancel their subs.
2021-04-20 18:25:13,stocks,"It was going to happen eventually with HBO, Disney+, and other competitors coming in. Netflix also hasn't had many releases people were hyped for as production stagnated, and that's why they've been trying to tap into new areas such as anime, which has seen their popularity soar in the latter half of 2020 and this year in expense of traditional TV shows. Netflix is especially vulnerable since their streaming service is most of their revenue. For a stock that had a good run right when the pandemic hit, there was bound to be pullback. 

It's also a bearish sign for tech stocks in general, and we've already started to see a rotation to value. This might be a flashing signal that the tech boom in 2020 is starting to end. I'm still going to hold my AAPL, MSFT, and GOOGL as I think they can weather it out, but if NASDAQ continues to fall this week, we might see the loss of multiple support points. The biggest losers though, will probably be speculative tech stocks, and despite the April green days, ARKK, and a lot of SPACs have barely moved. 

I saw a lot of people on this sub complaining about DIS and how it keeps dropping, hopefully, they get vindicated in the coming weeks because it looks like they've been successfully chipping through NFLX's market share."
2021-04-20 18:44:51,stocks,I sold my shares after last quarter. I think streaming is going to be a race to the bottom from here on out and that isn’t a game I want to be a part of. Too many big media players have chosen to own their own platforms over letting Netflix host them. The golden days of streaming are over.
2021-04-20 19:33:29,stocks,This is presenting a better buying opportunity for Disney imo
2021-04-20 17:18:47,stocks,Would it be advisable to short Netflix tommorrow ?
2021-04-20 17:24:43,stocks,"Definitely not great, but should have been expected. Think they may be sandbagging guidance for buyback, however."
2021-04-20 16:31:30,stocks,"Yeah... It'll be interesting to see the new dynamic.  I own all 3 currently, been with NFLX for as long as I can remember - prob 7+ years.    
Personally, I'm not likely to cancel and resubscribe but there might be general churn between these.  Prime also, although I look at them as just my cost of Amazon and a free perk."
2021-04-20 18:59:54,stocks,"HBOmax interface is such hot garbage.. good content though.

Pretty sure people just keep 1 or 2 streaming services and rotate the others"
2021-04-20 17:16:37,stocks,"Doubtful, new things always attract customers but let's see how amny remain subbed. HBO and Disney have good old content but are awfully slow to release new content and has a very niche audience. There's no surprise Netflix grew with almost 4  million subscribers despite all competition... They'll be fine."
2021-04-20 19:21:49,stocks,"They noted in the earnings report that they don't see competition as the main reason for the miss because they saw a decline in new subscribers in all of their markets, even those without competitors like Disney+ or HBO. They're basically saying they outperformed in new subscribers in 2020 due to covid but had to halt production of new content even though they had money to spend. So now they won't have a lot more new content until mid-late this year. I wonder if we'll see something similar for Disney"
2021-04-20 17:42:12,stocks,"Netflix and the competition are cheap enough for it not to be a zero sum game. There is enough room for multiple streaming services to thrive. Once we start hearing about sub cancellations in large numbers, that's when they should be worried."
2021-04-20 19:12:57,stocks,"I predicted as such. Competition will only get tougher.

My next prediction is that netflix will introduce ads and or tiered sub service to remove them in 10 years"
2021-04-20 17:22:58,stocks,Unless HBO branched outside of the US i don’t think they are much of a competition in comparison to Disney
2021-04-20 16:44:56,stocks,"Yeah.... I guess I'll see what happens tomorrow, but does seem like a big overreaction.  NFLX is just entering the Indian market and has upside.

But by the same token more competition too.

I guess this is just the old 'priced in' growth didn't meet expectations.  Next quarter will be more decisive IMO."
2021-04-20 17:53:46,stocks,"maybe? they were also pretty deeply overvalued, imo more thoroughly than most other stocks on the market

i don't know how much of a problem this is, but netflix has really been struggling to produce lasting, high quality shows. their most popular shows for years were the office and parks & rec but they still never seriously tried to make a long-running sitcom? and now they've got threats on every side, from HBO (comparable lineup imo) Disney (top tier IP and they're getting everything right lately) and now Apple (which might actually have the next well-loved sitcom in Ted Lasso)"
2021-04-20 16:29:36,stocks,">Beats expectations but absolutely murdered.

It's really all about new subscribers.... this is an indication the COVID growth is over."
2021-04-20 17:41:13,stocks,"Netflix's stock thesis is based on subscriber growth instead of financials, unlike legacy media companies."
2021-04-20 16:35:33,stocks,"They literally said don't expect as much growth now that covid is easing out and missed on subs which is a super important number for them

Not sure how that's bullish"
2021-04-20 16:43:36,stocks,Did a price increase happen during this time? That may have helped revenue not being less despite 2 million fewer new subscriptions than expected. I canceled a few months ago. Just wasn't using it enough and couldn't get into any of their exclusives (either zero desire to even attempt watching them or tried and gave up after a couple episodes).
2021-04-20 16:39:17,stocks,"Right on the bell - 4:00 p.m. ET.

Their call will be 6pm I think"
2021-04-20 17:40:17,stocks,"DIS to $250 by this time next year is my bet.  Hoping for big sub numbers from constant Marvel content, reopening of parks and merch and IP.  Disney has quietly amassed an enormous trove of content that they haven’t even begun to release yet."
2021-04-20 16:45:42,stocks,We'll find out then the DIS numbers come out May 13th.
2021-04-20 18:20:18,stocks,"NetflixWorld lol

Fuck it, I’d go"
2021-04-20 16:35:36,stocks,"True.... $216b market cap vs DIS $303b but none of the other segments (nor overhead).  I've never been a NFLX holder but am long DIS.... I think that the COVID growth is done but I still see a future for NFLX... the question is will they outperform the broader market?

(or even their competitors... HBO @ $16 is a lot more than NFLX)"
2021-04-20 17:02:39,stocks,"Yeah, none of us know, ha. If we were just entering this time in 2020, I'd say a definite buy but right now? I expect people will be spending less time binging streaming TV/films and they have more and more choices for that. $480 is a big drop but can't say I'm confident they're going to do better next quarter."
2021-04-20 16:49:03,stocks,"I'm a little lazy to churn, but I can certainly see this happening more given all the options."
2021-04-20 17:15:16,stocks,"What competitor has a better/wider library then Netflix?


Disney is nostalgia and Disney, good for a month but very repetitive. HBO has one good/big series a year at most, watch a season then unsub. Netflix is the kind because it's a jack of all trades, they don't have the killer exclusive but has something for everyone that's good enough."
2021-04-20 17:45:09,stocks,"I think this has a chance of happening with AMZN as well, except the jump to maturity part. I think it's gonna be hard for AMZN to put up the same numbers going forward, let alone improving on them. AWS is either gonna be their savior or anchor. Same with AAPL. GOOG, who knows. Same with FB. Their commodity is people so there will be an endless stream of that, especially factoring in India and other countries getting increasingly wired. If AMZN, NFLX, and AAPL start going bear, the market will get dragged down."
2021-04-20 16:42:43,stocks,"Yep... my thoughts exactly....

There is more competition, HBO Max, DIS, Peacock and the original folks too.  We have the COVID reopening and people back to work (slowly).  I'm thinking it might be a streaming-wide trend.  I only hold DIS and will just buy more if they drop 10% on subscribers."
2021-04-20 16:58:14,stocks,"I believe it will be streaming market wide, following NFLX explanation that this is due to covid pull forward"
2021-04-20 17:27:29,stocks,The time to short it was today.
2021-04-20 17:29:31,stocks,"I dont think so, its fking cheap rn dont burn ur money"
2021-04-20 16:50:04,stocks,"Apparently NFLX churn has dropped compared to last year, despite the recent price increase. They also reported usage per customer is up. So it seems even though subscriber growth is sluggish they are still doing a great job of keeping most of their customers happy."
2021-04-20 17:21:23,stocks,You owned Netflix for 7+ years? Good DD.
2021-04-20 17:01:10,stocks,"I recently canceled prime since most of the stuff has free delivery anyways.

Picked up a large chunk of VIAC today, hopefully flix earnings doesn't further depress the current price."
2021-04-20 17:06:48,stocks,"Prime video sucks overall, though they release some good exclusives once or twice a year (borat 2, knives out, good omens), it's just easy to watch those, then see there's nothing else really worth watching, or that can be found on another streaming service (like star trek), and not bothering with it. But like you said, I have prime anyway so not canceling prime just because I barely watch prime video."
2021-04-20 16:55:26,stocks,"Bought a couple of shares. I really think it's an overreaction. 11% down and still beat most expectations. Netflix has a lot of competition now, but it has a lot of cash and still produces the best content imo. Disney+ has the mandalorian, which is great, but the rest of the content is pretty underwhelming tbh."
2021-04-20 17:59:55,stocks,"Netflix is pretty big in Europe, with the best content by far. Only a few people here use HBO after the GOT fiasco, and Disney plus still has pretty weak content imo. I agree that they were overvalued, but which tech stock isn't?

I think this -11% drop was an overreaction, and soon they will be back at 550. I got some shares today after the huge drop, but I don't plan on holding them for long. I just think it's pretty easy money."
2021-04-20 17:13:49,stocks,"It has to be about new subscribers, as NFLX aren’t diversified into anything else. It could be a while before they lose their market cap, but competitors are definitely starting to chip away at that moat"
2021-04-20 19:13:19,stocks,"I mean, it's not like covid and lockdowns are going to last forever where people will have more time to stay home watching netflix and shit. I think this is an overreaction."
2021-04-20 17:17:54,stocks,"Thanks. Is there a way to find the time a company reports? I looked on the earnings calendar and only see ""Before Market Open"" and ""After Market Close""? Or do they all report Right on the bell?"
2021-04-20 17:07:01,stocks,They’re already above 100m
2021-04-20 17:48:24,stocks,Wtf you said in another comment you have owned NFLX for 7 years? Which is it?
2021-04-20 17:49:57,stocks,"> HBO has one good/big series a year at most

succession, barry, curb your enthusiasm, perry mason, the flight attendant, euphoria, insecure, lovecraft country, i may destroy you

that's just in the past year or so, and some of their key shows (most notably succession rn) have been slowed down because of covid shutdowns. but imo ""one good series a year at most"" is way off base – if i'm picking ""better/wider library than Netflix"" HBO would be my pick (they also have probably the best library of legacy shows like sopranos, the wire, and silicon valley)

I also like apple TV but they're more in the category of 'one or two good series you can sub a month for'. But they're also at D+ level pricing"
2021-04-20 17:35:35,stocks,"You don't need a wider library, just switch your services every few months and you can watch everything. Even free services like Tubi have good content nowadays."
2021-04-20 17:56:32,stocks,HBO by itself maybe but HBOMAX is the first streaming service I’ve had since Netflix started where I feel like it’s worth every single penny
2021-04-20 19:18:56,stocks,"It's more that when you add up Amazon, HBO and Disney+ you have a combined library that far exceeds what's available on Netflix.  And with Netflix getting more expensive while also getting worse, I just don't *need* it anymore."
2021-04-20 19:45:06,stocks,Hard to compare usage between the past year and any other year
2021-04-20 17:46:03,stocks,"""nothing else really worth watching"" isn't fair imo, in recent years they've had marvelous mrs maisel, the boys, the expanse, fleabag and plenty of other quality shows

but yeah, people mostly get prime anyway and streaming is just a bonus"
2021-04-20 17:51:06,stocks,Not sure. I usually see after/before same as you but I stream Bloomberg all day so they’ll usually say as it gets close what time.

Add Zack Snyder's Justice League that came out earlier this month and all the movies too. HBO Max has a huge library and consistently good content whereas Netflix Almost never has a show I like. D+ has star wars and the marvel shows coming out now, but if you don't like those, then it's not really worth it."
2021-04-20 19:37:56,stocks,"Those are all solid but I’m on a three month off one month on relationship with hbo bc of all their superhero movies they’re doing now. Unfortunately Netflix and Disney have a bunch as well, so my only option is to hate everything"

 - A lot of market players needs to show a yearly ROR (e.g. fund managers), so anything that crosses over into 2022+ has a lower relative value. Few EV products are shipping in 2021 and many not even 2022.       
 - When EVs are more successful they'll get bottled-necked by infrastructure, therefore lack of infrastructure remains a source of doubt and while Biden's admin is seeking to fill the void it hasn't passed and the cost remains a major source of contention (both grid infrastructure and actual charge-points).    
 - The cost of batteries, foreign battery manufacturing capacity, trade wars, chip shortage, and reliance on foreign materials (e.g. rare earth metals in some cases) remains a source of doubt.   

Honestly if anything many of the EV opportunities are overpriced rather than under. Look at their history, fundamentals, business plans, or timelines. Most will be gone in five years."
2021-04-20 15:30:04,stocks,"A lot of these shot up with Biden’s win, given the expectation he will push through an infrastructure bill that would favor EV’s. Since that hasn’t yet happened, sentiment has likely fallen off as people are pricing in the odds of such a plan passing through the divided houses of Congress."
2021-04-20 15:28:43,stocks,"EVs just hype right now.  Theyre all getting hammered.  If you can hold through it, hold.  I am"
2021-04-20 16:15:11,stocks,They may never take off so just hold off right now.
2021-04-20 15:47:13,stocks,They were overpriced and now coming back down to reality now. I feel like everyone was jumping on the bandwagon of these new EV companies like the current big car sellers would do nothing and let them take the future vehicle market.
2021-04-20 18:00:33,stocks,"Check out the market cap of the EV companies. TSLA, NIO, RIDE, WKHS, all have much higher caps than GM, F, VLVLY, etc. I think last I looked some had larger caps than the top 10 gas car companies combined. If all the existing car companies just lay down and die, there still won't be a market big enough for them to all be justified. The fact of the matter is that the already established car manufacturers will go hard as fuck at EV, and they already have plants, dealerships, infrastructure, and branding. I don't think any will survive. Maybe TSLA if they keep selling their carbon credits to pad their books."

2021-04-20 15:33:02,stocks,I thought it was because they were heavy debt companies and the fear of potential rising interest rates
2021-04-20 18:09:16,stocks,"You (and I) bought in on the hype. Now it's dying down a bit. I'm not concerned as I plan to hold for years, until the hype becomes reality (e.g. big investment in infrastructure)."

2021-04-20 15:45:01,stocks,"Don't fill like typing a big comment so I'll keep it short. If your looking for a good and cheap stock rn microvision is great they make tech for electric cars and they are about too explode soon. With rumor of a buyout from microsoft also the are being shorted like crazy. Biggest reason to look into it or buy, is that my boi cramer said not to invest which means buy like crazy. Also it's going through a good dip rn."
2021-04-20 16:40:38,stocks,"The only new ones I own and they are only small positions (already have Tesla) are Lucid, MP Materials, and Proterra. Lots of volitility right now in the EV market and tech in general. People are waiting to see if all these new EV related companies can deliver. There's alot of scepticism after what's happened with Nikola, Romeo Power and XL Fleet just to name a few. That's why I personally am holding off on finishing my positions."
2021-04-20 17:33:17,stocks,I like RIDE! Bad PR recently but once the dust settles and orders are filled starting in September i hope the price goes back to $15-20

2021-04-20 15:44:08,stocks,When the market goes down and other people's stocks decline it's a healthy correction.  When your stocks decline it's completely tanking.

2021-04-20 15:34:48,stocks,">What’s the line that differentiates a healthy pullback from crashing hard? 

Whether or not investors hold & how the government responds"
2021-04-20 15:24:24,stocks,"Seriously.  I have tried to diversify, and the markets are at, or near all time highs, but I’ve had months of red.  Maybe I should just stick with ETFs."
2021-04-20 15:26:09,stocks,"I think that line is set by you as much as by the industry. If your due diligence shows that a company still has solid fundamentals and the stock is falling, maybe it's time to buy more.

My glib response is ""whether the fall is steep enough and lasts long enough to reach terminal velocity"" but the real answer comes from you."
2021-04-20 16:29:51,stocks,"My portfolio is within 5% of all time highs, so I am guessing you have overexposure to certain sectors and not enough diversification.  This is a perfect time to reevaluate and question all your positions.

Healthy short term market volatility is in the range of +/- 10% (against the market average), more than that on the downside is called a correction.  average corrections run around 15% but can be worse.

This is where it is important to understand the ""beta"" of your portfolio.  Higher beta stocks go up more than the market average and go down more than the market average.  In a 15% correction a stock with a beta of 2 will go down 30%... do you know the beta on your positions?"
2021-04-20 15:23:51,stocks,About tree fiddy
2021-04-20 18:39:22,stocks,"A correction is 10% down from the all time high a bear market is 20% down from the all time high. Both are healthy and normal in a typical economic cycle. Corrections usually happen every few years.

A crash just so everybody knows and can stop calling every 1% dip a crash is 50% or more down from the all time high.

Edit: Just want to add in here since we're talking semantics the term ""shittanking"" generally just means something going down in value very quickly."

2021-04-20 17:13:00,stocks,"Healthy up to 20% down.
Tanking 70 to 97% down."
2021-04-20 19:27:19,stocks,About 30%. Jk I don’t know but if I’d think a healthy correction is in the 10-15% range and 30% below that is ranking pretty hard.

2021-04-20 16:54:23,stocks,"I can reference the beta on my positions and have done so along with other indicators but that isn’t the sole determinant of my decision making. I appreciate your take on corrections tho and I’m inclined to agree. Given the large market-wide sell off these past few days, I am curious as to what you hold to get you within 5% of all time highs. Paper, uranium, gas, and transport? Lol."

I though rising oil prices would help but no. Shoot I even kinda thought the whole Evergreen fiasco would help (most green energy is domestically produced) but...
2021-04-20 17:30:51,stocks,You missed it
2021-04-20 18:02:20,stocks,Depends on how you define rich. More or less guaranteed 7-10% yearly for life is enough to make life a lot easier. Sure I won't buy a Tesla tomorrow but neither will I be ruined. As for now that 7% yearly (after inflation) is giving me months salary or two by doing nothing and it'll only grow.
2021-04-20 17:57:34,stocks,Tend not to get poor either.
2021-04-20 19:03:03,stocks,This is not true at all.
2021-04-20 19:05:47,stocks,If you invested in SPY at the start of the year you would be up %10. Or %5 in the past month
2021-04-20 19:32:04,stocks,"I don't intend to become rich. I intend to become wealthy.

Too many people think the market is a vehicle for turning a quick profit. Nah. DCA for 30 years into index funds, make those monthly contributions every single time, regardless of bulls or bears, and then come talk to me after 30 years of DCA'ing and compounding interest have done their ""magic"".

Simple as this...I'm not out to become a millionaire this cycle. But I will be a multimillionaire by the time I need to reposition to more secure investments 5-10 years before retirement.

Take the emotion out of investing and stick to the fundamentals. DCA and Compounding gains are wealth management tools. If you are in the market to get rich, good luck. I'm in the market to grow wealth. Too many people think those things are the same thing. They aren't."
2021-04-20 16:57:49,stocks,"If you’re buying shares, why does that scare you? Only call buyers need worry about timing."
2021-04-20 16:29:16,stocks,Well said.
2021-04-20 17:33:17,stocks,"I do have One of those you mentioned... which is Transport sector... up nicely today; I don't do commodities :).  I think Most of this current bump has been counter-sector rotation (where in favor sectors pull back while the broad market keeps kind of moving) and I don't think we will get to a full correction.  Some of what has gotten beaten down will be roadkill relative to the market, some of it will fly again.  Within sectors you can have bits that go in and out of favor and in some cases won't win even if the sector wins, so it's important to look at individual  issues carefully.  Every sector has losers and winners.  I find it a little easier to make broad bets with sector funds for sectors I don't consider myself an expert on."
2021-04-20 18:39:55,stocks,"You can make good stock picks but if you buy them when they are overbought and inflated then your good decision is badly timed. Buying Apple at 140 would have been a bad decision, buying Apple under 120 in March would have been a good decision."

2021-04-20 18:41:44,stocks,"Canadian Solar was at 15, mar 2020. February 21 it was at 60. Now it is 42. It's down 40 percent from its all time high. But it has still tripled in a year. Why has it gone down? The question you should ask is why had it quadrupled in under a year and whether or not that was based on fundamentals. Only companies that make money or have a strong inexorable future can maintain that kind of growth."
2021-04-20 16:59:20,stocks,Because positional liquidity is important to me
2021-04-20 15:55:57,stocks,I’m pretty heavily in EV and green energy and had a GREAT run through 2020 but this last three months have almost erased all my gains. I keep trying to average down on the companies I still believe to have solid fundamentals but every time I think it must be near the bottom it drops even lower. I put a bit more money in today as a last ditch effort to lower cost basis but this is the end of the line for me. Now I sit and wait and hold with my fingers and toes crossed that things turn around.
2021-04-20 15:34:08,stocks,Is your portfolio mainly ETFs?
2021-04-20 19:11:26,stocks,"Yeah the real estate S&P sector was actually up today I believe. I'm guessing ""real estate"" here likely means something like RDFN, and well the explanation there is all of the higher valued Nasdaq stocks have been taken out back and shot, over and over again since mid-February.

When something has been going on for a while (higher beta stocks getting destroyed), then gets paired with the Nasdaq putting up 3 straight really good weeks with a number of 2020 favorites apparently making lower highs at the same time, I'm not sure anybody should really expect a change to happen for the time being."
2021-04-20 17:00:32,stocks,"Ok, but that’s just how you choose to go about it, it fundamentally should not be something that scares the vast majority of investors."
2021-04-20 19:36:46,stocks,"If liquidity is more important to you, then maybe your investing too heavily, affecting your budgeting, or too speculatively... or your budgeting and cash flow allocation is all out of whack where you've somehow attached your rainy day fund to your equities account...idk."
2021-04-20 16:24:17,stocks,"Personally i think they are way overvalued still (depending on the company)

I wish you the best of luck but i would be pretty cautions if i were you. Many of these companies were trading far above their actual worth and some still are IMO."

2021-04-20 17:06:37,stocks,I agree many are. I cashed out the ones I believed we over valued but there are a few I still believe in (just to be clear Tesla isn’t in my portfolio) but they seem to be sliding as a whole.  I’m not super worried because the securities I still hold I am very long on but it’s hard to see such deep red.

2021-04-20 17:13:43,stocks,"Right on.  well hopefully they reverse for you in the near future.

My current account isn't for super long-term (1-2 years ideally) so i tend to keep away from those ones.

Goodluck"

They had a pretty huge runup though recently depending on the company."
2021-04-20 17:21:54,stocks,I did very well with Tesla but got out earlier this month. It seems to continue to defy logic but I decided to take my profits and run.
2021-04-20 15:25:21,stocks,Diversification of your portfolio is key. You have zero control on policy issues.
2021-04-20 16:46:24,stocks,"Over the average 30 year period the world market returns 11.1% annualized.  the worst 30 year period, if you cherry pick the high prior to the great depression to start it, is still 8%.  Invest for the long term.  Real bear markets take an average of 18 months to resolve and the final downturn is usually close to 2/3 of the decline.  there is plenty time to figure it out and try to hedge a bear.  Corrections shouldn't be timed, look like ""V"" and are resolved in 3-5 months.  Ride them out.

Political decisions in the US may mean the US won't lead the next economic cycle.  change the US from overweight to underweight when this cycle ends if you think that is the case."

2021-04-20 15:25:58,stocks,"Just my 2 cents: Stocks are currently overvalued due to the rapid increase in demand over the past 5 months and a lack of investing based off fundamentals and rather word of mouth.

These prices will hold so long as the demand holds, however in the event of any minor dip in the overall market a massive sell off of all the new money will occur, tanking stock prices and forcing investors who wouldn’t have otherwise sold, to sell to avoid their portfolio taking huge losses.

All speculation obviously, but as for when this will happen? If I had to guess, around the time Q4 2021 results are getting reported.

**IMO the best response to this post is pretty deep in this comments thread by Ahrideva. Would highly recommend reading it as I believe it answers the OPs question very well without including any emotional bias.**"
2021-04-20 17:51:18,stocks," ""Now, with all these trillions of dollars injected into our economy and the rising inequality between high and low-income classes along with the diminishing middle-income class, do you think it is a sustainable model for progress and growth?""

Hell yeah! It's time tested. Those of us who have been around more than a few decades have heard this one before - pretty much in each decade since the 80's. And guess what, with a few stumbles and corrections, there is always progress and growth!

The ""shrinking of the middle class"" is as questionable as any definition of ""middle-class"" - of which there are many. Per one (Google search response) definition (from 2020):  ""Pew defines the **middle class** as those earning between two-thirds and double the median household **income**. This Pew classification means that the category of **middle**\-**income** is made up of people making somewhere between $40,500 and $122,000."" I live in a part of the east coast where households making 2X and 3X consider themselves middle-class, and if you look at their standard of living next to somebody making 1/3 as much in middle America, they are pretty much on par.  But the reporters will tell you that those east coasters are part of the growing rich, rising above the shrinking middle-class.

It's media doggerel. Don't let it get you down."

2021-04-20 16:18:49,stocks,"Everything you mentioned is fundamental, my entire argument for a crash is based on it having very little to do with fundamentals.

As you said, there’s tons of new money and new investors, we have yet to see how that money is going to respond to any kind of correction in the market. Considering how irrational the market has been as of recent I think it’s somewhat reckless to say that response is going to be based off solid investing knowledge as previous corrections have been."
2021-04-20 16:06:16,stocks,"I think right now is just a pullback prior to earnings reports in the next 3 weeks, IMO the increased demand from the world reopening will keep the ship sailing through Q3 and when people are out of money from all their delayed vacations (Q4) we’ll see the crash."
2021-04-20 16:04:40,stocks,"Mate if today is the beginning of the end, I’m ready to buy some guacamole dips. But I think that’s not gonna happen lol"
2021-04-20 16:19:37,stocks,"Yes, your argument is based on emotional nonsense. That’s my point. The market hasn’t been “booming for ten years”. We just had a major crash a year ago bud. You must be really, really new lol"
2021-04-20 17:30:34,stocks,"The economy is far behind the stock market and unlikely to recover as fast as many people imagine; certainly not to a level that would justify current valuations. The crash might begin when everyone finally wakes up to that reality.

We will also have to deal with the fact that the green transition will be much longer and a lot more difficult than many people think and that the geopolitical situation will keep getting worse, which will force companies to re-arrange their supply chains away from China. When the pandemic is over people will finally realize that we are not going to step directly into a glorious future but instead have to deal with an era of increased and prolonged challenges before we have a chance of getting there."
2021-04-20 16:52:29,stocks,My guess is as good as anyone else's and I'm with you on the readiness. Let's hope things go well regardless!

There has  never been a crash of that magnitude followed by another crash of equal or greater magnitude inside of 7 years. And only once inside of a decade. If OP’s prediction is accurate, it will literally be the first time in history it’s ever happened."
2021-04-20 16:52:45,stocks,"Can you name a crash that’s been recovered from in the span of 6 months only to continue to soar to new highs? 

I’m not well enough versed on major economic crashes to be able to name one, maybe you are."
2021-04-20 17:07:51,stocks,"I’m not sure if you’re asking in good faith or not. This was the fastest recovery on record, although it’s happened fairly quickly several times before. Not too many drawn out recoveries on the backs of major crashes. The speed of last years recovery makes sense considering the context. Unprecedented injections from the fed, a unique crash environment (covid) that lent itself to big tech growth and a much more expansive and rapidly expanding economy than we’ve had during past crashes. Eventually the chickens the fed hatched will probably come home to roost in some fashion, but almost definitely not within a year"
2021-04-20 17:23:33,stocks,"The March 2020 crash had nothing to do with internal market dynamics but with an external shock (the COVID pandemic) and thus it is more similar to a flash crash with fast recovery.

It is misleading to compare it with a true market crash like 2000 or 2008, both of which were due to internal market issues.

That's why we are back to higher highs than before COVID in such a short period, despite the economy lagging behind the stock market. The true end of the bull market that started in 2009 is yet to come and will happen through a crash that will likely last much longer than what you experienced in March 2020."
2021-04-20 17:27:42,stocks,"Spot on. And I don’t doubt it. But several years out imo. This is what I meant when I said, “a unique crash enviro.”  And the market still had a major crash, no matter which way you cut it. It does not compare to 2008 in terms of severity and broad market damage, but either did the tech bubble. 2008 was also a housing and mortgage crisis"

2021-04-20 17:42:16,stocks,The only problem that I see with this reasoning is that none of the structural issues of the long bull market that started in 2009 was solved during the COVID crash. Instead we just papered things over with stimulus and low interest rates and it's not clear to me how much longer that old bull market can go on.
2021-04-20 17:43:47,stocks,"We will face reckoning at some point, maybe. Or maybe they can kick the can indefinitely so long as there is enough new money entering the markets. Who knows? But it ain’t gonna happen simultaneously with an inevitable and expansive economic recovery"
2021-04-20 17:48:51,stocks,"I am pretty certain that they can't kick the can along indefinitely -- at some point there will be some serious structural issues such as increased inflation or growth in the number of zombie companies etc. so one way or another we'll run into trouble (not only in the US but in the whole developed world).

One of my fears is that the recovery will be slower and more unequal than many people hope. The stock market has priced in the best possible case, but real life is rarely that good. I also fear that we'll wake up after COVID in a geopolitical situation that will end up being worse than anything we've had since the cold war -- if China and Russia keep working together to challenge the US and the West as a whole."
2021-04-20 17:51:59,stocks,"A sad attempt at humor. Of course it can’t go on forever. But I’m highly doubtful it happens before the fed loosens rates and during a period of what I think will be sharp recovery. But you’re right, a significant shift in geopolitics could always sour things. And on a more positive note, I think the recent EV/Growth crash has weeded out a fair amount of dead money companies. Only a few of those affected have really managed any recovery at all, most still bleeding"

Shitty market plus a government that is not interested in privatized prisons does not bode well for this company. even if it's not related to GEO specifically, this stock will dip on federal comments regarding the decrease of privatized prisons.

It doesn't look pretty from a TA standpoint either. fresh off 52-week lows. I'd want to see more consolidation and test/establish support at 5.57 before entering.

2. Trying to beat the market and failing is how we learn. We may never in our lifetimes learn how to beat the market but learning anything over the course of your life is a good thing.

3. This one is counterintuitive, but as with everything else in life, making the most amount of money possible isn’t always the goal. If it were, we’d all be trying to become doctors, lawyers, or investment bankers. Yet we choose to go into careers that interest us. Investing is much the same, there are a lot of factors that impact how we invest that have less to do with returns and more to do with emotion, and that’s fine. Some people invest ethically, some invest in companies that they already support.

That's not to say it's for everyone, but it's also dumb to completely ignore a niche because some (or even most) people can't do it. 95% of successful traders just aren't going to be loud about it because they don't want to give up their edge.

Investing in funds and trading require different mindsets and time commitments. It's not really fair to compare them in my mind. And you're not required to choose one or the other (I do both, but mostly trade.) Trading takes practice and patience and usually requires that you get burned badly a bit early on. I wouldn't be surprised if most failed traders are people who gave up because they didn't get instantly rich in a month, or blew up their accounts going all in on tech stocks at the top or something."

2021-04-20 14:20:47,stocks,"It's very easy for investors to beat the market. Dilution is the number one killer of a portfolio. There are numerous studies that show that for a random group of securities, anything over about 20 will remove individual risk such that your portfolio will regress to the mean. The issue with professional portfolio managers is that they have large enough accounts to warrant holding dozens, if not hundreds of securities. Add to that the unfortunate fact that most advisors have certain obligations to their clients to mitigate risk when possible, preventing them from tilting heavier to a portfolio that could actually beat the market. Throw in some conservative practices like adding bonds, and you're set up for failure. But it's not difficult to beat it if you actually try.

Also, most people on here are very one direction minded and can't get away from hyper volatile positions (namely tech), hoping to 10x in a week. Those strategies usually don't pan out in the long run."

I lost like -30% with tech. Other than that...

So far I think an average gain of around +200% (in 3 months) is most likely beating how the market will perform this year.

2021-04-20 16:04:37,stocks,"First, the transaction costs. For example quite a lot of hedge funds beat the market until you subtract their costs. After costs rarely they beat the market. If a company do not charge you for the transaction then the costs are hidden (read flash boys about hidden costs and danger of sale of transaction information). 

Next are taxes. Until you sell you do not need to pay taxes. So unpaid tax is like interest free loan to you, or even better, as there is no marginal call on taxes. It is not much but Buffet's favorite compounding effect can make it huge deal. 

Finally, hardly it is possible to beat professional traders for a normal person. Not only they have access to very expensive tools and information but, what is more important, they are not risking their own money. Try to play poker on fun and then on money and you will see the difference. Most humans are risk averse and so they will pay to risk neutral person (professional trader) in order to avoid the risk. 

Overall CAPM suggests that one should just understand the amount of risk one can handle and make a mix of risk neutral and equities according to the profile. And the time you save just use to earn money in a way you prefer. Or if you have bullet in brain that blocks human feelings than stock market can be a good choice."

If you and an equally skilled trader matched up in a transaction, it’s luck that’ll determine who won since prices are random. 

If an investor bought a stock or fund on a hunch and it goes up, it doesn’t mean their idea was correct. Likewise, it going down doesn’t mean it was incorrect.

If market returns 18% one year and the 1 stock you all in returns 17%, then you by definition underperformed the market. Not only that, you took stupid amount of risk to get that 17% (single stock risk).

Given enough decades, most people screw up somewhere (and need to lower risk tolerance over time) and it comes out that the average person will just underperform or unable to beat the market.

Cause by definition, the 'market return' long term is just the return of everyone as an aggregate whole long term. And as stock market is not a 50 50 coin game, the top winners take the disproportionate of winnings while everyone else underperforms.

I think before fees and taxes (e.g.: in IRA), like 15% of retail investors long term 'beat the market return' by like 1 or 2% more CAVG in the equity portion.

Everyone wants to get rich quick. Everyone overestimates what they can achieve in a year and underestimate what they can do in 5-10: goes for investing returns too. 9% is for boomers. But 9% per year for decades is a decidedly non-boomer outcome."

Its the first reference that matters. The key is ""professional traders"". That is a very select group. What makes them a professional? Certainly it isn't performance! 
What does it take to be a professional trader?
Mostly, it comes down to what college you went to. 
Next, few are given free reign to trade as they wish. That is the big issue. They MUST follow the plans set forth for the fund. They constantly must rebalance the portfolio based on policy.

In a nutshell, there is much more at play than a trader's ability.

Btw, any article that immediately quotes Buffett is suspect. More than one reference means they are name dropping key words for search engines. This eliminates any credibility at that point. Subjective, yes but I've founds it to hold very true.

An individual can use as much risk as they like.  A professional trader cannot. An individual can get in and out in seconds, a pro may not be allowed to do so. An individual can trade any instrument they can afford.  (And access.) Very not so with many professionals.

Why does the lottery exist? Why do slot machines exist? Why do casinos exist? Some people do it for fun. Most people try it to get rich quick. Everyone thinks they’re special. 


As for day trading I think the number is 85% lose money, 10% break even, 4% make a profit and 1% beat index funds. And 0.00001% of day traders make more than minimum wage. 


It’s hard to gather data on day trading because:


1) People cannot accurately calculate their returns. There was a study done on Brazilian day traders and they found on a survey that 85% of them claimed to beat the market, turns out that number was closer to 3% when they analyzed their trades. 


2) The market doesn’t do the same thing each year. It’s far easier to be profitable when the market goes +42% in a year compared to -30%. This leads to discrepancies in the data just due to the market. This is where the 1% statistic comes from, 1% of day traders are able to predictable make profits every year regardless of market conditions. 


As for investors (there’s a difference). JP Morgan did a study and found the average investor from 1999-2018 had an annual return of 1.9%, while the S&P500 had an annual return of 5%. They believe this is due to investors panic selling during crashes and bear markets causing them to lose time in the market and thus hurting their returns."

I personally believe than the majority of people from the 95% don't take it as serious as they should. No risk management, no strategy, no goal, just throwing around money hoping to figure it out. And the minority of the 95% did have some of those things but still failed maybe from psychological reasons such as they couldn't deal with the loses, didn't follow their strategy and rules good enough. 

I don't even know where the 90-95% number came from and I honestly don't believe the number is that high. I'd like to think the percentage of people who truly gave it their all and still failed is much much lower.

I'd also bet that regular investors are far less likely to fail than day trades."

AMRS is just an outside pick because it's also beaten down and has a phenomenal product roadmap.

2021-04-20 16:29:54,stocks,"To me, buying **profitable** green energy stocks (not smoke and mirror growth stocks) today is about as obvious a pick as buying tech stocks in 2015. Sure, it's reductive to say how easy it would've been to buy X in year Y, but sometimes future growth is quite predictable.

For example, the advent and acceleration of cloud computing in the mid/late 2000s and 2010s wasn't exactly a secret, and anyone who knew the players would have known that AWS, Azure and GCP would be enormous cash cows for their respective parent companies -> buy AMZN, MSFT, GOOG. 

When you look at what companies like ENPH are doing with microinverter tech ie IQ7 and IQ8(d) – the revenue growth on the horizon is, to me, clear as day. We're approaching the ""holy grail"" moment when solar energy generation becomes actually cost-efficient, a requisite of global mass adoption. Combined with the sector being beaten down, it's a good buying opportunity. In short, ""I like the stock"".

Regardless, I certainly don't claim to be some guru. I consider myself a novice. That was what I tried to communicate in my initial post, it was not bragging. Just that if you are thorough in your research and have a plan and stick to it, you very well may outperform the market. I'd say your odds are substantially better than the 5% number that seems to be universally accepted on here.

2021-04-20 15:58:43,stocks,50/50 VFV and VSP for me :)
2021-04-20 13:53:45,stocks,"And HXS.TO has out performed VFV.TO because it reinvests the dividends to avoid withholding tax. 

On a related note, hedged to CAD S&P ETFs have done better in the past year because the USD has tanked. So I expect nonhedged ETFs to lead the pack when the USD improves."
2021-04-20 16:02:59,stocks,"$VFV is  unhedged. $VSP is hedged. 

I personally hold both 50/50. Just to make it more fun to watch at least lol Some days the unhedged has eating up quite a lot the daily gains but as you said it tend to be a great support on red days and overall it's outperforming the hedged for a bit so far."
2021-04-20 13:56:21,stocks,"Thanks for the nice tips.


Didn't know about HXS.TO, very interesting, it does seem to beat VFV."
2021-04-20 13:40:34,stocks,Too many green days? Clearly you're yet to see my portfolio
2021-04-20 13:41:05,stocks,It’s because mid and small cap stocks have been taking a beating and are down 20-50% and aren’t following nasdaq or sp500 performance.
2021-04-20 13:48:12,stocks,"Got to love steel, just hit a 52W high with Arcelormittal however today was brutal for the calls haha, it is what it is.. industry news remains so incredibly bullish with record high commodity prices."

2021-04-20 13:47:07,stocks,"You can't just look at these general market indices and imply that everybody who's still red is just some idiot at investing/trading. It's mostly only been green the past few weeks for those in big tech and consumer plays, and these stocks have a VERY big influence on the overall market indices. Mostly everything else in small- and mid-caps has been trading sideways the past few weeks, only to be more red today.

These ""I told you so"" or ""if you haven't been doing well, you're just bad 🤷‍♂️"" folks literally ONLY come out when the market is red. Stfu. You're just airing your inferiority complexes because you missed a lot of the massive run-ups last year in growth stocks."
2021-04-20 13:47:44,stocks,"There’s a huge number of stocks that aren’t even meme stocks that have been on a decline for the past three weeks. Several big name ones are down considerably:

BABA
JD
SQ
SHOP
TSLA
CRSR
T
ETSY

there are hundreds more. So, while the S&P 500 might be near an all time high, quality stocks are anywhere from 10-25% off their highs. 

Then of course, the meme stocks have been crushed well beyond those percentages. 

That’s what most people are talking about when they say they’ve seen prolonged down days."
2021-04-20 13:47:09,stocks,"Time to go all in, “new ATH” will be a common headline throughout 2021"
2021-04-20 16:57:02,stocks,"Large caps (some) have had a great couple weeks. Mids and smalls less so. People have a right to be frustrated, because even good companies have been getting hammered out and they saw minimal increase since March while this week bleeding even worse.

There are also some large cap sectors that haven’t done well since Feb that didn’t go up much recently and are down bad this week, too.

It’s not like it’s only speculative tech getting beaten up."
2021-04-20 13:51:01,stocks,"I love tech stocks and i like investing in small companies. I agree that small companies not doing so well right now. It's all because people lost their money in february ""bubble"" and now they are afraid to invest and they all put their money on FAANG+Microsoft+ Nvidia to feel safe. 

Maybe when people start doing real investment, not pump and dump then maybe stock market will be good again."
2021-04-20 13:48:02,stocks,Did you buy company stocks that haven't earn any profit yet? If so... then its long term stock.
2021-04-20 13:45:14,stocks,"Came here to say this. Stocks that have been on fire since last March are down big and boomer stocks etc that have been consolidating in that time period are hitting new ATH, 52WH. I keep buying calls on the small mid caps thinking they'll bounce but I'm getting rekt. Now they're about to crash further with indices and boomer stocks."
2021-04-20 14:26:33,stocks,"This is great until you run out of money to average down. ENPH and NIO are those in my boat...

2021-04-20 13:57:02,stocks,"You're right. I should have said from the ATH as opposed to the last three weeks. If people owned those stocks for a while, they're all down considerably from their ATHs, while the S&P 500 is near the ATH."
2021-04-20 13:30:24,stocks,Anything defense related would probably spike.

Putin has said numerous times in interviews that Russia is not and has never been the aggressor in recent decades. “We aren’t the ones setting up military installations all over the world.” The media is there for one reason, to shape your opinion.

2021-04-20 14:32:35,stocks,"Russia invaded and annexed Crimea, they invaded Georgia and continue ops in cheneya. I’m not sitting here saying they are bad guys but they aren’t innocent. Also there are vast differences between training exercises and sending 120k troops to one spot.. that’s a invasion force. If it was a few thousand, he’ll even 30k I could by training exercise. 120k troops, thousands of tanks and artillery pieces. The cost for all the men and material is astronomical and wouldn’t be done for a exercise"

2021-04-20 13:11:50,stocks,"1) nothing, you can do this however a few rules. If you are doing this over the course of one day, it is considered a day trade and restricted to 3 buys/sells over 5 days. If you maintain a balance of over 25 thousand then the 3 trade rule doesn’t apply to you. The other restriction would be buying new stock with money from a sell that hasn’t settled. The settle rule is Trade day plus 2 business days.  If you buy a stock at 9am, sell it at a profit at 2pm and buy another stock with that money, that is not allowed...well it is but if you do it a certain number of times they will block you from doing that for 90 days. But to answer your question, absolutely nothing prevents you and people do it all the time. 

2) sure

3) I would recommend your first 5-10k go into index/mutual funds. They make money slower but much safer. However you can still make hundreds a week if you find good ones. 

If you want to start to identify good stocks and learn which ones to target, watch Jim Cramer. His stocks usually have safe and good returns. Paying for his more in-depth analysis may be worth it. 

Also, try to target stocks that pay a dividend..more free money. But if you’re just starting out, please play with a safe amount. For learning the ropes, definitely play with index funds first"
2021-04-20 14:28:43,stocks,"1. What is a small amount to you? Does it cover commission? There’s always fluctuation, but nothing is guaranteed. Try it yourself in paper trade.

2. Again, price fluctuates, and what is a small amount to you? Basically it’s day trading with stop limits, some people make money, some don’t. I personally don’t advise it.

3. Most common stocks are ones with massive capitalization like AAPL AMZN.

4. By “already massive stock” and Tesla, you probably mean hype, so the stock is likely overvalued. Lots of people made money from dogecoin, doesn’t change the fact it is overvalued garbage.

5. Company financials

6. Volume"
2021-04-20 14:44:51,stocks,"Sounds like you want to trade and not invest to me.  Do not overlook that difference.  In my opinion investing is looking at the fundamentals of a company and searching for great undervalued companies that you buy and hold for the long term and possibly collect the dividends or bank on the growth (or both). You should look into swing trading and technical analysis from some of tour questions.  Get a low commish broker and start small, use position sizing to mitigate risk and start dabbling."

2021-04-20 16:46:35,stocks,Alibaba has rock-solid financials and growth year after year. It is one of the most financially secure companies out there right now with a great growth plan. People always get scared when discounts arrive and then complain that they always miss the boat. If you zoom out you can see nearly every enormous tech/ecommerce stock has had bad years so this and these are often due to government regulatory fears. This is nothing unusual

2021-04-20 16:32:22,stocks,"> under the pretext that they shouldn't have gone for hyped, or meme, stocks

I see all these posts from people who have portfolios that looks like they searched 'DD' on /r/wallstreetbets, and bought those companies with no idea what those companies did, if they were profitable, or what their financial situation is. When those people FOMO buy stocks that have gained 20+% in a month, I feel like they probably should have, like, read a basic investing 101 FAQ. And, then, when they sell for a huge loss like a month later, and decide that stocks are a scam, I mean, what did you expect. You treated investing like lotto ticket and lost. Shocker. 

> to justify the decline that's been happening for 3 months

What 3 month decline? VTI is up like 5.5% in the last 3 months. SPY is up like 7.5%. 

> because clearly they know more than the rest by doing so

That is the whole point. I don't know better than anyone else. I am not a professional investment strategist. I do know, as a whole, the market goes up over time. The market will pick the winners, and the market will kill off the losers.

> most are down and have been going down for months now

You mean, most people that get their stocks tips from a message board, don't do any research, and buy because the fear missing gains are down? Another shocking statistic. 

> and some random dude on Reddit won't know more than the other as to what is happening

Again, this is the point. Random people on reddit don't know anything special (unless you are DFV). If you are making your picks based off reddit 'DD', and you lose money, hopefully your stock market tuition was cheap, and you have learned from your mistakes."

- the peak and initial drop was in 2007

- the market bottomed in 2009

- buying the peak in 2007 needed 14 years to recover on an average basis

- some companies recovered faster than others

- a lot of companies never recovered

Needless to say, within this context certain reddit meme sentences would be very difficult to properly execute:

- buy low: 2 years of constant trend downward, never knowing when the bottom finally hits

- keep buying every month: watching every buy lose value every time you buy for 2 years

- just buy VTI/index funds: those kept going down while some companies like microsoft recovered handily 

- just buy and keep long: day trading and shorts would've made a lot of money in that two year hell/bear-ish market, while the longs would've stayed in the red a long time.

I'm not saying I disagree, I'm just saying it's a lot more difficult to apply standard good advice than the little book of common sense investing would assume.

2021-04-20 13:44:18,stocks,"Hello u/DarknessOverLight112,
The question you asked is something a lot of people have and it’s unfortunate that popular media or information readily available makes you “feel” like you’re missing out on growing your portfolio because you’re not invested more into Growth stocks and ETFs.
I’m sure you will get plenty of “advice” from people here, or on social media or you might read articles that “tell”you to buy this stock or that ETF “before” the next run-up/ rally..
Lol this is how this industry makes money. Makes everyone feel like they should act immediately or they will miss out. The unfortunate reality is that “Investing in the stock market” and building wealth from it is only something that can be taught through experience. It is a painfully slow time consuming process that cannot rushed whatsoever. 

Maybe a couple of years from you, you could reflect back to this day when you posted this question and go through all the replies you received and you might actually act on something you heard or read from here. When you reflect back to this day, hopefully you will remember that some stranger in the Internet wasted your time because he didn’t give you a tip on the next “hottest growth stock or ETF”, but he encouraged you to study (actually study) about successful investors like Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, John C. Bogle, Benjamin Graham, and others....

Eventually, you’ll learn about this undeniable statistic of the stock market called “Reversion to the mean” (lmao yes one of those boring statistics formula you had to memorize in high school or college to pass that even more boring class).

I wish you the very best on your investment journey and I sincerely do hope you make less mistakes on your way to greatness so you can keep most of the wealth you earned.
Good luck! 🙋🏾‍♂️🚀🚀🌝"

I do recommend ARKF. I know this is controversial, but I love most of their holdings. I believe that Cathie Wood is not afraid to invest in the next biggest thing. Check it out. 

The potential downfalls has to be the liquidity of the small caps she invests in. Due to balancing, her selling will move stocks. So, the upside is huge, but the downside is also huge. However, I would buy the fund at this price, and I think that this is a great 5-10 year hold."

Nothing wrong with dividend stocks, especially Large Cap, and if they are in any of the mentioned sectors, and/or they are still kind of growthy... i.e. their div payouts are pretty low... MSFT is a great example.
I thought I had a good idea with high dividend stocks (maybe similarly to you) about 25 years ago and found out the hard way that they didn't keep up and had their own risks.
and yes there are Schwab or Fidelity funds you could build the same portfolio out of, but no reason to double down on the same sectors with just a different fund family unless you have different accounts that only have access to one or the other.

I also do not like to see such an enormous stock based compensation program which rewards every single realtor in stock bonuses. The numbers are amazing but MLM and massive share compensation are red flags that will absolutely factor in the long term with dilution and profitability.

I don't care what the price is on any given day, month, or hell...even year. What I care about is how many shares I was able to buy over 30 years of consistent and ""unemotional"" investing."
2021-04-20 12:21:20,stocks,I thought there was support in the 30s I was clearly wrong. I’m not sure this will recover quick enough. I regret not selling in the 30s. If it gets back in the 30s again I’ll start selling. After seeing everyone’s comments it seems I’m better off cutting my losses and putting the money else where
2021-04-20 12:26:56,stocks,Yup. I’ve kind of accepted it. After seeing everyone’s comments I’m going to sell the second it hits the 30s
2021-04-20 12:21:43,stocks,Lol for how long. I don’t believe in this enough to hold for 2 years
2021-04-20 15:30:57,stocks,"Why not take back some of the investment if it bounces back to 30? I mean, you have about $6K on the table. Take out 60%, and this way you can both diversify away from it (and lower the opportunity cost), while still hold a sufficient amount in case it rises in the long term.

Selling it all at once *after* a rebound is mostly irrational.

Edit: noticed.now that you averaged 45. All the more reason not to fully chicken out when it rebounds."
2021-04-20 12:37:54,stocks,"If you don't believe then cut your losses and lose more money chasing hype somewhere else. By the time you've sold for a loss and chased value at all time highs, growth might be booming."

Now, I am no expert in the pharma world (breaking Lynch's #1 rule: know what you own), plus I have only been investing for 2 years (mainly in index funds), but to me GSK seems really attractive. They have:

* a really great EPS growth
* the dividend payout ratio has dropped dramatically over the last 3 years (though questions of dividend safety are possible)
* Looking at their balance sheet, they haven't sold any assets
* Long term debt is of concern, but total debt is being paid down (rates?)

I’d check the list of upcoming phase 2 and 3 in GSK and also look at the blockbuster drugs they have to see if the future looks bright. I’m guessing if they are “undervalued” compared to other pharmas, you’ll see the answer there.

You’ll also probably see some effect of the Covid vaccine stock craze too. GSK isn’t really successful there, although I don’t think that really matters in the long run."

2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,"How Easy is it to use the Fama French Model in Investing? I've been investing mostly in picking some stocks and ETFs(VTI, EFA, ONEQ). I have stumbled on Common Sense Investing somewhat recently and most times, he's talked about using the Fama French 3 or 5 factor model in investing. The factors are: Value over Growth, Small over Large, High over low profitability, Conservative over aggressive firms, and Investment. 
In his video, Ben Felix seems to promote an allocation of 6 ETFs(XIC 30%, VUN 30%, AVUV 10%, Xef 16%, ADVD 6%, XEC 8%), but says that it captures the Fama French model in a broad sense. Is there a better method that requires more work, but a reasonable amount(I don't have all day to research and trade)?"
2021-04-20 11:32:04,stocks,"Not really, the basis of Fama French is that you have to diversify away all non-systemic risk. That means that doing research on individual companies is pretty much pointless since you'll have to end up with something similar to those index funds in the end, might as well just buy the index funds.

If you were to target a specific, or some complementary group of risk factors (small and value for example) you could do a bit more research and maybe do ok but there are index funds for those as well that will probably do better. FISVX for small and value for example"
2021-04-20 11:38:05,stocks,"The Fama French model was developed during the age where anti-trust actually was put into use, and before the age of consolidated tech monopolies. 

My hypothesis is that it doesn’t work in the markets we currently have.  Thus you see risk adjusted outperformance by the biggest market cap firms in the planet (FAANGM + Tesla) compared to small caps."
2021-04-20 11:35:24,stocks,"So, in the end, the market itself is what removes most of that risk?"
2021-04-20 11:40:53,stocks,This might be true but the current underperformance of Fama French models is well within the expected amount for the time period which it has occurred. The recent outperformance of large cap growth stocks neither proves nor disproves the fama french models.
2021-04-20 11:51:26,stocks,"Would you see it occurring in either more developed economies(like Japan &  Germany). For instance, EWJ(iShares Japan) has had bull and bear markets, but has gained 10% since March 1996, albeit at a peak in 1996. In flatter markets, would small-caps be better then?

Or would emerging economies(India or Mexico) be a better choice to look for certain subsections of the market?"
2021-04-20 11:37:08,stocks,"Yes, it is the countless acts of tiny arbitrage that takes place in the market on a daily basis that removes non-systemic risk from a properly diversified portfolio."

2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Lumber Industry DD First DD so give me your patience.

Housing is fucking nuts in the past year as people move out of the cities and into suburbs across America and the world. This has led to great plays like UWMC or RKT, which have had their time and I would still argue are undervalued but that's not the point right now. 

As the housing demand went so high, each industry involved in housing shot up; mortgages are the most recent example, with RKT doubling in a week and UWMC seeing a 40% week earlier this march. Homebuilders like [TOL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TOL/) and [LEN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LEN/) have also seen enormous runups. These all make sense because houses are expensive and the volume moving on the market is obscene. The next logical step is not far from what the vitards pulled off with the steel plays like $MT: directing your attention at the most base material for all this shit.

**Stocks in question**

The stocks in mind are UFP Industries ($UFPI), a Michigan based wood and wood alternative producer, and Louisiana Pacific (LPX), a Tennessee based lumber product producer. I picked these two because they've both got solid results over the past year, are substantial companies, and have earnings coming as soon as tomorrow after close for UFPI. Their products go into American houses at every step, from the main beams to the siding, [and lumber has only gotten more expensive in the past year.](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/lumber)

Lumber futures also signal that this will continue for a while: 

>Even the May 2022 contract, a full year out the curve from the current spot month, is priced at “only” a 25 percent discount. None of this is good news for builders or other professional buyers of nearly all grades of lumber, because they’ve got to have lumber to build, and the building season is hitting full stride as the calendar advances. These folks are paying up because they have no alternative, and there is no indication this trend will end anytime soon. The pros who use lumber will continue to buy what they need, if they can get it, even at elevated price levels.

^https://www.forbes.com/sites/salgilbertie/2021/04/17/lumber-prices-rocket-higher-as-demand-overwhelms-supply/?sh=2a2fe3cf21f9

The futures price of lumber regardless, there is a lumber shortage and those who stand to gain the most are those who produce it. Homebuilders too may suffer

> American Homes 4 Rent, which built more than 1,600 rentals last year and plans to construct another 2,000 houses this year, said its lumber bill is between $20,000 and $25,000 per house, up from about $10,000.

^https://www.wsj.com/articles/commodities-boom-hits-home-11615973404

Another nice thing is that LPX and UFPI have a p/e ratio of ~15 and ~20 respectively, so you're not buying into some overpriced trash shit even in this market of nutty valuations.

**Short Interest**

Don't ask me about the fucking short interest

**Positions to capitalize**

UFPI posts its Q1 2021 earnings tomorrow. Whereas lumber futures traded from 550-660 for most of Q4 '20, they rocketed up at the end of december and have traded between 668 at a low to nearly 1000 by the end of the quarter. For this reason, I believe that a strong earnings beat is very likely for UFPI, and calls would be great but the fact that they are only available for May 21 kind of is a a ball buster. I'm buying calls only but that's because I am poor

For LPX, they have earnings in May, but its not unreasonable to treat them the same. It is best to save the trouble of theta decay and wait to buy calls, but if UFPI smashes earnings then LPX may go up in expectations of a similar earnings beat as they have significant crossover in their products. 

**personal positions**

1 UFPI share, 1 UFPI 5/21 $80C, 1 LPX 5/21 $70C

2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,Naked shorting What advice do folks have around investing in growth stock that seem to have a lot of shorting? It seems these days that naked shorting in bio-tech specially has a tremendous amount of shorting. It’s frustrating to see some great companies with good tech and management become victims of Wall Street. I’m wondering if there are certain characteristics in a company to look for before investing to protect my capital. Thoughts? Strategies?
2021-04-20 11:39:23,stocks,"Everyone trading or investing in a given stock has opinions on its future performance. With a lot of those biotech companies, they will never have a viable product and their stock will go to zero. Accordingly, some traders take those naked short positions if they see no future for the company or its product(s). 

My only advice would be to risk only what you can afford to lose in a gambling trade like that. If you know that you wouldn’t miss the money if the stock drops 50% (which routinely happens on small biotech companies), then go ahead and trade those. But if you want to protect your capital, invest in companies with a proven track record of revenues and profits. And ignore shorting, it is a very inconsistent indicator of future performance."
2021-04-20 15:28:57,stocks,"Shorting doesn’t have a negative effect on the share price of a stock. 

My assumption as to why they’d be doing this is that most biotech IPOs fail and are delisted so if you cast a wide net shorting this sector, then you’re likely to make money.

How they handle collateralizing these positions, I do not know if they are in fact uncovered as you’re suggesting.  

If you’re looking to own stock in some of these companies, I’m unclear as to why this would be of any consequence to you or to your position. I might not be misunderstanding the question."

Why should I be paying maintenance fees to not have the managers of the ETF do their job and drop losing holdings? I held a $31 average on this thing, and I honestly don't see it getting anywhere near there for the next couple years. I bought during the hype of Bidens presidency but now that that has died down, reality has kicked in. Green energy is still many years off in the future. What are your thoughts on this etf?"

A tiny, economically insignificant country like New Zealand makes up 8% of holdings. These are companies that only generate power and granted they also operate in Australia but mind you, NZ and Aus have a combined population below Canada's and Canada has another 8% of this ETF's holdings. Germany is 2%?! the UK - a global leader in clean energy - is only another 3%.

What's missing is a country like Japan with some behemoth battery manufacturers like Panasonic and NGK. Sure, ""clean"" isn't a buzzword in those companies' sectors but they are vital players in the sector.

It's a confusing story with companies like Plug and Ballard power. Hydrogen? Fuel cells? the EV market is exploding and these companies are harping on about tech with a questionable future at best.

The problem is that many clean energy companies are not publicly traded which is why this index is so lopsided.

As you notice they are referencing “underlying index”. So whatever changes they made (reduction of Plug, etc) - that’s due to the index making changes. 

This is similar to the dividend ETF I love, SCHD. People love it and keep talking about how amazing fund management is. No... it just tracks a well-designed index."

Here’s the thing: the big sell off in tech started as the 10 year yield rose sharply... but now that the 10 year is dropping those stocks aren’t rebounding — they’re selling off even more.  Then there’s the pandemic; things getting better, economy is going to overheat... sell off. Oh, wait, cases are on the rise again... sell off. 

EVERYTHING is now a reason to sell!  I’m losing my shit here... this makes no sense. I think my stocks are good but it’s frustrating that after selling off hard they aren’t recovering. I want 2020 back."

2021-04-20 12:37:05,stocks,"Look up on google trends for “ARKK” and “ICLN.” Their number of searches almost tracks their share price. When you buy off hype, expect the hype to die off. 


If I’m not mistaken, this is called narrative driven economics. This term was coined by Robert Shiller (the guy who made the Shiller PE Ratio) and he defines it as 


> “By narrative economics I mean the study of the spread and dynamics of popular narratives, the stories, particularly those of human interest and emotion, and how these change through time, to understand economic fluctuations.”


I might not be representing his theory correctly, but I’d assume we can draw a similarity between the narrative of “saving the world from climate change” with ICLN, and the narrative of “investing in the future of humanity” with ARKK. You can’t deny these two funds have a narrative around them that drives investment into them.


Edit: Same with TSLA. There’s a huge narrative around that company. So much so people often cite the narrative as their DD, rather than basing their decisions off fundamentals of investing."
2021-04-20 12:48:40,stocks,""" I felt like this was a good approach, taking on tech, energy, data/security and transport ""

That's your problem. You took on tech, clean energy, data/security and transport (presumably EV's and autonomous driving??). Just like everyone else. It seemed like a sure thing, so everyone was flocking in. Not only retail investors but big investors as well. In the past year or two, we have seen so many new companies in these industries, so a lot of people, with a lot of money, thought this was a sure thing as well, so you are in no way alone.

It's not that you are wrong (or at least I don't think so) in saying that these industries are going to shape the future. Where you went wrong was when you assumed that would also mean large short-term returns for investors.

The problem with hot industries is that everyone wants their slice of the cake, and the cake is only so large. So the slices become very small. Sure the few companies that do make it could dominate the space 20 years from now, but twenty years is not two months. That's another mistake you make, you worry too much about short-term price fluctuations. Another problem is that very few people, if any at all, could pick the google out of the 15 or so large search engines that were around 20 years ago. You might think ""that's why I have the ETF"" but that's another mistake. You think having a diverse portfolio of stocks in a tailwind sector is going to secure your returns. It won't. The problem goes back to the finite cake where everyone gets only a small slice, at least to begin with. Until winners start to emerge, which could take several years, you are going to see lots of competition and low margins across the whole industry.

The last obvious mistake was that you paid way too much. Price matters, price matters a lot. Think about it this way. When you go out to eat with your significant other, do you always go to the highest-rated, most expensive Michelin restaurant you can find, because you absolutely want the best no matter what? Or do you go for a much cheaper, but still excellent local restaurant? I would definitely go the much cheaper, but still excellent place, even if it's not the best thing I could possibly get. It's the same with a company. Every aspect of a company can be better than another, but if the price is too high you won't make money, or at least not very much of it. I'm not saying buy shitty but cheap companies, but I am saying you should buy great businesses at fair prices, or decent businesses at great prices.

Peter Lynch once said that ""if something seems like a sure thing, it's usually a good time to sell"". Because people always bid ""the next big thing"" up way too high, which means it's eventually comes back down to something more reasonable, especially if the space becomes overcrowded, which it often does."

Around 20% in Baillie Gifford SMT (high growth fund) and 5% in Fubo cause, why not? 
Fubo is taking a beating but the rest are just fine. Why? Because they all make cash dollar. Interest rates go up? Who cares Microsoft and the like have billions to play with. Past performance isn’t indicative of future returns. However, having a fat balance sheet helps. High interest rates? Who cares. 
Also, if you have half a brain you know that through some mechanism or another these companies will continue to grow. A world without Amazon, Microsoft or Google? Not happening."

2021-04-20 12:11:11,stocks,What did you see that made you sell?
2021-04-20 11:14:42,stocks,Me too. Now I am just waiting for the crash to be able to join again.
2021-04-20 11:30:16,stocks,Last February? Not bad! I sold my whole portfolio just before the corona crash (really lucky) and have been building it up ever since.
2021-04-20 13:30:39,stocks,😇
2021-04-20 16:11:44,stocks,"The graph of the market for the last 100 years means little, to nothing, in terms of what they market will do in the next 6 months or 1 year.

Sure, maybe it all goes tits up next week, and you look like a genius buying that dip. On the other hand, maybe the market rallies for the next 6 months and you miss out on a 10% gain. And, then, maybe it dips after that, and you buy in, and then it falls even more!

Bottom-line is, if you are trying to time the market, you are going to have a bad time. If you are listening to the 'tone' of the talking heads on TV to gauge the upcoming performance of the market, you then, apparently, believe the talking heads can predict the market. If they could do this, they wouldn't be talking on TV, they'd be chillin' on the beach with their millions of dollars.

TL;DR: Don't attempt market timing. You can't do it. I can't do it. The talking heads on TV certainly can't either."

My inexperience heightened my losses than what they would have been if I had have just held out with my big tech stocks (to some degree at least).

I admittedly went into very high risk stocks too at some points, so I can only blame 'the market' to a point."

Pick broadly diversified, market tracking, funds like VTI, VT, VOO, SPY. Sure, you'll 'only' get market returns, but that is far better than hemorrhaging money after getting your stocks picks off reddit."

2021-04-20 11:59:26,stocks,Love how you're getting mass downvoted for pointing out the obvious. What's going on?
2021-04-20 12:05:29,stocks,"Damn the downvotes when you are right.

There are 2 mistakes people here make, buying things they heard from reddit and another one is buy in price. 

People buy and are hyped for everything that is at its peak price way too overvalued, when it comes down to reality so does their portfolio and it reflects their trading/investing skills.

I bought tons of things reddit hypes up at some point, never when they are hyped up but when the dip comes. And all my portfolio is pretty sideways with exception of Nvidia rallying my entire portfolio up."
2021-04-20 13:07:07,stocks,Not been a bad method for me so far lol
2021-04-20 12:21:05,stocks,"I looked down, and my hands were made of paper. 

No - really I hadn’t lost anything (of my initial investment) and was kind of fatigued by the whole thing. I just needed to not care for awhile. 

I have retirement accounts so playing the stock market was just a good time passer for me at the height of covid."
2021-04-20 11:16:15,stocks,"Yup. I lost most my profits on ICLN. 

Ended up walking away up about $350. I was sick of checking the app, honestly.

Edit: disclaimer I’m not smart."
2021-04-20 12:46:47,stocks,"Yep, I've got about 80% in (and will keep in) with about 20% sitting in cash as we speak and that's my dry powder. I'm a huge proponent of DCA, through thick and thin, so I'm not about to start selling, trying to time the market. I'm gonna do what's sensible and keep my money invested and add to it during red weeks/months/years. Red shouldn't be scary...you do need dry powder ready, but it's the buys now that make you money in the future. Riding the massive green of 2020 had to end. Now is not the time to ""pull out"". Now is the time to get more shares: DCA doesn't care about the price at any given moment. It cares about how many shares you've bought after 30 years of consistent buying, through thick and thin. I make monthly contributions (DCA), but I also have dry powder available to slightly increase contributions during red months/years.

My accounts have soared in 2020, but it's electronic money. It isn't real until I take it out and buy something with it. Which I don't plan on doing for 20-30 years. As someone who saw 2008 and how it hit my parent's accounts, I would say I'm ""battle-heartened"" through mitosis. I know what bad looks like, but I also know that selling in red is fundamentally flawed. If you have the runway to continue to DCA through months or years of red, then you've got nothing to fear. In fact it is an opportunity to strengthen your positions further and once the next bull hits...that could be the final one you ""needed"" to retire early. Buy when it's red. Buy when it's green. The important thing is you are buying consistently and you aren't selling positions in dramatic fashion. If you have the runway to wait it out, then look at this (and any sort of pullback or correction...or crash...) as an opportunity to embolden your positions (which I hope aren't on speculative stocks). This is the time to play it safe, but to double down on your DCA theory and enjoy the sale (however long it lasts...could be years). All that matters is that you have more shares at the end of this than when you began. Because then the next bull that hits will compound even more. 

That's how you build wealth. By going through cycles and not let emotions drive your decisions."
2021-04-20 12:10:51,stocks,When did you buy back?
2021-04-20 12:37:15,stocks,"Wait, just before Corona? So 2020? Dude, that's just before it skyrocketed! That's pretty unlucky."
2021-04-20 16:28:45,stocks,"I hear everything you're saying, I get it all, I have literally explained that you can't time the market to other people. That if you missed out on only the 10 best trading days of the last 20 years you would have lost nearly all of your gains. I get it.

I'm not going to get into all of the specifics as to why I believe that a 50% or more market wide crash is imminent, because no one wants to hear it and no one ever believes it, because there are always crashes and timing the market, broken clock blah blah blah I get it.

BUT when I truly believe that a 2008 level crash is nearly upon us, why wouldn't I take profits and get cash ready? And at least try to warn people? I know they arent going to listen, but I'm still going to try lol"
2021-04-20 13:34:00,stocks,"Yes me too I lost a big chunk of profits with the correction, but that was my fault for getting to greedy. When I hit 100% profits, I take 50% gains. Well, I should have but didnt lol."
2021-04-20 19:24:07,stocks,"Understood. You are still in the gambling stage of your investment life cycle. It’s natural to start this way. I started that way too. Luckily, I didn’t have much to lose at that time. Hopefully you reach a point where you are managing a 6-7 figure portfolio and have shed this need for excitement because at that point, it will be cheaper to do drugs and hire hookers than continue what you are doing now.

2021-04-20 16:41:55,stocks,"The thing is, even if you correctly predict this upcoming market crash, you are probably still better off just being invested in highly diversified funds. Because, you won't time the top correctly to liquidate into cash, and you won't time the bottom correctly either. 

I agree, the some parts of the economy look pretty shaky. On the other hand, the people on the upside of the K shaped recovery are in better financial shape than ever. Just personally, I have saved more money than I ever have before in my life, refinanced my mortgage at 2.625%, and watched our retirement account boom over the last year.

I just think there are way, way too many factors and unknowns to attempt large scale market timing. It just can't be done. You have to be correct on direction AND timing, and that is basically impossible to do with any consistency."
2021-04-20 13:39:12,stocks,Haha some people here talking about 7% gains are good and you're talking 100% hahaha. No but jokes aside that's a smart thing to do especially with more riskier stocks that give these high returns

2021-04-20 14:48:51,stocks,Honestly bro. Use your own judgement. I bought up a load of NIO when it was 4$ a share and let all the haters on Reddit convince me to sell at 10$.
2021-04-20 14:42:16,stocks,"The EV sector grew unreasonably in 2020 due to FOMO brewing from Tesla's fantastic year. At the heart of NIO's operations is a good idea, but the stock has priced in the sale of millions of cars.  
  
In addition, every car they produce and sell--they sell at a loss. So for Fiscal 2020, NIO had revenues of $780 million with costs to achieve such a figure of over $800 million. This tells us that each car's cost to produce is greater than their selling price. This loss is before any overhead such as SG&A nor R&D.  
  
I personally believe NIO's FV is closer to $20-25 per share (Market cap of $25-30 billion)  
   
Should NIO be worth $15 billion more than Ford? I don't see it personally and I believe Ford is better positioned to be the affordable EV maker in the future."

2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,"The potential bear cases for uranium and subsequent counter arguments When considering what things to invest in or not invest in, one has to consider in what way they can be wrong, rather than just focus on how they can be right. This makes sure that you are aware of the downside risk should one or two things go against you and derail the initial investment thesis. I have covered uranium on Reddit for almost a year now and addressed numerous of these bear cases, while simultaneously looking for one myself as well. Because I realize going back through all my posts and reading hundreds of comments is a course of action that few if any of you, understandably, have time for, I wanted to share with you a recent write up provided by John Quaks (quakes99 on Twitter). After talking to John, he was fine with it being shared on here as well in order to provide value to more people. He lays out the potential bear cases in a well written sense and it embodies everything (and more) of the things that I have discussed on here as well. Now, onto the write up:

The bull case for Uranium seems as rock solid as they come for any commodity. Years of  
 underinvestment and low uranium prices have led to long term mine suspensions that have pushed  
 mined supply to a 12-year low while global nuclear capacity has risen every year for the past 8 years to push uranium demand back to pre-Fukushima levels once again. Analysts now predict that uranium will be in a sustained multi-year supply deficit made worse by depletion of existing mines and continuing delays in building the new mines needed to bring supply back into balance with demand.

 Idled mines need signed contracts closer to US$50/lb before they can commit to raising capital and  
 hiring new mine workers needed to bring their long-dormant mines safely back into production. Mine restarts are costly and it can take a few years to cycle back up to nameplate capacity, and on their own are insufficient to bring mined supply back high enough to meet rising demand.  
 Decisions to bring new mines into production are even more daunting with requirements for new capital investment of US$5 Billion plus to develop, permit, and build enough new mines and processing facilities to replace mined capacity set to close over the next decade and fill the estimated over 100 Million pounds per year mined supply deficit projected for 2035 based on a modest nuclear capacity growth rate of 1.5% per annum.

 In order for shareholders, Boards and lenders to give a new mine a construction ""green light there will need to be signed offtakes and long term contracts in the US$60+ range before committing to spending billions of dollars and hiring and training thousands of new mine workers. Even after construction go-aheads are given it will still take several years for new mines and mills to be built and eventually achieve their production targets.

 With uranium prices hovering around $30 per pound today, assuming a conservative nuclear growth  
 model, at least a doubling of U308 prices will be needed to bring idled mines back into operating and  
 incentivize enough new mines to begin construction and achieve their production capacity by the end of the decade. TradeTech has stated that they believe that 80 to 90 percent of all the uranium mine projects that exist today must be brought into production to meet future demand, many of which require uranium prices higher than $60/1b. Given the permitting political and funding challenges that all mine projects must face, only a small number of projects identified today will likely be successful in being constructed and achieving their projected production goals.

 Cameco CEO Tim Gitzel summed it up by saying that the world needs to discover, develop, and  
 commission about 6 McArthur Rivers or Cigar Lakes in the next 15 years. That's new production of 108 Million pounds per year by 2035. The chances of that happening are slim to none even if uranium prices spike well beyond $60/1b to $100 or even $200 or more. No matter the price of uranium, there must be mine construction approvals, political support and certainty, billions of dollars in necessary investment many years to build mines and mills, hire and train mine workers as well as the inevitable unanticipated setbacks and delays which seem to plaque new mine construction Taken together, this is the rock solid bull case for uranium over the next decade or more. It doesn't even take into account the impact of an emerging global embracing of nuclear power to decarbonize economies to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions in the fight against Climate Change. A new global Nuclear Renaissance to satisfy the baseload carbon free energy required to electrify everything would make it all but impossible for mined uranium supply to ever catch up with rapidly growing demand added by the mass deployment of factory built advanced Generation I reactors small and micro modular reactors. A massive effort towards recycling of spent fuel to create a fully dosed fuel cycle would be needed to find the technological solutions to overcome the constraints on uranium supply.

 The bull case is clear to see, but what about the bear case? What if anything, might there be that  
 could derail the inevitability of the uranium bull market? As uranium is a cyclical commodity that goes through boom and bust cycles based on changes to supply and/or demand, we can approach the question by looking at both side of the equation separately. On the nuclear demand side, the obvious potential show-stopper for the uranium bull market would be another major nuclear incident. However, whether such an event derails or instead temporarily delays the bull market boom cycle is another question. With 444 nuclear reactors in operation and another 54 already funded and under construction, a nuclear accident would have to be significant enough to lead  
 to the shutting down of dozens of operating reactors and suspension or cancellation of many new  
 reactor builds in order to put an end to a uranium bull market. Mined supply is in such a deep deficit  
 that in the order of 70 currently operating reactors would need to be permanently shut down to match the estimated 35 Million pounds per year sustained supply deficit so as to prevent a further rise in uranium prices.

 Looking back at Fukushima, one has to keep in mind that it was the shutdown of Japan's 54 reactors, and decisions by Germany and some other nations to follow suit that derailed the nuclear renaissance that was underway back in 2011. It wasn't simply sentiment towards nuclear but a real change to uranium demand that sent U308 into an oversupply situation that drove down prices and led to shutting down mines and shelving mine development projects. A minor nuclear accident lacking in catastrophic outcomes would not likely be sufficient to change the trajectory of uranium prices today. Since Fukushima, billions of dollars have been invested by Japan and other western nations to undertake engineering studies, upgrade reactors and improve safety and security, so the likelihood of a major catastrophic nuclear incident is lower now than it was a decade ago.

 Other bearish events on the nuclear demand side would be a decision by China to abandon its  
 accelerated nuclear build program and/or cancel its planned and approved reactor construction projects. Similarly, a decision by the US, Europe India and/or Russia to withdraw support for their nuclear industry, retire nuclear power plants early abandon plans to life-extend the current reactor fleet to 80+ years or any major global shift in sentiment away from nuclear could put downward pressure on demand. As it stands today, there are no signs of that happening as the world is now taking a second look at embracing nuclear as a key solution to fight climate change.

What of nuclear Fusion to replace the world's Fission reactors? Anyone following the history of fission based nuclear power knows that it can take decades to prove up new technology develop the necessary regulatory framework establish safe and proven operating guidelines build and demonstrate a working commercial unit that harnesses the heat of the sun in a small reactor footprint that is not a risk to the environment and humanity. In my view we are decades away from achieving that goal and in the meantime all exsting nuclear reactors will continue to operate and more fission reactors will be built.

 As previously discussed the current bull market set up does not account for the introduction of  
 advanced Gen I reactors such as small modular reactors so any movement away from SMRS or failure  
 to deliver on expectations would do nothing at all to change the uranium supply dynamics as they are today. Similarly a deviation into alternative fuels for these new reactors in the 2030's does nothing to change the uranium supply vs demand dynamics of this decade.The uranium supply side, though more difficult to assess due to its inherent lack of visibility, does have a number of potentially bearish events to consider. The bear case that sits at the top of the list has been around for many years since before Kazakhstan moved to privatize its uranium mining industry, create a Swiss trading arm, and initiate a ""value over volume strategy of year-after-year flex-downs in supply. The argument is that Kazakhstan will simply ramp up its low-cost production to fill the supply gap and  
 prevent any further upward movement in uranium prices. In the pre-privatization era that might be a potential show-stopper but is it really today? Kazakhstan's current resources and production capacity is assigned an upward limit of about 73 Million pounds per year by its government as reported to the IAEA and by Kazatomprom to its investors. That's just 15 Million pounds per year above its current 58 Million pounds ""flex down"" level that has been extended through the end of 2022. Even if Kazatomprom were to take the irrational business decision to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to ""flex up"" production to its 73 Million pounds maximum so as to push down uranium prices, punish its bottom line and eliminate its dividend, it would still not be sufficient to fill the multi-year sustained supply gap that will continue to worsen over the coming decade. 

Similarly, other state-owned producers like Uzbekistan lack sufficient resources and production capacity to ramp up production to fill the supply gap. The Uzbeks announced last week that they are going to proceed with their plan to privatize their state-owned uranium mining company in the way Kazakhstan has done, so it appears the ""value over volume movement is gaining more momentum that further argues against this bear case.

 Barring some miraculous increase in mined uranium supply, the other sources of supply that could  
 potentially rise would be in Secondary Supply or some unknown hoarded inventory that a uranium player decides to release into the market. Japan has long been argued as a potential source of a large volume of uranium to be sold into the market but the evidence of that has been little to none. Having invested in a large inventory at much higher prices, and with majority of that inventory already in the form of fabricated fuel assemblies custom made for each unique reactor, Japanese utilities would need to take considerable losses if they chose to liquidate, and would also need to pay to have fuel rods disassembled and even then the enriched uranium contained therein would not likely be directly useful to a buyer in its current state. With Japan moving to restart more reactors and achieve a higher nuclear contribution level to achieve its own Net Zero carbon emissions goals, it seems more likely they will continue to hold on to all available ""fully paid for"" inventory to fuel their restarted reactors over the coming decade and even buy more uranium as more units are restarted.

 On Secondary Supply, the main source has been underfeeding in the uranium enrichment process and re-enrichment of depleted tails. I'm no expert in this area but my research shows that when there is a lack of demand for enrichment services, the enrichers will use that excess capacity in their centrifuges to ""underleed"" at the front end of an enrichment order and then sell the unused feed into the Spot market or offer it to other customers as a feed source at market prices. The key factor is that it is not technically possible to simply shut down centrifuges to save money. They must be kept spinning. Enrichers can recover their power costs by underfeeding to produce saleable matenal or reprocess depleted tails as a way to generate offsetting cash flow. If nuclear utilities continue to delay their contracting for enrichment services then underfeeding and tails re-enrichment will continue to produce secondary supply to dampen a uranium price rise. However arising SWU enrichment price and an expected rise in contracting after years of delays is expected by majority of analysts and nuclear fuel consultants to lead to a reduction in Secondary Supply over the coming years.  
 

A possible bear case event that could side-swipe the recovery in uranium prices would be the  
 announcement of another Megatons to Megawatts program by the US and/or Russia. This would involve the downblending of weapons grade (95%+ enriched uranium) down to the 5-7% level in order to make nuclear reactor fuel. This was done for 20 years from 1993-2013 and acted as a virtual uranium mine producing around 25 Million pounds per year, fueling half the US nuclear reactor fleet for 2 decades. If some new denuclearization effort were to emerge then this could happen again, but as things stand today it seems highly unlikely.

 Another possible bearish event would be the emergence of new inexpensive technology that could be used to convert nuclear waste and stockpiles of depleted uranium into nuclear reactor fuel. Companies are working on Laser Enrichment as such a technology that could revolutionize the enrichment industry and, if successful, help to produce more Secondary Supply to meet reactor fuel needs. As it stands, the processes involved are very expensive, and still many years away, which makes mining raw uranium, converting and enriching into reactor fuel using the establish nuclear fuel cycle of today, the cheapest way to go at the present time. When uranium prices spike far higher, expensive sources of secondary supply become more economically viable, but that makes this bear case dependent on there being a strong uranium bull market in the first place.

 What of Thorium as a replacement fuel? Thorium has been promoted as a better fuel source than  
 uranium but to this day it has not taken off into commercial use so the jury remains out on thorium  
 reactors as being economically or practically viable. The global nuclear industry has invested trillions of dollars into reactors, ennchment conversion and nuclear fuel fabrication facilities all based on uranium as the fuel source. There is incredibly strong inertia for that to continue into the future. Thorium has its own issues as well which have yet to be overcome. Converting the 500 operating & under construction reactors to operate on a different fuel is just not happening. There is no substitute for uranium today. Some point to recent news that uranium can be extracted from seawater as a bearish new technology to derail a bull market but the data on its development says otherwise. So far only very small quantities (grams) of uranium have been successfully extracted from large quantities of seawater. Producing tens of millions of pounds of fuel-grade uranium still appears to be decades away if a successful process can be developed on a large scale. The economics and environmental impact of such an industry are still big unknowns yet to be determined, so there is little likelihood of this emerging technology in its infancy today becoming a supply disruptor this decade though future prospects are encouraging.

 There are always going to be possible geopolitical events that can change the flow of uranium supply  
 and have a significant impact on nuclear fuel demand. Those were an issue decades ago heading into  
 the last uranium bull market and are just as probable today. However I think it is safe to say that  
 geopolitics sides with the uranium bull thesis as it more than likely involves disruption to supply than the opening up of some new source of uranium to meet global demand. The standard uranium  
 supply/demand models built by analysts assume smooth sailing for mine development activities, no  
 uranium trade issues and steady as she goes in terms of geopolitics History shows us that things rarely go as planned which I believe further strengthens the bull case investing thesis for uranium to be rock solid commodity for investors this decade. Those are a few of the bull and bear case arguments re explored.

TLDR: You made it to the end and I hope it was informative. The conclusion of this write up is quite simple really. While yes, there are several bear cases that could be considered when investing in uranium, all of them have solid counterarguments that have to be considered as a counterweight to those. There are few, if any, solid bear cases which will derail this investment thesis outside of the risk that we see a significant meltdown of another nuclear power plant. This thesis is getting stronger by the day and while equities have already ran up a lot and are due for a big more of a correction in the short term, the 3 to 4 year trend is clearly upwards and I will stick by the take I shared in October of last year, that uranium will be the best performing broad investment asset class from that point until roughly 2024/2025. Please remember to always do your own due diligence as none of this is investment advice and conviction cannot be copied. Hope you all have a great rest of your day and best of luck out there."
2021-04-20 10:26:04,stocks,"Thank you for the post, I am bullish on Uranium but is interesting to see the Bear Case. 

I think there is a ""soft"" cold war going on and countries are gonna rush to secure supplies of Uranium for energy, and defense when things start heating up between China, Iran and the rest of the world. They are definitely gonna push prices up, at least until fusion becomes viable, but who knows how long that's gonna be.  Just with that I am sure prices are at least gonna double, plus adding the whole ""carbon free"" future who knows how high it can go."
2021-04-20 10:15:27,stocks,"The real bear cases for uranium are:

1 - fusion

2 - fission reactors that use spent fuel (we've got a shit ton of that stuff just standing by at the reactors that used them up; we don't even have to go up that mountain and pull nuke waste out of the huge hole in the ground we built for it; we have enough spent fuel to last 100 years)"

2021-04-20 16:48:20,stocks,"Nuclear power in its current form has a significant problem in only running as baseload power. You can run a certain percentage of your power in base load, but with how much renewable energy is coming into the energy mix, assets with flexible output such as batteries, hydro and CCGT are of big importance for grid stability. This is a real weakness which makes it hard to argue the case of nuclear energy taking too big a part of a country’s energy mix.

I don’t have that many comments, and one of my last ones were also on the topic, so I probably look like an anti nuclear shill, but I work as a power trader, so it’s a topic I feel I have a bit of insight into"
2021-04-20 11:16:44,stocks,"The only real bear case is cost. Turning uranium into useful electricity costs a ton of money and is not very safe. Meanwhile, solar + battery are seeing their prices plummet yearly by about 10% if not more. They are already the cheapest form of energy and storage in some regions and as battery prices come down (which they will) they will put more pressure on other forms of generation.

Of course thats just the energy angle."
2021-04-20 11:01:59,stocks,I too have had this inner monologue with myself loving nuclear being so efficient and low downsides. However the 3 major incidents and push for renewables have stifled its growth and the previous havens in Germany and France have switched (to their detriment but still) away. I think with the lack of reliability of renewables I would think nuclear paired with that would be the push for most countries that are looking to move away from fossil fuels but we shall see.
2021-04-20 17:57:55,stocks,The bear case for uranium is that it costs [$155 for a MWh of energy](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth) from nuclear energy while natural gas costs $56 and solar/wind $40. It costs a premium to generate energy from it.
2021-04-20 11:08:24,stocks,"There are signs of retiring plants early in the US.  NY just said Indian Point is shutdown forever,  even though the replacement power will come from Natural gas,  by truck because they can't finish the pipeline.   Also,  the Ohio SB 6 bribery thing by First Energy can could possibly cause enough backlash to shutdown Perry and Davis-Besse.  There could be more early shutdowns.  

On your bull case, you should add military reactors.   The US submarine fleet is old and is retiring faster than new ones are being built right now.   That will change since the SSBNs can't extend their service live too much longer and the Fast Attack submarines are very important to any potential conflict between the US and China.   Remember,  submarines don't get re-fuled so retiring them doesn't lower demand and the new ones get 30 years of fuel. 

Unfortunately,  the risks are near term and the benefits are a decade away.   Obviously the market is forward looking,  but how long do you want to wait to see good returns?"
2021-04-20 11:39:40,stocks,At least a double is definitely on the cards and thanks for the kind words.
2021-04-20 17:52:31,stocks,"Yeah, China won't be stupid enough to build new reactors that require uranium from a third party. China won't shit wehete they eat (so to speak) and with growing tension they'll make sure their uranium needs are met without relying on the ""western"" world."
2021-04-20 12:52:10,stocks,"1 - Fusion is a long long way off.  You will be dead before there is commercial production of power by fusion.

2 - One of the big reasons we don't reprocess used fuel is because it is more economical to pull it out of the ground.  Eventually this won't be true but that is a few decades off.  Because of limited demand, we stopped most of the uranium exploration that was being done in the 50s.  There is a lot out there.

The real bear case in the West is that science deniers spent fifty years putting up road blocks to increase the price and construction time of nuclear power plants.  This resulted in lessened R&D in nuclear power.  The phony green idiots in Europe pretending to care about climate change are shutting down nuclear plants to rely on coal power."
2021-04-20 11:04:27,stocks,"Not just breeder reactors but...

3 - thorium pebble bed reactors

4 - solar wind and battery power is already cheaper than any of this

Investing in Uranium is highly speculative and not a sure thing.  So many risks are blowing in the energy sector that could make this commodity practically useless.  It’s a bet that 40 year old technology will come back into fashion again."

2021-04-20 17:54:57,stocks,"You are right, which means they are gonna gobble up whatever is outside, leaving the west with less mines, and pushing them to keep up and ramp mining. At least that's my logic. For uranium, and other rare metals."

Yeah some of the shorts are abusive, but we do need them to a degree. If we don't financially incentivise the search for corporate fraud, good luck having auditors or the government pick up the slack"

It looks like they're building up the rest of the market, to pull the rug. This will coincide with those squeezes, IMO. I went all in on AMC, to defend against this inevitable eventuality. It's like The Big Short, only in reverse. Those all-in longs chasing those two stocks, are essentially, and indirectly, shorting the entire speculative, bubble market, via irresponsible hedge fund tactics. Just a matter of time before hedge funds fold/cover, or get margin called (already started), flipping the entire market. Who will pay for this? Passively managed retail accounts; pensions, IRAs, and individual accounts that are heavily invested in managed funds (mutual funds, ETFs, etc.)."

I guess the one thing to look for though is what the catalyst is. The dot-com bubble and the housing bubble popped and crashed as a result of massive differences between financial market prices and the intrinsic value of the assests/securities. Do we honestly have that here? I mean its Earnings Season and companies are putting up massive numbers. 

I think the market is somewhat inflated, but not yet enough to warrant concern of a type like the last two bubbles."

They are shorting these stocks and restricting people from buying them, talk about rigged markets! It’s straight up theft! They think they can get away with it because we are not US based investors and the OTC market is less regulated! Let me tell you we have a lot of p’d off investor who want answers about why this manipulation is being allowed to take place!"

2021-04-20 11:55:50,stocks,"This article is complete fake trash from garbage Bloomberg.  First of all, there isn't mass euphoria at this point.  All speculative stocks in the market including penny stocks and many small & mid cap stocks have literally been destroyed over the past two months.  Check any growth stock out that isn't a large cap, 99% chance it's lost over 20% since mid February.

You have to look closely at the market right now, the indices are grinding higher but what are the indices mostly made up of?  FAANG stocks.  We keep seeing the S&P500 higher and higher so we think it's a great market but if you looked at what most stocks are actually doing right now, the sentiment of the market would quickly become bearish.

Also, Wall Street is literally shorting everything and anything into the ground right now so of course Bloomberg puts out an article saying the opposite because they are in with the Hedge Funds.  Retail aren't just selling these spec stocks because they decided in 3 weeks they don't like them anymore, many small caps are being shorted at extreme levels right now and it's easy to see from the nonstop bleeding week after week."
2021-04-20 15:22:17,stocks,"This article is totally accurate if you don’t look at stocks like GOEV and CLOV. Because those definitely aren’t shorted to the depths of hell with high failure-to-deliver, nearly no shares left to short, and high interest rates on short positions (like 27% for GOEV). Definitely nothing to see here, definitely no shortsellers, move along. 😐"

2021-04-20 18:49:23,stocks,"Yeah, I applaud what they did, to some degree. The trouble is, the shorting is a counter weight to pump money back into the system when the correction occurs by covering when an over valued stock falls back in line to it's real value.

Those idiots, the, ""crayon eating,"" ""smooth brained apes,"" are too stupid to realise that they've likely removed the only thing that we had to cushion the blow of the next market crash... as we all know, it's coming soon and it's going be a big one wiping incredible wealth off the table. 

They struck a blow to the big bad wall street shorts. Which, in a lot of cases, these shorts have way too much power and influence. They put an end to the abuse for now. I just wish there was a better way to stop the abuse without such a binary approach."

Every bubble in history has popped - there are always winners who stay or swim back to the top, but right now dead-beat IPOs and  SPACs with a blockchain, EV, or subscription-model buzzword are getting over-valued, despite market corrections.

Just scary to see how easy it is for social media posters to take absolute sides without thinking about the big picture. Society still runs on food, gas and urban economies (work/culture centers). Speculative excitement and bail-out money are still running hot with this bull cycle."

Was hoping someone could tell me why the chart on EToro for Rolls Royce (RR.L) is different to one shown on LSE when I look back at them. For instance if I look at the EToro chart in 2019 its moving between around 700 - 950, but on the LSE chart its much lower, around the 300 mark all year.

They seem to have the same current price and both are in GBX, but I feel like maybe the EToro one is a different instrument or something, but it is hard to tell. If someone knows why it would be a big help thanks."

Oh well, at least it's a great dip to buy for now. The news about 'euphoria' are kind of tongue-in-cheeks though.

Problems with shorting in general is that if you have such a position you keep losing tons of money as long as the stock doesn't go down, and it can keep not going down for endless years.

That means something that has limited upside and literally unlimited downside is not really a great investment field to begin with. So its only logical the most that dives into shorting are either stupid, **or know for sure that the stock price will go down or can force it to go down.**

There is just no incentive and never was to pick a shitty company and open a short position on it, anyone that plays with clean hands would rather invest in tons of more beneficial ways."

Maybe that will finally provide some incentive towards solving wealth inequality, because it's certainly not the bottom 50% of the wealth ladder pumping so much money into the market.

Whether thats through economic populism riding an anti wall street wave, or establishment politicians wanting to stave off the pissed off voters of portfolio bagholders, the answer is to open the valve and relieve some of the pressure that is driving prices up so high. Although I worry that no one who actually has power will come to that conclusion."

2021-04-20 12:49:56,stocks,"There's a saying, ""buy the rumor, sell the news"". Once the information is at the point where it's being discussed on the news and has a compelling case, others have already taken advantage of the facts and it's now reflected in the price.

Like, if there's a compelling case for some company's product to be a major success and will have a great earnings report, for example, then people have already taken advantage of it until it the price is at a level consistent with that information. It's the idea of [market efficiency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketefficiency.asp). It's true to an extent and an explanation for why you often see stock prices drop after great earnings reports.

There's also another joke about it that I love:

HFs engaged in actual naked shorting (not just shorting for liquidity purposes or hit piece shorting like hindeburg or citron et al but rather the Melvin/Citadel bankruptcy jackpot brand of shorting) are the tick on the leech on the vulture of US capitalism. Their MO is to suppress and strangle the stock price of small to mid-sized US companies producing jobs and innovation in order to dry up capital and drive the price low enough that it gets delisted and the company moves into bankruptcy all so they can take their profit tax free thus returning nothing to the society. At least old school vulture capitalism was done via a hostile takeover then saddling the company with debt before selling it for parts and taxes would sometimes have to be paid throughout that process. In this hyper-financialized version of it we basically see the destruction of all productive assets, defrauding of the shareholders by large financial institutions who never intended to buy shares back, and a loss of jobs for nothing in return except to those who have the means to invest in these highly sophisticated hedge vehicles (typically not individuals). The only people pitiable when naked shorters are exposed are the pensioners who's management was stupid enough to invest with these crooks. GME is just the smoking gun that got attention on this issue in the general public but if anyone's interested they've been successfully nakedly shorting companies out of existence since 2008 and the SEC and DTCC have been looking the other way."

You make a poor investment decision , your stock goes down and in your mind you say “it’s the hedge funds fault” that’s just a weak minded way to approach things. This idea that the hedge funds are too blame for everything started 3 months ago with the influx of all these noob investors who have no idea what they are doing.

The hedge funds aren’t as big as you think they are, they are all competing against each other meaning that they rarely work together. The majority of them don’t even engage in short selling as there are so many other, more profitable less risky ways to invest.

Oh and GME will never ever get too one million a share. You are so delusional to believe the lies they have been telling you."
2021-04-20 16:31:25,stocks,"Overbought in the present.... The revenue of the majority of these companies doesn’t warrant its current stock price. They will sell off and in a year there will be more buying pushing the stocks to new all time highs. Then they will be overbought again, sell off and the cycle will continue. It’s part of the market cycle of high growth companies/sectors. The buying frenzy always pushes it too far too fast, there’s a correction and then with time buying comes back."

It can prevent a company from being able to raise any equity on good terms.

The list is pretty long and well documented. For an easy example, look up ""death spirals"" for small companies, a known method of a big investor destroying legitimate companies with a very high success rate."
2021-04-20 11:01:39,stocks,"Yes they can. They make the business look shaky. The obvious one is that the business now cant raise capital on the market, and banks arent gonna want to give a loan to companies that are headed for 0.

Shorting is not viable to market at its core but as the market is now it is absolutely viable and necessary, unless you want rapid drops without anyone to backstop them."
2021-04-20 13:36:49,stocks,Plus shorting or the process of betting on the downside is tremendously helpful when stocks and other equities go down so that huge institutions don't go bankrupt. In 08 the banks were too long and when the market dipped they went under. Being able to bet on the downside is extremely important and useful whether you use it or not.
2021-04-20 19:48:02,stocks,No. Not like that.
2021-04-20 12:24:24,stocks,GME is its own monster at this point. The short interest is way down on it from where it was so it isn't a squeeze play. It if anything is this weird volatility play where people are playing both sides. Options on it are crazy. It is a big tug of war game that has nothing to do with fundamentals of the company. It is just...weird now.
2021-04-20 16:33:03,stocks,The only issue is there is a reason SOS is shorted and oversold. The company is a scam.
2021-04-20 13:21:56,stocks,Makes total sense in theory but personally I’ve found it difficult in practice. When something is crashing it’s almost counter intuitive to throw money at it. Trying to get better at this.
2021-04-20 13:55:47,stocks,"lol, I bought tesla back in 2019  and 2020 because I really liked what they were making.  I think I purchased less than $5k  (2.5k I think?) because I wasn't confident.

It, at one point, was worth 50k.  Believe me, I was saying I wish I'd bought more."
2021-04-20 15:47:51,stocks,"There is actually a clear answer to your question:

The intrinsic value of a stock is the unlimited stream of future dividends. It's downright near impossible to short a healthy stock to $0.

Let's say I invest in a Company with a market cap of $500M and a $10 share price. The company is operating at a loss, but growing steadily. Wall st decides to short this stock to all hell. Within 6 months the price is under $1 per share.

If the company declares they will start paying an annual dividend of $.01 per share. The situation changes. 

Present Value = .01 (dividend)   /    .025 (discount rate)

I used 2.5% as the discount rate, as this should outpace inflation in the current market.

So, the value of this stock is $.40.
Meaning that if the stock price falls below $.40, I can essentially get free money. As such, the price couldn't fall lower than $.40 because you're betting against people taking free money.
Paying out a .01 dividend would only cost $500k per year.
This would be a relatively small expense to pay for a $500M dollar company.
Increasing the dividend to $.02 would increase share value to $.80, and so on.

Because of this, no fund would ever try to run a healthy small caps share price into the ground. Mid cap and large caps are absolutely out of the question, as they even more likely to have cash on hand.

Now that is the extreme scenario, more than likely when a price drops below a certain point (way before approaching under a dollar) a stock is seen as a good deal by investors. People will buy a stock on the cheap and stabilize the price.

Now let's say, the company doesn't care about their share price being attacked, it doesn't affect their financial performance after all. They get delisted and start trading OTC. If they are a good company, they will continue growing their business and their price will come back up. 

TL;DR You can't short a healthy stock to zero, it's a great time to buy small caps!"
2021-04-20 11:49:11,stocks,"It makes sense when you realize that wall street has been doing this for decades. It's their go to move, literally anything that they aren't making money on gets shorted so they can make money on it, until they can buy in and make more money. If for whatever reason buying in after shorting won't make them much money, as in they know that the price can't recover for what ever reason. Then they finish the job and bring in the naked shorts to force the company into bankruptcy. It's about them staying rich and you staying poor, that's why it makes sense. The ""free-market"" is a lie, it doesn't exist."
2021-04-20 11:37:26,stocks,"Just like going long, there's no guarantee that shorting it will make it go to 0. If it's a solid company with good financials, outlook etc it most likely won't go to 0. 

Shorting is also inherently more risky than going long, because the upside is capped at 100% (when stock goes to 0) but the downside is theoretically infinite if the stock keeps going up."
2021-04-20 12:02:16,stocks,"If your short bets are paying, then it absolutely makes sense"
2021-04-20 14:11:45,stocks,"Healthy stock, or healthy company?  If a healthy company (in financials, growth) is shorted to a fraction of its natural value, then I might happily buy some at the discount."
2021-04-20 14:52:40,stocks,"What completely healthy stocks have been shorted to $0? so far I've seen TMBR who have had a single positive EPS quarter ever and have diluted and reversed split a ton, Toys R Us who were a private company so literally couldnt be shorted, HMNY who went bankrupt because they were buying movie tickets, then turning around and selling them at a loss, and Gamestop who reported declining revenues for 11 of the last 12 quarters"
2021-04-20 18:07:20,stocks,Anyone who invests in small cap is dumb.
2021-04-20 13:51:12,stocks,What *completely healthy* stock are you talking about? Hedgies need to smell blood in the water first. A profitable company can theoretically run with zero market valuation.

I haven’t been lied to and led to believe “this is how the market works” for years like it sounds you have been. I started with no knowledge of the stock market except that media lies their asses off and big money gets its way and that goes for any walk of life I’m big in to politics and know how the world operates.

So I came in blind and it’s already blatantly obvious the entire stock market has been manipulated by these massive hedgefunds the entire time. Just look at the facts. Fundamentals have never mattered it’s just used as an excuse to manipulate the stock either way. 

Ohh noo not $1 million a share? What ever will I do?? GME is hitting 6 figures at a minimum."
2021-04-20 16:56:34,stocks,That's the problem with that sentiment is that you never know when these things are going to pop. I waited too long to buy in on tesla last year after their massive dip and I missed out on serious gains. My girlfriend and I picked up MRNA at 20-30$ a share and made really good gains. Some times the news cycle beats the revenue cycle and a lot of people don't even realize how much of a game changer federal regulatory changes would be just by getting marijuana out of the schedule 1 classification.

2021-04-20 11:24:47,stocks,"According to Yahoo, TMBR have no revenue? And their share price has hardly moved a lot over the last 6 months. If they're in trouble it's their own problem and nothing to do with shorters."
2021-04-20 11:05:10,stocks,And which businesses are usually the heaviest shorted? The most poorly performing ones. The companies “being shorted” to bankruptcy are already failing. I’d short a weak company any day if it means profiting big.

2021-04-20 19:17:29,stocks,"This perspective lines up perfectly with my finance textbook from many years ago. In that sense, it’s not wrong. However, this view relies on the assumption that every company is representative of the average and/or will revert to the mean. In real life, a company that performs exactly as statistics would predict is extremely difficult to find. The competition that we rely on to drive innovation keeps individual companies from remaining average. If a company’s stock doesn’t perform, it harms the finances of its principals, and then it cannot recruit or maintain talent. This is just one in a long list of reasons events don’t follow the expected course. Companies must grow and adapt or die."

I gave three scenarios of what could happen if a company is over shorted to highlight how no matter how things play out, the healthy small cap will come out on top. It's not an exhaustive list of how a company could react either. 

Also, keep in mind, in this scenario we're discussing a healthy growing company being shorted, not a struggling company at risk of bankruptcy. I don't think I've ever heard of an instance where a healthy company had it's stock price drop to zero as a direct result of it being shorted.

A healthy small cap will have positive shareholder equity, which by definition means the company still has value after clearing all it's debt obligations. At liquidation, any proceeds from liquidated assets would go to shareholders. Meaning the stock has a value greater than $0 as a matter of fact. Which means you can't short a healthy company to $0."

**- Maintained backlog of approximately $147 billion**

BETHESDA, Md., April 20, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Lockheed Martin Corporation \[NYSE: LMT\] today reported first quarter 2021 net sales of $16.3 billion, compared to $15.7 billion in the first quarter of 2020. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2021 were $1.8 billion, or $6.56 per share, compared to $1.7 billion, or $6.08 per share, in the first quarter of 2020. Cash from operations in the first quarter of 2021 was $1.7 billion, compared to $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2020.

""Lockheed Martin continues to deliver vital next generation technologies that will help keep our nation and its allies safe, and advance space exploration, while providing long-term value for the U.S. taxpayers and our shareholders,"" said Lockheed Martin Chairman, President and CEO James Taiclet. ""Our strong financial results position us to continue advancing 21st Century innovations that will deter the threats of the future, while remaining a trusted partner for customers who depend on our existing platforms and services today.

As previously announced, the severance and restructuring charges are to close and consolidate certain facilities and reduce total workforce within the Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business segment. The actions are being taken to better align RMS' organization and cost structure to improve the efficiency of its operations and affordability of its products and services.

>Banking sources said on Thursday that the flotation, which will crystallise a big paper windfall for the company's founder, Nick Jones, could reach a valuation of as much as $4bn (£2.9bn).

>The company considered an IPO two years ago but opted to raise capital privately instead.

>Despite the pandemic forcing many of its clubs around the world to close, the business has proved to be resilient, with barely 10% of its 110,000 members cancelling their subscription.

Didn't see a post about this, think it flew under the radar a bit. Luxury goods/services seems to have grown massively in the pandemic somehow. 

Not sure about this one, I'm a fan of Soho House as a place to go, would be nice to get a membership, but their entire business is based around going down there in person, using the facilities they have provided, can't use any of it at home AFAIK. 

Could be a good recovery stock though, post pandemic when flights resume the network could be handy for members, it's so hard to get a membership that I suspect a lot of people didn't cancel because they would never get it back if they did.

2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Stem Inc ($STPK) DD **Stem Inc - Due Diligence**

Stem Inc (ticker STPK) was established in 2009 and is a provider of battery storage and AI optimisation software to Utilities and Large Corporates (including Amazon, Facebook and UPS) in the US, Canada and Japan.

**Total Addressable Market and Market Position**

Stem is the market leader in the fast-growing energy storage market. Wood Mackenzie forecast a Total Addressable Market for energy storage of $1.2 trillion by 2050, and for the battery storage market to increase by 25x by 2030. The size of Stem’s market is rapidly expanding due to:

1. The declining cost of batteries, driving increased adoption. This is already happening with Electric Vehicle batteries, and the same economies of scale are benefiting Stem. Batteries are now increasingly being installed with solar and wind to reduce their intermittency
2. Stem is expecting to see the introduction of a standalone investment tax credit in the US for clean energy storage, allowing storage to be eligible for tax concessions (matching the concessions available to solar & wind). This is expected to open up a variety of new markets in the US.
3. The Biden administration has proposed a $100 billion investment to transform the energy grid, putting the US on a path to achieving 100% carbon free electricity. Batteries and smart software are required to manage renewable’s intermittency.
4. Broader Clean Energy / ESG mandate from large corporates and governments worldwide. There will be plenty of macro catalysts for Stem in the coming years

Stem is the market leader with 75% market share in the Californian battery storage market (larger than their next 4 competitors combined), with California being the largest market in the US. Stem has a first mover advantage, as they’re already operating with over 40 utilities, 5 grid operators, for a cumulative total of more than 20 million run-time hours. This is the equivalent to Stem already operating 12 gas peaker plants (1 GWH).

Stem sources batteries from Tier 1 manufacturers, including LG, Tesla and Samsung. They are one of the largest purchasers of utility grade batteries in the US, and are agnostic on who’s batteries they install – their software can attach to nearly any battery. In terms of their supplier’s bargaining power, they see Tesla as operating in a different market to them. Tesla is seen as doing much larger projects, such as the Australian ‘Big Battery’. They also see Tesla as primarily a manufacturer, who’s trying to scale their output (similar to how Foxconn is a manufacturer to Apple). They’re also not dependent upon Tesla batteries, as they can switch to other suppliers. Interestingly, they believe they introduced Tesla to the Japanese market!

**Stem’s Competitive Advantage – Athena AI**

Essentially Stem’s business model is supplying and installing a Battery and AI Software bundle. Stem’s AI software, called Athena, is their competitive advantage over other battery providers.

Athena is a propriety, patented, AI optimisation software which Stem bundle with battery installation. Athena analyses large data sets (over 700,000 data points per second) in real time to optimise electricity flows. It takes into account energy prices, grid dynamics, weather, and customer usage patterns to lower their electricity costs by up to 30%.

It does this, by example, by taking advantage of electricity price fluctuations. Very simply, Athena will instruct batteries to charge when prices are low (say during the day when solar panels are generating lots of surplus power) and discharge into the grid when prices are high (say during the evening when solar is off). This electricity market participation creates value for their customers and for Stem. There are 13 ways in which Athena creates value for customers, with this just being a simple example of a price arbitrage scenario.

I believe Athena has a strong competitive ‘moat’ due to:

1. Athena is attached to 100% of Stem’s battery sales, and at no point has a customer ever asked for the software to be removed. Stem has 75% market share of the Californian battery storage market, illustrating the strong demand for Athena
2. Athena generates 80% Gross Margins, which demonstrates both the lack of substitute software solutions and the value that customers place on Athena
3. Athena gets better with more use. There are more than 950 systems operating or contracted with Athena, which have collectively generated more than 20 million runtime hours of data, generating a wealth of data to train and improve Athena. This data itself is a source of competitive advantage, with battery suppliers reportedly seeking to purchase this data from Stem. Competitors simply don’t have this data, don’t have a market leading position to generate this data, and don’t have the luxury of time to make up the shortfall.

**Strengthened Balance sheet**

The main tangible benefit of the merger with Star Peak Energy Transition Corp (ticker STPK) is the cash – Stem has a war chest of $525m to pursue growth. Stem is going to use these funds to grow in 4 tangible ways

1. Reduction in Working Capital. Prior to its strengthened balance sheet, Stem had to pay 100% for batteries up-front, and wouldn’t get paid by the customer until the project was complete. This meant Stem had to fund the holding cost of the battery purchase for several months, which curtailed their growth. With its stronger balance sheet, Stem expects to negotiate better deals with its supplier’s, driving a $100m improvement in working capital over the next 24 months
2. Bid on larger projects. Multiple times in the past, large utility owners have curtailed Stem’s level of participation on projects due to a lack of balance sheet strength. This cut Stem’s project participation to just 30%, 40% or 50%. However, going forward with the stronger balance sheet, they expect to land larger opportunities
3. Further investment in Athena, to extend its market leading position
4. International expansion

**Valuation**

Stem has provided guidance to 2026, with a Revenue CAGR of 80% from 2020 to 2026. 2021 revenue is expected to be 4.5x 2020 revenue. 2021’s revenue is already secured by signed customer contracts – Stem is actively is executing on these. Further confidence in revenue forecasts comes from a contracted backlog of $200m (as of 17 January 2021).

Revenue quality is underpinned by Stem’s contracting model - Athena is provided on a 10 to 20 year subscription term in conjunction with the battery sale. This provides significant and predictable long term cash flows beyond just an upfront battery sale.

A Discount Cash Flow analysis of their Free Cash Flow forecast, plus their $525m cash, equates to **$47.80/share** (8% discount rate, 2.5% perpetual growth rate), representing substantial upside from the current stock price. Upside to this target is possible from market expansion and government policy changes, including:

1. Movement into residential properties. This is an untapped market, with Stem actively considering how best to enter this market. Entry into the residential market is not included in their FCF
2. Upside from the proposed energy storage investment tax credit. Stem’s FCF forecast was released in December 2020, before Biden took office
3. Upside from Biden’s proposed $100 billion investment to transform the energy grid. Similarly, Stem’s FCF forecast was released in December 2020, before Biden took office

2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Portfolio diversification question Hi folks,

I am 18 years old, and I want to be little bit agressive with my investing and growing my portfolio, but I also want to invest long-term. I am younger so I have more porential to invest for grow.

What percentage should I use for my portfolio? Maybe something like 50% etf, 50% tech stocks or something else.

I want to hear your opinions and examples, thank you! 🙏"
2021-04-20 06:51:57,stocks,"Firstly, congratulations for taking this step at a very young age! You must definitely be proud of this decision you made.
Secondly, and most importantly, forget about this flawed explanation you’ve heard almost every amateur tell others “when you’re young be aggressive” or “put money into stocks you’re willing to lose”. That is one of the most popular lies people tell each other rather than admit they don’t know what they are doing. 
I mean why would you invest when your goal is to grow your money, but you hear others “advice” you there is always the risk you might lose it all 🙄 That is not investing at all. 
There is a book by the legendary Jack C. Bogle called “The Little book on Common Sense Investing”. I want you to find the strength and the discipline to study that book, not just read it for the sake of telling others you read it. That book will open your eyes to the foolishness of majority of the market participants, and save you from making the mistakes most of us make. 
You’ve taken the step in the right direction at such a young age, sir. Don’t make mistakes listening to unprofessional advice. Every, and I mean every single successful investor will tell you, their success was not because they picked winning stocks or they discovered some magical formula. Their success was simply because they made very few mistakes throughout their investment lifetime and grew their wealth over time. 

Good luck to you! 

(Lol I understand I’m a stranger on the internet, but you may believe me or not. I am a financial advisor, a licensed CPA and Tax attorney in Washington, D.C. and this is financial advice)"
2021-04-20 06:56:26,stocks,Please don't buy a tech etf and tech stocks and call it diversification.  I've seen so many people buy different tech stocks and call their portfolio diversified.
2021-04-20 11:08:01,stocks,"Not sure what your entry point is in terms of $, but as an 18 year old, your life is lightspeed right now and you really need to enjoy the moments. Not saying that this shouldn't become a prime hobby or even a ""career"", but I'd honestly put my money in a managed brokerage account. Yes, you pay a small management fee off the top, but they'll set you up with a diversified portfolio based off your risk tolerance levels. As an 18 year old, basics say to be aggressive because you have ALOT of time left on the game clock. But I'd honestly let a firm manage 80% of your account, And you keep 20% to learn on your own. And then, given enough time and experience, you might feel comfortable to take the reins entirely.

My biggest mistake was keeping cash in a checking account in my early 20s, because I was too afraid and incompetent on what to do with it. Put it into a managed account to let it start working for you, while you keep a small sliver of it to ""live and learn"" with.

Just my two cents. You'll get full exposure (large, mid, small cap, US based, internatoinal, value, growth, and even some bond exposure too). That's where you want to start building that massive nest...and at 18, you're doing it which is so important for long term wealth management.

Think of it as that. Wealth management (even if you don't think it's ""wealth""). You need to think long term. Let someone manage it for a few years while you day/week trade on the side a bit. Don't ""live and learn"" with all of it. You can live and learn with just 20% and then put the remaining 80% into a managed account (and watch how they manage it...you'll learn alot from just watching your own managed account and the decisions those algorithms make).

I'm in my mid 30s, kids, house, cars, etc...the whole ""upper"" middle class shebang. And, like I said, I didn't start investing until around 25. But through ""dollar cost averaging"" (learn this term) through monthly contributions to my managed account, I'm seeing 6 figures of literally just ""play"" money. It's not retirement (which I also have in the form of both a Roth and 401k), and it's not a rainy day fund (which I've built and stashed in a money market account). It is literally my ""wealth"" management account that my wife and I don't have earmarked for anything in particular. Our monthly cash flow covers all expenses and we make contributions to all our accounts without fault.

We still don't have a plan for the account, but it really is just there to build long term wealth, and we will continue to DCA the account, through the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. Our retirement accounts should see us be millionaires at retirement, while this managed account should see us be multi-millionaires by retirement. We still have about 30 years of employment left, so plenty of time to go through crashes/bears and bulls. But the important aspect to wealth growth is stable cash flow (employment and budgeting) and monthly contribution to retirement and investment accounts (DCA).

Starting at 18, and you should be ahead of us by a decade if nothing insane happens."
2021-04-20 05:51:55,stocks,"It really depends on what is in the ETFs. I personally am just a bit older than you (but started in the same age) and own only FAANG and financials. I constantly track my performance against a benchmark (S&P 500) and if I do worse than it for a certain amount of time, I will sell everything and invest it in SPY."
2021-04-20 06:27:09,stocks,"My biggest mistake when I started investing was that I was gambling more than investing. 

Buy good companies. Try to pick good entry points. Preferably when the stock is on sale during a correction. Vanguard S&P500 is a good way to diversify. Make sure that you are not holding a stock directly and within ETF unless you want to.

Try to buy some good dividend growth stocks. If the market tanks, at least you will be collecting dividend while you wait."
2021-04-20 06:55:36,stocks,"if you buy an exchange traded fund, you will be diversified in terms of stock, but maybe not sector.  the look through ownership will give you some diversification"
2021-04-20 06:56:36,stocks,"Do you want to actively manage your portfolio, or do you want to ""set it and forget it""?  If you are going to be picking individual stocks, you will need to do research beforehand, and keep up with their news, both good and bad, to make decisions about altering your position.  ETFs are the easy way to invest and let someone else manage the individual companies that are contained within the fund.  The only thing I would caution is to look at the top holdings of an ETF to make sure you aren't overlapping too much with another ETF that you plan to buy.  You don't want to put money into three different funds if all three have major holdings in Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc.  You should either consolidate down to one or spread your money and risk out to other areas like value, international, consumer, etc.

Personally, my retirement and long term accounts are all only invested in one thing...high cap growth funds.  I'm 40 this year and will keep my money invested this way until I am closer to late 50s, at which point I will transition over to less aggressive/risky investments."
2021-04-20 11:35:27,stocks,"Always start with that thing between your ears. That is the key to performance long term. Smarter you are, the better your performance. Ill just share my experience:

When I started, around age 20 near end of college (Bioengineering degree), I went at it alone thinking I was smart enough to do so... and failed. Lost about $5k or so. BUT... I learned more from that $5k than my $30k in college. Why? Because I was exposed to everything and looked into every nook and cranny for information. I absorbed it all. All that stuff they teach in business school, I picked it up in about 2 months plus, I learned how crashes happen in a practical sense (.com in this case) and how to avoid them in the future.

2007 rolls around. I have about $50k laying around from treasuries. I turn it to about $2m by 2013. How? By this point I was also a real estate expert (took license courses for fun and worked on the side). I knew the crash was coming and I knew which businesses would survive.

2020 rolls around. I was already out of the market by Feb (had a bunch of Tesla and got out). Crash happens, I jump back in about 1 week before bottom, and my returns since last year are about 300% (not counting my real estate portfolio). How? I knew which stocks to buy at the bottom of that crash. I knew who got hit unfairly (small cap non-cyclicals), who would get bailed out (airlines), and who was going to get hammered (brick and mortar entertainment) and who will actually make more during the shutdowns (video games) and I knew when we would have a vaccine give or take a month before anyone talked about it and I even got the death toll almost perfect for 2020... sadly... I was hoping I would be wrong.

Where am I now?

* 50% cash (well... originally... the gains this year made it lopsided)
* 20% blue chip non-cyclical (I call them anchors)
* 10% dividend for dry powder (REITs - healthcare and maybe residential once they get pounded by end of covid moratorium), and some preferred stock
* 10% high growth established big companies (costco, sbux, etc)
* 10% speculative high growth (but this has already gone up to about 20% on its own this year)

Not saying to do what I do above, but definitely invest in yourself. Started a family about 8 years ago and got a 2nd degree around 2015 for giggles (Computer Science) and right now it looks like my salary is about to jump to about $350k thanks to that degree and past experience.... Knowledge is king. Balance is important too. Family is tough, but worth it. If I make another mil this year or next, Ill go back for another degree of some sort. Maybe something less serious this time since time is harder to find.

Moral of the story? Keep learning. Learn everything. Absorb it all. You never know when a opportunity will come along and you either know the answer and capitalize or you dont. Thats how you become a good investor."
2021-04-20 06:33:32,stocks,"I think the breakdown should reflect your knowledge of industries and where you think strong future growth is. I work as a data scientist so I have a decent understanding of useful tech products, plus what tools are popular. This led to investments in ESTC, DDOG, and TWLO. From doing a fair bit of reading, there are some industries with specific companies that I like: online retail (SHOP, MELI, SE), real estate (RDFN, ZG), computing (AMD, NVDA). For industries that I want exposure to, but am less familiar with, I go with an ETF (ARKG).

The breakdown of my investments reflects my expected growth for these stocks/industries. I'm 90:10 stocks to ETFs, but I own multiple stocks in some industries so this acts a bit like a small ETF as the risk is spread."

But if you bought [pets.com](https://pets.com) and similar stocks you'd have $0."

When you finish studying the book I suggested, it will make sense/ you will understand better about this whole “growth vs value” investing debate folks love to have. It’s natural to feel that way: to think investing more in growth stocks/ ETFs will grow your money more. 

But I’m sure, once you understand how the whole market mechanism works, you will think differently. 
Good luck! 🙋🏾‍♂️"

Lol I’m a fan of the group, they make me laugh and lighten up everything. But I’m not on there to debate people or argue with others. Some people on there really do share some great analysis of a company’s financial statements. There is a theory in the Accounting Literature which a lot of us boring academics believe in called “The Efficient Market Hypothesis”, groups like u/Wallstreetbets are evidence that the theory is valid."

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

On Saturday, a new SEC Chairman was [sworn in](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-17/biden-pick-gary-gensler-is-sworn-in-as-sec-chairman), and he has promised to be [tough on companies](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-candidate-for-sec-chairman-is-expected-to-be-tough-on-companies-11611743403).

Saturday night after midnight, some Redditors noticed that the lights for the executives floors of banks, market makers, and major finance lawyers were lit up all night long and that Google data on their phones showed they were extremely active. The subreddit that discovered this is full of crazy people, but, this time, it [checks out](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtgr19/a_breakdown_of_citadels_overnight_activity/).

Monday morning, futures were blood red and, throughout the day, the market kept plummeting.

That's what I know for sure. I *assume* that these three dots connect and that finance companies are freaked out that the new SEC Chairman is actually going to do something. Either way, they're selling off hard.

**Why won't the red stop?**

Technical analysis swings the market. There are analysts at every investment company, and so if something *looks* bearish on a chart, it will *become* bearish in reality.

Last week, we were on an escalator to the moon. Yesterday, we fell off. [Here's a picture](https://i.redd.it/3u41lenp35u61.jpg) from the NASDAQ daily chart.

That firmly cemented Friday's high as a resistance line, which means that people using technical analysis are likely going to wait for the market to hit support before they start buying again. Those support lines [look like this](https://i.redd.it/vxyjkx3pk5u61.jpg).

Today, we should get a brief respite as we hit a support line at QQQ's previous ATH close of $336.45, but I don't think that'll hold as the week goes on.

**How bad could this get?**

It should be fine.

*Most likely,* this is just going to be a minor delay in momentum and we'll bounce back when we hit support. The market is bullish and all news is great, so even though we're going into a few red days, this won't even register as a drawback.

The only thing that worries me is the small cap companies. The Russell looks like it's getting ready to make a [head and shoulders](https://i.redd.it/mt6nircwg5u61.jpg), which will be a major sell sign for people who use technical analysis.

That won't just affect small caps. If the Russell crashes, the market will go with it. In 2007, right before the crash, there was a major correction. The NASDAQ appeared to get out of it -- but anyone watching the Russell would have seen that [it wasn't over](https://i.redd.it/g29mccosg5u61.jpg) and that a bigger crash was coming.

Ok, that's an extreme example. I'm not saying this is 2007. I'm just saying that the Russell is a better indicator for whether or not a correction is over than the major indexes. Here's [a picture](https://i.redd.it/akd4iqraj5u61.jpg) of the NASDAQ and Russell during a minor correction in 2018. We're probably going into something a bit more like that.

It's even more likely that we're in the clear. As long as market news remains bullish, we should see nothing worse than normal market fluctuations.

But watch for bad market data.

If there's no crash, which I'm assuming will be the case, I'm afraid that this is the conclusion that we're steaming toward.

And this is why one of the comments that I saw about the ""Trump market"" is pretty lulz worthy. I got more involved in May that year, and in that month NDX lost 9%. It had me nervous because of one of my positions, but I was able to settle down (of course, at that moment, I didn't know that what I said was going on happened).

Netflix is #13 in the Nasdaq-100, which is big enough to be an influence, and it caused a bunch of other stocks to react in January with it at the same time, only positively that time.

why wouldn't it do it again, even if it didn't go a good way?

Now perhaps we'll sleep on it, wake up tomorrow, and decide that dumping the stronger FAANG companies because of Netflix reporting a slowdown in subscribers is stupid, but I'm guessing QQQ will lag tomorrow (it actually didn't today, .IXIC was the worst performer of the big three because of small caps...again, but QQQ/NDX was about .20% higher than them), and with the way things are going, there won't be anything to cover it up because smalls are broken and the Dow needs to at the very least pull back some."

2021-04-20 10:03:17,stocks,T and VZ or just one of the two?  I have more conviction towards VZ since I use them and just use T as a cheap dividend stock to hold onto.  Thoughts?

2021-04-20 11:29:46,stocks,"I'm at a crossroads right now. On one hand, I want to convert my APD leaps to shares because I feel like overleveraged on options, but on the other hand, it's on a good run right now, despite the whole market being down, which makes me think that institutions think it will beat earnings (Its got like 97% institutional ownership). Not sure what the play is"

It has been a bad bet so far, but with NFLX announcing at market close, the Chilevision buy, Rakuten partnership, and numbers suggesting Paramount+ has seen good uptake on Android I'll take the chance to average down another dollar.

They're trading below 1 P/S. It makes zero sense unless people think the company's business is in freefall and I don't think that at all."

2021-04-20 16:11:27,stocks,"Let’s say I buy a stock and I make $1,000 profit. Then I sell, regret it and immediately buy back in the same stock. Then it drops and I lose those $1,000. I still have to pay taxes on that first 1k even if I made no money in the end, right?"

2021-04-20 19:40:41,stocks,Sorry I am new to this still but I was thinking of buying some NDAQ but I’m not sure I fully understand it. Is it just another etf stock? Also why do I see that the stock is green when mostly everything else is in the red today? Thank you.
2021-04-20 14:36:55,stocks,I'll buy two tickets to that show to help offset your losses

It's pretty clear that the market is almost entirely disconnected from what happens in the real world."
2021-04-20 08:37:14,stocks,Yup. Thought I could “buy the dip” out of it but that’s not happening. Just hope we can go green eventually.
2021-04-20 09:29:49,stocks,I made particularly bad buys so couple of years for me.

2021-04-20 12:11:30,stocks,You're welcome.
2021-04-20 11:21:21,stocks,"I bought yesterday and sold 10 minutes into today. It worked, but not enough to offset my long holds dying."

2021-04-20 11:26:16,stocks,"To be fair, MSFT is 1% off of ATH. Not exactly a dip.

Just because their fundamentals didn't change, doesn't mean their valuation can't or won't."

I feel like I should sell, stop the bleeding, buy back later when the knife finally hits the ground...but also accepting that loss sucks"
2021-04-20 13:11:33,stocks,"Good conclusion in general, but remember that there are some brothers out there who invested in ARK and clean energy ETFs at their ATH who bled a lot too."
2021-04-20 13:27:06,stocks,You can also buy etf at their peaks.
2021-04-20 13:09:19,stocks,Yup I feel ya

2021-04-20 10:50:02,stocks,"It's earnings season. Everybody is scared, but when earnings are good, they'll buy in again, and the market will probably fly higher if I had to guess. We're in the middle of a power trend, and there's yet to be a sign that this will stop"
2021-04-20 11:41:44,stocks,"PENN's share price did +1800% in the last 12 months with a -32% revenue decline year-over-year. That 18x share price was never justified in any way shape or form. Like holy shit, who didn't see a correction coming? It was one of the most overvalued stocks in the market, literally, name another one that did 18x but declined -32% in revenue. With PENN going down, things are starting to make sense again."
2021-04-20 15:08:00,stocks,same here. If i could read I'd be worried.

2021-04-20 09:47:00,stocks,"I hope so but it stayed at this $135 level for quite a while after dropping from 144 after earnings -- before the tech correction/bond yields started. I remember we were all frustrated because the rest of the market kept going to ATH and AAPL just stayed flat at 135 all of Feb. On the plus side, it also took AAPL a bit longer to join the downward trend while everything else started tanking."

2021-04-20 17:07:39,stocks,DIS may get dragged down a little along with other sub services but shouldn’t matter to much to the market at large
2021-04-20 16:59:24,stocks,Why would Netflix drag down the market? Streaming services are now our macroeconomic indicators?
2021-04-20 17:32:56,stocks,Here with you brother. Average cost 19.99 😭
2021-04-20 17:40:28,stocks,yes . Average at 12.51$ 250shares. Hoping for a nice bounce
2021-04-20 17:39:49,stocks,"Where do you see 9mil?

I'm seeing 6.2 mil expected. 

Either way, for a high growth tech stock this does raise eyebrows. It's high price was only justified with high growth."

2021-04-20 07:26:27,stocks,"Last few weeks were great if you had blue chip or second tier stocks. This is discouraging though, especially consider the 10 year bond will keep going up this year and freaking people out of their positions."

2021-04-20 12:02:11,stocks,"It's earnings season. Volatility should be expected. Once we're over this hurdle, the markets will grow. People like to sell just before earnings to lower their risk if the company has poor results, with intentions of buying back in after the release"
2021-04-20 12:00:59,stocks,"Im thinking sell off from ATHs in combination with all the fuckery the banks are caught up in with that guy who had like 20 billion in swaps that he defaulted on. Pretty sure most of the insurance agencies didn't renew and the banks haven't disclosed how bad their losses are yet other than a few saying ""only"" 3-5 billion. At least that's what's driving the banking sector selloff and I have to imagine they're moving a lot of money around because of it."
2021-04-20 12:02:01,stocks,"We had crazy run last week. Look at spy and qqq charts. Now it's correcting but it's a bit worse and faster than i thought.

2021-04-20 13:04:55,stocks,"I suppose it's good to have dry powder. Stocks are high, crypto is high. People are talking about the dollar and other currencies losing their value. I can't see, in my situation, buying real estate. What else is good to buy, precious metals, bonds, anything else?"
2021-04-20 13:44:14,stocks,"I'd sell TSLA and keep AAPL, maybe move to another blue chip?"
2021-04-20 14:43:47,stocks,I would sell TSLA and keep AAPL (fundamentals)
2021-04-20 13:51:05,stocks,The number amount isnt important. What's the percentages?
2021-04-20 13:43:32,stocks,I would wait until TSLA gets closer to 800 again.
2021-04-20 13:41:42,stocks,Are you diversified? Should keep some in both if you ask me.
2021-04-20 13:44:17,stocks,"Depends on your strategy and outlook. Can’t really time the market, but it’s good to have some liquidity when the market dips. Personally I’d long both stocks. You could sale portions of what you hold and have long holding and some liquidity."
2021-04-20 16:17:37,stocks,In my experience bad earnings drop lower the day after than in after hours

2021-04-20 11:42:34,stocks,"I think that technically a stock has a value of 1 penny, kind of like a coupon at a store. A handful of burnouts in the dotcom bubble had their last sales at $0.01 ."
2021-04-20 11:54:17,stocks,"If it goes bankrupt, even chapter 11, you'll likely never see that money again and your broker might charge you a ""reorganization fee"". So you're out 30 or 40 bucks automatically"
2021-04-20 08:47:22,stocks,well it's not a definite indicator but the premarkets have been red pretty much all over.

2021-04-20 14:51:35,stocks,"You play a dangerous game trying to bounce in and out of stocks that you consider ""long term"". If you believe DKNG is a long-term hold right now then you are likely better off averaging down if you have the conviction and capital available or just holding and waiting out the storm, trying to time short term movements especially on a volatile stock is just gambling."
2021-04-20 14:48:41,stocks,"If you sell and it dips into the 40s, then sure, that was a good move.

If you sell and it only rebounds from here, you're going to buy back in at an even bigger loss.

If you plan on holding it long term, why sell? If anything, average down if it gets into the 40s."
2021-04-20 14:48:57,stocks,">DKNG 

Sometimes its better to sell it at loss and re-buy with cheaper price and re-gain your loss"
2021-04-20 14:48:19,stocks,what was your plan when you bought it at 60.50
2021-04-20 17:14:48,stocks,"If it's a long term hold for you, generally stick with that unless something changed. 

However, do you have any realized gains you would like to offset with losses? Do you think DKNG will trade sideways or down for 30 days? If so, selling becomes more attractive.

It's always a risk, but I sold a bunch of tech stocks in March at a loss to offset some huge gains from January. All those stocks are still below where I sold, which worked out beautifully. Now I can deduct the loss and repurchase at a lower price. This usually doesn't work though.

However, the ability to deduct the current loss (if desired) is kind of a hedge against it climbing back up some during the 30 days. This works because the loss will be a short-term loss but then if you rebuy and hold, when you sell it will be a long-term gain. 

Just be aware that the price will likely spike above your sell price for at least a short period of time. Whatever you do, make up your mind and stick to it. Changing your mind with daily swings is a recipe for losing a lot of money."
2021-04-20 17:19:56,stocks,"Do you have 100+ shares? If so, covered calls can be an effective strategy here if you are still bullish, but not in the short term. 

The main risk is that you might lose your shares below your cost basis. I like CCs because they make me commit to a decision. If I decide I want to sell at a certain price, I'm now getting paid to do so. Sure, it sucks when the price rockets past the strike, but with careful timing and selling calls at a low delta, the risk is pretty small."
2021-04-20 11:43:36,stocks,Really? Feels like it's been dipping for quite a bit more than a few weeks by now.

2021-04-20 16:33:53,stocks,"The other answers are correct, but don't forget about wash sales. If you buy again within 30 days, the loss is not deductible. However, the cost basis will be increased when you buy to account for the loss, so when you eventually sell again, the loss will be included.

If you absolutely want to deduct a loss from a sale, make sure to wait 30 days before buying again. It's not usually that important during the year, but is critically important in Dec-Jan. Somebody here made 200k last year in realized gains but then lost that amount in realized losses in December. They then repurchased the stock in early January and now owe taxes on 200k in profits but can't deduct the loss until the following year. Don't do this."
2021-04-20 16:14:51,stocks,"If you sell the stock again and make -$1000 it should get subtracted from your profit.
But if you hold, yes, you will have to pay taxes for the $1000.
(But take it with a grain of salt, I'm from Germany and things might be different at your place)"
2021-04-20 16:16:34,stocks,No. You don’t need to pay taxes if you gain and lose money in the same financial year. For suppose you made $1000 in the financial year 2019 and you lost $1000 in the financial year 2020 then you will pay 2019 taxes for $1000 you made in that year. In 2020 taxes you can claim $1000 loss.

2021-04-20 14:24:45,stocks,"Hi. If the market crashed 50% tomorrow I’d be incredibly concerned about a 50% fall in a single day so probably wouldn’t buy anything at all haha. Jokes aside though, let’s say there was a 50% fall over the span of about a month, roughly similar to the COVID crash of March last year, I wouldn’t focus too much on the % crash, but rather the prices of the stocks I want to buy. I have calculated what I believe to be the intrinsic values of those stocks and will simply buy at a point where they are at a fair margin of safety. So the thought of “maybe I shouldn’t try to catch a falling knife” or “what if I wait for another 15%” wouldn’t cross my mind. I’d simply just focus on the prices of the individual stocks and buy when they hit my target point of entry. As for how much of my free cash I’d invest, I’m fairly young and can afford to take risk so I’d probably invest all of the money I have set aside for stocks, or at least 90% of it. This may not be for everyone though, manage your own risk accordingly."

2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Academic Research on Motley Fool **TLDR: We can all agree Motley Fool's advertising is shit, but Academic Research seems to suggest their track record holds up to scrutiny. They focus on smaller stocks and holding them, which can be replicated, though research is difficult for some smaller companies.**

It seems to be a recurring discussion theme which /r/stocks visits, and everytime people who've never had anything to do with Motley Fool, and have never looked past their shitty clickbait ads always make claims like Motley Fool is as good as flushing your money down a sink. Or Motley Fool is a scam.

Now disclosure, I've never used their premium service, but I wanted to go beyond what potato123 on /r/stocks claims, and decided to do a cursory search on it.

[Turns out there's a research paper comparing the Fool's performance to the S&P 500.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%27s_Stock_Advisor)

The main findings from it can be summarized as below:

**Average Monthly Returns from 2002-2016:**

**Motley Fool Picks: 1.13%**

**Picks based on IBES recommendations: 1.21%**

**S&P 500: 0.48%**

So while the fool doubled the S&P500, it was beaten by IBES recommendations (which most people should be able to access through their broker (atleast you can here in Australia)).

They tend to pick a lot more smaller market caps though, which is why the IBES recommended matched portfolio comes out similar, since holding larger companies has underperformed finding smallcaps and holding them long.

In summary, Motley Fool does seem to be good at identifying the ones outside the mainstream, but if you have the background/experience, you may be able to get similar outperformance when investing in smallcaps and holding. The hurdle ofcourse is finding these, and having the research into them."
2021-04-20 07:41:12,stocks,I think that quite a few people hold a pick for a few months and if it has a bad return then they blame whoever gave them the information. The key is playing the long game which most newer investors including myself have a hard time seeing. That's what any reputable information source would be. Their picks aren't claiming they'll blow up tomorrow...
2021-04-20 08:17:23,stocks,"motley fool gives smaller cap stocks to buy and hold. as in, hold for 5 years at least, to let the earnings growth compound.

average reddit investor gets frustrated if their stock is not +10% within at least 2 weeks. this is the problem. different mindset

i have looked at a lot of their stock picks and most are pretty good, if a bit typical (they like tech stuff). my only criticism of motley fool is that:

1. their forums were made in 1996 at the dawn of internet and never updated. 2) they shill their services a lot"

- the matched sample is random based on market cap and book equity within the same industry, I would want to see matches on other dimensions to better pick comparable firms.   
- ibes sample excludes firms that fool picked, so you aren't actually testing to see if they are better at recommending over other analysts.  
- their tests on alpha are against zero which is correct to see if an alpha exists, but should be done against the matched and ibes to see if there is difference. No mention about how the errors were corrected.    
- the event day study could suggest that you have to be in before they recommend, but some gains going out 5 days if you miss out on 0 day returns.   
- they mention that the long term buy and hold are weakly significant. Testing value weight and equal weight is standard practice which wasn't DONE. Would like to see some outlier testing done to see if the results aren't driven by a handful of good picks.    

At the end of the day the paper is okay, lots of work still to be done. Maybe there is something, but I wouldn't put much weight behind it."

all this applies to stocks that are ripping upward as well, but you dont notice it as much because investors tend to be long on equities, so it helps the confirmation bias :)

Why ARKG? Why do you think genomics would be a good long term hold? Can you explain genomic technology to a toddler before they get bored? What is your current position on the ethical debate around such technology? Where is it in the process of getting development/approval? How do you think people will respond to a class issue regarding this new treatment? Keep in mind actively managed funds tend to do worse than an index fund over the long run. 


> ARKK 


Why ARKK? Historically actively managed funds to worse than an index fund over the long term. If I remember right Cathie has had this fund more than 12x in size, it’s harder to manage more money. Also why do you think investing in unprofitable “innovation” is a good strategy? Every time there’s innovation, it’s followed by a boom and bust, do you think Cathie will be able to time the market and get out before busts? Are you willing to pay 0.75% for potential years of bad results? 


> ICLN 


Growth is more than priced into ICLN, even after its now down 30% from its ATH. Now it’s faced with multiple issues as people bail out of this ETF. One of which is that the green energy utility companies have very high costs and thrive by taking out loans, so they don’t really have bubble potential outside of narrative driven rallies. Not to mention most of their holdings are still ridiculously overvalued so they’d need to see extreme growth if you want to see any type of returns. 


https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=ICLN,ARKK



You can also see how ICLN/ARKK have exploded in popularity due to their returns, while before March 2020 they had no interest.

I wanted to see what people thought of whitbread PLC? for those who don’t know it’s based in the Uk and is most commonly known for owning premier inn and beefeater.

My thoughts are that this might be a good play this summer, with another year of the uk population travailing around the UK more than going abroad. 
I also believe beefeater and premier inn to be relatively low cost / mid quality. Which I think is a combination that will be attractive to many tourists and uk holiday goers, who may be trying to save.

Costa also was under Whitbread, before being sold to Coca Cola for 3.9 billion in 2019. I used to work at a costa, so I have a slight confirmation bias to whitbread, which is annoying. I really wish they still had them lol.

bringing this into the simulation makes it hard for me to look at something and say ""yes 100% this seens like a good buy rn"" but this would also be the case if I could only buy stocks in rl at this time"
2021-04-20 17:27:20,stocks,"Just as a counter perspective, I love TA and have actually had green days consecutively for the last 1.5 weeks. Yeah. In this market. It's not big gains, but it's consistent and I only do TA based on RSI, Support/resistance readings, and trading leveraged index ETFs (e.g. TQQQ, SQQQ, etc).

It's ""tarot"" for a lot of people because it's not easy or quick (so it gets written of as ""voodoo crap"" because, simply, almost no one takes the time or dedication necessary to learn how to train and refine their TA skills enough to actually get good at it). I had to pour tons of hours and time into practicing, learning more, and practicing more -- especially in the worst market days (that last part is super important so you can trade well in both a bull and bear market).

I also agree though that simulations are crap, but because they never actually simulate how low volume stocks are manipulated, and how your trades will literally move against you *because* you put them up on the tape for other traders to read. I ran a simulation and turned 100k into over 1.5 million in a day because I just yoloed the entire 100k into a running low-float stock. But in reality? If you tried doing that, so many traders and algos would take you to town and tank the price as soon as you bought a lot that size. Runs don't mature when you pump the price like that because honestly, if most people saw the price jump 10-20% because of a single, massive whale purchase, who *wouldn't* take profits?

My personal advice - since it's a no-risk simulation, if you want to just win (and don't care about learning about how to actually trade well), throw 50-100% into low-float momentum plays (best if under $15ish to maximize % gain) and let them ride for ~10-15 minutes up past your average before hoping out and onto a different low-float runner while the one you left cools off."

2021-04-20 17:38:52,stocks,"what's hard for me to umderstand with TA is... what is it based on? why would resistance levels work? is it human psychologie? does it just work because eveyone does it and because of that it works? I never tried to learn TA maybe that's why I don't know but maybe you have a good answere.

For your strategy - that was one of my first thoughts aswell to just daytrade on small companies but I can only buy and sell at the next closing price so daytrading or timing the purchase really is impossible"
2021-04-20 17:57:35,stocks,"TA is different for everyone. For me I stick to simply reading RSI, Ttm_squeeze, and the MacD. And yeah you're right -- it works because lots of both daytraders and algos align their buy/sell signals based off of TA so it's pretty much a self-fulfilling prophecy type thing (but I mean, it exists so...why not use it?).

Resistance and support levels are really dependant on what frequency you're looking at, but for example look at SQQQ's chart from today. Almost everytime it hit 11.23 it'd rebound back down toward 11.08ish. So what I did today was take an entry position in SQQQ anytime it'd get near 11.08, then just keep buying more the closer it got (or even when it'd dip past 11.08). Then by the time it finally rebounded back up to resistance (11.23) from support (11.08) I'd flatten my position and sell most/all my shares on the way up and actually take an opposite position in TQQQ the closer SQQQ got to 11.23.

Rinse and repeat each day. I also make sure to only do it in small lots of 100 or less shares each time because everytime I'd try taking larger positions at once, I'd almost always get taken advantage of so I've had to learn to stealth-build my entire position over time.

As far as the restriction they gave you for buying/selling at the next closing price...that's going to be extremely hard to get a read on in the current market. In fact the reason I've been able to do so well is because my fundamental principle is to never hold a position overnight (it's less of a gamble which, yeah means I miss out on some great potential gap ups overnight, but it also means I've mitigated an absolute TON of loss over the last 2 months).

Given that restriction I'd say look for stocks that are seeing big over-reactive dumps on one day, then buy them for the next day. I played NIO and TSLA like this for a while. Whenever NIO would dive by more than 5-7% in a day, I'd buy several shares at the lowest possible point I could find that day and just wait for a day or two for it to re-correct itself into the other direction. The redder the better. But als:, in this market, if you have green on the table, take it and find the next play. Don't play the same thing more than once unless you're doing intraday oppositional pairs (like the SQQQ/TQQQ I was referring to earlier).

Edit: I should mention I use a completely different strategy and hold a lot of things overnight in a steady, bull market. But this is not one right now - no matter what SPY or VTI may look like. The market is showing fractures and extremely irregular movement all the way from OTC pennies to large-cap stocks."

2021-04-20 02:21:22,stocks,"I'm with Fidelity and invested currently at 70% FZROX and 30% FZILX. Will likely add small cap exposure next year (I'm already maxed out the $6k contribution this year).

Best advise would be to not withdraw anything from your IRA. Let compound interest work for you long term. But there is no penalty to withdraw your contributed amount. There is a penalty if you withdraw earnings (i.e. it's a 10% early penalty plus income tax rate).

Big downside is if you withdraw from your Roth IRA, you cannot contribute backwards such as going back to 2020 if current year is 2021. This will make you miss out on years of compound growth."

2021-04-20 07:51:51,stocks,"The Roth IRA and 401(k) are powerful wealth building tools sir, that can assist you in building your wealth over time. I understand we are living in a time where you are flooded with misinformation and you see any and everybody bragging about ridiculous returns from their investments. 
Maybe you might be able to as well, but there is no strategy to do that. As such, no professional will give you such an advice. 
I’m a licensed tax professional and this is financial advice. As much as possible, try to resist the urge to participate in the madness of the crowd with money you are putting into your 401(k) and IRA. In 2021, you are able to contribute $19,500 in a 401(k) plan (assuming your source of income is earned through an employer) and another $6000 to an IRA. At least, be extra careful with that $25,500 you earn each year because you know more than anyone the time and effort you put to earn that money. Invest that $25,500 in a Total US stock market Index fund and maybe a Total International Index Fund if you want exposure to businesses outside the United States.
After that, do whatever you need to do to make some extra income and see if you’re lucky enough to make some Yolo bets or pick some winning stocks and make ridiculous returns, so we can all be jealous of you 😂😉

(The questions you asked about IRA withdrawals and buying individual stocks are questions you will get answers to if you are serious about it and wish to learn. Maybe it will be beneficial to hire a financial advisor and the cost is justified if it prevents you from making costly mistakes. Good luck to you, I wish you the very best in all your endeavors!)"

Basically, you can only contribute to an IRA if you have earned income and each year you can only contribute a max amount. There is more to it and if you get the chance I suggest you read up more about it."

Also have to pay attn to if you are saving elsewhere or if the gap in the ira will be felt in retirement or not."

I'm trying to keep a mix of long and short exposure too with my stock picks and its been working well for a couple weeks."
2021-04-20 08:05:36,stocks,"For someone who sounds nervous because they hear the term “All time high” and I’m going to assume $28,000 is a large sum of money (which it is), your investment goal should/ must be in something that protects your principal and provides you a reasonable rate of return. 
Most of us have a few choices: long-term equity (popularly called stocks), long-term debt instruments (commonly known as bonds) and short-term debt instruments (commonly known as short-term treasury bonds, cash and cash equivalents). Then there are others like real estate which allow you to use leverage/ borrow money for a down payment, etc. 
We’ll keep things simple, I’m assuming you’re here because you want to invest the $28,000 and you’re overwhelmed because you are getting a lot of information that makes no sense. 
The best strategy sir, is to dollar cost average: which is to buy at regular intervals, maybe every week or every two weeks or every month.

Nobody knows what the highest point is for stocks or if/when it will all fall, and waiting around is no guarantee you will be able to buy at a cheaper price tomorrow. For your peace of mind and making sure you get your share of return from owning businesses/ equity/ stocks, buy at regular intervals and hold. Keep things simple, and enjoy life with your friends and family. You will live a long and prosperous life if you focus on your health and the quality of your experiences. 
Don’t stress over the market being at all time highs or stare at ticker prices all day thinking you’ll get a good deal by drawing some lines on a price history chart or asking for advice from others who know just as much as you about the market.

Good luck to you! 🙋🏾‍♂️"

VOO has every stock in SCHD, so that's a redundancy. I'd drop one or the other, and add small/mid fund to round it out.  

>I looked up the sectors across the Market

VOO already has exposure to every sector in the market. you don't need to have a fund or ETF that touches on every sector. 

I also think the ARK funds are gonna pop like a balloon. anything that over-heated tends to cool off."

All you need is VOO or VTI. That’s as basic as it gets...or if you want it more fancy like you can add small caps or swap VOO for IWB to get access to mid caps. Then throw in VXUS for international. So the least you need is 1 index fund, and at most maybe 5. 


Trying to pick sectors is almost akin to picking stocks, meaning it’s slightly better than picking stocks but still statically your choices will fail to beat a simple index fund."

&#x200B;

Account Value = 9,804.32

Stock Value = 8,925.22

Cash Value = 879.10

Total Invested = 8,898.53 of which 3,474.50 was invested today (4/19)

&#x200B;

It would seem based on this that I have am only at a total gain of 8,925.22 - 8,898.43 = 26.79 whole dollars or 0.30% return on my total investment... 

However, if I look at my Gains column and add up the individual gains per stock with everything currently sitting in the green, even if only slightly, it shows a total gain of 214.04 or a 2.40% ROI which is still low I understand even without the money I put in today in an attempt to average up and add other positions. 

Shouldn't my Stock Value then equal Total Invested + Total Gains per stock putting it at 8,898.53 + 214.04 = 9,112.57? Then Account Value would be at 9,991.67 after you add the Cash Value.

I keep 3 to 4 months worth in a money market account (a little better interest than just regular savings).

CD's if I had to break them would be a small penalty.  Then I've started putting money into stocks.

Remember with stocks you have t+2 before you can access the money.  Sale a stock on Monday, it will settle on Wednesday, then you can plan on submitting a request to send the cash to your local bank.  Depending on the bank and the amount of money, could be held for 7 days before you have access to it.

From there figure out if you want stocks that will go up in value.  Or if you want dividends, or if you want to try and find stocks that will give dividends and go up in value.  Lots of people will give you lots of idea's on what you should buy.  Watch, and listen, then do your research and once you buy hope it works out."

I mainly go off youtubers who are able to back up their opinions and also parts of the market I know more about (IT for myself), but I also check marketwatch.com before I buy anything, it gives rating based on market analyst s' opinion. 

Second thing is to diversify your portfolio as much as possible to minimize risk. I have around 40 different positions in many different sectors.

Finally, just keep buying and holding, it sounds so basic but historically the market will always go up over long periods of time."

&#x200B;

$CBSH - I think a better deal is possible but if it takes off I won't be surprised. Gorgeous channel, I just want a slightly better deal to finally enter it.

&#x200B;

$EVH  - We are currently RIGHT in support and trend, this could be a great low risk, high reward channel up play becoming an ascending triangle.

&#x200B;

$FSLY - One of my favorite long term holds had a great pull back, perfect opportunity to enter a trade you may hold 3 - 6 months. With a stop loss this is a great pick.

&#x200B;

$GRNQ - I will not be paying more than $1.85. I think we can get down there, if I miss it - so be it - but this is a great value here.

&#x200B;

$IIPR - We may dip quite a bit more, but this is like $HEAR - we are right there to enter and make some good moves. Gorgeous triangle.

&#x200B;

$LPRO - One of my best plays 2 weeks ago, 20% in 2 days. I want to do it again, great reward, low risk - and a beautiful setup. I love it.

&#x200B;

$NARI - Lower highs and higher lows, we have a beautiful triangle forming, maybe an ascending triangle. Already taking off because I call DINGERS.

&#x200B;

$SEDG - $DUST 2.0? Looking great for this trend and support, I mean what is the risk? 3%, reward? 15 - 20%? Love it.

&#x200B;

$SYF  - Fantastic value on an ascending play right near support. Super easy read and super low risk here."

2021-04-19 21:13:29,stocks,"I’d say success isn’t beating the market for 1 year, but for many years. I think a good timeline to define success in the markets would be at least beating the market over 15 years."
2021-04-19 23:01:25,stocks,"Two ways of looking at success in my mind: absolute and relative success. 

Absolute: am I able to safely invest money into the market while affording my current costs, and will the rate of return cover my expected costs in the future? 

Relative: do I beat the total market benchmark? 

Absolute doesn’t require a rate of return equal to the market. If I’m not getting it, though, point #2 reminds me I should probably just go that route."
2021-04-19 23:11:14,stocks,"Been at it for 15+ years so I've accumulated and seen quite a bit of market drama to know if a company event is short term noise or systemic. I haven't done much indepth research anywhere comparable to the professional analysts but just go by simple metrics, business story,  simple review of the financial statements and reading a few analyst reports. 

So my yardstick for success depends on the individual holding for me and rating it as a success or not based on various observations with respect to that holding. 

If I did better or close to the returns of each individual holdings vs S&P500 during the holding period  with a minimum of 5 years. I don't care about months to a year to two to three year returns. Returns in short timelines might feel good or bad but it doesn't move me much to think about it unless it becomes a multibagger in a short time or it tanks significantly due to systemic issues. 

It'll mean a lot more if the market sentiment at the time of buying was against the crowd.  

Having a bunch of multibaggers over the years is a clear measure of a  successful outcome for me as there's nothing that can beat owning 3x and higher multibaggers after a few years. 

It'll mean a lot lot more if I kept  buying again and again as prices kept falling or stayed flat...and some staying flat for year and years at a stretch.and underperforming significantly. Now the flip side is that much of that growth was from mostly  PE expansion or discounts metrics that I otherwise would have thought was a bad sign. But if wall st. says that makes the company more valuable, who am I to argue. 

Few success buys were when I realized the company  has a long term story to keep growing and didn't wait for a pull back and I just bought it. Many years down the line, those companies have not just outperformed but became multibaggers and even gave out dividends. 

Few success buys are when you buy companies not for growth but for stability + slow growth and they end up outperforming and keep giving out increasing dividends every year. The dividends start piling up and have a life of their own to add to your portfolio once they get to five figures. 

Another metric for success is when I have a position or a bunch of stocks from a sector that tanks significantly compared to the overall market  but the portfolio didn't get hit and might have even held up. This let me know that I was sufficiently diversified."
2021-04-20 01:10:52,stocks,"I (sort of - huge caveat below) ultimately decided I was most interested in ensuring i didn't underperform the market, so I switched strategies a couple years ago to holding mostly ETFs. At that point, I had several years experience in the market and saw diversification at work - some stocks gained while others had losses. If you have a sufficiently diversified portfolio, you're not likely to beat the market over time. And if you don't have an adequately diversified portfolio, then you could get lucky, but you're taking on uncompensated risk. When I was investing in individual stocks, I would try to compare to the S&P as a check from time to time, and I think I did beat the market over that time period, but that wasn't enough to convince me to keep with that strategy. 

Now the caveat. I enjoyed trading too much to just put my money in ETFs and forget it. So I now have the net value of my portfolio invested in ETFs (at least that's the strategy going forward, I have an individual stock I haven't sold for mainly tax reasons), then I play with stocks by buying and selling on margin. Anything I make by buying on margin is just a bonus. [Not a recommendation to start trading on margin.]"
2021-04-20 02:34:42,stocks,Currently so long as I beat the Banks interest rate I'm happy enough
2021-04-20 11:28:57,stocks,"Success means I stuck to my investment strategy and exit plan (that still may mean I lost money, but that I kept emotion out of it).

And ngl, if you've been investing just this last year, then you are soaring on a high and probably didn't see much red. You're hopped up on Mountain Dew sorta speak and haven't yet come off the sugar high. But you will. And you'll reassess your entire strategy (hopefully you have one). Investing during a bull gives false confidence to most new investors.

So check yourself. Develop an overall investment strategy (calculate your own cash flow, budget your expenses, invest into retirement accounts first, and then whatever is left over, commit to a DCA approach with your ""wealth management account."") Figure all that out and how much you can invest monthly, and then you've got the basics of where your cash flow goes. I'd actually suggest opening a managed brokerage account first and keep a small percentage to play with on your own, as you learn.

Once you develop your own strategy and parameters of how you day trade (I.e. you should know your exit plan before you ever make a trade), then stick to it. That's success for me.

Keeping emotion out of the equation is success. And the best way to do that is DCA without fault and to learn rebalancing and repositioning trends that you'll see occur within your managed brokerage account."

2021-04-19 22:44:01,stocks,"I would argue high risk works out better in the long term with appropriate diversification and long term investing horizon.

High volatile stocks like small cap growth can have some really tough years and are considered high risk.. but in the long term they outperform."
2021-04-19 22:48:06,stocks,Yeah... I tend to agree with you.
2021-04-19 20:18:24,stocks,"I love the optimism, and I share it too! However I can't help but wonder how I am doing compared to other similar investors to have a measure of my success."
2021-04-19 20:08:00,stocks,"I see your point, and I do celebrate the wins even if they feel rather undeserved. 

So what time frame would you normally consider, perhaps an industry standard that people go by. Quarterly, annually? If a rookie trader gets a job at an investment firm how long would they wait before they could claim any success? Perhaps success can only be measured in realized gains?"
2021-04-19 20:30:07,stocks,"I guess the ""period of years"" thing is what I am getting at. I think many new investors like myself can easily get big heads with the easy success of this year. I'm just not sure at what point you can stop calling it beginners luck."

(I had to google multibaggers)  
I just don't fully understand the timeline you talk about. You say you measure the success of positions over years and nothing beats holding a 3x multibagger over 5 years. But you wouldn't consider a 10x bag over 3 months just as good if not better?"
2021-04-20 01:26:08,stocks,I think this is closest to how I feel moving forward. I assumed my growth was mostly luck up to this point and going forward I should expect to be more conservative about the majority of my money with a fun fund to indulge.
2021-04-19 20:18:47,stocks,Honestly I enjoy trading. I like watching the market Chanel. I could probably have better results if I just invested in things like voo. Even if I don’t beat voo but make money I’m happy with it as long as I’m still enjoying it and having fun.
2021-04-19 22:48:09,stocks,"I think good risk is a high likelihood the stock can fall sharply or even go to near zero, but also the possibility that it can 5-50x.

 If you diversify with many very good small and micro cap businesses some may go to zero but will be easily out weighed by 5x, 10x maybe even 100x. Hold very long until the BUSINESS no longer executed or the thesis fails."
2021-04-19 22:45:31,stocks,"Small caps as a whole outperform, however this is compensation for the extra risk that they hold. Since small cap stocks have more of a risk of failure than large cap stocks, whether it is deserved or not, they require a higher discount rate to convince investors to hold them."

2021-04-19 20:11:01,stocks,"Well I guess it’s down to expectation, I went short term profit for the 20% profit using margin but then switched to long term investments no margin.  Then I guess weekly or even daily profits but now, I’m accumulating for 5-10 years as I see a greater benefit. 🙌💎"
2021-04-19 23:11:39,stocks,"If your timeframe is decades and you have a plan that you can stick to with holdings made of broadly diversified index funds, investing isn’t “risky”. Equities sure are risky assets, but time is on your side and index funds minimize uncompensated risk. Holding the global market gives you the whole equity premium without the idiosyncratic risk you’d have from holding individual names. Return isn’t guaranteed but I’d argue bonds are less safe than equities - oftentimes they don’t even outpace the inflation rate. Seems less safe for a long retirement than an equity allocation."
2021-04-19 23:57:49,stocks,"Well, last year was an anomoly for some of my buys. I have a few new buys from last year or slightly earlier  that have became multibaggers....these companies have good stories, good growth but they are priced many multiples of current revenue, have little or no net income (but they nice operating margins and operating income so the reason they don't have net income is because profits go back into the business for reinvestment or marketing to increase market share) and they have to keep growing in the double digits to meet lofty expectations of growth. Any slight upset and the share price can tank and if there's a macro event that affects their business, it could have a similar response to the Dotcom bubble bursting IMHO. Dotcom blue chip darlings like Cisco, Microsoft, EMC were priced similarly (though they had netincome) but the multiples were crushed after the dotcom bubble burst. It took Microsoft some 10+ years & starting a dividend to get back to it's 2000 high, EMC never did and neither did Cisco after all these years."
2021-04-19 22:49:21,stocks,Agreed! Small caps need diversification more than anything else
2021-04-19 22:58:18,stocks,"I think I am getting vocabed out of this!  
Over the past year I have at least 200% growth (not exactly sure how to calculate that) but I felt like most of it was either dumb luck or just picking stocks that were a third of their pre-covid levels and waiting for a bounce. I guess I am curious what a normal year looks like so I can set my expectations.   


I think the sickest part of trading is that you can see the upside of a tragedy. . ."
2021-04-19 20:23:16,stocks,Agreed. If I were to compare myself I would do to with VTI
2021-04-19 20:23:53,stocks,So if VTI has a return of 50% over the past year then that is the average of everyone's portfolio?
2021-04-19 23:16:15,stocks,Okay I get your point. But that doesn't seem like active investing anymore.
2021-04-19 22:51:13,stocks,"Something to note though, small cap indices have largely unperformed the market over the past few years. They have been shown to outperform in the long run (40-50 years) but I wouldn’t want to only own small caps."

2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Do you guys think that most corporations are actually loving that this covid crisis happened? Come to think of it, they finally had a justification for downsizing and they were able to retrench employees. They also got free money from the fed and the government. Most companies have been consistently beating earnings estimate since covid spread as people were given free money also to buy what they want while tech companies massively benefitted from the lockdowns. Even banks continue to report blow out earnings when most expected them to suffer. 

Lastly, the stock market euphoria that covid crisis caused resulted into companies being able to offer tons of additional shares at high prices to pay off debt or expand, market participants mostly didn't care and they just all absorbed the dilutions left and right, insiders were also very happy to sell at high prices. IPO and blank check mania also allowed companies to have ridiculously high valuations so they were able to raise large amount of funds."
2021-04-19 23:49:01,stocks,Oh so you're asking if company owners of companies who had their stocks artificially rise to unprecedented heights in an absurdly quick timeframe are happy about their newfound wealth despite the fact that most Americans have been fucked? Good question.

2021-04-20 02:23:04,stocks,Don’t speak for most but we started our business in Dec 2019. Ordered inventory based on those sales trends.

Loss of employees means loss of revenue and production capability. That means loss of money.

No company wants to downsize unless they are going through some kind of restructure. Companies want experienced workers. They hire entry level workers with the hope that they will stay with the company long-term and become very effective at their jobs and make the company more money. High turnover and the need to train large amounts of new employees can have lasting, negative effects on revenue."

LVMH is only US based, whereas LVMUY covers the whole brand of them globally, and is at a significantly higher price point. I'm still confused why people recommend to only get LVMH when in Europe and other places LVMHF does phenomenally well."
2021-04-20 12:21:57,stocks,LVMHF and LVMUY both peg to a Euro share of LVMH.  the LVMUY is a lot more liquid and is pegged to 1/5 of a share while the other one represents a whole share.  Pick the more liquid shares as LVMHF barely trades.

I started buying IBM in September right before the announcement of the spinoff and I was laughed out of the sub when I said I was bullish on this dinosaur. The acquisition of Red Hat, the promotion of Arvind Krishna (who lead the acquisition) to CEO, and now the spinoff of the legacy IT consulting business spell good things for the future of IBM. 

I'm impressed how quickly this $120b behemoth as been able to do a complete 180 from a dying IT business to a thriving cloud services and data analytics firm. They may never compete on the same level as Azure or AWS but the cloud services market is big enough that you don't need to compete with them to be successful. There's plenty of market to go around.

There's still a ways to go but the future is looking bright for IBM."
2021-04-19 20:03:35,stocks,I bought right after last quarter's earning miss.   But it was at $118.xx so having it at $137.xx with a nice dividend is a good thing.

2021-04-19 21:44:41,stocks,I’m an ex IBM’er of 6 years as of this year. The spin off business represents the largest profit margin businesses with and avg of 40% net profit. This is the services business IBM is known for and frankly has been their bread and butter. All your bullish points are right but it’s a bit of a gamble. Big ships don’t turn fast and IBM is a decade behind on cloud. I like the potential in AI and Quantum but they tend to spin their wheels in R&D. Look at Watson. The best thing Watson ever did was win Jeopardy 10 years ago. I want IBM to do well but cloud will be a very hard fight to win.

Nuclear war has forced the last survivors of humanity south towards antarctica where global warming has created the only livable landmass not smothered in radiation. One day a forlorn couple stumbles across a giant steel structure that was, presumably, buried in ice until the recent melt. The couple spends 3 months training a rookery of albatross to fly them to the top of the structure where a singular hatch juts into the empty skies. Upon opening the hatch, the couple is rocked by a blast of air from what they now know is a pressurized containment center. Inside they find the quickly disintegrating body of Steve Jobs who was, until the moment the pressure was released, alive with his brain powering the universal reality generator. The couple has just enough time to thank Jobs for his sacrifice before the reality generator shuts down and all of existence is erased. Thus ends Apple..and the world.

The Covid-19 pandemic shows us that the economy (more specifically stock market) can generally recover to ATH’s within a couple of years, even during the worst crises. When the next economic downturn occurs, what’s stopping people from just... buying the dip? Until there is the next crisis and the dip suddenly gets smaller because investors see it as a way to guarantee a stronger return, so they buy more.

2021-04-20 10:23:06,stocks,"because we as retail investor are a tiny portion of this monster called the market. If large investors don't like the risk/return and expected payoffs, they won't buy the dips. The dip in March 2020 recovered because the Fed announced that they will be buying more assets in the markets to provide liquidity to market participants. So the dip didn't stop dipping because everyone bought the dip, but rather the Fed was buying more and more assets, pushing interest rates down and also pushing investors to riskier assets.

The other thing to consider, is that this crisis is different to all previous crises, and will be different to future crises. If you remember at the beginning it was all doom and gloom, default rates with increase, companies will have a hard time to adjust etc. Turns out those predictions were wrong, but at the time no one knew things would turn out this way.

And if you think that markets can recover quickly, go check out a chart of the S&P500 from 2000-2015 and you'll see how long it actually takes to recover. Thank the Fed for acting so quickly and forcefully, otherwise we wouldn't be seeing these highs for another 5 years."

2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Let's imagine another '08. What do you do? Whether you choose to believe all the rumors circulating around that there's too much liquidity in the market, it's all a bubble, and a '08 style crash is near or not, let's imagine a hypothetical scenario in which you *do* believe that a market crash is likely to happen within a year. Let's also assume that the question applies to multiple different demographics:

1. You're a student, with not much of any assets to your name. You therefore don't have much leeway in terms of ""investing"" money, apart from perhaps a couple hundred bucks. However, you should be released onto the job market soon.
2. You're a family man(or woman), with a seemingly stable job. Perhaps you're renting, perhaps you own your family's apartment - In either case, you do have *some* savings, but have not yet invested much or any of them, for whatever reason - Perhaps they're meant for your kids' studies, and you're risk averse.
3. You're doing quite well for yourself, and have some assets invested in the stock market. While not providing a full wage's worth, the returns do permit you to finance your yearly or biyearly vacation.

The question now simply becomes: **In each scenario, what do you guys think the person in question should do to best hedge for themselves, under the belief of a coming crash? This question applies both to financials (Invest? In what?) as well as behavior (Get a different type of job?).**

For context, I personally don't believe that any imminent crash would have ripple effects of similar extent as '08, in part due to the regulation enacted post-crisis (Such as Dodd-Frank). However, any crash would be likely to at the very least exhibit similar short-term effects at the very least.

Although it does not matter much to the question, I believe that I do owe you some further context in regards to my ""own financial situation"", which should perhaps explain what motivated me to post this (Even though, again, this should not impact the question nor the answer): While I am one of those people hated on this sub for being fully invested both financially and emotionally in GameStop, my dad is not. He has *some* liquid money on the bank (No insane amounts, but an alright safety net. Although the definition of alright would probably depend on the person, and given the demographic frequenting this sub, my dad's amount is most likely on the lower end of your ""alright"" definition), owns his primary residence, and doesn't really have much of any other asset, whether stocks or something else.

2021-04-20 10:21:58,stocks,"This isn’t as true as people think. 

I operated on this belief for most of my trading life. In fact, i assume worse than this. That the news is often manipulative when it comes from the industry players and fake when it’s from news outlets just trying to get clicks with hysteria. 

 >>”Gell-Mann amnesia 

>>Michael Crichton coined the term Gell-Mann Amnesia effect to describe forgetting how unreliable a source is in one area when you trust it in another area.”

Meaning if you see a topic you know about, you will always see how the news gets the story wrong most of the time. But you assume it’s a fluke and they get it right on other topics.

So I’m fully indoctrinated ok? That said, there are academic studies that have disproved this. All news helps stocks prices. And the market actually doesn’t react as fast as we cynically expect. And this was before the acceleration of the domination of momentum and meme stocks. 

What we experience is impatience. Retail traders do buy at the near term peak and get front run on. But if they held past the next dip they would STILL out perform over the medium and long term! AND you can front run casual retail traders still by buying premarket and at open. So it’s really only on the horizon of news cycle discussion that they underperform. ie boomers are only down when it’s topical, and up over short, medium AND long term.

There was a post yesterday someone showed even Jim Cramer who we always bust on, has been killing it with picks over the same timeframes I’m describing. But we just laugh at the boomers buying the nearest peak and selling the nearest bottom. But the HODL boomers actually are crushing it. 

This has become more and more true now that retail traders are pushing momentum stocks for so long now.  This will likely revert soon, but trying to pick that top will drive you crazy and may break you. (Ask me how I know) 

Furthermore, on major bad news the market and algorithms don’t even know what to do for black swans. So if you think things through, there is often opportunities.

We knew there was a pandemic for weeks before the market reacted. The few biggest events of the year are like this.

Ps I want to mention reflexivity. What Soros calls the self fulfilling nature of stock prices actually pulling the values of the company with them in upward and downward cycles. This is contrary to most conventional stock theory, but you can see it play out in examples like GME"

Because they set expectations low, most companies ""beat"" earnings every single time - e.g. AAPL and MSFT both average ""beating"" by 15% or so. So when their earnings come out each quarter people are actually expecting them to ""beat"" by 15% or even more as a baseline - i.e. that amount of a beat is essentially ""priced in."" Additionally, forward guidance is arguably more important. 



So the short of it is, just because a company ""beats"" earnings doesn't mean the earnings were good. If the stock plummets after they report, then holders were obviously expecting more of a beat and were expecting better. Therefore, the earnings weren't ""good earnings"" in the eyes of most investors."

Stuff that I won’t ever have to sell and can just continue collecting the dividend for the foreseeable future.

to the contrary: 

>There is an abundance of empirical evidence which suggests that portfolios consisting of higher dividend yielding securities produce returns that are attractive relative to lower- yielding portfolios and to overall stock market returns over long measurement periods. ... 

>In their book, Triumph of the Optimists: 101 Years of Global Investment Returns Princeton University Press (2002), Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton examined the respective contributions to returns provided by capital gains and dividends from 1900 to 2000. They discovered that while year-to-year performance was driven by capital appreciation, **long-term returns were largely driven by reinvested dividends. In the chart below, they showed the cumulative contribution to return of capital gains and dividends in both the U.S. and the U.K. from 1900 to 2000. Over 101 years, they found that a market-oriented portfolio, which included reinvested dividends, would have generated nearly 85 times the wealth generated by the same portfolio relying solely on capital gains.**...

>In a more recent study, The Future for Investors, Crown Business, 2005, Jeremy Siegel, the noted finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, examined the performance of the component stocks of the Standard and Poor’s 500 Stock Index, ranked by dividend yield from 1957 to 2002. In his study, on December 31 of each year, the S&P 500 stocks were sorted into five quintiles ranked by dividend yield.

Strong companies which are performing well are more likely to offer good dividends, not the other way around like you are trying to say this study supports.

the comparison should always be ""does this outperform a whole market index"" - anything other than that isn't valid. Otherwise you end up in the ""I am comparing companies which are doing well that offer dividends to the average company"" which is well, having average performance. Do you by chance know what happens to ""high dividend yield stocks"" when they aren't well, performing well? they stop being high dividend yield stocks.

Id be more interested I'd they compared returns on the 20% highest yield vs 20% highest growth.

Considering taxes are paid on dividends I still favor growth over yield.

2021-04-20 01:46:34,stocks,"OK, I hear you. By all means, go ahead and do what you suggested. If I may suggest one thing, and this is somewhat anecdotal and you will need to see if it fits your personal risk tolerances and investing styles; when you are ""starting out"", don't over-diversify. Pick solid companies that you are comfortable with, but don't go finding 20 of them ""just because"". Diversification when it comes to dividend investing is for capital preservation more than aggressive growth."
2021-04-19 21:15:28,stocks,"Interesting. Also interesting you cite so many studies around early 2000s or late 90s. First off, paying a dividend is much less common than it was in the prior century. You can look up a variety of papers on that, and they conclude it’s not just a general acceptance of buying firms that don’t pay dividends, it’s that the perceived benefits of dividends (if they existed) have decreased over time. 

Secondly, dividends themselves are not the determining factor of returns. Fama and French examined dividend yield and concluded it had the smallest value premium in comparison to other value metrics. Essentially, the companies that pay dividends may have greater exposure to the underlying risk factors that explain the higher expected returns. The dividend itself isn’t a factor. 

I am confident that if you constructed a portfolio of non dividend paying stocks and another that consisted of only dividend paying stocks, but they had the same exposure to the known risk factors, the total returns would largely be the same minus a normal amount of variance. 

Dividend payers and growers with long track records of doing so aren’t necessarily more exposed to the risk factors that Fama and French have identified. You would have a higher expected return picking a company that does in direct comparison with a company less exposed but pays a dividend.

To recap: dividends don’t explain returns. Dividend payers may have greater exposure to the known risk factors which would explain the performance. All else equal, a non dividend payer and a dividend payer both with equal exposure to risk factors would be expected to have the same total return.

Edit: I’m sure this conclusion is intuitive. But also consider, if we were to play stock picker for a second, the companies that have high yields but very low total returns. You see them mentioned all the time for income investors as attractive options. I’d rather take VTI at that point."

Is it going into investments? If so why doesn’t this show as a cost and reduce their net income to the dividend + cash increase? Is it because of the way depreciation is recorded?

Further question (sorry for all the questions): I’ve always used net income as the most important metric to value a company (obviously far from the only one) but it occurred to me that the kinda company i wanna invest in would be investing all their income back into growing and developing, would this reduce their net income to 0 or would it be counted as a depreciation expense over the next 10-15 years or whatever?

>We remain confident that market conditions are in place to benefit the domestic steel industry in 2021 and beyond,"" said Millett. ""While global economies are still recovering from the shock of COVID-19, we are seeing strong steel demand coupled with extremely low customer steel inventory throughout the supply chain. The automotive sector has experienced the strongest recovery, despite the electronic chip shortage, and the construction, equipment and transportation sectors are also strong. Our order entry continues to be robust across our businesses, and when coupled with historically low inventories, supports continued strong steel selling values.  
We believe this momentum will continue throughout the year and that ***our second quarter 2021 earnings will be even higher than our record first quarter 2021 results.***  
We also believe U.S. trade policies and existing steel trade cases will continue to moderate steel imports. Based on strong domestic steel fundamentals and customer optimism, we continue to be confident regarding North American steel market dynamics. This positive environment coupled with our strategic growth initiatives provide firm drivers for our further growth in the coming years.

The book has a good strategy that factors in Adjusted Slopes and ATR to rank stocks and then also advises on how you can re-balance your positions based on market condition.

For anyone working with just Excel, calculating Adjusted Slope and ATR for each stock is quite cumbersome. However, I was able to create a Python script to automate this entire thing for me. Every morning, this script sends me a list of S&P500 stock prices, their Adjusted Slope and ATR for the day. I will be backtesting the book's strategy and create automated rules based on that strategy. 

However, at this point, I'm curious to know how much do you use this strategy, adjusted slope or ATR for stock ranking? Is there any interest in getting the files I'm producing in the community?"

2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, April 19, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, April 19, 2021**

Stocks fell on Monday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) retreating from record levels with the benchmark Treasury yield climbing and market participants taking profits off the table after the recent record run. Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring earnings season, with many more notable companies reporting this week. 

Last week, the US reported great economic data that fuelled the current rally. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

After a very choppy first quarter to the year, volatility has subsided considerably in recent sessions. Despite a small spike today, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, remains near-14 month lows as equities continue higher. The VIX is known as the ""investor fear gauge,"" because it reflects investors' best predictions of near-term market volatility or risk. In general, the VIX rises during times of financial stress and falls during good economic times. It is a way to gauge the risk appetite of market participants. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “The S&P 500 has reached new highs while volatility has sharply declined. Low volatility has outweighed low correlations among stocks, driving return dispersion back below the long-term average. As the U.S. moves beyond key macro events such as the 2020 election, the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, and peak economic activity, we expect three defining themes for markets will be tax reform, infrastructure, and pricing power.

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered. 

**Highlights**

* Notable earnings for tomorrow: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), P&G (PG), Abbott (ABT),  Netflix (NFLX), Interactive Brokers (IBKR), Silvergate (SI)
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) slumped more than 6% before recovering throughout the day after reports that two people died after a driverless Tesla crashed in Texas
* The U.K. government said it would probe Nvidia Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp., over possible national security issues, adding new regulatory scrutiny to the proposed deal.
* China’s market regulator is investigating a joint venture between e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and Minmetals Development, amid a broad antitrust clampdown on internet firms in China.
* The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning Saturday advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March during a treadmill accident. This could affect the company's product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector, according to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.

While it seems oversold, everything I look at says it's still downward momentum and it's at a level right now where if it breaks below, it could drop to the $25 range so I'm considering cutting it now and taking the L. I wanted to find out a bit more about why the sector is tanking first though. 

The overall market seems fine, so is it related to the real estate market itself (I thought real estate was doing well) or other things like bonds or inflation? I would ask if it's $EXPI itself but the others in that sector seem to be going down as well. Any info is appreciated, thanks!

So I'm not sure I can explain this they way I want which is kind of why I'm asking the question here. I want to understand how the relationship works between market cap increases and value of the share price. And more specifically how over priced companies can grow into their lofty valuations. 

So let's take snowflake as an example. But there are many others with just as lofty valuations that we could use as an example. 

Now for the easiest way to ask this question:
If every 10% in share price $SNOW rises, the market cap rises by 3 billion. So what actually has to happen for them to be an actually fairly valued company. Is it earnings have to grow? Without the stock price rises along side earnings.

Everyone has their own style, whether it be focusing on growth stocks, going for dividends, focusing on a sector, or whatever. Your investing style may not be optimal but it is what **you are comfortable with.**

The reason I am saying this is because I read soooo many people ask if this is the top, or that we are at all-time highs or they want to sell because they are worried or they are down 10%. **If you are asking these questions, then maybe you are not investing according to your own investing strategy.** Maybe you are invested too heavily in stocks which is why you are worried about a 10% correction or maybe you are invested in too many small-cap stocks. You could also be worried because you need money in one year and you thought the stock market was an easy place to make money.

Whatever your reason for doubting your decisions, there has to be a reason why you are doubting your investment decisions and that's because it does to conform to your investing strategy anymore. **Each time you ask yourself these questions or get worried, reflect on what your investment strategy is.**

The snowflake investor.  It’s bad for the markets because these investors are trigger happy and will sell anything and everything at the first sign of a drop then buy back too late when it’s shooting back up.

HBO used to create 'must watch TV' because they were willing to take risks on gutsy shows that tapped into the zeitgeist in a deep way. Sometimes it worked with a broad audience (The Sopranos, Six Feet Under) but often it didn't (Enlightened, Treme). Now with the streaming wars, everyone is risk-averse and hyper-competitive, which leads to either pillaging old IP or trying to create hashtag-friendly fluff for the lowest common denominator. at some point HBO stopped playing its own game and is now playing Netflix's game. and it's not going to end well for them."

I think there’s more to it than the corporate decision to compete with Netflix though. There was a bidding war for proven talent once HBO streaming plans became clear. The show runners and producers were aggressively poached by others - D&D (GoT) and the Nolans (Westworld) among others.

What AT&T wanted was greater volume of shows which I don’t blame them for. HBO’s meticulous approach would not produce enough content for a streaming service - kinda what happened with Disney+ who had to compensate for low volume of shows with a very low price.

HBO Max has committed a blunder by releasing these movies simultaneously this year though. They lost favor with a lot of talent that way."

2021-04-19 23:33:20,stocks,Not sure what your father is invested in but most of the dividend payers I’d put money in don’t determine their dividend based on share price.

You have to figure it out for yourself but I get nuggets of information. He made over $200k for me off 12% investment over time.

It was more the using of dividends and capital gains from bad outlook funds in the future and using that power to buy in new funds that had the right future as he sees it."

2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Today is the first time in my life I opened a Fidelity Stock trading account. Posting here for luck. :) Some basic things to share -

1. I am familiar with the stock market basic things ( Stock buy low sell high)
2. Familiar with setting alerts so that I buy stock when price falls to certain price.
3. Looking   for long term investment (> 3Y). I fill up my 401k every year..and   75% of that is in Vanguard 500. So I am invested passively anyway.
4. The   rest of my savings, I would rather make it generate some income for me   than lie in a bank. I thought of saving for a house but I think that  is  too far ahead in the future now.
5. I am looking to invest in VOO, VOOV, VOOG, VTI as the stable ones. Was recommended PAVE, ARKK and SOXX. Any suggestions?
6. I do not want to time the market. I know the market is insanely high now. I will invest fixed amount (300$/ mo) for now.

Two questions -

1. What   is someone shares me a python script that I can use to download the   complete information of all these ETFs, and then I create my own   personal portfolio by buying individual stocks?? Will that be good??   Again - I will not be actively tracking as I am in for long.
2. Can I buy fractional stocks?? Is there a penalty for that?"

Generally the value of etf is its ease of access and need for limited to zero knowledge of the stock market. They restructure about every quarter so that one holding usually isnt more that 10% (for example). 

General consensus, there will be a market correction because the belief is that alot of tech stocks are over valued, but this is always a but more opinionated/subjective. Some of the data/proof is there, but valuations can also be on future earnings.

|Particular|2019|2020|Growth|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|484.4|621.1|28.22|
|Net income|58.2|30.6|(47.4)|
|Cash flow from ops|102.3|150.0|46.2|

This seems like a great business. Really high gross margins and decent profit margins. Profit was lower due to higher R&D and Marketing spend but they still managed to generate 150 Million dollars in cash.

There Commerce segment has grown to be a good chunk of their business too.

This figures does not include Tock which was acquired for 400 Million cash and stock and generated around 22 M in revenue is 2020,

The company has around 139 Million in cash, 37 in investments. The company also did something strange

>On December 7, 2020, the Company declared a one-time dividend of $2.666 per share, for a total of $328,112, for all stockholders of record as of December 14, 2020. Dividends of $327,745 were paid on December 29.

It also issued shares for something around the 68.3 per share range.

>On March 15, 2021, we amended our Certificate of Incorporation and created the Class C common stock with authorized shares of 7,673,154 and a par value of $0.0001. The Class C common stock has similar rights as our Class A and Class B common stock, except with respect to conversion and voting rights. Subsequent to the amendment, we issued 4,452,023 of our Class C common stock for proceeds of $304.4 million, net of issuance costs.

This seems a bit strange to me as the company paid dividend and then issued shares. I think the price will be close to 10 Billion which will value the company at around 16x Sales or 66X FCF from ops."
2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Dilution resources After GME decided to dilute shares, people are still buying the stock. This is so confusing as dilution decreases the value of your ownership and should in theory be a turn off for all future investors. Despite this, people are still buying the stock, even though gamestop could issue more shares at any time.

This has me wondering. Why wouldn't companies just continually dilute their stock? There seem to be very little repercussions as dilution isn't really priced into a current offering. Many investors buy the stock on current valuation, but do not discount for the potential of future dilution. So let's say a company is worth $1000 and issues 100 shares at $10 a piece. Then, couldn't it just issue another 900 at $1 a piece? And wouldn't they then have made a profit of $9 off the original investors? Are there SEC rules or regulations that prevent this?

This has me wondering why anyone would ever buy stocks if their number can be infinitely inflated. Also, I wonder why non-dilutable shares are not the norm. Maybe there are reputable companies with a history of not diluting their stock (Is there a database where one could check for past stock dilution for every publicly listed company?). Even if that is the case, I don't get why I should take the company at their word and not get a contractual agreement for non-dilutable ownership of that company."

Generic silver for about $32 an oz. Another suggestion is to just stash cash at home in a safe place.

* Inverse ETFs but this is risky. I usually dont hold them more than a day.
* Buy puts but risky like inverse ETFs albeit longer terms
* Gold... Its 100% speculative but there are billions of fools who thinks its valuable so you would be exploiting their idiocy.

During, you’ll feel scared getting back into anything.  Good time to buy the tide that floats all boats.  DCA your way in.

After, nail those companies that were too expensive before but that you wanted a slice of.  AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA and other triple digit stocks come to mind.

Since you can’t time it - diversify so that when certain stocks begin to fall - you can go liquid.  The DJI now is 32,000+

A 10% market correction is obvious when you see a 2000 pt drop coming down the pipe."

You are correct that buy and hold works long term, but it works best when the market is not at an ATH and overextended. Those who bought in a year ago or five years ago are sitting with a lot of buffer room. If you buy in right now, there is no buffer room before the (eventual?) fall. There is a calculated risk to entering the market right now. Today a Blockrock executive said on TV there is ""no value"" in the market today since we are so overextended.

2021-04-20 13:19:32,stocks,"Media does not speak to the rational mind; they peddle their trade by making sensationalist headlines. Sort of like you, with your categorical and judgemental language, come to think of it.

Rational minds saw there was a massive deficit in subprime housing loans, and that it would affect the housing and financial markets, while for example tech companies would come through it relatively unscathed (albeit with reduced opportunities to take in capital, which would severely affect those that didn't have positive cash flow). That's why people like Warren Buffet decided to buy, instead of sell.

I was here for the 2001 and 2008 crashes, and before. The first Occupy Wall Street protest started on September 17th, 2011. I'm sure there were protests before, but nothing on the scale of the Occupy movement.

So, move along, ""grasshopper"", and find someone else to bully."

I've started monitoring it a few weeks ago and I'm surprised to see it's still taking a bit of a dive despite only good news coming out for the company - partnering with VRBO, being listed as the biggest ""buy now, pay later"" company on the market. It also seems to be listed as a ""buy"" by every site I see.

2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,"What's Happening in the Markets: The Week of April 19th, 2021 Hello Traders and Investors! An exciting week ahead of us, here is my weekly newsletter which I share every Monday to help prepare you for the week! Feel free to DM me and happy trades!

**Week of 4/19/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday4/16/21. Bitcoin is currently trading at 55724.20, down from $60,309.40 last Monday 4/12/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversialtracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls “App Tracking Transparency,” for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, “biggest competitor.” Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, “Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we’re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.”

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the “double-Irish,” loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it’s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world’s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe’s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

A relatively low amount of  major economic numbers will be released this week. Reporting starts with Jobless Claims at 8:30AM on Thursday, April 22nd. Instead expect a busy week for earnings reports, with many major companies reporting earnings throughout the week.

Some of the larger players releasing earnings include Coca-Cola, on Monday, Johnson and Johnson on Tuesday, Intel on Thursday, and American Express on Friday. Also reporting earnings this week are several of the major travel companies impacted by last year's COVID shutdowns. This includes United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Royal Caribbean.

2021-04-20 00:00:00,stocks,"Signed up for Motely Fool Stock Advisor, seems like a huge scam/bait and switch? Hey guys. So I signed up for stock advisor since Amex has an offer where you get the yearly fee back as an account credit. Immediately on logging in, the very first thing it shows me is a page trying to upsell me to a service called Rule Breakers that costs 4 times as much. Seems like a massive red flag and dirty tactic since all the marketing before signing up focused on Stock Advisor. As to the stock picks themselves, it shows a very small handful of picks some of which seem pretty strange. New York Times, Pinterest, and Lemonade for example.

Any thoughts/ Experience?"

I don't know about you, but I can't make good stock decisions, so I have to let someone better at it, do it for me.

Also, keep in mind that it's meant to be a 3 to 5 year hold. If you need a quick flip in 6 months or a year, it's not the product for you.

Pro-tip, I have subscriptions to both Stock Advisor and Rule Breaker. I paid $100 each for two years of service. Google ""latimes stock advisor"" or rule breakers. Don't pay their overpriced cost. No cost to use the discount!"

2021-04-19 23:07:44,stocks,"You just have to know when you want to stop and filter the upselling out. You can build a whole portfolio off of their stock advisor and it will perform decently. I subscribe to both the SA and RB service and have been very happy with the results. I just think of the cost as part of an advisors fee that I am not paying by buying my own stocks and managing my own portfolio.

Like, if you had 100k+ that you were putting into stocks, a 1%-ish ($1000) fee is what you would expect from an active manager, if not more.

It gets a lot of hate, but I doubt many people on here shit talking it are outperforming an all motley fool portfolio.

Also, people (like people in general) do a really bad job of understanding the nature of the media/news/reporting they consume. It confuses a LOT of people - even on this thread - that the articles written by freelancers on their (the motley fool's) platform are unrelated to the services and therefore different outlooks can come across. It's like people reading the Wall Street journal opinion section and getting pissed off that it's super conservative, without realizing its a different entity than the WSJ"
2021-04-19 23:08:06,stocks,"I did the free year through Amex deals with the intent to cancel before the year is up. I knew what they were and what they do before signing up, and I have not found it all that helpful thus far for me personally. YMMV."

2021-04-19 23:10:51,stocks,"So, take this for what it’s worth, but I purchased Stock Advisor more than 10 years ago for one year.

Most of their recommendations I bought have done phenomenally well: NFLX, ENSG(+CTRE&PNTG), AMRC (took a while), WM, I think ATVI.

A few have been meh: AAP, HI, OLN

And there have been probably a few losers I’ve gotten rid of/forgot about. I also remember them recommending MSFT and 2010 me was like “that’s dumb MSFT is old news”... jokes on me.

They always offered the other services for different strategies. Their website got way too advertise-y for a while but hasn’t been as bad recently.

So long story long: they were legit 10+ years ago and definitely produced alpha. Don’t know if the alpha is still there but definitely not a straight up scam. I also have the AMEX credit and am going to use it for a year and then probably cancel it.

ETA: All the people trashing MF: yes, some of their shit is annoying, but they let their analysts write whatever tf they want and I’m sure some of it is just “I have to publish another article so I get paid”. And some of those analysts will disagree with each other.

But those people complaining about that shit probably haven’t had the subscription service. That is more vetted and there’s a reason they charge for it. Or at least there was 10+ years ago. I probably wouldn’t pay for it, but there’s no reason not to take the free year."
2021-04-19 23:12:05,stocks,Their picks are good and their marketing is horrible.  Plain and simple.  I have SA and Rule Breakers (free for both) and you're not missing anything.  SA has better performance over the years anyways.

Pros:
I use them for swing tr. picks, I only play long, so not always there is a good pick.
Generally it payed the subscription and gave some good benefits, BUT, do your own DD and check before buying, and never buy the top recommendation of the week.

i.e. $COUP at first it went down 20% so I DCAed, next month I was up 35%
Similar case with $TSCO and many others.
They targeted good picks at wrong time.

Cons:
Their articles are trash, I stopped reading, just read the weekly stock recommendations and analyse it yourself.

TL;DR They don’t give you anything exclusive, you can find good stocks without paying.
In my case, I still use them because they give me benefits, and benefit is why we are here."

Anecdotally, I've made some money off both of them, though what I now realize was mostly luck.  Back during the FANG craze like 10 years ago, I left my job and rolled over my 401k, pretty much exclusively into those stocks.  I completely depleted my savings moving several states over back to the west coast and it took me like 8 months to find a decent job.

TLDR; that ""decent job"" totally fucking lied about their bonus program etc and I had to liquidate my IRA (yup, penalties) to remain solvent until I could move, again, and take another several months to find my current job that I've had for a few years.  Thank god I netted a few hundred percent in returns in just a few years from FANG.....it kept me from being homeless.  Literally.

As for Motley Fool, I decided to ""take advice"" around the same time from them when I was gambling on penny stocks.  I bet on maybe 7 or 8 different recommendations that I read about and believed in.  One i broke even on (ZNGA...should have held I bought it sub $2 lol) .  The rest went to zero, sans one.

That one company (mobile software for logistics companies; can't remember the name) I put like $500 into when it was trading for $1 It doubled to like $2 within a year so I put in another $1500.  6 months later they got bought out at like $5.50 a share so I more than made up all the losses from the other bags I got caught holding and even made like $4000-5000.

All in all, I'd have to agree with you.  The professional pushers are just throwing darts at a dart board, but I've been lucky enough to latch onto a couple trends at the right time that made some $$$.  But I don't think I'm an expert any more than they are.  Just had some dumb luck.  Definitely not my strategy these days."

2021-04-19 21:31:23,stocks,"You can only cancel by filling out a form in triplicate and delivering it to the corporate office. You can find the form you need to fill out conveniently located in the basement of a mountaintop facility in Peru. The building is open 3:45AM to 4:30AM on the 5th Tuesday of every month (not open on months with only 4 Tuesdays), and you can find the form you need in the lowest basement sub-level, as long as the building hasn't flooded, which it periodically does (we're working on solving that problem, please be patient). Then just fill out the 27-page form (make sure not to make any errors -- that could cause delays! and yes, spelling counts). After filling out the form, you'll need to hand-deliver it to the corporate office deep in the backcountry of Mongolia. The office has no access by road, no electricity, and no phone connection, which is why you'll need to hand deliver the form, and it's only open on the summer solstice at *exactly* noon, Eastern Time. Cancellation forms will not be accepted more than 30 seconds late or early. Once the form is submitted, expect your cancellation to be processed in 8 to 10 months, during which you will still be billed. If you miss any payments during that period, it will mean that your account is no longer in good standing and therefore cannot be cancelled -- you'll need to get back up to date on your payments and then start the process over again."

It's common wisdom that index funds are difficult to beat, especially for the lack of effort required. Applying that same principle to smaller cap stuff, where there may not be any index funds tracking, can give the diffusion of risk and weighting of index funds, but with a little more speculation involved. Still wouldn't put a major % of assets into it, but it also wouldn't need much to blow way up in the long run if it's largely left untouched other than some trimming on excessive rallies, or adding a bit during major corrections / crashes.

The people that fail are the ones that don’t average in and don’t use the diversity portfolio recommendations. They plunk all their cash into momentum and growth stocks and ignore the ETF, REIT and bond recommendations.

Is a user supposed to compare the percentage return of a stock that has traded for a 3 months vs. a stock that has traded for 30 years? 

How is that useful when I'm trying to make decisions?

""Let me pull up this list. Let's see, Lemonade lost 20% this month but it's up 5% from when these guys bought it so that's good. Oh, wait! These guys got a return of 23,465% on Netflix since 2005. Decision made, I'll hop in my time machine and get rich!""

When I sort by losses on the Stock Advisor stock list, they have a remarkably small number of losses - because this list isn't composed of all their stocks.

2021-04-20 09:32:22,stocks,"Because I just jumped in. Long term hold or not you have to revaluate your decisions. If something like TAN is not only underperforming every other stock I bought, but going straight down, maybe it's time to revaluate that?  I don't have to hold to some ""rule"". I kept the money in, just put it in something with more upside after I became more educated. Something wrong with that?"
2021-04-20 09:36:05,stocks,Just testing your mindset and seeing how you’d respond. Generally agree with you but short term prices are random. Stuff can go straight up or down for no reason and you just have to sift through the publicly available info to see if your thesis was wrong. Generally it’s difficult to figure out unless there’s really publicly bad news that makes you rethink because strategies and outcomes don’t have to track together.

Down 9% because of a report that the treadmills can be dangerous for kids and pets after one kid got trapped under one and died.  In my non-professional experience, overreactions to news headlines like this often provide fantastic buying opportunities.

The death is tragic for sure, but the fact that a kid died doesn't mean the company is suddenly worth 9% less than it was yesterday."

You are paying a premium for the brand.  The company isn't profitable yet and the demand will go down.  The barrier to entry isn't very high for competitors.  

I would put them at price target of closer to the $50-60 range.  I think we will see a gig economy app that lets fitness instructors host their own workouts, spin classes, zumba etc that you can sign up for and pay the instructor would be a better model than this closed ecosystem."

2021-04-20 09:54:22,stocks,"This is wrong on many levels.

1) Brand value is huge.  Just ask Apple, Tesla, Lululemon, etc.  Peloton has a cult following that is very difficult for competitors to match.  I know many people who are Peloton customers and every one of them loves it.  I don't know a single person who is a customer of Nordictrack or whatever.

2) What isn't good about the business model?  The bikes and treadmills were just the start.  The real growth will come from digital subscriptions and expansion into other areas of fitness.  That in turn will allow them to bring down the prices of their equipment, which will open them up to more customers.

3) Your price target is based on what?  This company had $1.8B in sales in 2020 and are projecting over $4B in sales for 2021.  At an enterprise value of about $30B, that puts them at a trailing EV/Sales of 16 and forward EV/Sales of about 7.5.  Those aren't crazy numbers at all for a high growth company.

4) No, you will not see instructors turning to a gig economy as an alternative.  Popular Peloton instructors are like celebrities in that world; some of them have hundreds of thousands of social media followers.  And I'm sure they're paid quite well by Peloton.  And guess what?  The popularity of the instructors attracts customers, which grows the audience and attracts more instructors, which attracts more customers, and so on.  Why would an instructor pass this up to try it on their own?"

That is very, very difficult to copy."

2021-04-19 23:47:36,stocks,"If you think the stock's long term prospects have changed or risk has become unacceptably high. In order to avoid just selling low because I'm scared and missing out on a rebound, I will gradually sell in that situation over a period of time. 

The other situation where I'll sell is just if the stock is pissing me off seeing it in my portfolio. Those situations usually aren't relatively high losses. Obviously, that situation isn't really driven by strategy, I just try to make sure it isn't unstrategic. 

All that said, I got frustrated holding individual stocks and now prefer ETFs, where I never have to make that determination.

ETA: I don't have a fixed percentage loss for a stock where I'll sell. If my reason for buying the stock hasn't changed, I prefer the ""buy and hold"" strategy where I'm betting on there being a rebound at some point."

2021-04-19 21:46:18,stocks,"Nope. I knew I had time to recover before retirement, so I shovelled as much as I could into the market through the big dip, but started pulling cash out in '13, and was completely out of the market by the end of '13. Since a major correction didn't come within a few months, I've been trying to play catch up since then. 

Extra off-topic info:
I played the dips at the end of '17 and '18 pretty well. I also sold off a lot in Jan and Feb '20, and re-bought all the way down, but I didn't believe that the bounce was real and started selling covered SPY calls around 310, and I'm still trying to roll out of those, so my history is repeating itself. I'm trying to shift into up a boring, diversified portfolio of domestic and international index funds (including shifting from SPY to RSP) , inflation protected bond funds, a REIT fund, and a little COST and HMC, and retire (barista-fire) this year."

For example, after the 2008 crash you could get Wells Fargo for $2 a share.  The biggest mistake I saw coworkers make is selling after the market crashed and missing out on the quick rebound.  That is how you destroy wealth."

2021-04-20 05:04:04,stocks,"I'm not from the US (but from Estonia) and I am certainly not an experienced ""stock market person"", but I was investing before the crash (tiny amounts). But I can confidently say, that although in hindsight the entire crash was so obvious and inevitable, it came as a massive surprise and shock. The entire country was in euphoria all the way into the crisis. Main party won the elections just before the elections with a ludicrous ""we'll take Estonia to the 5 richest countries in Europe in 15 years"" election promise and the main opposition party had promised to increase wages by 300% in 4 years. Real estate was in an insane boom as well as the stock market.

Obviously it had to collapse, and it did, by GDP falling by 25% in 2 years. But it was very much a shock. Even as the crises was unfolding people were still projecting ""a slower growth"", ""a tiny and temporary correction"" etc. Our prime minister stated ""if this is a crisis, it is a crises I want to live in"". Even the most pessimistic people weren't expecting the economy to go to the toilet so fast and so far.

Now the economy here is so small and insignificant that comparing it to the US economy and stock market is pointless. You literally can't short stocks here, no options nothing. Only buy stocks. So yeah, you couldn't profit from the fall even if you knew it was coming. (Well I'm sure you could, like stay in cash and buy all the companies after they dropped in price by 80%). But I think the general idea is the same. In hindsight it was obvious. In that time and place however, most people were absolutely clueless about what was about to happen."
2021-04-20 10:07:51,stocks,"I went to cash in late 2007.  I kept reading about the sloppy, some say criminal, mortgages being given to anybody who could stand up.  Then coming home from work I heard an ad on the radio from Lending Tree.

""Buying your 1st home?  We'll lend you 110% of the purchase price.""  I went home and told my partner, we're getting out of the market.  I went to 75% cash, what I didn't sell was my taxable stock account because, taxes.  In retrospect I should have sold and paid the taxes.

I wasn't predicting the crash.  I just felt that the financial markets were being incredibly stupid and that keeping my gains was a far better idea than participating in the bubble.  

As it turned out, I was too early but I was in a great position to pick up SBUX for less than 10 bucks, F for a few bucks and having cash in 2009 enabled me to retire in 2012.

2021-04-19 23:55:41,stocks,"Everyone could see something is wrong, bubble is there, crazy is there, but did anyone see the crash itself coming and how things collapsed ?

Like everyone can see and worry stock market going crazy, people been worried for 12 years and could be worried for 12 more as it tops ATH after ATH once again. Since 2020 people been extra worried.

If it crashes down everyone will go like ''i don't get how people didn't see it coming, it was clearly obvious'', but at the same time betting against the market for 10 - 20 years will lead people to solvency issues and take away the gains they could got instead.

Hindsight is great, but for how many years before 2008 people talking about shit being crazy, people still could endlessly question like today, is all of this shit really going to crash down ? Everyone in my country went like ''oh economists warned us about this since forever'', but how much they were worth listening to ? Is it a real case or did they ended up predicting 20 of the the last 1 crashes that actually happened ?

I find it interesting to think about."

But those who re-balanced away from pricey US stocks and first world real estate did well on the total trip, for example those who were overweight commodity companies, gold/silver and emerging markets. Even those who stood mostly in cash during 2006-2008 and bought aggressively in 2009 did pretty well, while many of those who made a lot of money in 2006-2008 lost most of it in the crash."

But they were right that it was a dangerous bubble and indeed it crashed in relatively short term.

Most people who dismissed them lost what they made by investing near the top, and many of them even suffered losses on the principal."

2021-04-19 22:50:34,stocks,"Tanked fast, then recovered in a few months? Are you misremembering? You know the historical charts exist and everyone can look it up right? 

SPX took over a year to go from peak to trough and took several years before it reached that peak again. It was absolutely nothing like last year. If 2008 happened again now you’d get suicide posts and emotional support threads every day for months on end as the blood red days go on for months and months and months with no sign of rebound in sight."

2021-04-20 02:42:29,stocks,As user below stated some countries in EU has negative interest and i think one of the scandinavian countries also pays you for the loan... but negative also meaning below inflation. Ie pretty common mortgages of 1 percent are below inflation so bank is loosing money essentially. But you cannot fix rates for long. I think max is 7 years but not sure. And 3 years fix are pretty common (most people falsely think interests rates will only go down as they did in the last decade)
2021-04-20 03:14:57,stocks,"The bank adds its margin to the interest rate which means you still get charged an interest, but it is very low. 

Also, in some countries the negative interest rate actually translates to you having to pay if you deposit your money in a bank. These cases are rare, though."
2021-04-20 00:47:00,stocks,"Many people saw both the crash of 2000 and 2008 coming and managed to avoid them by re-balancing internationally, into alternative assets and even staying mostly in cash. Both bubbles were quite obvious and widely discussed, the problem was that nobody could say precisely when they would pop. There were Wall-Street sell-side analysts (the usual suspects) who were cheering the bubbles on for personal profit thus fooling some people, but they they were lying on purpose just as they do nowadays. Jeremy Grantham and others have commented repeatedly on the perverse incentives of sell-side analysis in this regard.

It's not that people don't know that it's a bubble, it is that they choose to believe otherwise and filter out information accordingly. Historically, Wall-Street has always pushed misinformation to inflate bubbles since it has a clear profit motive to do so."
2021-04-19 21:44:10,stocks,"Sentiment-wise, it is way more similar to 2000.

I don't think we'll see an 80% drop like back then unless long term interest rates shoot to 6%. But I'm pretty sure there will be pain in the companies that are nowhere near profitability -- especially the ones with no revenue.

As far as I understand it, the ethical issue wasn't necessarily that they knew they were creating a system that was bound to fail. The ethical issue was that they shouldn't have been making mortgage loans to people who had no realistic ability to pay them back.

Unfortunately, not only did those shoddy loans harm the borrowers, in this particular case they actually brought down the entire world economy."

I don’t have any good new ideas. So I’m trading my positions and eventually moving closer to cash. I don’t give a shit about lost opportunity. You might.

He is also concerned that some fancier funds only mimic buying and selling the securities in their portfolio though options, which could lead to a liquidity crisis if they have to suddenly unwind positions in thinly traded stocks (say if they get massive outflows). There is also massive outside options activity on indexes and ETFs (placed by various traders unconnected to those funds) which further complicates matters. For example statistical arbitrage by various hedge funds between certain securities and their sector ETFs or various ETFs etc. Add index futures and options on such to this mix for good measure."
2021-04-20 03:07:54,stocks,"This is true, but nobody knew just how vulnerable the system was to a decline in the housing market.  Except those who really looked into it, like Burry. 

I think one cannot really fathom just how complex the system had gotten, and nobody was really paying attention to all aspects of it.  The housing bubble bursting was one thing, but how major investment banks like Lehman could fall and the economy could go into cardiac arrest was not something that most people ever considered possible.

I think we had forgotten a lot of the lessons learned from the Great Depression, and in fact this had led to a lot of deregulation which ultimately served to facilitate the collapse."

2021-04-20 18:42:58,stocks,"Yeah sure but that’s a one week sample size. Everyone is convinced the market is overvalued and then it rips upward for a few more years. Imagine being 30% cash in May 2020 waiting for the “dead cat bounce” to end. Or you shifted to cash in 2018 during the mini correction. Or in 2016 due to uncertainty surrounding the election. You lose that battle in most cases with such a high cash allocation

Fine by me if you don’t want to buy anything but many small growth names with strong leadership like DKNG, FTCH, AMD, NET, etc. are all fairly or undervalued. I know you’re gunna say “but meh PEs” so I’ll throw in some more established names as well

You could argue AMZN is super undervalued based on its growth trajectory and lack of price movement as of late. Same with BABA though there’s obviously China risk there. JPM looks pretty reasonable considering they just blew out earnings expectations. Visa considering consumer spending is going to increase a whole lot as we recover from Covid. Defensive stocks like Boeing are still pretty damn cheap. AT&T is looking crazy low with catalysts like 5G and HBO Max gaining subscriptions. Disney is a bit more expensive but looks good as parks open and Disney+ continues to crush expectations. Legacy automakers could be a way to go as they shift spending to be competitive with Tesla in the EV/autonomous market. No offense but if you can’t find a single undervalued stock in this market then you must not be looking hard enough"

I think that even The Economist had articles about it. Burry wasn't the only one to notice, but he is one of the few who took the risk to go short.

But it's fair to say that nobody expected the magnitude of the crisis, in particular the sovereign defaults in the EU. A lot of people argued that we had successfully internationalized and dispersed risk through CD swaps, but there were quite a few who understood that ""marked to model"" could fail badly if the market had a liquidity shock. However most of Wall Street kept dismissing the risks anyway, at least in public.

You are right that deregulation was a huge part of it."

2021-04-20 11:36:34,stocks,"Yeah. And that's a good way to put it: ""serious money."" Your serious money should be off limits from the ebb and flow swings to one's emotions. Play the market on the side (it's a casino, and any serious trader knows it). So serious money needs to have a DCA approach. If people are swing trading or momentum trading with their ""wealth management account"" i.e. serious money, then they are no different than someone dropping their life savings on a roulette table. It's best to seperate the two. Have an ""equities account"" that you play with. Have a DCA account where you build wealth. One is to speculate and play with money. The other is to build wealth. Too many people think ""making money"" and ""building wealth"" are the same thing. They aren't."
2021-04-20 03:46:30,stocks,"This is true, there were many people who warned.  But they were most definitely a minority.  And again, I don't think the majority of those who warned appreciated just how deeply the system would collapse.  It was truly unprecedented, at least since '29, which had long since been forgotten.

But there were most definitely warning signs for those who were paying attention, yes.  We got lazy and reckless."
2021-04-20 06:43:58,stocks,"You are welcome ;)  On BLDP, like that there is over 25% insider ownership; thus their interests are aligned with shareholders coupled with China JV and EU partnership focusing on buses and heavy vehicles makes it attractive to me.

2021-04-20 04:35:01,stocks,"I expected the crash and re-balanced though I was early on that by about a year. I was very suspicious of Wall-Street hype but didn't expect that it would end up so badly, in particular I was taken by surprise by the sovereign debt crisis and quite shocked by what happened at major investment banks such as Goldman and Deutsche.

I was following the interbank market at the time, which is why I got more and more scared in 2006 and 2007."

Good on you for rebalancing.  Yeah, from what I understand people were saying the crisis was contained etc. just before shit hit the fan.  And yes, as we have agreed upon it seemed that nobody knew just how bad things could possibly get."
2021-04-20 03:03:23,stocks,A very fair point.
2021-04-20 05:00:36,stocks,"Yes, I am an EU citizen (but studied and worked/lived in the US for many years). A lot of people claimed that things were under control even after the Merrill Lynch debacle, in many ways the fancy arguments we hear now remind me of that. I was invested internationally after rebalancing in early 2007 so the sovereign crisis in the EU impacted some of my positions, luckily I was underweight developed markets so I wasn't crushed as others were.

After that experience I became a lot more interested in global macro and geopolitics, so nowadays I spend some time trying to guess where the world is headed (which seems to be quite a lot darker than what we had for the past 30 years, because of the increasingly serious conflict between the West and China+Russia)."
2021-04-20 05:07:02,stocks,"Yeah, you could have fooled me, your English is impeccable (I don't mean to patronize at all!). 

I really appreciate your first hand perspective.  I have my degree in economics which I completed in 2013, and I've been reading up furiously on the issue these last couple of months.  Cool to hear from someone who lived through it as an adult. Sounds like you made it out OK. 

If I can probe you some more, could you elaborate more on what you think about the current state of affairs?  The mania and rampant speculation in the stock market, but also in housing and you-know-what that we can't talk about here has me concerned.  The Federal Reserve is trying to stimulate the economy, and I have no doubt that some of that money makes it into efficient outcomes (new business projects, new hires, more productivity, etc.). But it seems like a lot of it is making it into ventures that provide no return other than speculation.  I don't see this as sustainable, but then again, I'm not an expert.

Any thoughts on it that you'd like to share?"
2021-04-20 05:32:09,stocks,"Yeah, I was one of the lucky ones in 2008 -- more a function of having the right information at the right time than anything else. I have friends and former colleagues who are in investment banking at bulge bracket firms and that certainly helped (though even they were taken by surprise by the magnitude of the crisis and by the unethical behavior of some people/groups even at highly reputable banks).

I am bearish on the US stock market in the medium term though I think that the party might continue for a while (not too long though).

I agree that signs of bubble behavior are very obvious in cryptocurrencies, spacs (that's popping now), meme stocks (also started to pop) and that poor risk management is obvious in popular funds (see ARK Invest which takes on layers of risk e.g. by buying Tesla which bought bitcoin etc.), so I expect a chain reaction in some funds when crypto crashes.

I also agree with Burry and others that the ETF and index fund craze of the last few years have inured many people to market and macro risks and that there is an increasing chance of a cascading liquidity crisis in various places. It's not quite as bad as what we had in 2008 at least in the banking sector (because of better regulation) but I am skeptical of the risk management of certain over-leveraged hedge funds.

I also see major geopolitical risk in the Chinese stock market and related Western companies because of the increasingly serious tension over Taiwan, Xinjiang etc. and the fast rapprochement between China and Russia; the international market seems to be fragmenting along geopolitical lines, which will continue to remodel supply chains.

I think that the Fed will do whatever it can, but it can't control the appetite for risk of investment banks and especially of hedge funds. Only the government can do that through regulation, but regulation tends to come only after things go wrong.

In any case I do expect a crash within the next few years. I largely agree with Jeremy Grantham's assessment of where the US market is at, which is why I have been slowly rebalancing towards international value though largely avoiding China, Russia and countries whose economies are highly correlated to them:

2021-04-20 18:02:43,stocks,"Once again much appreciate you providing this info.  As I said I studied economics and what I don't get is how more people aren't sounding the alarm on this?  I feel like there is something I must be missing.  I'd like to see what the bull case is, but from a respectable and reputable source.

It seems Grantham has a bone to pick with the Federal Reserve, and that could be an ideological thing, and there may be other ways of interpreting the same scenario we have right now.  In fact, I'm sure this is the case.

That said, I do worry about the rampant speculation right now, as I said, and Grantham makes a lot of sense.  But I just can't imagine that it's that easy and that obvious.  There must be more to this.  I am going to keep digging.  Thanks for giving me some food for thought.

2021-04-19 23:31:03,stocks,What is this in layman terms?
2021-04-20 00:27:41,stocks,"ARM the company is responsible for the ARM ISA, which is the instruction set architecture for ARM CPUs.  The ISA is akin to the language the CPU will interpret.  ARM also produces reference designs for CPU cores that interpret this language.  Most of the ARM CPUs from various companies that make ARM CPUs use these reference cores.  Apple is different in that it designs its own cores to interpret the instruction set.  This is one of the reasons Apple CPUs are so much faster than other ARM chips.  Apple is also different in that it was one of the founders of ARM Holdings, and reputedly it works very closely with ARM on new versions of the ISA.

RISC-V is an alternative ISA to ARM.  It is an attempt for industry to come together and create an open standard that is not controlled by any one company.

Put yourself in Apple's place.  Suppose you want to open up a new source of revenue by selling your Mx ARM chips in the server market.  The M1 is fast and low power.  It might make a great CPU for a dense server farm.  Even as you contemplate selling CPUs to the server market you see that Nvidia will be a competitor.  Every chip you sell helps Nvidia because you have to pay ARM, which is now owned by Nvidia.  You will be motivated to give more support to RISC-V, looking to eventually cut out ARM altogether.  In the place of Apple, you could place AMD, Qualcomm, Samsung, etc.  Those other companies are more vulnerable than Apple because they use ARM's core designs."

My sentiment based on the financials and balance sheet is while they due carry a large amount of debt at 64b it’s forgetting their large backlog of deliveries and these sales deals are in the billions each. I see they’re ramping up hiring and management is tackling each issue head on one at a time mostly stating quiet while they deal with them.  While the analyst scream out and generate fear I think on a 5 year time horizon we could easily see above 300 again. The fad right now Is to claim air travel will never recover to pre pandemic levels due to zoom and go to meeting for business. My thesis is that history always repeats itself and humans are relationship driven beasts by nature. You cannot capture this over a digital meeting the same way that you can in person. Businesses are competitive and I’m sure businesses would happily eat the cost of flying someone out to manage business relationships rather than risking it souring over a remote zoom meeting. I think the assumption of a fully digital economy as far as relationships is over exaggerated. We are already seeing a cultural revolt of younger generations against Facebook, and other social media for poisoning the cup. 

Covid vaccinations are much more rapid than the media is letting on. Nationwide nearing 30% full vaccination and 40% with first shot of Pfizer. I think by mid June to early July realistically we have that 80% magic number for herd immunity.

There's no special prize for being in the green in every position, and there's nothing that's going to change the fact that you already (hypothetically) spent $20 on a stock that's now $10. If it's a good buy then buy more, if there are better opportunities then sell it and take the loss. 

That said I only really understood how stupid and psychological this way of thinking was after I did it myself a year ago. I bought some TTM before covid kicked off at like $13/share, averaged down when it was like $6, waited for the price to go up a bit and exited the position at a gain overall. But I missed way better buying opportunities in a historic recovery while I was farting around with TTM (and did the same thing with GE)."

2021-04-19 20:30:13,stocks,"You're right about the fact your cost basis would be $12, meaning anything above $12 is a profit. But your loss doesn't become $2, it becomes $2 x number of shares you own, therefore $10, so you're right back where you started if you bought and sold immediately. 

But should your stock rise over $12 your profit would be in 5 x (share price minus $12)"
2021-04-19 20:29:31,stocks,"If you average down to $12/share by buying four more shares and the market price is still $10/share, you just distribute the $10 loss of your original share bought at $20 across all 5 shares that you own.

2021-04-19 23:36:22,stocks,"QQQ tracks the Nasdaq-100, which is not all 2500+ companies or whatever that are in .IXIC.

I'd be more willing to listen to the double top lower high=DOOOOM idea in .IXIC or something but (a) there is an unfinished auction in the Nasdaq-100 again I believe and (b) there is enough information to know that the Nasdaq-100 can drive the Nasdaq by itself (that's basically what has been happening since the bottom on March 8th).

The bearish case right now though, and one that I do see as an issue though, is that the continued trashing of the higher valued tech stocks could cancel this out. If that ends up overriding NDX, that unfinished auction will be put on wait mode again (unless we see a sell in May and go away, I think it'll be seen then though)."

2021-04-19 20:52:00,stocks,"I think you're making the right call by not engaging in options right now as they can be very very risky if you don't really know what you're doing. Try with paper trading first if you're curious before trading real money. I say this as someone who has only done a couple options trades myself cuz I'm concerned about the risk involved and am a newbie myself with options.

As for minimizing loss, there is nothing you can do at this moment to ""get back"" the $10 loss in value from your share. Now, if you bought the share after research and believe in the company and anticipate shares to rise, you can ""average down"" so that your average cost of shares would be lower than if you only have the one share bought at a higher price. This way you make back losses faster. I'd only advise this though if you are long on the company and have good reason to believe it will gain. Throwing good money after bad is not a winning strategy in the long term"

2021-04-19 21:54:29,stocks,"Yeah at that price you must've been getting in after the Doordash IPO which was their last news that really moved the stock price much in a good way. 

Uber is definitely one of the holdings I'm less excited about long-term, but medium term I think the stock price will recover when people start using it more as covid ends, and it's already a little over what Softbank paid for their original stake (and they started selling it off this past winter). 

It's hard to evaluate the private equity investments until they go public which understandably worries people. But there are more positives than negatives on that end imo: Doordash and Coupangs IPOs give the vision fund huge gains on paper and the valuations are supported now by public markets, Wework's merger looks like it will get that gorilla off their backs, Grab merger is almost finalized and it's huge, Didi should have an IPO on the horizon and is very promising, eventually Bytedance too. 

Then for other assets the ARM sale is turning into a bit of a drag but even if it falls through it's a great asset in itself. The BABA stake should recover eventually."

AHCO - Medical device company. Very under the radar. Ridiculous growth and acquisitions. Was featured in IBD not long ago

- will benefit from Biden's green infrastructure plan + electrify America (government vehicles and school buses) 
- will benefit from any ""buy America"" criteria (recently won a contract for buses with Washington State, and they were +200k higher than the low bidder, but due to Buy America, Proterra was chosen
- Proterra board member on Biden's environment team
- Daimler is a big partner

I remind myself that it's a long road and if the thesis is the same for the stock; I hold and add a few shares here and there on the dips.

2020 is an abnormal year in which you can't fail even if you tried.  Almost every single stock had great returns.  The markets have always been a slow returner; average has been 7-10% for the last 100 years.  It's rare for the indexes to return 100% in a year and people forget that."

Couple this with people seeing this as either gambling or a hobby and you have a lot of people who are willing to lose money (I say willing, but I mean they are willing to YOLO money, for fun, for karma, hopefully to make money). I think the market is going to be in a volatile and euphoric phase for awhile (a decade plus).

2021-04-20 10:04:07,stocks,"ENW (EnWave Corporation) and WMD (WeedMD) are the two I've been following. ENW develops vacuum microwave drying technology for food, pharmaceuticals, cannabis, etc. Seems pretty solid for creating dried foods and they've been signing some good deals recently with for things like MREs. They're also looking to expand into the cannabis industry which I think could be their golden ticket to success. Not sure how much you know about cannabis but they're able to preserve somewhere around 10-16% more terpenes and cannabinoids in the drying process in a fraction of the time. Their tech can process kilograms within hours versus conventional week long air drying.

WMD is a smaller cannabis company that has primarily focused on the medicinal side of things. They have outdoor crops and then process that into concentrates for medical patients. They're moving into the recreational market now. Outdoor crops will have high profit margins alone, but when turning it into concentrates you have a further profit margin. Once they move into the recreational market I think their profit will increase quite a bit. Along with this they have a contract with a pretty large construction union (LiUNA) for medicinal cannabis."

2021-04-20 01:29:10,stocks,CNG or even LNG (even more compressed and therefore liquid natural gas) is a fossil fuel. It has a high energy density and is preferable to conventional fuel but hydrogen can be produced using renewable energy. Since renewable energy is not a steady energy source but has peaks in production (imagine a sunny day with a lot of wind) which might be higher than the current energy demand (imagine this sunny day being a sunday when there is not a lot of production) this excess energy can then be used to produce hydrogen whithout producing carbon dioxide (this is called green hydrogen). Therefore hydrogen is a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in transportation.

Reality, I didnt set a hard PT exit. My plan was to see how earnings Q1 went, see what it said about how the new CEO will manage the finances and give an indication what he plans to do with the money they are about to make. Also see what their pulp and paper sectors are looking like. 

At this point, i’m almost certainly holding into the summer. Once we get to Q2 Earnings, i am going to reassess the market conditions. If pulp and paper markets seem to be strong, the futures markets suggest lumber stays over 1k into 2022, i may hold longer. 

I think they will be debt free this year. If lumber stays over 1000 for the year. We are looking at $9-12 EPS for the year from lumber alone. If lumber staying 1000 going into 2022, hard to determine what PE the market will tolerate, but even a PE of 4 on 10 EPS means 40$ SP...

So TLDR: i dont know yet. But when i think there no longer is a story for continued growing earnings is when i will start drawing down."

So by end of the day i honestly doubt any of us have deeper understanding of it and we will just be using the catchphrase to justify whatever the fuck our point is. One will say keeping money in the market is opportunity cost and you get to have those 10% per year that adds up, another will say keeping it on sidelines is opportunity cost and you get to straight up 2x - 10x your entire net worth.

Argue the points and so on, but adding more catchphrases and Warren Buffet quotes is just not the way to go about, as i said its just being said to justify whatever the fuck they are doing. I used the same Warren Buffet to argue completely opposite points of how everyone uses him, i used opportunity cost to give opposite advice right in this comment."

2021-04-20 00:55:04,stocks,"Opportunity cost is what you're giving up so no matter what you do it's always there. In some cases it can be quantified or measured, others not. Its still an important part of any decision making you perform. It's not a gimmick or catchphrase though, it's an economic term that helps you frame your decision making process. 

The opportunity cost of writing this to you is 10 minutes of my time. Maybe I'd use it differently or more productively, maybe not. I choose to spend 30 minutes on reddit before bed instead of doing something productive because this is my downtime. Opportunity cost would be watching a video for example. Either way it's not a large opportunity cost. If I'm doing this at work and I risk getting fired/ not getting shit done then it has a higher opportunity cost. 

Bottom line, it's a way to measure against alternative choices and sometimes it can make things a lot more clear as to what to do with your time or money. As you said the opportunity cost of GME was earning yearly 10% in SP500. You either accept it or you don't. It can be used for other things like savings account versus bonds/stocks as well."

Furthermore, I don’t think inflation greater than 3% would be longterm, the fed is by far smarter than us, and while that may sound ignorant, if you really think you know how the fed will fail with inflation or something, then go ahead, but the fed employees  some of the smartest people in the country, and they will see any problem you think you are seeing that nobody else is.

As for who will win, ChargePoint already won the race... we're just waiting to see who comes in 2nd and 3rd. 

Overall it's now a waiting game for Congress so they can capitalizing on the Biden infrastructure plan to build the 500K charging stations. Given their existing market penetration it's unlikely anyone else will come close to catching up to them in this business save for Tesla."
2021-04-20 12:28:16,stocks,"Bingo! They are undervalued the way Tesla was prior to their breakout in 2020. I've been saying it for a while now they're the Standard Oil of the EV charging business. It's not a matter of who will win the EV charging game, the race is already over and they finished 1st a long time ago, now we're just waiting for who's going to be 2nd & 3rd."
2021-04-19 20:15:27,stocks,"Our power company just got a deal with CHPT and if that's happening here, it's happening in a lot of places. They will beat earnings. It's a gold plated company that's years ahead of its time."
2021-04-20 12:29:15,stocks,"Their stock did get a bump when that plan was announced, but they are one of the most shorted stocks by hedge funds and it's causing them to sell off all their gains from the past year.

Once the shorts stop grinding the price down artificially expect it to pop to $35-45. Ditto once WSB figures out this is a short squeeze just waiting to happen. By all rights this should be trading sideways $22-26 right now.

The good news... the last 2 times it touched this point it shot up almost 30% inside a week."
2021-04-19 20:40:47,stocks,Feels like 2008 in here.
2021-04-19 23:43:06,stocks,What were the percentage returns on those wins vs losses?
2021-04-20 06:47:14,stocks,Watch my video review
2021-04-20 12:53:58,stocks,"Going downtrend, hopefully can enter under 300"
2021-04-20 00:41:14,stocks,No idea but it's a massive buying opp. Can't wait to see where it is in 5 years...
2021-04-20 00:37:34,stocks,They have been buying back plenty. Have been all month.
2021-04-20 09:49:53,stocks,"I'm in the same boat, I have a bunch of PENN that keeps getting whittled away each day from a nice profit. I want to hold long term, but if the outlook isn't looking positive I'm going to get rid of it."
2021-04-19 21:13:15,stocks,"I appreciate your comments and what you said is entirely true except on point:  a lot has changed since February to now.

1.	⁠EMI issue bigger then we initially thought
2.	⁠Commercial operations delayed until 2022
3.	⁠Hint of shareholder dilution at earnings call
4.	⁠Spaceship 3 reveal
5.	⁠George Whitesides out and several other key employees
6.	⁠New leadership in engineering hired
7.	⁠Chamath sells entire personal holdings of the company
8.	⁠Richard Branson sells $150 million dollars of shares
9.	⁠Blue origin (a direct competitor) had a successful test flight
10.	⁠Ark launches space ETF and Virgin Galactic is less than 2% of fund

So I just listed out 10 things that have changed since February. 10, 10, 10 that is huge !  So people need to stop saying “nothing has changed “. Yeah a lot has actually , some are good but mostly are negative snd mean we are in a longer haul then we initially thought"
2021-04-20 14:06:56,stocks,sound advice.
2021-04-20 17:40:23,stocks,"I have a couple,  but it was only a couple of hundred dollars invested. Money that I would have wasted anyways. Way I look at it is I'd rather buy a few stocks than lottery tickets or going to the casino or to a movie and waste it,  because if you just halfass the DD your odds are way better at turning a profit so I indulge in a few meme stocks here and there."
2021-04-20 10:05:54,stocks,"sorry forgot to reply. Yes, and you could set it to a fixed price, or percentage ( i prefer percent)"
2021-04-20 17:25:45,stocks,"Predicting the exact timing of a crash is next to impossible and I’ve heard crash sentiment since June last year haha. But I feel like the general thought is that the Fed is propping up the market and cannot do so forever. Eventually they’ll have to remove the crutches and, when they do, the person with the broken leg (i.e. the market) will come tumbling to the ground. Whether a market crash will be the outcome of the Fed eventually raising interest rates again, I don’t know. No one does. But it’s a likely theory, I suppose. One thing I do know is that trying to time the market never goes well. So just invest now and leave some cash on the side to buy with if/when the crash does come, but don’t try to time it and predict when."
2021-04-19 23:08:10,stocks,"You have to understand most bond investors aren't trying to collect a coupon rate, they are searching for yield for their clients. Those clients wouldn't be very happy if you sat on bonds with their money that were offering crappy interest rate payments compared to higher rates of newly issued bonds. They would sell the current bonds at lower and lower prices until the discount of the old bond gave you an effective yield return similar to the interest rate associated with the newly issued bonds."
2021-04-20 18:12:37,stocks,"I'm not saying that Facebook would beat Apple should Apple decide to compete in the VR wearable world. I have no idea about that. On the other hand, the Oculus Quest 2 is selling like crazy. I have one, and it's a pretty incredible device. Especially for the price. I.e., $300. That's the same price as a Nintendo Switch."
2021-04-20 11:12:53,stocks,"I just bought 10,000 shares. I like their lead product candidate. Company has over $100 million cash. What do you think?"
