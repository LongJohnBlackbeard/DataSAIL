03/31/2021,stocks,"How much the company will earn in the future, and how much I have to pay for those expected earnings.

The stock market is ridiculously complicated, but simplifying into those two spheres helps me make sense of things."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Money

For real. There are so many stocks I like. Sometimes it's hard to decide."
03/31/2021,stocks,Mostly me trying to figure out how the stock markets not a ponzi scheme
03/31/2021,stocks,Not enough information. üòï
03/31/2021,stocks,UBER TWTR TSLA i just ask I‚Äôm 10 years what am i gonna still be using 3 of those stocks you always see but in 10 years those 3 seem obvious now wait until the ‚Äúif you only invested $100 in apple 10 years ago you‚Äôd be rich ‚Äù  those 3 are exactly that in my opinion
03/31/2021,stocks,"The enlightening moment is when you realize it literally is, and the goal is to not be the one left holding the bag in the end."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I don't think this is what OP is looking for, but I have a question regardless. 

Do you even check the prices on those companies?
I mean, sure, all of them might be still around in 10years, but they could still be expensive atm."
03/31/2021,stocks,I like Cresco
03/31/2021,stocks,"Curaleaf, Cresco Labs, Trulieve, Green Thumb, Terascend, Harvest Health, Columbia Care are all companies I maintain long positions as well as MSOS and MSOS options.   $CURLF, $CRBLF, $TCNNF, $TRSSF, $HRVSF, $CCHWF.    

Curaleaf is a solid company same with all the others.  I think all beat earnings except Cura on an accounting technicality.  Solid solid companies to look forward to with good catalysts around the corner regarding legalization.  280E, Safe Banking, Uplisting etc

Search Reddit for CannabisMSOs and #MSOGang

I should note all are traded in the US on OTC markets until US Federal legalization when they can uplist to US Stock Exchange like NYSE etc.   

Now is a good time to get in these stocks as well as most have pulled back 15-30% from ATH.  Big gains were seen today in GTBIF and MSOS and modest gains in the others.  Hope this helps!"
03/31/2021,stocks,SSPK (WeedMaps after the merger) is my largest holding right now.
03/31/2021,stocks,"MO, TAP, STZ. Not pure plays but are positioned well with nationwide distribution already set up and valuable partnerships. Can‚Äôt overlook them. Plus you can get a nice dividend from MO while you wait."

03/31/2021,stocks,how is this post allowed but when I posted about Blackberry mods said it was a meme stock lol
03/31/2021,stocks,"selling stocks to trigger a squeeze is dumb even by wsb standards.

go back to bizarro world where supply and demand runs in reverse"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Possible catalysts include: RC CEO, Margin extension rule coming to an end tomorrow, new. DTCC rules, share recall ahead of their meeting"
03/31/2021,stocks,you really wanted to write so much for April Fool's Day?
03/31/2021,stocks,This sub should probably just ban the word squeeze.
03/31/2021,stocks,Thanks for some sober DD on this stock. The conversation is really toxic and unrealistic right now.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Something doesn‚Äôt make sense though... if it‚Äôs trading above fair value and price plummet is more likely than a squeeze why would DFV be playing the long game, potentially costing him several million dollars. He‚Äôs in this for value. Not because he‚Äôs a fanboy of the company.

What makes him positioned well? He hasn‚Äôt sold a single share or April contract yet. Why would he let go of millions to play the long game. He doesn‚Äôt work at GameStop. He‚Äôs clearly diamond handing for /something/"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Man, what a refreshing sight! It's unfortunate we're so late in the game, but what a wild ride it's been and looks to continue to be!

I'll say this got me back in to stocks and man am I learning a lot! Your streams on Twitch are a perfect learning platform for someone who doesn't know where to start!"
03/31/2021,stocks,When a post is so stupid it can‚Äôt be posted in Wall Street bets or The New Wall Street Bets not even GME sub Reddi. Seriously take this Qnon nonsense somewhere else
03/31/2021,stocks,"Honestly I don't have the attention span to read all this, but thanks for the time it took to research it all. Don't worry about that other guy that said to delete, he's no ape."
03/31/2021,stocks,Agree...if people would sell triggering another crash there could be another squeeze
03/31/2021,stocks,Delete this crap wrong sub
03/31/2021,stocks,So my question to you is gme is very highly shorted right and they must buy the shorts back right so when that time come wouldn‚Äôt that trigger the squeeze
03/31/2021,stocks,If they sell shares they'll lose a majority of their clientele
03/31/2021,stocks,cant wait until part 29 comes out about how we are almost there.
03/31/2021,stocks,Man said 3rd squeeze with chest.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I'm not saying sell, I'm not saying there is any play here, my play is to wait. I'm waiting for an opportunity to jump back in, so are a lot of investors that see this as a growth play when it comes down to a fair price."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Two quick points,

 1) He's already up ~$10 million in realized gains, he's set for life

2) Soon as he sells there is going to be accusations of a pump and dump. Safer to hold until things settle down, he'll still be up 20x or more over his original position"
03/31/2021,stocks,You shouldn't buy a stock because one random person is still holding. Do your own research
03/31/2021,stocks,You realize this is a bear case for GME right?
03/31/2021,stocks,Lol
03/31/2021,stocks,Nah this is some real deal talk. This isn't GME shill land. Did you even read it?
03/31/2021,stocks,Damn. Gme isn't a stock. I knew it!
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yeah so the question is, where are they shorted? No one is holding onto shorts at $5. Those positions were closed out a long time ago. Shorts are now sitting at the $200-350 range. If there is no catalyst to put them underwater, then there is no reason for them to sell and cover. I doubt there are any shorts underwater right now, maybe some who jumped in at $175 and got caught by the bounce, but that's it. 

If your stock was 90% shorted, but all of those shorts had positions that were $100 greater than the current price, they have no reason to close their positions and create a squeeze."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yupp, but they are VERY far in the money right now, so there isn't much time pressure to buy back in. They can slowly rebuy their shorts over the course of days, weeks, or months, and it wouldn't even register with the price."
03/31/2021,stocks,Yeah I covered what a PR nightmare this could be for them in the DD
03/31/2021,stocks,You realize this is a bear case right? And my other posts have been accurate so far?
03/31/2021,stocks,"He already was accused of a pump and dump.
It doesn‚Äôt really hold in court because he acted on public information and advised no one to buy or sell. I don‚Äôt think having 10m dollars suddenly makes a value investor like roaring kitty lose interest in maximizing his value. His investment style is aggressive but backed by research. If you had 10m dollars and a reason to believe you‚Äôll make more you would never just say ‚Äúfuck the rest‚Äù üôÑ that‚Äôs a horrible argument based on no factual data"
03/31/2021,stocks,I‚Äôm not holding because of DFV. I am quoting an argument made by OP and refuting it in the spirit of discussion. Big difference.
03/31/2021,stocks,"And he‚Äôs not one random person. His investment thesis is what brought mass attention to the stock from retail investors. His thesis has proven correct so far. I‚Äôm not investing because of him. I‚Äôm implying he has done his research, followed this from day one, and trust he has also done his research when it comes to when to sell. He‚Äôs not working for the company. He‚Äôs in this for value. I‚Äôm providing a counter argument to OPs implication(s)"
03/31/2021,stocks,Also... GameStop‚Äôs 10K filing exposes that shorts are still a reason for current volatility. To say that shorts covering won‚Äôt be a catalyst is simply dismissive of the entire thesis
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yeah I read it, wouldn't make as much sense to do right now IMO. I would think they would've done that before bringing in the big guns to turn the company around. Would selling shares make them more money than the squeeze?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I honestly did not read it, assumed that every other post I see about it is about how its close to happening or what the catalysts are for it happening or why it has to happen etc and thought this was just another one of them

my apologies"
03/31/2021,stocks,My bad
03/31/2021,stocks,"I mean...yeah. 

If they don't sell shares, then an increase in share price doesn't do anything for them.

Imagine you own 100 shares of XYZ at $100 and it goes up to $1000, it doesn't do anything for you until you press sell. It's the same for them, a short squeeze isn't going to benefit them if they never press the sell button, the only thing they are getting out of it is the free PR which is arguably worth more than the gains they could get from selling."
03/31/2021,stocks,pov: you're holding the bag
03/31/2021,stocks,Upvoted for early April Fools joke.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Earnings expectations are supposed to be a soft lob so companies can look good, it's not a good signal when a company misses like that"
03/31/2021,stocks,"earnings had nothing to do with its downtrend, it started 13 days ago and bearish trend confirmed when it broke below 11.25."
03/31/2021,stocks,I might lose on calls but my average is so low on the shares that I should be fine and end up with a good profit üòÑ
03/31/2021,stocks,"After reading your comment I am really left wondering whether you read the OP or not. 

I have explained the simple reason for the miss.

Canaccord has explained the simple reason for the miss on their own terms and subsequently upgraded the stock. 

Maybe you are trolling me or testing me or else you have no idea what you are talking about. I will just try to move on.

üò•"
03/31/2021,stocks,ok... üëÄ
03/31/2021,stocks,you can't book profit if you don't sell...
03/31/2021,stocks,"I don't really understand how a 10,000% increase in volume moves the price almost zero. People buying their own shares with a seperate brokerage account obviously. Reminds me of the days you could bid up the price on your own ebay items without them catching you!"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I believe there was ETF rebalancing today at the end of trading hours. However, I could be wrong"
03/31/2021,stocks,The volume isn't correct there's another post about it
03/31/2021,stocks,"it's due to a computer glitch at DJI, it's not normal at all."
03/31/2021,stocks,"This is mixing up DOW with DJI(data sources) 

Data gets parsed incorrectly all the time. Json structure changes, someone added a .00 or trailing digits it gets parsed incorrectly or multiplying underlying volume by cost basis so total value traded is listed as volume.

This amount of volume, so abruptly, would have put every system and brokerage down."
03/31/2021,stocks,Because
03/31/2021,stocks,"Since everything is done pretty anonymously in the order books, it will never change. Big money will always stay in power."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Overall I agree, surprisingly little price movement. However, the last 5-10 minutes there was volume equal the daily average trading *every* minute, and the Dow lost about 90 points in the last 5 min."
03/31/2021,stocks,Lol Big tricks here xd
03/31/2021,stocks,"End of quarter pension funds,  legally required to minimize risk,  maga cap etfs, bonds and such.   Big moves in bonds,  gotta sell the other stuff and buy more to keep the correct ratio."
03/31/2021,stocks,link!
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yes, link please :)

Would be the easiest explanation, but can't find anything on /r/stocks at least."
03/31/2021,stocks,Are you sure because I'm seeing this volume number on multiple sites.
03/31/2021,stocks,"That is indeed what has happened. Besides me writing DOW instead of DJI, yahoo seems to display the wrong data with a factor of about a 100.

Thanks, updated post."
03/31/2021,stocks,Good catch!
03/31/2021,stocks,"In other words, it *has* to be because of the supplemental liquidity ratio, right? Because in the last 5 years, nothing like this has ever happened, not even close. March 2020 was the month with most trade volume the last 5 years, at 155 million. The entire month of March 2020, 155 million vs a single day with 418 million. 

What I don't understand is why there's just no information about this(that I could find). Financial news write articles about how tweets of ice cream cones move markets, but nothing about this historic anomaly."
03/31/2021,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhgkfx/what_the_fuck_just_happened_at_the_close_of/gsyqyvx/ i think is what OP is referring to
03/31/2021,stocks,"yes, show us the way with a link."
03/31/2021,stocks,other systems take the numbers automatically from it
03/31/2021,stocks,"I'm with you, I'm looking everywhere and can't find any decent information about this.  The volume was historic in a matter of minutes."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I really don't have a deep understanding of the internal workings of banks,  but I thought the SLR was unique to banks and other large financial institutions.   Something about federal treasury bonds not counting against the banks for their leverage ratio (the part i don't understand), but now they will be so they need to keep more capital. 

My limited understanding of Pensions is that they are only allowed to invest in very safe things and maintain a certain percentage in extremely safe bonds,  when that ratio is unbalanced,  they sell one and buy the other to restore it."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Thanks, seems like yahoo mixed up their data. Edited post."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I see, where did you get this info? Not questioning you since volume is unrealistic"
03/31/2021,stocks,you're not obligated to.
03/31/2021,stocks,"You should never ever be exercising the option, you want to sell it at its maximum value but never let it actually reach the option expiry date while you still have it."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Call/Put primer:

All options use units of shares. a unit is 100 shares. there is no smaller amount

Buying a call: you are purchasing the right, but not the obligation, to buy a unit of stock at a set price (the strike price). to purchase this right, you pay a premium amount per share. you pay this no matter if you execute or not. 

Buying a put: you are purchasing the right, but not the obligation, to sell a unit of stock at a set price. Same as above, you pay a premium for this right. Many people consider buying a put to be ""price insurance"" you are protecting gains or profits if you think volatility is in the winds. 

the above have their other party counter parts:

Selling a call, also called a covered call, is when you are the person providing the shares for a call. You collect the premium the individual paid to buy a call. This premium is yours to keep no matter what. However, if the contract is executed, you must sell your shares. 

Selling a put: you are the one that buys the shares from the person that buys the put option. like the call above, you collect the premium, but if the share price hits the strike price, you must buy the shares, even if it keeps on tanking."
03/31/2021,stocks,"With an option you are never obigated to buy or sell.  Hence the name option. You can sell it, you can excercise it, you can let it expire."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Cheers, it's only ever if I have written the option myself?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Correct.  The important difference to note is that in the case you mentioned, you are **selling to close** rather than **selling to open**.  

When you sell to open, you have written an option, and may get assigned if the buyer exercises the option.

When you sell to close, you are just leaving the transaction."
03/31/2021,stocks,"If you ‚ÄúBuy to Open‚Äù you‚Äôll never be on the hook for exercising the option. You can exercise it yourself, but no other person in the market can."
03/31/2021,stocks,"if you own underlying then you're obligated to as you're the seller of the call option but you're collecting a premium from the buyer.

03/31/2021,stocks,"Thank you, cleared it up"
03/31/2021,stocks,"You run the risk of not filling at all if you set a stop limit order, remember there must be a buyer to match your price. Even a market order may not fill if no one is buying."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Never, ever place market orders. 

It sounds like you want to place a stop loss in case the stock gets below a certain pint so you can sell your share. 

Even when buying stock though, never buy with market orders, always use limit orders."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yeah, that's what I was thinking as well. I'm so confused on what happens in this specific situation but I can't see to think of any better of an idea other than set a market order for open and hope for the best."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I get what you are saying. I thought that in the beginning as well. But, If the news breaks on Sunday. I am 100% certain and without a single shred of doubt that the stock will plunge to the absolute bottom. So, I feel like a MArket order is the safer bet here as I am willing to sell at literally the highest possible price no matter how low it is."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Hi. I made quiet a few ""Market"" orders to but some stocks in the beginning. This ugh... isn't gonna screw me now, right? Just when I bought them? Smh.... I've learned so much!!!"
03/31/2021,stocks,"This is correct, never ever set market orders, theres absolutely no reason to do so, you can easily check the bid/ask spread and set something you're comfortable with in that range. Even if you are buying an ETF or something you are gonna not look at for 20 years, there's literally no reason not to do something that takes 2 seconds of extra work."
03/31/2021,stocks,"A market order will fill at whatever buy is in line, could be higher or lower then what else is out on list but a market is more likely to fill quickly."
03/31/2021,stocks,Wouldn't that require a market order? and not a stop loss? Wouldn't placing a market order pretty much be the exact same thing as placing a stop loss at the very highest price?
03/31/2021,stocks,Hey! Please understand that the market is not opened on the weekends and tomorrow is the last trading day of the week. The US observes Good Friday this week in anticipation of Easter Sunday.
03/31/2021,stocks,No. Market orders are fine if the bid price and ask price are close together. I dont use market orders but to say 'never use market orders' is too much of a generalization.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I'm not saying you are wrong. But, if I did anything other than a market order what would stop it from simply not executing and then me being stuck holding the bag waiting on an order that might never be filled?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Right...  So... in this ""frantic sell off grab whatever you can"" scenario a market order at open would be a much smarter thing to do rather than a stop Limit or Stop loss? Would you agree? Sorry... I'm just trying to make sure I do the right thing."
03/31/2021,stocks,"So, what would you do in that situation?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Phewwwww!!! Thank you! Yeah, looking back at what I PAID to buy those shares, I knew I messed up somewhere. Thanks for the info"
03/31/2021,stocks,"If you are trying to set up a limit sell, you look at where the price is and try to set it somewhere below the range its trading at. If you use something other than WS or a bank broker, you can set stop losses for situations like that where there's bad news and a sell off."
03/31/2021,stocks,"It‚Äôs whatever you‚Äôre comfortable with, a market order will fill at whatever price someone is buying at (but again needs a buyer so may not fill) and you risk selling for a very very low price. A stop limit will trigger a sale and only sale at your set price or higher (but also if no buyer it won‚Äôt process) so it‚Äôs whatever your risk tolerance is. If you‚Äôre just looking to get out and save some capital then a market order will do fine"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I am holding several thousand shares. Its basically a call option for me, all or nothing. But if I were you, set a trailing stop limit % based on last. Good till canceled. Do you know how trailing stop limits work?"
03/31/2021,stocks,I bought in for 0.025 and the price is currently at 0.707. Let's say the we get bad news Tonight and I place a market order for open tomorrow. Could it potentially sell for under 0.025? Is that likely?
03/31/2021,stocks,"It‚Äôs unlikely but still possible, the order will fill at whatever a buyer purchases it at, there‚Äôs no guarantee in stocks."
03/31/2021,stocks,You have been very helpful. Thank you so much
03/31/2021,stocks,Anytime!
03/31/2021,stocks,"I like this stock also. Building a position as opposed to taking an outright huge positions given where the overall market is. Good analysis. Just remember there is more than numbers. Partnerships, Mgmt, business sectors, etc. it‚Äôs not all apples to apples"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I like your thinking although paysafe's margins are lower and the margin for growth is also lower. But even with that taken into account and with a greater possible TAM ( so more growth as projected hopefully ), and revenue projection outperformances. I have a pt of 25-30 for this stock by the end of **2022 (** with an outperformance target of 40 dollars if the sports betting legalisation is accelerated across the  US )"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Watch Bill Foley‚Äôs interview on mad money from Monday and you can see they have massive plans here. Already hugely established in I-gaming, gambling (including draft kings), and cryp-to (including coinbase). And planning to expand with Foley in Vegas to ‚Äúcashless casinos.‚Äù Their partnerships are legit and they are announcing new ones weekly it seems like, big revenue ($1.5 billion) and great margins, the board is highly credible with heavy hitters, and Foley mentioned that they are now deleveraged and have some nice deals they are far along in working out. This is my number 1 play for 2021 and I‚Äôm loaded big. I really cannot see any major downside from current price in my opinion. If this went IPO instead of s-pac route, this would have been listed over $50 and likely soared over $100 immediately (as all these ridiculous IPOs seem to do).

03/31/2021,stocks,"This is not entirely correct. They said they are projecting 11% based on the entire fintech market at large.  They said they are doing this to be conservative, excluding M&A plans and iGaming growth potential in the US.  Also, other fintechs that have much higher multiples, have slower or similar growth.  For example, Shift4 reported only 4% y-o-y grwoth, Fiserv projects only 5% CAGR going forward while GPN's growth projection is on par with  Paysafe's. Meanwhle Paysafe's margins are growth faster than competitors like PayPal."

03/31/2021,stocks,Yay! More inflation!!!
03/31/2021,stocks,"The increase in corporate taxes will reduce earnings by 9%.  That is not good.  What is worse is that Trump's corporate tax rate makes perfect sense.  It lowered U.S. corporate taxes to a bit below the average  corporate tax rate in OECD countries, which is 23%, making the U.S. more competitive.  It is sad the typical mouth breather can only turn this into ""tax cuts for the rich"" rather than facilitation of more job creation.

Another way to look at this is that reduction in earning will reduce stock prices.  Over a ten year period with returns sans dividends of averaging \~9% this will take away roughly one year of returns.  It is not just corporations that will take the hit.  It will be everyone who saves their money and tries to improve their lives by investing, and it will be a pretty big hit."

03/31/2021,stocks,"So yes, the other way of doing it is making everyone happy enough that they will pass it.Or make constituents so angry that you won't pass it. 

My Politics aside, Republicans were typically happy to thwart Obama at every chance to simply push their re-election hopes. However, the republicans were more organized and disciplined under Obama.  Currently the republicans have weak leadership, Trump who seems to be more interested in profiting off of his working class base, and Mitch McConnel who will do or say anything for  power, or short term gains.

Add to this a democratic party  who is trying to shape the midterms as Republicans are do nothings, look what we did and I don't think we know how it will play out.

Its seem to me very easy for republicans to fall back into their prior   habit of being opposition to X because of Y (spending, Ethics, Immigration, Q ) .

However, I bought CLF when Biden was running as a Cheap way to play this position. I think it has already run up on the ""plan"", and  should be considered overpriced  or fairly priced for its financials and that anything more then 19.5 should be considered speculating on something passing."

Nio, Li, and Xpeng won‚Äôt benefit for another few years at minimum. The credit will minimally affect EV sales for Porsche and Lucid since those cars cost so much that 10k doesn‚Äôt mean much. Companies like VW, Tesla, and Ford will be affected the most by the credit (in a good way)"
03/31/2021,stocks,Exactly. I think MP will do well whether this plan passes or not. US needs to be independent for their own good or get rekt. MP to $50 by EOY (conservative PT haha).

03/31/2021,stocks,They can do budget reconciliation for FY2022 which starts in October. This bill will pass with 51 votes in September as part of next years government budget probably.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Someone else mentioned that this will count towards FY2022, but I don't think that zero republican support should be a starting point. Infrastructure spending is incredibly popular, and I heard on (I think) NPR today that there is talk about bringing earmarks back. Basically it was a way for politicians to carve out money directly for their local district or state, and led to more bipartisan bills because individual politicians could get something that directly benefitted them politically. 

They were phased out because of their ability (and specific cases) of being used for corruption, but I could see earmarks making a comeback to get this bill done. There are still too many dem senators not on board with abolishing the filibuster, plus it would open the door for republicans to do the same and do whatever they wanted if they win a trifecta again, and simple reform will literally just waste everyone's time.

I think if democrats are willing to compromise on maybe reducing the amount allocated for clean energy and move it towards job retraining, slim it down by 5-10%, add in some earmarks, and allow republicans to trot out their moderates and vulnerable seats for a victory lap, this could pass without reconciliation. Thing is though, democrats have the upper hand in that they could ignore any demands and push it through reconciliation anyways. So really it comes down to whether the compromise is small and targeted enough to politically benefit 10 individual republicans senators, while also being big enough to satisfy the entire spectrum of democratic senators."

03/31/2021,stocks,"Oh yeah, I totally agree with you, I just didn't know Biden had uranium in his plan or anything"
03/31/2021,stocks,"It deleted my other comment cuz I linked an SA article (rightly so). Basically I agree with you though the plan is good news for EV and the next decade will be huge in general.

03/31/2021,stocks,Yeah I don‚Äôt expect any return for 5-10 years so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm keeping it at <1%. Elon has stated he won‚Äôt IPO SpaceX but Starlink is a possibility.
03/31/2021,stocks,"You can use reconciliation once per fiscal budget year. The stimulus covered the current fiscal year. The next government fiscal year begins in Oct 2021, so this bill will count towards the government budget beyond October."
03/31/2021,stocks,"You can effectively use budget reconciliation once for a fiscal year.

Technically you could pass 3 if each bill once impacted just one of major topics of reconciliation (respectively): revenue, spending, and the federal debt limit.

However, any major budget reconciliation will impact all 3, so you effectively get one.

FY2021 was the American Rescue Plan

FY2022 is Infrastructure (can be passed now)"
03/31/2021,stocks,"You‚Äôre right, but apparently Schumer is trying to find a work around to somehow get reconciliation up to 3 times a year."
03/31/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/31/2021,stocks,Reconciliation basically covers anything that affects revenue/spending. I‚Äôm not an expert on the specific rules of reconciliation but I was impressed they managed to get most of the provisions of the stimulus so I‚Äôd say they will get this to work as well.
03/31/2021,stocks,It's not. It would be great if it was but Americans are still highly resistant to it on a cultural level. Hope that changes soon though!
03/31/2021,stocks,I think energy fuels (UUUU) is a part of his plan. Energy Fuels is American Uranium.

03/31/2021,stocks,"Do you know if that means that the operational aspects of the bill won't be effective until FY2022 (Oct)? Or simply that the reconciliation applies to FY2022, so they cant use it again for that FY?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Ehhh not exactly. They‚Äôre trying to get it to 3 times a year by interpreting reconciliation in a way that has never happened before. Ultimately, it will be up to the parliamentarian to either grant or deny the process."

They LIKELY will not have issues with semiconductor shortages (planes are giant computers nowadays) because aviation regulation is so slow, they‚Äôve likely bought a 50 year supply of 2005-era CPU‚Äôs for today‚Äôs production.This is what they did with the 777 during its production. They bought enough processors to last half a century and the tech was already outdated. 

Another plane crash of significant caliber would likely damage Boeing a lot, but again, I‚Äôve been in aviation for 20+ years and we all know the best time to buy airline stocks is right after a plane crash. Sick but true.

Government contracts are the other boon to Boeing. 

I will say one thing I do not like about Boeing, and this is from a personal preference standpoint. I‚Äôve worked on the 727, 757, 767, and 777. I‚Äôm not impressed by the engineering. I find a general lack of redundancy, poor follow through on design principles, a lack of technical information, and poor quality control on airplanes new from the factory. I don‚Äôt expect any of that to be worth anything regarding the stock price, but I feel like Airbus makes a superior product albeit generally more expensive.

03/31/2021,stocks,"Alaska just put in an order for a bunch of 737MAX-8, the aircraft are deemed airworthy now, I think the bad sentiment will reduce.

As the Covid situation gets better internationally, more companies will want to take immediate delivery, get on the order queue and increase aircraft utilization.

The cool thing about the MAX is that it can do routes that the previous generation 737NG were incapable of doing, this can be extremely profitable and lucrative for airlines when it comes to optimizing their fleet.

They also have the 777X waiting to be sold which I believe will be the replacement aircraft for fleets that are looking to retire 747‚Äôs and 380‚Äôs."
03/31/2021,stocks, I expect BA to do well
03/31/2021,stocks,"Apologies, but your post is all speculation, based on how you think this industry works and not how it actually works.  The order book for planes are usually placed 8-10 years in advance (it takes that long to build an aircraft).  This industry is dominated by two and only two OEMs (airbus and Boeing), it is quite literally a duopoly.  Every single plane you‚Äôll ever fly on is one or the other.

In fact after the two max crashes, Airbus could hardly gain off BA‚Äôs misfortune, because they already had orders at full capacity.  And within a year or two more, the public will completely forget about the max crashes that it wouldn‚Äôt hurt them in the long term in the least.  

IMO Boeing‚Äôs stock will reach its peak within this next year or two."
03/31/2021,stocks,"‚ÄúThey have zero deliverables, plans...‚Äù

Actually LUV just ordered multiple planes from BA. And they have already ‚Äúlifted off‚Äù no pun intended. 

Please fact check before you post"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I would agree with you if they actually had some competition. I don‚Äôt think most airlines will just stop and make the switch to airbus. There is incentive to buy American. Customers will continue to take Boeing planes. No one is paying more for a plane ticket just to be on an airbus instead of a Boeing.

But yes, they have fat legal liability sitting on their books now."
03/31/2021,stocks,For what reasons?
03/31/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/31/2021,stocks,"I agree, but you also got to look at the lifecycle of a Boeing plane and the slow path to recovery. Boeing undergoes huge debt coming into each plane they build. 

However, the improvements on each new plane in recent years is extremely marginal, and their lifecycle is ~20-30 years. 

With travel still low and expected to stay low, it‚Äôs a difficult hole to climb out of, especially when airliners already have Boeing and airbus planes and have little reasons to upgrade (only reason to upgrade is due to hitting the 30 year life cycle or their plane usage is so high that the economy of better gas mileage is more beneficial with a MAX plane). The MAX is also almost the same exact tech as the planes they delivered 20-30 years ago. Heavily invested startups are working on making hypersonic and electric planes. Boeing is not, and they don‚Äôt have the money to do so. Layoffs are high.

TLDR: Boeing is not an airliner. They are in massive debt. They sell planes. Nobody needs planes, and they won‚Äôt for a while. They are only down 18% in share price on the two-year. They are overvalued."

I figured huge gain after those numbers.  

The only 2 analysts I‚Äôve seen that have updated since earnings maintained their ‚Äúbuy‚Äù rating, with targets of 380 and 450.

03/31/2021,stocks,"22 Billion. 
On VR? 
You're pulling my leg right?"
03/31/2021,stocks," 
1. The contract has been executed. If Microsoft were to pull back at this point, they would be non-compliant. In the gov contracting world, that can be a problem. 


2. The employees in question probably don't even work on the contract because they seem to be shocked at this production contract. There was a dev contract before this one and software just doesn't build itself. If they are line employees, they probably don't have any rights to their intellectual property anyway. 


3. It's a multi billion dollar firm fixed price contract with a base period of 5 years. There's no way any executive is going to let this one go, unless the army decides not to order. But again, firm fixed price is much better than say, an IDIQ, which guarantees you little to no revenue, but gives a lofty ceiling to hope for. 


4. From a market standpoint, they had a prototype contract before this one, so Microsoft already had revenue coming in on this product before today. So the advantage here is the delta between revenue on the old and new contract and a stable revenue stream for at least 5 years, provided no contract mods happen that would reduce the quantity of product ordered over the next 5 years. 


With all that said, Microsoft is a behemoth of a company and 21.8 billion over 10 years is like a ""normal"" company winning a 100 million dollar contract. Microsoft should be in business and profitable for many years to come and I don't think buying into Microsoft poses much risk, with or without this contract. 


*I am not a financial advisor. I do not work at Microsoft, nor do I own the stock. Just my personal opinion."

03/31/2021,stocks,How much of that is due to Nadella and how much of it is that we are in a raging tech bull market though? A little more column B than A methinks.

But I like Disney‚Äôs growth prospects and the company vision better if I‚Äôm choosing between the two. Apple may struggle to find her footing over the next 5 years while Disney has the pedal on the floor imo.

Apples a great brand but it feels too close to fashion styles and fashion can be fickle over the long haul."
03/31/2021,stocks,"So I own shares in all three companies, and I remember looking at Disney at 205 thinking I should sell, but Disney Plus is a huge win for them, and they did it in a fraction of the time Netflix had their same growth. Granted it will top out in the life cycle, but adding STAR gives them more wide viewing then the Disney Core.   


Combine that with their theme parks being 6 in the top 8 I believe for yearly attendance and their ownership positions in  the media companies they own and Disney is  a great long term hold.  


I expect/want/would if I was Apple to roll into health care with hospitals. The technology they have, cloud base, interactive programs, custom built database. AI technology that takes information from doctors and spits out probable clauses.

03/31/2021,stocks,"Just because I'm picky about these things, PACB is not a ""gene"" sequencing company. They are a DNA sequencing company, and at the moment their long-read sequencing technology enables better detection in genomic structural variants, indels, long non-coding regions, repetitive regions (centromeric, transposons, LINES, SINES, etc) than other NGS methods, which are not the traditional protein coding ""genes"" that people tend to refer to. This is what makes them unique from other NGS platforms (e.g. ILMN), and competitive in private and public sectors that use whole genome sequencing."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Well, if your researching biotech stocks and you want to research an interesting play that is in good financial shape, I would suggest you take a look at Regeneron (REGN). 

It's also in ARKG, so you know right-off there is something there and while I don't make recommendations, anything around $470 looks like a good price from my perspective.  

Good luck and I believe the more research you do before making an investment helps reduced the stress that invariable shows-up, when an investment declines in value.  Not every investment needs to be a short-term winner and some investments never pan out.  I would also note, that biotech in general is typically volatile and some would say too risky.  If your risk adverse, I would suggest also looking at Amgen (AMGN), but AMGN is on the opposite side of the risk/reward curve from REGN.  Full disclosure I own REGN and I'm looking to get back into AMGN at the right price."

03/31/2021,stocks,We live in the Netherlands and she does not trade in stocks. She said she has no idea lol
03/31/2021,stocks,"Well, i already said that i like the CEO but didnt really get into it.

Christian Henry is the new CEO of PACB since august 2020 and worked more than 20 years in life science industry. He worked as an executive at Illumina for 12 years, the biggest competition for PACBIO. He understands how he needs to work with growing companies and also knows how important it is to expand, how important marketing is and he knows how to negotiate. You might think that thats normal for a CEO but in my expierence this is not the case at all.

What I also like about the management is that they understand that if you are listed on the stockmarket, you have to make changes. Its very easy to see their numbers, their reports are good to read, their presentations and events are public and most important for me: Their incredibly difficult products are pretty easy to follow.

I learned SO many things from their presentations and Q&A's.

This might be expected from a company who is listed on the stock market but still. Its nice.

About their product i didnt include the difference between long and short sequencing. Because i have not written it down anywhere yet and also because i cant tell the entire story. But in short:

The short read sequencing is not able to read full range of genetic variations, while the long read is able to find singe base and structural varations. This means basicly that the discovery of genes that cause disease could be easier found.

So not only has PACBIO long read sequencing and their biggest competitor short sequencing, PACBIO also has HI-FI sequencing. Which is more effici√´nt and more accurate than the existing long sequencing.

The only down side is that obviously competitors are also evolving, and before PacBio can make big profits, there is already a new sequencing product that is better than the flagship product PacBio has right now."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Also, the only reason they are showing a positive net income for this year of 30M is that they sold 125M of their new shares. It's not unusual for the companies in that industry and at that stage to finance themselves with new issues, but they are pushing it to the extreme."

03/31/2021,stocks,I'm a big fan of hydrogen. There's less waste (batteries are hard and expensive to recycle) and it's easier to store hydrogen in a tank than energy in some expensive metals
03/31/2021,stocks,"my biggest concern is that hydrogen has been around a LONG time and never really gained any traction, where as EV's are starting to look like they could actually become mainstream.

the fact that someone only has to really worry about where they'll charge an EV if they're doing a long trip is a major advantage. if i have a hydrogen powered vehicle and i do a 15-20 minute commute every day, eventually i have to refill it and there may or may not be a station that sells hydrogen in my area. (i've personally never seen one).

with an ev, if i do a 15-20 minute daily commute, i literally never have  to make a special trip to refill and can just charge at my house every night.

the vast majority of driving is going to fall into the range covered by an EV  without having to stop to recharge. this GREATLY minimizes how much infrastructure is actually needed for them to take off."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Hydrogen vehicles are just EVs with a hydrogen fuel cell that makes electricity. Electricity is the common currency, so why tie yourself into only one way of producing it?"

03/31/2021,stocks,"In the simplest terms think of it like this, EV is gasoline Hydrogen is diesel.

Gasoline runs things like cars, chainsaws, small generators, small boats. and that‚Äôs gonna be EV or lithium batteries.

Diesel runs things like large trucks, construction equipment, commercial boats and that stuff is going to be hydrogen or fuel cells.

They both have pluses and minuses, you are never gonna have a commuter car or a bass boat run on hydrogen it just isn‚Äôt practical much in the same way as having an EV powered backhoe or tugboat isn‚Äôt."
03/31/2021,stocks,"EV makes the most sense to me, its hard to beat the convenience of being able to plug in your car at home and if thats the case the economies of scale from cars should drive down truck batteries as well."
03/31/2021,stocks,"hydrogen is not going to be more than a niche fuel on the ground for specific and limited applications

The battery technology that exist today or in the near future like QS is enough to power all sorts of vehicles for as much as human can drive. All the infrastructure required is already there you just need to install some more charging points, which The new infrastructure plan will take care off. 

In contrast, you still need to develop the whole hydrogen generation and transport infrastructure, and do so safely for it to be useful. Even with the idea of onboard hydrogen generator is still years to come in any practical form.

Most EV users on the other hand can just plug at home, and those traveling will find superchargers and charge points much more available before they could find a hydrogen station.


It may be useful in planes, but the technology for that doesn‚Äôt seem to exist at least in the near future, none of the big plane makers is demonstrating any ready technology to have commercial planes fueled by hydrogen. 

My guess is that hydrogen is gonna go the way plasma TV or the HD-DVD, it will be touted for a while, may even sell a specific vehicle or two, before battery technology kill it once and for all"

03/31/2021,stocks,Hydrogen vehicles wont ever make it to the public. You know how in GTA when you shoot the gas cap the whole car explodes? Pretty how it would go down with hydrogen fuel
03/31/2021,stocks,"If you do a bit of DD, look at the amount of excess electricity capacity of the generating stations.   Typically limited to 105% to 108% of peak demand.   Then look at the size of EV batteries in KW and multiply that times the number of BEVs you expect.   Is there a delta?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"As far as stock go I can't say.  I like the idea of hydrogen in the future, whoever looks makes it a reality first will be a good play.  Then as the tech develops whoever makes the best cars will be a good play long term.   I think long distance vehicles are the bigger market, so Over the road trucking, luxury SUV's, and delivery van's - think FedEx etc."

03/31/2021,stocks,I was only really thinking about it for big trucks.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Bet it had something to do with realizing that the amount of charging they wanted exceeded the capacity of the power lines going to their sites, and the utility quoting them an outrageous number of dollars to run higher power lines off a dedicated substation that would need to be built but wouldn't be done for a few years since everyone fights to keep bigger power lines and substations away from their backyard (NIBY)."
03/31/2021,stocks,Yeah i have and it all sounds and looks great.
03/31/2021,stocks,Are fuel cells easy to recycle? Or are they meant to outlast batteries?
03/31/2021,stocks,"So it‚Äôs at least partially a use-case argument? 

EV good for shorter and predictable journeys and if you have a charging station at home/your destination.

H2 good for longer journeys and if you have a h2 station in your area/your destination area."
03/31/2021,stocks,How come it‚Äôs not practical to run smaller items from hydrogen? Are the fuel cells required too big?
03/31/2021,stocks,"There is an old website that stopped updating in 2013 or so, but it's still available.   ""Do the math "" was it's name (sorry I don't know how to link in reddit). Anyway,  the guy was as big a fan of green as you'll find,  but he's also a physics professor.   Did a bunch of calculations on green tech, maximum power output of a solar panel, energy storage,  that sort of stuff.   You might be interested.   Especially batteries, look at the size of the ones in an electric car 82 KW in the model 3.  How many additional power generation stations would you need to charge say in Ohio,  total number of cars is about 4,380,000 so if 25% were electric let's round down to one million BEVs?  

Do you have any idea how long it takes to build that kind of capacity? 

Wind/solar need storage,  which is why i recommend ""do the math"".

03/31/2021,stocks,"""Toulouse, 21 September 2020 - Airbus has revealed three concepts for the world‚Äôs first zero-emission commercial aircraft which could enter service by 2035."""
03/31/2021,stocks,I think it's the opposite. Amazon is covering all of those warehouses with solar panels. My FC generates so much power that we sell it. We also don't own any of that equipment. It's all rentals so swapping them out probably doesn't cost all that much. Like I said though I don't know because I'm not in that loop.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Cell size is part of it but some of the main advantages of hydrogen are quick charge times, stability in extreme weather and you don‚Äôt need a lot of amps or volts to charge and once a it‚Äôs charged it stays charged. Some of the disadvantages are size, not a whole lot of infrastructure and honestly it‚Äôs more expensive right now. So if  stability in extreme weather and quick recharging and the ability to take a charge and sit idle for a indefinite period of time isn‚Äôt critical why pay for it or deal with the hassle."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Actually you may be surprised that it won‚Äôt turn out that way for a couple of reasons. 

The capacity of the grids present now is designed for the peak usage time, and that is without any storage capacity for later use, so the number of generators and all the wiring and such is caliberated for that time where we have peak usuals, but we aren‚Äôt at the peak all day, so the added EV burden doesn‚Äôt need the electricity at the peak time. 


most EVs will end up in garages charging overnight, well after everyone is in bed, all the washers and dryers, TVs and such are not working, and the need for air conditioning is lowest in the summe. But the EVs will basically utilize the unused grid capacity at the time where we don‚Äôt need it.


The other reason is roof top solar, for most suburban home, a solar roof with current existing technology will generate enough electricity for the house to run, including EV usage, that is true for my Tesla and my house. 

If you have two EVs in one house solar is going to be a logical choice, especially with a government pushing for solar through tax incentives, and once you have that, you are not only offsetting the EVs burden without any grid addition, you will need less grid, who becomes essentially an emergency system for houses with good solar capacity. 

So we really won‚Äôt to build a huge infrastructure in the traditional sense."
03/31/2021,stocks,"The production of hydrogen is highly inefficient compared to battery tech. Not to mention safety concerns with fueling hydrogen and containing it in tanks for easy transport. If it was a liquid no problem it be a simple swap with gasoline. Hydrogen though is a gas and must be kept under pressurized tanks. That should immediately send red flags. Now back to how its inefficient. Hydrogen is made through a process called electrolysis. Which is the process of taking salt water add a negative and positive pole then provide am electrical current and whalaaah you have a separation of the hydrogen and oxygen molecule that is then converted into electricity by your hydrogen car which recombines hydrogen with oxygen (simple explanation) and you expel water out your exhaust. From source to usage you lose half the efficiency. More if its transferred through the transmission to the driveshaft to the wheels. 

Now add the usage of fossil fuels to produce this ‚Äúclean‚Äù energy. 

Thus I side with tesla. As legacy autos continue to show their incompetence with the future of evs in this world. 

But what about the other companies that are not legacy auto? 

They will still have to follow the same path as legacy autos. Not as harsh since theyre starting right out the gate with barely any debt and only ev platform cars. 

But whos going to want those cars when tesla will have the advantages of an integrated network that will be able to lower the cost on its products with ease / the golden standard on manufacturing / the best battery tech ie: 4680 tabless battery / best performance and range stats / #1 accident safety stats / most user friendly car app and app store / a ceo that tweets back / personal charging station / etc. 

Oh yeah now what if your car could drive its self?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I don't have any actual knowledge, but I will say that Solar is a poor fit for BEVs without storage (double the number of batteries) and really doesn't generate enough power compared to what you need. Do the math, calculate solar output per meter, how much area is the top of a warehouse and the KW for BEVs times the number of BEVs."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I saw it as the opposite tbh, EV will never charge as fast as you can fill a tank. I think this is better for more industrial and commerical use. Trucks can charge overnight or while the driver is resting. Hydrogen is more for the consumer as it's easier and faster to top up hydrogen and the infrastructure for refuelling hydrogen is there. Old Patrol Stations can be repurposed into Hydrogen refuelling. 

What do you think?"
03/31/2021,stocks,Great straightforward explanation thank you
03/31/2021,stocks,"Thank you for this, I‚Äôm very new to this debate and am genuinely trying to learn and get a view beyond red team vs blue team. I know there‚Äôs upsides and downsides to both but I‚Äôm trying to discern them in an impartial way.

Have you heard of this hydrogen ‚Äúgrey goop‚Äù innovation which can store liquid hydrogen? Could that be a game changer? I guess the argument becomes which is more preferable, solids vs liquids vs gas. 

Is it fair to say the crux of your argument that the hydrogen economy for cars is adding too many steps to the process? A process which is already streamlined and in place with electric vehicles?

The only thing I‚Äôm sceptical about what you say is concerning fossil fuels. Yes fossil fuels are used to generate hydrogen at the moment in some cases, but that‚Äôs also the case with electricity for EV‚Äôs right?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Could be. Our building is single story and right at 1 million sq feet, the roof is almost completely covered, and we have over 200 PIT. The guys that completed the connection to the panels told me we had excess."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Excess for a building sure, but those BEV batteries are huge.   82 KW just for a single model 3."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Ideally you‚Äôd have a number in mind that you think is fair value. Or, you think of a return you‚Äôre targeting before you buy (10, 20, 30%) and if the security hits that point, you can evaluate and trim a position or see if your thesis has changed in light of new information. Personally, I buy stocks I plan to hold for a very long time, so I don‚Äôt have this issue but if they somehow ran up a huge amount I‚Äôd definitely evaluate like the process I outlined above."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I owned AAPL for many years, and trimmed it down every year or so it wasn't such a big % of my portfolio. Which looking back was a huge mistake, the 20k profit I trimmed 10 years ago would be a lifechanging amount now. If it still a strong stock and you think it will go up, I would hesitate to trim unless you can find a better alternative."
03/31/2021,stocks,No things are dynamic - every day companies change. SQ at $500 is unlikely to be same company at $200. If you truly believe in a company and theres no better alternative to invest in let it ride.
03/31/2021,stocks,typically start thinking of selling when I get to 30% positive return but I'm also an active trader and I would cut out when a stock starts turning on me - you should be able to read price and the tape and technically able to read a chart.
03/31/2021,stocks,Usually people sell stock when they feel the valuation of the shares what they thought they should trade at.  Things change and the valuation target may increase or decrease .  I would sell when the valuation target has been reached
03/31/2021,stocks,"If it‚Äôs a short term hold, I sell the tax advantaged lots after 1 year.  However, if there‚Äôs a huge run up where price 2x before then, I‚Äôll liquidate 50% to essentially reduce cost basis to 0.

Long term holds, depends on portfolio balancing and whether the company has changed."
03/31/2021,stocks,Make a plan on when / how to sell when you buy it.
03/31/2021,stocks,Seems like you have come up with a plan on when to sell SQ.  Why couldn't you come up with a similar plan for the other two?
03/31/2021,stocks,I also only buy stocks I plan to hold for a very long time. Ideally I would hold these three for 20+ years. But people keep recommending you make a plan from day one anyway.
03/31/2021,stocks,"That's good advice, thank you!"
03/31/2021,stocks,This... patience PAYS.
03/31/2021,stocks,"$500/share and I'll be trimming isn't really a plan, though I guess it could be. I had hoped for something more concrete, like ""trim 30% every time it doubles"" or something. Something that has worked for folks in the past, allowing them to ride any upswing while also reducing risk."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yeah I think I‚Äôve seen a lot of ideas similar to the ones I detailed. I usually do DCF analysis and tinker with baseline assumptions to get a sense of run-off value in case the business never grew again, and then adjust assumptions from there to see a range."

03/31/2021,stocks,"You can't buy on margin if you don't have margin before you buy. When you trade naked you have two days to provide funds to settle. That's different. (And if you decide to just sell instead of funding you're free-riding which can get you in big trouble).

You usually get a margin call long before your account is at zero margin.  When your account margin goes below the maintenance requirement, the call requests that you put enough in to bring it back up to the requirement, or sell enough shares so that the margin in your account now meets the margin requirement.

If you don't sell shares, then the cash that you put in to cover a margin call is still your cash. It doesn't get used to pay for anything. It's there as collateral, because your other collateral was shares and the value of those shares dropped but the value of the debt did not.

You can use that cash to buy marginable securities (stocks that are high enough quality that they can be used as collateral). Since the shares that dropped are now discounted and you think they're still worth holding, you can buy more of those if you like."

I‚Äôm a big proponent of personal responsibility, HOWEVER companies shouldn‚Äôt make it so easy to use Margin without some kind of test or education requirement from their customers.

03/31/2021,stocks,"Yeah I heard about that. I thought I knew how it worked. I only applied so I could trade spreads. Then started buying shares during the covid crash thinking I would only use margin when my cash ran out.

03/31/2021,stocks,"This is one of the dumber posts I‚Äôve seen this week. 

Is this how one does valuations these days, by comparing what may happen two years down the road to one of the best companies of all time by only talking about gross margins? 

Why should Palantir be compared with Google?

Also most software companies have high gross margins. If gross margins are all that matters Alteryx had 92% in 2020, compared to 67% for Palantir. 

What about Palantir deciding to randomly invest in a flying taxi start up? If growth is so astronomical why not invest it back into the company?"
03/31/2021,stocks,Are you basing the ‚Äúbest business to ever exist‚Äù on its gross margin?
03/31/2021,stocks,Is PLTR profitable after being around for 17-18 years? What‚Äôs the P/S ratio for PLTR? Not to mention the business is laughably so different than GOOG. GOOG basically invented the monetization model for search engines and you see this everywhere online now.

You clearly have no idea how this shit works. You are looking at two TOTALLY different business models with google and palantir."
03/31/2021,stocks,I don't quite think this is the right way to do this because these companies are in completely diffrent industries. Palantir relies on large but scarce contracts while Google relises on advertising.

Gross margins are one part of the story. If they were the only part, then PLTR wouldn‚Äôt have been unprofitable for the last 17 years. Their free cash flow was -300m in 2020.

This is why people do DCF analysis instead of just posting random shit about gross margins and comparing to companies that aren‚Äôt relevant."
03/31/2021,stocks,This is a fundamental misunderstanding of acknowledging WACC and applying an appropriate discount rate to those cash flows. $1 of future cash flow is not always worth $1 of cash flow.

I had about $1,000 in one stock that dropped about 36% over the past week or two, so I decided to cut bait on half of my holdings (highest cost basis shares). What I didn't realize or understand was this thing called a Wash Sale, which increased my cost basis on my remaining shares by about 15% above my previous average cost. 

At this point I don't know what to do. And before I realized the Wash Sale thing I was actually inclined to buy back more of that same stock at the lower price. I suppose I can't do that for at least 30 days now? Do I now hold them for a year?

Edit: Thank you for my first award! Totally unnecessary however I hope this thread helps others like me.

Also based on a comment, I wanted to clarify a few things:
I purchased shares a handful at a time over the course of days/weeks.
I sold roughly half of shares at my highest cost basis, which generally were my FIFO.
The remaining half of shares are basically my more recent buys, and all were made within 30 days of my first half buys. Maybe THAT is what triggered the Wash Sale Rule?"

If something goes down 36%, sell it because you decided the company isn't worth investing in, not just because it went down. Buy low, sell high. Don't sell low! If you'd be willing to buy it again if it went back up, you shouldn't be willing to sell it down. That's just nuts. You should re-assess your whole strategy. If you were going to sell it if it goes down, you should have sold way before 30%. The whole point of selling when it goes down 10% is, what if it goes down 30%?"

If all you did was sell, there is no wash sale here at all. It WILL be a wash sale if you buy back in within 30 days. 

I do not have an explanation for your cost basis, other than if you sell a portion of your holdings, your cost basis will recalculate based on the stock lots left and what you paid for them.

Let's say you're up $500 in realized capital gains across your entire portfolio - including wash sales for stock ABC.  You bought ABC, sold some at a loss, bought some more, and then sold it all for a loss.  But because of gains made on stock XYZ, you're up $500 overall.

03/31/2021,stocks,"Hm not sure what you mean, /u/Kerichokid is correct imo.

> If you buy within either 30 days before or after the loss, wash sale kicks in.

I think this is the main difference we have in our understanding. No one cares about when you bought before the loss, it's only afterwards. Here's my mental model:

Let's say this is the scenario: I buy 100 shares, the price drops 50% immediately, and I sell all of my shares. Here are the possible outcomes:

1. I never touch the stock again. I can deduct the loss on my taxes.
2. I buy back the stock 6 months later. Nothing changes, I can still deduct the loss on my taxes.
3. I buy back the stock the next day. I no longer can deduct the initial loss, but my cost basis is now way higher than it was before. The wash sale rule is applied here, you don't have to worry about it. Your initial loss just won't show up on your broker's tax form as a loss anymore.

An additional experiment: lets say you're at #3, the stock doesn't move, and you decide aw fuck you actually did want to sell. Well your cost basis is high, so when you sell now, it'll show as a loss, even though the stock price didnt change. You can write off this loss on your taxes now, it's just allowing you to artificially realize the loss now instead of before."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Oh, it takes it into account. But any lines with adjustments, like wash sales, have to be entered into the tax form.
You have to subtract the amounts with adjustments from the total, and you can summarize the ones without adjustments on one line, and then you have to enter all the adjustments on another form.
The form the brokers give you (the 1099) doesn't normally break those out separately, but it does tell you the total amount that it adds up to.
I don't mind paying the taxes, but man, the forms are a bear. And if you pay somebody else to do it, they screw it up 25% of the time, so in my opinion that's even worse!"

But again, i would think your Brokerage would give you a breakdown of the short term and long term P&L to use in your tax returns."
03/31/2021,stocks,Yes i'd imagine so. I just didnt find it in my countries laws regarding the subject.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I think what is confusing about this is the fact that the OP bought shares a different times for different prices. When you sell the shares, (I guess), the basis for the remaining shares will depend on whether you specified which of the shares to sell. But I don‚Äôt know is whether if you do not specify, the brokerage will sell the ""First in first out"" shares or the ""Last in first out"". I'm not even sure one CAN specify which you want to sell. That, of course, will determine the basis for the ones sold, and a different one for the remainder shares."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I don't think anything like 1,2,3 happened to OP.

Let's say, they bought 10 shares at $10 each. Sold 5 at $5 each within 30 days. Now the cost basis for remaining 5 would be $15 each. You don't need to buy after a sale to increase the cost basis listed on any share you bought within 30-day before the sell. 

Now OP can hold the rest of the shares until next year, sell them this year. Tax scenarios will play out accordingly. But I think OP is just in the first stage as I mentioned above.

03/31/2021,stocks,He may be in a different country.  You have to be careful copying other people under a different set of tax regulations.
03/31/2021,stocks,"wash sale rule does not affect day traders like you think.

you can buy a stock a million times, and you'll still only be taxed on your **actual** profit."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Hm sorry I'm not sure if I understand-- I'm admittedly slightly confused about exactly how the different lots are calculated, I probably couldn't write out exactly how they're broken down here.

But with regards to FIFO/LIFO etc I think I have a full understanding of that part. If I bought 10 shares of AAPL 2 years ago to hold forever, my gains will be taxed at a lower rate (1 year for LTH). If I decide to daytrade and buy 50 shares with the intent of selling them soon, you're going to want do do any of the daytrading as LIFO-- your last shares will be first out and I assume you'll want this taxed at the higher rate since you're dealing with (presumably) less overall $$.

Basically if you're dealing with large gains, you should try your best to get taxed at the LTH rate. Losses and small gains are (basically) unaffected so LIFO is a good idea if you can convert some shares to long term holdings.

I'm not sure how this has to do with wash sales though? I mean I guess you could try to game it with tax lots but this really seems overly complicated as a long term investor unless you're really big on tax harvesting

EDIT: fml i honestly dont know if i understand anything, this doesnt match my mental model so i think i gotta read lmao https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060313/what-determines-your-cost-basis.asp"

Ummm not gonna lie I think I have to do some major reading on cost basis. Not sure who's right but for sure didnt seem to match up with my previous mental model lol, will letcha know if I figure anything out T_T

EDIT: Ok wait a sec I think I'm back to where I was originally. I guess I just haven't convinced myself that `Now the cost basis for remaining 5 would be $15 each` is true and havent found anything explicit enough in the docs for my tired brain. Cost basis is to record your initial investment. So:

1. You buy 10 shares at $10 each, cost basis for each share is $10.
2. You sell 5 for $5 each, now you have 5 shares worth $5 each
3. Your cost basis for those remaining 5 shares is still $10
4. If you buy 5 additional shares at $5 your avg cost basis will go down (5x $10, 5x $5 = average of $7.5)

Basically idk if selling the 5 shares will affect your cost basis since you bought those all at the same price. Imo cost basis only reflects buy price"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I have a serious mental issue when it comes to taxes so that is not surprising.  How did the guy in the story owe $800k on $45k profit?  This is the way I read the rule, LMK what I'm missing.

Day 1. Buy and sell a stock, make 5$

Day 2. Same stock but lose 5$

Day 3. Make 5$ 

Day 4. Lose $5.

Per article:  The wash-sale rule provides that if an investor wants to sell a security  at a loss, then buy the same or a ‚Äúsubstantially identical‚Äù security  within 30 calendar days either before or after the sale, the wash-sale  rule will kick in and no loss will be claimable for that security on the  current-year tax return.

So would the IRS consider this a $5 gain because the same stock was bought on day 3 after the loss on day 2?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"that guy kept playing the losing stock into 2021, that's why he wasn't allowed to take the loss.

&#x200B;

So he made $1M on MEME in 2020,

then he lost $955k on APES.

but because he kept buying APES in 2021 within the 30 day window, he wasn't allowed to deduct the $955k loss.

so he got stuck with the $1M tax bill.

his $955k loss will have to be settled in the 2021 tax year"
03/31/2021,stocks,"The issue is if you are doing that with multiple stocks and one of them ends up as a loss.  To your wallet, it counts as a loss, but not to the tax man.  So if on the last day stock A went up $5 and stock B went down $4, you will be taxed on $5 gains, even though you only made $1."
2021-03-31 18:57:24,stocks,"UBS upgrades AAPL to 'Buy,' raises price target on iPhone stability & auto opportunity Investment bank UBS has upgraded AAPL to a ""Buy"" and raised its price target to $142, based on a stable iPhone backdrop and the possibility of Apple entering the car market. 

In a note to investors seen by AppleInsider, lead analyst David Vogt says that a ""more stable long-term iPhone demand backdrop with better [average selling prices]"" and Apple's ""likely entry into the auto market"" are driving the UBS revision on AAPL shares. 

The analyst says that, based on analysis, aggregate iPhone demand in 2021 and 2022 should be relatively stable. He doesn't believe there's a ""supercycle"" materializing, but he did raise his 2021 iPhone shipment forecast to 220 million, up from 215 million. Looking ahead to 2022, Vogt also raised his 2022 iPhone shipment estimate to 215 million, up 10 million. He attributes the bump to the ""stickiness of the iPhone ecosystem.""

Apply this to a product like automobile and it‚Äôs an absolute catastrophe waiting to happen."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Apple is already 5+ years too late to enter the market to crush Tesla. There's a reason people have been calling Tesla the Apple of the car industry for years. Tesla literally already does everything unique Apple does with their smartphones, but in the auto market, including:

* Reputation for being great at making a very intuitive UI that's much better then the competition and much easier to use? Check.

* Has their own unique approach to things that goes against the grain? See their self driving methodology. Check.

* Pioneered new innovations in a stale industry that others are now rushing to copy? See over the air software updates, auto-pilot, etc. Check.

* Charges a premium for their product, and has lots of people willing to pay for it? Check.

* Has a rapid fan base that absolutely loves their products and gives them billions of dollars worth of free advertising in social media? Check.

imo Apple is going to fail horribly if they make an EV, because Tesla already offers everything unique Apple could, and already established themselves as the market leader in premium EVs.

As an Apple shareholder I think Apple would be much better off getting their self driving functionality to work and then selling it is to the other automakers imo. Given how most of the legacy automakers have reputations for being absolutely dreadful at writing good software I highly doubt most of them are ever going to get a Level 4 or 5 self driving car to work on their own, so I'm sure they'd be willing to pay Apple a premium to use their self driving software/hardware in their vehicles."

03/31/2021,stocks,"Right, but what that suggests is that the market is extremely optimistic at this point. And we know that, based on all the soaring indices and low interest rates and bailouts. Based on the last 12 years of the stock performance and how investors valued it, the company doubling in size is currently priced into the stock.

The last time AAPL was at this PE ratio was in 2007. From 2007 to 2009 it lost 50% of its share price despite good growth as a company. That's the warning. In an optimistic market, $140 might be a price target. But in a market we've all seen from 2008-2019, the price target is closer to $80.

E.g. sell a put (OPEN position), buy back put (CLOSE position), sell same put (re-OPEN position).

As far as I know, they don't actually manufacturer the chips. And other companies will get priority in chips before Blackberry.

Even with the recent dips, it's already up 100% for the year. That's pretty good for a stock that always misses out on revenue. And since they need chips to be successful during a chip shortage, I think this stock stays flat or even dips further for the year. But to finish 50-100% for the year is still a nice year.

03/31/2021,stocks,"people chase rockets that go BRR. then get anxious when their money is tied up into stock that dips or goes sideways for more than a month. ""oh no, I am missing out"".. 

When I look at my investments, I see one pattermn: whenever I held , I came out on top. not with 150% returns, but I made positive returns on all of them. 

whenever I got anxious and lost my cool, I lost money.   
whenever I chased hype and had FOMO, I lost money. 

I usually do my own DD on whatever I buy. I look at fundamentals and ask the following questions:

1. did their business model work for Y amount of time ? (this should show if they are actually making money )- numbers don¬¥t lie and if the company is in a downward trend, then usually something is wrong. and I am not alking about covid dips or 2008 drops. 
2. do they have upside? meaning new products, patents, partnerships, etc. 
3. will their business model work in future markets ?   
nobody kows the future but my guess is not about plus 50 years. I am 46, so I am looking at  a timeframe of 5-15 years. 

&#x200B;

simply based on these three questions, I would invest in BB, not in NOK. but that¬¥s just me."

They are securing contracts with some of the worlds largest companies and are set to be one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world providing 5G, which has uses way beyond just cell service. They are in a restructuring mode and are going to excel in a few years. 

Nokia isnt just an old phone company, they have adjusted and grown in different industries multiple times before. Originating as a pulp mill, moving to rubber, which led them to cables/electronics, leading them to phones, which has now led them to telecommunications infrastructure.

03/31/2021,stocks,"A lot of analysts suspect the company might be worth up to $45 in the future.  So a lot of newer retail investors were buying in at $15+ expecting that it would skyrocket further.  A lot of analysts said that $14 was a discount for the stock and a lot of people bought in between $12-14 in a second wave.

So now the price is down to probably where it belongs at $10ish and analysts are once again saying 'BUY BUY BUY DISCOUNT.""

A lot of people are getting 'trapped' into a very overpriced stock at various levels entirely based on internet hyping and some terrible advice from WSB type people.  You buy things because you think they'll be worth more later.  You don't buy things for the price that you think it'll be worth some day.  That's just stupid investing.

If people who bought at $25 had sold it at a loss at $24 and then bought again today they would have doubled their Blackberry share count.  Too much of the focus is on short term making vs losing money."

A chip shortage is going to have a bigger impact on the budget products than on the luxury ones.

03/31/2021,stocks,"Because my leaps are ITM and almost two years out so the theta decay is very minimal. My thought process is this:

$3 Calls at a cost basis of $1.50, to break even NOK has to be at a $4.50 stock price in two years, a 12% increase. I believe this is a safe bet, I think it would be difficult to not achieve this.

IF: NOK hits $5/share by call expiration  
THEN: $3 call option would be worth $2 (33% gain when purchased for $1.50)  
AND: Shares purchased at $3.95 would net a 27% gain

IF: NOK hits $6/share by call expiration  
THEN: $3 call option would be worth $3 (100% gain when purchased for $1.50)  
AND: Shares purchased at $3.95 would net a 52% gain

IF: NOK hits $8/share by call expiration  
THEN: $3 call option would be worth $5 (233% gain when purchased for $1.50)  
AND: Shares purchased at $3.95 would net a 103% gain

&#x200B;

**Basically, I am so confident that this will go up in price in 2 years that I am willing to take a bit of extra risk for the greater upside of calls**

&#x200B;

If you're interested in math, this equations tells me at exactly what price it pays off to buy LEAPS instead of shares:

x/3.95 = (x-3)/1.5       where x = share price

this solves to x = 4.84

So if NOK reaches $4.84 by Jan. 2023 then it is worthwhile to buy LEAPS"
03/31/2021,stocks,"The other side of ""I'll just sell calls"" - when you can't even get $1 premium for going up $0.5 because the shares are so diluted that the options chain doesn't even allow for side ways trading and so implied volatility is <30%."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I disagree, many of these announcements are recent, lots of news as of late and the price hardly moved upon announcement. And institutional ownership in Nokia is very low. I believe eventually more institutions will start buying this stock when they see its potential, which will drive the price higher as large purchases are made. 

Nokia has only traded below $4 for about a year (in 2013) since 1997. In 25 years, only one year did it have a valuation this low. Everyone thats saying its trading sideways, maybe in comparison to its $40-60 peaks but its not been totally sideways. Look at the runup leading into 2014 where it almost doubled in price. 

NOK doesnt need to go to $40 for it to make you a good profit, I think $40 is very unlikely, but possible in a long time frame. I think realistically $5-12 in the next few years, which will still net a great return for me."

In this case, before the improvement, if 1000w of light fell on a panel, the panel would output 100w.  After the improvement, it would output 180w.

If I'm looking to open a position in a (mostly) stable stock like AAPL, which I don't believe will go up more than a few dollars from it's current price $123, why wouldn't I sell a put deep ITM like strike 190 @67.  The premium I receive ($6,700) would far exceed any short-term losses from the stock price.  What risks am I missing?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"assuming it wont go over 190, selling the 190p for 67 means:

1. you need to have 190x100=19000 liquid to cover it
2. you will be assigned the shares for a total cost of 19000-6700=12300

so you just bought 100 shares for 123 the long way"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Nothing, selling a deep ITM put is similar to buying the shares, but you are short volatility."
03/31/2021,stocks,"> why wouldn't I sell a put deep ITM like strike 190 @67

You can certainly do this. However, you would probably would be waiting, and sitting on 19k in cash, until close to expiration when the stock will (probably) be assigned to you.  

If the stock moves against you, you'll still be paying 190 dollars a share. If the stock moves in your direction, and the option price falls, you'd be able to buy to close the position and keep the remaining premium. 

The risk is that you'll be sitting on 19,000 dollars in cash that could be doing something else while you wait for the contract to get close to expiry and the stock to be assigned to or for it to be profitable for you to buy back your option and close the position.

> The premium I receive ($6,700) would far exceed any short-term losses

This isn't correct. The intrinsic value of the contract you would sell is about 67 dollars. The extrinsic value of the contract is effectively 0 (no one expects apple to trade at 190). The share price is about 123. You'll collect the 6700 when you sell the option, but you are still obligated to buy the shares at 190. If the shares fall to 120, you are still out 3 dollars a share even considering the premium you received for the contract. If the shares fall more, you lose more. 

A more common way to make this trade would be to sell something closer to the money. Selling a put at 120 at 51 DTE, nets you 430 in premium. If it is assigned, great, you wanted to shares anyway, if not then you made ~3.75% on your 12k in 51 days. Selling at 125 makes it more like that you will be assigned, and you'd collect 6.75 in premium for your trouble."
03/31/2021,stocks,Because the current price ($123) is above the strike price.
03/31/2021,stocks,A useful title.
03/31/2021,stocks,cause no one would buy your put
03/31/2021,stocks,"True, which is why I used AAPL for its low volatility as the example.  Thanks."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Agreed.  A farther out expiration would be a safer play, but I was looking at it from the perspective of maximizing profit in the shortest amount of time selling puts.  I just realized I forgot to the include the DTE, which would be < 7."
03/31/2021,stocks,Why does the 19000 have to sit unused?
03/31/2021,stocks,I may have written it wrong.  The strike price is 190.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I do realize this too, the assumption was that if there'd be someone crazy enough to buy it.  Just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything else"
03/31/2021,stocks,"> A farther out expiration would be a safer play

Further out, you are taking more risk, but that risk is basically the same as buying the shares outright.

> maximizing profit in the shortest amount of time selling puts

If you want to buy the shares anyway, selling ATM or slightly OTM is probably a better move because those contracts have extrinsic value. As an option seller, in general, you want to be selling extrinsic value and hoping that value moves towards 0 at the DTE approaches."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I'm not following (as someone who sells a lot of puts).  What is the benefit to you?

You are promising to pay 190 for it and being paid 67, the difference being the current price? Unless you are trying to exploit the 67 in the meantime with some margin trickery it just sounds like buying it with extra steps.

The 67 doesn't protect against losses because you owe it back on the short put when you get assigned. You have to pay the 67 plus whatever losses to buy it at the 190 you promised."
03/31/2021,stocks,"When selling a put option you have 2 choices: cash secured or margin secured.

If selling margin secured puts, in general, you don't have to pay interest on the position, but you do have to be ready to either pony up the cash to buy the stock or be willing to pay interest after buying the stock on margin.

Selling cash secured puts, I think, is more common. When you sell a cash secured put, your broker will segregate the funds needed to secure the contract, and you'll be unable to use those funds for trading until the position is closed."
03/31/2021,stocks,I'm an idiot.  I had incorrectly assumed that I'd get to keep the premium even if the stock closes below the strike price.  lol wouldn't that be nice.
03/31/2021,stocks,"But the cash could buy a marginable stock and not sit unused. It would require having authorization to trade naked options, so many people couldn't do it. But many people could."
03/31/2021,stocks,"> incorrectly assumed that I'd get to keep the premium even if the stock closes below

No, this is correct. You get to keep the premium no matter what.

The issue is that the delta of this 190 strike option is 1, so by selling this contract, you have effectively bought the shares at the current price."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yes, you could. Not sure how common this is, but it is out of my risk tolerance for sure.

If the security you bought goes down, and the underlying on the option you sold goes down, you've turned 1 losing trade into 2 losing trades."
03/31/2021,stocks,you're right.  that's the part that slipped my mind.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Wait, but that would mean I get the $6,700 with the stock at the current price, right?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Welcome to options.

I traded an nVidia call yesterday when it looked like semis were firming. It immediately turned against me and I basically gave up, but I put in a sell order at a reasonable profit level and let it ride.

Today without warning NVDA popped and I got a text. Sweet, I made my target. Then I checked and saw how far NVDA had popped. I had left about 2X more profit on the table.

Can't win for winning."
03/31/2021,stocks,"No.

If you sell the contract, you get the 6700 dollars no matter what. It is yours. However, you still have to buy the shares at 190. You bought the shares for 190, but your cost basis is the current price because of the premium you received for the contract.

You don't get to sell the contract for 6700 and buy the shares for the current price. But, effectively, by selling a contract this far ITM, you have bought the shares at the current price.

You can measure this with the delta of the option. Delta measures the effect of the underlying moving 1 dollar on the price of the option. 

As an example, the delta on AAPL210416P190 is -1. This means that if AAPL goes 1 dollar higher, that contract will be worth 1 dollar less (and you could buy it back cheaper than you sold it for!). In general, the further ITM a put option is the closer the delta will be to -1. A delta of -1 (or 1) means the contract will move 1:1 with the price pf the underlying."

03/31/2021,stocks,"Also, note, however, that, if by some miracle, AAPL closes above 190 by 4/16, you'll pocket 6700 and have no obligation to buy the shares because the contract is now OTM."

Heartland Express:

>Heartland Express is one of the leading trucking companies in the short-to-medium haul truckload market in the U.S. The company has seen its revenue expand in 2020, primarily due to the impact of the Millis Transfer acquisition in August 2019. The company expects driver shortages to continue in 2021, adversely impacting its overall costs. In fact, Heartland‚Äôs operating ratio is much higher at 85.5% compared to 69.3% for Norfolk Southern.

2021-03-31 17:35:15,stocks,"TD Ameritrade or Fidelity? I know this has been discussed a lot already, but I would like to hear from people on Just these two brokers. I am using Robinhood and I really like it, but with all the hate directed at them for the way they do business. I can't decide between TD Ameritrade and Fidelity and have opened accounts at both, now I am trying to decide which one to fund or if I should use Fidelity for my long positions and TD for my active trading. I read that TD uses PFOF, which seems to be a negative, but it looks simpler to use. Fidelity seems solid as a rock, but even Active Trader Pro is confusing to me. I really like the simplicity of Robinhood, but the concerns with it have convinced me to switch."
03/31/2021,stocks,Both are good but prefer fidelity. Fraction shares is a great feature. TD has high fees for mutual funds and fidelity has a lot of low cost options.
03/31/2021,stocks,Fidelity
03/31/2021,stocks,Fidelity and just stick to buying shares it is quite simple if you do that and dont worry about anything else.
03/31/2021,stocks,"It isn't hate over Robinhood. They just steal your money. You dont have to hate them to recognize that much. You can loooooooove their display and format, and still not let them steal your money."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I use TD Ameritrade strictly because of ThinkorSwim. Fidelity is also a great choice and comparable in almost every regard, I just don't like their trading software"
03/31/2021,stocks,Fidelity
03/31/2021,stocks,"I have stuff in fidelity, RH, and webull. Just opened TD. 

RH ease of use

Fidelity- 0 trade fees (less its foreign stock). I also like the multiple accounts. My free cash sits in a money market while it sits. Roth IRA incorporated is a plus. Fractional shares are awesome. 

Webull- nice format. Simple to use. Too many adds and promos for me. Don't care for the layout much. 

TD-- Think or swim is awesome. Takes a little to learn and get used to. Allows for paper trading. No negatives yet."
03/31/2021,stocks,Fidelity all the way. I'm still discovering additional analysis tools on their site.
03/31/2021,stocks,TDA for their thinkorswim
03/31/2021,stocks,Anything except for Robinhood.
03/31/2021,stocks,Schwab
03/31/2021,stocks,TDA
03/31/2021,stocks,Fidelity for long positions and TD for active trading
03/31/2021,stocks,Fidelity seems to have higher fees on OTC and foreign stocks.
03/31/2021,stocks,Fidelity. Transferred my TD assets there several weeks ago.
03/31/2021,stocks,I have both TDA and Fidelity. Personally I prefer TDA but Fidelity is launching a new app soon and if it‚Äôs functional I may switch to them.
03/31/2021,stocks,TDA is owned by Schwab and in the next few year all accounts with be moved over to the Schwab system.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I switched from RH to Fidelity in January, and I really like it. Took a little getting used to the mobile app - RH's clean and simple interface is nice, but limited on info compared to Fidelity.

The transfer was also pretty quick and easy."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôve used both, and prefer Fidelity.

With that said, both have customer support. I only have two gripes with TDA.

1) harder to see individual cost basis of lots
2) you can‚Äôt purchase fractional shares, like you can with Fidelity"
03/31/2021,stocks,Both
03/31/2021,stocks,I like TD OTC fee is 6.95 vs $50 in Fidelity
03/31/2021,stocks,"TD Ameritrade stopped buy orders in January, when Apex Clearing was having issues.

Fidelity does their own clearing.

Vanguard is another big broker.  I am not sure, if they had issues with clearing trades."
03/31/2021,stocks,Etrade
03/31/2021,stocks,TD
03/31/2021,stocks,"I have a question about a newer Fidelity account.  Money is cleared and have purchased several stocks/funds.  When I recently deposited money it has been sitting in Fidelity‚Äôs SPAXX govt mm fund.  I know this is the core account and it transfers from there when I make more purchases.  BUT after several days, when I go to make a trade it tells me I have no settled cash to buy with, even though it shows I have enough buying power.  I hate this.  Is there a way to switch the base account to cash, and is there any negatives to doing that?  Helpful hints wanted, thank you."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Fungible. And both need major overhauls to their trading platforms. TD has at least three, and all are old."
03/31/2021,stocks,"if you want simplicity like RH, then stick to active trader pro. even if its confusing you now, stick with it and learn how to use the platform. i feel like ThinkorSwim is definitely a little bit more complex than active trader even though thats the one i like to use"
03/31/2021,stocks,"RH was my first trading platform, switched to Fidelity after the first GME rush died down.

I was pleasantly surprised with all the in-house/in-app research available, and Active Trader Pro was the final nail in getting me to switch to predominately using the desktop for trading- having more info available at the same time without switching windows is way better than having a simpler interface, imo.  What I didnt consider was how much more I like using their website afterhours, as opposed to the app, for research on companies and sectors, a nice feed of applicable SEC filings, and setting my price alerts and limit orders.  The mobile app is pretty cumbersome, but works well for casually browsing news headlines associated with your portfolio and watchlists, better so than RH gives. Access to the OTC markets is another big plus I didnt know I wanted coming from RH, and being their own clearing house was a big factor for me at the time, though it doesnt really help when the retail market in general is limited in trades driving the share price down, but hopefully that scenario will remain uncommon.

I kept my RH account for stocks that I dont buy/sell as much, as a way to 'stick it to 'em' by having hardly any trade data from my account to sell to shitadel, as meaningless as that may be, it makes me feel good inside, I'll wait until they go public to actually deactivate it, out of spite lol"
03/31/2021,stocks,I don't like the founders of TD Ameritrade
03/31/2021,stocks,TD purely because the ThinkorSwim platform is wonderful.
03/31/2021,stocks,I just got fidelity for the no fee penny stock trading
03/31/2021,stocks,TD Ameritrade has a better trading platform
03/31/2021,stocks,"I use Fidelity and find it user friendly. 

Whichever you choose will still be a better option than Robin-da-hood."
03/31/2021,stocks,TD Ameritrade
03/31/2021,stocks,"i just don't understand the appeal to TDA (as opposed to just signing up for schwab) when schwab bought out TDA and is in the process of merging them in.

TDA is basically signing up for schwab with extra steps (and when i last looked, worse sign up bonuses though that  could have changed)"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Primary answer - I have both, probably Fidelity even though it's dated. Better research partners, better fills, better customer service, worse ui. 

Secondary answer - A basic ui is only necessary when you are new and learning, which is true for anything really. You will get used anything new over time. If you truly want a Robinhood like experience with no PFOF, Public is the way to go, but it has drawbacks too (no options). 

Lastly, even though you specifically asked for those two, Schwab and Merrill edge are more enjoyable to use than Fidelity or TDa. Schwab now owns TDa anyways. Only thing that prevents me from using Merrill entirely though is they don't allow ARK holdings which have been a significant portion of my portfolio for a couple years now."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I am not happy with TD customer service. They avoid answering direct questions when it doesn't suit them.

Also, they are Paid for order flow from citadel. . .

I am leaving TD once the GME volitility ends"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Lots of great advice on here! One more question I forgot to ask is whether TD and Fidelity let you use the proceeds from selling a stock right away like Robinhood does, or is there a waiting period?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I like fractional shares, how much are their options fees?"
03/31/2021,stocks,I use both. Fidelity is all around better with much better decision tools and charting capabilities. The only advantage for TD is extended trading hours.
03/31/2021,stocks,Thank you. I did not know that TD did not do fractional shares. That is a big plus for Fidelity imo.
03/31/2021,stocks,That is all I am doing for now.
03/31/2021,stocks,I have a free share that I keep in Robinhood and use their ticker bc it‚Äôs a quick and easy check Vs Fidelity.
03/31/2021,stocks,"That is why I am switching. I hate to do it but I am not going to let them rip me off. Plus the concern over whether I even own the shares I am buying. I have never short sold, but I think I would do it with them when they have their initial IPO. Seems like a stupid time for them to do that, guess the owners want that big IPO money. Greedy!"
03/31/2021,stocks,This. Schwab is fantastic.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Sheesh I was hoping someone was going to say this, TD and Schwab are merging soon right? I was gonna go with TD until I heard about that and decided to just go with Schwab since TD is going to them."
03/31/2021,stocks,That is where I am leaning right now.
03/31/2021,stocks,This is quite important.
03/31/2021,stocks,Fidelity does not charge any OTC fees. That's pretty much entirely what I use Fidelity for. OTC and reverse split arbitrage round ups.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Sounds more and more like it might be best to use both and invest differently in each one. Just hate to have to keep track of two different brokers, but it sounds like it is worth it."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I don't know how to do this from the mobile app. If you log into the web UI though,

1. Go to the ""Positions"" tab.

2. Click on the Cash / SPAXX position. It should expand to show you the position details.

3. In that details section there'll be a green ""Change core position"" button. Hit that. 

The advantage to SPAXX is that any cash you have sitting around will generate a little bit of interest. The downside is it's like 0.06% right now, and if you don't have margin enabled on your account it is simpler to leave the core position as cash."
03/31/2021,stocks,Haven't really checked them out. I will take a look. Thanks!
03/31/2021,stocks,That is why I am still on Robinhood but opening accounts elsewhere so I can completely switch when that roller coaster comes to an end. I don't want to sell GME and I REALLY don't want it tied up while I transfer.
03/31/2021,stocks,I believe it's $0.65 per option
03/31/2021,stocks,.65 per. Also if you have high enough credit they have a 2 percent back card and deposits rewards into brokerage. I Use the rewards to put into fractional shares or a mutual fund. Cool little option that's availible
03/31/2021,stocks,"I do not do options yet because I want to thoroughly understand them before I try. I saw a post where a guy lost like $200K by jumping into options right away. I do want to do them in the future though, so that is something to consider."
03/31/2021,stocks,Fidelity also has extended trading hours. You just have to enable it.
03/31/2021,stocks,Same. In RH I have a list of all the stocks I have in Fidelity and just use the app to see how they are doing for the day.
03/31/2021,stocks,They stole from the long share owners. not the shorts.
03/31/2021,stocks,I believe they are creating a new platform that merges the best of each and td isn't transferring directly to schwab.. At least that's what their media release said.
03/31/2021,stocks,"They charge $50 for each trade in foreign OTC that isn't DTC eligible.  What exactly that means in terms of which ones you can trade without the fee, I don't know.  I know I have bought OTC shares without the $50 fee, but I've heard from plenty of others that were hit with the fee."
03/31/2021,stocks,I know what OTC means. No idea what the other is. I have some learning to do.
03/31/2021,stocks,Great info thank you...I‚Äôll try this
03/31/2021,stocks,"And if you play theta gang, you only pay fees when you open the position. Buy-to-close is commission free (well, below a certain price point that I don't remember)."
03/31/2021,stocks,Thank you
03/31/2021,stocks,Thank you
03/31/2021,stocks,"Interesting, so accounts on both services would actually transfer to a entirely new service that take the benefits of both? I‚Äôm just hoping it won‚Äôt be a mess. Part of the reason I went straight to Schwab hoping my account wouldn‚Äôt change at all. Just stuff got added or slight changes. It just seems like merging two huge financial companies wouldn‚Äôt be the easiest thing in the world."
03/31/2021,stocks,Interesting. Thanks for the heads up.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Sometimes when companies do reverse splits they offer to round up left over shares. You can find their intentions pre split in the filing documents. So let's say a company is doing a 1:50 reverse so for every 50 shares you owned you now own 1 share and the value of that one share scales to what 50 shares used to be worth (in theory). Well if the agreement has a round up clause then 1 share will round up to 1 share the same as 50 which would equal a 50x gain overnight. Unfortunately, if you pay attention to that math you will realize it doesn't scale. So the profit per transaction is anywhere from $2 - $100 with $100 being rare, but you can duplicate it across multiple brokerages. 

You'll never score big but it's great supplemental income with very little risk. YTD gains so far this year are a few hundred including a really weird one processing right now that may net $200 per account.  The risk being that they change the agreement right before split or your brokerage pays cash in lieu instead of honoring the round up."
03/31/2021,stocks,I am guessing something like that. Schwab will obviously have control of the merge so I am guessing final product will resemble schwab after merge. I bet the transfer will be seamless for schwab members with just a big upgrade to the same app/website overnight but td not as seamless
03/31/2021,stocks,"they do give you an alert about the fee if its going to be incurred with Fidelity, ex would be EENNF right now."
03/31/2021,stocks,Thanks for the info!
03/31/2021,stocks,"Okay, good to hear. Thanks"
2021-03-31 17:10:58,stocks,"How necessary are short sellers? As the title says, I'm just looking for opinions on the necessity of short sellers in the stock market, and whether their uses could be found elsewhere. 

The concept seems unhealthy, but believing in at least a mostly regulation free market, I can see how they would, at least in a sense, act as the ""police,"" of the marketplace, picking out fraud or totally incorrect business models. Having said that, is there not a better model to remove ""parasites,"" or failing business models?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Potentially you are conflating short selling with market manipulation. It's only a problem when a false narrative gets created solely to tank a stock in the interest of those that hold a short position. 

On it's own short selling adds liquidity to the market and cushions large drops since short sellers will buy to close their short positions."
03/31/2021,stocks,The concept is not any more unhealthy than going long. If fact all of the financial crisis have happend because wall street was way to long and to greedy. Short selling happens far less on wall street than you think. Going long is easier less risky and more profitable than going short so most firms ibanks and pension funds and yes even hedge funds go long 90% of the time. What retail need to look out for far more than short selling is the bullshit price targets investment banks put out.
03/31/2021,stocks,"""Short sellers"" aren't really a thing. L/S equity hedge funds are, so they can create synthetic risk exposure via a combination of long/short positions that aren't available with single-security investment vehicles.

I think the question you're getting at is ""why are people allowed to short stocks. This seems risky and more like gambling than investing"" which is a common comment on the investing and finance subs.

That question usually comes from posters who's exposure to finance and investing has only been through reddit, which unsurprisingly, treats derivatives as a means to create artificial leverage and max out returns rather than **what they were actually created / intended for** - which is to ***hedge away risk and protect your capital*** albeit at a premium.

TLDR: Shorting a security is intended to protect the owner of the security from losses / lock in to his or her gains. Most redditors treat them as a gambling instrument because, ya know, everyone else on the internet is doing it?"
03/31/2021,stocks,There's nothing wrong with short selling. What's wrong is NAKED short selling where the short seller is not in possession of the stock he is selling short.
03/31/2021,stocks,Magic money when stocks go up has to come from somewhere
03/31/2021,stocks,"If a stock has low liquidity and you want to buy shares, you might need a short seller willing to take the other side.  The short seller doing so could be seen as improving the liquidity of a stock since you dont have to wait around for someone with shares to sell."
03/31/2021,stocks,"The general thinking about the economic role of the market is that it performs the function of price discovery. It can only perform that function if, in the long term, the market price of any asset tends to the intrinsic value of that asset as determined by economic usefulness (which in financial valuation models we try to approximate by computing a so-called ""fair price"").

From this perspective, the main function of short sellers is that they try to identify overvaluation and work to correct it (for a profit to themselves), just as value investors try to identify undervaluation and invest (which works to correct it) for a profit to themselves. Both kinds of players ultimately contribute to the market price converging toward intrinsic value and hence to price discovery. Short sellers also play a crucial role in discovering unethical behavior by companies, which helps market integrity.

Problems arise only when short sellers are dishonest (spreading unjustified FUD to tank the price for personal profit), which is similar to longs being dishonest (spreading unjustified optimism in order to pump the price for personal profit). By and large pumping by longs is a lot more common on Wall Street and in the media than FUD attacks by shorts."
03/31/2021,stocks,Making money when stocks go down is unhealthy?
03/31/2021,stocks,"The only necessary short sellers, IMO, are whistleblower ones, the ones calling out fraud.

The rest?  Who cares if stocks have higher highs and lower lows!

(Read: I don't consider the liquidity argument justified.)"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Short sellers help keep index fund fees low, therefore I like them. Index funds make a good amount of money lending out shares to short sellers, which means they don't have to charge as much to the fund owners."
03/31/2021,stocks,"The argument that short sells help regulate the market by finding fake companies and shorting them is basically admiring the sec is useless and can't do their job. Short sellers add no value to anything in this world, literally."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Imagine your stock, for whatever the reason, starts to tank. Apparently, the accountant has left the country with his suitcases full of money and a fake passport, the CEO uses racial slurs on twitter and its main factory burns to the ground, all in the same day. 

Who the hell is going to buy your shares that are dropping in price by the minute in that situation, besides maybe an uniformed idiot? Yep, a short seller that is covering his positions for profit."
03/31/2021,stocks,The fact that you call them parasites shows your gross misunderstanding about how the market works.
03/31/2021,stocks,"theyre 100% necessary and theyre incredibly good for the market

take tsla: half of the reason theyre so high up is because of short sellers. they kept expecting tsla to fall to 0 but because tsla kept outperforming, theyve been forced to cover, forcing tsla higher up for years"
03/31/2021,stocks,Like one kidney
03/31/2021,stocks,"Its only unhealthy for speculators. You can't short something which actually has intrinsic value. Well, you can, but people will happily buy it at a discount. Healthy companies that have real assets, real profits, pay dividends, it doesn't matter what their stock price is. If they get shorted, people buy for the good yield and book value. Its only speculative companies, whose stock itself is their primary product / brand, that are hurt by short sellers. And that's good because it keeps market values fair, and prevents bubbles from forming. But of course shorting is offset by massive leverage in the reverse direction. In aggregate long leverage is much higher than short, because in the long term the currency is going to inflate, so there is a natural advantage to being long which incentivizes leverage and causes boom / bust cycles."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Short Sellers are actually good. They make markets more capital efficient. For example, they could short a company that's not producing a lot of output or is going bankrupt and use that capital to allocate on companies that are actually producing ""more value"" to the economy. But yeah , some of them are toxic and destructive short sellers like FUDding the media and naked shorting."
03/31/2021,stocks,About as necessary as yellowjackets imo
03/31/2021,stocks,It just needs to be regulated with caps.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Market efficiency. To be honest short selling is the best way to bring a hyped market to reality. 
Say that you bought a stock at x20 times it‚Äôs fair value thinking that x20 is a good investment (as an example Tesla at 2000 dollars instead of 600). Than people started selling and the stock price dropped to 400. you‚Äôd be in a shitty situation. 
Basically what the shorts look for is inefficiency. And in ideal circumstances they stabilise the prices and the market"
03/31/2021,stocks,About as much as the banana peel on the sidewalk
03/31/2021,stocks,And market manipulation isn‚Äôt when a short seller lays out their thesis on why they are short selling a stock ‚Äî unless they are lying.
03/31/2021,stocks,I love it when a swarm of new higher price targets and SA articles come out in an attempt to pump up garbage.
03/31/2021,stocks,He‚Äôs a noob with diamond üíé hands
03/31/2021,stocks,"I didnt call short sellers parasites. I was referring to fake business trying to parasite off the stock market. Short sellers would prevent this by tanking their business. Of course, there are a lot of assumptions and lack of nuance around reddit, so no hard feelings."
03/31/2021,stocks,It‚Äôs more a ‚Äúhow‚Äù than a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù
03/31/2021,stocks,"Just before nio drop Morgan Stanley increased their price target, I knew the stock was going to plummet at this moment"
03/31/2021,stocks,Grunt like an ape and yell to the mooooooon!!!!!
2021-03-31 17:07:17,stocks,"Company's Secondary Offering ‚Äî how to react? Not too long ago I tossed about 300$ into a speculative pharma company. I liked the drug technology they were developing and I was looking to hold the stock for quite some time. I even rode past all time highs of 40% profit. My plan was to hold until they would reach later stages of FDA approval, or better yet they actually get approved. It is money I am ready to lose and a bit of gambling makes the stock market more fun.

Yesterday after hours, the firm announced a secondary offering of shares. The market obviously reacted poorly and since then the stock has dropped 25%. I don't have access to after hours so there was no way I could consider selling out temporarily or even permanently. I've generally had two different investing strategies: buy & forget, or momentum. This was a buy & forget. However, I've never had to deal with dilution with any of my previous investments so now I feel a bit like a fish out of water. A second offering is essentially a debt issue, but how bad of a bearish signal is it? Should I just jump ship and get out while I still can, or should I stick to being a bagholder as I intended.

I don't have too much experience with investing in individual stocks, so maybe someone can walk me through a good course of action.

EDIT: For those curious, it is NMTR. They develop orphan drugs for gastrological disorders. I became interested in them because a friend of mine is a gastrologist and he occasionally talks about his work and the related diseases."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Biotechs often need to do these to fund phase 3s. It's certainly not bullish but also not necessarily bearish, under the assumption that you're holding for home run potential. 

I don't like secondaries in anything besides biotechs, just kinda comes with the territory on them usually."
03/31/2021,stocks,It depends on what they were raising money for and if you think it is a sign of ongoing problems or not.  The stock is going to drop just because of the dilution itself but now that it has dropped you just need to figure out if the company is still worth the new price.  Was the dilution completely factored in the drop or not?  Was the need to raise money a bad long term sign or not?

03/31/2021,stocks,Thank you for the answer. These questions really help in evaluating the situation. Time to dig into the company's financials and find whatever news I can on their FDA trials ‚Äî likely why the money was needed.

Averaging down is a term described for buying more of a stock that you are already red in. If your buying a stock that's on its way up then that's generally referred to as just buying. 

Averaging down is more of a strategy aimed at lowering your breakeven price. Aka; how far back up it has to move % for you to be out of the red. If your example was the opposite way around, and you bought at 600, it drops to 400 you buy again, now your average is 500. So the SP only needs a 25% move for you to breakeven instead of a 50%. The catch is the added risk of it continuing to go down and you having put more money in. 

Whereas in your example you are in the green even after buying 1 share at 600, because the price would have to drop to 400 before your in the red."

Similarly, if you bought each lot of 10 on different dates, they'll become long-term holdings on different dates, which also has tax implications.

So looking at your average cost basis can be good enough for many situations, but it can easily get you in trouble.

Additionally, deciding to make a buying decision based on ""averaging down"" can easily lead to purely fallacious reasoning, such as when many people suggest that if you've got 10@$20 and the current price is $10, that you should buy more shares in order to ""drag down your average cost basis"", thinking that somehow this ""makes it easier"" to profit on your position.

Cost average is a useful *summation*, but also a highly abused one that people treat as a **goal**. Green Vs.

No one made the claim that adding a larger amount of $ reduces risk. It just reduces your average price per share. This debate was surrounding the claim that averaging down isn‚Äôt real.

yes, if you buy for $100 and averaged down enough at $10 to where you‚Äôre in the green at $20, yeah you‚Äôre still at an $80 loss on the first share..which is why your average is slightly higher than the level where you were able to buy again at.. the idea is the gains from the second set of buys offset the losses from the first. That‚Äôs the point, that‚Äôs how averages work, no one thinks the $100 share is suddenly worth $10, otherwise your average wouldn‚Äôt be $19 after buying for $10 lol.

Sure it can, no one said averaging down eliminates risk? it just reduces the amount of % a stock needs to go up for you to be in the green again.

Mathematics are not a fallacy. Averages are literally just a mathematical formula man, don‚Äôt know how much more I can stress this. Can you use sunk cost fallacy as justification to average down? Sure, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the mathematical reasons behind averaging down are invalid, delusional, or dumb. Sometimes it‚Äôs a very viable and smart strategy. Sometimes you have a good company dragged down by external temporary factors. If you use that as an opportunity to average down not only will you be in the green sooner but you‚Äôll also make more money in the long run having more shares. Sure if you buy more stock in a bad company it can still go down more. It all depends on the stock and the market conditions.

If you look at it in the other direction the stock market actually discounts the price of a company by about a third, because that's the level at which people are willing to take on the basket of risks in hopes of getting a reward when somebody does take over the company."

03/31/2021,stocks,"If the company IPOs with 10million shares, when you buy or sell a share on the secondary market, you are just moving some of those 10mil around.

Or in a secondary offering they might sell 1m new shares on the open market, leaving 11mil total.

The total number of shares available is called the ""float"", and the company uniquely has the ability to change the float."
2021-03-31 14:34:59,stocks,"How can a stock go down significantly when it has far higher inflows that outflows in a day? Theres quite a bit I don't understand here about how stocks are valued. I can't figure out how to post a picture of the diagrams and whatnot so I'll just describe it. 

Basically it's regarding an ETF with inflows of $.82mil and outflows of $.33mil today. It was down 1.58% on the day. All my info is from Webull, but the day's chart only had 3 periods at the bottom (whatever they're called) that were red, with all of the others being green. 

Now I know it'd be pretty easy to tell me to just learn more about what I'm talking about, but not knowing all of the terms for things and the jargon for describing financial data has not hindered my ability to get a decent return over the past few years. I try to avoid meme stocks and anything overly volatile. 

Anyway, I was unclear about the sub rules as well so the ETF in question is $DBB and I do not currently have any positions in it. I just want to know how it's possible that the inflows can be so much higher than the outflows and the stock can still go down. Any explanation would be really appreciated. Thank you guys"
03/31/2021,stocks,The basket of stocks the etc buys is what determines the price fluctuation of the etf. Not inflows or out flows of the wtf itself.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Well I checked another source, and it said that on the day the ETFs inflows were .91mil with outflows of .50mil"
03/31/2021,stocks,"In this case, the stocks the ETF held went down. But in addition to that, prices aren't determined entirely by how much is bought or sold."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Okay that makes a lot more sense. So basically, the assets owned by the etf went down in value today but investors expect that they will be increasing in the future?"

03/31/2021,stocks,"Yeah it‚Äôs 67% bonds it looks like, so it‚Äôs gonna be heavily influenced by those fluctuations instead of in/out flows. Depending on their charter, they will purchase/sell allocations to keep the balance written in the charter. Charters can vary a lot. Maybe it‚Äôs daily, maybe weekly, maybe whenever they feel like it. It could be they can fluctuate holdings within a small range: Like 60-80% but it just so happens to be 67 right now...there is a lot that ETFs can do."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Perhaps. There are plenty of reasons why people will buy into an ETF, particularly on a red day.

Just imagine an ETF as one giant pot of money, that then gets invested into a basket of stocks. It copies the movement of the stocks it is invested in. You don‚Äôt invest into the ETF as a stock, it behaves differently."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I think everyone who buys long wants the underlying stock to go up. Including etf buyers. Each etf has a buying objective. They typically buy sectors. For example the ‚Äújets‚Äù etf buys airlines. Etf buyers typically only represent a very small portion of buyers or sellers of the underlying equities. Same example, jets 10 day average volume is around 7.5m. Jet blue alone has a 10 day average volume of almost 10m"

They are an eyesore though, and sometimes that‚Äôs on purpose to conceal what they might be. If you really want to know exactly what bonds they are buying that‚Äôs where you find em. From there you would have to look at what the bonds are for and decide whether or not it‚Äôs something you like. It goes pretty deep.

2. The UK is set to have a 3rd wave, the spin by the media is already in action, sayings it's an EU wave, the reality is the EU 3rd wave was caused by the UK variant of covid.
3. 52% of the population are not fully vaccinated, only the first jab has been administered, only 5% of the UK has been fully vaccinated."
03/31/2021,stocks,"They're slowing down their vaccination process tremendously for the coming month, suggesting massive supply issues.

&#x200B;

They could likely postpone further openings. Given that their new daily infections aren't going down anymore for a while and they loosened restrictions a few days ago, infections will naturally go up. They made the bold statement that as soon as restrictions go away, they will stay away. If numbers go up, chances are, they're not gonna take the risk and open more just yet. 

&#x200B;

The political narrative suggests they're playing with the thought of pulling off New Zealand or Australia entry restrictions, as they're so far ahead in the vaccination process and shit scared of a new mutation.

Also, AZ is taking massive hits in reputation.

&#x200B;

Then there's Brexit. Several industries already went belly up with losses in exports to the EU reaching from 45 - 98%.  
Meanwhile, the financial sector is leaving for the EU in big chunks. And so are skilled immigrants.  


Meanwhile, rent is still going up, nobody can afford to live in the UK anymore and at the same time, unemployment is skyrocketing.

The EU is having a third wave and part of it is down to the B1.1.7 variant from the UK, but the UK has had that variant around for much longer and has not seen the third spike, so you can't say the variant is the only reason. The EUs response to the rise in infections in February wasn't proactive enough and led to this third wave. The first jab has been found to provide 80% protection from hospitalization and 85% from death, so the impacts of any rise in infections should be somewhat limited. (Also, that 5% figure will be 25% or so by the end of April due to the UK's vaccine rollout being by far the fastest and most successful in western Europe).

It is, the UK government has already been putting spin on it by talking about not being able to do anything about a 3rd wave washing up on their shores from the EU. What are you basing your claim on?

>52% of UK population have had first vaccine, compared to EU average of 11%

and the 12 week period is almost up, without a second vaccination the first shots are going to diminish effectiveness, the UK is facing a shortage of vaccines as they were importing many from the EU and the raw materials to manufacture them are being cut off by India. They won't be able to give second shots to most during the save window to do so.

&#x200B;

>54.7% of UK have antibodies (herd immunity)

The antibodies will be gone, they don't last without a second shot, there won't be any largescale herd immunity, the UK will face a 3rd wave, another lockdown and also risks creating vaccine-resistant variants as a result.

&#x200B;

I don't think you understand how utterly stupid the UK government actually is, they are treating the entire pandemic as a money-making/tabloid spin/vote-winning campaign. Half of the vaccines UK citizens have received were from the EU and exported to the UK, that's now ending, The Government is dragging the country into a ditch and them claiming to have saved them from said ditch.

Not a smart investment, wait for everything to crash and buy it all up cheap."
03/31/2021,stocks,"While you're right about the vaccines, your equation is missing that the EU's third wave is mostly driven from the opposite side of the demographic.

Meaning children. We opened our schools and the infection rate in children age 0-9-15 is as high as it previously was on the opposite end of the spectrum.  
The difference is, that the kids get infected and carry the virus to their families who aren't vaccinated. This shows by the significant increase of infection numbers in the ages of 25-45, which is parent age.

03/31/2021,stocks,">It's carrying on without complaint through grim circumstances and getting the job done 

Brexit was supposed to start a golden age for the UK, why are you mentioning grim circumstances?

>I know its hard for Americans etc to understand but we generally still have some sense of duty to others

I'm Irish, The UK has exported 0 vaccines out of the UK, half of the vaccines used in the UK were from the EU. The UK has also claimed responsibility for vaccines exported to countries like Australia when they were manufactured in the EU.

All while criticizing the EU's approach to mass exportation of vaccines to trade partners and countries in need.

I'm not claiming the EU's approach was handled better, but it is at least it was transparent with what it wanted to do.

You are incontrovertibly wrong when you say the UK has any sense of a ""duty to others"", the British variant of covid is what is currently putting Europe in lockdown, caused by a government that ignored the scientific advice of its own institutions and cares nothing for the mountain of its own dead citizens.

And now the EU has to look like the bad guy, blocking vaccine shipments to the UK in order to make a UK-based company meet its contractual commitments. Apparently, the UK considers the Netherlands as part of its UK supply chain.

The USA has at least started up plans to export vaccines to Canada and Mexico. 

Why don't try reading news from outside the UK bubble?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"> If there's anything the British people specialise in, it's carrying on without complaint through grim circumstances and getting the job done 

It's exactly this mentality that has fucked the country."
03/31/2021,stocks,"This post is embarrassing and your lack of knowledge is astounding, please do some proper research into the efficacy of the first dose of the vaccine, especially in regards to hospitalisations - the cause of lockdowns. Cheers."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Your whole post was absolute balderdash!
There‚Äôs literally no evidence to support anything you‚Äôve said."
03/31/2021,stocks,"UK has opened schools too, and the regular testing seems to have kept rates under control. There won't be any spike in the next 2 weeks either, because the schools are currently closed for the Easter break. So the outlook is much better."
03/31/2021,stocks,"> why are you mentioning grim circumstances?

global pandemic?  massively irresponsible behaviour by the US federal reserve?  large growing threat from China/Russia et al?  the poison of woke ideology?  there's loads of shit going on

> ""duty to others""

i meant duty to other Brits, not to Europe or whoever.  who, might i remind you, were happy to suddenly lock down borders when it came to keeping PPE inside Germany and France.

> Why don't try reading news from outside the UK bubble?

huh?  British news media is obscenely biased in favour of the remain side.  it was literally measured at like 80-something% remain-biased during the referendum run-up.  I barely even look at mainstream news anyway since it's such nonsense"
03/31/2021,stocks,would you care to explain how?
03/31/2021,stocks,"My sources are the published papers of the medical community, statisticians and Virologists like Dr Julian Tang, Not the newspapers or the UK government.

&#x200B;

I listen to the experts and they've been correct sofar, Half the population is not heard immunity, Astrazeneca is not effective against a few variants that are bound to enter the country due to a lack of restrictions.

The government is going to have to issue a third lockdown and they'll more than likely do it too late as they promised it wouldn't happen again. Good luck on your assumptions."
03/31/2021,stocks,"British people have lived through tough times before. Therefore, British people should live through tough times again. Woohoo vote leave etc.

Can you spot the logical fallacy here?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I think you're conflating a 3rd wave with a 3rd lockdown. There will be a 3rd wave, it's inevitable.

However, all of the vaccines have been shown to be highly effective against preventing hospitalisations and death, including in the new strains (and including after 1 dose for an unknown amount of time)

So regardless of a 3rd wave, a lockdown shouldn't happen - because the purpose of the lockdowns was to prevent overflow in the hospitals and therefore excess deaths."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Wishing ill on the British is obviously something of an obsession for you from a glance at your post history. You'll forgive us if we don't quite believe that you're analysing things in an objective manner. 

Cheers for the good luck though, and if it doesn't turn out as you hope, no matter. I'm sure there'll always be British people suffering in some way or another whom you can focus on!"
03/31/2021,stocks,"ah, so you don't have any actual reasoning, just a vague notion based on the conclusion you already wanted to reach

if you're curious about why anyone voted to leave (and i assure you, plenty of people took it very seriously) i might suggest you read the first couple of chapters of ""the weak suffer what they must"" by Yanis Varoufakis.  He might actually be pro-EU for left wing reasons, but his description of how it changed from what started out as a great idea into what has become a very corrupt, unaccountable, anti-democratic bloc

there's lots of things I love about the EU and about being in it.  i think it was a great idea in principle, but it's sadly just become a case of ""so long as Germany is profitable and can dish out some pennies to the pleb nations, then it's all good""

seriously go listen to what they did to Greece.  Or don't, whatever."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I don't wish Ill on the British at all, I wish they hadn't decided to destroy their economy as it's having a knock-on effect on Ireland Economy.

I am invested in the UK's prosperity, It's just not happening. The country is being run by a far-right political party putting ideology above the common good."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the downvotes and the assumption that I'm a blind, dumb partisan.

Yes, I have no doubts that some people did vote to leave from an educated position and I have tried to understand this position but I can't for the life of me. For example, the argument you've just presented to me likens the UK to Greece but not to Germany. You for real? Britain had hands down THE most priviliged position in the entire bloc.

You accuse me of basing my conclusions upon preexisting biases, but that reads a lot like projection here."
03/31/2021,stocks,"C'mon man, you seemingly spend hours commenting going on and on about how fucked Britain is and how it's basically going to be a third world country any day now. If I did the same with regard to, say, France, would you honestly believe for a second that I wasn't hopeful on some level?

It's not that I even think you're totally wrong, this government is a disaster, Brexit is awful and it's probably downhill from here, but you're hugely overstating the case. You don't seem to be stupid and yet you're saying some incredibly silly stuff right now in order to rationalise the belief that Covid is only going to get worse in Britain, as if vaccination doesn't work? Don't try to tell me this is coming from a place of concern, you're definitely willing this to be the case.

It's not the end of the world...it just doesn't make you all that much better than the average hateful Brexit voting Euro hating Daily Express reader. There but for the grace of God go I, eh?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I didn't downvote, i don't do that in discussions so it must have been others

Isn't it a better thing, to give up your supposedly advantageous position for ethical reasons?  Most of us that voted to leave were aware that there'd be difficulties and costs in the short term but this is a way long term matter for me.  I do not approve of the way the EU goes about its business in the slightest

My own government is not much better but i am always in favour of greater devolution since it gives people a better chance to influence decisions"
03/31/2021,stocks,"So you have a HODL mentality towards Brexit.

The way I see it: sure, you could be correct. In the long term, like, a generation or so, there could be benefits for the UK for leaving the EU. There might be benefits for certain members states if the entire bloc was dissolved (though not for all member states, that's just common sense). 

Or, remainers could be right. Perhaps the UK is absolutely shooting itself in the foot. I voted remain, I'm totally partisan on that. I think that the Tories have effectively stripped the country of most of its industry and production over the last decades, so it's a mystery to me how our economy is going to suddenly gain momentum. 

Either way, nobody really knows how this is going to play out. If they say they do, they're lying. So my view was always to remain in the EU as it's the less risky play. 

I take it you live in Scotland?"
03/31/2021,stocks,i was born in Scotland but live in England.  used to live in Wales too.  why did you think i live in Scotland?
03/31/2021,stocks,Because of the comment about 'my own government' and devolution. I was born in England and now live in Scotland. We're like the total inverse of one another lol
03/31/2021,stocks,"fuck you ya colonial sassenach! :D

my goal for the next 5-10 years is to move out into the most wild place i can afford, preferably in Scotland.  cities are shitholes now but its the only place you can find breeding age womenfolk..."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Dude, nolitteringplease346 account is only 4 months old, could be a trolling bot."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Aye, well Edi's okay, as cities go, I like it here at least. The womenfolk sure are a few shades paler than I'm used to though"
03/31/2021,stocks,What does that even mean though? You think he's an AI? Seems unlikely
03/31/2021,stocks,i like pale haha
03/31/2021,stocks,Don't get me wrong - I love pale. It's just that a love session with a *translucent* girl feels more like a science experiment
2021-03-31 13:55:13,stocks,"Discovery and Viacom are massively undervalued after the recent sell-off Discovery Inc (DISCA, DISCB or DISCK) and ViacomCBS Inc (VIAC) are both global media, entertainment and TV providers. They have both recently announced news that they will pursue on-demand TV through online platforms. They provide many thousands of hours of showtime each year with niche focuses such as hobbies and sports, that other competitors such as netflix, amazon prime do not provide. They have a competitive edge in this market and are not just another TV provider.

Furthermore, they were part of a huge sell-off from Archegos who used multiple bank funds and was overleveraged in many positions. After Archegos' positions fell beyond a certain point, it forced the banks to close their positions to make up for the losses that occurred at Archegos. Viacom and Discovery both fell about 50-60% as a result of this making them hugely undervalued and the perfect time to buy the dip and buy the company at a discount.

What this ultimately means is that the price of the company fell, but the value for each of them remained the same. Before the crash, they both were growing like crazy as more investors and asset managers wanted to have them in their portfolios. They were announcing great uptake onto their respective streaming services and have done well during Covid. Both were showing promise and investors valued that as can be seen by an increasing price over several months.

IMO now is a great opportunity to get these companies at a great discount after a huge misstep by a big hedge fund and their partner banks. The excessive volume that is seen in the past days is significantly higher than on an average day before the price drop. Once things calm down both of these companies will begin to grow again and it already seems like it has started.

Disclaimer. I own both of these companies mentioned and I bought more in the past few days."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Have you zoomed out the chart? Viacom is up 28% YTD and Discovery is up 42% YTD. These aren't pre drop, these are after the sell off."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Ah yes, the good old ""stock fell 50%, must be undervalued now""

Not a single valuation, no multiple, not even a mention of the market cap."
03/31/2021,stocks,Wasn't Archegos responsible for pumping the price up anyway?
03/31/2021,stocks,They were overpriced before and are moderately priced now.
03/31/2021,stocks,Are they?? Or were they massively overvalued when the one guy was buying hand over fist??
03/31/2021,stocks,Annnnnnd DISCB goes rocket ship mode today. +104%
03/31/2021,stocks,Maybe we're sold off first for a reason...Idk anything other than;stonks are only worth what you think they are
03/31/2021,stocks,"I have VIAC fairly valued in the mid 40, DISCA in the 30s. I had positions in both but got out last Wednesday premarket when the collapse was clear. I was hoping they‚Äôd fall back to the 20s so I could get back in at what seemed like an undervalued price. But if you believe in the companies fair value is... fair."
03/31/2021,stocks,Stay away at these prices
03/31/2021,stocks,"BIDU is also the same, I grabbed all three two days ago during that sell off!! The funds mistake is your opportunity my friend!"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I think VIAC is near their fair value until they can prove that Paramount+ uptake will go better than CBS All Access did.

I'm not adding to my small stake unless they show that or the price drops about another 7-10% so I can meaningfully average down. 

Long-term I do like their sports play in Europe as well as Latin America and think they have good cross-sale potential between Pluto TV, Paramount+, and Showtime but they have yet to prove it will work, so nothing tells me I can't wait awhile to add to my position."
03/31/2021,stocks,Seems like you're having a good day
03/31/2021,stocks,"So what exactly is the reasoning behind your statement, because obviously a selloff doesn't automatically make them undervalued. They were extremely overvalued before the selloff and likely still quite over valued right now, so what's your bull case on them?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"yes I have zoomed out, I understand they have grown quite well. That is partially due to Archegos, partially due to change in new business. Michael Burry himself holds Discovery, so I doubt it is for shits and giggles.   
After such large price drops, there is often a correction, even if the stock already are higher than before."
03/31/2021,stocks,Yes
03/31/2021,stocks,I think OP is just bagholding.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I that what's appealing about DISCA is that it currently trades at a forward P/E of about 13. So yeah, it's an OK-ish deal right now if you like the historical performance of the company, but if you're confident think it can come close to hitting future earnings targets using its new Discovery+ streaming service, it's actually pretty cheap considering current valuations in the market.   


Not exactly a pure value play because that mindset tends to be conservative, past-leaning. If you're just looking at the past, yeah it's not awesome. If you're willing to speculate on the future, it looks like a good deal."
03/31/2021,stocks,My man!
03/31/2021,stocks,"At what cost price is Michael Burry holding his position in Discovery? From what I can see his cost price is 19.94, which means it‚Äôs already double the price to his cost price. He‚Äôs also selling portions of his holding in Discovery (-50% of the shares sold in Q4 2020). The most recent 13F filing is from December 2020 so it might be the case that he‚Äôs sold all of his position in the most recent run up.. you know, for shits and giggles"

Stumbled across this stock while browsing the ASX list. BET makes software used by wagering companies to place bets for clients. Approximately 700% increase in stock price over the past 12 months. However, the stock is highly overvalued. It is not yet profitable.

I have no problem recommending this if you believe this year will still be bullish for stocks and if you believe the cycle might be turning back to tech soon, it is obviously one of my strongest convictions, even more so at the current price, but the price doesnt even matter that much to me because it's a long hold.

All I can say is spend time searching the Roku DD threads on this sub of this year, and read as much of their news on finviz or Think or Swim as you can from the last 6 months.

If you don't like Roku, you probably think they are just some debt ridden gimmick. Check Yahoo finance, and check how strong the bearish argument really is against them. All I can think of to play devil's advocate is the argument that ""people are going outside again,"" which is ridiculous considering cable cutting is projected to increase YoY and they are locking up that entertainment and more importantly advertisement business of streaming."

03/31/2021,stocks,"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Major market movers today:

**Biden will present his infrastructure plan after market close**

CNBC is [freaking out](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/wall-street-awaits-biden-infrastructure-plan-but-it-may-not-be-ready-for-the-new-taxes.html) about this and acting like the market is going to get terrified by his tax plan, but that doesn't really make any sense because everybody already knows his tax plan.

I expect the market to be trepidatious but filled with wild swings today as people start hedging their bets before he speaks.

**The ADP Employment Report is mixed**

Federal employment data comes out on Friday and is expected to significantly move the market. The [ADP Employment Report](https://adpemploymentreport.com/2021/March/NER/NER-March-2021.aspx), which came out today, is sort of like a sneak preview of what it's going to say.

The report looks bad to me, but, so far, the media and the market are reacting like it's great news. Employment growth did not meet expectations, and, in tech, dropped significantly -- but  [Fox](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/adp-report-shows-biggest-job-gains-since-september), [Reuters](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/u-s-private-payrolls-increase-in-march-adp), and [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/adp-private-payrolls-march-2021.html) are all writing bullish reports on it and NASDAQ futures are going up faster than the Dow or the S&P 500.

So, I don't know. I guess missing expectations is a good thing now.

I'm not going to question it.

Today, I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ high of ~~13,161~~ 13,288 and a low of ~~12,945~~ 13,161.

~~It looks like we're going to open pretty close to 13,161, though, so expect the market to go down shortly after it opens.~~

*EDIT: Looks like I was way too bearish on this one. Looks to me, after open, like we're going up to a high of 13,288.*"

So for it to be economical, you'll need high utilization.  But higher utilization requires long lines which frustrates people.

Lower utilization causes long run cash flow problem.  There isn't a business model yet for operating pure play charging stations.

Gas stations suffer the same problem which is why it only makes money from the convenience store with the gas pumps.

It seems like a Couch Tarde would need to merge with a charging station company for it to work.  Or else charging stations are a great way to lose money in the long run.

For clean tech its better to own solar than charging station stocks because solar will help decrease electricity cost in the long run to make EV fill up  economical.

It's frustrating to constantly have to see debates surrounding incredibly basic and universally accepted principles, so that's where a lot of the pretentiousness comes from.

03/31/2021,stocks,"Really depends on the stock.  There are some valid plays down there, but you are wading into shark-infested waters.  Volatility is very high so you can see .05 to .50 to .03 to .45 in the span of a few weeks, and that is a lot for most people to handle.  Get ready for serious stress.  There are also tons of scam claims thrown around down there since things are less regulated and nothing scares investors more than the fear of it going to 0.

Be cautious.  Take profits on the way up and never fall in love because even the best prospects down there could take a very long time to fully realize their plan.  Swing traders seem to have the most success because momentum and hype are often bigger drivers than real fundamentals so you can almost always sell and then get back in on a pullback and ride it up again.

Oh, and definitely don't invest more than you can lose."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Hoo boy.  You can, and there's a potential for huge gains, but like u/MAMark1 said, it's super volatile and much higher risk than listed stocks.

You really have to do your DD, and even some of the ""good"" penny stock companies will be sketchy.  The bad ones will basically just be shell companies that people shill for pump+dumps.  There are lots of shills in the OTC arena looking to pump stocks beyond their ""fair"" value (if you can even say a penny stock has one), as well as bashers looking to scare investors out.  It's like the scene with a certain gaming retailer's stock, but all the time, for basically any OTC that moves.

But, if you're OK with watching your account value fluctuate wildly, it's even possible to be a successful long-term investor (although short term plays are probably smarter), and if you get in on the ground floor with a company that manages to claw its way out of OTC purgatory, you can make huge returns that you'd never see holding shares of listed companies.

I'd liken it more to playing options trades than investing in shares in terms of risk levels.  I've got a fairly large portion of my portfolio in a penny stock and I've become numb to anything less than a +/-10% swing on a given day there"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Only if you know something the market doesn't, and not because you have insider access.

Nobody issues stock under a dollar.  Those stocks are down there for a reason. Something about their business model broke down or never met expectations. They may have prevented bankruptcy, but their profits aren't what they originally planned, and their growth prospects are dim.

The fact that they're in a hot sector doesn't mean they have growth potential.

Penny stocks are noise, but any noise in them translates to large beta. So you can always find someone claiming they're tradeable. Because you can never find anyone admitting their mistakes."

Debt is still historically cheap, entities are still the place to be, if you actually watched the finance committee hearing last week and sided with the Republicans over J Powell, investing won't be for you (I'm talking to everyone, not literally you).

And lots of other people helping. No, we‚Äôve broken a lot of records. We‚Äôve broken virtually every record. Because you know, look, I only need this space. They need much more room. For basketball, for hockey and all of the sports, they need a lot of room. We don‚Äôt need it. We have people in that space. So we break all of these records. Really, we do it without, like, the musical instruments. This is the only musical ‚Äì the mouth. And hopefully the brain attached to the mouth, right? The brain.

03/31/2021,stocks,Rotation into small cap tech stocks means investor sentiment is shifting into a risk on approach. The nasdaq had been performing better and better relatively speaking over the last week and a half. Especially if you look at the correlation with the 10 year.

03/31/2021,stocks,"It is definitely like finding a needle in a haystack, although there was a recent post on the penny stocks sub about a guy who just shotgunned $1K into the OTC market, buying $25 of each of the cheapest ones he could find.  Many of them were duds, of course, but he was making an overall profit at the time of the post (up 1000% at peak profit).  I'd have my doubts as to whether that's necessarily a reliable strategy, but it certainly takes a lot of the guesswork out.

For me, it's basically just gambling.  I don't have enough expertise to be confident in playing the options game most of the time, but I can spend an hour or two every now and then screening for potentially viable OTCs.  If one happens to do well (or just get hyped), cash out and find the next one.  

The bulk of my investments are in the standard ""safe"" things like index funds, but my penny stock investment is just for fun.  If it really blows up, I'll be able to retire though lol"

You are talking about semiconductor product market share.  ASML is the boss of semiconductor producing equipment (ASML market cap is \~400B, so you can imagine how big it is). Also, the shortage of semiconductor will drive the demand for the equipment, since all producers are now overloaded.

But anyway, you miss the train, everyone knew that and push ASML 20% last week."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I don't know whether it's a good play or not as it's not a company I'm going to do research into, but they make a lot of the machines that manufacturers like TSMC need to make the semi-conductors.

03/31/2021,stocks,"Well sure after today's run ups, prices might be slightly better tomorrow morning than at 3:11 pm today, but not even remotely worth considering form the sales taxes alone.

Why are people determined to come on here and spook people? Why should we ""get ready for tomorrow?"" Why should we even care about tomorrow, if we understand what Powell is doing and how good the stock market looks short and longterm for growth. Why should we care about three months if our horizon is 20+ years?

I wrote a book two days ago about why the cycle was turning back to tech soon, so you better have some good points for me to consider."

You're right about the 3rd person, my apologies, I haven't done social media since internet binged and bonged. I had the idea that ones digital persona ought to be sincere and consistent. But for the sake of gaining the insights of people who are potentially more serious than the casual redditor in r/gme I thought that this would be a good place where I could get a more critical insight and maybe learn from some people who know more than I do. I don't come with any ill-contempt, I desire the well-being of all people and life. I am concerned about things that could cause a lot of harm, I think that this is one of those things. I think that this is potentially a thing to bring to some sort of r/politics thing but I don't understand it enough to be that avatar, at least not yet.

03/31/2021,stocks,"It's not a bad idea to keep an eye on Reddit, although personally I avoid the ones that are already being hyped.  You'll probably have better luck reading through related tickers in comments instead of the one being hyped by OPs.

I tend to watch a stock for a while after I pick it to see how it behaves, before I buy.  Usually, there's no need to hurry into a position. A lot of these OTC stocks will be flat for a long time.  But I have missed the boat on several, and let me tell you it's hard to watch that stock that you were watching print while you sit on the sidelines.  Hard to resist FOMO in that case, but you'll be better off in general if you do.

There's always going to be dramatic price movement on OTCs with any hope of being viable, but a large price spike with the price quickly falling back to where it was previously is a sign that any gain was due to P&D, especially if there wasn't any accompanying news to explain it.

If you're already in before the pump, take advantage of it for sure, but don't go chasing hyped stocks that are already being pumped, IMO.

Finding a decent penny stock can be tough, especially if you want to find one while the price is at its lowest.  Otcmarkets.com has a good screener you can use to filter out some of the chaff, though, and I usually will run a quick scan of any new tickers I see mentioned on Reddit."

Ceasar wanted to bring attention this post to the main discussion because Ceasar wanted to get big brain ""adults"" to look at it

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the\_everything\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/)

Ceasar is worried. Ceasar wanted ""adults"" to think about what is happening but they were mean to Ceasar. They say bad things and take away Ceasar's Karma.

All Ceasar ask is: ""are there any adults in the room that can hold  Ceasar's hand and tell me that everything will be alright? Or maybe  explain what Ceasar can do about this in simple short words, perhaps  with pictures and charts with colorful lines?""

Ceasar wants things to be cool and shiz, Ceasar no want no bad. But if there is bad shiz, Ceasar want to do what Ceasar can to not let shiz get too bad, as to which shiz becomes shiz that we can't deal with shiz...

Ceasar not know how things will go but, Ceasar think that things might eventually go to /r/politics and if Ceasar, or anyone else is going to be our avatar, help on understanding and finding solutions to the problem/corruption at hand would be nice and beneficial to most not super rich people.

They would say, the squeeze is just around the corner and now they say, it might take a whole year or more. They may have realized their unrealistic expectations.
From what I have seen, now they are kind of hyping up some day in June, I'm willing to wager that nothing is gonna happen and prollu another day of a possible catalyst is gonna  come into play."

Volkswagen's US' subsidiary is keeping its name and will not rename itself ""Voltswagen,"" a company spokesman has said, confirming that an earlier announcement was an April Fool's joke that may have gone further than intended.

The German automaker's US subsidiary, which is launching a media blitz for a new all-electric sport utility vehicle, recrafted its social media pages and said the new moniker represents its ""future-forward investment in e-mobility,"" according to a press release that was widely covered.

I just checked the ticker you mentioned (VWAGY) out of curiosity: 

Why is it trading at around 30 USD, while Volkswagen should be trading at around 360 USD?

Also the ticker does not seem to mirror price movement correctly. Volkswagen should be at -2% currently, while VWAGY gives back +12% just now?"
03/31/2021,stocks,Yeah there‚Äôs been some investor confusion around VW tickers lately. Here‚Äôs a recent WSJ article about it: https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/dont-buy-the-wrong-volkswagen-11616586130
03/31/2021,stocks,"Thanks. For anyone reading along, check Volkswagen's Investor Relations page ([English version](https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/InvestorRelations/shares/fact-sheet.html)).

Also VWAGY does track Volkswagen common shares as you stated, but at 1/10 - which explains the price. So 10 VWAGY equal one Volkswagen common share. Price movement not matching is still weird though."

2021-03-31 10:18:26,stocks,"O realty vs actual real estate investing On portfolio analyzer, O realty stock, with dividends reinvested, annual compounded returns was over 14% (!!) since 1994. This is great. They kept their dividends even during 2008 crisis and corona recession. They seem like an amazing company to invest in. My question is, wouldn‚Äôt it be a good idea to just invest in O realty instead of actual real estate? Let them do the work and you basically own their holdings which can be found on their site. Thoughts?"
03/31/2021,stocks,It sounds reasonable only downside I see is you don't get the capital growth as you would owning a property
03/31/2021,stocks,It's easier to afford O than actual real estate. I Love This company.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Others haven't really mentioned but an actual real estate investment, assuming it's a rental, will gain equity in addition to property appreciation.

For the sake of argument, I'm going to use very round numbers and assume the rent = mortgage. It's not quite this simple, but you'll understand my point.

You put down $35k on a 200k SFH, charge 1k/mo in rent, and hold for 5 years.  When you sell the home, your new equity value is $95k. So you've essentially ""profited"" $60k over the 5 year period."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Another difference here is the level of entry. I for one do not have the kind of money that will make retail investing a pipe dream on my side of the coast.

This allows for me to throw a few hundred into someone else's venture. People are right though - there are upsides to physical real estate that you won't find here. 

There is quite a lot of opportunity available to massive real estate corporations that we, as retail investors, will likely not have access to anytime soon if ever. It would be silly not to take a little for ourselves. 

Of course, diversity is always the best. I would do both if I could.

Quick stealth edit because I just remembered a few things:

I have friends and family that are involved in both. Another major factor is time and assets. Physical real estate is a long haul game. You could be worth 10million through real estate but the vast majority of that wealth being the property that other people will be using. 

Some people such as the people that dumped their life savings into places such as Gilbert, AZ get lucky and retire by 25. Most end up sitting on these properties for a long time, slowly seeing appreciation. Its almost always a safe investment if you're in the right locations. Identifying gentrification projects for example is not hard to do by any means. 

Stocks are the same way but its far easier to access your non-liquid access without the major hassle tied into physical real estate. Its hard to get tied up in legal situations with stock as long as you're not doing insane stuff like DFV. 

The people I know involved in real estate in a professional capacity can pull out cards upon cards of lawyers they've worked with over the years. Its not uncommon for people with property all over the place to  be familiar with the counties courthouse."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I like O, I had some until a few months ago, I do not like O at $60. There are similar dividend companies for half the price or cheaper."
03/31/2021,stocks,It could make a good place holder at best....
03/31/2021,stocks,"Leverage. I started with 11k for a downpayment... In 3.5yrs my equity is about 135k (AFTER fees to sell), that's a MUCH better return than some measly 14%/yr on my 11k."
03/31/2021,stocks,"It's the same thing as investing in an ETF to me. When you own an ETF it's safe and it has tons of diversification, but you could probably do better by just owning the best stocks in the ETF portfolio. Of course the risk increases when buying commons, and that's the same when purchasing your own property. 

I personally own property and am looking to buy more, I've also started to fund my roth and have exclusively gone after $O. If you have the means I say buy a good piece of property, if you don't then getting exposure via a REIT has tons of benefits."
03/31/2021,stocks,"It's really comparing apples to oranges, and I don't think there is a single answer that can cover it all. The article below does a decent job going over some of the many variables that one would want to consider with either choice. Certainly, owning real estate is more complex.

[https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-basics/articles/whats-average-return-real-estate-investment/](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-basics/articles/whats-average-return-real-estate-investment/)"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Problem with real estate have always been scaling. As companies grow larger they will have to forgo much of the market. 

As individual owner you could pick your own holdings and locations. With some hard work, 5% cap rate and 15% cash by cash return is all within reach. That's not including possibility of real estate appreciation"
03/31/2021,stocks,"There are many pros and cons. Personally, I would only buy property if there is some other reason than money itself. Having a property can be a big burden in terms of time and attention. It can be painful since time is the most valuable asset we can have. It's important to note that properties are not liquid assets, you cannot really sell a fraction of it, and more difficult to react on market changes. Most of the people forget that simply buying a property is not a good investment. It requires knowledge to know what to buy. If you have those skills, it can be a really good investment."
03/31/2021,stocks,"O is definitely safer than owning real estate directly. That being said, recognize that they're mostly concentrated in 1 type of real of estate(Retail). Buying a REIT index like VNQ will provide exposure to different industries such as offices, industrial, residential, and special real estate(ie datacenters).

Only downside of O vs direct real estate investment is there might be less tax advantages than owning real estate directly. If you know how to invest in opportunity zones there's a lot of tax incentives you can utilize."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Questionable play into the future. I‚Äôd be concerned about the long term impact of interest rates rising. Assets in real estate will decline in value with a rise in interest rates, unless......  inflation takes off.   FYI I‚Äôm a huge fan of owning real estate."
03/31/2021,stocks,"We've never had historically low interest rates for this long, near 0 for well over 10 years, and we are now printing another 2 trillion for infrastructure.  I'm not entirely sure houses will continue going up, theres got to be a period of increasing interest rates at some point unless I'm mistaken."
03/31/2021,stocks,I prefer STOR over O
03/31/2021,stocks,"Depends on how much labor you are willing to put in.

If you are willing to do enough research to find a great house in a growing part of town, refurbishment it, collect rent, fix problems, pay the taxes etc, it‚Äôs probably a better idea to rent out a house.

Or for only somewhat lower returns, buy Realty and reinvestment dividends with no labor involved"
03/31/2021,stocks,"One crap ceo and a couple of bad purchases can make O worthless.

Property, is real and you can touch. one fire/earthquake etc.. Can make property useless.

So both have risks, but I don't think it smart to have all assets tied up in equities. Buying real asset for Diversification is good."
03/31/2021,stocks,"TBH I think physical real estate is highly overrated. Many people have told me ""buy a rental, it's passive income"". It is not passive income, it is a lot of work. So even if you do well with real estate, you've gotta subtract whatever you're paying yourself as an hourly wage for all the work you are doing. And that doesn't even include the added stress of dealing with renters.  


It's also really unclear what the reward will be. I did some research, couldn't find a straight answer as to what the actual profit is from a rental once you subtract all the expenses. I even asked someone who owned rentals and even he wouldn't give me a straight answer."
03/31/2021,stocks,But you also don't get the negatives with that come with owning rental properties.
03/31/2021,stocks,What do you mean by this?
03/31/2021,stocks,"or tax benefits, which are substantive"
03/31/2021,stocks,"But Realty Income does this too. Their property values do go up, and every so often they do distribute cap gains from dispositions."
03/31/2021,stocks,What do you mean
03/31/2021,stocks,But do you think investing in $O is pretty similar to investing in real estate? Monthly dividends acting like rent minus the mortgage.
03/31/2021,stocks,"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
03/31/2021,stocks,Why is that?
03/31/2021,stocks,Yeah that's why there's only one downside I see
03/31/2021,stocks,The property will likely gain value by the time the mortgage is over so you won't get any profit made from this increase in value (it's called capital growth of the asset)
03/31/2021,stocks,"you made up your mind, whats the point in asking people to elaborate when your mind is madeup"
03/31/2021,stocks,Hold a position until you find something better
03/31/2021,stocks,"Kinda, I guess if your putting 100k+ into it you'll get a good return. But I doubt it'll offer you then gains a good property in a good market can provide. If you bought in Seattle your property has appricated in value and you rental income has grow much faster then $O. 

If I had $100k+ Id use it for a downpayment before I would invest it."
03/31/2021,stocks,"And they are both edible, both somewhat spherical, both have a skin and nutrients inside them, both grow on trees, both have their own associated juice...

So yea they are definitely comparable in similarities and differences"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I should start by saying that while I prefer STOR over O, in this current environment some of these REIT's are being and going to be tested. A few reasons why I like STOR is their CEO Chris Volk is an intelligent and experienced leader and most of their leadership team has worked together for years which I think is helpful especially in volatile times. Im not one to pick share price > share quality but I do like STOR at these levels versus O. I am also slightly jaded as I went long with STOR at the $15-17 range and with a 4%+ dividend I don't very well for myself via DRIP. Their net income got cranked pretty hard this past year so I would advise you do your own DD."
03/31/2021,stocks,"But if $O stock price goes up, wouldn‚Äôt that be capital appreciation in itself in a way?"
03/31/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/31/2021,stocks,"It definitely will, I Assumed the price wouldn't go up much if they're giving 14 frikking percent, that's huge. There has to be a compromise somewhere which I thought would be capital growth"
03/31/2021,stocks,what do you mean
03/31/2021,stocks,They‚Äôre not giving 14% dividends. The dividends are 4.39%. The 14% CAGR are dividends reinvested plus stock price growth.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Oh I see sorry misread it, it's interesting and could work.

But personally, with that kind of capital, I'd rather have it safely in real estate as opposed to a company which I have no control over"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I understand. Always pros and cons. With physical real estate investing, it‚Äôs like a part time job and you have to do the work but with reits, they‚Äôre doing the work for you but you don‚Äôt have control. A major pro with reits though, is that it is highly liquid. You can sell at any given second while real estate, you can‚Äôt."

03/31/2021,stocks,"Watch out for the mREITs.

When the Fed starts selling assets, they'll be selling mortgage-backed securities, the type of assets that mREITs are allowed to leverage 9X. A 10% drop in MBS prices is a 100% drop in mREIT holdings.

The dividends are fantastic, but with the FED balance sheet so high and the inflation sabers being rattled, it won't take much for them to start selling to take cash out of public circulation, and mREITs will be the heads that roll first."
03/31/2021,stocks,"The way I see it is if your 30 and you buy dividend stocks that pay 3% you will get good growth of say 10% to 15% + the 3%  dividend also as you get closer to retirement the growth will slow in the dividend will increase to about 5% to 6% just in time for you to draw on your portfolio 

If you buy a dividend stock with a 7% dividend now it will likely only have 1% to 3% growth and that's not so good as at 30 yrs old you don't need dividend income you need growth"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Because of the way companies like EPD are structured, they're basically passing their income onto it's unit (share) holders, similar to how an S-Corp functions.  What that means for you, is that the distributions are considered return on capital (until a certain point), and not income.

Every time you get a distribution, it's basically reducing the cost basis of your unit (share), which you don't have to technically pay for until you realize the profit by selling the share.  The K-1 keeps track of how much of your distribution is capital gains, and how much of it is income (if you've held long enough to reduce your cost basis to $0).

Investopedia probably explains it a little better if you want to check it out [here](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/062515/mlps-how-they-are-taxed.asp).  But the jist of it is, you have to keep track of more things than just being paid a dividend/distribution."

2021-03-31 09:51:49,stocks,"Quick Reminder: Having a portfolio consisting of different tech stocks does not mean you have a ‚ÄòDiversified Portfolio‚Äô To whom it may concern: (I‚Äôm aware most of you know how to properly diversify). 

I see some investors on here being invested in multiple tech equities, APPL, TSLA, AMZN, SONO etc. and talking about how well diversified their portfolio is. 

Just a quick reminder than having a diversified portfolio means that you have equities with ‚Äònegative correlation‚Äô, and/or no correlation in addition to being diversified into different asset classes (equities, fixed-income, cash)(ex. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETF‚Äôs). 

Or into different market caps, levels of risk, growth/value, sector/industries as well as domestic and foreign investments. 

Any political, economical, or social catalysts that can affect the tech industry will most likely affect all your investors at the same time, in the same way, therefore just a quick reminder that having a portfolio consisting of only techs does not reduce the overall risk in your portfolio, and if anything, increases it, as such, you are not ‚ÄòDiversified‚Äô.

This doesn‚Äôt just apply to techs, it applies to any portfolio that only has positively correlated assets within the same sector/industries.

Edit: This post is about the concept of having a diversified portfolio, not rate of return or investment objectives, capital limitations etc. Pls keep comments and topics relative to diversification."

03/31/2021,stocks,I like both kinds of music: Country AND Western.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Ill add that it takes about 20 positions that are low correlated and in different industries to diversify non systematic risk. Systematic risk is always a factor unless you run short positions. Or move a portion into a different asset class like bonds. 

Example. If you just wanted to be long tech, you could just buy apple, or 20 tech companies. If apple had negative news and that's 100% your portfolio, your going to be down on the day (non systematic). If you had 20, then your portfolio might end up, because of the diversification. But does this mean we are safe from overall market risk? No, obviously because if the Nas is down, it's very likely no matter how good the news is for a selection of tech stocks in your portfolio, your going to be down on the day (systematic risk) there is a twist, even if your diversified over many industries, on a sell off day and correlations go to 1, you will also be loosing money (systematic risk) no amount of eggs in your basket is going to help you. 

Running partial short positions or options strategies, on the worst performers is the only way you can close the systematic risk envelope. 

To sum, gross exposure is your best friend when things get wobbly, not diversification and you really need to pay attention to the composition of the entire portfolio. Some people cant/rather not short as it doesnt fit their strategy, that's fine, just be aware that triming down some of the high beta names is a really effective way to control drawdown."
03/31/2021,stocks,I agree with your post but I think it's better to aim for uncorrelated stocks than negatively correlated stocks although obviously it's not an exact science
03/31/2021,stocks,"I agree, but being diversified in tech is a thing. Sure the tech sector could take a hit and it all goes down but individually they can shine and you can rotate holdings in the sector. But totally you're right being overall diversified would not be the case there. 

The whole argument of diversification between securities or overall market with holding fixed income and stocks and whatever can really be broken down into literally risk per percentage of portfolio. If you have all of your cash in tech stocks and tech sector gets crushed guess what? You lose money and can't do anything can't pay bills whatever. But if you have 30% in tech stocks, 30% in commodities or whatever and 30% in cash and then the tech sector gets crushed guess what? You lose money on 30%, might gain on 30% and then have 30% of cash to average down or to wipe your tears. Just a stupid extreme example but it shows there's a bare minimum of diversification that should be followed."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I'm confused about diversification, b/c when people say tech stocks they have in mind companies like AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, INTC, GOOGL.  But when you look at a heat map like the one on finviz (https://finviz.com/map.ashx), these companies are spread out over 3 different categories.  For instance MSFT/AAPL are tech, GOOGL is consumer services, and AMZN is under consumer cyclical.  Is their method of categorization giving a false sense of diversification?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Thank you. I have enough of sll those people here crying because ‚Äûthe whole market tanks‚Äú. Yeah, palantir, snowflake and Tesla is not proper diversification."
03/31/2021,stocks,Tech is no longer a sector. It is a foundational piece of your business. So I disagree. I think buying into companies that use tech differently is diversification.
03/31/2021,stocks,Hush! I‚Äôm having the best day in 6 weeks like a young Cathy Woods over here
03/31/2021,stocks,"Agree, tech stocks were disproportionately down from Mid Feb compared to cyclicals, value and others.

I use these categories and am always rotating weightings specially when some stocks have exceeded their target prices or if something new and interesting comes up.

1. Fast Growers - Tech, media (TSLA, AMZN, FB. GOOGL, NVDA, 
2. Cyclicals - across industries, whatever moves with the economic and / or industrial cycles - GS, JPM, MRO, FCX, MU, F, GM
3. Stalwarts -  staples such as CO, P&G
4. Special Situations and Asset Plays - sometimes real estate and often sum of their parts being greater than their market cap.
5. Turnarounds including deep value - BBBY
6. Dividend plays including utilities -  go with specialized dividend funds.

Most of these are based on Peter Lynch's groupings/categories and also have some of Warren Buffet's stock picking characteristics.

There will be overlaps and often fast growers evolve into stalwarts - but it's important to understand that each group has its own characteristics and valuations and multiples.

Happy investing!"

Diversifying into stocks just for the sake of diversifying isn't good either.  A dying market will lose you money and a thriving one will make you money.  Right now, there's a semi-conductor shortage and demand for new tech is very high.  I have tech financial, tech automotive, tech consumer cyclical, tech industrial, even tech raw materials (yes that's a thing).

This also doesn't account for market manipulation.  Steel stocks were going up for a few weeks but steel prices didn't budge.  This was caused by manipulation and if you're diversifying into a pump and dump you could lose big.

So I completely agree that your long-term portfolio needs exposure to multiple factors and not such growth/single industry. You can play around with allocation to various factors even if a factor (eg. value) hasn't had great performance relative to others over the last decade. A quick read of Markowitz theory might help ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markowitz\_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markowitz_model)).

Since then, I‚Äôve been eyeing KO and I‚Äôve studied the graph almost daily to explain when certain dips happen, and playing with options on KO to help increase my profits in the mean time. I usually take profits of $10-15 on most options because I just want to secure the bag and walk away without getting greedy like I was initially. Otherwise, my money is in KO and a couple other dividends stocks to help me slowly grow over a long period of time. If I see something that I think has the potential to spike, I‚Äôll buy in at what I think is a reasonable amount of my portfolio to risk, and so far I‚Äôve only pulled in profits. I‚Äôve only made like $50 in almost 2 weeks, but I also plan to deposit monthly so I can increase positions and be a little more aggressive as I learn more too.

You have to account for the fact that you cant control all the variables and hedge accordingly.

Also, individual stocks do *not* go up over time. Generally most stocks stagnate, go down, or go up slightly while a select few skyrocket. It is only the market as whole that goes up slowly over time. 40% of stocks drop by 70% or more and never significantly recover."

>from what i understand if you have wealth/something to protect diversifiy, if you want to generate wealth concentrate

You have been taught wrong, concentrating your money is an example of what's called *unsystematic risk*, unsystematic risk is not compensated for because it can be arbitraged away. When you diversify into the whole market, you take on what's called *systematic risk*, and it cannot be arbitraged away. since it cannot be arbitraged away, it is compensated for (in the form of excess returns). You may get lucky and make a lot of money on a single stock, but it was not skill, it was luck and your chances of getting lucky repeatedly diminish exponentially with time. The fastest reliable way to build wealth is the method with the most consistent and positive returns, that method means taking on full systematic risk, with zero unsystematic risk."

I'm in it for the short-term trade - all the dd's been done and is already out there.

03/31/2021,stocks,For shizzle. Still holding that bad boy
03/31/2021,stocks,"Because the stock market as a whole gives better returns than treasuries, so if you hold the whole market (or a significant portion of it) then you get those returns. The main problem is that while some stocks do significantly outperform treasury bills, it is nearly impossible to predict which ones those will be. Because if it was obvious, people would rush in to buy it, raising the price. This will continue until the potential profit is significantly reduced. In our age of automated investing this happens almost instantaneously.

Since all the obvious known outperformers are arbitraged away, it leaves only the unknown outperformers left to actually outperform the market. The reason they are unknown is because the reason they will outperform hasn't been revealed yet. 

For example, let's say you buy some Domino's Pizza stock at $370/share, then three years later a massive cheap shitty pizza trend hits tiktok and sales of Domino's skyrocket. Suddenly, they're making a ton more money and the stock has tons more earnings/share, now tons more investors want in, buy the stock, and cause the price to double. In this case, yes, Domino's stock outperformed the market, but only because of a weird trend that no one could have predicted. That is how nearly all outperformers happen, because of unknown information. Because again, if the information was known it would be arbitraged away."

Unsystematic risk is the way for small investors to gain enough capital to then play the systemic risk game (which is how you retain wealth, diversification, but to gain it yoloing on a stock is still probably the best bet, for the individual small time investor, is it risky sure, but spreading among a small portion of the market IE 5-10 stocks isn't much different)

03/31/2021,stocks,Yeah. Again I‚Äôm not saying be sold it all. He definitely sold some shares but is still holding a bunch.
03/31/2021,stocks,"it sounds like you're misinterpreting what an ETF is, and ETF is not synonymous with an index fund or even market diversification, it's just a category. An ETF is simply a collection of stocks sold as a single stock. So yes, there are some sketchy ETFs, I could start an ETF right now for 8 companies that I started yesterday and that would be sketchy as fuck. You should not look at whether something is an ETF or not, you should look at what is being held. If it is an index ETF like VTI or VOO then that's not sketchy, in the same way that Apple as a tech stock isn't sketchy but Flobbletech Industries established 3/31/21 as a tech stock would be sketchy.

And you don't have to do it through an ETF either, you can buy market diversification through index funds and mutual funds like VTSAX or FZROX."
03/31/2021,stocks,"For sure just FYI, just interesting that he posted another update today."
03/31/2021,stocks,"No i meant the fundemental way an ETF functions, as in how the basket is created from nothing and then later bought."

2021-03-31 08:20:40,stocks,"Building a long portfolio for newer investors and understanding individual sectors. I have found that the newer traders are the ones that are getting hit hardest the most. I understand why, I've been into stocks for years at this point, and many laughed at my picks in may because I didn't dabble in many of the high flyers or ""meme stocks."" 

While I did miss out on gains because of my risk tolerance, instead I have solidified a solid growth and value portfolio that has worked for me throughout covid and even before. Many of the people that make a lot of money quickly in the market, underestimate the difficulty that it actually takes when the market inevitably calms down. This past year was a result of market euphoria and an astronomical amount of greed, which left many who had unrealized gains, with unrealized losses, and they are confused about what to do. 

When I first started investing, I have seen this scenario and I fell prey a bit. An example that comes to my mind was W.A.TT, a zombie company who spiked to 20$ only to be a worthless stock now. I cut my losses early, but it was lucky I did, because I wasn't knowledgeable to even know why I bought it aside from the point it was vertical. 

After that, I got smarter and bought nvidia, for around $200 a share, and then when at the end of 2018, the market sputtered and nvidia corrected heavily due to the nature of it's sector. I unknowingly screwed myself out of future gains because I didn't know the financials and didn't read enough, and I bought the RIGHT company, for the wrong reason. I sold for a loss. If I had held that, (and my other speculative, GREAT, buys, my portfolio would've tripled in 3 years. But I didn't understand why the stocks move downward. 

This is long and I apologise, but by doing the wrong things, it's led me to doing the right things, and my portfolio is calm and gaining through covid and through this rotation. When it comes to individual stock picking, you have to treat it like a job and read. Read everything you can. When it comes to market sentiment, it should almost be irrelevant. All stocks will go down, but if you hold stocks that you know won't stay down, you're stress levels will not be as high as someone who jumped into something with no entry or exit strategy. 

I will say that this isn't necessarily a guide and I won't give any specifics on how much of anything you should have, but understanding what should be present in a solid, safer growth/value portfolio to avoid losing large chunks of money during cyclical swings and market moves. Losing money is unavoidable in the market at some point, but being in a position to where it won't destroy confidence or your portfolio, is avoidable, and with work very achievable. 

A solid base for a portfolio is necessary, and I would say it should almost always include dividend stocks that you are willing to go long on. Safety should be majority of your portfolio, the big blue chips are boring, but they are your anchors, and will let your portfolio breathe naturally on down and up days and mitigate large swings. If youre like me and choose to use margin for leverage, dividends pay for your margin interest as well, but I don't recommend margin to people as it involves larger risk in general. 

The next part Is what helped me during covid so much, you look ahead and start to think of things as a contrarian, and realize that not all of your picks are correct, and you may need to adjust accordingly based on fundamentals. NEVER get attached to a stock, sometimes if you get gains on a speculative pick, you should take them, especially based on the market in late 2020. The rotation was written on the wall. 

Banks are safe havens as well, but more fickle, I own many banks but for me, I would not open positions on them now, I have however , since I've owned them, averaged up, which lowers my overall gains, but leaves me with much more room to fall before I have to potentially adjust the position, IF, the fall in price is a reflection of fundamentals.

Value stocks are getting less valuable. When you're building a portfolio, knowing how to find and assess value is important and ultimately up to the individual. A simple thing I do, which many may not agree is, I pick 3 stocks, one risky, one safe, and one moderate. I'll use the examples respectively, beyond meat (risk) , simply good foods (moderate) and kraft heinz. They all are completely different companies with vastly different markets I understand, but they all expose to food space with different amounts is risk in a sector. Now kraft may be a great base to my portfolio, but do I need less risk? Or is my dividend and safety base at a level where I am comfortable? Then I'd evaluate my overall portfolio risk tolerance and see if first of all, any of my picks should even be in my portfolio, and I usually will try and think and discover reasons why they don't, rather than why they should. 

Tech is something I do not like exposure to majority of the time, i keep it under 10%. But many great growth stocks are tech, but patience and cash are the next part of a portfolio, holding a cash position is important for being able to patiently wait and open riskier positions at a safer price, which in the cyclical nature of say, semiconductors (currently relative), can be hard. Opening a position in a good, healthy TECH, company all at once is not the best move in my opinion. Opening a position with the view that it may go down and will give you exposure and potential to average down, is a good mindset. Tech is a fickle industry and cyclical, and earnings are less important than guidance, unless the market is the way it is now, in which value is stealing the spotlight, imo, providing cheaper/ish entries to tech. 

Oil will always provide dividends, and by their nature will let you average down. Oil especially, as a regulated business due to opec, you are at the mercy of a business that is not really traded on the free market. Supply and demand will sometimes get so out of synch and provide good buying opportunities. I bought oil early, in may, halliburton , exxon suncor and devon. Contrarian plays last year, but this year's quick in and out fad. It took patience, but I cashed out quite nicely, and still hold some for the dividends. 

Industrials, deserve a part in anyone's portfolio. It goes without saying that this should be a decent chunk of your portfolio, they are cyclical ny nature and may swing based on office encumbants and world issues, but they are the backbone of the world and when you can pick a convicted and tried and true winner, can be of great value and safe , long term growth. 

Commodities are commodities and always should have some exposure, these are stocks that I tend to adjust the most, as they face fundamental changes often and are subject to world trade/trends sometimes (clothing). When it comes to food, I tend to pick safer, dividend oriented companies, I try to pick these up only if I see them with great value attached, near all time highs, I tend to wait and watch. 

Mining stocks are good to go right now, but they are a bit risky, ones with dividends and in relation to precious metals may see a bit of a boom, but that is honestly and industry I don't dabble in much, I have my picks, but due diligence and understanding how they make money is important.

In my opinion, risk is for chumps, anything over 3% of your portfolio in gamblingesque stocks, is a bit more fugazzi than it is fun, and can lead to impulsive moves of you don't regulate your mindset. Also, this is about portfolios and for newer people who may have had a hard time with this VERY SMALL market move that somehow ruined people's portfolios. Limited risk does not mean limited gain. Unless your a trader. And I'm not, so I'm boring. But I make money, I hope any of this helps. Went on a bit long but I wanted to get into some sectors that have really helped me since before covid, and throughout as well since I was able to recognize the bargains in price. 

The more you watch the numbers, the better you understand the numbers. But don't watch them everyday, or you can become paranoid, be convicted, do research, and whenever buying anything, that behind the stock, it has fundamental value. Even growth stocks that get slashed in half SOMETIMES can be good holds, but you must be prepared to adjust of you're not right. Knowledge is power, and knowledge will keep your money busy."

That's only one stock that made me 250% gains in less than a year, but I still like having the safety net of a broad portfolio to hold me down."
03/31/2021,stocks,"The safe profits you accumulate from a portfolio are what should be used to mitigate risk, and I believe being able to build a strong portfolio is a skill any investor should have.

Corporate taxes are changing and investors are just scared people in general when it comes to change. Knowing when to hold and average down is someones personal preference. A lot of people make a lot more money than me, this was just my rundown of what should make up a safer portfolio and a way to hopefully mitigate larger losses if little shakes in the market make you realize you're true risk tolerance isn't what you thought it was.

2021-03-31 07:16:02,stocks,"FTC sues Illumina (ILMN) to block vertical integration with Grail In an unusual move, the Federal Trade Commission announced that they have filed suit to block genetic sequencing leader Illumina‚Äôs (ILMN) $7.1B merger with the liquid biopsy company Grail.

Interestingly, Grail was founded as a subsidiary of ILMN and was spun off. After filing to go public, Grail announced that they had entered into an agreement for ILMN to buy the rest of the company.

It is the FTC‚Äôs position that ILMN may stifle competition in the emerging liquid biopsy market. Because ILMN holds a monopoly on short read sequencing, their competitors in the liquid biopsy space have no choice but to use ILMN‚Äôs products. Thus, the FTC believes the acquisition of Grail is anti-competitive.

Interestingly, ILMN used to be one of the largest holdings in the ARKK and ARKG ETFs. Cathie Wood chose to divest after ILMN announced the acquisition of Grail because she believed it would put ILMN in direct competition with their competitors. 

This is the second time in 40 years that the FTC has blocked a vertical integration. They sued AT&amp;T to block the integration with Time Warner Cable, which ultimately failed.

Interestingly, this is the second time in two years the FTC has sued to block ILMN‚Äôs acquisitions. They previously sued ILMN to block their merger with PACB. Ultimately ILMN and PACB terminated the merger.

Exact Sciences recently completed a horizontal integration to acquire the liquid biopsy company Thrive, which was not challenged.

Personally I believe this will take some time to wash out and I expect a bigger correction in ILMN stock. I believe this represents an opportunity for entries into a long position in ILMN. I have a hard time believing this merger won‚Äôt go through.

Long $ILMN."
03/31/2021,stocks,"ILMN dropped from 350 to 300 on high volume, then wandered up to 500 on lower volume, then dropped to where they are, 368, on high volume.

Last time they went up on high volume was from 170 to 200, back in 2017.

I expect continued correction. I'd put my price target at 225.üëº"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Any additional info on why you like ILMN long term? I don't know too much about the sequencing field. My understanding is that ILMN has the lion's share of the market now but is being disrupted by PACB and others (the ""long"" vs ""short"" sequencing which I don't really understand). Is that a concern for holding ILMN long term? Will it lose market share to new, disruptive players?"
03/31/2021,stocks,I own PACB stocks and i must say the biotech sector is a hell of a ride.
03/31/2021,stocks,Wait so short term you think ILMN will drop more or is this your ideal price point?
03/31/2021,stocks,"They got to about $250 intraday on the Grail acquisition news.

I think they could get there again. Would be a nice entry.

ILMN has been overpriced for a long time with little growth. Everyone‚Äôs expecting a huge explosion in revenue that hasn‚Äôt come yet. 

Let‚Äôs hope they get there"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôm more familiar with gene editing, but I‚Äôm trying to get into the sequencing space as well. From what I understand you‚Äôre right, the main advantage is the current dominance in the market. Pacb is a competitor, but right now there aren‚Äôt enough reasons for clients to switch companies. Part of it is that the machines are huge investments, so it would take a really drastic advantage for a hospital or university core decide to switch its entire instrumentation."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Potentially, yes. But short read sequencing is not going anywhere. It‚Äôs very accurate. 

ILMN is basically a monopolist in genetic sequencing, and there is a lot of excitement about applications that can be built on top of sequencing: editing, health information, liquid biopsy, etc.

ILMN sells the shovels for the genetics field and is the most important company right now.

I think COVID has created an enormous tailwind for this industry. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm bullish"

Our business has a lot of exposure to the energy industry and we are seeing companies file bankruptcy and continue layoffs (in the last 60 days). A lot of the attitude is that drillers aren't going to jump back in with the push away from oil which could definitely drive prices higher if demand does pick up (or we will start importing more). I was just curious what you guys may be seeing first hand rather than relying on the media to tell me how great our economy is doing (or will be doing shortly).

I also wish we had a better way to monitor inflation then relying on the fed. It sure seems like everything is a lot more expensive. Transitory is a good excuse but I don't know that things will settle down that quickly."

03/31/2021,stocks,"Live in a rural area in the northern Midwest. House values are increasing, but not as quickly as I would have expected especially given the location. 

Pretty much every business I know of is hiring people and a lot of them have shortages of employees right now, especially the local government agencies. I live in a town of about 10,000 but we're the largest one in a 60 mile radius so all the big retailers, chains, etc in the area are here. I think Wendy's is starting people at like $14.25 an hour or something. This would have been taken as some kind of prank 2 years ago if I saw it in an advertisement.


The town I live in is the type of place where there's a lot of rich people with houses, but they stay empty for half the year. There's also a much higher proportion of seniors than average. It's a solidly conservative place, although lately support for environmental protections and concern about climate change has increased substantially. And given the political makeup of the area, it was already higher than one would probably expect. I'm mostly basing this off of the number of people I see recycling things, the number of businesses advertising some sort of green initiative, the local government's adoption of free recycling and composting programs, and the general chatter I hear about how this winter has been so much warmer than normal that people are worried about the future. But my conclusion is essentially that pretty much everyone thinks climate change is real and most of them are wanting the government to do something big to address it.

 I used to work at an inpatient addiction treatment facility, and the people I know that still work there are telling me that significantly fewer clients are coming in for treatment. It used to be full all the time with a 3-month waiting list, now there's a few extra beds on any given day. That could, of course, be a result of fewer people seeking treatment due to covid. However, I also have a lot of friends who are former drug addicts or some who are currently struggling with their use, and they've told me that a lot of people got clean over the pandemic. Or at least towards the end of it. Apparently supply was very difficult to get and the stimulus, and unemployment money from the government allowed addicts to actually pay for their own housing and stabilize their lives enough to get jobs. The ones who chose to spend their stimulus money in a different way have mostly ended up overdosing or getting arrested, by the sound of it (not due to fraud, just excessive drug use and resulting consequences).

I run a technology consulting business. We help small and mid size (relative to the area) businesses figure out if they could benefit by incorporating any form of blockchain technology into their operations. I started it about 3 years ago, just as a side project without much work ever put in. Over the past 6 months or so, when I'd nearly forgotten about the business entirely, we've been getting more requests for an initial consult (we offer them free) every week than I had over the first two years the business existed. I've been having to tell potential clients that it would be months before I can even start a thorough review of their business's possible benefit. I've also just been responding to certain businesses with an immediate no, based on what they do. It seems like every business owner in the area is under the impression that they can somehow massively reduce costs with blockchain. Not that some of them can't benefit, sometimes substantially, but it's not going to seriously help most small businesses save money with what's currently available. I try to make this clear to people who contact me but many of them still insist that they need to ""have blockchain"", usually when they're updating/repairing/establishing their networking systems and IT hardware. 

I'm sure most of this information is not that helpful for investing purposes but maybe somebody will see something that I don't here. I just liked your question so much because I enjoyed reading everybody's answers.

Vinyl products and anything plastic (windows/siding) have gone from 1-3 week lead times to 2-3 months for windows and 3-4 months for siding.

Engineered wood products are becoming scarce now -- which is a problem for the way homes are designed these days. Floor and roof systems that are spec'd for I joists and LVLs can't just convert to pine when they can't get the materials. 

Steel products have had multiple price increases as well.

My spouse's restaurant is still at 50% capacity limitation, but they're doing great, the takeout didn't go down when the 50% seating was added back. The problem is hiring, there aren't enough workers.

People I know that were struggling when the pandemic started are all working lots of hours (usually from home) and are doing better than they have in years.

The administration isn't ""pushing hard against oil,"" there is this thing called global warming that has changed consumer preferences, and renewables are cheaper for energy use. People whine and cry and say it isn't so, but they only say it because 20 years ago renewables were more expensive and so they started saying it; now they're still saying it. They're emotionally and politically invested in it remaining true, even though 20 years ago they were told that eventually, renewables would be cheaper.

03/31/2021,stocks,"I live in eastern Canada, so not the US, and not the more populated regions of Canada, but from my POV at work (warehouse) we're busier than we were this time last year, which makes sense as ecommerce gains market share every year regardless of covid. Homes are selling at or above asking price within days which never happened before covid. Homes selling faster creates a better market building new homes so hence lumber and the materials needed to build homes have been increasing, but that's due to supply and demand and likely has nothing to do with inflation, which in my day to day life I haven't seen anything going up, except gas, but even gas is just back to the regular price it was this time last year.

tl;dr - Supply and demand is causing housing materials to increase where I live, gas is back to precovid prices, homes are selling faster than ever before (low interest rates caused this I assume?) and business is booming for just about everyone. Honestly everything looks fine. If everyone wasn't still wearing a mask then I probably wouldn't have noticed anything different.

Basically meaning just supply and demand and not so much inflation. 

Just curious what your take is on that, because where I live in eastern Canada ( and I assume all of North America at this point ) is seeing the same thing happening. It's just my assumption that it has nothing to do with inflation and everything to do with supply and demand which was caused by low interest rates. Just curious to see your opinion."

It started at the beginning of the pandemic when early points in the supply chain started getting shut down during outbreaks or had to operate at half capacity. At the same time demand has been steady. Above average in some areas, just slightly under in others. 

My point on the housing market is that new construction home supply may decrease when they get held up by material shortages which will put an even greater strain on realtors. Homes are selling 50k over asking in some instances. 

Whether it's inflation or not? I can't say because I only took a few macro classes in college and have no idea. I just know from my view here at the retail level things aren't normal and it's more than likely driven by the low interest rates."

2021-03-31 06:36:07,stocks,"Would stagflation make the stock market go up or would it make it go down? If we're in a recession, the stock market would (under normal circumstances) go down. But if there's inflation, the price of securities would increase the same way the price of typical goods would increase (right?). So what would happen if both inflation and a recession happens at the same time?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"In terms of actual value, sideways."
03/31/2021,stocks,Oof stagflation is a rough scenario. It'd create a black swan event in the market for sure. Bad monetary policy in the 70s in response to oil price shocks from OPEC created stagflation and crashed the markets.

03/31/2021,stocks,It would very much down or at best stagnant. Stagflation is rough for the economy its no growth coupled with inflation and yea its sucks you do not want stagflation at all.
03/31/2021,stocks,"The stag means stagnant, as in the markets aren't moving.

When that happens and there's inflation in consumer prices and wages, the effect is that the relative value of equity is going down.

The last time this happened was the late '70s. Shortly thereafter we started a period that has not ended yet where the value of equity keeps going up but consumer prices and wages are relatively flat.

In many ways it's obvious that that is deliberate on the part of the people who now own our government."
03/31/2021,stocks,"look to Japan as reference if concern with stagflation, they've been in it for decades."
03/31/2021,stocks,"The US can't have stagflation, because we'd have to choose it. We're the world's reserve currency, and there are not even any competitors for that position. (See also: Brexit)

In a country that can't prevent it, stocks trend down, though generally sideways, because if they were going down fast you'd be in worse shape than a recession. The only modern example is Japan's ""lost decade,"" though it took longer than a decade to fully recover.

You're probably thinking that stock prices are based on the company's profit or something, that's a critical fundamental error you should study until you understand and have internalized that it isn't true. Public companies have about 10x the equity value of private companies. Those private companies are valued based on their profit, or profit potential at least. So publicly traded companies are not priced based on their earnings. They're priced based on the share of people who want to invest in the economy's growth; the amount of money people are investing. In a recession, the real money people have to invest is normally going down; people have other things to spend it on. If the economy is shrinking, that pool of investment money is shrinking, so by definition the stock market is shrinking. It doesn't matter of inflation means that the numbers are going up; the more inflation during a recession, the worse shape the economy is in, the more the investment pool is shrinking. If you're not falling into a depression, and you have inflation, and you have a recession, that already means that stock market is trending slightly down.üëº

Stagflation requires inflation, of which japan has had none of."
03/31/2021,stocks,We had stagflation in the 70s.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Nah we're good. The Fed is letting the interest rates creep up, GDP is improving, and the unemployment rate is improving. 

The Fed uses the interest rates to control inflation and unemployment. It may freak people out a little (and subsequently the markets) to see inflation increase, but it's actually putting people back to work. There's a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment that most people don't understand. Look up the Phillips Curve if you're curious. 

That doesn't mean we won't have a bumpy road ahead though. Biden is coming out with an aggressive infrastructure bill and it's unclear where the financing will come from specifically. Additionally, it will also serve as a jobs program, but estimates of its impacts to GDP from the CBO remain to be seen. We'll just have to wait for their cost benefit analysis once a bill is actually on the table. 

With all that said, I've been seeing an increase in technical analyses predicting a major pullback. The Skew index is also through the roof. So while I'm not worried about stagflation specifically, I think there may be an event coming. No clue when, but it's pretty obvious we're in a stock market bubble. It could pop in a week or a year and who knows what will trigger it. 

It's also fair to note that I've been liquidating a lot of my random positions and rolling them into more stable stuff (and sitting on cash). I've been trading a lot of short term options as well. It's just my particular strategy and I might be being overly cautious. But I'd rather be safe than sorry. I encourage you to seek out ways to protect yourself while still making money along the way."

03/31/2021,stocks,"No, I do. You literally just have to look up the definition of stagflation to know you are spewing false information.

By definition stagflation is no growth plus high inflation. Japan has deflation, therefore they are not in a stagflation environment, nor have they been.

If you want an example of stagflation, look at 1970s usa."
03/31/2021,stocks,We left the gold standard in 1971 and had stagflation around 1973ish.
03/31/2021,stocks,"so the world economic forum and economist is wrong when it comes to Japan's economy and you're right? 

lol"
03/31/2021,stocks,I didn't say that. I said something else.
03/31/2021,stocks,Are we confusing stagnation with stagflation?
03/31/2021,stocks,"Stagnation != Stagflation.

Buy a dictionary."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Sorry, it's difficult to decipher what exactly you're on about in a conversation about stagflation. I think you've been hitting the weed stocks a little too much ;)

you guys think a stagnant economy is worst than a deflationary economy like Japan? then I ha e news for you."
03/31/2021,stocks,Lol
03/31/2021,stocks,"which came first stagnation or deflation? you seem to think you've got this right....

deflation is literally the end result of stagnation and stagflation in which Japan has continued to struggle with."
03/31/2021,stocks,"So, throw insults? Is that ok here?

You didn't understand me. If you want to talk to me, stop talking about weed, and figure out what I said. It wasn't the US currency is our own reserve; it is that we're the world's reserve currency. Prior to that, the world used gold. When the US stopped using gold is not relevant, and I didn't talk about it.

Don't throw insults. This isn't the place for that."
03/31/2021,stocks,I thought they had deflation.
03/31/2021,stocks,"First of all, this is false. Japan had stagflation in the 70s just like we did.

But also the when spy corrects it's usually around 10 to 15 % . And this happens once a year. Or once every other year. 
If spy on the avg goes up 8% a year over time, it would be safe to assume holding a large portion of cash and waiting for a pull back would be better than DCAing into SPY. 

Full disclosure I'm having a hard time lump sum buying SPY at all.time highs when weeks or.months from now I can get it 10% cheaper."
03/31/2021,stocks,"when is it going to pull back? is it next week or next year?

spy is at 394 right now. yeah, you can wait for a 10% correction, but that 10% correction might be at 450 in 6 months and you've basically missed out on the train ride up and buying it at 405 when you could've just bought at 394


personally, i think just buying every week is the most optimal strategy but its really just up to whatever makes you happy. if you can time the market bottom, you'll be a genius. the problem is, you can't."
03/31/2021,stocks,"
 - SPY 10 year performance is: 13.31% (not ""8%"")       
 - SPY pays an annual dividend of $5.563    
 - When your plan's success relies on knowing the bottom of the dip, and you don't know the future, it is a flawed plan.    
 - *Likely* outcome: You'll sit on your cash for too long, waiting for ever bigger dips (based on historical trends, that may no longer hold true), and miss several dips in the interim while losing value every day."
03/31/2021,stocks,There also individual days that are responsible for a huge chunk of a stock‚Äôs annual gains that are hard to predict. That alone is a good reason just to toss money in.
03/31/2021,stocks,"You have no idea when a pull back will happen, how much it will be and how long it will last. 

Let‚Äôs say you vow to wait until the market pulls back 10%. Ok, great. Except the market keeps going up. You wait. There‚Äôs a 5% pull back, an 8% pullback... here it comes!!! But no wait, the market rallies again. Maybe you should have bought, well, it‚Äôs okay, you‚Äôll just wait for that 10%. 

Even if that 10% dip comes‚Äîit may not‚Äîchances are it comes after the market has already risen to the degree where you‚Äôre buying in at a higher level than you would have if you had just invested.

03/31/2021,stocks,"The trouble is knowing when. The chances you will hit exactly the bottom, or the top are slim. It is possible, it‚Äôs just not likely. If it was easy, everyone would do it, and the old adages of trading were learned from loss porn we can scarcely comprehend. If you think you can, why not split the money, invest one as the old wise ones advise, and use the other half as you are describing? See which one yields long term."
03/31/2021,stocks,"""Explain why time in beats timing""

Because the arrow of time moves forward one day, every day.

Nobody can consistently time the market.

It's that simple; one you can do 100% of the time, the other you can do less than that, and the average success rate is below 50%.

""it would be safe to assume holding a large portion of cash and waiting for a pull back would be better than DCAing into SPY.""

It would not be safe to assume. That said, timing that ""a correction will happen in the next couple years"" is safer than ""this stock will go up this month."" But if you're at the start of a bull market, that correction will not bring it down to what it was at when you started waiting. So context is important. If you're fairly sure the market is currently in a bubble, or needs a correction, then you're right, you should wait. But don't assume you're right; continue to re-assess your judgement over time if it doesn't correct.

I would not be comfortable going into SPY right now, for example. I would rather wait, because I don't think it fully corrected. I think new money came in during a rotation, and only the recent increase from that new money corrected. I'm still anticipating a more systemic correction. But that is a controversial position; a good contrarian point would be that Harry Dent is predicting a crash, which implies a bull market.ü§£üëº"
03/31/2021,stocks,If you think you can time it great try that but majority of the time you will never buy at bottom and never sell at ath. Looking back it's easy to see a pattern but it rarely replays like you expect because the next year will start a new pattern that looks different when you view back again.
03/31/2021,stocks,"You'll learn that you receive alot if hypocrital advise here. People will stand around saying the market is over valued and in a bubble right now. Then turn around and tell you time in the market beats timing it. 

I think out of all the ones you could buy in right now, spy is a pretty safe option for market volatility. And people alot of times saying the time in idea becuse they keep investing and DCA over time. Lump sum investing doesn't work out as great if you buy at the peak and then never average it down."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Because with no experience, you can‚Äôt time anything at all. You might get lucky, but you won‚Äôt get that lucky."
03/31/2021,stocks,I timed facebook and I sold at 264.. it's 288 now
03/31/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs why you cannot ignore valuation.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I haven't read the other responses but I'll take a crack at explaining it.

While you're right that large corrections happen infrequently, smaller pullbacks are very frequent.  Look at all the times the SPY pulled back 5-10%.  When the markets first pull back, you have no idea at the time how big the pullback will be.  So you decide to sell on a 5% drop and then the markets rebound quickly and you miss the rebound.  

Pullbacks are only obvious in hindsight.  In real time it is impossible to time it accurately, and as a result you will miss the top and also miss the bottom.  And there is lots of research showing that missing out on the best days of the year (which often happen at market bottoms) will kill your annual returns."
03/31/2021,stocks,"But on the avg it goes up around 10% per year. Obviously last year was crazy. But not typically going to happen. 
So even if it's at some point later in the year. Spy would have to go up 10% from here just to be worth it. 

Also I'm adding monthly like you say. But I could be adding more. I'm just trying to get over my fear of buying all time high."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Thanks. This def helps. I never meant to pretend to time the bottom. Rather I'm actually itching to add more to my brokerage. Quite the opposite recently I've been hitting the peaks lol. 
But this info helps me get over the buying at all time highs a bit."
03/31/2021,stocks,I've seen this several times. And missing those days cripples returns. Thanks for reminder.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I by no means think I can time the bottom. I've bought every bottom of the Nas for the last month. Lol. But it's nice to buy as it declines because I'm getting a bargain. 
It's the buying at the peak that has me concerned. 

Currently I'm dca ing. But I have more I can add. Just waiting for a better time. Least in my mind."
03/31/2021,stocks,I enjoyed this response thank you. I was very sure this stimmy was priced in and was going to cause a correction. I was 33% correct. The Nas too I hit. Still think the spy is due as well. So I fight myself on the idea of time in vs timing. I keep DCAing for now.
03/31/2021,stocks,Thanks. I was just gathering opinions. I take it all with a grain of salt. Last year cathie woods could do no wrong in this sub. Not she's a charlatan. Lol. Not alot of long term people here atm.
03/31/2021,stocks,I understand that. But I'm not interested in selling. Rather I am interested in deploying the cash through the draw back. Not timing the biotin but buying weekly during the down turn.
03/31/2021,stocks,"the market will always be at an all time high. this is why investing works. the market, given enough time, will always go up

it's ultimately up to you what you want to do. the random yt vids and reddit comments have no say in your account. just do what makes you comfortable."
03/31/2021,stocks,"You're misinterpreting the average return. That average is only over very long time spans, it almost never gives the average return in a given year. Year to year it varies wildly, it could go up 25% this year again, then next year again, then crash 30% the next."
03/31/2021,stocks,I was considering DCAing into SPY and changed my mind and went lump sum. Long term it will increase over time so may as well get in now rather than stagger the returns. I got in after a small dip to 390 from 397.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Then there's no issue.  The ""time in the market"" philosophy is an argument against trying to time tops by selling and buying back in.  If you hold and add, you're following the philosophy."
03/31/2021,stocks,Just looking for opinion is all. Having money on the side allowed me to add to this drawdown. So i like  the thought of a decent cash position. But I also understand I can't time the top or bottom. So a little torn is all.
03/31/2021,stocks,I do understand that. And more so recently we haven't seen down years or bear markets. So my 8% is probably way off.
03/31/2021,stocks,Ok cool. Thanks.
03/31/2021,stocks,"if you know you can't time the top or bottom, what are you keeping the cash position for?"
03/31/2021,stocks,I bought all the way down during this nas correction. No need to time the bottom. I just keep buying while the sale continues.
03/31/2021,stocks,"And what about when the sale doesn‚Äôt continue, and prices go up? Then you‚Äôre missing the upside because you‚Äôre holding cash 

The point is: you don‚Äôt know. So go with the statistics: lump sum generally beats DCA. Most professional stock pickers don‚Äôt beat the market."
2021-03-31 06:03:19,stocks,"Can anyone explain to me why my day-trading ETF strategy is risky/unprofitable? Almost every resource I consult about day trading mentions that it is a zero sum game and that beginners should never get into it. 

What is wrong with my potential day-trading strategy?

Trade an ETF that will has value (ie will definitely go up in the long run). For example, VOO or QQQ. 

Everyday, I set the limit order to -1%, and sell when it rises to 1%. Thus, I make a \~2% profit. Given that a share of VOO is around $300, I make $6 dollars per share, every day, by clicking 2 buttons. 

If the ETF rises, let's say a 10% increase over a year, I still beat it, since I get 2% returns a day. 

If the ETF falls, I do not sell out. I just wait until the ETF recovers (because it will) and then resume my strategy. 

I don't see anything wrong with my strategy. There is nothing that sounds super risky and I make a decent return. I never lose, since I will never sell at a loss. However, it feels like I missing something, since if this basic method is so profitable then I don't understand why everyone is not doing it. Can a more experienced investor point to the flaws in my thinking?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"If it doesn't go down 1% then you're not in, and you miss out on all gains for the day. If it goes up 1% it could go up more, and you miss out on those gains. It could go down 1%, then go down more, but you're right if its something like SPY then its just a matter of how many days, weeks, or years until it goes back up. But you probably wouldn't beat the market this way only because you'd be in the market for less time than just holding, and there isn't any real reason why this would be profitable."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Your -1% limit won‚Äôt trigger every day. The days it doesn‚Äôt trigger are days you miss the elevator ride up. The days that it does, it might be the start of a slide and not recover for days/weeks. To think you can easily make 2% per day on this is a fantasy."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Obviously the stop limit seems like a smart thing until you do the opposite and it also seems smart.

You have a win limit and no loss limit"
03/31/2021,stocks,You aren't getting 2% a day because you hold when the price goes down. You'll end up buying at a higher price than if you had just held instead of selling most of the time. I don't think you'll beat the ETF like this. Essentially you're taking most the losses and very few of the gains.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Days VOO falls by 1% are rare, days VOO rises by 1% are rare. Days where VOO falls then rises by 1% are very rare."
03/31/2021,stocks,"This would make you exit the instant you are getting a good bull run and force you to hold through all downtrends.

What is theoretically the maximum gain trading is to sell before it goes DOWN and buy before it goes UP. This way, you are never holding a downtrend and every uptrend you get gains. You are doing the exact opposite, which is at any sign of nice gains you sell, and when things are looking bad, you hold it the whole way down forever.

This is somewhat related to the sunken cost fallacy, at least the part where you said you never sell at a loss so you can't lose. Say you bought $100,000 worth of a stock, and it crashed, and now you have $30,000 worth. This is an unrealized loss since you haven't sold. But if you need to hold that stock for 50 years for it to break even, you lost a massive amount of money because that $30,000 could have been somewhere else with way better returns.

This also ignores a lot of issues with tax, pattern day trading rules and commission."
03/31/2021,stocks,are you forgeting the ~ 25% youll have to pay to the tax man?
03/31/2021,stocks,You are grossly simplifying it. It doesn‚Äôt work like that.
03/31/2021,stocks,What‚Äôs your tax situation?
03/31/2021,stocks,"What you're thinking of is what high frequency traders do; they do it a bunch of times a day though. But you have to do it on much much smaller slices than 1%. And so, you'll need a really fancy expensive account, and lots of money. And then, it is still hard to make anything unless you're really awesome at complex statistics and programming."
03/31/2021,stocks,Go for it
03/31/2021,stocks,Do it!!
03/31/2021,stocks,"What is wrong is that you will never consistently do this every day, you might not even consistently do this every week. And ultimately you likely would make less money than just buying the damn ETF and sitting on it over the same period of time. 

Go pull a VOO chart and count the number of times it fell a full percent from open and recovered. it is rare. I scanned pretty quick but on a year chart I eyeball like, maybe 20 or so days this happened. your issues is if you are going to pick ""safe"" steady solid ETFs, they are exactly that. safe and steady. they are low volatility and they don't swing. people do not move money in and out of VOO and QQQ often. Look at the trading volume of VOO, it averages right around 3 million a day, that is pretty low honestly. When VOO goes down, it goes down fairly slowly over a few days then rebounds, again somewhat slowly, over time. on a day to day basis, it generally isn't big percent swings and those days it is, is more rare than days the movement is sub 1%. 

Just for comparison, Intel averages around 25 million (eyeballing the chart) apple is more like 80-100 million. pick most blue chips, they trade in the 10s of millions a day. This big ETFs do not do that because they are long term investment vehicles."
03/31/2021,stocks,What do you mean by the opposite? If the price doesn't hit the threshold I just don't sell
03/31/2021,stocks,What if he did it in a Roth

03/31/2021,stocks,Do nothing. Averaging down to 128 from 133 is not even that big of a deal for an IRA when your horizons are 20-30 years.

For example if you are young, why do you even have any BND? 

No one REALY knows what's going to happen...At the end of the day you're just going to have to roll the dice and make these decisions on your own and learn.

As for ARK I'm invested in them too, I'd just hold. If you want to sell BND, put it into VTI or VGT."
03/31/2021,stocks,"ARKK is actively managed so it‚Äôs not a huge deal to have 30% in your fund.  It‚Äôs up to you whether or not you believe in disruptive tech over the next 5-10years. I‚Äôm a huge believer in everything (with the exception of Tesla oddly enough). 

Your add line is $110/sh. You can check the hourly chart from the last month and see that as a clear line of support. Over $133 and it regains its uptrend again. In between it‚Äôs just kind of bouncing around. 
Hold what you have, add a share or so at $110-$115 if it gets there again.. if you don‚Äôt like how much you‚Äôre holding on a percentage basis, trim some when it goes to $140 or so (and it will)."
03/31/2021,stocks,Nothing wrong with averaging down if you believe in it over the long run. You bought it for a reason.
03/31/2021,stocks,"If u like the stock then you would be happy when it dips because that means it's cheaper. 

So figure out how much conviction u have in ur ark funds and go based on that. 32% IMO is a tad high for ark but if your time horizon is long like 15 years it's not the biggest deal in the world. But if u still feel uneasy about staying in the red you can always change it.

Stick to ur plan and DCA it in the long run."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I agree with what other said.. If I were in your shoes, Don't sell anything.. And in the future contributions, focus on VTI to shrink the % of your portfolio exposed to ARK.

Others are higher risk but I still think are undervalued - Prudential, CI Financial. I see Aflac, and other insurance/reinsurance as good values, it‚Äôs just a sector I don‚Äôt invest in.

I'll admit, I'm a pessimistic person by default. I also can become insanely optimistic to the point that my family would like to get me a room at the local hospital. As we all know the stock market is a game of emotions. I think we mistakenly believe that selling for a loss is a form of weakness or defeat. Or we might fear we can't live with ourselves if it goes up again without us owning it. I see new traders that get down double digit percentage points and start calculating how many months they will have to hold to get their money back. 

When my trade starts going sour I decide to cut my losses and move on. Sometimes I regret it and sometimes I'm really happy I did.

A few things to remember.


1. ""Honest"" DD on a speculative company is extremely hard to come by. Usually you only see what they want you to see until the earnings report comes out. Just because your DD tells you hold forever doesn't mean it'll work out. Even if you read the whole internet.


2. Even a great company can be purchased at the wrong time. Wait for a pull back. Be patient. Even as Amazon hits all time highs you still should wait for an entry point. It's not that you'll ""lose money"" over the long term, it's just that you can get stuck trading sideways for months. If you buy high you can get stuck in the red for months. Watch the RSI (relative strength index) for a value in the 30s or 40s before jumping in at least. 


3. Dollar cost averaging isn't just a fad. It makes a ton of sense. Buy half of your position so that you can buy another half later if the stock drops significantly (relative to you) below your purchase price. If it doesn't dip further then good for you. Buy your other half on a pullback above your cost basis or be content with the half position.


4. Always have an exit strategy when you purchase the stock. Even if your exit strategy is ""hold it until I retire."" Don't purchase a stock without an exit strategy. That exit strategy should include a maximum loss amount along with a potential gains amount. Stick a stop loss (or have a dca price target) at your max loss. Once the stock gets above your gain goal stick a stop loss at that level. Let it keep running if it will or sell if it doesn't. Minimizing losses is more important than people give it credit for in this sub. 


5. Did the reason that you purchased the stock change? If so, SELL IT. If you bought the stock because you believed something would happen and it doesn't, sell it. Whether it's a loss, or gain, or break even. Your emotions will get the best of you if the reason for buying the stock is no longer valid. You won't be able to hold through the dips or recognize if you should take profits when you should. 


6. Diversification. It's easier to hold red when you have green along side of it. Buy stocks in other sectors. As we've all seen first hand this year, money moves around more than it comes out of the market. Rebalance your portfolio from time to time. Choose a sector you don't have money in and find a stock you like. Or choose an ETF.


7. Easy money gained is easy money loss. The quicker your stock moved up the quicker your stock can go down. Don't be scared to take profits! You will NEVER time the top right. 


8. You can't win them all. Self explanatory. 


Even with all that in mind, luck is involved. Nobody knows what will happen with any given stock so expect the unexpected. Having money stuck on a trade moving sideways for 12 months is worse than taking the loss and putting it elsewhere in my opinion. 

I started this post with intentions of a quick reminder that it's ok to sell for a loss sometimes and it became some sort of ""tips"" to remember post from another amateur trader on the internet. Hopefully something was of value to you if you made it this far. If not, my sincere apologies to you Mr. Warren Buffett!"
03/31/2021,stocks,"The difference between buying the dip and riding a losing horse is whether or not the company has the makeup to bounce back. Periods of pullback and reconciliation like this are the perfect time to sort out which is which in your portfolio. 

We were all geniuses in the bull market when every last piece of crap stuck to the wall, but things are sorting themselves out now. If it‚Äôs a loser, rotate out of it in order to buy dips in the winners that are getting beat up unfairly. 

These are the losses everyone should be willing to realize."
03/31/2021,stocks,I sell in the red when I feel my opportunity cost elsewhere is better.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I sold my BB when it dropped 25% and took my losses and rotated into stocks that made me my money back within a week. If I decided to hold I would be down closer to a 50% loss with less of an opportunity to see recovery from my initial investment. 


Learn when to walk away. It‚Äôs okay to admit you were on the wrong side of the trade sometimes."
03/31/2021,stocks,"""Its not a loss if you dont sell"" isn't always true. Holding a loser in hopes it goes up prevents you from chasing opportunities that may be a better bet. Sure some stocks have ups and downs and its better to hold. Others are a done deal and its time to move on."
03/31/2021,stocks,Never forget - these sell offs present a good opportunity for loss harvesting. If you can rotate into something similar consider it.
03/31/2021,stocks,"It's also reasonable to sell a falling stock that you bought too high and rebuy it lower.  Depending on the volatility and size of the drop it can be more advantageous than averaging down, and more practical if you are short on funds."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Mainstream advice talks out both sides of its mouth on this.

First they say don't try to time the market. Then they say if it goes down 8% to sell it.

First they say that trading too often is bad and reduces performance; then they say if you make a mistake, trade more often by selling right away!

What I do, is I try to extract consistent truth from these things, and come up with a consistent system. Now, of course, if it goes down and I think the company is going to go out of business, I sell. Last year I sold Nikola and Kandi for a loss, because I couldn't tell if they were even legit or not. But everything else that went down, I waited. \[redacted\] went down almost 20% on me, and that was one of my biggest winners last year!

So my take is this: The only timing I care about is selling high. If it is up and I sell, I made money, that has to be good. If I'm wrong about a pick, and it goes down, I don't try to time it; I don't assume my next pick will be any better! I take the ""loss"" in the time column by waiting. And therefore, the more mistakes I make, the less often I'm trading! That's way better than increasing your trade rate when you're screwing up. If everything I have is down, I'm not trading, I'm waiting, waiting. That's as it should be. If I'm making great picks and they're going up right after I buy them, then I'm selling right away, and trading more often! That's also as it should be.

If you follow all the advice, you'll lose all your money, because the advice is all hand-wavy BS. You have to choose a system that works for you.üë©‚Äçüéìüëº"

03/31/2021,stocks,"Agree with your points, and it's nice to finally have a post on this subject that goes against the common belief here.

Daniel Kahneman wrote an amazing book 'Thinking Fast and Slow', with a section all about 'loss aversion'. Basically, avoiding losses is weighted more important than an equivalent amount of gain. This is especially noticeable among investors and causes us to make irrational choices.

If your position is in the red, whether it will one day break even is not the right question to ask. The only thing that matters is the same questions you would ask before buying it in the first place:

* Is the company undervalued and/or is it cheaper than companies on your watchlist?
* Will it grow earnings (and thus its valuation) faster than the other companies on your watchlist?

Most of the stocks that are down heavily were ridiculously overvalued, and still are. There's no reason to think they will snap right back to their previous highs, and so it may not make sense to hold them for 2 years just to avoid selling at a loss.

If you don't trust the stock enough to put all of your bet into it at once, then when it drops it's justifying your fear, but then instead of closing your position and finding something else, you just double down on the amount of money you put into it, hoping that the law of averages will move it back to the original price, and pay back more than you lost already.

The negative side of that strategy is if it goes up you've only got half your money in it and you're only making half the profit that you intended to make by investing in it. Which means that you're losing no matter which direction it starts.

There's nothing wrong with just making your whole bet, and then if it drops putting more money in if your DD is still valid and the only thing that changed is the price. The mistake is considering that to be part of your strategy from the beginning."

OP is one of those guys who sold out a great company like Amazon at $3,000 because it hasn't moved for the past 9 months. Nothing has changed about the company's fundamentals but you sold to buy another stock because of ""opportunity costs,"" hoping to re-enter at a lower price on some other time. Who knows if the new trade is even a good idea. Then at some point the ""reflation trade"" stops working, people want Amazon stock again. As you watch the stock keeps moving higher, eventually you couldn't help yourself and hop back in when it goes to $4,000, buying at new ATH.

And that's why you're forever a paper hander. It's fine to admit if you just want to trade and not to invest. But don't preach about selling at loss for the wrong reasons when you don't know what being an **investor** actually means."
03/31/2021,stocks,The only reason I‚Äôd sell for a loss is because I was flat out wrong about whatever position I took. Any other reason is giving money away. And when I mean wrong I don‚Äôt mean I bought AMC thinking it was gonna go up 50% tomorrow and it went down 30% and now suddenly Im gonna worry about the opportunity cost like I wasn‚Äôt just trading aka gambling

03/31/2021,stocks,"> Mainstream advice talks out both sides of its mouth on this.

This is very true. Almost every single bit of advice anybody gives, has equally compelling counter arguments. It's the nature of the game. If there was a way to do it perfectly, people would have discovered it by now, and they'd be exploiting it constantly.

The key is to find some type of system that works for you, and then stick with it. You need to have conviction in your entry point, and know ahead of time, which price you sell at (taking profits) and what price you need to dump the stock and take a L. You need to know these numbers in advance and don't waver on them, unless there's ""real"", legit, new information about the company that could change the landscape"

This vague view doesn‚Äôt make a great case for the wisdom of the small traders, rather is a reminder of the problem:
They tend to buy based on emotion and peer pressure, when they see an uptrend and hear a nice story and positive noise. So when it starts going down regularly and the excitement fades, the reasons they believed it would go up are largely negated.

Shit Tesla is established enough to stick around as a brand, but I think a huge profit center for them is going to disappear soon when other companies no longer buy credits from them because they‚Äôre making their own EVs. Combine that with a more competitive market that they don‚Äôt get to name their price anymore, and the outlook isn‚Äôt great for Tesla either as far as share price. 

I think at this point in the ev game it‚Äôs foolish to bet on any company that isn‚Äôt already established as an auto mfg with a long history of making cars.

Ev startups are about 5 years too little too late.

I guess I don‚Äôt see a metoo EV company that wants to sell a model S as bringing something new to the table to justify the insane valuation that it has. I think there‚Äôs money to be made in EVs, but it‚Äôs gonna be on the software and AI end, not on a company like Lucid. 

Apple or Google or Microsoft or Amazon announces they‚Äôre in partnership with Toyota to build self driving EVs? Shut up and take my money. 

Until then, buying lucid is nothing more than a super high risk gamble with a low chance of returns at this point.

03/31/2021,stocks,"NMTR has been a dog for me the past few months but I'm going to hold. The stock I wish I bought more of when I bought NMTR was ACST.  But long term I think NMTR is the better hold. 

FREQ is interesting because it dropped like 80% in one day because of bad news. I have to believe it will bounce back. If I had some fuck off money, I'd buy a 100 shares and see what happens."
03/31/2021,stocks,"NMTR is gonna do well long term. They have two drugs performing very well in FDA testing. Their celiac drug is going to be a game changer. The fact is there is no competition on the market for it. Larazotide is going to change lives for people with serious gluten allergies. Their SBS drug is going to get approval more than likely by EOY. Covid pushed back their trials which is why the price has gone down as they were expected to be getting approval this year but likely may be pushed back to early next year. I‚Äôm in at 2,000 shares @0.59."
03/31/2021,stocks,"FREQ bombed after bad phase 2 results. In phase 1 they saw what looked like decent results with a single dose, but saw no significant change with 4 doses in phase 2. However, there‚Äôs still some hope that they can manage something with the single dose approach. I was bay holding at $40 and decided to average down to $15 because it seems like there‚Äôs still a possibility something comes from this. They also noted that there may have been some flaws with study design that confounded their results."
03/31/2021,stocks,Pump and dump?  Placed limit orders -20% current price to see what happens.  Think both companies have potential.
03/31/2021,stocks,Long on NMTR. Currently selling multiple $1 and $1.5 puts for May 21st. Idk about you but I enjoy getting paid to purchase stocks.
03/31/2021,stocks,"The crazy offloading in recent weeks has left investors stuck. Sell and solidify losses, or hold and buy at these low prices are the options. I was following stocktwits and they thought NMTR was headed to $3 when the bad news hit and investors dumped a container ship load of shares back on the exchange. NMTR was around $1.27 today, then rebounded. FREQ was at $7.70 then 8.40."
03/31/2021,stocks,Oof.
2021-03-31 05:05:54,stocks,"$CBD files Form 6-K for share capital increase, but no change in number of shares? Looking for wiser folks than I to help me understand the impact of this move. 

Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao ($CBD) has filed Form 6-K with the SEC. They are seeking a shareholder vote on the approval of a share capital increase in the amount of R$ 200.000.000,00 (approx. 35 mil US$) through the capitalization of part of the Expansion Reserve account, **without the issuance of new shares**, passing the capital from R$ 5,649,866,585.69 to R$ 5,849,866,585.69, **with no change in the number of shares.** 

I understood that standard practice when raising capital is to issue new shares, thereby diluting the overall share poll and likely lowering their value. However, here they appear to be drawing funds from a reserve account to directly increase their capitalization. If there are no new shares, would this have any impact on the shares I currently hold? 

I have 100 shares @ $4.47. Thanks.

2021-03-31 05:03:59,stocks,"Buy 3 shares GOOG. Am I nuts? Is it nuts to put 5% of my portfolio in GOOG?  Or should I just get 1 share and wait for a possible pullback ... That may not come?

I already have 19% across AAPL and MSFT with approx. 11.5% AAPL and 8% MSFT.  

I know you're ""not supposed to sell AAPL "" (Cramer üòÜ)...  but should I sell some AAPL to put in GOOG?  Or just buy GOOG?

I have enough cash for 4 shares, but I'd rather not overweight GOOG.

My reasoning for GOOG is the obvious I suppose plus it's supposedly part of the re-opening (whatever that really means lol).

Or should I just do some partial shares of GOOG?  Do you see it going down at all?

If I add GOOG though my tech weighting will be up around 65% I think.

I really don't wanna get rid of MSFT or too much AAPL.  I'm cost basis 90 @50 shares AAPL and 20 shares @ 202 on MSFT.



Thoughts?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"GOOGL has been battle tested on the recent pull back and defended itself pretty well vs other tech stocks. Agree with the other poster, DCA into the position to play it safe in the event we see a more severe correction. But overall great long term hold so would not be concerned on weight. But then again, I prefer growth/tech stocks as my core but willing to stomach the eb and flow it comes with."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Alphabet along with Microsoft have been the most resilient throughout this tech bloodfest so it ain‚Äôt a bad pick and is actually set to break out again soon I believe . I would however go with googl instead of goog, if I‚Äôm investing in a company i would like to at least have voting rights even if my vote is pointless."
03/31/2021,stocks,"If you want 3 shares of GOOG, DCA 1 share over the next 3 months to see where it gets ya!"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Google is a great company don‚Äôt listen to a bunch a Reddit luddites try to explain google‚Äôs business lines. 

They‚Äôll be in genomics as they will be the computing power for the labs running genetic sequencing.

Google owns waymo another forward looking concept.

Ad money will always be around, no one comes close to their market share.

It‚Äôs basically a VC firm dressed as a blue chip."
03/31/2021,stocks,I personally think Google is one of the safer individual names to own
03/31/2021,stocks,Great company
03/31/2021,stocks,What are you non tech stocks?
03/31/2021,stocks,"That‚Äôs a very good AAPL position. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, but it seems worth holding."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Of the three there, goog has better projections than the other two."
03/31/2021,stocks,imagine being able to sell weekly covered calls  of this
03/31/2021,stocks,You can also find an ETF where GOOG is involved.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Putting 5% of your portfolio into one of the largest, most used, and best run companies in the world? Might sound crazy to the chimps over at WSB but to the rest of us that doesn't sound *nuts* at all."

03/31/2021,stocks,"Don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs basically cash. Google‚Äôs growth is very slow. Buy Apple. Apple have plans to expand into many sectors such as smart glass, electric vehicle. Its service portfolio has been generating increasing revenue. If there is one big tech you need to own, it‚Äôs Apple."
03/31/2021,stocks,Sell cash covered puts. You get to buy the dip if the price goes down but also profit if the price goes up
03/31/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/31/2021,stocks,Got an aneurysm from reading this. This reads like a 13 yr old wrote it.
03/31/2021,stocks,Meh there‚Äôs better out there then GOOG.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I just looked at the google chart and it's ugly. It's getting pinched in a triangle. In less than 2 weeks it will likely have a big breakout. Can't tell you if it will be up or down but once it does that it's likely going to make a big move. So you have 2 weeks to think about it. If it goes up hop on if it goes down let it crash.

That's my unprofessional technical analysis we'll see what happens."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Thanks!  Maybe I'll just do 1 share right now.  I'm long term so I should be ok?

I also added FB recently and am up about 9% I think.  It's about 2.5% f portfolio I think."
03/31/2021,stocks,Googl is better?  Ok
03/31/2021,stocks,what does DCA mean?
03/31/2021,stocks,"This is the answer right here.

Edit: Also, @OP, having 5% in GOOG is not crazy, but having 65% tech-weighted IS, imo."
03/31/2021,stocks,Are you being funny or serious?  Sorry can't tell.  Should I cut down on some other tech. So that I'm not so heavy tech?  About 65% if I add GOOG.
03/31/2021,stocks,Better bet than AAPL MSFT?
03/31/2021,stocks,Should check out the amount of companies google has bought over the past 1 year or 10 years. They buy and own more than you know. It‚Äôs like Coca Cola but if they did more than food.
03/31/2021,stocks,"UNH TMO total market,  DG WMT UNP JPM HD"
03/31/2021,stocks,Yes thanks.  I plan on keeping it for at least 5 years.  When do I trim it though?
03/31/2021,stocks,Yeah.  I don't get all that.  I just buy and try an hold for 10 years.
03/31/2021,stocks,"You need $200k to hold the shares required to sell covered calls of GOOG or GOOGL... I think some people on here have that, but most don't."
03/31/2021,stocks,"That's true.  May be a good idea.  QQQ or something.  I just like seeing my basis go down on individual names, but etf is less risky true!"
03/31/2021,stocks,Yeah but I'm already 20% in msft aapl.  Add to that nvda fb SQ pypl etc!  Yikes!!  Joking!  But I'm bout 60% tech if you include my ASML LRCX AVGO TSM
03/31/2021,stocks,What's that?  I'll look into it.
03/31/2021,stocks,Ahahaaa
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yeah I sort of feel the same though bout AAPL lately though  lol!  I'm in with 50 shares @ 90.

I also have fb msft and nvda ASML LRCX AVGO also.  How am I looking?  I also have non tech like UNH HD TMO UNP etc."
03/31/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/31/2021,stocks,Thanks.  I don't get options.
03/31/2021,stocks,Thanks.

03/31/2021,stocks,"If you wanted to be more conservative, and your broker allows fractional shares, buy 1/2 share to start. Wait a week or two and pick up the other 1/2 share. We're at the end of quarter close so tech rotation may be over for some plays, GOOGL will hold up well IMO and should not be a stock to worry if it pulls back after you buy. If this happens, this is where DCA is your friend."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I mean they‚Äôre both the same company lol so it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre investing in some other company.

It‚Äôs just class c has no voting right while class A does, now obviously it won‚Äôt mean much to us small fry bc we‚Äôll never own enough votes to matter however i approach the situation from a value stand point and strictly speaking one class of share gives me more rights as a holder and as a holder why wouldn‚Äôt i want that?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"It‚Äôs: dollar cost averaging. It simple terms, it‚Äôs when you invest your money over a period of time to protect yourself from volatility in big purchases. In OPs case, it might not be best to buy all three shares at once. So, utilizing a DCA approach OP can get into the stock at different prices rather than one lump sum transaction"
03/31/2021,stocks,Just depends on your risk tolerance. Your cost basis for Apple seems reasonable. It‚Äôs just that tech has gotten beaten up recently since it ran up so highly during this past year and is now starting to pull back. It‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúall of your eggs in one basket‚Äù scenarios. Diversification is always good but I like tech stocks myself.
03/31/2021,stocks,I‚Äôm very serious! Apologies for the confusion. Tech stocks are great. The future is highly uncertain with rates rising as well as a potential tax increase. If you are in it for the long haul you should be all set.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Splitting hairs those 3 represent such a large portion of the market they rise and fall together all 3 have strong financials.

03/31/2021,stocks,Then you don‚Äôt understand their success at all. Their user retention is probably near 100% in the sense that once you go Apple you never go back.
03/31/2021,stocks,Personally I would take advantage of the sell off in growth tech. GOOG just seems like settling. There‚Äôs better in non tech too.
03/31/2021,stocks,Fidelity.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yeah thanks.  I also have UNH HD WMT DG UNP FSKAX etc.  Just don't have as much weight that I do in tech and semis.

I'm in CRWD at 125 with only 6 shares, but kind of want to hold just for the heck.  Also have 12 SQ @ 185 basis.  Unfortunately I bought a few SQ high at 260 or something and. It brought my basis up.  Thinking of dumping those if it hits 260 again and buying back in at 210 or something.  Have to time it right twice though lol."
03/31/2021,stocks,Yup in for at least 15 to 20 years!  Unless I die before retirement lol.
03/31/2021,stocks,Thanks.

03/31/2021,stocks,True.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yeah maybe.  I think I have enough tech diversity really.

Not that I would, but I think Munger said you only need 5 good stocks."

2021-03-31 04:51:07,stocks,"Looking for cheaper versions of VTI or VOO I am adding about $150 a month to an investment account. I Would like about 50% of this account to be in maket tracking ETFs like VTI or VOO, but both of these ETFs are over $200 right now. I would rather not wait 2-3 months at a time to make a purchase, so I am hoping to find similar ETFs that are currently trading in the $50-150 range

I am wondering if anyone here likes any passively managed whole market or S&P tracking ETFs like VTI and VOO that are currently trading between $50 and $150?

Edit: Typo changed over $300 to over $200"
03/31/2021,stocks,FZROX
03/31/2021,stocks,Buy fractional shares
03/31/2021,stocks,You could look at the SCH series of ETFs from Schwab. They‚Äôre mostly under $100 per share. Or mutual funds. Depending on your broker you could by partial shares. On Schwab mutual funds are purchased by dollar amount rather than # of shares.
03/31/2021,stocks,Ummm vti is $200
03/31/2021,stocks,I wish VTI was trading over $300. I'd be a very happy guy
03/31/2021,stocks,SPLG
03/31/2021,stocks,ITOT
03/31/2021,stocks,Just buy fractional shares of it easy
03/31/2021,stocks,Most any major brokerage offers fractional shares. Price of a stock/ETF is totally irrelevant.
03/31/2021,stocks,You could check MILN as another alternative. $40 a share now.
03/31/2021,stocks,Look into Sector ETFs. XLI is a good one under $100
03/31/2021,stocks,"If you can‚Äôt buy fractional shares, look at SCHX and SCHB. I personally have SCHX since it‚Äôs pretty similar to VOO. SCHB is closer to VTI"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Curious, how many units and average cost??
I would be so delighted if I can get up 10k units!"
03/31/2021,stocks,SPLG is hands down the best SP500 ETF for everything except day trading
03/31/2021,stocks,"Perfect, thanks!"
03/31/2021,stocks,I recently moved my old company 401k into fidelity and rather than tinkering with it I just put most of it in VTI. So my average cost was $198 and it was just shy of 800 shares.
03/31/2021,stocks,why isn't it good for day trading?
03/31/2021,stocks,"Nice. I'm similar to you, 201 but about 150 shares."
03/31/2021,stocks,Spy is better for daytrading because it is more liquid. SPLG is better for holding because it has lower fees.
03/31/2021,stocks,10k shares is the dream lol
03/31/2021,stocks,Yes :)
2021-03-31 04:48:59,stocks,"Aphria - Tilray Deal Hi Guys, I wanted to clarify something about this Deal.

Aphria Shareholders receive 0.8381 of Tilray Shares for each Share of Aphria owned.

So, in my situation, I own 32 Aphria Shares X 0.8381 = 26.8192

Does this mean I will get 26 Full Shares of Tilray and 0.8192 in Warrents, Paid Out in Cash or Something Else?

I don't have to much experience with this... I have only lived through one other merger deal between Husky and Cenovus, they did Full Shares and Warrents.

Thanks"
03/31/2021,stocks,It's .838 of the price of Tilray share at time of merger.
03/31/2021,stocks,What if you have a apha 4/23 call what happens with that?
03/31/2021,stocks,The real question is will the merger make TLRY go up or down
03/31/2021,stocks,I‚Äôll add to this I was wondering if there is a cut off like if u don‚Äôt own aphria before whatever date do u not get the tilray  ashares or is it just wen the merge happens if u hold the shares ur good
03/31/2021,stocks,"Somebody help me out here I‚Äôve been trying to calculate this but people can‚Äôt seem to give a straight example.....
5 APHA shares @26. I should be buying more pre-merge to average down and get to below .83xTLRY price?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Tilray is *NOT* awarding partial shares.

You will lose that 0.8192 shares of APHA in the merger. You‚Äôll need to average up so your until your Tilray shares post merger are a whole number."
03/31/2021,stocks,When they‚Äôre merging?
03/31/2021,stocks,Yeah I‚Äôm buying to try and get as close to xx.1 share post split as possible
03/31/2021,stocks,Math hard.
03/31/2021,stocks,"it's 83% of Tilray share price.

Say Tilray is $100 at merger for easy math.

Even if Alphria is $1, $5, $40 ect.. your Alphria share would become $83.81 per share at merger."
03/31/2021,stocks,You drop down from owning 100 shares to about 83 shares.
03/31/2021,stocks,"If you are able to purchase the shares you're good. The day of, they will disable trading for both stocks and the next day you will have the appropriate amount of new stock/cash."
03/31/2021,stocks,"If you have 5 apha shares, the 0.8381 multiplier means you'll receive 4 tilray shares.

The value of each share, what you paid, does not matter.  It's a simple ratio of 1 to 0.8381,  no fractional shares.

To make money on the exchange, you would ideally have purchased your apha shares at less than 0.8381 x tilray share price at time of merger.

So using todays value of 22.04x0.8381, is 18.47.  So ideally you'd pay less than 18.47 for your apha shares and pick up an couple cents on the merger per share."
03/31/2021,stocks,"say after merger. all my APHA shares are worth 100.21 TILRAY shares.

They'll give me 100 Tilray shares and 0.21 will be returned to me in cash form, correct?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Will get the partial shares worth of cash, no need to do anything"
03/31/2021,stocks,4/20 or around there.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I don't know, when do you think it'll happen?"
03/31/2021,stocks,I'm pretty sure the document said each share becomes 0.8381 shares. You're trading value for position.
03/31/2021,stocks,83 shares of tilray tho? So a 17 call could be beneficial or no?
03/31/2021,stocks,Wait so calls are fucced is wat u saying ??
03/31/2021,stocks,"Ah, I am fucked. Thx :)"
03/31/2021,stocks,Si
03/31/2021,stocks,Gee they didn't plan that date did they lol
03/31/2021,stocks,"Oh ok, I don‚Äôt have a lot of APHA shares, I need to get more before then."
03/31/2021,stocks,"same thing.

Say you own 1000 Alphria at $20. Thats $20,000 invested.

At merger that becomes 838 shares of Tilray. If Tilray trades at 30 for example:

838 x 30= $25140.

&#x200B;

As long as Alphria is 17% below the value of Tilray you will profit."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yes, your best bet for solid profit is to own APHA shares or options below $20 or below. Either sell the news or hold after merger but you should see a jump in price and some good profit after the merger."
03/31/2021,stocks,No I am saying calls are the way to go.
03/31/2021,stocks,„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ
03/31/2021,stocks,I'm sure it was completely coincidental...
03/31/2021,stocks,Same I was using them as a store of value to buy OTCs
03/31/2021,stocks,"I should've said trading value for control. After the merger, you'll own less of the company, albeit at a higher value (hopefully). 

I went back and confirmed that the merger agreement did state they were exchanging shares."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Nice that‚Äôs what I assumed but had to double check, that‚Äôs why I bought the 17 call for 4/23 when it dipped to 16s"
03/31/2021,stocks,I have a 4/30 18.50C. Here's hoping!
2021-03-31 04:47:28,stocks,"my portfolio, am I doing it correctly? 24 Y/O Hey lads,

all are dripped back into their stocks. currently using a TFSA to trade. (NOT day trading)

for a grand total of $16,523.44 invested. I'm currently 'up' $465.99 CAD

I also recently started investing with gopeer (p2p lending)

I also have just over $5,000 invested in the company I work for.

I also have approx. $3,800 in a different TFSA / RRSP

Most of the stocks are paying dividends aside from a hand full that do not.

&#x200B;

Questions:

In your opinion, do I have a decently diversified my portfolio?

Are my dividend yields pretty decent for being 24 years old?

I'm Canadian and much prefer investing in the Canadian economy, I've also heard investing in American stocks take 15% of any capital gains / dividends?

IS p2p lending a decent way to make a few extra dollars?

if not please send me some suggestions."
03/31/2021,stocks,"You missed the M in AC. Jk. Looks good, dividend stocks make me happy"
03/31/2021,stocks,"One small note.  When you have larger positions, or higher dividend stocks consider -not- using DRIP on those specifically.  I do a decent position of a very high-dividend stock.  When I DRIP, that buys a large chunk at a time at Market.  I‚Äôm happy to buy Limit within the next few days but grab shares at a decent chunk less.  Now, where it isn‚Äôt that and I‚Äôm happy to accumulate partial shares...  DRIP is on."
03/31/2021,stocks,If ur using gopeer for p2p I would stop lol.
03/31/2021,stocks,Do you have a strong suggestion that is trusted? I'm very very new to it lol
03/31/2021,stocks,P2P is inherently risky so no suggestions from me.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Fair point, aside from stocks, what else would you invest in? :)"
2021-03-31 04:46:33,stocks,How to figure out FDA approves I see all these stocks that go up 50% because they get an approved FDA trial and was just wondering what the best resources were to research these stocks before they get information. I know that getting the results before hand is a no no bur is there places where you can get up to date research on what stocks are close to disclosing what is happening with their drug. I haven't been trading long so any help is good.
03/31/2021,stocks,"You need to know a lot about the industry and the specifics about the drug. You need to be able to digest the clinical trials and scrutinize the materials/methods and endpoints of the clinical trials and THEN figure out if something up for FDA approval will be clinically significant to be approved, which is really difficult. For example, there was a trial for a NASH drug from Intercept/ICPT that showed histological improvement in liver fibrosis BUT it was not determined that it had clinical benefit to be approved at the time of the trial end point (REGENERATE is the trial name). You gotta be able to understand stuff like that to have any sense of if something will be approved. I work in healthcare, I do spend a decent amount of time digesting these kinds of things for investing purposes and I still don't get it. It's not impossible but it requires a certain amount of insight, whether it's drug approval or a product launch or service being successful in any other industry.

2021-03-31 04:22:31,stocks,"Are premium research services worth it? I'm gonna be perfectly honest, over the last year I've made some decent gains but I wouldn't exactly say it was because of skill or due diligence there's just been crazy upward movement in almost all stocks (discounting the last few weeks of course). Now that the pickings aren't as easy and the market is getting back to a place of being flat/volatile I want to step my game up a bit. I've already purchased some books and found some youtubers I like but my question is this; Are professional research services like Motley fool stock adviser, Tip ranks premium, Zacks premium etc... worth it? Do they actually provide meaningful investing insights that would be hard to get on your own or are they just a money grabbing trap for new folks. If so which ones do you guys feel are the best. 

TLDR- Are premium research services like Zacks, motley fool or tip ranks worth the money or are they trash."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I subscribed to Motley Fool's SA and RB. I'm not paid by them and have nothing to do with them, except that I'm a relatively new customer.Cons:- when you subscribe, you have to explain to everyone who knows them that you are NOT paying for their crappy junk free articles; in my eyes, they are hurting their business so much by producing this free garbage- many (but not all) recommended stocks seem like obvious picks (such as, buy Amazon)- they start selling you on MORE services for even CRAZIER returns, and they use outdated, annoying, pathetic marketing. (Motley people, if you are reading this, you really REALLY need a new marketing team. The crap you put out now is embarrassing. ""ONLY TODAY you can click here for our 100009990000% returning stock advice for only 1800 dollars but discounted to 1300..."" Cringe-worthy.)

Pros:- DDs on premium (paid) services are all decent; there are pros, cons for a stock; everything you need to know in a short readable article- I have never heard about some of the recommended stocks that seem to be good stocks (I'm a newish subscriber, so I don't know what happens in 3-5 years, which they recommend for holding)- It makes you buy the stock that you KNEW was a good stock, but for some reason didn't buy before because it is too obvious - for example, they tell you: ""we think that these 5 stocks are a good buying opportunity now"" - and then I finally DO buy a stock like Amazon or Paypal (which I believed to be good stocks anyway). This is more psychological/behavioral, but for some stocks I need the nudge to actually buy them.

\- I have fun waiting for new stock recommendations every week, and I make it a goal to save for and buy one of the recommended stock each time, so I invest every week.  


PS. Edit to add: I did read MANY books and took university courses. However, I use this for more concrete suggestions than what I have learnt through theories of investing. I also am too lazy to go through hundreds of stocks and do the analysis. I have a job already."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Check their track record.

I don't recommend using any source of research at all but what you can do yourself, because everybody is full of it. Nobody is your friend.

But a premium service with a good history, you can just compare their results to your own and know what you're getting.

A youtube channel, you don't know what you're getting, and they can delete videos that were duds. They're not going to have the time in the market that the premium services have, either. You're better off rolling dice than trading on free stock picks, and this sort of ""research"" isn't really research; it is a just a pick that is being marketed to you.

2021-03-31 04:18:00,stocks,"Thoughts on FUTU, a Chinese online trading platform I've been following FUTU for a while, and its really starting to pique my curiousity. It showed up on my radar in January after I saw it go from $40 to $70 in 2 weeks. That's pennystock kind of movement and it scared me to get in as I wanted to wait for some consolidation. Well, consolidation never came and it rocketed to a peak of $191 before pulling back in the February-fuck-fest that all growth stocks hit.

FUTU's history is interested as it was only listed on NASDAQ on March 2019.

FUTU offers brokerage service provider and is transforming into an all-rounded online financial services platform integrating trading, wealth management, market data and information, social collaboration and corporate services.

The CEO of FUTU was the 18th employee of Tencent.

The shareholder letter is really good:
https://ir.futuholdings.com/static-files/987fd24a-8db0-4126-b267-9a03f397f968

*Sidenote: why the fuck US interest rates would affect a Chinese trading platform, I'll never understand....*

So I started to look into this company. First off, they're expensive. Their PE is 107 with a PS of 40. If you valuations don't mean anything to you, then you haven't learned anything from February's pullback. But their growth may quickly drive down their PE and PS. They are expanding globally, outside of China and Hong Kong. 

They posted earnings on March 26:
https://ir.futuholdings.com/financial-information/annual-reports

Ironically, their earnings were great, but their stock still tanked. I have a suspicion they tanked 15% because of Archegos fuckery more than anything else. But I can't prove this. Chinese stocks as a whole got decimated on March 26.

Their YoY revenue growth was 281% with YoY triple digit growth for 4 consecutive quarters. Revenues were up 211% YoY. With trading platforms, the number of users matters a lot, and their users grew 60% YoY.

They posted a USD$170M profits on USD$427M of revenues, which gives them a net margin of 40%. Their gross margin is closer to 75%, which is very impressive. Their revenues have grown almost 3x YoY since 2016.

Their growth and revenue is very impressive. Comparing to what SQ and IPOE/SOFI offer, FUTU is a very impressive Fintech specifically around growth, revenue and margins.

With that said, I can't find any projections for 2021. With a PE of 107, if FUTU maintains triple digit growth, I think its easy to assume that their stock price will easily make its way to $200. Their forward PE is targeted at 30, which is low when compared to all the other overvalued companies we're seeing recently.


I think the biggest threat to FUTU right now is CPP regulations. They call it out in their 10k, that the are not an accredited securities dealer in China for Chinese stocks. Given the recent involvement of CPP, I think the looming specter of the PRC Ban-Hammer will be ever present. But the leadership of FUTU seems friendly to CCP and will bend the knee when necessary.


Does anyone have any other input on FUTU?

**tldr** I think FUTU is trading at a discount right now because of the recent Archegos shenanigans and growth stock beat down. But given that they're based in China and targeting expansion into SEA, I think FUTU is a great high growth and volatile company worth investing. They will live and die by their growth numbers."

And at the start of it, people were still saying it was a given that the US wouldn't re-enter this sector. People forgot the US government is a big enough (indirect) customer that they can indeed cause companies to build US fabs just via their own purchasing, and just by telegraphing that intent. So there are lots of new fabs getting built, there is going to be a lot of disruption in this sector, and anybody who lags will get punished.

Plus, in my opinion as a firmware engineer, we're on the verge of additional disruption with lots of new RISC-V microcontrollers and processors in the pipelines. This has the potential to further disrupt market share as it competes with ARM processors, and is cheaper and equally powerful platform for many of the new mixed-function ICs that are being developed. This will be good for the sector, but maybe not for the current leaders. I think TXN is going to hold their market share better than many other ARM vendors, because they have a bunch of US fabs already, but so does everybody else, and they're already trading at a premium.

For example, AMD are fabless so for them the chips themselves are just cost of revenue.

Just trying to get a handle on this. Semiconductors feel to me like the one industry I could point at and guarentee it will be bigger and more profitable in 10 years. So I can't really imagine not being invested in some way."

03/31/2021,stocks,"No semi  fabs shut down during Covid. Some ran at reduced capacities because companies canceled orders, because they thought the economy would slow."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yes, it makes a lot of sense, the problem is, it makes too much sense, and so too many people are already doing it and the prices are too high. Apple isn't actually in this group, though, they're trading almost exclusively on consumer preference, not tech, and they're a chip supplier to nobody.

The only reason I hold AMD is that I think the market doesn't understand the two patents AMD announced recently; I think they're part of a single future server product, based on my electronics engineering experience, and the market analysis think these are separate things. Including the public engineering analysis I've seen. They'll likely grow their server market share anyway, but that's already priced in. I think they're going to use their Xilinx acquisition on their x86 server chips, to speed up IO and offer mixed-type server chips with programmable IO interconnects. Nobody else thinks they're doing that, so the smart money is that I'm just a nutcase.ü§£

But once the details of the new US fabs are more clear, and they get closer to being operational, then there will be a lot of opportunity for speculative investment in small-cap competitors for those retail products. I don't see that hitting AMD or Intel, but the microcontroller vendors, MCHP, NXPI, SLAB, TXN, etc could come under pressure.
Nvidia isn't that exposed on the graphics side, but their networking side could get disrupted. Hard to know at this stage.
I don't think any of this risk has been priced in, because the fab details aren't clear enough. But there is certainly risk there for all these companies."

# LITTLE GUY BECOMES MARKET'S BIG MOVER

**By** **Tim SmartFebruary 2, 1999**

Cathy Wilkinson and Vinnie Cunning are two of the reasons the American economy is on fire. Both are avid investors in the stock market -- Wilkinson a novice, Cunning a veteran -- but each shows the way Wall Street has evolved in the past couple of decades from a province of the wealthy to a marketplace for the masses. Their experiences and behavior show how far the market permeates daily life for many people, so much so that now chatting about stocks has replaced talk about real estate as the topic du jour of the middle class. ""It's everywhere, it's at the water cooler, it's in the bars, it's at the beach,"" said Fairfax financial planner and investment-guide author Ric Edelman. ""When you turn on sitcoms, there's starting to be jokes about mutual funds. 

There is definitely a cultural change going on. Ordinary Americans are beginning to recognize wealth is within their grasp."" Just ask Wilkinson, a 45-year-old mother of four in Dewey, Ariz., who listens to the morning market commentary on National Public Radio while driving her children to school in her 1999 Volkswagen Beetle. The children regularly check their mother's portfolio on the personal computer and offer tips, recently egging her on to buy shares in Walt Disney Co. ""I have a pretty specific goal in this E-Trade account,"" she said, referring to the online brokerage she uses to buy and sell stocks. ""Any money made is to go to their {private-school} tuition. That was my lofty goal when I set it up."" 

A market novice who began buying individual stocks a month ago, Wilkinson boned up on finance by reading specialty periodicals such as Barron's and watching financial news networks such as CNN/fn. ""In reading, I was convinced the stock market was a good place for our money,"" said Wilkinson, who has about $75,000 invested. Her major holding? E-Trade. Like many new to online investing, Wilkinson concedes she initially became obsessed with surfing the message boards on the Motley Fool, an Alexandria-based company that is a modern-day equivalent of the village green for electronic investors. But lately, she said with a laugh, ""I've really been cutting down. I check in in the morning and then in the evening."" 

Alexandria mailman Cunning, on the other hand, doesn't even own a personal computer and he lacks cable television, too. But he does enjoy watching ""The Nightly Business Report"" on public television each evening. Cunning, 58, has been investing steadily in the market since the early 1980s, religiously putting the maximum $4,000 annual contribution for himself and his wife into individual retirement accounts, as well as contributing to a federal savings plan. He owns a broad array of mutual funds, from high-tech to large-cap growth stocks. He's had his share of losses, but the overall trend is up. ""From 1982 up to and including 1999, I have never missed a contribution and as I sit here and talk to you, my IRAs are over $300k,"" said Cunning, who mostly favors mutual funds but has also taken to some individual stocks. 

Economists and market experts say investors like Wilkinson and Cunning -- not the so-called ""smart money"" on Wall Street -- are the reasons behind the greatest bull market in history and, in part, what is already the longest domestic peacetime economic expansion ever. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan may fret about inflated stock values, questioning whether they reflected ""irrational exuberance,"" as he did two years and 3,000 points ago in the Dow Jones industrial average. But the 43 percent of adult households that now have money invested in stocks are having too much fun to stop. Even Greenspan may be softening, noting as he did Thursday that there is some economic logic behind the current frenzy in Internet stocks. Greenspan compared the Internet stock boom to a lottery, in which the size of the potential jackpot induces bettors to buy tickets -- despite the fact that most ticket holders will lose money. 

The trend of populist investing has been evolving for some time, starting with the removal of fixed commissions on stock trading in the mid-1970s, and gaining steam with the development of tax-advantaged retirement plans such as the IRA and 401(k) in the 1980s. But it picked up speed with the advent of affordable and accessible computer technology and now is on afterburn with the expansion of the Internet into everyday life. ""Without the Internet we wouldn't be able to do this stuff,"" said a 53-year-old worker for a District-based international organization who did not want his name used because he trades at work. The World Wide Web is full of online brokerages that offer trading costs as low as $8 a pop, or about one-tenth the amount full-service brokers used to charge. ""We all thought we could never invest against these professionals,"" the investor said. ""Now we're more skeptical."" 

There are lots of ways to measure this explosion of interest in the market among ordinary people, but a few statistics paint the picture: The number of investment clubs sanctioned by the National Association of Investors Corp., in which people of like interest place equal amounts of money into a pot to play the market, has doubled in the last three years to about 37,000, representing around 700,000 individuals investors. Assets under management at Charles Schwab & Co., the company that made the discount stock brokerage business respectable, reached $491 billion at the end of last year, a 39 percent increase in 12 months. The company has added 1.6 million new accounts in the past two years, bringing the total number of Schwab accounts to 5.6 million. In the fourth quarter, 61 percent of all Schwab's daily trades were conducted online, up from 41 percent a year earlier. 

In 1985, there was $105 billion invested in 401(k) accounts. At the end of 1997, the number was close to $1 trillion. The number of companies sponsoring plans for their employees, meanwhile, rose fourfold to 267,000. Nearly a third of the plans have average balances exceeding $50,000. In 1990, investors poured $12.8 billion in new money into stock mutual funds. By 1997, the most recent year for which data is available, that annual flow of cash into equity funds had hit $231 billion. Behind the numbers are real people, with real aspirations and apparently an almost limitless faith in the power of stocks to make them rich. It's a dramatic shift in sentiment from earlier generations, who lived in the shadow of the Great Depression and were largely indifferent to Wall Street. 

""For a long time, there was the specter of 1929,"" said Thomas O'Hara, chairman of NAIC, the investment association. ""You had parents and grandparents telling kids not to invest in the stock market. We think, probably starting around 15 years ago, that has run its course."" The thirst for stocks is even driving the economy, powering a binge of consumer spending that has been rising at a rate faster than income growth and producing the surprisingly robust 5.6 percent growth in national economic output, or gross domestic product, in the fourth quarter of last year. In fact, some market gurus and economists now half-jokingly say the market is the economy. They may just be right. While the nation's GDP is around $8 trillion annually, the current value of the stock market exceeds $14 trillion. ""People have become owners of the system,"" said Dan Carper, the partner in charge of marketing at Lord, Abbett & Co., a New York money management firm. 

This ""democratization"" of the market, as some call it, received a huge boost from the spread of IRAs, 401(k)s and other retirement accounts over the past two decades. They enabled companies to turn over to many workers much of the responsibility for building retirement nest eggs, turning employee At the same time, direct grants of stock, or options, have become a more common form of employee compensation. Once a perk mainly confined to Silicon Valley start-ups, options are now enjoyed by tellers at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis and shipyard workers at Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia. As people of all ages become more aware of the stock market, they become more comfortable with its risks, analysts say. 

Along with investors under age 30 who are too young to remember the last protracted downturn in the market (a quarter century ago) are the baby boomers, many scrambling to make up for lost time. ""Baby boomers are the first generation ever looking forward to retiring at 70 and lingering around for another 25 years,"" said Deutsche Bank Securities economist Edward E. Yardeni. This herd-like behavior, of course, scares the daylights out of many long-term professional investors and economists. When the Dow fell nearly 20 percent last summer, some of them saw it as a much-needed correction that would bring investor expectations back down to earth. ""This has been the best market of all to say, I can do it better on my own,' "" said John Markese, president of lthe American Association of Individual Investors. ""But this market is going to go sideways and even down for a while and these people will fall off in droves."" 

But so far, the individual investor has hung tough -- and behaved in a way that continues to confound the experts. Last year, after a period that economists classified as the worst financial crisis in a half-century, the Dow recorded its third consecutive double-digit annual increase. ""I think we're really just at the tip of the iceberg with the impact the individual investor is going to have on the market,"" said Mike Riley, who recently sold a golf course in Dayton, Ohio, for a handsome profit and is now investing $50,000 of his money in stocks of companies such as Dell Computer Corp. and Yahoo Inc. ""There's a whole different group of people out there."" They include people like Cathy Wilkinson, whose first month in the market was marked by a wild ride with Internet and other high-tech stocks. Showing the faith that is characteristic of the new breed of individual investors, Wilkinson said she'd stay the course if the market crashed. ""I'd still hang in,"" she said. ""I don't think I'd sell anything right now."" Furthermore, she said, what happens in the market isn't going to fundamentally alter her economic outlook or behavior, she said. ""I don't think it will change the amount of shoes I own.""

So the FTC has made a few decisions on certain mergers that are related to genomics-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests. They approved the merger between Exact Sciences (EXAS) and Thrive, which are both companies that are developing MCED tests. However, the FTC announced today that they will be challenging the Illumina (ILMN) and Grail merger, which will be **only the second vertical merger that the FTC has challenged in the past 40 years** (most mergers that are challenged are horizontal mergers).

It's interesting to see that the FTC approved the horizontal merger in this case, and not the vertical one. The FTC is arguing that the Illumina acquisition/merger with Grail will hinder competition in the MCED test market. The FTC previously challenged Illumina's M&A deal with Pacific Biosciences (PACB), a would-be horizontal merger, which ultimately fell through.

2021-03-31 02:53:51,stocks,"Long vs Short term capital gains scenarios I am curious about two scenarios on what would be categorized as long term vs short term capital gains. In particular, I am interested in knowing the tax laws for trading shares from the same company at different times throughout the calendar year. This is impactful to know if, for example, I want to average down on a particular stock. 

For each of the scenarios, the following applies:

* I buy 100 shares of stock-x on Jan 1, 2021
* I buy 50 more shares of stock-x  on Aug 1, 2021  


**Scenario 1**

* I sell 80 shares of stock-x for profit on Feb 1, 2022

**Scenario 2**

* I sell 130 shares of stock-x for profit on Feb 1, 2022

&#x200B;

Based on these scenarios, how will my capital gains be categorized? Aspects I'd like to know are if my capital gains will be partitioned into long term *and* short term tax rates? Or does it only matter the date of my original purchase into stock-x (meaning everything after a year of my *first* purchase is considered long term)? **I am mostly interested in federal tax rates, but I live in California (which taxes capital gains), so if anyone knows if California handles these capital gains scenarios the same way, please share your info.**"

#Goldman warns of investor ‚Äòguerrilla warfare‚Äô

The Supreme Court will hear arguments today from Goldman Sachs and from pension funds over a claim that the Wall Street giant misled investors about its work selling complex debt investments in the prelude to the 2008 financial crisis. In its latest brief, Goldman makes an interesting argument: Investors shouldn‚Äôt rely on statements such as ‚Äúhonesty is at the heart of our business‚Äù or ‚Äúour clients‚Äô interests always come first‚Äù that appear in S.E.C. filings and annual reports.

**The case is a test of shareholders‚Äô ability to sue over claims of investment fraud.** The pension funds have sought to sue as a class over Goldman‚Äôs statements, saying that they believed the claims of honesty. Goldman has argued in its latest brief that the investors are resorting to ‚Äúguerrilla warfare‚Äù and aren‚Äôt providing ‚Äúserious legal arguments.‚Äù The bank says that an investor victory would lead to a barrage of future lawsuits over ‚Äúgeneral and aspirational statements‚Äù of the kind made by ‚Äúvirtually every public company in America.‚Äù

- The Biden administration isn‚Äôt taking sides but will say today that ‚Äúmeritorious private securities-fraud suits‚Äù are ‚Äúan essential complement‚Äù to enforcing securities laws.

**How a former S.E.C. commissioner thinks the court will respond to Goldman‚Äôs arguments:** ‚ÄúI expect the court to be troubled by the claim that companies cannot be held accountable for saying that clients come first and then acting otherwise,‚Äù Robert Jackson Jr., who served on the commission from 2018 to 2020 and is now an N.Y.U. law professor, told DealBook. (The justices probably won‚Äôt agree with the claim that making a company ‚Äúmean what it says‚Äù will lead to a tsunami of meritless lawsuits, he added.) Regardless, Goldman is right that the stakes are high, he said, since the case will probably decide whether shareholders can ‚Äúhold corporate insiders accountable when they tell investors one thing and do another.‚Äù"

I agree with Schmittfried . Many people think of purpose to life as some kind of an end goal to achieve, but the experience in itself could be the purpose. Schmittfried listed great personal experiences, but there are social experiences as well.

I'm just saying, it's right there in the NPR article, which notes in particular that media lawyers consider them the same ""sort of defense.""

2021-03-31 02:07:33,stocks,"Blink Charging ($BLNK) is Scheme to Siphon Money to the Pockets of Insiders Blink Charging Co, headed by CEO Michael D. Farkas, claims to own, operate, and provide electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and networks throughout the United States. It currently offers both residential and commercial EV charging equipment and utilizes a real-time cloud-based system to track the current usage and operation of its EV charging stations. Currently, Blink claims to have over 15,000 of these EV charging stations in operation throughout the U.S. And closing today with a share price of $36.98, Blink seems to give investors and analysts alike hope that it has great prospects to become a large firm in the EV charging space. However, as I'll discuss in further detail, everything about this company - its operations, financials, and leadership - are rotten to the core. 

*Data for this post was* [*sourced*](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cc91fda7-4669-4d1b-81ce-a0b8d77f25ab/downloads/Culper_BLNK_8-19-2020.pdf?ver=1615557473084) *from the Culper Research Report on Blink Charging Co, published in August of 2020. I have no reason to believe that significant changes have occurred since.*

*I am not an analyst or financial professional nor do I have any positions (or plan to open any) in Blink Charging Co.*

&#x200B;

1. 15,000 charging stations sounds impressive compared to Tesla's 5000; 2,192 does not.

According to Culper Research's inquiries, ""Our on-the-ground visits to 242 stations at 88 locations across the U.S. revealed a plethora of neglected, abused, non-functional, or otherwise missing chargers. Our analysis of the Company‚Äôs own data suggests that the average charger is utilized for just 6 to 38 minutes per day (0.39% to 2.65% utilization), while annual charging revenue of a mere $6.37 per member suggests that the average Blink member doesn‚Äôt even obtain one single full charge from the Blink network over the course of an entire year."" 

In terms of charging stations, ""As of June 30, 2020, the Company had 15,151 charging stations deployed, of which, 5,385 were Level 2 commercial charging units, 102 were DC Fast Charging EV chargers and 1,193 were residential charging units. Additionally, as of June 30, 2020, the Company had 305 Level 2 commercial charging units on other networks and there were also 8,166 non-networked, residential Blink EV charging stations.‚Äù 

Why's that important? Well, ""Unless Blink expects that all residential charger owners are set to open their garages for complete strangers to steal their electricity, the Company‚Äôs claim that ‚ÄúEV drivers can easily charge at any of its 15,000 charging \[stations\]‚Äù is an egregious overstatement which we suspect has been designed to mislead investors.""

And of the 5385 charging stations remaining, fewer are listed by the company's own app, ""Our sampling suggests that of the 3,275 chargers listed on the Company‚Äôs map, only 67% of these, or 2,192, exist, are functional, and are publicly accessible.""

&#x200B;

2. Blink's earnings compared to compensation expenses shed light on its true purpose.

Culper also found that, ""Since 2014, compensation expense of $44 million is more than double the Company‚Äôs $18 million in cumulative revenues, which have remained flat despite the Company‚Äôs incessant promotion of supposedly groundbreaking partnerships, international expansions, and new technology under development.""

But for a mid-cap company valued at $1.5 billion, only 88 employees are on LinkedIn. 

But how does tanking the company help executives? Culper states, ""Farkas has now dumped at least 1.8 million shares over the past 2 years while at least 7 executives and board members have left the Company. This mass exodus has culminated with COO James Christodoulou in March 2020. Christodoulou is now suing Farkas and the Company, citing numerous counts of securities fraud. Also in March 2020, the Company‚Äôs primary lender and 9.9% shareholder ‚Äì Justin Keener ‚Äì was charged by the SEC, which cited toxic convertible lending practices... Thus, Blink has turned to the PPP program, taking a loan which it has already burned through and does not intend to repay."" 

&#x200B;

3. Michael Farkas has done this before.

Below are three separate instances of Farkas' involvement in fraudulent schemes that parallel what's happening with Blink.

""Skyway Communications (formerly SWYC) purported to be ‚Äúdeveloping a ground to air in-flight aircraft communication network that we anticipate will facilitate homeland security and in-flight entertainment.‚Äù However, this was effectively a front. In 2006, an aircraft was seized by the Mexican government holding 5.6 tons of cocaine, reportedly $100 million worth. With Farkas as the company‚Äôs largest investor, at one point holding majority ownership, the stock collapsed, and Skyway‚Äôs principals were sued by the SEC for the pump-and-dump scheme. Farkas denied knowledge of the scheme, even as Skyway had just 2 employees and shared an office with Farkas‚Äôs investment firm, which was a majority owner. 

At GenesisIntermedia, Inc. / Genesis Realty Group, (formerly GENI), Farkas worked with Jeffrey and Darren Glick, Adnan Khashoggi, and Ramy El-Batrawi. The group was sued by the SEC, alleging, in sum, ‚Äúa scheme to manipulate the stock price of GENI, now-defunct public company, and misappropriated more than $130 million in the process.‚Äù This was part of a broader scheme, which also involved Atlas Recreational / Holiday RV Superstores, where Farkas was a majority owner with 59% of the company. As part of this scheme, the SEC also brought charges against MJK Clearing, Inc., a.k.a. ‚ÄúStockwalk‚Äù, which lost more than $200 million and was forced into liquidation. 

With respect to Red Sea Management Limited, Farkas and his Atlas group of companies were sued for fraud relating to co-involvement in Skyway. Red Sea was also involved with several additional public issuers including SLS International, Inc. GeneThera, Inc., and Freedom Golf Corporation. To that end, the SEC also sued Red Sea, alleging that it conducted ‚Äúfraudulent pump-and-dump schemes on behalf of its clients and laundered millions of dollars in illegal trading proceeds out of the United States to its clients overseas.‚Äù Red Sea was also tied to online gambling, money laundering, short-term payday loans, and bootlegged/pirated TV shows.""

&#x200B;

TL;DR and Summary

Blink Charging Company's claim of operating over 15,000 charging units is misleading on two accounts: only 2,192 can be accessed by consumers and the average charger earns a revenue of just $6.37 annually.

Blink's cumulative earnings are abysmal yet employee compensations remain sky-high, $18 million to $44 million since 2014 respectively. Meanwhile, CEO Michael Farkas continues to dump millions of shares and collect a salary of $548,000. 

Farkas also has a long history with massive criminal schemes and generally fraudulent behavior. If that's not enough, an 8.88% owner of Blink is also directly tied to the panama papers.

In conclusion, Blink Charging is just another scam by CEO Michael Farkas. It has courted investors with a vision of the future and a fa√ßade of long-term viability. In reality, its slowly bleeding out and the only person benefitting is Farkas.

UPDATE: 
Many people are wondering, ‚Äúwhy not short or put Blink right now?‚Äù As some have pointed out, since the August 2020 Culper Research report and subsequent Mariner Research Group downgrade, Blink‚Äôs share price has actually increased from roughly 10$ to its current price. Clearly, the investors don‚Äôt care about the inherent risk of their investment. However, a lawsuit was filed in October and is currently underway (website for relevant updates: https://www.hbsslaw.com/cases/BLNK). Investor fraud lawsuits generally take 2-4 years to be resolved and it‚Äôs possible that these repercussions won‚Äôt be felt by Blink or fully realized by investors until that date. In the meantime, there are too many possibilities for Blink, whether that‚Äôs a management adjustment or immediate bankruptcy, and it‚Äôs just too risky to take that long of a position."

03/31/2021,stocks,"My husband worked on a very large university campus and was in charge of managing contracts, installations, and maintenance of all EV charging stations. They had a mix of Blink and Chargepoint. He said working with Blink was a massive nightmare and absolutely not beneficial to the host location of the chargers.

03/31/2021,stocks,Be careful with puts. I bought 2 year puts at $20 strike on this when it was at $52. Now it‚Äôs $39 but I‚Äôm still losing money on the puts cuz the volatility came down for some inexplicable reason.

03/31/2021,stocks,As an EV owner for several years I cannot stress this enough - I only want to charge at home... Its one of the big unsung advantages of owning an EV. In the almost 3 years of EV ownership I‚Äôve never charged outside the home unless I was on a road trip.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Thanks for putting this up - I was planning on putting together a formal DD on BLNK because I had come to similar conclusions.

The EV scene is absolutely littered with cases like this, sad to see"

03/31/2021,stocks,So why is Farkas not in prison?
03/31/2021,stocks,"Like I said before, I know street corner liquor store with higher revenue than $BLNK selling scratchers and Vodka.

$BLNK and SPACs show why the market is fkd, pull back will hit again soon or later on these trash companies with over valuation"

03/31/2021,stocks,"To anyone who has bought BLNK, do not be surprised if the stock goes to 3$. Even at 3$ it could not be considered undervalued. If it goes from 36$ to 3$ dont come to reddit asking what the hell is happening to BLNK!?"

03/31/2021,stocks,RIP my lack of DD. Any recommend competitors to BLINK to invest in I like the EV space

03/31/2021,stocks,"Even Reuters gives them a score of 1, with an optimized score of...... yep, 1... I almost want to have faith in analysts again"

Thanks OP!"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I thought the same thing, the Culper research is old at this point. I went to the BLNK map and literally went through and skim counted their charging stations. The number of stations on the map you could use was around where it needed to be. I don't hold any BLNK, I bought them at $6 a share and sold at $60."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Interestingly enough, I dropped my shares at $7.50 when this first came out. Could‚Äôve held on and made a quick buck. Oh well."
03/31/2021,stocks,That TLDR is longgg.

03/31/2021,stocks,I‚Äôll never understand why $BLNK price per share is at 36$ while $CHPT the leading ev charging station with 90.3Million in the U.S and already having stations in the EU is at $22 per share
03/31/2021,stocks,"I'll just buy some $PLUG, slightly less risky and a lot less stinky"
03/31/2021,stocks,"I think the OP's statement in the summary, ""the average charger earns a revenue of just $6.37 annually"" is errant. It's the average member only using a station for $6.37 worth of charging annually. But as I understand it, membership means they're paying a monthly/annual amount to the company, probably far in excess of the $6.37 they're actually using. So this means more money in the company's pockets with less expense. Unless I misunderstand it, this just illustrates that they have or will have massive membership turnover."
03/31/2021,stocks,I bought Chargepoint as SBE at $40.  AMA.

03/31/2021,stocks,"Can you hold puts indefinitely? I assumed they have an expiry just like calls. In this scenario I would think we are a couple years away from this company becoming worthless (time for market to get over EV hype, and then off the market to realise this a turd stock). 

Do you buy puts with a really long expiry? Can you buy calls/puts with expiries in +years?

EDIT: I can indeed use Google, and am using Google. In fact I've googled many times today. Doesn't mean I can't also ask on Reddit... Surprise! I use both!

SOURCE: Own a a bunch of puts."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Nah, shorting is basically a synonym of selling. We tend to use ‚Äúshort‚Äù because when you say ‚Äúselling‚Äù, it implies you owned the shares and you sold them to have a position of 0. When you sell shares to have a position of -50 shares, we say short to avoid the confusion. You can have a short position on almost anything like stocks, options, futures, bonds, etc."
03/31/2021,stocks,Shorting is actually the exact opposite of going long.  You sell the shares now and rebuy them.  Some brokers don't allow this (RH) and thus the only way to go short is through options.
03/31/2021,stocks,Why not short it as surely it‚Äôs going to tank?
03/31/2021,stocks,"Puts / Calls at about a year out are called LEAPS, Yes. You can also buy them multiple years in future, if available for that stock yes.

03/31/2021,stocks,I made a lot of money buying puts on NKLA when it was in the 30s and 40s.
03/31/2021,stocks,Fair.
03/31/2021,stocks,ahhh ok - thanks!
03/31/2021,stocks,Sorry not getting that. So do you need to own the underlying stock in order to short it?
03/31/2021,stocks,timing. even fresh lawsuits and a downgrade to $1 by Mariner in september didn‚Äôt stop the bulls from controlling this stock. the market doesn‚Äôt care about fundamentals (or even fraud it seems) so it may be some time until reality catches up to Blink.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Out of interest when would you buy puts? 

For me I think BLNK is a prime target if what OP said is true, and the guy at the top is just pump and dumping this company to make a buck, eventually that will catch up. But my hesitations would be;

The EV market is the 'in vogue' market of today. It's where everyone sees our future and to an extent good news in the EV market rises all ships. My concern would be that investors simply won't take this view (OP) until it's too late; aka I think the ability to pick the right strike date (think that's the right term?) Is pretty much 0. 

I could get behind shorting. Because then you don't have a time limit, and I think that ties in better with what OP suggests is the problem (the helmsmen). As you can short believing this company will eventually fail/will at somepoint stop being overvalued. Whereas with the puts the expiry is going to be all or nothing. 

I suppose what I am actually trying to ask is;
Why or would you use puts instead of shorts? Other than for the additional gains?
For this stock in particular would you buy puts this far out? Or is this one for the back burner until an opportunity arises? 

I think humans ability to predict forward more than a month is pretty sketchy, not sure I'd trust my 2 year judgements ü§î"
03/31/2021,stocks,i agree with you there but my point is just that this stock will go to zero eventually. i‚Äôm not actively suggesting people short it now or ever because the market doesn‚Äôt care about valuations and timing the death of this company is near impossible.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Hard disagree imo. Hydrogen has huge barriers to entry (not allowed in some tunnels/garages) and there are minimal hydrogen fuel centers in the US. Not to mention the stock is 10x what it was a year ago with negative EPS. I think PLUG is one of the worst stock picks personally, but hey I could be totally wrong."
03/31/2021,stocks,Ehh id still recommend averaging down. Chpt was bound to drop but as you said.. I am bull because of all of that. My average is 16 after averaging up during the feb dip. Ill hold chpt for 10 years for sure.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Youre right. totally.. and this was hyperbole and I shouldnt have said it to be taken literal. However. I do agree there is competition but the places I have seen Chargepoint make me bullish. they got the nod from DIS, they're in state parks..theres a hang up for the ev thing to take off. but I think people are sleeping on chpt and will be said as it soars with the rise of ev over 10 years. Exxon a stretch. I agree. but insanely undervalued right now for a 5+ eyar timeline.

!remindme 5 years"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Hell if I buy at 25 right now I'll be averaging UP over 60%. I've liked chargepoint for almost a year now, but touching it over 40... Man. In 5 years that might seem like a deal, but I sold half my starting position when that hit. To you, apparently."
03/31/2021,stocks,"You don't. Shorting a stock is when you lend out shares at the current market price hoping the stock price falls. You then recall the shares at the lower price and profit from the difference. However, if the price rises and the share is bought by someone, you're required to provide it, whether you actually own it or not. If you own it, you're position is ""covered,"" if you don't, you're ""naked."" The GME situation is a result of naked shorting (among other things)."
03/31/2021,stocks,"You don‚Äôt. The theory is that someone owns X stock through Y company. Y lends the share out to H which sells it on the market with the intent to buy a share back at a lower price and give back to the lender and pocket the difference - the lending fee which majority of it goes to Y and not the lender, essentially misrepresenting the real buy-sell ratio at that time of sale which can and does have negative effects on the stock price. People who own stock because they believe it will do well, their shares gets lent out and sold and the person who lent it out receives barely anything for the lending and most probably the stock price will decrease."
03/31/2021,stocks,Fair but if you know like we do here that there is a history of fraud and this is bogus why not short it and set it for longer duration. Say 3 years?
03/31/2021,stocks,"The date is called an expiry date. The price the option states is the strike price (example, a $25 4/16 Call).

I would buy Puts instead of Shorts because the maximum loss on a Put is the Premium price I paid for the option. So if a few contracts cost me $500, and expire worthless, I lose my $500. That's it. With shorts, if it for some reason rockets your losses are infinite, as the price can go higher, higher, higher, and you eventually have to pay those shares back that you have borrowed. Shorts are VERY sketch and I wouldn't ever buy them (you probably can't anyways) unless you were absolutely sure of something.

Personally I haven't bought any yet because the stock is up like 9% today, so clearly the market either doesn't agree with OP's sentiment, or it's a delayed reaction. Sometimes it's best to wait than to try and jump onto a moving train."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Price is very important.  I agree with you and think blink has no future, but that doesn‚Äôt you can‚Äôt make money on it.  I would never buy and hold something like blink but trading it; maybe.  As we have seen with other fraud and high flyers; everything can be brought for a price.

NKLA @30 - bad
NKLA @ 12‚Äî maybe worth a gamble?
Ride @30‚Äì bad; Ride@13- maybe?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Heck, I could be totally wrong! But if I had to chooser between the two I would go with PLUG."

03/31/2021,stocks,"Could be huge for sure!  Just seems like a low barrier for entry with tons of competition popping up everywhere.  The other thing though, is that electricity isn't that expensive, and the cost to fill up probably isn't going to be netting them crazy returns per charge"
03/31/2021,stocks,But we can‚Äôt ignore the fact that they‚Äôve been the biggest fish in the pond for 14 years now. They‚Äôve beeb early adopters and innovators for a long time. I‚Äôm incredibly bullish.
03/31/2021,stocks,I just should have waited. I see it now but I‚Äôm still believing in them long term so with a new Cost basis at 29 I‚Äôm good to just hold for a few decades. I definitely believe in EV as an industry. It can only really get better and chargepoint has a hardcore testing facility that I‚Äôm not sure the other companies have but haven‚Äôt done research on the others

03/31/2021,stocks,"added a more in depth explanation of my logic in a post update. basically though, a longer timeframe means that there‚Äôs more opportunities for Blink to adjust. whether that‚Äôs through a change in leadership or Farkas realizing that his pump and dump might actually be viable, it‚Äôs risky to engage in such a long short position."
03/31/2021,stocks,I just looked the borrow rate is 44% 3 years and its impossible to profit
03/31/2021,stocks,"Ask anyone that shorted GME how they're feeling.

Buying puts involves a lot of additional premium and shorting shares has the risk of getting margin called.

It's honestly difficult to make money shorting unless you get the timing perfectly or have lots of time and money to wait it out."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Hey thanks, great breakdown. I see what your saying, the shorts have unlimited risk and the puts don't. I don't know why but I had assumed the puts had a similar risk. You either are in the money or you aren't and you can let them expire worthless; so like you said you just end up paying out the cost you paid for the option. 

I will definitely do a little digging then. As I'm usually a learn by doing guy. I have created a collection of charts watching the EV names. I think until they break synchronisation and the OPs sentiment is more broadly known, it's too risky. I personally was in one of these sorts of stocks; canntrust. Thing was in lock step until the news broke, but even then it was still quite a delayed reaction before it started to tank. So I will keep my eye on BLNK and maybe in the future il dabble. Thanks for the explanation."
03/31/2021,stocks,"There's been good opportunity to average down. I missed a drop on warrants to sub 7 dollars that I'm still pissed about a couple of weeks ago, commons in the mid teens. Hell I sold Ford to buy more when it dropped after merger."

03/31/2021,stocks,Ok thanks for the explanation.
03/31/2021,stocks,"No worries at all. I try to remember that when buying Options the volatility is exponentially multiplied. So if a stock drops 2-3% one day, often the option Premium will drop 30-50%, or vice versa going up. They are more about sentiment. 

Best of luck!"

2021-03-31 01:55:30,stocks,"$ZKIN the mystery about spreading fake news Good evening, so those who might be in $ZKIN probably knows, that its just a rollercoaster. u can open the day with a smile and end up crying or the other way around.

&#x200B;

last week was pretty consistent aout reaching an high, and then bounce back right there, this became a thing we got used to, but this week we had also 3 halts when the stock rose to fast back (sometimes because of news, but other times just after short's covering and daytraders joinning)

&#x200B;

but today, even tho we, as we at least thought, seen everything, cant be surprised by anything, we were just waiting for a PR to light up the stock again, which the company release very often, porbably awares for the impact.

&#x200B;

we sure did got PR today, of the share offering - which occured 2 years ago, the stock spiked down instantly, breaking the up trend to a huge down trend. which is very weird, why would a company all of a sudden would make such big headline of something related to the past which obviously would crush their stocks? the answer? they didnt! appreantly it have been taken down after 2 hours, after the damage have been done. 

so what things like that means exactly, what me as investor should notice or be prepared to?

&#x200B;

TL;DR : rando ppl probably released a fake PR , with bad news in oreder to make a sell of in a stock, the PR have been deleted. what it means to me as an investor?"

I still don't understand why though, does it have something to do with the dividend payout structure?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"No it depends on the ETF, not all are index based. Some are actively managed (e.g. most ARK ETFs)."

However the companies within the ETF are mostly solid, so I imagine the ETF doing well going into the future. I think at the moment they are trying to provide a stable base in this market environment from which they will eventually reduce positions in the non-space companies and take a stake in a few SPACS once they merge.

03/31/2021,stocks,I feel like I read about a filing to allow them to add more companies to the fund's holdings
03/31/2021,stocks,"Is ICLN still a solid ETF to invest in? I just started researching renewables today and there's so many god damn companies that I just want to go in to an ETF at this point, but I dont want to get burnt on reddit hype which this looks to have recieved."
03/31/2021,stocks,"The good news is the momentum seems to be starting to turn around, particularly with the wind companies"
03/31/2021,stocks,"In my honest opinion, I still think this is a bit overpriced in the longterm. I think we've priced in the future of these companies way too early, but I think in the short term, there's a strong possibility for growth. I feel like $20-22 at most, is a fair price for ICLN right now, but as you've seen over the past months, this market is irrational. People want to jump in on the clean energy hype."

03/31/2021,stocks,Isn‚Äôt 17mill pennies for an etf like this?
03/31/2021,stocks,Wish they were going heavier in wind and perhaps solar. Seems more solid and realistic cash generation long term.
03/31/2021,stocks,I dunno ask Enphase
03/31/2021,stocks,"There were regulatory changes that pertained to, I think, inverters. A lot of companies lost compliance overnight. 

Enphase was the only company operating at scale that wasn‚Äôt effected by the new standards, so they had the market to themselves, but over time this advantage shrinks as other manufacturers get aligned.

Whatever success they have in the future will depend on using their clout to form partnerships, deepen integration into other systems, and/or expand their repertoire. 

The bear case is that their key products will end up competing on price, losing as commodification kills margins.

Something like that..."
03/31/2021,stocks,"You're right, but it's far more than the 100k they had only a month ago. If I had to guess, they sold some of their shares as the stocks moved upwards, and began buying them back on the downward move, and ended up with extra cash on hand."
03/31/2021,stocks,"According to the fact sheet, the whole fund is worth about $80mil, so $17mil is quite a lot."

2021-03-31 01:27:17,stocks,"Sberbank: Russian state-owned bank looking to become tech company Sberbank is the largest Russia bank, and about half owned by the state, but the shares also trade OTC in the US as SBRCY. They've had the ambitions to expand into online retail, food delivery, streaming, and cloud computing: basically everything Alibaba or Amazon does, and they've got a captive market in Russia that basically acts as a moat. 

Pretty quick and not very informative but here's an article that goes over that stuff:

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sberbank-ceo-to-expand-ecosystem-for-life-beyond-banking-2021-03-03

Today the 2020 report came out for shareholders and it's emphasizes this stuff more than I thought it would:

https://www.sberbank.ru/common/img/uploaded/_new_site/com/gosa2021/yr-sber-ar20-eng.pdf

>98.9 million active retail clients, 2.7m active corporate clients, 50 companies in Sber ecosystem, 14.2k branches

That's a big base for business, and if they start using the branches of the bank, as has been speculated, as mini fulfillment centers it's a huge start. 

>revenue from non-financial digital companies attributable to Sber rose from 26.4 billion ruples in 2019 to over 70 in 2020

I won't copy and paste big chunks of the report but if you glance through the report they're clearly hyping the pivot into tech a lot. IMO they're picking a good type to use their capital to pivot to new spaces, as the margins on their commercial banking shrinks. I don't think there's an easy comparison for a company pivoting on this scale, but they're taking it seriously and have the resources to do it. And if you buy it in the meantime it's a bank that pays out fat dividends that doesn't seem to have this pivot priced in yet."
03/31/2021,stocks,"as one of their 98.9 million clients, I can say without reservations- they suck.....  it would be ok if they shared some of their ****** gains w me, but thanks for the DD, now I know which ticker is good for puts - as soon as I empty my acct there (or they do it through fees)...."
03/31/2021,stocks,Are there other viable options for banking where you are?
03/31/2021,stocks,"its one of my EU bank accts (they bought out previous bank where I had acct), very difficult to open acct for Americans in some EU countries."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Oh that's interesting. Yeah I read they've had some acquisitions in other countries over the years, was curious how that was going from a consumer POV. I guess you're a captive audience lol."

03/31/2021,stocks,"I looked at BB at around $7 end of 2020. I really wanted to believe that the company was at a turning point. Did some DD and came to the conclusion that the company was on the right track but the leadership, the CEO in particular, was a cost-cutting turn-around machine, and not a growth or innovation leader. I looked into his previous roles as well as what employees were saying, they echoed this - the CEO just want to keep restructuring and cutting costs, this was the biggest red flag for me.

I've worked for large public companies that have leaders that just focus on cutting costs, you can only cut costs and restructure so many times before it starts shitting on morale and affecting growth.

There's already so much growth caked into the current share price, BB really needs leadership to make that growth a reality, they can't just keep restructuring and cutting costs to try and hit targets."
03/31/2021,stocks,So...if this goes down to 7 tomorrow is it worth a buy to lower my average price per share?
03/31/2021,stocks,"Scrolling through the comments. Absolutely none of you is talking about their ongoing sale of part of the patent portfolio of mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. 

The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.

Also looks like none of you listened to the conf call in which CEO said it would bring an one-off big payment +7 years royalties. I‚Äôm not going to bother talking about him saying no dilution in sight.

Let‚Äôs also ignore their $800m in cash (15% of their market cap). Need not to mention that now 23 out of 25 EV OEMs are working with BB now (up from 19 past quarter).

Just be fed the narrative and continuing on not digging further. 

I‚Äôm not surprised to read many here are bag holding at $17+ prices probably because you were lazy doing some research when it was worth $6."

Truth be told, this was my first dive into the stock market and I'm at peace knowing that I learned a lot by making this mistake and taking a loss in this situation. I'm sure BB will be a fine stock to own in 2023 or whatever, but I 'd rather take the money (and accept the loss) that was in BB and put elsewhere in the meantime.

03/31/2021,stocks,"Yup I lost most of my investment in GME in January, was down 90% on my 25k investment at one point in feb, but was I going to sell and take a loss, fuck no. Held and not only did I recover it, I made 1500 bucks. Then sold before it dipped again üôÇ. Long story short, I‚Äôm not taking a loss on BlackBerry, luckily my cost basis is around 11, which isn‚Äôt too bad imho. I‚Äôm probably going to average down this time, which I didn‚Äôt don with GME and absolutely regretted it"

03/31/2021,stocks,BB was never a truly short term play except for the 1 week around the pump. 2021 and/or 2022 always looked like they'd be the bigger growth years before settling off again. Most of their big moves haven't even hit the market yet.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Despite losing almost $1,000 CAD (in value) this morning.  You're not exactly in the worst position.

Short term holders were buying in at $16+ a few months ago and are experiencing massive and total losses.  Blackberry is an old hardware company that is converting into a software security firm.  There was no reason for them to be worth $25/share right now.  They might be worth that some day.  But it makes no sense for them to be worth that today.

I'm buying in today at $10/share because I think that's a discount price.  I think you bought in closer to what they're actually worth right now."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I have a friend that bought back when Blackberry was $45-$50. He's been holding ever since.

03/31/2021,stocks,As a BB holder.. I can confirm .
03/31/2021,stocks,"I have to disagree. Although Chen is possibly a cost cutting machine, he also talked about how BB is positioned for growth over the next few years. He also acknowledged the reality that 2021 was going to suck. I mean everyone knew this before earnings and confirmation bias got the better of everyone. 


People are buying into the stock to make 5x or more but this turnaround story will take some time especially if they want to do it right and be market leaders.


A few years from now I‚Äôm confident we will look back and laugh at being worried. The EV space is just starting to take off. Or I could be wrong since I‚Äôm not a financial advisor and none of what I said should be considered financial advice. Do your own DD, read up the earnings call transcript again and come to your own conclusion."

03/31/2021,stocks,If it goes to 7 definitely
03/31/2021,stocks,I 100% agree. Too much confirmation bias for apparent quick wins and no real DD in this thread. BB is working on a strong foundation and that shit takes time.

03/31/2021,stocks,BB hasn‚Äôt followed the GME rally in a while. Just straight and simple bag holding in this thread

03/31/2021,stocks,"Back in January 2021, I also feared that BB would have a bad quarterly result. I'm sad that I'm right. This means that so many small investors (potentially) lost of lot of money tonight and during the upcoming days/weeks/months. For most of them, they probably bought BB stocks during the hype. Probably with their hard earned money.

I really hate seeing the small investors losing their money. For them, I truly hope that BB will eventually become again a force to reckon it."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I swear I seen that comment, took me 10 minutes to find I almost gave up. Posted it mid January. Good on ya. Retroactive upvote there"
03/31/2021,stocks,Congrats on your big win with your puts.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Nobody likes a smug asshole, except the smug asshole it appears. God damn it feels good to be right about this company. 

I was long these guys at $4 last year, and made tons of money on them. I dont think they are worthless at all. Just absolutely stupid at their current value.

This aint WSB, I thought we were retrospective here. If it makes the current losers feel better, i made huge bets on exxon in January 2020. I ate shit then because of a risky and dumb play, now you are eating shit.
Im sure I will be on the wrong end of more risky garbage by the end of the year. 

Shake it off and become more cynical of the shitbags on reddit trying to sell you their bags. In this same exact post, I see like 5 guys shilling about how now its a bargain, that you should DCA, and other insame, pump and dump garbage.

You know when the absolutely stupidest time to DCA on a stock is? When it disappoints on earnings for an entire year, during whats SUPPOSED to be a security tech boom. You should see that and run. You DCA during corrections on GOOD stocks, like Apple. Or stocks with high intrinsic value that have sunk during corrections, making the stock price not reflect reality. 

 I see 13 IQ scam artists crowding the market these days with terrible advice on reddit. I dont think I know dick, I just know enough that 99% of the shit I read on here is absolutely, logically, plain wrong."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Save some downvotes for me pal. Imagine looking at past 6 quarters of this company and thinking things are peachy.

Momentum trading only works until the momentum runs out. This thing might even rocket again some more due to its low market cap making it perfect for day trading and social media manipulation. Im not betting against that.

At the end of the day though, unless BB makes some headwinds for once, or inflation consumes our souls as foretold in the yield prophecies, they are a 3 billion MC stock on a good day.

You can follow my nasty, smug, stupid, and definitely self-righteous comments about BB all the way back to August last year if you are feelin bored."
03/31/2021,stocks,We'll probably see $6 by the end of this week...
03/31/2021,stocks,"You are right. It's only the future that counts, forget the ""sunk cost bias"". 

If you believe the recovering will take a long time or never happen and you have better chances with another stock, sell it. 

However, most shares recover after a time. Panic-selling is usually not good. Buying a diverse portfolio and forgetting it for a few years can be an amazing strategy."

If you want to increase risk for increased profits, you can look at what the price of the stock has been doing and select a strike price below your basis but fairly well above what the stock has been going for."

03/31/2021,stocks,"Oooof, ouch man. Yes I'd at least try it out & one thing that hasn't been mentioned in this thread is that if you absolutely hate the idea of shares getting called away at less than your cost basis is the idea of ""rolling up and out."" This just means that if the stock rises above your strike price and you don't want to let it go, you buy to close one covered call (at a loss) and then turn right around and sell to open another one at a higher strike for some period further in the future and hopefully you either break even or even come out slightly ahead on that transaction. The Options Bootcamp podcast is a good resource."
03/31/2021,stocks,"You don‚Äôt have to sell covered calls for all your shares, but yes I think it‚Äôs worth it. It will help you re coup some cost. I don‚Äôt see BB going past $12 anytime soon. But be aware that if it does whatever strike price you sell your covered calls at can
Be exercised. Also it‚Äôs best to sell a covered call while the stock is on an upward trend because the premiums will be in your favor and you can make more money. Generally it best to sell covered calls above your cost basis, but it‚Äôs up to the individual. Not financial advice, just opinion. Each 100 shares is a contract, so you could easily sell 5 contracts to recoup some cost while saving your other shares from being assigned. Like I said today I sold one contract for $21 total. If you did that for 5 (500 shares) you would be making $100 a week if nothing got assigned.  Over 1 year that would equate to 5k but that depends a lot on premiums and IV/ delta."

$22.50 and $25 were previous support levels. I went with $26 because I want to keep my shares and it had a low .3something delta. I‚Äôll close around 50% profit or near 14 DTE if it‚Äôs profitable. If it goes bad and the shares are called away, it‚Äôs still over an 11% gain for my average price."

A weekly means that I am selling my covered call each week, so the option contract I‚Äôm selling expires by the end of the week. 
For instance I have 100 shares of BB, I sold a covered call for BB at a strike price of $11 today, the premium was .21 per share (times 100 shares) equals $21

What this means is that I automatically get the $21 for selling my contract (covered call, and an obligation to sell my shares at $11 if the call gets exercised)  I have to hold onto those 100 shares through this week. If the price of the stock goes to $11 I can be ‚Äòassigned‚Äô meaning that I am obligated to sell my 100 shares at $11 (so $1100) plus I get to keep the premium from the contract ($21)

If the covered call does not get exercised and expires worthless I get to keep the $21 and my shares."
03/31/2021,stocks,He‚Äôs saying sell covered calls that expire on Friday each week.
03/31/2021,stocks,Selling weeklies is selling options. Those that play with options have to pay a premium to get the contract. If you sell options you put up either stock or cash as collateral for the option and are paid a premium.
03/31/2021,stocks,Selling covered calls every week.

03/31/2021,stocks,"I'd suggest looking into it. You can essentially lower your cost basis doing this. I've made 25 bucks off 100 shares the last two weeks. It's not much, but over time it will really bring down my average.

03/31/2021,stocks,"One thing to keep in mind when you're selling weeklies, that I never seen anyone mention, is the timer for your stock to turn into a LTCG is paused if an unqualified CC is sold with a DTE of <30 days.  So you could own the stock for the LTCG holding period but if you've sold unqualified covered calls the whole time, when/if gets called away you it's still going to be a STCG.  I *think* it also applies to if you just sell it as well, but the rules are kind of messy, and I don't sell weeklies, so I stopped looking into it.



[From Fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/tax-implications-covered-calls)
emphasis mine

*  A qualified covered call is a covered call with **more than 30 days to expiration** at the time it is written and a strike price that is not ""deep in the money.""

*  According to Taxes and Investing (page 23), ""Writing an at-the-money or an out-of-the-money qualified covered call allows the holding period of the underlying stock to continue. However, an in-the-money qualified covered call suspends the holding period of the stock during the time of the option‚Äôs existence."
03/31/2021,stocks,So why would someone loan the shares from you for $21?  They obviously wouldn't exercise it because it'd cost more then just buying 100 shares at the time (unless it obviously changed) but why would they just loan them in the first place?
03/31/2021,stocks,"Thanks for clarifying yes I‚Äôm say selling and option contract each week, you can go further out if you‚Äôd like. I look at IV to make those decisions"

03/31/2021,stocks,How do you decide what strike to sell covered calls and day timing?
03/31/2021,stocks,Thanks for sharing this! I learned some tax implications I was not aware of!
03/31/2021,stocks,You are selling a call option. One that is covered. The person buying the call option is betting it will hit $11 (As the seller your are betting it does not reach that price) you are not loaning any shares. If the price hits $11 you are giving the person who bought the option contract the right to buy your shares at $11.  If the share price goes up to $15 they are able to exercise the call you sold and buy them for $11 (meaning they make $4 a share minus the premium they paid) and you get paid $11 per share PLUS the premium they paid
03/31/2021,stocks,If the price of BB goes to $20 (or anything more than $11) the person will exercise the option. You just sold your 100 shares to someone for $11 even though the market price is $20. Yeah you got paid a nice premium but was it worth having your shares called away? That‚Äôs why they pay a premium.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I'm selling weeklies right now. So I sell them at the beginning of the week and they expire at the end of the week.

I had a cost basis of $11.05 per share. The first contract was an $11 dollar call, which sold for $10 or .10 per share. That knocked my average down to $10.95, so if the contract executed, I would net 5 bucks.

I followed a similar strategy this week, but was worried about a bump in stock due to earnings (lol), so I did a $12 call for $15. If it executed, I would have received a small profit of ~$120 and completely erased my BB losses.

I'm not sure what this is going to look like next week after this drop in prices. I don't think I'm going to be getting much of a premium for calls where I still break even if they execute, so I may start risking small losses to get a larger premium."

2021-03-31 01:19:12,stocks,"If a stock is heavily shorted (like 100% or close to it), what is stopping one rich person/institution from buying up all of the stock? There is a lot of talk about this shorting situation and how retail investors can ""name their price"" since they are forced to buy the stock back.

If it were that simple, wouldn't it be a no brainer for Berkshire Hatahway to just buy all of the stock of all of the companies that Melvin and others are heavily shorting? They could make a fortune from them."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I think as long as you file paper work on time like 13D/G for 5% stake and follow the rules for 10%+ stake holder and loan restrictions it should be fine.

But I think there's a 6 months cool off period for 10%+ owners from selling, so unless that short squeeze goes for 6 months it'll be over before you can cash out. Unless you want to run the company into profitability to outlast the shorts that's one thing, but if the underlying value of the company is actually nill and is insolvent it's only a matter of time before it bankrupt you lose all your investment."

03/31/2021,stocks,"Rival firms would catch wind and trap you. That's 100% what we're witnessing with AMC and GME. Retail is at a huge disadvantage because we don't get to see the data until a quarter later. However, some excellent freelancers are piecing the story together. From the filings and analyses I've read, there's a compelling case to be made that this is what happened. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard baited Melvin (and Citadel) into over-shorting both stocks, at least twice, from what I can tell. Now they're trapped. 

I talked with a Fidelity rep this morning about the genius of their move, and how Reddit traders are now rushing to transfer their assets into Fidelity. They're loving the influx of new clientele. I didn't even ask, but after pulling up my account and seeing my investments, she told me my shares will never be loaned out. This tells me the sheer volume of this request has led them to train reps to preemptively address this. I asked her about it and she was a little dodgy. Then I asked if they were using this data to decide their next move. No answer, but I could hear her smiling, I swear. I'm convinced that Fidelity is completely aware of the power and leverage they are holding right now."
03/31/2021,stocks,"A better option would be to get 10k people together with each having 10k to spend. This would generate 100,000,000 in purchasing power. 100k people would have 1billion purchasing power. You can then find stocks that are heavily shorted and in unison buy shares in that company forcing a short squeeze. Ideally you would want to control a very large percentage of the stock like 80%. Sec may try to help and say this is market manipulation but really this is just buying based on data points, much like using rsi or candles to buy. It just so happens that the effect is a tightened supply. You could then negotiate as a whole to 5x your money instead of trying to bankrupt the company. This would allow you increase the market cap you could short squeeze by 5x or 10x. 

This could be a very powerful trading strategy if everyone can act in unison. If shorting is legal i dont see why this would be since shorting creates artificial supply."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Once upon a time a guy did that. He even got the certificates sent to him in the mail. He legitimately owned 100% of the shares outstanding. Didn't stop the ""stock"" from trading on the market. It was naked shorted into the ground and he lost it all."

03/31/2021,stocks,"I have a good answer based on my GME experience: the ones shorting can simply continue shorting. This only works in a perfect setting, as is happening in GME.

This is not financial advice."
03/31/2021,stocks,The other thing to consider is that most heavily shorted stocks are shorted for a reason. Nobody wants to throw millions of dollars into a company that doesn't have strong fundamentals. Buying up shares to play a short squeeze is VERY risky. What happens if the short sellers are right? Then you loose big!
03/31/2021,stocks,"idk, but I like the stock."
03/31/2021,stocks,Ryan Cohen kind of did this
03/31/2021,stocks,"The specifics are different for each stock but in order to force a squeeze you usually need to have an absurd amount of capital. Capital that you are putting at risk and as the stock price climbs the risk does too.





A firm could end up dumping a large amount of money in and the price may not move as much as expected. The firm would have to predict the situation of the short sellers well. Can they keep shorts open and for how long? What price did they enter the short? Etc. 





Lets say the purchasing works and now the stock has been squeezed. The firm may not be able to make profit back. They hope that the price increases and they are able to sell enough stock at a good enough price. What if there is not enough demand? What if they sell 25% of what they bought for a profit and that's enough to end the squeeze. They're left holding 75% and potential taking a loss on it. What if long-term investors in the stock see the crazy price and decide to finally offload their holdings which kills the squeeze in the process?







A firm could potentially do what you said but the risk is usually too great. Too many factors and not enough information. But if these market inefficiencies keep happening then a firm will eventually figure out how to do it with relatively little risk and make a killing.







Here's an example that occurs all the time in MMO economies (for example, World of Warcraft). A trader decides to corner a market and buy all the goods to relist at a higher price. It works but at a slow pace. But, before the trader is able to sell off enough goods to profit somebody resets the market and now the price is where it used to be. In order to corner the market the trader had to buy goods at the old market price AND a lot of goods above market price so that the new price made sense in relation to all other orders on the market. So, the trader's average price is higher than the market price and he's fucked due to a higher supply than anticipated. Obviously MMO markets are nowhere near as efficient as the US stock market and you can't short on them but hopefully the point is made. Without a good understanding of how quantity supplied will be altered you take too much risk trying to force a squeeze."
03/31/2021,stocks,"There is only 1 way for GME shorter to get out which is to cover. There‚Äôs nothing they can do now. 

If the price go lower, everyone will just gobble up all the shares. The short interest is already way past 300%. Might even be at 1,000% with all the naked shorting. They are just delaying the inevitable."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Specifically Berkshire focus on long-term investments and not short-term ‚Äúpunts‚Äù. They try to limit risk as much as possible by putting their research into fundamental analysis as opposed to technical. 

Same could be said about other investment firms, who have a duty to their investors to provide returns. 

It‚Äôs simply to risky to ‚Äúfight‚Äù another large firm."
03/31/2021,stocks,Probably the closest to this happening was the 2008 VW squeeze.
03/31/2021,stocks,"it was probably shorted for a reason and in order for you to get a substantial amount of holdings, you would pay a dear price to it.

now assuming you got 100% of a company for a total $100M outlay, well and good - but to who will you sell this to eventually (if you are only there to flip) when the market knows that the intrinsic value of the investment i only $25M.

this is a very simple way of looking at it."

03/31/2021,stocks,I'm guessing the fact they don't have to report their short positions in any semblance of a timely manner makes it hard to tell when it's going down and who does it unless you work at a clearinghouse
03/31/2021,stocks,"Simply, this is not Buffet style investment. His era is done."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I think it has a lot more to do with the fact that they don't have billions in cash.  They would have to liquidate 10, 50, or 100 billion dollars in stocks to fully accomplish this.  While these people and companies are worth hundreds of billions, it is not sitting around in a vault like Scrooge McDuck.  
For example.  According to CNN warren buffett is worth $100 billion.  So he could actually pull something like this off.  But he'd have to sell off and take billions in loses.  And hope to recover before the shorts covered.  And this would likely cause the price to be ran up while he was buying it out to squeeze and start to squeeze him self   Then there is no telling how much is left to squeeze from the hedgies and when he sets the sell price, they'd only have to cover so many shares and the rest would be a lose. It's almost like you'd make 50 billion bit lose 30 in the process, if it works out.  I'd also bet they, at some level, are all in it together.  And don't wanna screw each other that much."

03/31/2021,stocks,"If this were legal they could totally trigger a squeeze, but squeezes need someone to buy the top as well, if there's no natural buyers at the top (shorts have covered) the stock would drop precipitously and they would be stuck with a shit company."
03/31/2021,stocks,"nope, you are stuck with all your gamestop stock. sorry."
03/31/2021,stocks,"So you can, but you can also put the stock into a short squeeze and screw yourself, too. That and when you turn around and try to sell no one else is going to believe the stock is worth any more than when you started.

Why cant BRK notify the SEC, shareholders etc, it seems pretty straight forward to me."
03/31/2021,stocks,"The notification happens after the fact.

It's perfectly reasonable for someone to buy enough of the stock in the market to control the company.

It's not practical, because it will become apparent it's happening and existing holders will tighten up hoping to be paid more as the acquirer gets closer to control and becomes more desperate.

As for the status of shorted shares, when you lend a share to be shorted the voting rights and dividends go with it. The buyer of a share never knows if it's a short share and never needs to. They have the rights to it, and the lender has an IOU, and the short-seller owes them a share.

As the acquisition proceeds the price will rise and the shorts will start to cover, further driving up the price."

Lets word it a different way. I sell a bot that scans the stock market once a day. It picks a stock with the highest shorted position within a target market cap range. At this predetermined time that is programed in. It will buy said stock. It will do this daily until it runs out of money. 
We myst remember the term market manipulation is highly subjective. Technically speaking me buying 1 stock of anything manipulates the market by increasing demand. That manipulation may be extremely small but it still manipulates it."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yes but it is basically what hedge funds do but under the umbrella of one company.  So if these 10k people with $10k formed a company, then it would all be legal under the guidance of the company.  This is basically what a hedge fund is.  Right?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"But If you ever need money for anything, your denied .  It‚Äôs like having a 480 credit score trying to borrow a car .  You have to show you have a ton of money and making a ton too."
03/31/2021,stocks,Beats me. Search for Robert Simpson and Global Links.
03/31/2021,stocks,"When they sell naked shorts they are selling shares that they do not own. They must've lowered the price low enough and long enough that he needed to sell to have capital. They must've been more capable of out waiting him. at least that's my understanding, of what could have happened."
03/31/2021,stocks,"It never happened. It‚Äôs a tall tale based on the true story of Piggly Wiggly. The owner bought up the float. He did not own 100% of the outstanding stock. There were 1,128 shares owned by other parties. The short sellers bought shares from another investor or institution to cover the short.

https://globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis"
03/31/2021,stocks,Search ‚ÄúGlobal Links counterfeit shares‚Äù there‚Äôs a good Forbes article on it.
03/31/2021,stocks,This sounds like the story of the first grocery store where people walked the isles and picked out their own stuff.  I think the owner was pissed about getting shorted and borrowed a ton of money to try to squeeze them.  I think he lost everything he owned in his effort to screw them
03/31/2021,stocks,"Robert Simpson and Global Links in 2005. After looking it up again, it was a million shares and it only cost him a bit over $5k. lol"
03/31/2021,stocks,Made up.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Robert Simpson. The stock was for Global Links Corporation. This happened in 2005. Actually after I looked it up again, it jogged my memory. It was ""only"" a little over $5000 involved for him, but he bought over a million shares of a penny stock, which was the total number of outstanding shares, but the volume was 60 million over the next two days after he secured the entire float."
03/31/2021,stocks,In Europe there's a set amount how much you can short a stock Max. I'm sadly not sure how much it was but I think it was like 50% or 60%. The law got introduced after the VW short squeeze
03/31/2021,stocks,No what your saying makes no sense. It did. VW is a real company
03/31/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs why short interest isn‚Äôt 100% anymore
03/31/2021,stocks,It‚Äôs public info the short interest is like 18% now. Your investing in a garbage company and their is no short squeeze... but good luck. You won‚Äôt need it your fighting gravity it‚Äôs going back to its fundamental value at some point try not to be involved when it does
03/31/2021,stocks,"If it goes to zero is delisted and declared bankruptcy, who cares is what they think."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yes, but once the shorts are covered and there's no one left who is a natural buyer (not covering shorts) at the top of a squeeze the price will come back to earth."
03/31/2021,stocks,"You must consider that if BRK was to buy everything it would certainly skyrocket because when you get that big you actually have the power to move stocks, they push the price because all of the sudden there is massive demand, BKR wants to buy low so buying in one big tranche the MM would make them buy at super high prices, and then when they own all the shares and all the shorts are covered now there is massive supply, if there is no demand at that point well guess what, the stock will drop, now if BKR has the power to push a stock up imagine how hard and fast the stock would drop if they wanted to close their position."
03/31/2021,stocks,And the fine prints says it‚Äôs not the party expenses
03/31/2021,stocks,5% or more requires S-13 filing its a fuck show when shorts attack and wreck a company and can hide behind huge positions
03/31/2021,stocks,what if someone/entity bought a fuck ton of calls?
03/31/2021,stocks,"Dude you're here talking about how things are ""well defined"" as if we are discussing any vagueness. The point is, get this in you and you will understand life better, well-defined or not, if people (hedgefunds or corporates) are gonna find loopholes, they will and they dgaf"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Sure, but hedge funds probably made 100x that in profit. Fines are just a slap on the wrist for them at the level the SEC does them"
03/31/2021,stocks,It's there as a matter of record. People coming upon the ticker in the future will see what happened.
03/31/2021,stocks,I guess I did... Yes I agree Icahn was the bad guy who just wanted to make money.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I've watched every shareholder meeting on YT and read Snowball so safe to say I am a massive fan of Buffett.

WITH THAT BEING SAID

I do love the irony that the name of his company came from an absolutely stupid and emotional purchase. Like literally everything that he cautions against.

Still think he's a genius but I always chuckle to myself about that."
03/31/2021,stocks,Heh.  Learn something new every day!
03/31/2021,stocks,"some companies deserve to be shorted lmfao sears was dying for a while now, shorting is made for those times"
03/31/2021,stocks,fidelity sold all of their gme stocks afaik.
03/31/2021,stocks,"120% of the float was in institutional hands when the short interest was 140%. WSB provided the mob volatility. The big boys just backed up the truck and shoveled in the money.

Whatever's happening now is happening entirely because people don't know what's really happening any more. It's a bunch of drunks milling around after the end of a 3-day music festival, wondering what band is going on next."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Don‚Äôt think they tricked them necessarily but i‚Äôve read some DD on how Blackrock may have been shorting Tesla and Citadel and Melvin squeezed them a little on tesla (presumed to have shorted it since they own like 11 billion worth of oil/coal stocks out there or something so Tesla is a direct threat to these holdings) So as payback they bought a big portion of GME got ryan cohen to buy in (Links between the 2 through Chewy, Blackrock being one of the earliest investors)

03/31/2021,stocks,"According to that, making trades purely to move the price to cause somebody else to trade is a crime.

And no, it doesn't matter what other reasons they have to make the trade."
03/31/2021,stocks,"If it‚Äôs one company then it‚Äôs a single entity. It‚Äôs only coordination when more than one entity is involved. It‚Äôs expected that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing but it‚Äôs a different thing when you coordinate between legal entities.

Yes 10k people could form some kind of fund and invest that way. That‚Äôs what hedge funds are really."
03/31/2021,stocks,So... how does this equate to ‚Äúhe lost it all‚Äù?
03/31/2021,stocks,"In that case it‚Äôs not so much a story of short sellers killing a stock as it is of someone buying an unprofitable business without considering where they‚Äôd get future funding, no?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"The weird thing about it is how did he lose it all. The company can be shorted till the end of time, but if it doesn't have debt and is making money, I dont see where bankruptcy can happen."
03/31/2021,stocks,So is gamestop? It's a worldwide brand
03/31/2021,stocks,It's not 18%. If you think that you are either ignorant or dumb and I don't think yohabr dumb.

03/31/2021,stocks,Nah more like the hedgefunds will just buy up the float and the retail get margin called . Retail doesn‚Äôt have the capital to keep doubling down and pay the short interest
03/31/2021,stocks,"Calls give you the right but not the obligation to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock. 

Because you don't actually own the shares, you don't have to file anything with anyone. Now, if you decide to exercise those calls if they become ITM, and take delivery of those shares, and your stake exceeds a certain %, then you have to report to the SEC."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Marty Lipton built the worlds prestigious corporate lawfirm solely on WLRK‚Äôs ability to combat hostile takeovers. For every hedge fund trying to find a loophole, there‚Äôs a hedge fund on the other side as well trying to make sure it‚Äôs not viable. Stop pretending like institutional investors are some fucking singularity or hive mind that somehow don‚Äôt fight each other.

The buying (in a manner which created a change of control event) is one of the most litigated topics in US history. It‚Äôs pretty easy to find precedents that stop people from doing something that hasn‚Äôt been done before in that space."
03/31/2021,stocks,This. Fines are starting to become just a cost in doing business. They need to make it so that fines take away all of the profits gotten by the illegal act and then add additional punishment for it to be truly respected.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yes, fate loves the irony"

03/31/2021,stocks,"Retail absolutely creates the volatility. The book doesn't need 100 million shares to cross to tick up. One share at a time will do, and the size of the tick is arbitrary depending only on what the person who entered the sell limit order thinks they can get.

The institutions that ~~Merlin~~Marvin had sold the short shares to just sat back listening to the phone ringing, and watched the price go up. Then they allowed ~~Merlin~~Marvin to cover.

They are not exciting stocks their price doesn‚Äôt move to much historically. However when you buy the stock have the dividends reinvested than over time you see the magic  of compounding interest. There is an legend that Albert Einstein said compounding interest was the most powerful force in the universe. Not sure I believe it‚Äôs an actual quote , but it does get the message across.

03/31/2021,stocks,Yup I bought KHC a few weeks ago. Had to get out of growth stocks a bit. Looked at some charts of divi stocks and said if buffet believes then I‚Äôll give it a shot.

03/31/2021,stocks,"Hyperinflation requires a lot more than government simply printing money. The USG has been printing

03/31/2021,stocks,"So you see a world where Tesla doesn't grow more and it goes under?

Tesla might be over valued but it ain't failing like a dot com company in 2000s."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Agree!  MSFT was in a better place in 2000 than TSLA is now and may ever be.  However, more generally I believe that some of the horribly high valued companies will be hated once a crash occurs and they'll likely trade sideways for years ... But will come back ... I will try and buy the survivors after a good period of observation"

03/31/2021,stocks,I hate to break it to you but Buffet will not be alive in 20 years.
03/31/2021,stocks,There is going to be no crash. That is my point.
03/31/2021,stocks,i thought they were grouped together because they‚Äôre all tech? DIS has tech elements but theyre not a tech company
03/31/2021,stocks,"should be FAANNG, add Nvidia"
03/31/2021,stocks,And take out nflx add MSFT and Nvidia
03/31/2021,stocks,"There's a difference. AMZN was controlling a huge share of the retail market for years and had no real competitor. It simply chose to put the money back into growth and not record a ""profit"" for many years.

TSLA is not really in the same boat. It only controls a tiny portion of the auto-market and its dominance of EV is already starting to shrink. I'm not really sure where people think it will go from here."
03/31/2021,stocks,"unless teslas ""stabilizes"" itself into selling 50 million cars a year, its overpriced. and that aint gonna happen. dont believe the hype."
03/31/2021,stocks,Yeah.  He will learn the hard way one day.
03/31/2021,stocks,"What if the only thing they ever become and succeed at is cars and batteries? What if their future business ideas don't prove economically viable, or they fail? You do realize pipeline companies fail all the time. It's pretty naive to assume everything they say they will do will become a success.

Or let's say they are in between and they do 7x the sales they do now.  So you think 70b a quarter makes them worth trillions?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"It's absolutely a mistake on your WeBull then, no need for a screenshot you can search the entire web in many ways and see that it never hit .09

03/31/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôm not touching Tesla bc I think it‚Äôs insanely overpriced. But, if I had to bet on any new company to become the next Amazon, Google, Netflix, etc I‚Äôd bet on Tesla. Is it likely? Probably not. 

20 years ago they were talking about how ridiculous it is that Amazon, an online bookstore, has a larger market cap than Sears. And they‚Äôd need to sell every book in existence to justify their stock price."
03/31/2021,stocks,His comment was the funniest thing I‚Äôve read in a while wew lad
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yes and that‚Äôs what the market, or at least some participants, expects it to do in the future. 

Whether or not that happens is irrelevant. You shouldn‚Äôt bother comparing current earning metrics for growth companies as that suggests Tesla is at the same stage of their lifecycle as Amazon."
03/31/2021,stocks,Facts. It‚Äôs always justified with the one or two behemoths that rose to the top
03/31/2021,stocks,Who would buy a stock because they thought it would go down? Isnt the whole point of the exercise for it to go up unless you‚Äôre short?
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yea sure they might but the issue is they are already the 5th or 6th largest company in the world. Prop tret tesla itself as a small growth company and that is true, problem is everyone treats it as such and now all that growth is priced in. Look at cisco from dot com, don't compare tesla to apple or Amazon in 2000 because Amazon and apple had market caps under 10b, tesla has a market cap of 600b the two are absolutely not comparable."
03/31/2021,stocks,The irony here is that Elon told everyone Tesla cars are appreciating assets
03/31/2021,stocks,Not really. They are more in the lifecycle of yahoo in the really 2000s
03/31/2021,stocks,People should take into consideration this thing called ‚Äúthe competition‚Äù. that projection would be true if no other car company was allowed to make evs.
03/31/2021,stocks,"It is,  there are just more people than you realize  who only have a single."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yes but a stock should have some fundamental reason why its going up, if it only goes up cause of hype, if belief that it will go up is the sole reason why people are buying its a self fulfilling prophecy that drives the price up. As soon as people start to lose excitement the price cannot be maintained and it crashes down.

im not saying you cant make money in a bubble, but that doesnt change that it is one, and u should know when to leave the ship."
03/31/2021,stocks,You think Tesla now is where Yahoo was in the late 2000s in terms of their lifecycle?
03/31/2021,stocks,"Saying you guys aren't intelligent enough to put a proper valuation on it isn't saying that he reinvented the wheel- that's your ego speaking. A foolish man thinks himself wise, a wise man knows himself to be a fool. 

Tesla is worth whatever the market deems it is worth, not what some fool on reddit says. It's never overvalued or undervalued- it's worth exactly what the market deems it is worth.  Is a Da Vinci painting really worth $200 million if no one is willing to pay for it? Is it still worth $200 million if people are willing to pay more? The market decides what it is worth, just like  tesla. 

Are you actually buying long puts on it or are you just here on reddit bashing something you're too afraid to bet against?  Truly interested- I've been considering buying calls whenever it nears $500 and puts whenever it nears $700- not because of math but bc that appears to be the floor and ceiling rn, and if biden shoves some green legislation through I'd prob ride the tesla overreaction on the way up and the way down too. I'm just here to try to turn a profit and I'm more interested in what positions people are willing to invest in."
03/31/2021,stocks,Yes.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Lol by that definition there is no such thing as a bubble. And there is such thing as over or undervalued, u need to compare a car company to other car companies not monalisa, than u can easily see if its overvalued or undervalued. This kind of talk is typical of a tesla buyer and musk fan boys, and its typical of bubble mania, nonsense justifications for nonsense valuations."
03/31/2021,stocks,I hope you don‚Äôt invest your own money...
03/31/2021,stocks,I would buy Tesla at around 150$ to 200$ range were it belongs. Tesla gets the bonus for the good battery management and efficient motors. They lack capacity and build quality.
03/31/2021,stocks,My point was solely about Tesla‚Äôs lifecycle and how it shouldn‚Äôt be valued based on today‚Äôs earnings. You could be correct about it‚Äôs fair value.
03/31/2021,stocks,"The thing is that the competition caught up way too fast. The only groundbreaking thing Tesla has going for them is the battery management.
Europe, Korea and Japan are really racist ( lack of better word) towards foreign cars. China will try to steal the tech and squeeze foreign carmakers out of the market. Musk said they will try to ramp up to 20 million cars per year. I think this is way off."
2021-03-31 01:10:10,stocks,"Volkswagen - a TESLA for the Elon Musk hater Are you annoyed by Elon Musk's success at moving markets with a tweet? Do you feel down because you missed out on TSLA gains, as you were absolutely sure this company is an overvalued bubble?

Volkswagen is the company for you. With an army of paid reporters moving around any propaganda (as per German specialty) they are spoon-fed, like:

a) announcements about ""aiming"" to overtake Tesla, without relevant capacity or plans to put it in place,

b) ""verified"" name-changing to Voltswagen (insert heavy cringe here), quickly ""unverified"" the next day ([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-name/volkswagen-will-not-change-name-of-u-s-operations-sources-idUSKBN2BM2YJ?il=0](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-name/volkswagen-will-not-change-name-of-u-s-operations-sources-idUSKBN2BM2YJ?il=0))

This is your opportunity to ride the wave of 2-nd best, with pure marketing-based crap fueling the pump this time!

Not far lies the moment another ""verified"" source will leak the readiness of VW to release Deutsch Self-Driving using patented brainwave technology, making vision-based FSD obsolete before it's even released!"
03/31/2021,stocks,"The Next Tesla, Volkswagen, *Das Auto*, already overtook Tesla in Europe and *will* become the world's biggest consumer EV maker in two years or less.

Today accelerated this!  Tesla is facing a lithium shortage.  VW secured lithium agreements as late as last year.

I'm not shorting Tesla.  I just think that VW has *way* more upside at this point, to the tune of $1.1 trillion market cap or more by 2025, than Tesla does.

[And I think even Tesla short Michael Burry underestimates VW's upside potential.]"
03/31/2021,stocks,"After VW had to pay $25 BILLION in fines for falsifying emission date, do you really want to put your money on this pony?"
03/31/2021,stocks,You got humor. We will see. I would only bet on VW short term like OP said. They are too far behind. Tesla will be the future.

03/31/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't even go near their ""EV""s

They'll probably make ICUs and sell them with an EV sticker until they get caught AGAIN."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Hah! My point exactly, nobody in the reddit crowd gives a crap about VW.

It's just an opportunity for Tesla shorts to have a seemingly backed argument for contesting its dominance at last."

2021-03-31 01:00:38,stocks,"Buy shares across the Atlantic There seems to be not only a rotation from growth to value stocks at the moment, but also one across the Atlantic. The DAX has again reached a high of 15000 points today. German shares are in contrast to American still relatively cheap. Also, unlike the U.S., there is no need to fear inflation in the euro area (the ECB could never raise interest rates here in the next five years) because the economy here is not yet running at full speed. 

An example of this would be that the Volkswagen share has risen sharply in recent weeks, mainly due to higher interest from American investors. Also, an American would have earned a 10% return last year just from currency effects if they had held European stocks. 

So my question therefore to the Americans among you: Do you have your eye on European stocks? Can you trade them? There are definitely interesting companies in Europe that you can still buy at a reasonable price. And for us Europeans it is quite natural to look around the US market (probably more than in Europe)."

2021-03-31 00:24:19,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 30, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, March 30, 2021**

The broader market finished lower following another volatile session, but interestingly, many individual stocks that were beaten down in recent weeks surged. Market participants continue to digest the sudden unwinding in stocks by a large hedge fund and an elevated Treasury yield.

Yesterday, Bloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management‚Äôs family office and a so-called ‚ÄúTiger cub‚Äù (the name Wall Street gave to prot√©g√©s of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a ‚Äúsignificant hit‚Äù following Archegos Capital‚Äôs margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can't, the broker will dump the client's shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.

Despite the fear stemming from Archegos‚Äô margin call, new data shows encouraging signs that the economy is recovering.  In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last week‚Äôs unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. Looking ahead, the March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The report is estimated[ to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html) in March ‚Äî the most since October 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic.

However, concerns from market participants remained centered on the pace of economic recovery. With the recent passage of more stimulus and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs commitment to maintaining accommodative policies in place for the foreseeable future may cause a rapid spike in inflation.

So that type of statement is even more limiting that you're thinking; you would likely have up to one industry that you can look at that way, and for many people it is none. A few people who are super nerds and read a lot and don't socialize very much might understand two or three industries, especially if they spent a lot of time as some sort of business consultant.

In my opinion, it is important to consider both the efficient market hypothesis, and the behavioral market hypothesis. Neither is correct, because they're both partially accurate, and separating out how to balance them is not a solved problem. But according to the efficient market hypothesis, whatever is in the books is already priced in. Which actually implies that it might not be as important to read it as people say. Except that, we know that isn't true; for one thing, every person that doesn't read it and assumes it is priced in is trading on the behavioral side, and reducing the efficiency!

So the art is actually to find something in the books that matters, that not everybody would notice. That's why people emphasize reading and understanding the cashflow statements. You'll see details that don't show up in all the ratios. And lots of people, most people even, don't read any of that, they only look at the ratios. But probably 90% of the time, you won't actually find anything interesting there. But when you do, you'll have a leg up on the behavioralists. üëº"
03/31/2021,stocks,"With technical analysis (studying the charts and using indicators, etc) you can trade a stock and not even know the name or what it really does. Now you can also pair technical analysis with a little bit of DD just to have some more information to go off of.

Fundamental analysis in my opinion is more for the longer term buy and hold type mentality (technical charts you can setup for long term plays as well). Getting into the fundamentals of a company I feel takes a lot longer to evaluate a single company. 

Technical analysis I can pop through 10 different charts in 30 minutes and find a couple decent plays to watch depending on what strategy I want to employ.

So long answer to the fact you DO NOT need to know a company well to invest in it and be successful."

2021-03-30 22:46:06,stocks,"How do I short the automobile finance industry? I see too many people I know that are driving around with vehicles I believe they cant afford. They have bought the vehicles in the last year due to covid unemployment benefits and stimulus packages. A family of 5 just got a $7000 stimulus check. When this faucet shuts off, it'll be tough for some to keep up with their car payments.

Car loans used to be 3-5 years, now I see some drawn out 10 or more, most are over 5 I'm guessing, with barely anyone taking on the 36 month payments. Doesn't seem right. 

I get the argument that cars are holding their value longer these days.

I also understand the concept of being able to live in a car, but not able to drive a house. 

So is there something here?

Are there auto financing backed securities that can be shorted? Are there bonds that contain these companies loans? Can we dig?

How healthy is gmac, wfaf, coaf, etc etc?

Hopefully someone smarter than me can tell me how wrong I am?

Edit 1: How come everyone is saying household debt went down and savings increased without providing any reasoning for the shift?

Maybe there is a weighted average? What is the standard deviation on these claims?

03/31/2021,stocks,"There's no way that I can think of to short the auto loans. The finance company holds the car as collateral, so if the buyer misses the payments, then the car gets repossessed by the finance company and sold off at an auction to recoup their loss. The finance company then writes off the loss and gets a tax break. Note that these loans do not have an insurance like mortgages, and most of the time are offered at zero money down on a depreciating asset.

The shady buy here pay here dealers purchase most of the reposessed cars from auction. They notoriously sell cars to subprime borrowers, repo the car, then sell it again to the next victim to rinse and repeat.

Some of these shady dealers sell the sub-prime uncollectibles to collection companies for pennies on the dollar. Then collections companies continuously harass the sub prime borrowers until they get paid. 

One way to capitalize on this situation is to get a dealer's license and start buying these repossesed cars from auctions.

I met a guy who would buy the repossessed luxury brand cars at auctions then sell them on eBay and overseas as a side hustle. He had his own team of mechanics to fix the cars, and still made a decent profit."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I used to sell cars and from my experience, most people that get financed through the major manufacturers banks (ex. Toyota Financial, Ford Credit, etc.) have to have at least decent credit and they make sure that they don‚Äôt approve anyone if the car payment will skew their income to debt ratio to where they cannot afford it. People can also get loans from their own banks whether local or national such as Wells Fargo, these guys do make risky loans sometimes but it takes work to get them approved. Lots of credit unions also make these loans to car buyers but usually these people have a good standing with their credit union. I have only seen sub-prime customers get approved by banks that apparently don‚Äôt mind the high risk. One such bank I noticed did a lot of these loans was Santander. They would approve people with FICO scores below 550 and people no social security numbers, and people with sketchy proof of income. Of course the interest rates for these are astronomical for a car loan, most averaging in the 20-30% range (for real!). Anyway I don‚Äôt know if there is one single bank that finances all the car loans but it seems it is basically any bank. But you might have some luck shorting the shady bank stocks (based on my experience) like Santander. There were a few others that I‚Äôve worked with but they were much smaller local banks, which I don‚Äôt even remember their names. Consider all this information along with the fact that I stopped selling cars in 2018 so maybe things have changed."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I work in auto finance.  Trust me when I tell you that any good auto lender is reserved for possible losses on risky loans.  Their financials will not be impacted that greatly.  Especially since they're making huge money on every car they put through the wholesale marketplace. Wholesale prices for used cars are ridiculously high due to the shortage of new cars caused by the automotive chip shortage.  Those risky loans you mentioned are covered by higher interest rates, higher down payments, etc.  Loan delinquency was higher in 2018 than they were during the 2009 recession but  you didn't see finance companies hurting."

The payments are breaking them or will break them in the short future. Also several have plans to buy a new car when they pay off their old used one, jumping from a 3k car to a 30k+ car. They're also being told by car salesmen that it's easier/cheeper/better for them to get a loan on a brand new car rather then a used one. Reminds me of those 2 jabronis in the bar in the big short.

*to add, me personally, couldn't afford a new car, or smart enough not to get suckered into it. So I repair my old car myself which makes me like the suggestions of investing in autoparts stores. I had spare time during last year, so I learned how to fix my own car easily online."

03/31/2021,stocks,"Not exactly. I have some prior experience with one of these before. It‚Äôs a cash flow game and securitization plays a role. Repoing cars isn‚Äôt going to save them money if there are widespread defaults. They sell the cars in blocks at auction basically. But they could effectively do this multiple times. Depending on the car, they can lose value very quickly. The bigger question becomes cash flow and whether they can keep going to market with these securitized notes. It‚Äôs the same idea as with the MBS‚Äô everyone is referencing in this thread. 

All that said, it is harder than people think for these industries to see losses and their portfolios wind across years. Basically they‚Äôd need widespread defaults in such an extent that the interest on the portfolio doesn‚Äôt cover their financing costs (its late and I‚Äôm blanking on all the terms). Any repo‚Äôd cars would then have a tough market to sell into. Oddly enough, their were more struggles in this place a few years ago because people were doing too well and the interest rate market was too competitive.

2. for some reason (still unsure and somewhat unknown) Archegos was hit with a margin call (rumored to be around $6bn see CNBC article [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/wall-street-reels-from-archegos-fire-sale-with-questions-on-regulation.html))
3. Archegos defaulted on their margin call and as a result liquidated their fund
4. The total value of equity exposure was around $20bn
5. A fire sale began in the stocks that were the underlying security in the total return swap
6. Banks were forced to sell their position in large block trades
7. Credit Suisse is rumored to have taken a multibillion dollar hit (also on the heel of Greensill), Goldman and Morgan Stanley liquidated greater than $10bn worth of shares, Nomura is said they will take a hit on an undisclosed US client who owed them $2bn, Mitsubishi UBJ is rumored to have taken a $300m

If you want a more visual example plus how total return swaps you can check this slide deck that I have made on the topic

03/31/2021,stocks,My question is...why wouldn‚Äôt other institutions immediately pick up these shares at a discounted price. Why sell these to the open market? Why not try and sell your position to another hedge fund or institution at a slight discount?

But sadly, that‚Äôs how most of the ‚ÄòTiger Cubs‚Äô as they‚Äôre known built their fortunes. 

This has to be one of the quickest losses of a mega fortune in history. üò≤"
03/31/2021,stocks,"The hedge part is what confuses me. When this first broke through WeChat, there were several other banks listed fronting this with swaps. So some group of banks lent whatever the original amount was then another group of banks were also involved in the equity swap portion that allowed him to get wildly leveraged. I may be mistaken (this news broke really early in the morning US time so it was hard to follow), but it sounded like MS, GS, Credit Suisse, and I guess Normura were the ones in the original syndication. Somehow deutsche bank, WFC, JPM, and probably others ended up on the swap side. 

Now originally, they were going to unwind the position slowly so there wasn‚Äôt much volatility or losses. I‚Äôm not an expert in equity swaps, so I‚Äôm not sure how just that it was gonna be slower. It sounds like one or two of these banks broke rank. The rumor was GS sold off before the others, so it took minimal losses. Now this was something I saw the night of, but JPM might have front run them all and started dumping its swaps into the market and on other banks knowing it was going to crash. If so, that‚Äôs somewhat similar to what they did in ‚Äò07-‚Äò08 and while it saves them face, it destabilizes everything as we saw. It doesn‚Äôt surprise me Deutsche and WFC said they didn‚Äôt suffer any losses, whether that‚Äôs true or not is to be determined and quite possibly they may have lost the equivalent of paper gains, but their risk profiles in the equity space are significantly lower than a JPM or GS. 

It‚Äôll be interesting to see what comes out of this. If the GS and JPM rumors are true, I doubt anything comes of it, but there‚Äôs a slight chance they could face serious repercussions. They‚Äôre constantly the two names involved in market volatility and having this kinda exposure on the IB side doesn‚Äôt align with what they‚Äôre reporting their risk appetite is and puts into question what their actual risk is on the commercial side."
03/31/2021,stocks,Goldman Sachs was also involved in the secondary offerings.
03/31/2021,stocks,"What I don‚Äôt get is that none of the publicized holdings dropped that much. Even VIAC after the announcement only retreated to its March 3 price. Surely he was in that position before March and had sizable gains from his leveraged position‚Äîstock was up 400% since last April.  Even his less liquid holdings like GSX is only back to its Jan price right now‚Äîafter the block trade dump.

Seriously, someone explain to me like I‚Äôm 5 years old."

03/31/2021,stocks,Yeah I don't get it man. Unless he bought viac and disca at the top.  They started at like the mid teens right?  He can't be dumb enough to buy in huge at 100 for viac.  Guys been trading for 20+ years.  Must be something else or some other tickers involved with the margin call.  Was options involved?  That could really kill you.
03/31/2021,stocks,Someone else mentioned that Goldman loaded up on puts.
03/31/2021,stocks,"First off I don't know if they are trading at a discount and it comes down to where you think the valuation is. The second thing is that we don't know if the selling is done all we know is that MS told clients they were done. There could be other institutions who still want to unload. There is almost no way for anyone to be certain, especially now because now people can have equity exposure without having the equity. For someone to say ""selling is done"" they would have to know all the market participants intentions. Also ""picking up shares at a discounted price"" is a very retail-like approach to trading. Most funds can't jump into trades like that its not in their mandates, and the ones that do wouldn't jump in with this little amount of knowledge."

03/31/2021,stocks,"Damn. I hadn‚Äôt heard of JPM having been involved yet. I also haven‚Äôt done reading on any talks that were had between the banks beforehand. 

Do they sign anything or is it just spit-and-a-handshake (and fingers crossed behind the back)?"
03/31/2021,stocks,"You're correct that the initial announcement of $VIAC secondary offering brought the stock back down to March 3rd levels around $70. When Archegos went under and the banks started dumping then it crashed through to where it was sitting in late January. 

I'm sure Hwang hadn't just opened these positions, but if he's playing with options contracts/total return swaps then a drop from $100 to $70 can absolutely destroy an options contract. Hwang was collecting the returns from these options contracts and the returns went negative FAST.

Archegos was ridiculously over-leveraged in these positions and the underlying stock dropped 30%, and that's JUST $VIAC."
03/31/2021,stocks,"The parabolic motion on both of those stocks makes it look like what was happening was that he was causing it. It kept going up because he was trading it so big. And he kept trading it so big because it kept going up.

But I see elsewhere that he wasn't actually trading real equity, he was trading some sort of derivatives. It is still very odd that both Viacom and Discovery followed the same parabolic curve over several months."

03/31/2021,stocks,"You've probably seen other comments, but just to be sure, some of their positions were leveraged 5-6x. And once one thing gets called, the excess saps margin being used to back the others. And, if you wait and let the bank do the selling, they don't finesse it to try to leave something in the bottom of the drawer. They let it get messy."
03/31/2021,stocks,VIAC announced a share offering which blew up the price the morning of the margin call
03/31/2021,stocks,"He bid that fucker all the way up, levered all the way to the hilt nuts deep the whole time. 

I bet he was using index put options to hedge himself. Then he got whacked by 1) VIAC share offering 2) VIAC downgrayed 3) Bad news knocking down his Chinese education stocks 4) Market did not tank so his hedge didn't print.

Basically a perfect storm to BTFO."
03/31/2021,stocks,Don‚Äôt mess with GS. They‚Äôll give you all the leverage and short you at the same time!
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I‚Äôm having trouble sorting through it all to figure out who exactly is involved also. JPM might end up having been clean of this. When the news first dropped GS, MS, and JPM were the names listed all over wechat and everyone was shitposting those names, including myself tbh, because it was hilarious and reminiscent of their roles in 2008 all over again. There were also like 4 or so hedge funds listed with Hwang‚Äôs being the obviously largest. JPM definitely shopped blocks of these China based stocks and was one of the first to do so. Not sure how or why they‚Äôd have done that without being in the know. It fits their MO within the market though.

As far as your second point, I‚Äôd figure it has to be a handshake agreement. Banks aren‚Äôt allowed to collude on their positions if they entered individually. Now if GS fucked the syndication over, then it could be interesting unless they had like first lien on the stocks or something. I have never seen anything like this happen."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Sure. If you go 10:1 on leverage and the price drops 20% you will get called. But that‚Äôs only for the price dropping 20% below your entry price.

So for this, it just doesn‚Äôt add up.
Say he entered a position 10x leveraged at $50. So he put up $5 in capital for the position. Price goes up to $100.  He‚Äôs is $55 clear now.  Now the price drops 20% to $80. He‚Äôs still $30 clear of his entry price and the margin requirement. He‚Äôs only get called if the price dropped 55% which would wipe out his margin deposit.

He must have been using rolling gains into the same/similar positions. So while it looks like 10:1 at the final trade which collapses, is it more like 100:1 once you roll it back?"

03/31/2021,stocks,I saw somewhere that they actually gave him a week to come up with the money. But maybe it was just fuzzy reporting.

03/31/2021,stocks,They were yoloing their bonuses on random options.
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yeah I'm just really fascinated by the whole thing. It seems to me like Archegos saw the writing on the wall and called the banks together during the day on Thursday to try and hammer out a deal to unwind the positions safely in the market. 

WSJ reported the phone call ended ""without any hard agreements"" and I'm sure that the banks went and looked at those positions right after that call to assess the damage. 

Upon realizing the extent of the damages, Goldman says ""fuck this"" and starts panic selling the Hwang securities. Chaos ensues, Credit Suisse gets bent over again by Goldman and retail sits by with the popcorn. 

I've never seen anything like this before either. It's ruthless out there."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Without having access to his exact trades, we'll never know exactly how it went down. 

I think the idea you had of rolling gains probably did leverage his leverage, but I think it also had the added effect of boosting his cost basis. 

Sure, he may have entered into a position for the first time at $50 but if he's rolling his options forward and re-investing his gains into the same concentration of stocks ***using margin***, then any sort of margin call from your broker is going to ruin you. 

If I enter into a position 10x leveraged at $50 then I've invested $5. Say my call at the $75 strike is close to expiry and I want to roll it forward because it's going up and I want to continue to collect premium.

I have to pay to roll the contract forward. Rolling forward a 10x leveraged position at $75 is going to hypothetically cost me $7.50. That's 50% higher than my initial investment. Where do I get the capital to roll the option forward? The gains I've collected on the option up to this point, which I just used 90% leverage to get. 

He rolled his options forward with money that wasn't his - the banks called to ask for it back, and Hwang only had the ""$5"" he used to open the position."

>synth equity  

>5-6x leverage

Shit like this hidden behind the curtain is how 2008 got out of control.

The current known level of margin debt is ATH, but there's plenty that is unknown in both size and leverage, and a lot of it is on positions made of bucket-shop vapor that amplifies the reaction to volatility even further.

Hopefully today other traders are quietly unwinding their most stretched positions to prevent similar margin calls, but history shows that people rarely think that calamity they see happening others could happen to them."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Of course not, if you new anything you would know things are distribute, usually normally. doesn't matter if there are 10 or 1000 exactly like him or not. Don't be a moron. You are trying to pretend that because he is unique this means there is nothing close, that is just moronic. Please don't be a moron. Do I have to explain it? Seem, maybe he was the biggest(so far) but 10 others 1/10 of his size = him. Chances are there are 10 others 1/10th his size is almost 100%. Then there is 100 that are 1/100, and so on."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yep, the margin call itself happened likely on Monday and I suspect GS was the first to make the call after which Hwang probably asked his other counterparties for margin relief at which point they learned he might be pressured/in trouble. There was a Wednesday call between 6 of the major pb's. CS tried to get agreement for an orderly and coordinated unwinds. GS pulled the trigger with a default notice Thursday night.

First to unwind is always the one that avoids the heaviest losses. My guess is CS and Nomura were late on the margin call or had longer cure periods and were last to try unloading."
03/31/2021,stocks,I assumed one can have a say in what to sell to restore their balance.
03/31/2021,stocks,"The margin call is stipulated in the contracts, they didn't just surprise him with it."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I think you must have it right there, but it‚Äôs a subtlety left out of the news articles. It makes leveraged trading in general look bad. It‚Äôs like short selling, both are extremely useful and good for the markets when risks are properly managed. And maybe that‚Äôs exactly what happened here‚Äîthe dealer brokers covered their losses before any systemic issues arose."
03/31/2021,stocks,">Shit like this hidden behind the curtain is how 2008 got out of control.

It's not hidden behind the curtain. The big banks do a fuck ton of reporting to the Fed regarding their capital hit. Synth exposure, even fully internalized, still hits them with reg cap requirements not to mention XVA traders can offload significant portions of counterparty exposure to avoid systemic contagion.

> The current known level of margin debt is ATH, but there's plenty that is unknown in both size and leverage, and a lot of it is on positions made of bucket-shop vapor that amplifies the reaction to volatility even further. 

I don't know where to begin. That's just... flat out fantasy? You get into more opaque swap structures in debt (mainly because the assets are less fungible) but synth equity is about as vanilla and transparent (to regulators) as it gets. Global Equity Derivs groups can get into some messier things like equity linked notes where the exposure is harder to hedge (vega, etc), but that's not the bread and butter of flow swaps or D1 groups that Archegos was trading through."

03/31/2021,stocks,"I didn't mean the SEC couldn't see it. I meant the curtain between the public and that data. As in CNBC doesn't have a daily wrap-up of trading in swaps, CDOs, etc. If you put this stuff on the TV daily, people would be more cautious as the market gets more top-heavy. Which of course is why they don't put it on the TV daily."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Maybe I'm not trying to get a point across? It's clear someone doesn't want to have a discussion about why they are wrong so why should I invest any real time to explain to them when they most likely still wouldn't understand even if they wanted?

Peorth literally is trying to do everything to justify his concept that there is just one case and no others because they are not the same. That is moronic. It shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how the universe works and a lack of example after example of how the distribution of objects in the universe are, well, distributed. It shows a lack of basic mathematical aptitude of proportions and density. What it ultimately shows is a lack of intelligence and knowledge. Like most people, they know it all already and won't do anything to learn anything new. They have it all figured out.

&#x200B;

Literally the statement

"" This was apparently the largest margin call in history. Unprecedented. That means, not the same as 1000 other things. ""

Shows just how dump Peorth is. S/He literally said that shit. That because it is the largest margin call in history, lets assume, that somehow end of discussion cause nothing else matters. As if no other potential cases could possibly come close or if there are several that are medium size and just waiting to fall tomorrow. Basically end of discussion, everything else is irrelevant because ""it's not the same thing as 1000 others"" as if it actually has to be. It really shows a lack of of the ability to abstract which is basically a lack of mathematical ability and that leads in to a whole host of intellectual shortcomings.

So, I really don't care, and I'm sure you actually don't care either. But I will call out people who say stupid shit because maybe one day it will dawn on them that they are not as intelligent as they think and will try to learn something."

Elon is making random decisions that I am not sure how will ends up. I feel like his focus is shifting. 

WVAGY is taking off, Im not sure if it is a good replacement for TSLA or not. But it feels like it is  serious . Im looking long terms like 1-2 years investment. Is this german company going to take over the TSLA? I know some people say TSLA vs Volkswagen is like Apple vs Samsung. 
well, samsung isn't that bad overall IMO...
some brokers have not added Volkswagen to their stocks yet (e.g. I cannot trade in on webull, but I can on Robinhood). But I think Volkswagen is just starting, it can have a good ride up plus cars is what they do.

2021-03-30 22:21:49,stocks,"[DEGIRO] Set stop loss and Take profit I was wondering Why I can not set a SL and TP in DEGIRO and came across this [old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/az40hc/degiro_how_to_create_order_with_stop_loss_and/). And I have a few questions.

I began doing FOREX with meta trader, and there once you have a position, you can set a SL and TP to exit the position. 

Now in DEGIRO I have an open position, but I do not find a way of placing both SL and TP for one position, why is it not possible? If I have a BUY position, to take profits I place a SELL STOP LOSS at a Higher price than my current position, and that would act as TP would act on meta trader. 

But I can not do it the other way around, why is that? I would also like to place another SELL Order below my current position to cut potential loses. 

Also, in the post I linked, someone mentioned:

> Stop losses are good ways to lose your money. I never use them.

How can that be true? As far as I know and have read, they are there to protect you from big loses. 

Hope it is not a too dummy question."

This may not seem like much, but remember that these are all local highs. My advice would be to sit out for a week. Wait and see how the Nasdaq reacts to 13000, if it even manages to push for it this week.

People who had reasonable mortgages and were responsible in making monthly payments were fine for the most part. And are still living in houses that have increased a fair bit in value since then. 

Could any one individual have lost their home? Sure lots of people lost jobs and wealth etc. But those who were most exposed and over-extended lost the most.

Look at the statistics every now and then. More than 50% day traders lose money. Most short term traders do not make money consistently. The key word here is consistency. 

Don‚Äôt day trade for a living. Your best bet is to take statistics/economics courses and if your mathematical skills are up to par, perhaps take a course in quantitative finance. If you don‚Äôt feel ready, read Bloomberg/Wall Street Journal to get a feel of the finance industry or literally capitalism(learn about corporate deals/macroeconomic trends/ finance terms). Easy and fun activity. 

Trading should be fun and not taken too seriously. However, it helps to be educated and informed. Try to stay away from WSB if your focus is to stay consistent.

03/31/2021,stocks,"Under the rule, what qualifies as a ‚Äúsubstantially similar‚Äù stock? That seems incredibly ambiguous"
2021-03-30 20:04:00,stocks,"How does buying a stock on an IPO day work? Example:

* Company IPOs at $10 a share
* I buy 1000 shares (through Fidelity)
* price goes to $20 over the day

Will I have bought at $10 or at $20 or somewhere in between (I.E. How long does Fidelity take to buy the shares)?

Can I pre-register with fidelity to buy them at $10 the second the market opens?

It seems like it's a big deal to wait even a few hours given how volatile IPOs tend to be on day 1."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I got in on the IPO day for a company through Fidelity once, I don't remember which one. Basically it was announced as being $12. There was no pre market trading, as it was an IPO. However, the normal pre market bidding still applies. So I put my initial bid in at $12.25 thinking it would be bid up much, much higher and the MM would open the price at $13+ which is what happened. 

The IPO is announced as being offered at $X. Before the open, anyone that wants to buy on the open puts their orders in. On the open, if you're bid is close enough to the initial ask price and volume is there, your bid is executed and the 1000 shares are yours, at $10 per your example. If at 3pm the shares are trading at $20, you're up $10k. 

From the IPOs I've watched, generally there is a huge bid up above the announced IPO price and above what the pre IPO shares were sold for, then the pre IPO shares are dumped at a large profit and the share price drops. I've never heard of pre IPO shares getting locked up for anyone but people affiliated with the company, but I could be wrong. IPOs are basically just a way for the millionaires and people who are otherwise legally allowed to purchase pre IPO to make quick money. 

Imagine investing $1M in a company at $10 pre IPO and on IPO day that shit hitting $50. Easy $5M. That's why it's easier to make money when you have money. 

To register to invest pre IPO you need one of a number of licenses, have an annual income over $300k (or $250k I can't remember) or have a liquid net worth of over $1M. There is a minimum investment of $10k from what I remember. I don't remember seeing anything about a lockout period, I don't think there'd be much interest if you risked the company's shares going to half value within a month and you just have to eat it. Rich investors aren't rich because they're dumb.  There's a number of companies that facilitate pre IPO sales. Check em out. 

Maybe some of these meme stock paper millionaire's can get in on some pre IPO naked long calls.

Edit: math is hard yo"

03/31/2021,stocks,"Sorry, can you help me understand this? If you make say 50k in realized profits, then sell another stock at 50k loss you owe no taxes?

If you sold at a 25k loss you‚Äôd only owe taxes on 25k?"
03/31/2021,stocks,But back in on a different brokerage.  Loophole!
03/31/2021,stocks,What‚Äôs a wash sale?
03/31/2021,stocks,PLTR
03/31/2021,stocks,"Correct, only if you don't rebuy the same shares within 30 days before or after the sale. If it's +/- 31 days it's all good"
03/31/2021,stocks,Not sure that would work.. when you file taxes the IRS will see two 1099s and put 2 and 2 together
03/31/2021,stocks,He probably got the Palantir hype.
03/31/2021,stocks,Why do you want to sell out of PLTR before demo day 2 and 1st quarter earnings? 1st quarter earnings is expected to be as much as all of last years revenue.
03/31/2021,stocks,Get out dude
03/31/2021,stocks,"The wash rule is an IRS rule related to stating losses from the sale of a stock. A wash sale is when an individual sells or trades a security at a loss and buys the same or a ""substantially identical"" stock within 30 days. 

I.E you cannot take a loss, then re-buy into the stock lower and achieve a gain. in a wash sale, the loss is nullified or disallowed and your cost basis from before is added to the cost basis of your new buy. 

Example: I buy 100 shares at $10. Cost is $1,000, cost basis is $10/share

I sell at $8. loss is -$200

If I buy 100 shares of the same stock again in 30 days, it is a wash sale, my cost basis is the original $10, NOT $8 and I cannot claim $200 in losses on my taxes. You will wash sale up to the original purchase quantity (i.e 100 shares) If I buy more than the first 100, then I can use the new cost ($8) and start averaging down.  If I buy 200 shares @ $8, the first 100 are a wash sale, ($10 cost) the next 100 are at $8 and your new cost basis is $9."
03/31/2021,stocks,It‚Äôs not banned
03/31/2021,stocks,"So the 3k limit is just the max you can take into the next year then?

I thought 3K was the max you can write off... Meaning if I had 50k gains and 10k loss I could write off 3k of the 15k taxes I owed (assuming 30% taxes)"
03/31/2021,stocks,Yikes ok. Something to consider when averaging down.
03/31/2021,stocks,"I think the 3k write-off is only if you have a net loss for the year. If your net loss is 12k, you can deduct 3k of that loss from your income and carry the remaining 9k loss into next year.

In your 50k gain / 10k loss example, the IRS sees that as a 40k net capital gain and is taxed as such"
03/31/2021,stocks,Thank you!
03/31/2021,stocks,Some good info!!
03/31/2021,stocks,Just buy in over time.
03/31/2021,stocks,technically correct but I think you're missing the point. Cathie views it as a long term hold. And she bought at 23. So that kind of flies in the face of what you're saying
03/31/2021,stocks,"And someone else views is as over valued and sold the shares.  

So hard to say either way."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Again, funds are not retail investors, they do not sell simply because they think something is overvalued. Why do you continue to beat this dead horse?

Most institutional sales are leveraged the other way and most need to be closed to remain within operation margins. 

In other words, most hedgefunds are long and short their positions, with the majority being on their conviction. That's why it's called a HEDGE fund. They're both buying and selling shares at the same time Joey.

Get it?

One other pro tip; projecting by calling others ignorant makes you look worse."

03/31/2021,stocks,"No, he's right."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yes, a company listed on the NYSE is actually just funneling money into a proxy of sorts. And they chose a PREMIUM ev maker to do it. Why do I have to explain this shit"

>Like many Chinese companies with listings outside of China, Nio is a variable-interest entity, or VIE, a structure created in the 1990s as a workaround for Chinese companies that are not allowed to have direct foreign ownership.  
>  
>Under the VIE structure, the Chinese company creates two entities, one in China that holds the permits and licenses needed to do business there and the other an offshore entity, in this case in the Cayman Islands, in which foreign investors can buy shares. The Chinese entity, which is usually owned by top executives, pays fees and royalties to the offshore company in contractual arrangements.  
>  
>The biggest example of a VIE is Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., in which the Chinese entity is wholly owned by its founder and chairman, Jack Ma.  
>  
>The risk with this setup is that foreign investors don‚Äôt actually own stock in the company, and local management or even the Chinese government could decide or force a split with the listed company, leaving U.S. investors high and dry."

03/31/2021,stocks,"Tried asking this in options subreddit but that place is pretty dead, so maybe someone here will know. 

So I understand the Greeks and how they influence each other for the most part, but one thing that has eluded me is how vega changes with volatility. I know that vega goes down with time, and that vega represents the dollar change per percentage change in the IV.

My question pertains to AAPL calls. AAPL has incredibly low volatility right now. I believe that AAPL has found its bottom, as it has bounced off of 119 repeatedly while the rest of tech continues to drop. I believe that it will return to the 125-135 range between now and the end of April. 

Trading sideways for a week and a half has caused IV to die down to around 30% on most options. I'm looking to buy some june/July calls while IV is super low and I think the price has bottomed out, then sell into the IV spike when earnings come at the end of April. The last two earnings IV hit about 60% on AAPL. My option I'm eying has a vega of 15, we'll say it drops to 10 by earnings. That would imply that an increase in 30 points in IV would spike the options price by 300$. 

I know that's too good to be true, and that IV going up has some effect on vega, but I don't know how much. How can I figure this out, and also, is my reasoning sound as far as getting the options now while IV is dead and selling into the pre-earnings IV? Is there anywhere to calculate what a 30% increase in IV would actually do? Would greatly appreciate the help!"

03/31/2021,stocks,"I don't **think** a corporate tax hike would in essence trigger a huge sell-off through cascading margin calls. I'm no expert or anything but my intuition is that the bigger threats right now to the market as a whole are the record-high margin debt assumed, overly bullish sentiment on recent returns and hyperactivity in the market (which inherently breeds more risky/ill-advised ventures at the possibility of greater return), and the very high number of new companies hitting the market (largely in hot theme/sectors like EV, space tech, etc.). 

The IPOs/SPACs in combination with the high margin debt I think are the most concerning, especially considering that so many of these new issues are following up on immense performance last year---this lures in curious investors more easily, who venture to guess what the next big thing is before everyone else realizes. Some of the new companies probably also get roped into popular ETFs and whatnot for exactly that reason. Problem is, as so many new, potentially meteoric growth companies enter the market, only so many of them could ever possibly last very long, at least by competition alone. More problematic is that some of these companies will have little or no financial stability at all (with some, I would guess, being straight-up fraudulent). If many of these such companies **do** get roped into portfolios and ETFs and mutual funds (by virtue of """"diversification"""" across a booming, fledgling sector), then capital investment firms and retail investors alike may have significant exposure to them on the whole. And if they **do** end up tanking, **that** is what I fear could be a huge problem in relation to margin debt and margin calls thereto."

I helped her find the reminder and she only got one email which had a title that was designed to look as irrelevant as possible. It looked like a confirmation of the purchase nothing more. No texts. 

I have no doubt its great for business, I imagine a very large percentage of first time users will miss a payment with the system they have in place. Im sure theyve calculated that. 

Most users will blame themselves, because they dont know theyve been slightly nudged into it by design, so Klarna wont get much negative attention. Klarna also follows the law exactly, so no legal repercusions.

Also, it's day #1 of the ETF. It would be idiotic in the extreme to launch with nothing but space-oriented stocks, since all the holdings would immediately shoot up in value just by virtue of being in the ARK universe, and then likely return to saner valuations once the shine wears off.

Thanks for all the votes guys. Another thing to consider: All ARK ETF does not work like your usual MSCI World etc. The big investors gave Cathy and her team the freedom of 5 YEARS! Now, even with that recent dip, she's up over 200% in ca. 2 years.

Due to the high volatility in nearly all of her stocks she will have high volatility in her Funds.. that is normal. Also, she bets on disruption and innovation. So if she picked 20 Small-Caps, maybe 15 will fail, 3 give 200%. 1 300 and the last one is a 10x or more.  
With the massive gains specially in small caps during 2020 the stocks inside of ARk's portfolios got accelerated even beyond their own analyses... so the drawback is more than natural.

Be angry if you trade ARK for short swings, be calm when you are into it for the long play."

ARK could have started this fund at $100 a share or $5 a share--neither number says anything about the valuation of the underlying stocks, and neither price is either cheap or expensive.

I have nothing against speculating about price appreciation, and I hope everyone who buys this fund does well. As I see it, value and price are not the same thing. As the saying goes, price is what you pay, value is what you get. Best of luck to everybody."

When Toyota decides to do something new, it doesn't make its decision haphazardly.

Exactly what I said too. I'm never willing to count Toyota out. Slow and conservative, yes, but meticulous, when they make their new BEVs I have little doubt they'll be very reliable. They've been researching prismatic cells, as well as solid state tech, they obviously do have interest in electric. They're not going to be the first, but they're also not going to put out an OG Leaf that degrades in no time. 

A Tesla partnership would be exciting for both parties with the speculated trade. Help Toyota out on their infotainment and OTA updates, while Tesla is helped with the silly manufacturing mistakes that Toyota is an expert at avoiding that both slow Tesla down and damage their QA reputation."

03/31/2021,stocks,"No you won't.  If it drops 15% you may 'cut your losses' nd then it may shoot right back up in the next day or two or 3.

Then you may say "" ok time to get back in"" and then it drops another 15%.

It's not so easy timing the market... Remember."
03/31/2021,stocks,"well maybe try not holding a stock that drops 15% a day like it's the next amazon? second depending on the stock I have a hard cut off limit. Lastly the conditions to why certain sectors are dropping aren't changing anytime soon. Many of it is just bad valuation being corrected, as it should be eventually. So really if you're holding these stocks, might want to reconsider your valuation instead of looking at what prices it used to be.

You act like ""timing the market"" is so uncommon. You ""time the market"" when you sell a stock after it runs up. Why can't you do the same when it goes down? Even if you're an index fund person, you ""time the market"" when you change stock/bond ratio. You ""time the market"" when you change between different market funds."
03/31/2021,stocks,"I time a little.  It's been proven in the long run to not work as well as holding though.

If you have stocks like MSFT for example, there's not a lot to worry about.  At least for the next 5 years.  Just holding is best.

I've got 19% in msft and AAPL and I'm ok.  I don't worry cause they're the most solid fangs.  Yes they can drop, but they'll come back in fairly certain.

Now GME?  I wouldn't have 20% in that!"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yes and stock picking has been proven to underperform index fund in the long run, so why are you picking stocks? 20% portfolio as well. Bogle would be disappointed. I believe he recommends no more than 10%, preferably 5%? MSFT has been stagnant in the last 20 years, but a few years of bull run and suddenly it's a ""solid FANG"". Likewise, AAPL wasn't a no brainer recommendation before Buffet bought it in 16.

Btw, in case if you didn't know this already. You sell your stock, but you still put in a buy order at the price you sold it for. That way, if it goes back up, you're right back where you left. If it keeps going down, you can now buy your original shares at discount. Kinda obvious but just in case."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Msft has been stagnant??  It's one of the most solid picks out there bud!  It's top weight in every index.

I just went to portfolio visualizer. From 2011 to 2021 msft netted a 26% return.

Before 2009 yes tech wasn't a big thing and it got a 9% return just as VTI did, but we don't live in the same world now.

I was born in 73.   Tech was pay phones.

And no what I said wasn't options, just simple monitoring and re-entry at your original price."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Ok but msft does have Azure now.  Hey if MSFT nets me 10% for the next 10 years, I'm happy.  No one knows.

03/31/2021,stocks,"No. The timeframes and mechanisms are very different. Swing trading can take place over weeks or even months, while day trading is at most a day or two.

While hypothetically someone could make predictions about intraday movement, this is a lot of work and for all intents and purposes what happens in a single day is effectively random to a typical retail trader. It's also unsustainable. A day trader would be trying to scrape let's say maybe .5-2% off a trade, and do so almost every day. This is statistically extremely unlikely to succeed and the risk/reward is very unrewarding. I'm not a day trader myself as I recognize it's pointless to try so I can't elaborate on the exact mechanisms, but the signals a day trader would use aren't the same a swing trader would use. The nature of day trading(closing by end of day) tends to force otherwise temporary losses that a swing trader could simply ignore.

Swing trading ignores the semi random behavior of the day to day and focuses on trading trends. It's much easier to develop risk profiles and entry/exit points."

03/31/2021,stocks,"Why did the Co-CEOs and a 10% + investment firm sell 50% or more the day lock up ended at $35 to $38 per share? I think it's because this is a classic cash out situation. The company is a minnow in the PBM pool controlled by the large Pharmacy Benefit Management companies. GoodRx could be cut out of all their contracts it a short period of time and then the ""savings"" they pass to patients will be gone. GoodRx has one self owned cash flow system and that is GoodRx Gold. Everything else is dependent on splitting fees with large insurance companies (PBMs) called DIR fees. These are largely considered theft by the pharmacy industry and is currently being investigated at the state level in various states like Ohio, Mississippi, and Arkansas. Some of these investigations have lead to supreme court cases. TL;DR GoodRx is a bottom feeder in a broken system run by PBMs. PBMs are under attack legally for DIR fees. IF DIR fees go away, THEN GoodRx goes away. I own Puts.

EDIT: learn more here [https://www.drugchannels.net/2021/03/how-goodrxs-rapid-growth-creates.html](https://www.drugchannels.net/2021/03/how-goodrxs-rapid-growth-creates.html)"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Just from looking at past comments by you are you a  pharmacist? I think GoodRX will correct PBM from over charging by allowing the consumer to shop prices easier

The Good of GoodRx
it is clear to see that comparison-shopping is one way to beat PBMs at their own game and show support for
65

independent pharmacies. And GoodRx provides you the platform to do just that.
Think of it as the equivalent of Expedia and Travelocity but in the pharmaceutical industry. What is even better is that you can get coupons to further bring down the price of prescription drugs that need to be filled.
GoodRx takes advantage of the fact that the cost of drug prices are not regulated and that they vary from one pharmacy to another.  https://cdn.websites.hibu.com/717a8331b7724e73ab0cf036c22a3532/files/uploaded/PBM%20Monopoly%20Book%20%20Final%20Jan%202019.pdf"
03/31/2021,stocks,"Yes I am a pharmacist. What you are missing is that the GoodRx ""coupons"" are only valid if they continue to have contracts with PBMs. The PBMs are the ones negotiating prices with pharmacies, GoodRx simply exposes which network has the lowest price. GoodRx is not involved with paying pharmacies and they are not a PBM (outside of GoodRx gold, which has few participating pharmacies). They have to leech onto PBMs and therefore can never ""beat"" them. Plus Optum and Express Scripts have rolled out ""discount cards"" that are free to use and give non-insured people access to their network pricing (e.g. Express Scripts' Parachute Rx). GoodRx has no moat other than being a household name and a top google result. They also are completely dependent on splitting DIR fees with the PBMs they contract with. DIR fees and the problems surrounding this part of prescription health insurance are what I'm trying to shed a light on."
03/31/2021,stocks,"Appreciate your insight. Will Definitely go down the rabbit hole and research more on this company.

Of course, you must put stop-losses to protect your position - I am doing the same.

What I meant is that the massive bank selling created a snow ball and many many stop losses were hit -> it created a bigger snow ball and amplified the dip.

All media companies are doing the delicate dance of balancing the needs of the current profitable linear TV world with the future of streaming.  ViacomCBS is a profitable company that makes real money off linear, as well as through their distribution.  Their streamer isn't better than Netflix or HBO Max, but they are going to pump up investments over the next few years and will be in a good position as this transition moves even more in the direction of streaming.

Paramount has made a ton of hit shows.  It is just that people don't often associate them with Paramount.  For instance, 13 Reasons Why was a hit on a Netflix, but was a Paramount show.  They make a shitload licensing things like South Park.  They are going to take that money and invest it in content and when the time comes, they will combine the new content they are investing in with existing content that they will stop licensing.  I think it is a healthy, long-term play."
