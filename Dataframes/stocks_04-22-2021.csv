2021-04-22 19:34:19,stocks,"It I will fall until it finds support. Until I see a support level, I don’t want to try and catch the falling knife."
2021-04-22 19:33:36,stocks,"Time to buy, entered a position at 287~"
2021-04-22 19:44:30,stocks,They evidently had a tremendously good fourth quarter of 2020 and a great first quarter of 2021.
2021-04-22 19:42:48,stocks,Coinbase is awful. I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.
2021-04-22 19:35:24,stocks,I don’t get why anyone uses coinbase. If I want to trade crypto I use robinhood because I already have money for trading there. If you want to buy/sell NFTs all the NFT sites that I tried say to use metamask and that coinbase is pointless compared to metamask.
2021-04-22 19:59:40,stocks,">Coinbase is awful.

The exchange and customer service; but as a stock, it has room to grow"
2021-04-22 19:45:04,stocks,Robinhood is absolute trash for crypto
2021-04-22 19:42:32,stocks,"because you own your crypto in coinbase, unlike pp/rh/cashapp etc

coinbase is both an exchange and a bank"
2021-04-22 19:50:15,stocks,"RobinHood is just trash why would anybody even use that brokerage service in the first place. What do they offer is it froze like TD, Schwab, Fidelity, another discount brokers didn’t have. I think anybody who used Robin Hood had never been investing in anything."
2021-04-22 19:23:33,stocks,Sounds like your daily gain vs your total PnL on the position. Your PnL on the whole position is you lost $10/shr day 1 then made $15/shr on day 2... total PnL is $5 but your last day PnL is $15 (not what you pay taxes on fwiw)
2021-04-22 19:14:11,stocks,Sounds like that xoukd cost ya some extra taxes at EOY if you ask me
2021-04-22 19:22:38,stocks,That is not right
2021-04-22 19:27:36,stocks,"Perhaps I'm not familiar with daily gain then. Comparing what I sold a position for to what it closed at the day prior doesn't seem like it should be referred to as a gain, maybe you can say hey theoretically you could have made X would make sense, but it seems very misleading to label it as P/L, when it didn't actually occur."
2021-04-22 19:32:06,stocks,"So PnL can be daily/weekly/monthly whatever. A lot of accounts label it as such... but there is a difference between THEORETICAL and REALIZED PnL. So I didn’t sell/buy any stocks today, but my account still shows a PnL... but it’s not realized so I didn’t lock it in or anything. Just a different way to view ongoing performance.

I don’t use Webull so idk how their platform works but they should be able to provide you total gain/loss on a position and that should match your trade"
2021-04-22 19:34:46,stocks,"On the days (like today) that you didn't trade, what does the P/L represent?"
2021-04-22 19:41:18,stocks,The change in value of your portfolio since the prior close.
2021-04-22 19:46:35,stocks,"See that I understand, comparing your current position to the current price, totally makes sense. I don't understand comparing the prior days closing price to what I sold a position for, it falsely inflates the P/L if the prior day price at close was less that I paid for it. Right?"

2021-04-22 18:58:40,stocks,"Congress doesn’t pass rumors. There will be negotiations that end up meeting somewhere in the middle. If it has to go via reconciliation, that number will be whatever Manchin/Sinema/Kelly arrive at. If it goes bipartisan, it may be lower.

Capital gains taxes have nothing to do with companies, though. Your brokerage will report your gains/losses (if you’re an American) regardless of which country those companies operate or are headquartered in.

As of now, this change will not affect most people here anyway. In fact, it’ll affect almost nobody here."
2021-04-22 19:28:25,stocks,"> Surely these companies operate off shores, so the tax wouldn't affect them.

Do people in the US invest in them? Then they will also be effected. Come on, dude."
2021-04-22 19:49:41,stocks,"Why is everyone saying the sky if falling now?

This was telegraphed MONTHS ago."
2021-04-22 18:56:02,stocks,isnt this a tax on very high earning individuals-  not a corporate tax ?
2021-04-22 19:15:27,stocks,"Is this why the second half of today wiped out all my awesome gains, ending in the red?"
2021-04-22 18:55:23,stocks,"this has nothing to do with companies, only individuals"
2021-04-22 19:04:02,stocks,Tax is on individuals not corporations. But separately there appears to be some traction for a global minimum corporate tax rate. So that’s something you should pay attention to with regards to the intent of your post.
2021-04-22 19:07:40,stocks,"People, who don't make a million plus, getting mad about this tax are stupid."
2021-04-22 18:57:37,stocks,I wouldn't start speculating anything until we see something proposed/passed. I highly doubt we'll ever see such a rate change.
2021-04-22 18:57:21,stocks,[removed]
2021-04-22 19:04:32,stocks,A million in cap gains -- for the highest bracket -- is something that maybe 2% of Americans will ever experience even for a single year of their lives.
2021-04-22 18:58:17,stocks,Yes it is. My mistake
2021-04-22 19:42:05,stocks,Yahoo cover says capital gains which could be considered day traders. Makes sense he target the few who made a couple of bucks in the pandemic bull market.
2021-04-22 18:55:49,stocks,What about private equities?
2021-04-22 19:22:24,stocks,Not really. I think anyone smart should be a little worried when they start taking almost half of anyone’s earnings.
2021-04-22 19:24:00,stocks,"Really?  Maybe they understand that the tax rates all only increase and they will be next.  

Or maybe it's that they are sick of congress always spending more then we can afford abs want then to shut off the tap

Or maybe it's they aren't hypocrites demanding others pay more when they barely pay or don't pay any federal income tax or.collect instead.

I pay about 5% in fed income tax I don't ever support higher taxes in wealthy people. Congress needs a massive diet"
2021-04-22 19:37:34,stocks,"This would most certainly affect people who don’t make a million plus. Who do you think moves the markets? The big money does, and they will certainly have less incentive to invest, thus hurting the average American in the process."
2021-04-22 18:59:31,stocks,Did you make over 1mil in capital gains?
2021-04-22 19:49:58,stocks,"Sure, but the ownership of assets in the public companies are not...really evenly distributed across all Americans. This probably affects at least half of the shares of an average public company owned by individuals that make $1MM plus.

Every 23 year old is on here going like, “big whoop it doesn’t affect me, but why is the stock price dropping?” but they don’t have a handle on who the other owners of their favourite stock are."
2021-04-22 19:57:07,stocks,Day traders aren't really affected that much tbh. The big thing was long term holders maybe selling
2021-04-22 19:43:08,stocks,"Ah yes, trickle down economics, of course. /s"
2021-04-22 19:06:28,stocks,Yes. And I plan on doing it again next year.
2021-04-22 19:01:05,stocks,I dont think that has any relevance to his statement.
2021-04-22 19:57:34,stocks,It’s not 1 million in capital gains. It’s for individuals with income of 1 million
2021-04-22 19:08:05,stocks,Nice and Good luck.
2021-04-22 19:04:44,stocks,"A lot of people are misinformed, you answering for someone doesn't clarify why he thinks biden is a piece of shit. If he is making more than 1mil in capital gains I can see why he's mad, or he may have the wrong idea? Maybe he doesn't like that the taxes will go to childcare or education."
2021-04-22 19:15:42,stocks,Ty.  I've been working with a CPA I want to get to a place where I can start a 501c3 and day trade and then just give away winnings to people to pay bills and shit LMAO ... My CPA was confused why I like day trading so much that I would be willing to do it for other people for free but I mean hey that's just me I suppose
2021-04-22 19:14:26,stocks,"if it pushes the market down, it obviously matters lmao"
2021-04-22 19:29:58,stocks,">  If he is making more than 1mil in capital gains I can see why he's mad

People with real money are the major players moving the market. What do you think happens when that money is hesitant or less likely to invest in the market? Use your brain, the market will tank."
2021-04-22 19:22:27,stocks,I made 5k on NIO today so I've been happy as a clam.
2021-04-22 19:20:32,stocks,"Yea its weird that the news outlet didn't release the article till the spy was riding high and in middle of the trading day, when they had the news and other articles were already out before market open. Almost as if to cause panic or sympathy for billionaires, or they and their friends were set up for a short, I don't know but their timing is weird."
2021-04-22 19:36:52,stocks,"So people are not going to invest? If I have a billion and can invest to make more, I'm going to. I'm not going to not invest and make $0 dollars, i'll invest make profit and pay taxes. I hope the market tanks I can short on the way down and pick up at a cheaper spot, these guys are in the money making business, they are not going anywhere."
2021-04-22 19:21:53,stocks,"ah yes and if the market was down and they released it, itd be because hedge funds want to make more money on puts right?

take off the tin foil hat"
2021-04-22 19:24:23,stocks,They literally waited to release it instead of publish at or before open not tinfoil just wondering why
2021-04-22 17:56:43,stocks,"I think keeping AMZN is a good idea. It’s stagnated in 2018-2019, and then suddenly surged, I think it’s gonna surge again in the next few months. My advice would be to hold it.
I have 3 shares of AMZN, I’m holding it."
2021-04-22 17:58:31,stocks,Keep them as is and go find more funds to add the other companies.
2021-04-22 19:06:54,stocks,"I’d keep and if you don’t feel too much conviction don’t put more into the positions. so most of my money is in VTI/VXUS so I guess that qualifies me for boomer status according to some other comments here but I’m happy with that portfolio foundation. I think there’s some good value in pharma names, one area where the market hasn’t really caught wind and pumped prices. So I’ve been putting some cash to work there."
2021-04-22 17:58:00,stocks,"I wouldn’t sell Amazon for Tesla, Tesla seems like straight snake oil."
2021-04-22 18:01:45,stocks,"I also own AMZN, GOOG, MSFT and AAPL.  I'm assuming you maxed out your contributions to your Roth and that's why you're considering selling AMZN to fund the other purchases?

It's a tough call.  I still believe AMZN has a lot of room for growth in the 5-10 year timespan and I'm firmly holding onto my shares.

If Cathie Woods is to be believed, TSLA has a much larger potential gain based on her share price projection.  I'm hesitant to buy into TSLA right now because there are so many competitors coming into the EV market and new green tech companies are booming which could chip away at TSLA's other revenue streams.

NVDA is a stock that also has potential for growth but I haven't pulled the trigger on.  It just seems too volatile for my tastes.

TL;DR - I would hold AMZN for the time being if I were in your shoes."
2021-04-22 18:54:30,stocks,Honestly I would keep it how you have it and just buy into some ETF's as you get money in/once the market decided its done dipping. At least that seems to be my current plan
2021-04-22 17:57:02,stocks,"I’ve been hearing Amazon to $4,000 for 10 months now, and it’s basically in the same exact spot.  I have 9 shares and desperately want to unload it, but knowing my luck, it will shoot up when I do.  So I’m holding.  The part of me that has a little bit of intelligence says hold.  Most people say hold.  Up to you though."
2021-04-22 18:46:48,stocks,"Damn, this is even more boomer portfolio than the /r/dividends dweebs."

2021-04-22 18:04:57,stocks,Thanks buddy. Solid advice.
2021-04-22 18:06:55,stocks,Agreed. I add more funds weekly. Just added more today. Just as cash. Will probably buy in to stuff with cash later.
2021-04-22 19:12:18,stocks,Thanks for the information. Another point of view unlike others.
2021-04-22 18:06:18,stocks,Appreciate the advice. I'm hesitant too as well.
2021-04-22 18:04:28,stocks,"I'm actually adding more funds weekly. It's cool that we're identical.

I actually have 1 of each of Google. GOOG and GOOGL"
2021-04-22 18:57:00,stocks,"Any advice about ETFs. I wanted Berkshire Hathaway B stock for $270ish but Wells Fargo won't allow it. I Kno about VT, VTI, VXUS but they're so up and then down. Not much real movement. 

Know any good ones?"
2021-04-22 19:23:10,stocks,Hold. I have 7 for at least a 5 year long position. Amazon is JUST getting started with significant earnings growth.
2021-04-22 18:28:05,stocks,Amzn is going to get hit so hard in the coming weeks.  Investors looking for Dividend stocks now.  Amazon? NONE
2021-04-22 18:05:47,stocks,Thank you for the informative reply. Im assuming I'll hold but something about Nvidia lately has full full attention.
2021-04-22 18:48:03,stocks,Awesome input (Not) tell us about your positions.
2021-04-22 18:40:56,stocks,Thank you for your input. I appreciate it.
2021-04-22 18:43:30,stocks,The point of your link was? Oh you're making fun of my small positions or something? This is just one of my portfolios.
2021-04-22 19:22:09,stocks,No problem. Just speaking as if it were me with those positions. I still like Amazon honestly and would add because I could see AWS becoming enormously critical as a % of market cap.
2021-04-22 19:07:10,stocks,"I kinda concur.

I'd short them if it weren't such a slow stock movement to see proceeds."
2021-04-22 19:33:01,stocks,"I'm looking at/watching QQQ, VGT, SPYG mainly. Also possibly some FAN/TAN, even SPGI"
2021-04-22 18:45:26,stocks,Tell me more about what you mean. I Know amazon doesn't pay dividends but neither does Google.
2021-04-22 18:50:44,stocks,All in $NIO shares at the moment.
2021-04-22 18:54:32,stocks,MSFT to the moon!
2021-04-22 18:51:37,stocks,That's solid. At least I hope so. Not too expensive and they're looking to expand in Europe. I dig it. Hope it works out well for you l.
2021-04-22 18:55:32,stocks,I think it's doing good. Heard they might aquire discord. Just acquired Bethesda. Hoping for $300+ EOY
2021-04-22 18:58:14,stocks,"Msft actually just ended talks with Discord not too long ago, but still a good long term hold regardless"
2021-04-22 18:57:52,stocks,"Discord decided to go public on their own.

Microsoft is going to double their dividend instead.
 
BOOM"
2021-04-22 18:59:50,stocks,I read that they ended their talks. Didn't know if that meant an acquisition was taking place or not.
2021-04-22 18:58:30,stocks,Oh thank you for the News on that. I didn't read too deep into it.
2021-04-22 18:31:46,stocks,"I like this one alot, even without dooya they have around a 50-60% market share in an exploding industry in the most populous country in the world. They had an EPS gain of 90% YoY with a 30% increase in revenue. I truly believe the growth has just begun here.

I'm long Huya, I got in before it went parabolic a few months back."
2021-04-22 17:42:22,stocks,"My biggest issue is its PEG of nearly 5, suggesting its very overvalued, though its forward P/E is pretty good. Might be worth investing in but I wouldn't expect to see any massive returns. Then ofc the fact that its Chinese will likely keep it down a bit. Overall a pretty good stock, but I personally wouldn't invest"
2021-04-22 19:36:45,stocks,This has been a roller coaster for me... in since last May and considered selling in the 30’s but still see upside so I’m definitely not selling here!!  China is nuts for gaming!

2021-04-22 17:21:45,stocks,"Increasing capital gains tax rate is a must and everyone complaining about it is short sighted. The government needs to generate more income, and the best way to do that is take money from people who already have a lot. Next to nobody on Reddit is ever (let alone regularly) going to clear $1M+ in capital gains, and as such will never be negatively affected by these hikes. Markets will have short-term reactions to anything tax related, but those changes are very quickly normalized and digested by the market.

Have long positions and these tax increases will only be a good thing."

2021-04-22 18:31:30,stocks,It may be big hedge funds or people with big money getting a ton of gain now and maybe people who can't read and think it effects them.

I’d like to see a transaction tax (like 0.1% per trade) so that these high frequency traders pay a price for adding tons of volatility to the market. Investors like me (and probably you, reading this) who make a few trades a week would pay maybe $100 a year in additional taxes but HFTs would pay millions... and at the same time it would help level out some of these wild swings we see from programmed trading."

2021-04-22 18:29:44,stocks,The Cayman Islands. Panama. Bermuda. Why bother investing as an American when residents of places like New York and California would at that point be paying over 50% of their gains in taxes? Just buy Muni Bonds at that point.

2021-04-22 19:21:33,stocks,"I apologize. On re-reading numerous articles, it seems most are guessing it'll only apply to those earning $1 million as you said. Only a minority feel it'll apply to all capital gains which is when those earning $40k would also suffer. You're likely (hopefully) right that it'll only directly punish those earning a million yearly. Although that may indirectly lower the stock market gains for the non wealthy if the rich invest in non-stocks because of this."

How will the IRS ever catch you? You ask. 

This is how: the US government goes after banks in tax havens and threatens to sanction them unless they help enforce tax collection against Americans. 

As a result, in the last few years it has become basically impossible for Americans to open a remote bank account in Hong Kong, as an example. 

Not sure about other tax havens. HK is what I have personal experience with.

The US has one of the lowest capital gains rates in the world. In Canada it is 50%. Canada has an advanced economy with plenty of wealth. Don't be so dramatic."

2021-04-22 16:15:46,stocks,"Well this is more financial advice than it is stock market advice, so I’ll be vague.  “Experts” recommend that your 401k contribution total approximately 15% (combination of yours and your employers contribution).  You said this is a pension, so I’m not really sure if there is a different recommendation.  If it’s the same, then you’re fine there.  What to do with your $40k cash and impending home purchase is another story.  You’ll want to have 10-20% to put down.  Since rates are so low and we are seeing historic returns in the market, it might be worth considering putting down as little as possible.  You’ll want to see how much they charge you for PMI if you are putting less than 20% down, but it could be really cheap.  For instance, I was going to put down 20%, but ended up putting 10% down, because PMI was only $33/month for 36-48 months.  But without knowing the price range of the houses you’re looking at, 10-20% could end up being most of that $40k.  In the meantime, though, you can invest that money in the market or put it in a “high yield” savings account.  The risk/reward for each is drastically different, though.  Keep in mind, if you invest, it’s possible your $40k is now worth $30-$35k when you’re ready to close on that house.  On the flip side, it could be worth $45-$50k too.  It’s not a decision that should be taken lightly.  Good luck."
2021-04-22 16:42:10,stocks,Roth IRA.. have you contributed?  You can do $6k for 2021 (and maybe still 2020).    You can take up to $10k of your contributions without penalty for purchase of first home.    Any profit has to stay until you 59 or pay penalties..but at least you can invest and build tax free gains in the meantime. Just validate and research on this

I totally block this out now and just hope some people panic sell so I can buy lower.

I really wonder if there is even a single case out of the 1000's of stock lawsuits every year where shareholders were awarded anything or if all these lawsuits end up in absolutely nothing.

P.S. Maybe NKLA where the short seller report was actually true which is rare enough too."

That being said, if you're on the fence, don't invest more than you're willing to lose.  Any company can ENRON."
2021-04-22 17:37:14,stocks,Class actions are riskier than a standard lawsuit as more likely to be legitimate claim rather than settlement shakedown. If a class is established its usually shown repeat offenses/pattern of behaviour against a class of customer etc. Usually law firms take these on a % of settlement/ damages if they see merit as individuals rarely have funds to pay legal fees. A firm willing to work out of pocket must see some merit in the claim. Just my thoughts on it.
2021-04-22 16:20:08,stocks,"As others said, it depends on the suit. Facebook being sued for privacy is minor compared to say Apple being sued for falsely reporting the amount of phones they sold. BLU lawsuit is big enough that I probably would get out and wait for it to be sorted out, though I really haven't done much research so I can't say how damaging this could be.

2021-04-22 14:40:15,stocks,"Dividends are automatically subject to a white holding tax, meaning their taxed in the US by 15% before you ever receive them. Capital gains are paid in your own country, not the US"
2021-04-22 15:01:58,stocks,If you don't plan on coming to the US I wouldn't even pay it!
2021-04-22 18:16:20,stocks,"If you have less than £20k/yr to invest, don't plan on using margin or using derivatives, consider using an ISA.

Aside from dividend withholding tax (15% on US->UK, nothing on UK stocks), you are subject to UK taxes. 0% on gains/losses from an ISA.

Ironically this means UK residents have a better time investing in US stocks than US citizens themselves."
2021-04-22 16:34:52,stocks,"Any dividends paid out by US companies will get hit by 30% withholding tax which is deducted before the dividends reach your account. As for capital gains tax you don't pay anything until you make over £12300 profit in a tax year. Anything you make over this amount will be hit with 10% tax, but this is not automatically deducted. You have to declare it on a self assessment tax return to HMRC. If you have a stocks and shares ISA then you don't pay any tax  whatsoever, regardless of how much you make. I'm a fellow UK investor."
2021-04-22 19:47:17,stocks,"You could bypass all of this CGT by opening a stocks and shares ISA, buy US stocks within this ISA and not pay a penny in CGT."
2021-04-22 15:26:32,stocks,"As r/manitowoc2260 says.  


Dividends for US stocks are withheld by the company before it reaches you. But as youself said countries have agreements (well many do). If the US and UK have an agreement (I would guess they do), then you can subtact the 15% on taxes you normaly pay on dividens in the UK.  


Like Denmark and US also have an agreement. When I get dividends on my US stocks the 15%  is withheld by the company. But I can subtract that from my taxes. Had it been a danish company I would pay 27% on dividens.   


Now from the dividens from the US I pay 12% in DK, so it still totals to 27% (15% to the US-government and 12% to the danish government). My broker automatic reports it to the Danish IRS (if they mess it up, I can change it on my yearly tax form).   


Capital gains from selling the stock will be taxed in Denmark, well UK in your case :-)   


The agreements are made to make sure, that ppl are not dobbeled taxed.  


But it really depends on what countries you invest in, and what products you use. IIRC then many eft's in ireland do not have white holding tax (well atleast for danes).

So try call your broker and ask how they handle it."
2021-04-22 14:43:02,stocks,What trading software are you using? If you are on T212 you don’t actually own the shares so you may avoid the tax on it...
2021-04-22 14:37:13,stocks,First I've heard of this... I'm UK as well...
2021-04-22 17:30:35,stocks,"As most people have said, the 15% US witholding tax will be taken off dividends automatically. As for CPT there are agreements between the UK and US so you only have to pay it for the country you're in (UK, so foreign investors don't get double taxed).

However if this is in an ISA (if it's not then you should switch to one) then you pay 0 tax on all profits from selling, no tax on divdends for LSE stocks, and only witholding tax for foreign stocks which is automatically deducted before you receive them anyway.

Only reason to not use an ISA is if you have more than 20k/year to invest, or you want to invest in stocks which aren't eligible (like TSM but there are some ISA eligible ETFs which have high weightings in them)."
2021-04-22 18:06:48,stocks,"You basically don't need to worry about anything, until you've reached the capital gains allowance."
2021-04-22 14:48:52,stocks,So if I sold my shares I would only pay the capital gains in the UK as technically I haven't 'earned' any money directly from the companies themselves (ie the dividend payment) as they arent actually paying me because it's the shares I'm selling which is nothing to actually do with the company and it's not like I'm employed by the company and receiving a 'wage'as such.

2021-04-22 16:56:16,stocks,"Yeah I had read on the HMRC's website about the capital gains tax rules etc. And that you have to fill in a tax form declaring your gains as it's not automatically deducted etc. (Oh to live in a tax haven 😂😂😂, but to be fair, if I ever have to pay capital gains tax, I'll have made a nice wedge of cash to have put me in that position in the first place, so even with HMRC bending us over a desk to extract our taxes, at least we are still in the money (got to dream big lol!))"

With Opendoor you can close quickly without any of what I just listed, which could very well add up to be over a few percent of the house.

Just wanted to know if anyone else thinks it's ""normal"" to get caught in all the noise."
2021-04-22 11:45:31,stocks,"2020 was a very unusual year in the stock market. An abrupt drop, followed by stimulus checks, and a near instant recovery means that many people who started investing last year saw nothing but huge gains and have no experience beyond that.

The last couple weeks are closer to how the market behaves in ""normal"" years, so you should be prepared for more of this in the future

Although truthfully, even the whole last decade has been ""unusual"" in the context of the whole history of the stock market, low inflation despite incredibly low historic interest rates meant stocks had tremendous gains, it will be interesting to look back at this time period 20 years from now and see how it fits into the big picture."

2021-04-22 16:57:31,stocks,It’s going to get worse except for a select few...
2021-04-22 11:57:43,stocks,"Big caveat: the market is incredibly overvalued as a whole based on a several big indicators. That means stocks are overvalued, including ones you may hold.

You may not be seeing a loss of value, you may be seeing a loss in inflated prices. Depending on the stock you hold, you may be losing 15% on something that is 45% overpriced, for example.

Warren Buffett has been a notable investor for decades. He has managed to get a 20% return on his fund. OVERALL.

Big gains. Big losses. 20% overall.

He is a huge exception to the rule when it comes to expectations about returns. That's why his name is known. He's proven he's good.

A lot of people consider a 5-7% return from the start market every year a good return.

Because of last year with Covid, tons of retail traders joining the market and flooding the internet and news, a lot of people consider anything less than 20% a horrible return.

If you made 30% 80% 150% from last year, you need to know that was a statistical anomaly. 

Last year was a very specific (and rare) trading year for a variety of reasons. 

If you're batting better that Warren Buffett who has been doing this for half a century and you just joined the market, you are either lucky with timing or a savant. 

It's important to be realistic about your abilities. There are a lot of savants out there, staring youtube channels, on twitch and twitter. 

Because a lot of people think making money indicates ability at trading. It doesn't necessarily correlate.

It's like poker. Someone sits down. Makes a horrible call. Takes down a huge pot. Those chips aren't proof they are a good player. Those chips prove they are bad. But they consider themselves as expert and keep on playing. Over time, they lose their money. 

I generated a 60% return in the last year. I should not have been able to do that. I am not knowlegeable or skillful enough to do that. But I did. 

I have taken my money off the market until I see another opportunity that is so obvious that it allows for new traders like me to have an edge.

If I don't see anything like that, my money will sit on the sidelines."

There’s a lot of benefits. But don’t let that make you think that makes you a ton of cash, still gotta put the work in.

So I agree."
2021-04-22 18:06:49,stocks,Buffet himself said that berkshire is not likely to beat the S&P during a bull market. It isn't really easy with 100s of billions of cash with no where to put it

2021-04-22 18:38:04,stocks,"Why Nasdaq specifically? When people in the US originally talked about buying the broad market, they meant buying the entire US publicly traded market (by market cap).

That's VTI (or VTSAX for mutual fund). And this might surprise you but stocks are risky by nature. The entire market can drop 50, 60, 70, 80%. We had financial crisis, great depressions, etc.

Do you need this money right away or 20+ years later? And 1%? Like that's nothing. That's just another day.

2021-04-22 16:38:31,stocks,"Market is frothy as heck and there’s an incoming correction that’ll make the Great Depression look like a walk in the park. This subreddit isn’t real big acknowledging the warning signs and sirens that are blaring right now though. 

Banks are about to shut down. They just posted record profits, and for some reason immediately need to raise record amounts of cash right after - 7/7 of the big ones have raised capital - Wells Fargo through selling off investment assets, and the rest through selling bonds. Buffett just bailed on all his bank positions, and the regulatory bodies are starting to come after banks for inflating the value of their assets. Which, given that context, makes the fact that banks are closing branches all over the country without any heads up and with conflicting explanations, and simultaneously lowering credit limits suggests something is up. I’m sure all the insider trading (which, I’ll acknowledge, does typically spike this time of year) has nothing to do with people seeing the writing on the wall. 

Meanwhile margin debt is as high as its ever been, and generally when it reaches peaks like this, there is an immediate market crash right after. 

You’re not alone in noticing your stocks are getting hammered, but this is just a taste of what’s to come. Being down 5% sucks, right up until you compare it to being down 60%. 

In short, if you’re invested in stocks with low liquidity and there is a rush for the exit, you’re going to have a bad time, and be careful how you invest."

2021-04-22 18:59:58,stocks,">It's not JUST 1%. It's an index.

And I'm saying equity indices can drop by over half in very unfortunate times.

Look at Japan's Nikkei 225. It still hasn't come back to the 1989 highs.

The more 'overpriced' stocks become, the more risk investors have to take. There's a reason why the bond market is larger than the stock market.

While the risk seems very low long term, there is still a 'risk'. Hence why people recommend to consistently invest through both the highs and lows (cause it's so hard to time).

Post 2009 has given a lot of investors a very romantic view of the stock market (and especially post 2020 March). Truth is, stocks don't always go up. It is natural (and healthy) for stocks to move up and down daily.

The US market historically returned over long periods of time about 10% before inflation. There's 252 trading days a year. That means in average each day returned about 0.039% . We have been having huge gains almost daily for quite some time now. It's not abnormal for stocks to go down a bit from time to time after such huge gains."

The market does seem high based on historical indicators, but doesn’t it seem like there are countervailing macro issues that will delay any massive correction for a bit?

As a disclaimer, I’m new to the subreddit and am not a stock/econ expert, so please educate me if I’m missing something.

EDIT: Should have mentioned that I believe we’re potentially nearing the end of a long term debt cycle, which supports a market correction occurring. I just don’t think it happens in the next two years (and timing seems somewhat important if you rebalance your portfolio on an annual/biannual basis)."

2021-04-22 17:54:28,stocks,"I think we’re talking days, maybe weeks. Banks have actively been hosting all nighters every day for the past week. And today, a new rule went into place requiring funds keep greater amounts of collateral on hand so that there is less of a chance of an archegos like blowup. I expect there are some fund managers absolutely sweating bullets right this exact minute - having failed to correctly balance their account today, received a margin call this afternoon giving them 24 hours to fix their issues or go into default and be liquidated. 

We’ll see if it turns into a more widespread problem - I believe that the bubble has already popped and the rest of the finance world just hasn’t caught up yet and realized, but time will tell if I’m a conspiracy nut.

2021-04-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Unpopular Opinion: Picking Stocks is Better Right Now We have all heard the time tested advice of time in the market beats timing the market and that picking stocks is almost never the better strategy than just investing in indexes and DCAing over the years. Well, I’m going to venture to argue that now is one of the rare times when the market is so overvalued as a whole that picking individual stocks actually will allow you to outperform for the next 10 years or so. 

Of course this is predicated on the assumption that the stock picker is able to value businesses is many different ways and has a strong core competence in whatever industry and individual company he or she selects. 

The crash that happened last year due to the pandemic has created massive pits of opportunities in this market. If you are able to see between the lines and start searching for individual companies that you have a competitive advantage in knowledge base in, then you may just find a stock that will help you easily outperform the index for the foreseeable long term(10-20 years)

It is also worth noting that we do not know how long this overvalued market will go on. Warren Buffett is famous for saying “the market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent”. It’s perfectly possible that this market chugs upwards 20% a year for the next ten years without skipping a beat. However, it will eventually correct and if you are in stocks that are undervalued and have a high margin of safety and a competitive advantage/strong market share, you will outperform over time. 

It is not unattainable to do this and I am going to rest my case with one final statement:

I believe it is markets like these that are obviously overvalued, but not so overextended that we are in pure euphoria that we can find the best opportunities. They will be hiding from you, undiscovered from the general public or generally tossed aside as not a part of the “new paradigm”. These are the small gold nuggets that will be the 10baggers in your portfolio. They will be like finding needles in a haystack, but if you do end up finding one, you will prosper greatly.

Edit:  Top 5 stocks make up 18% of market weighting currently

Edit:  y’all need to take a chill pill and quit acting like this was a research paper. It’s an opinionated post. If I’m wrong then I’m wrong. You’re not unique for pointing a flaw in the post out."

2021-04-22 12:04:41,stocks,"I agree, and think you put it pretty well. I have a similar thought process, but you're right this is an unpopular opinion on this sub. I think the sentiment on this sub is mostly that just investing in SPY and ETFs and never looking again is the best strategy. Many people on this sub, even after doing no research, just call 90% of sectors that aren't big tech or value plays overvalued and garbage. At least that's what I've been seeing in the last few months.

Everyone's stuck in december/january when lots of things had run up, and were overbought/due for a correction. But not that many people have been talking about the correction happening to all SPACS, genomics, EV, growth and many other sectors. Once a day I see the same post: ""Market is trading at record highs, crash imminent??"", ""Should I be worried, everything is overvalued?"" These types of posts.

Well I usually don't go by this saying but right now people are fearful, and I think most of it is irrational, so I am being greedy and buying up this fire sale. And as soon as the hype starts picking back up and people are mentioning the SPACS and growth stocks everyday, that will be when everyone is greedy and I should sell. Just my 2 cents."
2021-04-22 12:44:19,stocks,I agree. That's the reason why I am in stocks like Shell and AMD - I simply can't see those stocks still at those levels despite recovery (oil) and market leading products (AMD).
2021-04-22 11:47:03,stocks,"Some of them are hiding even in plain sight right at the top of NASDAQ or S&P 500. There were some serious gains in old behemoths like IBM, even.

But then again, any one pick can go south pretty quickly based on no visible indicators until you see it plummeted - on the charts, after the fact.

It happens to the best. NFLX, TSLA, cough cough. 

It also just happened to classics like Tobacco stocks on a very obscure news bit, resulting in a fire sale drop of 8-10%.

These catalysts can be anything from silly things like big ""take-win"" orders kicking on a huge run-up, plummeting market prices to something you couldn't see, also see above note on Tobacco taking a huge hit.

If you put a single chip on a number, you take a gamble for a 35-bagger or losing your lot quickly.

Best case is you're right in your pick. Or pure lucky. Or a little of both ideally."

HYLN, C3AI, PLTR, APPH, CRSP, BEAM, MAXN, FUBO(likely my most risk heavy). Also, I'm looking at multiple companies in all of these different sectors, but these are the ones I have personally come to that I have conviction in and believe in them for the next decade+. 

I think there will be multiple genomics stocks that do well, I think multiple solar stocks will also do well. EV is more speculative right now from what I gather.

In a market like this where the stark contrast of overvalued and undervalued is more apparent, the individual ability of being able to value a business will serve you far better than accepting a 41 P/E of the S&P"

2021-04-22 00:00:00,stocks,"How to determine (re)buying point Hi all. Bit of a noob question here but:

&#x200B;

I have been investing since the beginning of the year.

So far sitting on 10% ROI and feeling good about my portfolio and am looking really to add more shares of stocks that I have. So my question is - how do you generally find entry points to reinvest in stocks that you like?

&#x200B;

From what I gather you could:

&#x200B;

* Buy in as soon as you get money, dont worry about price point, as over time the stocks will moon so high it won matter
* Wait for absolute bloody days when stocks are at week - month lows (I know for example we had a particularly bloody set of weeks like a month ago)
* Somewhere in the middle - where I set a price point im comfortable with and just wait until it drops there.

&#x200B;

I am trying to do number 3, I am waiting for some decent price points (probably not lows but definetly not at the absolute high) so that I keep a decent DCA but also to practice for my riskier stocks on how to find good entry (and inevitably exit points). 

&#x200B;

Any technical indicators I should look for? Qualitative tips? Happy to learn.

&#x200B;

For reference: the stocks I am specifically looking at: MSFT, SPY, VTI

I sold it last year because I already owned shares of MSFT and AAPL, but if I remember correctly, those two make up 40-50% of the fund, and the rest is spread around a little more. 

Do your own research and look at the company weights in the fund. Single stocks can provide more upside, but ETFs usually aren’t going to crater if you want to protect your downside a bit."
2021-04-22 16:38:17,stocks,"22 year old investor here, i’ve made a lot of fuckin mistakes so here is what i’d say so you can avoid some suffering:

1. Pick companies you actually know, so you’re not just speculating price as your only logic to selecting the stock. Seriously, i’m dumb as hell and didn’t do this at first. You’ll lose money 9 times out of 10.

2. Don’t be hesitant investing in ETFs. It’s hard to beat the market. I think today is the only day in the last 3 months where my stocks have outperformed VOO (the only ETF in my portfolio).

3. Microsoft and Apple are good choices. Barring a market collapse, they’re almost ensured to increase in value. I wish i had those in my portfolio.

4. Pick sectors you believe in and know shit about. For example: I know a lot about the EV market through my job, so I own a lot of EV stocks and they’ve done wayyyy better than the rest of my portfolio. If you want EV stocks, go with Nio, Ford, GM, Tesla, or Stellantis. I own 3 of those, i won’t say which tho so you aren’t biased in case u wanna pick some EV stocks.

Netflix has figured out that big splashy shows (looking at Star Wars and Marvel here) don’t justify their budgets compared to their viewing rates.

For example The Falcon and The Winter Soldier had 628 million viewing minutes according to Nielsen last week, and it cost ~150 million to make

Who Killed Sara and Ginny and Georgia combined had 753 million viewing minutes last week, and the combined budget for both those shows is probably in the 1-3 million range.

In fact last week 9 of the top 10 most streamed shows were on Netflix, and Falcon and the Winter Soldier was beat out by NCIS and Criminal Minds.

 - High debt. Poor record on content production.

2021-04-22 16:54:18,stocks,It’s overvalued right now
2021-04-22 19:43:49,stocks,"At this point, I think the downside to Netflix is greater than their upside and therefore I would not invest in them. The competition that Netflix faces will continue to get stronger which will require Netflix to spend more money to defend their market-share against the competition. And given that Netflix is not diversified in any way other than the money that they make from subscriptions; the risk of Netflix losing subscribers to other services is just too great.

I like to invest in Roku as my play on streaming instead since they are selling the picks and shovels to this streaming gold rush. Roku doesn't care who wins the streaming war since they will be taking a cut of the money from all of the streaming services so the more new streaming services that get created and the more subscribers that they get, the more money Roku makes just for simply letting them be a part of their platform. If Netflix continues to dominate, Roku benefits since they will take their cut of the money from Netflix. If Netflix loses market-share to other streaming services, Roku still benefits and will just take their cut of the money from the other streaming gold miners."

And at the end of the day, Netflix is wayy outspending disney + too"
2021-04-22 19:57:05,stocks,"Don't confuse ""most content"" with ""best content"". Netflix seems to care much more and quantity and always having something new than they do about quality and creating a great long-term rewarding show. I personally don't like this approach to television.

I think that the vast majority of Netflix shows are mediocre at best and even when they get a rare good one, they often just randomly cancel it before it ever has a chance to grow into something truly rewarding. Other streaming services may not deliver as much content as Netflix, but I have much more confidence in some of the other players like HBO to deliver high quality, long-term rewarding shows as they have a long track record of doing."
2021-04-22 10:40:12,stocks,"This is a bit antiquated. Not recommending Netflix, but some companies will still have value at P/E’s in the 100’s. If investors see potential growth as large. Even apart from those outliers, 25 in the current climate can't be found in any blue chip stocks. Although I agree with the statement above in my heart it is of no use right now and the forseable future. The P/E is a very useful measure stickbot and you should familiarize your self with it very soon. As for Netflix just remember what your doing as an investor should be comparing Netflix to similar companies using ratios (like P/E) to make the most informed decision with your money. If you believe the sector is growing then you should chose, amoung other things, what gives the most value for your money."

A very high P/E indicates the price of the stock is high relative to what it earns

A low one, indicates price is low. 

There is no exact science with P/Es, but there is usually a point where unless the company is aggressively growing, the price growth exceeds the revenue growth, and the P/E shoots up. this can indicate an overpriced stock. 

With netflix, we know it is NOT growing any longer. shrinking in fact, losing subscribers. This is a situation where an inflated 61 P/E is not looking great..."

They set those prices for a reason. They'll be more than happy to beat netfix in terms of subscribers alone, which i think they've got a good chance of doing and is more relevant to the ecosystem they've got going on anyway.

Walt Disney said on Wednesday it had reached a deal with Sony Pictures to bring new ""Spider-Man"" movies and other films to Disney's streaming services and TV networks in the United States after they play on Netflix.

Disney also secured rights to offer older Sony films, including ""Jumanji"" and ""Hotel Transylvania,"" much sooner.

The company said it will add a significant number of Sony titles to Hulu starting in June.

This is a very positive news for Disney. It is spending more on contents to take on Netflix. As the economy reopening, Disney will be a better bet compared to Netflix due to it theme parks and studio businesses. The stock is trading near 1 month low, it is a good opportunity to buy some shares around $180.

Thanks for the awards."

2. SM: NWH hits Netflix after a three month theatrical window in March 2022
3. 18 months later in September 2023, No Way Home lands on Disney+.

I think Netflix still won this. They’re getting the exclusive rights in the US *immediately* after theatrical exhibition. That’s the best time to get these titles. So congrats to Disney for figuring out how to get Spider-Man on Disney+ but the truth is that the demand for these movies diminishes over time and they got Netflix’s sloppy seconds.

2021-04-22 12:31:12,stocks,Idk Netflix just doesn’t have that good of content anymore. IMO there originals just aren’t that interesting and are super political. I use my parents netflix but if I had to pay for it I’d cancel my subscription I just never use it. Tv has just gone downhill and after covid I can’t think of anything I need to catch up on lol.

Then they had some good dramas of their own and great Docuseries like Making a Murderer while they got rid of tons of studio hits and went to garbage movies and shows that cost next to nothing to license. 

Now they only push original content which is almost all terrible with the occasional rockstar like Tiger King. Paying every month for the occasional Tiger King isn't a great deal but Hulu and HBO have been absolute shit lately as well. HULU being the worst of the 3, it's like they don't even try."

2021-04-22 19:36:38,stocks,"I agree with you on a lot of this. Myself, and friends and family, have begun avoiding the Netflix originals because they keep abandoning them after a season or two. Hell we waited what, 2 years for another season of Black Mirror and got 3 episodes? Mindhunter has been languishing forever. 

When they starting shifting from licensed content to original content, it wasnt that big of a deal, because they had some interesting options - but it seems like they went with the shotgun approach, just greenlit every idea for 1 or 2 seasons and spread themselves too thin, then failed to followup on the successes. 

Agreed on the occasional hit. I do really enjoy some of their docu-series, like the recent one about the art heist at the museum and such, but yea.. I am a member on a family account, I dont think I would bother paying for my own if I didnt have that option. 

I spend more time on Hulu these days but thats mostly because it has a lot of shows that I tend to use as ""background noise"". When Im actually sitting down to watch something, its usually HBO or Amazon Prime."

- Can’t wait for it to pop I have so much money on the sidelines
- There is going to be huge inflation

Has anyone else been hearing arguments along these lines? And to what degree are you hearing them (trying to overcome the effect of recommendation algorithms)? Also how do these arguments compare to the arguments people were making during the dotcom bubble?

My concern is that if this is a bubble then there shouldn’t be too many people on the sidelines waiting for a dip. But there are since savings have been increasing quickly over the past year. Also, were there inflation worries during the dotcom bubble?"

The amount on the sidelines should be determined by the Monthly and Weekly charts of the QQQ and SPY. Perfect example is QQQ. January printed a Doji ( Neutral ) so I’m full bore. Halfway through February it’s making a Shooting Star so sell winners raise cash and wait. Then in March you see it touch the top of November candle and bottom of December candle you get back in. Then as we trend in April to a new ATH on a green candle you keep SOME money on the sidelines by selling some winners and wait to see how the month finishes out because the volumn this month is straight pathetic which means the recent run up is most likely retail traders only. I know this is a little long winded but I hope it helps.

I have not been able to find an answer via Google (maybe because I don't know the right terms to search):

A stock is listed at NASDAQ. NASDAQ is closed. The same stock can be traded at exchanges across the world. During NASDAQ's closing hours, the stock is traded at exchanges in APAC and EMEA and stock price rises above NASDAQ's closing price. NASDAQ opens. How is the new price at NASDAQ set and how does it affect the global stock price if NASDAQ is a) the stock's original listing place and b) the market with the most trades?"

2021-04-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Why I bet on the short squeeze of Discovery Communications and Root We all search for the right YOLO. While I don't dream to much about finding one, I really think that the next short squeeze can bring me good profits. And that is what I am really searching for. Today I choose to invest in two companies that are ripe for squeezing.  

Discovery Communications $DISCA saw an extreme drop at the end of March this year, after more than doubling in the first three months. The problem was with the brokers of Archegos Capital Management liquidating their positions in it.

But, after this correction shares at today’s prices (around $37 per share) are reasonably priced, at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 13x. With earnings per share (EPS) set to rise by around 14.6% between 2021 and 2022, this company remains in growth mode, as the subscriber base of streaming offerings such as Discovery+ remains on the rise.

At the current situation, I believe that by buying DISCA stock you’re getting a growing business, at an attractive valuation, coupled with the potential for a massive rip, if those betting against it start unwinding their positions.

Root $Root is one of the most innovative insurance companies out there that debuted last year. Over the past six months its price tumbled from $27 to around $10 because of the short sellers that believe it to be overvalued or don't understand its industry. The business model and the technology this company uses to price insurance makes it an ideal candidate to disrupt the insurance industry. Similar to what Lemonade did at its time. Some analysts suggest that the price of $ROOT will touch $9, but I am willing to take the risk at $10. I will put it in my portfolio and forget about it for the next couple of years. With 39% of its shares sold short, it won't take much to turbocharge it. With so many betting against it, the odds of it popping on a squeeze likely exceed its chances of falling far into the single-digits. 

Good luck everyone!"
2021-04-22 08:58:13,stocks,"I think one of the items weighing on Root, and to a certain extent Metromile too, is the news on Lemonade entering the auto insurance space. For whatever reason, investors seem to think that only Lemonade can make an impact in this space. It will be interesting to see how that business decision plays out.Lemonade is also the crowded insurtech trade for the time being."
2021-04-22 09:11:03,stocks,"Root has reasons for being so heavily shorted. Their revenue shrank last year during covid, they have significant cash burn and no where near profitable, and I have seen a ton of bad reviews. People take it personally when Root charges them higher cost for insurance because it’s an impersonal AI that judges you based on how you drive, not your history of accidents which may be clean. Root is still a big risk despite being so low."

2021-04-22 16:04:36,stocks,"The biggest problem with CS is not this recent dip/loss - but the atrocious management/culture at the bank.

For years CS has been lagging its European peers with the exception of Deutschebank (and has been miles behind its US peers) - and the solution of management is just to “take more risk”. It’s not like they even took smart risk either - these huge losses weren’t through doing anything exotic/exciting, in both the case of Greensill and Archegos they were basically just a lender.

Personally I just don’t see the appeal, unless management is completely gutted (starting with the CEO who threw Lara Warner under the bus, not that she was competent either).

I don’t think you’ll necessarily lose lots on CS - in reality I think it will either be a value trap that goes nowhere for years, or just bleeds out slowly over time. There just isn’t much attraction to it - on paper it might look cheap, but in terms of future strategy the same management have been trying stuff that just hasn’t been working for years and years. Why would the next 5 years be any different?"

As much as I'd like to continue to work from home forever most companies have already decided it's back to the office in some form after covid. 

Even GOOGLE said they are only allowing employees 14 WFH days a year. A YEAR

2021-04-22 12:35:09,stocks,"> aren't leaving cities just downsizing and catching covid lease deals big time

Do you see this part you wrote? Plenty of companies will look for expense reduction in the real estate portfolio and this is gonna cause them to lower their demand for office space in prime downtown areas. I agree they're not leaving, but the next lease is gonna go from 10 floors to 7. Companies are still paying their leases, but as options, extensions and renewals come up, there will be way more space available at lower prices. The positions these financial institutions have are leveraged, so even a small drop in asset value has a magnified impact on their balance sheets. I don't think it's going to be ""blood on the streets"" bad in CRE, but even a 5% drop is really painful when you have a leveraged position."

2021-04-22 07:46:15,stocks,S&P 500 is the greatest index you can invest in for long term profits

Just my opinion, but if you aren’t actively managing it and want to buy it and forget, indexes do better over time.  I think fidelity also offers a S&P 500 stock index."
2021-04-22 07:50:18,stocks,"Hello u/elligre,
Congratulations for setting your daughters up for success! You have the right mindset and you will find success.
I know I’m a stranger on the internet and I can claim to be anyone. I’m sure you will get plenty of good advice here and you will also listen to other professionals give their opinions on the media or read articles that suggest you do this or that.... which eventually makes you feel overwhelmed and confused because you’re flooded with contrasting information.
This is how this industry works and makes money off of misinformation, chaos and tapping into a “little” greed that all of us human beings have 😁😉
The simple answer to your question is: Buy an index fund with all US stocks and buy a second index fund with all international stocks. This will make sure your daughters will get their share of returns from the success of businesses all over the world. 

The art of successful investing is really your ability to control your emotions, make little mistakes and hold on to your wealth (not letting others eat away your returns little by little without you noticing). 
For your peace of mind, I want you to take the time and strength to STUDY a book by the legendary Jack C. Bogle called “The Little Book on Common Sense Investing”. That book will teach you up why investing is a winner’s game that guarantees you successful wealth-building tools while picking stocks/ mutual funds/ ETFs (aka hottest trends) is a loser's game that guarantees your greed will make others richer because of the mistakes you unavoidably make. 

Good luck to you! I wish you the very best in your investment journey! 🙋🏾‍♂️🤝"

2021-04-22 08:06:49,stocks,I did the same for my daughter.   I put some in the fidelity blue chip growth like you.  Also I put some in fidelity biotechnology.   Thinking is as a sector biotechnology over a long term horizon will di better than just a sp500 index funds.  And daughter can handle the extra volatility of the fund. She is 15 doesn't check fund or worry about volatility.  Told her to look at it when she is 50.

2021-04-22 13:18:20,stocks,"Because a bear market will fuck you out of all your gains. With that etf you’re basically trying to time the market. Losses greatly outweigh gains in funds like these, sure you might go up 300% over a few years in a bull market but then when you go -90% in a crash or a bear it will take another 900% gain to break even with your losses.

Most people dont like trying to time the market so they stay far away from 3X leveraged funds like that. Good-luck"

2021-04-22 13:29:09,stocks,Lol. I only buy it when I’m expecting a drop. Sometimes it takes a day or two but I just buy more until it happens. Bears gotta have their day too. Then I take those gains and feed the bull fund.

Im so sorry, i take it all back, theres no possible way that could ever backfire."
2021-04-22 13:33:49,stocks,I never sell the bull fund ever. Yes. The bear fund is a timed thing. But we all generally agree that the market will have its red days too. Have never sold it at a loss yet. There were a few times I considered but held and sure enough the next day it would print. It’s not a strategy for everyone but I like it and it keeps most days green or sideways for me.

Its not like 3x leveraged funds are only designed to be held for a day or so max.... *oh wait*

2021-04-22 14:04:59,stocks,Well. Looks like my SPXS and SQQQ are going to make a tidy sum today and I’ll close my position. Deep down I wonder if I should let it go one more day. But probably best not to.

Global carriers could face nearly $48 billion in losses this year as the troubled sector is struggling to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said.

The new figures, presented by the global airlines body on Wednesday, are around 25% worse than it had previously expected. It had earlier forecast a $38 billion deficit. 
The airline industry’s losses are expected to amount to around a third of what the troubled sector saw in 2020, when it lost more than $126.4 billion as the spread of the coronavirus forced governments to shut borders....

2021-04-22 08:46:23,stocks,"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Monday and Tuesday were false alarms. We are officially in the clear.

**Bull Case**

I think I finally understand the Monday and Tuesday sell-off.

* An [SEC ruling](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/staff-fully-paid-lending) gave broker-dealers until April 22nd to provide collateral that fully secures  fully-paid and excess margin securities.
* On Saturday, a tough [new SEC chairman](https://dailyjournalonline.com/news/national/govt-and-politics/senate-oks-tough-former-regulator-as-market-watchdog-chief/article_5fa7b3b3-3b57-5e8c-9755-e379ed8164bf.html) was sworn in.
* Saturday night, Redditors noticed that several financial companies were [working past midnight](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtgr19/a_breakdown_of_citadels_overnight_activity/)
* Monday and Tuesday, we saw a crash -- which I now believe must have been those financial companies liquidating assets to ensure they can comply with the new SEC rule

Yesterday, I predicted that the sell-off would be over by Thursday. I was wrong -- it was already over, which goes to show that I need to stop thinking I'm smarter than the market and accept that if I can see something coming, Wall Street can see it coming, too.

All this to say: the bull market is back on. [Jobless claims are lower than expected](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/22/us-jobless-claims.html), the catalyst for Monday and Tuesday's redness is over, and, so far, earnings season has been going great.

Today I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,062** and a **low of 13,950.**

When millionaires start actually contributing more and the government does what it's actually supposed to do, you have more money to invest instead of the chump change most of us throw at the market and hope we manage to make a few bucks from the same moves the elites do that give them millions.

> Back in 2012, just after Facebook IPO, a significant concern emerged among investors. Consumers were increasingly using their mobile devices to access Facebook (FB). Since the screen sizes of mobile devices were small, investors were worried about the monetization potential of Facebook's mobile users. As a result, the stock dipped to below $20 from the highs of $40 plus just after its IPO.

If you were a millionaire and had to choose between cashing out now before the capital gains tax increases take effect or leaving your money in the stock market, how long would you have to leave your money in the market for it to be worth paying the higher taxes?

The answer is **4 years**, assuming a 10% annual growth rate.

That's really not that bad, even if you are getting ready to retire.

Both SAP & Qualtrics raised guidance (SAP around 2 weeks ago and Qualtrics now). The long-term strategy really paying off for Qualtrics, the entrance to SAP customers worldwide is growing Q revenues exponentially, while still maintaining partnerships even with competitors of SAP (like SNOW). Will be interesting to see how it holds, seems like people are starting to see the potential behind it."

I've noticed a lot of negative responses to earnings, good and bad, across a few sectors, and KMI displayed the same general trend looking back at the last several quarters. I decided to make an aggressive option play based primarily on this assumed trend (along with a downward trend so I bought some KMI $17.5 /30 Apr 21 / Puts @1.32.

The great earnings emerged after close yesterday, AH action was hot and pushed the stock price up near my strike around the 17.24 mark. My puts opened this morning with a value around .90. Then today the stock actually dipped down to 16.36, and I sold the puts at 1.46 for a roughly 10% return. 

I could've waited through tomorrow to see if the dip continues, and I think it will, but I couldn't tolerate any more risk and will take 10%. So it was an interesting trading day watching the earnings response play out."

2021-04-22 17:27:08,stocks,"LOOKING FOR SOME GOOD IDEAS? 

If you’re looking for some good set-ups check these out.  Chances are they are breaking out or just about to begin a rally before they report. (Playing earnings is for chumps most of the money is made leading towards earnings or a couple of days after. Option prices & IV’s tend to be much lower vs on earnings day). 

- DKNG; moved all the way to the mid $70’s before collapsing back to the low $50’s formed a base and is picking up once again.  It will go into earnings at $65-$70

- DIS; the mouse has also been very quiet since reaching a new all time high just over $200. It was dead for the last month and finally started to gain momentum. Specially after HBO-MAX news and getting the Sony catalog. 

-JD.com; due to BABA it’s also been punished and hasn’t done shit in the last couple of months. Same set a base around $75 and reports in mid May. 

-T; AT&T has been dead for years and none of their business matter.  At this point it’s all about HBO-MAX.  Last time it had jumped over 5% on earnings news was over 5 years ago.  It will gradually creep up to $34-$35.  Cheap options.  

-NIKE; simply mid quarter drag and has been walloped by the recent hits to the DJI.  Sitting at it’s $128 resistance. So unless they announce any really bad news it’s already the cheapest it will be within its trading range. 

However do your own homework almost sure you’re agree in at least 2 of these. (For all of them you can but deep in the money calls for cheap and at least 1 - 2 months out)"

2021-04-22 15:35:56,stocks,I disagree. I would like to see more opportunities created to help people further themselves educationally and through their careers. I would like to see more focus on financial literacy being taught in schools. Perhaps fundamentals of balancing a checkbook in high school then learning to make your money work for you through investing in more advanced classes in both high school and college. Community college should be an extension of high school and public universities should be charging tuition prices similar to community college now. Taxing the ever living shit out of rich people to make us feel better isn’t curing the underlying cause of our blight. We all have the ability to take advantage of the exact same tax code. The difference is most average people either have no idea how to or do not allocate money into that realm. Nobody wants crumbs or to be a boot licker but we need to realize that there is a fix to our problems and it’s through education and opportunity not more taxation to a government that will do nothing but waste it.

Record employment, surging income especially for the lower income group, surging income for minorities. Also if Biden is confidant his spending plan  will work, no tax hike is needed because they will receive more revenue in the long run at Trump’s tax rate.  Lastly trying to impose global minimum Corp tax already show how worried they are from companies fleeing the states. This radical rise for capital gains tax will have the same effect. People will be leaving the country. No way international traders will deal with this crap. They will invest in foreign assets or crypto to avoid paying all the insane tax.

Even in the off chance that you do (and to emphasize, you won't), there is a class difference between you and the old rich.

lmao, you've been gambling in bitcoin too much. A 10% growth rate would be outstanding.

This also doesn't even include the cost of managing all that money. 

Let's account for inflation and peg it at three percent. Now the 10% return is 7% give or take. Let's also account for the cost of managing that money and say the cost ends up being a percent and change: now the 7% return is a 5.5% return. Now let's say the market enters something of a bear market a year or two from now goes sideways, but returns to form a few years after that: 3% return.

feels much better to be +$2k with no panic than +$500 with people panicing."

2021-04-22 14:18:33,stocks,One of my favorite things to do in life is visit these threads after something like this. The number of people calling out the next great depression is always so entertaining. Idk how anyone here makes money when they turnover their entire portfolio on a less than 1% loss on the day over predictable news.

2021-04-22 13:44:48,stocks,"Nope, it came down to tax increases from Biden (Doubled for the wealthy). What I find strange is that the tweets on the scoop only came out 31 minutes ago, yet the market had finished dumping by them. Possible insider trading, but who am I to say"
2021-04-22 13:45:03,stocks,"Exactly.  Just bought into a few before the dip! But they're already back to almost zero.

I should just start posting when I plan to buy stuff so other people can buy puts and profit."
2021-04-22 15:42:33,stocks,"So you said that Biden’s speech was bullish for ICLN and got downvoted and people said “no political talk!”?  It sounds like Biden opponents were downvoting you.  Why would Biden supporters downvote Biden’s speech being bullish on an investment?  

Also, I haven’t seen too many deranged speeches from Biden. So maybe that too."
2021-04-22 15:52:47,stocks,"The batcrap crazy posts about Biden are usually about how he should apparently be micro managing the market on a day to day basis to make sure they're never red.  It's idiotic.  Some people here literally think the market should be green all the time, there's some type of entitlement to make money among people.  In many cases it's people bag holding on speculative stuff like random Chinese companies.

The whole cap gains thing is contrived anyway.  No one you're ever likely to know will ever pay it."
2021-04-22 15:41:54,stocks,"Naw, you guys didn't give Trump nearly the same energy that Biden gets when red days happen. Only time I've seen it was when he called off stimulus check negotiations before the election.

Edit: At least today Biden said something that actually triggered the market, but any other red day where he says nothing, the same old ""I wish Trump were here"" comments get posted. It's annoying as hell, and I wish the ones who actually believed that shit would just sell all their shit and wait for the next election."
2021-04-22 15:43:54,stocks,"Honestly, it might be because of how ridiculous or doomer most of the comments I see referencing Biden are. A lot of the Trumper people just use any red days to justify their belief that Biden is going to tank the market, even though our continued ATH's suggest otherwise."
2021-04-22 16:21:16,stocks,"There's a difference between a message from Musk or Trump that's all opinion and meant to directly affect the market, and a message on policy. Trump got plenty of jumps in the market as a result of policy changes like the stimulus. The most recent stimulus checks under Biden didn't seem to have much affect on the market. 

There's no direct link with policy moves because other news and events can always overshadow what comes from the White House. It's a safe assumption that today was about the capital gains tax, but it's still an assumption. The market was fairly stable. It wasn't a huge panic. If Biden starts posting personal tweets about Gamestop though, then there's an issue."
2021-04-22 15:40:12,stocks,“Reddit leans left” compared to where? Fox News? Absurd nonsense comment
2021-04-22 15:40:10,stocks,"Not saying it's right but there are many who use the downvote button as a disagree button. It's not unique to /r/stocks, and it's not limited to political comments"

I definitely think SNSR will give the higher % of gains than those two, since they are dividend plays and mostly bought for their stable pay of dividend. So buy SNSR for gains with a little higher risk, the other two for stable dividend income and stable stocks"

Maybe I'm wrong, probably am, but I've heard that investments are handled through shell companies on exchanges in other countries and at any time their government can interfere with it. Like I said, probably wrong on this..

What I do know to be true, at anytime the Chinese government can come along and just take your company from you and/or shut it down with no notice over there. That alone is enough to keep my money out of their market."
2021-04-22 10:00:49,stocks,Interesting. I have a friend who worked at a few tech companies right after college and got arguably a small salary but they gave him stock. All those companies ended up going public and popping off. Pretty wild how every company he worked at ended up hooking him up.

Biden doesn’t give a shit about the day-to-day volatility of the stock market and he shouldn’t. He has a job to do. Powerful people want you to think that these tax increases are going to collapse things, but they won’t. People still want to make money.

2021-04-22 17:58:31,stocks,"One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch is a very basic primer for choosing stocks. Some of the information is a little dated (good companies aren't as cheap these days usually), but it's still a very good, easy-to-read starter book. Beyond that, I found looking at financials on somewhere like Yahoo Finance and learning what each part of the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement means little by little very helpful. 

Alternatively, you might want to forego all of that and just buy index funds to have average performance with zero input, just passive investing. Most people are best off just doing that (probably myself included). General idea is to pick a percentage of domestic stock market, international stock market, and bond market, then just buy and hold them with ETFs or Mutual Funds without doing anything, except occasionally rebalancing the percentages with fresh money or by selling the high one and buying the low one. Some products, like Vanguard's Target Date Retirement Mutual Funds do all the choosing and rebalancing for you."

2021-04-22 17:26:52,stocks,"I've looked this up in the past a few times but I feel like I'm still missing something by the way people talk about it. A lot of times someone is doing day trades, wash sales are mentioned. If someone has some time please help me out. Sorry if this sounds absolutely boneheaded. 

From what I gather, all it means is that I cannot report the loss from a sale as a capital loss on my taxes if I sell at a loss and buy back in within 30 days. If I do buyback in that time period , the loss is carried over as my new cost basis and the original holding period is added to my new holding period, so I dont really lose out on anything right? I guess I wouldn't be able to report my loss that year but the tax benefit of taking a loss is delayed until the year I sell the security and not buy back for 30 days. 

But for sales which include profits (like most of my sales 🤘), wash sale doesn't apply, and everytime I sell for a profit I am taxed on gains to be paid that year (if they're short-term I am getting hit every time I sell by the short term cap gains tax.) Me rebuying a security I sold for a profit within 30 days does not extend its holding period by the original duration. From my understanding, short term cap gains is the biggest reason to not sell and buy back immediately.

Isn't it kind of a good thing that you are allowed to repurchase a stock and not lose that holding period AND carry that loss along too?"

It's very inequitable that huge portions of the population can get significant tax breaks on long term capital gains \[as compared to other kinds of income\] that vastly helps the very wealthy. Most people don't own stocks much less make over a million dollars ever on them, and taxing people appropriately for those gains helps limit the widening gap between rich and poor."

Now I am making it a point to carefully exploit any day like this where positions I am lacking in take a notable drop. Won't blow all the ammunition at once but won't just twiddle my thumbs on each red day either. 

Getting cut by falling knives sucks but when the market decides to make an epic rebound, it does so hard and fast. Early March showed me just how fast a mega sale can vanish so I am gonna look to start exploiting them more readily but steadily too."

2021-04-22 14:46:54,stocks,"The problem is most Americans live from pay check to pay check and don't contribute much to the stock market. Increased economic activity ironically leads to inflation, higher interest rate, and a depressed market from the higher interest rate.

This is why the market surged during the lock down, despite unemployment being at an all time high and businesses closing left and right; but once the lock down is set to end, stocks started to tank as fears about interest rates rose.

Taxing the rich on capital gain will cause them to pull money out of the US market and into tax havens else where. The benefit is increased consumption from more money for the working class and also because it starts to make more sense for the rich to spend money rather than invest it when you're being taxed on capital gain. This will do well for profitable businesses, but not necessarily so well for markets due to the likely inflation and higher interest rates it'll cause."

It was all designed along with the Former Administration arguing with Jerome Powell for three years before the pandemic to cut interest rates in order to give the old generation one last bull run at the mortgage of everyone else's future. *Imagine if Former Administration got what they wanted from the federal reserve before the pandemic...*

It's almost as if creating a positive environment and paying officers well might have the effect of attracting better candidates that might actually help contribute to reducing crime. Defense spending could be halved if we would stop trying to police the world and require developed countries to pull their weight. We do need to maintain our equipment though and focus on scalability. Defense as a service comes to mind. In other words if we can scale our military to reflect times of peace vs times of war it would greatly benefit our budgetary problem. I was at Ft. Meade MD back in 2012 and saw ton of dilapidated buildings and wondered what was going on. Turns out that they would actually rather build new housing and buildings rather than repair existing facilities so they wouldn't lose their budget for the year.

Again, if you were investing since, say, your 20s, this would be even easier. You can invest less than $100 a month from your early 20s to achieve millionaire status by the age of 70. 

Also, assuming a 9% growth rate over a 30 year period is not 'a massive and honestly comical reach'. The S&P 500 index has returned an annualized rate of return of 10% per year since it's inception through to 2019 (that's before the crash in march last year.)

They spend insane amounts of money on militarizing our police with state of the art equipment to fight citizens rather than try to protect them. Putting the focus on better policing and a better relationship with the community reduces actual crime and takes away this mentality that police departments have where they chase conviction rates regardless of innocence. If the police want you to be guilty then you will be guilty even if you're innocent. Metrics push budget allocation but the metrics are flawed and self fulfilling. Politicians won't push this sort of agenda to decrease wasteful spending because voters have no clue what the actual issues are.

So far, however, just over 1,000 employees are said to have signed the contract with Tesla.

**The 40,000 jobs planned in the final expansion stage are also increasingly in doubt:**

""As it seems, Musk thought the number of employees in Grünheide then a little too big. Business Insider learned from government circles that internally the number of a maximum of 12,000 employees is expected - and for many years. Previously, it was said that 12,000 employees would be employed in expansion stage 1 of the factory. And this number would then gradually increase. Not even the well-meaning members in the state government believe in that.""

And because it's so fun for all the Tesla fans to be confronted with this ugly thing called reality, here's a little nice graphic visualizing the [price-to-sales ratio](https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A//g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/607139/car-market-cap-chart.png&w=2000&op=resize).

Just got my Charles Schwab account up and running. Don’t have much money, but like the #1 rule says: only invest money you can afford to lose

I do have $100 I want to buy some stocks! 

What stocks should I invest in? 

Or should I just keep saving (I’m planning to set aside $100 each month) to invest in stocks. 

What should I do, keep saving $100 and then when I reach (hypothetically speaking $500 or $1,000 invest it) or just invest the $100 now?

This way you can investigate if the people giving DD (recommendations) are legit, since you can se their portfolio holdings and how much their portfolio has gone up or down, and how long they have been investing. You can even see when people buy or sell - aka if people are all talk and no action. 

Example: You see someone hyping a spac, and see that they are in minus 70 % you get the feeling of a pump and dumb and that this person just wants to break even. 

You can also follow people who have staggering returns, and get inspired from them. Shareville will also rate your own portfolio based on its performance (after 3 months)."

My biggest issue with Reddit posting is the community tends to seem very rigid and strongly opinionated to me- even if that opinion doesn’t really seem to be based on much experience or genuine knowledge."

Motley Fool seems to just release a torrent of junk articles calling the same stock amazing and a dumpster fire over and over, then come around saying that they were always correct."
2021-04-22 07:28:03,stocks,"This is probably one of those 'internet rules' or whatever, but generally speaking subs that are more niche or focused and are smaller will have a greater feel of community, a lot less memery and more depth.

If you're interested in stocks because you want to make a lot of money and you don't care how, then yeah finding legit discussion is gonna be hard. And rightfully so, because if you show up not having done your own research, wheres the meaningful discussion gonna come from? What's to gain for someone sharing his or her insights if what they get in return are memes and uninformed statements.

Now I think a lot of people since the initial GME squeeze hopped on the investing train. Myself included. And we don't know shit, and these subs are the easiest to find. But it's like that with all hypes and subs. So what I'll do is once I read up a bit I look for a more specialized approach. Maybe instead of all stocks ever, I look into Pennystocks. Learn a bit there, dig deeper. Maybe I like the idea of investing in Cannabis. Go from Pennystocks to Weedstocks. Discover there's multiple approaches to cannabis investing and move to CannabisMSOs. From there I pick my favorite MSOs and find subs just for those! 

Of course you're gonna have the same problem in every sub, but my experience with using reddit for anything is use the big ones as an entry point and for fun and giggles, dig a bit further for, well, more depth."

Now, I just do my own analysis and I don't share it. I don't because it's impossible to have a constructive conversation with people that refuse to see the other side of the argument. People's investing strategy is too emotion driven when it should be fact driven. I'm not saying emotion driven investing isn't lucrative, it can be obviously, but it's too risky and uncertain for me. So I stick to facts and people, at least around here, refuse to even consider them.

2021-04-22 10:17:19,stocks,I’ve actually found it’s best to do your own DD and trust your gut. Most of my picks have been the best returns in my portfolio. It’s when I let myself get swayed by others who likely have a vested interest (including those here on Reddit) thatI lose the most money.

2021-04-22 07:45:23,stocks,Some brokers do a great job researching stocks. I’ve used Merrill Edge in the past and they had a writeup on a majority of equities I was looking at.   I think Schwab and Fidelity have similar research outlets too within their brokerage sites. Only catch is that you’d need an active account at them.
2021-04-22 12:52:45,stocks,"Agree with what you said Motley Fool. I subscribed. I think it was a total waste. Would be happy to share their info with anyone but they are pushing stocks that are overvalued, analysis is surface, very little useful information, etc.

Traderview - ideas section - I make sure to get a general overview, be objective and this is just an addition to my own research.

Macroaxis.

Steve Van Meter on YouTube - doesn't matter if you agree with him, his weekly roundup (Sunday nights) is a massive help in understanding what is/isn't/or may be going on with the markets in general and why.

1. Fool is pure 50-50 articles. Put out a positive article, wait a few days, put out a negative article.

2. Twits is a confirmation bias dungeon. Sometimes you find good info from someone that knows something that’s not in the public eye but it’s between a lot of garbage 

3. Subreddits since GME fiasco have gone to crap. Serious DD and discussion have been thrown to the wind with buzz words. Every drop in a stick is a shorty ladder attack and every gain is a rocket to the moon

2021-04-22 13:52:38,stocks,"Stocktwits is actually good for certain stocks. Mostly for small cap stocks where it's hard to find information on. Don't try to go to the Tesla threads though for instance. All you'll see are dickriders posting moon emojis.

Reddit is really noisy so I don't think it's a good source for pretty much anything with stocks unless you can filter out the noise a bit.

Agree with motley fool

My strategy is that I just go through the robinhood stocks lists until I see something interesting. I then do a quick thin slice analysis on yahoo finance, and go look at what people on stocktwits are saying as a sentiment indicator. If in my analysis I found that the stock is over shorted, an overly negative sentiment on stocktwits could be a good sign. 

This is exactly the formula I used to hit tenbagger after tenbagger going after short squeezes a few months ago. Unfortunately after gamestop, that type of trade has become too crowded so I have been treading water for a bit now trying to develop a new strategy.

Examples: PRTY, RAD, KSS, GME"

2021-04-22 08:06:30,stocks,"For me being relatively young I have 3 types of stocks I look at, Solid blue chip stocks, High dividend yield, and very speculative. most of my money is in the first 2. it's hard to filter through the bullshit especially online with TikTok. All these 14 year olds pumping some shit tier stock in order to have a 1000x gain while their portfolio is full of massive losses. When it comes down to it don't let anyone influence your decision making and take emotion out of the buy/sell process.  Look at fundamentals and if you believe in the Stock pull the trigger. All these paid services (Motley fool,  Discord servers, Subreddits, Seeking Alpha, and Tiktoks) all have an agenda. GME was a big example of this, Yes you might make 20x your initial investment but how many losers did you gamble on in the process. Fundamentals, Fundamentals, Fundamentals, Blue chip stocks with solid financials will almost always work out well. If you think we're in a bubble and there will be a pullback look at recession proof stocks, Inflation hedges. Look at what people will spend their last dollar on (Food,Shelter, Ect) and invest in those companies. You could go the route of copying what the US senators invest in, It seems like US congress is full of insider trading and they all get the important info days before an announcement is made.  In the end though I wouldn't put faith in what anyone in online message boards says about stocks, 99% of us are NOT financial advisors. You might get  good advice but others will be bad and they want you to hold the bag after they cash out on a pump and dump. For me I look at Finviz for technicals Great website with a lot of information. But don't take my word for anything i'm just a 25 year old fuck on the internet, lol. Do your own research and stick to YOUR plan Best of luck. Cheers!"

It's a call in show with a host and a guest analyst/fund manager. Some of the callers ask about some of the stocks discussed here. The guest analyst will go over the caller's stock in detail, financials, charts, buy/sell/hold, etc. One analyst per show covering a specific topic like NA large caps. About 10 calls/show, plus a few other segments - market outlook, etc. At the end of the show analyst/fund manager will give you their top 3 picks and why. During the show the host pulls up the top 3 from a year prior to see how they've done. There are some great analysts on there... you just have to find the ones that suit your style.

Some of my favorites Gordon Reid (boomer picks but incredibly solid - really smart guy), Bruce Campbell, Christine Poole, Rob McWhirter. It's nice to have some solid info and ideas when the market is being difficult.

STwits) which I don't even look at anymore , other than maybe a spot check if I'm looking at something.    SA has some redeeming qualities, but a LOT of crap their also - too much to week through.

The problem is , as with everything now, is that so much of the  info is pure BS, poorly researched, just rehashed from somewhere else, or just plain wrong.  I have a HUGE folder that I'm going to unleash in the future of TONS of date stamped articles from all these platforms (esp. SA because it's more detailed than say ST) , espousing certain traits of stocks (good and bad). and because I do a HUGE amount of my own fundamental research - I 100% KNEW BS when I read it.  Thus, I'll show , with proof, the historic research I have vs. the 'talking boobs' and how they made completely poor analysis and often 100% incorrect.

2021-04-22 08:48:36,stocks,"I pay for multiple paid services (and have dropped others). 

Amplitrade just emails a list of 10 stocks each month that you're supposed to just invest your portfolio in evenly. The service is good, beats the S&P by a lot, and is simple. Certainly no discussion or anything though, it's his algorithm and the email list, that's it. There's not reasoning or explanation, there's no email in the middle of the month getting out of any position ever, just the list of ten stocks.

7Investing is similar except it's seven stocks and you have to check their website instead of getting an email. I'm still paper trading this one mostly to see how it compares. It's similar to Amplitrade I think, but more likely to have stocks that don't have options or at least options with very low activity (I only trade options 99% of the time).

Motley Fool Stock Advisor definitely has a scummy salesman feel, but their stock picks aren't bad. If you can zone out the constant attempts to upsell you, the stocks aren't bad. My best gains last year were from a stock on MF SA that I didn't see mentioned ANYWHERE else. So for the cost, they are worth it to me to at least get a good list to consider even if I won't blindly invest in every recommendation they make. They're also a buy-and-hold style, which to me sounds more like ""if I hold long enough, eventually I'm right"" which a lot of investors have, but is not my preference.

Investors Business Daily Leaderboard is good and the most active of all of these. I think they usually have an eye on certain stocks and then when they move above a certain point it's their trigger to invest. The problem is sometimes this is after a huge move up which makes it look like you've already missed the boat.

Between these four, I trust Amplitrade the most. Not only is their style the simplest, but the track record since I've been using them has been the best."

I’ll read Bloomberg, yahoo finance, a little seeking alpha,-shit-the economist. I listen to news outlets, a little Jim Kramer. I friend a bunch of people on multiple social media platforms, analysts, investors and economists. Also the different broker apps have their own news feeds and analysts, and I use several (fidelity, robinhood, WeBull, SoFi, a couple others). My strategy has been to use what I think I know about epistemology to assess the different arguments made by the different people in different groups and look for consensus among those making the strongest arguments and are the least emotionally invested, or at least seem to have strong emotional control. But at this point, all I can say is that I’m making money. I’m an adjunct instructor who grew up broke, so the reality is I’m still the most financially stable I’ve been so for now, I’m pretty happy.

In the end, NO ONE really knows what's up so you just have to comb through the mess and pick out the gems.   


That being said, you should buy stocks in all the positions I hold long (ACTC/PRTA, LAC, RLX, VIAC, UWMC) and you should 100% sell short QS with as much money as you can invest or gamble.   


Also please convince your friends and family to do the same with ALL their money :)

2021-04-22 10:11:26,stocks,"Reddit is good, but honestly I feel like the tried and tested methods and lessons aren't that hard to find, and will often come up time and time again in good books. Cliches such as 'time in the market beats timing the market', and the general understanding that investing should probably be over longer periods, and not a couple of weeks, or months.

I know starting out, had I held all of my investments from 2017\~ and continued to invest, I'd be significantly better off (potentially 5-7x higher networth). Obviously this factors in the massive growth for companies such as Tesla, and all of the craziness from 2020. Not to mention selling off my bitcoin in march last year, to then see it go to the moon in recent months. had I held that, and the stocks, whilst continuing to buy more, I'd be a millionaire!

But you know what else I would be? A smart-ass know it all. Honestly, I feel like a lot of investors are just lucky. Follow the tried and tested methods, be careful, try to invest more into ETFs and have a smaller allocation of your wealth in individual stocks and exotic assets such as crypto.

Most importantly, keep learning, read books, listen to what people have to say, listen to what the people on the other side of the argument have to say, and then throw it all in the bin and go all in on GME options."

If a stock is getting discussed you're probably too late.  If you're not too late you're talking to shills.   Adopt the mindset that you're a marketing firm hired to raise the price of the stock.  Now look places that you wouldn't find worth your time.  When you find one where everyone seems smart.  You can probably have legitimate discussions there.

I've found interesting stock discussions on The Well.  It was the Reddit of it's day, costs a few dollars a month and is well past it's prime.  All the remaining people had to be intelligent enough to navigate the internet in the 80s and 90s and you're expected to use your real name."

I like getting both bearish and bullish arguments and reading up on the fundamentals before deciding to jump in. Is there a lot of shit out there? Yes.

Two of their recommendations (SE and MDB) I was up over 1000% earlier this year and had held for less than 3 years on each.  I've got others that 300+%.  The key is their recommendations are for long term holding.  If you want to turn a quick buck then Motley Fool is not the place you should look for information.  


If I had to guess, all the haters are turned off by the free articles.... maybe?  I don't ever read any of their free stuff unless it pertains to the stocks they recommend via RB.  In that context, the free articles are fine for me.  So people can hate it all they want I guess, but I'll continue to use them as a source and I'll continue making tendies while you sit at home with your thumb up your ass whining about Motley Fool."

You are in the fortunate position of being able to afford to lose your investment and more importantly in a position to afford not investing, most people need to invest either to fund a pension or as an endowment.

Do not buy single stocks unless you are a professional, as a rule of thumb do not buy single stocks if you need or even feel like you want to ask people what stocks to buy. Always take profits when markets are overheated (you’ll know they are overheated because you’ll find people asking questions like you are on the internet)

Looking at a mix of different communities is important! The same major news story posted on r/investing, r/bogleheads, r/thetagang, and r/wallstreetbets will generate *wildly* different discussions. Reviewing several different echo chambers and examining what seems most insightful from each can give good perspectives but you need to have a strong BS filter to sort out the hype.

I think the quantity of noise on a lot of subreddits relating to finances and investing makes finding useful information hard. The media is biased and not at fast at getting information out to people so it's not the best resource either.

More importantly, I think there are a lot of people desperate to learn and find resources and get information for people misrepresenting their skills and knowledge."

For example, I can pull up all sorts of data about companies, their earnings reports, their P/E ratio, do some technical analysis on the stock's past performance, etc. But unless I have enough knowledge to understand all that data and make smart conclusions from it, my own DD isn't going to be trustworthy. I think that's why a lot of newbies end up on these subreddits: because we want confirmation and opportunities to learn from other people.

2021-04-22 13:13:45,stocks,"> Agreed on Motley (I feel like Motley is focused on making bets then convincing their base to hold the bags while they exit, like Cramer using the base as personal bagholders).


Unfortunately that will happen to all popular services and forums. WSB has the same effect. When UWMC was popular on the WSB, it went up on that day and it has been going down since then. Same happened to the cannabis stocks, BB, PLTR and others. It doesn’t mean that these stocks were pumped and dumped. It means that WSB, motley fool, Cramer and other services have the scaling problem, which all big funds have. The solution is doing it like Warren Buffett: DCAing into the position and holding long term. Or you can sell CSP on the short term."

Just my opinion I don’t think it’s an accurate gauge of sentiment because those who post are most likely fans of a stock in the first place.
2021-04-22 11:28:51,stocks,Ditto on tips to research. I don't have the resources to analyze every company on the market. Reddit is a good place to start looking for undervalued stocks.

The reason? When you buy stocks there is someone that sells them to you, who prefers to have cash. Which seems odd if its such a good stock to buy. Basically implying it's bad to buy stocks as there's someone who's willing to sell the stock to you.

When I mentioned the same logic can be applied to index funds (which this person recommended instead) I got a longwinded response completely irrelevant to the initial argument this person made"

2021-04-22 10:56:57,stocks,I totally agree. And I like all types of discussion. But what bothers me is when you see absolute certainty in what appear to be active/new traders. Everyone can have their own strategy but I don’t like stifled discussion because someone or some group is so sure their strategy is absolutely correct
2021-04-22 09:59:20,stocks,Oh man I hear you on the strong bs filter lol I agree about seeking out different communities and opinions completely. I genuinely enjoy discussion so I don’t mind disagreements or opposing viewpoints. My only issue is when I feel discussion is shut down or ignored for the sake of either pushing a narrative or insisting there can be only one “right” viewpoint

Don’t get me wrong I am mostly a buy and hold type, but after seeing a stock price increase of over 50% I think it’s perfectly acceptable to reevaluate and either sell or trim the position. I found this was very unpopular on some of my other posts/comments. 

The same is true of the meme hype. Lots of sentiment about never selling, but then you can’t even make money from the stock. What good is a 10000% increase if you actually never sell?"
2021-04-22 07:08:01,stocks,I haven’t had a post removed in a little while. If I can fix it for something minor I do. If I can’t then I let it go. I found it’s easier to post in r/stocks than r/investing so I mostly do that. Sometimes posts also get beat up bad for reasons I can’t understand lol but that’s just part of accepting you are posting to a huge community with total anonymity.

2021-04-22 19:07:09,stocks,"I got into target, amazon, and Disney in March of 2020. Bought after SPY hit resistance 3 days in a row. Over 100% gains on those. Will get a lot of shit for this, but what the media was saying was happening in NYC and Italy was not backed up by case fatality rate data. At least the adjusted CFR rates. 

BA I rode like a bitch in 2018 and 2019 forget what my gain on those trades were but got in under 100. Again, media was saying BA was gravy after the first plane crashed. I sold before the second one crashed because media was saying ba was good I didn’t agree. 

When I first started trading, doubled my account  on shitty OTC cannabis stocks. Complete shit stocks but heavily manipulated. Literally would but a range of positions, wait for someone to manipulate the price up, and sell it. 

Also have lost a lot. Have not actively traded since March of 2020, just held positions. Ultimately I manage risk well, take a lot of 1%-2% losses and some 20% gains. My technical... reads we’re off so I just stopped trading lol. Bought a house. Waiting for funds to settle and getting back in, after learning from my mistake so 

If you think about it, if a stock is at an all time low, and you set stops a little past it’s perceived “bottom” the upside is huge on the trade every time and your losses are minimal.

Take a look at the top 100 S&P Components by weight and its about 40 of those. I tend to steer clear of health and pharmaceutical with a couple of exceptions.

I don’t do meme stocks. Excessive shorting makes them too volatile and unpredictable. These companies generally follow trends more easily. One exception is PLTR which is a hold and never sell for me.

And I only swing trade options. Buying calls when im bullish and its hit a low and then selling call spreads OTM when I believe its going to trend down

2. They have some level of volatility so I can capitalize on momentum trades. I ruled out GS, BRK.A, etc because they are basically straight lines up. Good long term but not ideal for swing trades.
3. I understand them and what they do. Clorox sells products I know. HSY sells products I know. They are proven. I don’t know what ABBV does. I know what Visa does. I know what SBUX does."

2021-04-22 10:42:17,stocks,"Honestly, you demonstrate a higher understanding of business, profitability and strategy than most Reddit. 

I'm surprised most can't see the irony and implications of asking for free financial advice."
2021-04-22 07:12:07,stocks,"Yes, a lot of memes and chatter.

It gives me an idea of market sentiment and momentum stocks to avoid. It helps me to be contrarian on a few issues.

There are occasional deep down analysis (not super high quality... but they try) on some stocks, esp on r/SecurityAnalysis and r/ValueInvesting etc.

Ofcourse there is bogleheads if you are an indexer and are happy with average performance.

2021-04-22 13:51:11,stocks,what a refreshingly positive outlook /s
2021-04-22 13:20:21,stocks,"Yes, I do all of that lol.   


My general strat is a mix of WSB YOLO (cashed out nicely on ACTC today), theta (sold CC's on RLX/LAC, and CSP's on UWMC at 7.50 which I don't mind owning), and boomer-ish holds.   


Realistically I am accepting a higher risk profile RN in order to ""catch up"" a boomer style nest egg of ETF/index and long holds.    


Each strat has an upside/downside and I feel like a smart mix is the best approach.   


Theta is great for consistency but little/no rocket potential(great for selling lotto tickets that never cash)\_   


Buying OTM calls and LEAPS is a lotto ticket/YOLO play and most DO NOT pay but some pay VERY well (WSB).   


Holding long (boomer way) is a tried and true method of wealth generation.   
However you kind of need wealth to really generate wealth with the boomer method (see high risk strats above for solution, or to add MASSIVELY to the problem ROFL)"

2021-04-22 07:34:27,stocks,"The same logic can be applied to anything for sale. If  whatever is being purchased is more valuable to the purchaser than the seller and likewise money is more valuable to the seller than the item being purchased well, we have a sale. Not only this but who knows, maybe the seller doesn't prefer to have cash but needs it right now. How many people you suppose kick themselves everyday for selling AMZN cheap because they needed the cash in the moment? Should people not invest in homes because the seller would rather have cash? Property? Commodities? The list goes on. That's one of the single dumbest arguments I've ever heard for anything and I hope you let them know."

I wonder if the recent GME and r/wsb hype (like over the last few months recent) has steered a lot of new people to these more serious subs as well."
2021-04-22 09:45:27,stocks,"This guy from r/personalfinance is basically arguing the seller must be infallible, but the whole point of active investing is that you think the market makes mistakes from time to time. 

Given the market is run by humans there are plenty of mistakes."
2021-04-22 13:28:10,stocks,"r/personalfinance is the most condescending community, they will freak out if you mention anything other than an index fund and talk down to you for making any financial mistakes. It can get ridiculous over there with the groupthink."
2021-04-22 07:36:44,stocks,"Dude a similar thing happened to me, I got told that Microsoft, Apple etc  are bad investments because “blockbuster was huge 20 years ago and now look”"
2021-04-22 08:40:04,stocks,"That reasoning is pretty solid, IMO. The point is that there is always someone on the other side of a trade, and they are just as informed, if not more informed, than most retail traders.

Yes, the same reasoning applies for index funds, but obviously it is far more difficult for your counter parties to have an edge when it comes to the long term direction of 500 stocks combined (or however many are in the index).

The lesson for someone who is still determined to pick stocks is to only pick stocks where you are more informed than the market (you have an edge), often personal experience or knowledge from your field of work."

2021-04-22 06:17:11,stocks,"maybe I just haven't been exposed to those subs long enough, I joined r/fatFIRE and r/leanfire about a month ago.

It seems to me though that on average, the people posting and commenting have more of a robust sense of real world financial actions, processes, institutions etc where as the meme stock posters on r/wsb and r/stocks type places are hyper-focused on share price. I would guess that leads to better analysis and discussion on average but who knows, just my newbie take"

2021-04-22 10:22:25,stocks,The people on r/investing and r/personalfinance are adventurers hacking their way through a danger filled jungle compared to those on r/Bogleheads.  I don't think the bogleheads manage to get out of bed most days.

2021-04-22 13:50:39,stocks,That might be your experience if you popped in briefly. Overall the community focuses on analyzing stocks that pay dividends and accumulating wealth over a lifetime. It’s the opposite of wallstreetbets. It’s a realistic way of starting that snowball of dividends. Everyone starts at different levels and portfolio amounts.

I really don't understand the bear case. You can of course repeat Blockbusters, which just shows you have no idea what business you're talking about.

For example, Netflix also was a real disk company once, before their digital transformation. I invested in it back then too, because digital transformations is where money is earned. GME has way more in common with Netflix than with Blockbusters, for example they are entirely debt free, so no risk of bankruptcy. 

Another one of those is Dominos. I invested in Dominos in 2009 for 9 bucks a share, and sold last year for over 400. Nike, same story, apart from that I didn't invest in that. Adidas, same story, but I did invest in that!

The divide between Boomers and Millennials is as large of a generational divide as humanity has probably ever seen, simply because Boomers are the last generation to grow up without the internet. They existed before internet+smartphones+constant ability to just look stuff up.

It's a HUGE mentality swap. It's the reason why millenials and younger generations don't have the same huge gaps that millenials and boomers do. Sure, the generations below millenials are all distinct and unique, but they're all generations with the internet.

The internet is the single biggest societal driving factor humanity has ever faced, and boomers are the last generation to be on the other side of that wave."

And they're able to reduce overheads and raise cash as they sell off some of their physical stores and move towards online sales. So the company is in good shape financially. 

Gaming is a pretty large niche with worldwide reach, and currently there is no go-to space for gamers in the online retail space, think the Amazon of gaming, not only console games (of which physical copies still represent a large percentage of sales, surprising analysts who predicted that full digital would have arrived by now), but gaming accessories, gaming hardware (PC builds, graphics cards, CPUs), and streaming/competition/e-sports etc.

Given the above, or until earnings reflect better cash flow for buybacks/div increase, I’d expect the stock to trade in a fairly tight range while slowly hitting higher highs and lower lows rather than breaking out quickly.

I like the stock and think it has the potential to hit $60 again in the next 5-7 years. I can wait that long & reinvest my dividends, so it’s a feasible strategy to me."
2021-04-22 05:37:26,stocks,"Even a recovery to anywhere near pre-Covid prices is enough potential upside for me to hold. 

I like the transition to renewables, but it does cost a lot. I'm hoping that it will work out well, between the quality of the people those two companies tend to hire for ""thinking"" roles, their in-house and collaborative R&D and analysis, and the fact that they're trying to make foresightful economic strategy decisions and have the in-house talent to put decisions into practice. 

Would not invest in pure oil companies for the long-term anymore now - if the political will holds, it's going to be a declining market over the next decades. With increasing technical ability to make the most of active prospects and maybe go for some previously unlikely ones, and possibly decreasing lease availability in some regions. Most of Big Oil is pivoting, and I can imagine that smaller players (who also don't/can't transition) will get squeezed out. 

China will prefer Sinopec, for various reasons including regional expansion of economic and soft power; what other emerging countries do, with growing populations and quality of life demands but less environmental concerns (so more oil appetite) may be key to which of the small companies does well globally, and that's too much politics for my taste."
2021-04-22 05:05:48,stocks,"I'm not concerned with the fact Shell and BP are divesting from oil. It shows they understand that oil will eventually be replaced by renewables, EVs for the most part. It will take many years but it will happen. 

There is definitely risk in failing to transform, being too early or being too late. BP is definitely walking a tightrope considering how aggressive they're divesting from oil alongside the high debt they have but that is part of the risk with BP. Key factor is that oil prices remain high enough in the coming years to adequately fund the transition while reducing debt for BP. 

At the end of the day they're still an oil company for 95% so they still have potential upside to oil, maybe less so than other supermajors but if you specifically want to invest in oil for the long term BP and Shell aren't it."
2021-04-22 04:50:37,stocks,"I had though Shell and BP has been investing in alternative 'greener' technologies for a bit now.

I would really hope they were not that short sighted to see movement away from so much dependence on oil."
2021-04-22 07:12:08,stocks,"I kept doing that without thinking and now RDSA.AS is about 50% of my portfolio @17, I do not feel like a smart man..."
2021-04-22 06:06:03,stocks,"Shell and BP are late to the party on renewables and are having to pay a premium to take down the barriers of entry. Expect Shell and BP to start picking up opportunities in already built wind farms and further divestment out of the North Sea. 

I’m not worried about Shell though, they are generally the first to make moves in the marketplace in terms of trend setting. It’s the smaller companies you should really be worried about (Marsthon, Enquest, Nexen, Taqa etc)

Speaking as a 10 year O&G profession who has moved over to offshore renewables"
2021-04-22 06:21:25,stocks,Shell doesn't know how. They tried to invest in alternatives but they have most of the money left over. And it wasn't much to begin with. They are mumbling about transitioning to consulting of finance or something like that.
2021-04-22 14:33:17,stocks,"They've been advertising as such. But not really made any serious moves.

The EV market needs electricity. Shell, BP, etc aren't electric suppliers. They have forecourts, but until massive advances are made in capacitor banks, etc, which will allow charging in moments they're pretty much useless.

The tobacco industry was wise, and diversified when the writing was on the wall for them, into food industries. Oil companies aren't seeming to be doing that."
2021-04-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Portfolio Advice for Young Investor Hello!   
I am thinking of drafting up my ideal portfolio for myself and I would love some advice considering I am quite young and inexperienced!  


For context, I am a very young investor with a high risk tolerance wishing for heavy exposure in technology with hope for high growth. For this reason, this is what I am thinking:

VOO (30%)

VXUS (20%)

ESPO (15%)

ARKK (15%)

Other Individual Stocks(20%)

Firstly, is my portfolio too risky with a high exposure to technology? Should I be rebalancing it to increase my position in the indexes? (I know I will be able to stomach large volatility/drops)

Secondly, I am worried about too much fund overlap considering I have many ETFs/Indexes. Should this be a worry? Especially considering the expense ratios. (However, from what I can tell, there isn't a lot with ESPO and ARKK at least) 

I would love some advice on where I should change things up. If this is completely terrible. If I should  be adding somethings. Let me know! Thanks!"
2021-04-22 07:11:26,stocks,"Well, half your portfolio is the typical large cap US / International split, and half is momentum plays. So you may want to consider what your goals are, if its long term investing through bear markets / recessions, you probably don't want half your portfolio in things like esports or ARKK. You probably want just a general growth ETF (assuming you want growth), something you can just keep averaging down in over a long period and you know it will recover eventually. But if that half is just play money and you want to make more of a gamble on the market continuing to run up, then that might be a good split between safe long term investments and YOLOs. Just be sure you are OK with losing half in the worse case scenario."
2021-04-22 18:30:36,stocks,"If you're brand new, first put all or almost all of your money in VTI/VXUS split 80/20 or 70/30 whatever floats your boat. More risk doesn't always mean more reward. Buying sector-specific ETF's or highly concentrated ETF's (like ARK) do not provide a higher expected return in line with the risk you're taking on because the sector-specific or individual risks are still relatively high and not diversified away.

Returns need to be normalized in order to be compared apples to apples. Hence, the term ""risk-adjusted"" return that you may see. If the expected return over the risk-free rate for Stock X is 50% in one year and for Stock Y it's 100%, but Stock Y is more than 2x riskier than Stock X, on a risk-adjusted basis Y is inferior. But most people don't think about that, they just think they're going to the moon.  


If you don't know what compensated/uncompensated risks are, I'd suggest you follow my recommendation before dedicating 50% of your portfolio to concentrated ETF's and individual stocks. Also, if you don't know what TQQQ or UPRO are and what the inherent risks are in holding them long-term, don't invest in them. Establish a solid foundation first as you learn."
2021-04-22 06:14:18,stocks,"I am also just a starter so very sound advice I can't give. You might want to swap ARKK with SPY. Or if you like a bit of action, include PINS and BOXL for shorter term."
2021-04-22 12:33:24,stocks,High risk tolerance but no TQQQ or UPRO?
2021-04-22 18:22:38,stocks,"Trash, just buy VOO or UPRO."
2021-04-22 12:12:02,stocks,"Ok that makes sense. So something like ARKK with a 5-10 year outlook is fine if Im okay with the prospect of losing a lot of it. if I believe in the future of eSports and video gaming, could an eSports etf be a long time hold rather than something as a gamble in the short term. If there is a large correction and I keep DCAing then it should be fine?"
2021-04-22 11:08:35,stocks,Best growth ETFs?
2021-04-22 12:09:21,stocks,VOO is an S&P Index just like SPY so same thing. VOO is better for long term holding though!
2021-04-22 15:46:13,stocks,I'll definitely look into those! Do you suggest simply adding one of them are replacing them with one of my ETFs?
2021-04-22 18:26:24,stocks,Thanks for tips. Noted!
2021-04-22 18:27:17,stocks,From what I use to think. Leveraged ETFs usually aren’t long term holds. Is this assumption incorrect? I’d love to know! Thanks
2021-04-22 13:00:02,stocks,"Yeah that is the idea. Even if the market crashes tomorrow, you can still make good returns by DCAing in over a long period of time and by rebalancing. But this works better with things that are near guaranteed to go up long term, like broad indices such as the S&P500. For things like ARKK, ESPO you could continue to DCA new funds but don't rebalance, that is don't sell your core VOO/VXUS to buy more if it dips. That would reduce your risk. If the market continues to pump and you make good gains on them you can take some profits and put it into VOO. That would be a kind of a win win strategy."
2021-04-22 12:13:24,stocks,Looks like you helped me more than I helped you.
2021-04-22 19:11:18,stocks,"So these are whats called ""leveraged ETFs"" where the value goes up a multiple of what the underlying index does. In the case of TQQQ, UPRO, and SOXL its 3x. So if the NASDAQ 100 (QQQ) goes up 1% TQQQ goes up 3%. It also works for declines where -1% is -3%.

UPRO is a 3x Bull S&P500 (SPY) ETF, TQQQ is 3x Bull QQQ, and SOXL is a 3x Bull semiconductor ETF.

These are high risk holds, about as risky as you can get outside of pennystocks and options. I've made money off them but for something like SOXL you need to be able to hold through a 20% loss in a day. 

Definitely do some reading on them first and don't go all in.

I'd personally swap out some ARKK for TQQQ or SOXL if you want a tech heavy growth play."

I see. Thanks so much!"

Short term it could possibly come down to a PS ratio of 9 which is what it traded at in 2019, which would be a stock price of around 180 I think, but I don’t see much downside long term, only possible downside is competition but I’ve tried out other platforms and I just think cash app is a lot better, it’s the easiest to use and it’s everything in one."

The merger date has not yet been disclosed. As a User of the app, they sent us an email on 3/22/2021:

We are following up on the letter below that we sent you on March 3, 2021, describing the anticipated public offering regarding Social Finance Inc. As a reminder, if you take no action and continue to use our services, you will be deemed to have consented to the ownership change and assignment, and your accounts will remain with us following the closing of the Transaction, which we hope to be on or about April 9, 2021. 

Sincerely, 
John Gardner, 
GM, SoFi Invest


EDIT: 
Here is the top part of the first email they sent:

You are getting this letter because of the anticipated public offering of Social Finance, Inc. When this happens a change of control of SoFi Wealth LLC, with whom you are a customer, will occur but your experience will not change. The account management, management fees, service, and oversight will all remain unchanged. If you do not consent to this behind the scenes change related to our public offering, you can let us know within 30 days. 

Summary: 
This communication concerns the anticipated public offering regarding Social Finance, Inc. (the “Company”). The Company is a leading next-generation financial services platform, and has entered into a definitive agreement with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. V (“SCH”) (NYSE: IPOE), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, to bring the major consumer-focused financial technology business to the public markets (the “Transaction”). A link to the Press Release is: 
https://www.sofi.com/press/sofi-plans-to-go-public. In connection with the anticipated offering, a registration statement has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and is currently under SEC review. There are no assurances when or if the SEC will make the registration effective. We hope, however, that the Transaction will close on or about April 9, 2021. 

The Transaction will result in a change of control of SoFi Wealth LLC and an “assignment,” as that term is used in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and in your investment advisory agreement (your “Customer Agreement” or “SoFi Wealth Advisory Agreement, or “Financial Planning Agreement” or “Digital Advice Agreement” as applicable, and, together, “Agreement”) with us. In accordance with your Agreement, we are requesting your consent to this assignment in order to allow us to continue providing services to you following consummation of the Transaction."

2021-04-22 00:55:43,stocks,Is it a concern that 4/9 came and went without any news since?
2021-04-22 06:27:53,stocks,It’s dropped a significant amount the past few weeks.
2021-04-22 19:50:03,stocks,SPAC scrutiny by the SEC is one possible reason for the delay. They also just bought a small bank which might also have some impact. Deal should close in Q2.
2021-04-22 19:52:07,stocks,SPACs have been slaughtered as a whole. I still think this is one of the better ones. They actually earn revenue unlike some SPAC companies. TBD if they will be profitable. I think they will.
2021-04-22 00:00:00,stocks,"How can a stock selling at a P/E of 75 with a growth rate of 20% be a good buy??? A certain well-known newsletter is pushing PayPal. PayPal has a P/E of 75 and the newsletter claims that PayPal will have a 20% growth rate going forward.

That's a PEG of 3.75! How can that possibly be a good buy, even according to their own analysis?

P.S. I wanted to buy PayPal 20-something years ago, but then they were bought by Ebay, much to my dismay. I hadn't realized that Ebay had ultimately spun off PayPal until now, or I would have bought some years ago and done very well. But with a growth rate of 20% and a P/E of 75, it seems rather late to the party!"
2021-04-21 22:04:05,stocks,Oh boy wait until you see SQ’s p/e and many other tech stocks with nonexistent p/e’s because they don’t make a profit.
2021-04-21 22:37:49,stocks,"The answer to your question, is its not a good deal. You can do significantly better elsewhere on a fundamental level. But stocks dont always operate on reality. I wont advise one way or another except to say that I wouldnt buy them myself."

2021-04-21 22:26:02,stocks,"I can justify a high (or even a non-existent) p/e to myself if it’s due to an outstanding management team, and they have a track record of making the right plays to stay on top in the industry.

PayPal doesn’t fit this description to me personally, and if it’s the well known newsletter I think it is then they love to recommend stocks that have performed well historically.   Any fool can say you should have bought Amazon at $20 and you’d have xxxx% gains today. Projecting that into the future takes a bit more thought, and once companies reach saturation or maturity it can be hard to sustain growth.

I don’t like PayPal stock, but if they continue to go out and make good acquisitions, or other innovation to maintain growth, then it could be a solid investment.   I don’t know all that much about their current plans, but I think their core business is a bit dated and has significant challenges from newer entries.   Most of the people I know prefer almost anything else to PayPal for transactions, and I’m of the same opinion."

2021-04-21 22:47:31,stocks,"But Square is prevalent in society.

I guess I've been using both PayPal and Square for years, and I don't see a path to that changing anytime soon. I'm willing to pay for that over your fundamentals (late edit - especially after the recent dips). That's fine to disagree because at least you have your methodology."
2021-04-21 22:13:18,stocks,"Ah, well I'm familiar with the idea of gaining market share and revenue instead of profits, with the notion that eventually, a company will be able to convert its market share dominance into profits. E.g., Amazon for its first twenty years or so.  


I didn't buy Amazon at its IPO, even though I loved them, because I didn't see how they'd ever turn a profit. I was close to right, but at the time, it wasn't on my mental radar that a growth stock could go for decades without turning a profit and still be a great buy. That lack of foresight is too bad, or I'd be rich now.  


But I'm not convinced that this model can work for Pay Pal. Though maybe I'm wrong?"
2021-04-22 01:05:33,stocks,">But stocks dont always operate on reality.

That is all too true! But unfortunately, not being very good at predicting mass psychology, I'm fated to being an investor who relies on fundamentals, rather than trying to figure out if I can dump the stock to a bigger sucker."
2021-04-21 22:25:48,stocks,"I have a hard time seeing PayPal obtain the kind of market domination that Amazon has been accumulating. And for Amazon, it's not just in retail, but also in cloud computing."
2021-04-22 15:37:42,stocks,"Or, invest in the shovels like the REIT STAG that rents space to Amazon.  I'm up 13.6% since I bought them on March 2, and they pay almost 4% dividends."
2021-04-21 22:24:25,stocks,"But the generally accepted metric for ""grow into their valuation"" was a PEG of 1. Maybe these days, with such low interest rates, 2 is an acceptable PEG. But 3.75?

If PayPal's revenues were growing much faster than its earnings, like for Amazon in the day, and the earnings were all being plugged back into revenue growth, then valuation based on PEG doesn't make as much sense. But that case wasn't being made for PayPal in this pitch."
2021-04-21 22:18:01,stocks,can you... summarize?
2021-04-22 13:11:28,stocks,Yes exactly! Well said
2021-04-21 22:29:54,stocks,"The P/E tells you the return on your investement. A P/E of 75 means that you are getting a 1.3% return on your investment.

If they grow really quickly, that 1.3% will grow accordingly, but a growth rate of 20% isn't going to blow that 1.3% up anytime soon.

As for comparing similar companies, with a PEG of 3.75, the only play can really be for market domination, and if that's what you're going for, there shouldn't be any similar companies that are likely to catch up."
2021-04-21 22:57:55,stocks,"Unless you are only making short/term trades or going for a company like Amazon whose strategy has been to plow all of its earnings back into becoming a world-dominating jaugernaut, then P/Es always matter."
2021-04-21 22:17:23,stocks,"For a growth stock, typically you want a PEG of around 1, not 3.75.  


Maybe the theory is that PayPal is like Amazon and reinvesting all their earnings into growth, so it can't be evaluated like a traditional growth stock. Instead, they are going for market dominance, which will eventually translate into large profits.  


If that's the theory, the newsletter didn't say so. And I have a hard time seeing it for PayPal, unlike for Amazon."

This seems WAY too vague for your own good, let alone to try to sell others on it. What are the other competitors that other people prefer? The only thing around here used other than PayPal is Venmo, by younger crowds... which I hope you know PyPl owns...

Online payments tend to be PayPal Flow in my experience but I guess we should both be researching numbers instead of guessing."

2021-04-22 13:37:43,stocks,"Tesla is more like Amazon. Completely disruptive technology with no viable competition in sight.  


PayPal may have been disruptive 20 years ago. Or maybe even a decade ago. (I would have definitely bought them 20 years ago, if Ebay hadn't snatched them up. In fact, it killed me at the time that I couldn't buy them.) Now they are just a mature company growing at a 20% rate with plenty of competition."

2021-04-21 22:17:14,stocks,"I think since the late 90s, the best companies demonstrate the value of intangibles, network effect, and the infinite scalability of the internet. So I have no clue if PYPL will grow into its valuation, but given the markets it has entered/could still enter, it’s not completely unreasonable. Not to mention its platform via network effect is more valuable the more people that use it. You can use the financial apps ecosystems in Asia as an example of what PayPal could be here: stuff like Alipay etc."

My biggest position is a micro cap magic carpet sushi restaurant (lol). Not on purpose mind you, but thats just how it ended up. 100% fundamentals play.

Like you, I dont do the high risk high reward game and frankly, I dont think the rewards are actually higher anyway. I think thats a myth when it comes to stocks."
2021-04-21 22:56:06,stocks,"That’s because Amazon has already dominated and you’re using past/current success to evaluate PayPal’s future, which isn’t logical. We have no idea where PayPal could go; the only logical thing you can conclude is the most obvious: Amazon and PayPal are two different companies doing different things in different spaces."
2021-04-21 23:53:49,stocks,"I agree with you, it’s tough to calculate fair valuation for high growth companies. I would  atleast look for top-line growth with a possible cash flow positive, if that’s not possible next metric I would use is subscriber/MAU/DAU growth and try to come up with net recurring revenue."

2021-04-21 23:06:25,stocks,"Yeah not financial advice for anybody here, I’m totally biased and just don’t like PayPal so that part should be clear.

Zelle and Venmo are used the most for individuals around here, and square or TransferWise for the work circle of people actually handling small business transactions.   I am aware that PayPal owns Venmo, and I’m kinda waiting for them to sack it with fees and suck the user base dry like they have with the original, before chasing the fleeing users with a new acquisition."
2021-04-21 23:32:43,stocks,"Not-profitable fintechs (BCOR) are in the 2-4 p/s range. Smaller profitable fintechs (MITK) are in the 6-8 range. (NOTE: MOGO, which is in the process of transitioning from not-profitable to profitable, has been valued everywhere from BCOR to SQ since the end of January.) PYPL and SQ have been hanging out in the 12-14 range. 

I don’t know how you’re judging what does or doesn’t “sound very good”, but it all paints a pretty logical picture when you piece it all together and allow a certain degree of “that’s just what this particular piece of the market looks like.”"
2021-04-22 08:05:44,stocks,"The market is basing the valuation on 0% interest rate. The future cash flows of the company are discounted using 0%. Which gives these an infinite valuation. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp

2021-04-22 18:51:13,stocks,"Wait a second. So you shit on PYPL for being mature but don’t call out the fact that not only is there competition but it’s increasing substantially for Tesla all over the world, their FSD isn’t even the market leader by a long shot in terms of capabilities and actual test miles driven, their current main product (cars) is in a very capex-heavy low margin industry, and their energy business has yet to be transformative to their top and bottom line? And you say Tesla is more like Amazon? 

I’m sorry man. I just can’t take you seriously. PS by most if not all valuation metrics TSLA looks more absurd than PYPL."
2021-04-22 00:01:49,stocks,"Live and learn. At the time, there weren't many examples of publicly traded companies that would wait twenty years to show a profit. And Wall Street back then wasn't known for its patience.

By the way, what's your point? Clearly, I've learned something from Amazon that I didn't understand twenty years ago. I said so above. Your point is to rub it in my face? Thanks."
2021-04-22 12:43:08,stocks,"Maybe, but that's not the argument made in the newsletter pitch. If someone wants to make that pitch, I'm all ears.  


Personally, that argument makes more sense to me for Square than PayPal. And Square has had ***huge*** revenue growth during the past few years, unlike PayPal."
2021-04-22 02:26:52,stocks,">My biggest position is a micro cap magic carpet sushi restaurant (lol). Not on purpose mind you, but thats just how it ended up

This is a chain of restaurants? Or you ended up owning most of a single restaurant? Is it good?

Did you read about that restaurant in NJ that has a market cap of $100 million? Unfortunately, I don't think that one has anything to do with fundamentals. It seems more like the modern-day equivalent of the company that during the dot com boom that did nothing at all, but changed its name to have "".com"" in it. And voila, it suddenly had a market cap of $50 million!"
2021-04-22 03:48:01,stocks,Any books you recommend?
2021-04-21 23:54:35,stocks,"I saw where Amazon was headed in retail more than fifteen years ago, and where they were headed in cloud computing about seven years ago. And I would have almost certainly bought PayPal twenty years ago if Ebay hadn't gotten there first, since they were a relatively small company at the time, with no significant competition, and plenty of room to grow fast. None of that is true today.

As for what PayPal's future is, I don't know, but the pitch was simple: PayPal is growing at 20% a year. The pitch made no claims at all remotely like monopoly domination of two huge markets. If that's their theory with PayPal and they're right, then PayPal would clearly be worth its price. But that wasn't their pitch. Their pitch was merely sustainable 20% growth."
2021-04-22 16:04:46,stocks,"For some reason, insurance companies traditionally trade at very low P/E's compared to the rest of the market. Many banks too, I think. But IIRC, not quite so low as insurance companies.

Why? I think I used to know, but I don't remember now.

Perhaps the low P/E's of insurance companies is the reason that Warren Buffet traditionally loved quite a few of them.

P.S. Aflac was a stock pick of Peter Lynch's circa 1994. I haven't heard any updates on his opinion of them since, though."
2021-04-22 01:48:04,stocks,"If that's the theme of the last ten years, then reality is eventually going to catch up with that theme, and there are going to be lots of bubble shards all over investors' faces, just like there was when the dot com bubble burst.

One can't compare the typical tech stock with Tesla. Telsa has a disruptive technology and is by all appearances, miles ahead of any competition. There were other such tech companies: Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple. But that's just a handful of stocks, and now that they are large and mature, their P/E's certainly do matter. (Less so for Amazon, since they're still working more on revenue growth than profit growth.)

To the extent that valuations have deviated from historical norms for the broad swath of stocks (growth or otherwise) over the past ten years, it's been because interest rates have been crazy low during this time period. When people can't make money in bonds, they have little choice but to accept lower earning yields in the stock market. When interest rates return to more normal levels, the stock market is going to take a beating, and no one is going to want to pay a P/E of 75 for a stock that is merely expected to grow at 20% per year."
2021-04-21 22:54:36,stocks,"Well, if you argue with a PEG of 1, you're arguing with Peter Lynch. But at the moment, when there's no money to be made in interest, then stock valuations are clearly going to suffer.

As for Philip Morris, PEGs are for growth stocks, which I doubt Philip Morris is. Philip Morris is selling at a P/E of 17, which in this market is a reasonable price for any stock that you expect to maintain its earnings."
2021-04-21 23:47:44,stocks,I appreciate you. Give me an award here and see how you pay. Mostly joking.
2021-04-22 00:52:56,stocks,">I don’t know how you’re judging what does or doesn’t “sound very good”

The two most proven ways to make money going long in the market are: (1) Buy stocks that have a good valuation. I.e., someday they'll be obviously worth more than you paid for them. (2) Buy stocks that you can sell to a bigger sucker. I.e., invest based on mass psychology, rather than fundamentals, and get out before the fundamentals defeat the psychology.

Since I have no talent for #2, I'm stuck with #1.

If it's the case that for whatever crazy reason, people are willing to accept a pathetically low 1.3% earnings yield on a stock because it's in the ""profitable fintech space"", then so be it. That's bigger sucker investing and is not for me.

The pitch for Square, on the other hand, would be nothing like a bigger sucker pitch. It's had phenomenal revenue growth during the last few years. (PayPal has not.) And perhaps is poised to dominate the point of sale for every boutique business. I don't know if that's the case, but I wouldn't be too surprised to learn that it is."
2021-04-22 12:15:45,stocks,"Yeah, I understand that historically low interest rates and the unprecedented printing of $trillions  is distorting the market. Unfortunately, this means that I don't know how to value stocks at the moment. I don't want to lose much of my retirement money should interest rates suddenly return to normal.  


Though I know the Fed says that they are committed to keeping interest rates low for the foreseeable future, I doubt that they'll be able to to stick to this if is ends up resulting in high inflation."
2021-04-22 12:24:41,stocks,"I just double-checked with Zacks, and they say the PEG for PayPal is 3.2, so clearly they are not predicting 50% growth either. In fact, they are predicting growth of about 20% for both earnings and revenue for the next two years."

My only claim was that I haven't seen such an argument yet, and the newsletter in question certainly didn't make such an argument.

As for Tesla, personally, I think its valuation is ridiculous. But that's a different discussion and not one that I care to engage in. Tesla is a completely different kind of stock from PayPal, if you ask me. I.e., it's just not a standard earnings growth stock.

Btw, my bread and butter of investing would be standard growth stocks, since I know how to value them in a sane market. I.e., a PEG of 1 is a good value. When I find a growth stock with a PEG of close to 1, I tend to buy it, if I understand what they do. Most of the money I've made in individual stocks has been in Apple, Microsoft, and Cisco, etc. And I bought them all at PEGs of around 1. So, I'm not dissing standard growth stocks either.

Is Tesla worth its crazy market cap? Hell no! But not for the same reasons that PayPal isn't worth its current market cap."

2021-04-22 02:45:27,stocks,"Yea, its a publicly traded company. KRUS (Kura Sushi). Its basically the child of a major Japanese chain.

Not trying to advertise them, nor do I think the current share price is wonderful but here is my synopsis.

The idea is sushi delivered to you on a pair of magic carpets. 31 locations, and approaching rapid expansion phase.

One carpet is always moving and offering you various treats while the other delivers on demand when you do a special order. These are common in Japan and are also known as conveyor belt sushi restaurants. You gotta love the Japanese and their efficiency.

I like it because it has a immense competitive advantage by automating the serving process (less servers needed thus lower overhead). It also does the accounting all at the table. You slide your plates into this opening at the table, and it spits out your total. You can pay via phone app or using the touch device on the table though I am not sure those still exist due to covid.

The only thing you cant get without a server is drinks though there is water and green tea at the table.

So basically a near fully automated dine in experience. Imagine how much they save in salary. Thats a pretty big competitive advantage imho. Plus there are literally no other major sushi chains in the USA so the market is theirs to take. There are tons of ma and pa shops so there is competition, but no major chain. There is a reason for that.

Sushi is a notoriously difficult cuisine to serve. It requires a lot more training and better paid chefs and most of the time, they are customer facing. This is very hard to scale. But Kura does have experience already and it looks like they figured it out.

Customers seem to like it because of the experience. Gimmicky, but hey, sometimes a change is fun. Food is not bad either and prices are in line with any other hole in the wall so no reason not to go for it every now and then.

There is one here in San Diego and prior to covid, they had lines out the door waiting for seating and its not like they have the nicest location either. Actually thats one thing I dont like about them. The location is actually not prime imho."

An extreme example of this is Rocket - it makes an absolute ton of money right now, yet has a relatively mediocre valuation. The reason is mainly because its a mortgage lender - if the housing market softens or rates go up, their profits will drop significantly. Also there’s not a huge way for them to keep growing from here.

Whenever I think about Amazon, I regret that day in the 90s, when they were still only selling books, with my mouse hovering over ""Buy"" on Ameritrade, and then I decided not to click.  


Back then, you could read a lot of books on stock investing and never come across the idea of a company that would intentionally deliver no profits for 20 years. (Except for certain well-understood things, like large construction projects with a reliable outcome. And they were usually funded by a company that had profits.)

Interesting. They actually used to have this sort of sushi restaurant in some malls when I was a kid. In fact, for a while, it was the only kind of sushi restaurant I ever saw. I guess because I was a kid and they were in malls.

They seemed very strange and Japanese when I was a kid. I haven't seen one in ages.

2021-04-22 17:17:15,stocks,">Well mainly because banks and insurers aren’t going to grow exponentially

Historically, non-growth companies (i.e., just growing at the rate of inflation, or what have you), would trade at a PE of 10-15. (P/E's are wacky now due to ultra-low interest rates.) This would give you a 7% - 10% earnings yield on your investment.

Banks and insurance companies would traditionally have P/E's that are even lower, giving you an even higher earnings yield. IIRC, during bear markets, banks and insurance companies can trade at P/E's of around 4, which would be about a 25% earnings yield!

I think that one of the reasons for these low valuations is that banks and insurance companies can be hit pretty hard when the economy is bad. And also, banks and insurance companies can sometimes go bankrupt virtually before anyone knows that anything is wrong, due to the complexity of their financial positions. Take Leamon Brothers and AIG, for example."
2021-04-22 12:09:31,stocks,"There are different kinds of stocks and they have to be evaluated differently. A pure earnings growth stock is typically priced on its expected growth rate compared to its P/E.  


Since the dot com boom, there have been a few companies that have been able to remain good buys based on no earnings, but great sustained revenue growth. Such companies clearly have to be valued differently. But those companies are more the exception than the rule, since in order for that to work, one has to believe that the company will eventually be able to carve out a big market niche that will be resistant to competition."
2021-04-22 00:22:00,stocks,"So, by your argument, Philip Morris is a great investment since its P/E is only 17, not 75. You've sold me.

Peter Lynch, btw, said nothing remotely like that you should buy S&P 500 index funds. He said that Wall Street is filled with sheep, and you can do much better than Wall Street by doing things like watching where your teenage children want to shop, etc.  


And I don't have any weird fixation on Amazon. I've merely used Amazon as an exemplar for when Lynch's PEG rule isn't the best rule to follow. They are a great exemplar because they are a counter-example for the growth stock model that is easy to understand. I.e., trading profit growth for revenue growth is sometimes a good idea, if a company can pull it off.  


My point is pretty simple, and yet you seem unable to comprehend it: The pitch that was made for PayPal was a completely canonical growth stock pitch. There are conventional methods of determining the value of a growth stock. My father-in-law made it rich, starting with only $5,000, using these methods.  


As I understand it, PayPal is not a good value according to traditional metrics for a growth stock. If it's more like Amazon or Tesla, then I'd like to hear that pitch, rather than the one that was made. Or if there is some reason why conventional growth stocks are suddenly worth four times as much as they used to be, then I'd like to hear that.  


But, during the dot com boom, I told my friend that it was time to get out since valuations were insane. He argued back that maybe the market had permanently changed and valuations would be considered completely differently going forward.

He recently told me that the biggest mistake of his life was not listening to me back then."

But if I had to valuate it, then revenue last month was $5m. So about $15m per quarter. That was with covid restrictions so we can assume it will be higher going forward. Maybe $6m-$7m. Not sure if they have any new locations coming soon but lets assume otherwise to be safe.

So lets assume average $6m/mo \* 12 or $72m rev the next year. Will probably be more but lets stay safe.

Current cap is $266m so a rev multiplier ($266/$72) of about 3.7x going forward (conservatively). Not horrible honestly when you compare to sector growth stocks. Heck that what brick and mortar restaraunts sell for locally (like when you buy a decent subway location). Stocks like Chipotle are way higher and their growth is no where near as good. I would say that this is an ""ok"" price based on rev multiplier but not a ""steal"" as it was during the covid downturn.

That said, growth is the key here. If they open, say 5 more locations in the next 12 months, then rev will climb another $2m-$3m each. Can they do this? They just opened 2 more last quarter and 5 the last 6 months and they do have the money (credit facility from their mother company) to do it but can they execute? I honestly cant find any info on current restaurant development. Maybe you can dig it up? Feel free to contact them if you want. They have an investor relations department.

These are then taken and inserted into various financial website databases so its usually easier to just look at the summaries on websites like yahoo finance or google finance or on your broker website. 

You will quickly notice that their profit margins are thin. Restaurants are usually that way but Kura is even lower than industry average though perhaps not sushi restaurants. The reason for this is food costs for sushi are higher than other cuisines hovering around 35% for Kura specifically. Pizza for example, is cheap to make and food cost is usually around 25%.

The food margin and labor costs for sushi are likely the reason why there are no chains in the USA. But this difficulty also gives Kura a huge advantage since they ""figured it out"" and allows them to grow unhindered (for now). Eventually economies of scale will come into play as well to increase margins.

2021-04-21 23:11:21,stocks,My intuition says wait till earnings. MSFT has ran up in past couple of months so there will probably be sellers come earnings.
2021-04-21 22:51:48,stocks,"To add what many have said, MSFT is probably one of the better priced tech stocks. That said, the tech sector is in a bubble and if they fall, they will all fall. Keep that in mind.

On a fundamental level, MSFT has some headwind. The shift to cloud applications is actually not good for MSFT which thrives on enterprise computing and windows software. A cloud based setup is a lot like the old mainframe and dummy terminal approach of old days and in this case, the mainframe is worldwide access. This inherently means that you can do without Windows Servers in a lot of use cases. What used to be a staple (domain controller + active directory etc) is no longer required and as applications move to the internet.

Internet servers and services (cloud) are easier and cheaper to manage. This is the main threat to MSFT. I know plenty of companies that simply use Google applications instead of rolling out Office. I know some companies who no longer bother providing a PC for everyone. That was unheard of not that long ago. Though I dont think thats a major threat due to office's legacy dominance, it is an example of how a cloud based app can replace MSFT software. There used to be a time when Outlook was a staple, now I am not even sure who uses it any more.

Yes MSFT itself is a cloud player, but Google and Amazon ate a ton of market share and other companies are trying to muscle in especially overseas where they have sentiment from their governments.

All in all, I like MSFT. I think they will be fine and I am sure they will keep buying stuff to stay relevant. But its not all roses and they made bad decisions in the past and are almost always a little behind the pack on innovations (though not as bad as IBM or Oracle). Beware of sector valuations."

2021-04-21 23:32:27,stocks,"I think this is rather wise, but let me pushback. There was always free Libre, and professionals can't even handle that Office clone.

I could never recommend to anyone with a workforce larger than 50, maybe less, to bother training a professional environment on something other than Onedrive if they're used to Office. Training staff is extremely difficult, don't waste your effort on that with the Office suite.

Now people tend to know Drive more, that is a very worthy competitor, except there's not a desktop solution. Enterprise has a long time before they actually prefer browser over apps.

You're telling me you know people who aren't working off laptops? Organizations of scale still want desktop or laptops. We have more than one per employee. The only problem here is that they last longer than before, but that's why we have more than one I guess.

If anything Microsoft needs to learn how to market, Teams is so much better than Zoom yet they lost that one. Teams is still the enterprise choice, however (in my work experience, admittedly), and Microsoft always has been more about enterprise than consumer.

2021-04-21 21:59:23,stocks,"Have my upvote because I agree and saw you had -3 already.   But in Op’s defense, Microsoft is uniquely positioned to continue growth through the next 10 years, and there’s not really a good alternative to the exposure it gives you.   I personally don’t own any aside from what’s in VOO or spy, but msft is a pretty safe pick that balances growth with risk, and maybe that’s all he or she wants right now.

To the Op:  I like to sell puts around earnings if I want the stock and think it may tank.  You get the premium plus the stock if you gauge it right, or just the premium if it takes off and goes up.  it can be a really good entry play against the high IV that comes with a pending earnings announcement."

2021-04-21 22:25:29,stocks,"Your principle is accurate, your examples are flimsy at best. Which is why people are right to spend some money on MSFT. 

The owner of DKNG could say something racist or political and permanently cut its valuations. 

When today’s 10-yr-olds are 13, their younger siblings could decide that Roblox is for old people and some new crowdsourced everything video game platform will become the new hotness. 

There are a near infinite number of finicky possibilities that could undercut your picks. In the meantime, MSFT will be busy growing 20-50 percent per year. 

Every year. 

Because dkng and rblx need MSFT. And the new shiny things that replace those companies will also need MSFT. It’s the premier shovel company in the tech gold rush."

2021-04-22 00:02:44,stocks,"Good stocks tend to be ATH most of the time. If they aren't, how does the market go up over long periods of time?

If you are fine with the market cap given the balance sheets, then you shouldn't try to time the purchasing. MSFT implied market cap is currently $1.97 Trillion. If you don't agree with it after looking at the balance sheet, then don't buy. If you think MSFT will be a much larger company in the future, then buy if you believe MSFT will return more than the general market."
2021-04-22 02:54:37,stocks,"This also was my dilemma in february, I was worried to buy close to ATH at 240. But today I am glad that I jumped in as we are at 260 so far. And I am ecpecting them to beat earnings forecast."
2021-04-22 00:02:35,stocks,"Yes legacy is definitely a thing. This is why I still like MSFT. Its hard to shake their foothold.

But what I am seeing is young companies using phones and tablets without any need for a PC. Exception is for people who actually have to write lengthy reports but not everyone needs to do that. Many workers just need access to reports, emails and corporate communication like Slack or similar.

I friend of a friend once called me to help with some IT stuff at their business about 2-3 years ago. They ran a... not sure what they are called... but basically they do loans for bail and such, and they have about 50 workers or so. But the entire office only has about 5 desktop computers and for funny reasons... one is just for powerpoint presentations, another to look at their security cameras and the rest are used by managers.

When you watch the workers, they all use their phones. Some use a tablet and they all just use google docs and actually do the typing on their phone (to my horror but young gens seem used to this and using dictation). They are able to do this because their applications and dbs are all cloud based so they dont need any sort of processing power nor much memory since it all runs on the servers and they just see the output. It is what it is. 20 years ago, each person would have at least one full wintel system and there would be a domain controller and some network equipment. Not any more.

Where I work now (programmer/admin), I would say that 25% of our guys really dont need a PC at all and the rest of us are remote... no need for any MSFT products in our organization for any sort of administrative purpose. We use Google for spreadsheets and tech docs, slack for communication, and our production is almost entirely Linux based. We do still use VS for programming and we release software for windows so MSFT still has a footprint but its nothing like it was 20 years ago."
2021-04-22 01:20:16,stocks,"Middle schools nowadays use iPad/chrome and google docs/sheets/meet, etc. The students now will be in future work force, and their experience would likely favor systems other than Windows. I develop using both Windows and Linux, and I prefer Linux as it is faster and engineer friendly. Microsoft may be still a good company to invest in next few years, but its glory has gone."
2021-04-22 13:43:02,stocks,"Yep legacy is a thing. Its why I still like MSFT despite the negatives I list. Its really hard for established companies to shift, especially bigger ones. They do at times, but its slow and by then, MSFT usually has a competing product so they just stay with what they know."
2021-04-22 10:00:37,stocks,What I’ve always heard them say is msft goes up before earnings drops after regardless and then it bumps back up in fallowing weeks. I would back test it because it might just be one of those things that people just think there.
2021-04-22 13:03:40,stocks,"People already expect good earnings and buy shares according to that belief, if they get what they already expected then there is no incentive to buy more or hold longer as they would feel there are better opportunities elsewhere."
2021-04-22 05:37:45,stocks,"I don't know why people think MS is *positioned for growth* or if that expression implies certainty like i understand it.

To me Microsoft has peaked in some areas and is driving growth in a lot of separate products, looking to synergize them like apple is. This horizontal expansion looks great on paper but it also puts them at odds with specialized companies whose job is to deliver solely on one front. Nadella's off-hands approach has improved decentralization enough to increase quality of products but whether they'll win their 1-1 battles against mighty competition is far from a certainty.

Buying MS is like putting money into AMZN, CRWD, WORK all in one and hoping they'll beat the compounded package with an integrated offering - which is fine, it's a good bet that's so far winning - but it isn't a guarantee.

The gaming sector in particular is very tricky and while Game Pass is a great proposition, we've yet to see a strong response from the competition on it."

A Peter Lynch video was posted just yesterday saying on average a stock oscillates 50% in a year up and down.

Rest of your advice is legit i suppose, if people understand the implications of valuation."
2021-04-22 00:10:48,stocks,"That's crazy. I appreciate you. Unfortunately, we are both going off personal experience (which can be valid and is a Buffet strat, right?) and aren't about to divulge where we work or anything.

Obviously I have email on my phone, but I hate it. Feels unprofessional. It's obviously way less efficient. I don't know what businesses you know are emailing off phones, they just sound really small, and not typically the Microsoft demographic in the first place, even if they did need more Microsoft in the past.

I'll bet on Microsoft using their cash mountain to learn advertising and do better in retail (losing to Zoom was unacceptable, but that's room to grow in the future, and Zoom also grew by being shady) before they really care about losing some small business hardware sales."
2021-04-22 01:29:49,stocks,"Yes, I would also guess the poster I was talking to is dealing with schools.

2021-04-22 08:36:10,stocks,"There are no guarantees, and I don’t personally own MSFT stock.   I do think it’s a pretty safe pick that will continue to grow though, and as someone else pointed out they’re supplying the technology that tech relies on.   I’m not that familiar with all the Microsoft game plan but I see future expansion and revenue growths in cloud, app hosting, military applications, gaming, and remote education.   They have the talent pool and revenue to be successful in basically whatever they choose to work on, I wouldn’t bet against them for sure."

Microsoft is enterprise, I don't understand who you are consulting or supporting."
2021-04-22 18:57:21,stocks,"You're still not making a valid point though.

Showing a 52 week period inclusive of a black swan event like global lockdowns arising from a pandemic cannot be extrapolated to infer a general rule of thumb. Surely you comprehend that. 

And MSFT is not even in the categorization that experienced that anomalous degree of volatility anyway (by your own table). 

It is much less surprising that, given the extremity of the macroeconomic backdrop, smaller companies would be de-risked and then reloaded in portfolios, as their bankruptcy risk and extended viability amidst what was initially a totally opaque pandemic response were much lower than massive multinationals like MSFT"
2021-04-22 02:28:37,stocks,"> yeah but what is a business doing if 

Most communication is internal... thats where Outlook had a foothold and now its practically gone. Obviously, there is a greater need to talk to coworkers than outside folks to get work done. It used to be that I sent 5-20 emails a day to various people internally. Now I send maybe, a 1-3 emails a month internally and its usually just to accounting for legal reasons.

Pretty sure person to person email is likely down a lot. Automated email is probably up as more applications are made but that doesnt help MSFT. Spam is likely up too but doesnt help MSFT either. But you are probably right that its up overall. I dont monitor this.

Teams is good but was late to the show. Same legacy argument applies."

I’m a teenager (almost 18, money saved up) and I am really interested to get into investing but I’m not sure really sure where I should start from.

 I just finished a normal book and I’m looking forward in getting something like a guide to the stock market. So far, I came up with:

 “The Intelligent Investor” but I feel like it’s a bit too old so I’m not sure how helpful it would be these days.

 “The Neatest Little Guide to Stock Market Investing” by Jason Kelly

 What are some of your tips that helped you when you were a beginner?"
2021-04-21 21:40:30,stocks,"Good for you to start so young!  Someone else asked this same question today. My favorite book is ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" by William J. O'Neil.  It will teach you basic fundamental and technical analysis.  Any edition will have the same info, but newer ones will have updated examples. 

 I reread the book or parts of it every year."
2021-04-21 22:29:59,stocks,"Contact T. Row Price. Open an account. NOT an IRA. Park your money in a growth fund. 
Congrats, you are invested. Any loss should  be minor and short lived.  It may even grow a bit.

Next. Get a job. Feel what its like to earn money.  Put at least 10% off the top into your investment account.

Don't buy stupid crap.

Now start studying the markets. By the time you are ready to invest, you'll have capital ready. 

Right now, at your age, you have zero idea why you should invest and are probably suffering from a huge case of fomo and want that easy money.  Sorry, its not easy. You need to learn what money is first. And that happens when you earn a living.

Most pop culture books on Investing by ""famous names"" are actually crap and are just sensational feel good pieces. Sadly, those are the books people will recommend. They have cult like (meaning insane) followers. And they are worse than useless. 

Search Coffeezilla in YouTube about what not to fall for. That may help."
2021-04-21 21:24:29,stocks,Binge watch YouTube videos from 100 different Youtubers. You need a diverse group of people and experiences to pull from.
2021-04-21 23:18:53,stocks,"Start with an amount of money that you dont mind losing. Then increase that a little to make sure that you take it seriously.

Start researching and buying individual stocks. Avoid funds. You will learn nothing if you invest in funds. Learn to buy individual stocks. Research their financials and sectors. Thats how you learn.

Books are nice, so feel free to read, but how do you know which book is good without frame of reference? You cant. Most business people are dolts and guess who writes books about investing? That would be people who arent particularly good at it. Thats why they write books... so they make money selling books instead. Someone really good at investing, is too busy making money doing it.

Invest in your own education. Learn it yourself. Once you understand the basics, the books become more valuable because you can at least gauge who is blowing smoke up your rear.

Recommended Order of Learning:

1. Simple stocks  
\- Businesses that are very easy to understand like food, retail, or basic manufacturing. Anyone can understand these without much education. This will teach you micro economics.
2. Financial Sector  
\- Slight more complex but instrumental to understand macro economics. You need to know this to get really good. Mainly know how banks work, both savings and investment banks and how they interact with government. This wont be easy but its very important.
3. Complex Stocks  
\- I highly recommend you go into sciences in college... because that is your intro to tech and biotech, both of which are highly profitable  IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING . I highly recommend you major in CS if you can for that reason, even if you dont intend to work in CS. You can do almost any business job with that major anyway.  
\- Learn about REITs. They are not hard, per se, but the way they make money is really weird due to depreciation. Their financial reports look wacky for that reason but this will teach you about real estate. This is an important sector.
4. Options  
\- This will teach you how to hedge. This is extremely important and what separates average from great. Buy some cheap calls/puts just to get some experience with them. Its ok if you lose... just dont sell calls/puts initially because that is risky.
5. Fixed Income  
\- you already got exposed them in the financial sector above. Just solidify it. Not so important these days due to stupid low interest rates but still important to the economy as a whole and you never know when they become profitable again.

Ex CS/Bus Professor ;-)"

Over time you will begin to process it all and realize they all say 80-90% the same thing, just different formats, strategies, interpretations, etc.

The most important things are learning what moves the market or a stock or the 10 year treasury yield or the Dollar index DXY - watch these indexes respond to news - it takes years to really get a “feel” for the market - talk to older investors parents uncles anyone who invests and pick their brains about their experiences good and bad - ask about the 70s inflation, 1987, the 1990 recession that never happened, the 2000 tech boom and bust, 2008 sub prime housing, etc - study these events in meticulous detail so you can recognize them in the future - find local investor groups - just absorb and soak information, learn how to filter data and information flow - 90% of news is meaningless you will discover - learning what actually moves stocks and markets is one of the many keys

2021-04-22 17:10:56,stocks,"Options are inherently more risky and aren’t suitable for most investors. As my favorite professor/hedge fund manager said regarding options: “don’t buy calls, don’t buy puts, don’t sell calls, and don’t sell puts.” No one can predict the market and its irrational behavior, so selling options is definitely not the way to go, especially due to the obligations that they entail."

But the point people are making is that this is not news. Now, you could argue this WAS news when the schedule was defined. But that was THEN. This is just the already-known schedule being slowly but surely executed.

What would be news is if Mark or FB abort/stop the scheduled sells. THAT would be news we’d love to see you present.

Put another way, if McDonalds in 2019 noted they would reduce their burger calorie count by 0.1% every quarter (similar to what is happening here with FB), you would not report that as “news” every quarter they actually did it. We already know they are going to do it, and we know the 0.1% is not material."

I work in real estate (broker) and own some properties and manage them myself.  I only work for close friends and family though. Not something I would want to do for a living. 

For about 5 years or so, I ran a small investment firm before i realized it wasnt worth doing it for others because A) they dont appreciate it and B) income isnt great unless you are willing to tell half truths or bold face lie or gamble hardcore. I wasnt willing to do that, so I shut it down. I still run investments for my family and close friends. I manage about $4m or so in assets though I dont get paid for it any more. 

Finance and economics jobs, in my experience, require a certain level of... shall i say... amorality to be highly successful. If you are an alpha or the type that has strong feeling of responsibility then you will do poorly working in this field. Those are not good traits for anything that involves any sort of sales or marketing. You need to be willing to take someones money even when you know they have better options."

Real way to play AAPL is to invest - hold shares, when it tanks buy LEAPs and ride it up.  Second best way is to buy options and sell into events and earnings.  I made decent money buying low IV 4/23 calls last Friday and selling before the 4/20 event, and I'm looking to jump in on IV crushed calls tomorrow or Friday and sell them before earnings when IV is up.

I don't own netflix but I'm bullish on streaming in general, cable cutting is going to keep booming. It has both generational and major geographical rooms for growth. Roku is my primary choice for exposure to the industry though, by far, because they have a much different strategy to the industry and have been completely killing it from expansion to advertising.

2021-04-21 23:20:41,stocks,so it's gonna tank more today. Ok got you
2021-04-21 20:17:14,stocks,">“We want to be part of the business community in Europe,” he said. “Selling some of our vehicles to make some money is not our ultimate goal.”

So, the goal isn't making money from European operations but rather being a part of the European business community and they'll just open one showroom in one country in September?

This plan appears to be less a plan to conquer the European market and more of a marketing exercise to boost their image in the Chinese market. 

It's actually a good idea, if so. Europe is 44 countries with different tastes, laws and languages. It's consistently rejected non-European premium brands. Europeans don't want American or Japanese premium brands - Cadillac and Infiniti both gave up and withdrew from Europe a few years ago - so it's doubtful there's much market for a Chinese premium brand. A full scale launch of a Chinese premium brand in Europe would be a costly fool's errand, but selling just a few cars through a minor operation would be good for Nio's image as Europe is well-regarded by middle class Chinese consumers. 

Another Chinese start-up, Qoros, did something similar a few years ago. They hyped a European launch, presented their cars to European regulators which received 5 star safety ratings. Then they opened a single showroom, and that was it. But it allowed them to tell Chinese consumers that European regulators like their cars and Europeans are buying their cars - even if just very small numbers from a single location."

Take a look. two days of 5% up, then days of 7% down, give it a week or so, then a couple days of 5% up, rinse repeat for the last month between 33-41 for NIO, and 30-37 for XPEV.

2021-04-22 00:00:00,stocks,"After 1 year of investing in stocks, I'm feeling confused and looking for advice. Exactly one year ago  I made my first investment. I have been collecting some cash to invest for the last couple of years,  from 2019 I kept hearing that crisis is coming.   


Even having zero experience in the stock market,  it was clear, that a big crash would be a good entry point. That exactly what happened after the covid selloff.   
I was really excited about cruise and airline stocks.  Royal Caribbean, Delta, Boeing were my first investments.   
After a couple of months, I relocated my portfolio mainly to tech stocks. The hype was huge. I couldn't resist, looking for new hot stock and jumping from one to another.  
Before the first correction in February 2021, my profit was around 50% , after it dropped to 40%.   
The market conditions made me decent returns. Not my expreince or knowledge. I realized that and decided to cash out my initial investment, relocating 60%  in cash. 

Somebody recommended ""The Intelligent Investor"" as a must-read for a new investor. This book was not an easy read and made me even more confused. There are literally no stocks, that would fit Graham's criteria in today's market.   
If Warren Buffet is his best student, why not just invest in Berkshire Hathaway and get ""the best"" value position in the market? 

  
What would you recommend to read or to study, that would be more up-to-date with today's market?  My next book is ""Margin of Safety"".

How would you allocate your portfolio right now? I'm still willing to invest that cash, just not sure how.   
I keep hearing that a big correction is coming.  


My portfolio right now:   
10% - weed stocks   
15% - tech stocks  
12% - 8 of ARK ETF's

2021-04-21 23:20:06,stocks,"If you think about your portfolio over a really long Period (10, 20, 30 years), it’s super hard to beat the s&p 500. So you’re probably best off having most of your money in something like spy. But I know that’s not much fun (I pick my own stocks for my Roth IRA). So if you want to pick stocks, I’d say have 15-20 companies or so (more is fine with zero commissions now). Pick stocks that have monopolies (Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon), the strongest brands (Starbucks, Disney, Nike), and stocks which are growing their earnings and their revenue consistently over time (United health, Home Depot). Plus maybe throw in some newer companies (just 1 or 2 or a few more if you want more than 20 stocks) that have hyper growth and you think will be dominant in 2030 or whatever (square, crowdstrike, Zillow). AI is good! (Nvidia, Tesla) And definitely have half or more of your stocks NOT tech! New investors seem to want mostly tech....you need diversity. Also, really try to have most of your stocks be on the cheaper side as far as forward P/E ratio. Under 30 forward p/e is good right now. And if it’s higher, at least have a lowish PEG ratio, like Amazon. Dividends are good too! Other stocks which will be great for many years to come are Linde, Deere, JP Morgan, Blackrock, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, PayPal, Lam Research, Chipotle, Visa. Do your thing! Make sure you’re super diverse and have mostly the biggest, best companies that will grow earnings and revenue for many years!"
2021-04-21 23:35:20,stocks,"I would not hold cash, I can tell you that much. Fiat currency or businesses, easy decision. Buy VTI and use it as your cash fund. If you want to keep a small percentage as cash, ok, but 63%? Yeesh."
2021-04-22 18:56:52,stocks,"I had about the same experience as you when I started trading. I joined a training program called Technitrader and they trained me how to trade. I would recommend them . They will follow you all the way through the course they even have modules that you can use to change your charts so that you’ll be able to see money flow and other items that will help you understand what is really going on. The woman that owns the company Martha Stokes as a certified master trader ,one of the very few in the world and she know what she is doing and has a great reputation.
I will also tell you that the stock market is really rough to trade right now
Because in the past four years all of the hype in the stock market has grown prices up well above what a lot of companies are worth and now they’re correcting back down to what they should be. To be able to make money in the stock market you have to understand when the big guys are trading and dark pools are buying or selling - it’s all changed. Good luck !!!!"
2021-04-22 01:17:38,stocks,"Having been invested in the markets for 7 years now, just like you, I tried reading ""The intelligent Investor"" in my first year. Looking back, I wouldn't recommend it, but read it later when you have a more better grasp of the market. The main concept you need to remember from that book is the margin of safety. Investing is all about risk management. Every year since I've started investing, people predict that this year the market will crash, next year the market will crash but no one really knows. The main important thing you need to remember as an investor, TIME IN THE MARKET NOT TIMING THE MARKET. You'll have to distinguish early on whether you're an investor or a trader and stick with it. I'm not saying you can't be both, but learn the basics of each side first. As for allocation, I have 
20% in SPY ETFs
40% in Value Stocks
10% Growth (Some may speculation) 
30% Reserves 

The books that are easy to read when I started are
1. The 5 Rules for Successful Investing - Pat Dorsey
2. One Up On Wall Street - Peter Lynch"

2021-04-21 20:03:38,stocks,"Little over a year into stocks, like you I made my money off the crash and now had to figure out what to do. Here's how I have my money 69.13% in mutual funds with 14.2% in TSCSX 25.25% in NASDX 29.68% in BIGRX I also have 30.59% in individual stocks 8.35% in VZ 4.7% in PGR 7.39% in PFE 4.44% in MRK 2.72% in DKNG and 2.99% in BXP. The portfolio is up 10%, bought mostly at dips, but they seem to be more few and far between nowadays, I'm not a genius so I dumped the ""crash stocks"" into one of each (large, mid and small cap) mutual funds. Mutual funds are up 10 plus percent the stocks I own are up 8%, if I can't make more money then the mutual funds I figured fuck it put the bread there."

I also bought the intelligent investor but I haven't read it yet. There are more basic books out there. Try 'Trading in the Zone' by Mark Douglas. It focuses on more of the psychology behind new investors and how to avoid some of the pitfalls. 

This is also a VERY volatile time. Personally I'm holding lots of cash and waiting for whatever all this is building up towards. Currently I have 50% 'tech' and 50% in small mining caps in Uranium, green hydrogen, rare earths and lithium."

2021-04-22 17:17:51,stocks,Peter Lynch's book One Up on Wall Street is really easy to read and entertaining too! Some of the examples may be old but it's still timeless advice. The youtube vids of Lynch are a good primer into what you'll be getting from the book.

Of that 20%, 5 is in penny stocks (like the latest meme currency). Currently thats SNY and ASX.

2021-04-22 08:40:53,stocks,I have nothing against it and people who buy it. My gripe was you being totally out of touch with reality stating it will replace treasury bonds.
2021-04-22 00:00:00,stocks,"My new investing strategy I hold shares of about a dozen individual stocks, all 100+ shares. Thus far I have been committed to a purely buy selectively and hold mentality. However I have finally decided to take the plunge and start selling covered calls. 

This week has been my first time trading options and so far I have made $1000 on premiums. I set the strike price at a point where I’ve decided I would be comfortable selling anyway (mostly around 40%+ gains) and the date several months out and then just collect the premiums. 

My plan is to now buy 100 shares of something new and continue selling covered calls. I don’t want to sell too many of my shares in my highest confidence stocks so ideally I would like a fresh set of holdings dedicated to options trading.

This was a huge mindset change for me from buy and hold. It makes me nervous thinking of the gains I could potentially lose, but otherwise I think the downside is fairly limited. 

Wanted to share and welcome thoughts!"
2021-04-21 21:05:51,stocks,"Why buy 100 shares, when you can sell ITM puts and get the shares at a lower cost?

That's the beginning of the wheel strategy.  

Just collect premiums both ways while being market neutral.

Once assigned the stock sell covered calls.

Then use your premiums to sell more puts.

The wheel is like a money printing press.  Of course there is the scenario where the markets plunges and your left sell cover calls forever while waiting on price recovery....or you can roll your puts to avoid assignment."
2021-04-22 00:00:25,stocks,What’s your strategy if you get assigned before expiry? Say next week the stock does moon and you get just peanuts? Just curious...
2021-04-21 21:53:31,stocks,"I didn’t buy 100 shares with the intention of selling options, but I do like that with 100 shares at any time you can sell a covered call to sort of lock in your sell price and/or make a premium. 

My strategy right now is to leverage my normal long term portfolio and selectively sell covered calls to earn premium and if a strike is hit trim my positions at a nice gain. If I were to build up my purely options portfolio then I might wheel"
2021-04-22 02:26:06,stocks,"I'm in a (Canadian) TFSA and you can't write CSPs in that type of account which blows.

So I just buy a dip and then sell the cc's, it's definitely not a wheel, more of a half moon, but it's been okay I guess.

Considering depositing enough into a non tsfa to set up a margin account for this purpose, but I don't like the idea of paying taxes on those gains when I don't have to on any other gains (tsfa).

Not sure what to do honestly."
2021-04-22 02:27:16,stocks,"It's not peanuts if he's making 50% on 50k, at least not in my world.

But I don't know if 2% from the cc's is worth giving up the possibility of a dirty move up."
2021-04-22 06:37:32,stocks,"I can’t really get just peanuts. Because the strike price already sits at a very nice increase from my purchase price. It does limit my earnings but I’m ok with that. 

So if MS moons and hits $100 a share next week, then my shares will get called away and I will miss out on some gains but will walk away having sold at an 80% gain from purchase. I do think that’s very unlikely though"
2021-04-22 02:23:36,stocks,"The worst that happens is you end up bagholding (the high risk people are talking about).

But otherwise, yes."
2021-04-22 06:39:06,stocks,Exactly. The 2% premium is small but to me it’s a weighted risk. I think the stocks making these big moves in the timeframe I laid out is unlikely. I collect 2% for taking that risk. And if the unlikely happens and my shares are called I’ve still sold at a healthy gain and I can now deploy that capital as I see fit
2021-04-22 06:47:14,stocks,"Agreed. But again these are long term holds. I’m not starting a new investment to sell ccs. That’s why I said these are already what I consider quality stocks that I doubt will have major value drops. So because I have a long term portfolio my options are sit on them and wait, or decide there are some I am willing to sell, set a price and collect a premium- knowing if my set price comes my shares will be called."
2021-04-22 02:18:05,stocks,"He's saying... You are looking for worse stocks so you aren't so emotionally attached? Why not just buy more of the stocks you have faith in, and then sell cc's in those stocks instead.

Don't be like ""I love Morgan Stanley! So I don't want to lose my stocks being exercised so I'm gonna buy archegos instead!""

Just buy more Stanley and sell cc's on some of them. That's the advice being given anyway, not my advice however I see the logic, and the hole in yours."
2021-04-21 20:49:41,stocks,"Lol oof I missed a whole 0. Well in that case I'm even more confused... you're doing all that work and tying up ~50k for almost a year to make 2% (1k in premiums). You're better off dumping the positions and going into an ETF if you just want to reinvest gains.

I understand your strategy but imo it's a lot of work that carries moderate risk for a small gain. You could just sell tsla weeklies way OTM and probably make more premium with a lot more wiggle room if shit starts to go south."
2021-04-22 06:44:45,stocks,"It doesn’t make sense to me. I don’t have capital to buy right now. All my free capital (not counting my cash reserves and other investments) has been tied up in my long term positions. I’m not really understanding all the advice saying don’t sell if you believe in he company, just buy more. You can’t buy forever and at some point I do think selling makes sense to either take profit or redeploy. 

So if my shares get called I walk away happy with my profit and with free cash to redeploy. If my shares don’t get called I collect premiums and use those to buy stocks I have less confidence in. I don’t want to use premiums to buy 3 MS stocks. I would rather use an extra $1000 to buy stocks I’d feel more comfortable turning over completely on a shorter term basis and that I can buy in blocks of 100 to continue selling ccs on"
2021-04-21 20:55:19,stocks,I think what’s getting missed is the premiums I’m making are not the goal. They’re gravy. I didn’t tie up $50k for the $1000 in premiums. But because I had confidence in the stocks. I’m selling covered calls because these stocks performed quite well and I’m ready to take profits if they continue to rise. So I set a high strike price at a buyout point I would be happy with. So I didn’t buy the stocks with this strategy in mind but based on their performance and my current situation I think this is the best move for me
2021-04-21 21:08:37,stocks,"Yea I get what you're saying. If you already own the stocks and will gladly hold them until they hit your strike then there is no harm in making premium from CCs and looking at it as found money or using it to decrease your average. I think what I'm trying to say is you need to account for length of option vs premium recieved vs time and effort. Yes you can make 1k in premium from shares you already own, but why do all that work when you can get way more than 2% over 9 months in a regular old ETF? Or write one contract a week for a high IV stock that will net you 1k? Just my thoughts from everything I've learned over the years about options trading.

Your strategy works and more importantly it works for you, so keep doing what you're comfortable with and I wish you luck!

Edit: Just checked TSLA because I was curious and yea, weekly's that are $55 above current price are going for $1400. That is insane premium lol"
2021-04-22 00:00:00,stocks,Thoughts on IBM? So I know IBM gets shit on a lot but I was wondering if anyone can tell me why exactly it’s a bad choice for a dividend portfolio? They seem like an ideal company to build around especially since the tech sector itself isn’t as strong in dividend payers as other sectors. Not to mention IBM cloud and quantum computing in general could completely revolutionize the world.
2021-04-21 20:58:12,stocks,"I am one of the biggest IBM downers around but their latest earnings impressed me and I would buy them more as a bet on Krishna - IBM tends to get savior CEOs when they’re near death.

The bad is their stock price is about where it was 5 years ago and 10 years ago. I’d rather have a growing company. Their earnings have also been on a downward trend over the last few years so you can only get so much dividend out of that. 

In tech IBM cloud is a joke. They will not be able to compete long term against the hyperscale CSPs. I think that’s why Krishna is spinning off their infra business. I do think they have a future as a custom solutions provider that uses cloud.

Quantum is a long ways off, I’m pretty biased but I also don’t see IBM a winner in this category because - riddle me this, what was the last technology IBM grabbed by the horns and took a leading position in? It was mainframes under Lou Gerstner nearly 30 years ago. No way their more agile competitors are going to let quantum go to IBM. Just look at how they did with Watson.

Anyways, I personally don’t touch IBM and that is probably my internal biases working against me because I’m in tech. However, I genuinely have been impressed by Krishna so far. If you buy them it is a bet on him to turn the ship. I am watching to see if there is an exodus of executives and if he starts cleaning house which they sorely need."

2021-04-21 23:48:20,stocks,"Ibm is a tech company, while other tech pile there hard earned cash into R&D ibm continues to take out additional debt to pay its share holders a dividend.  They carry more debt than Amazon, or Microsoft or google.  IBMs business model is in the wrong century and they can’t compete.  The rate of change of tech is increasing faster and faster and they will be left behind.  Why would you own a stock that pays a 5-6% dividend with little to no growth potential.  There yoy profit and rev have been declining for sometime.  Don’t smoke the Hopium there AI won’t save them, they are very far behind on that front.  You could own a tech company growing at 15-40% yoy and the stock does the same."
2021-04-22 11:12:53,stocks,I don't have the capital right now to open a position but I'm bullish on IBM - computing is going to change a lot in the next 5-10 years and they are poised to benefit with their huge investments in quantum and neuromorphic computing.

2021-04-21 21:03:15,stocks,"Yeah I think the way Krishna is positioning the company is they’ll de-emphasize their own infrastructure and provide hybrid applications for cloud/on-prem mix. He is already spinning off IBM infra which is smart. It is the only strategy that makes sense, this wasn’t a hard thing to see and can’t believe Rommety didn’t do this years ago."

2021-04-21 21:00:20,stocks,Totally agree with this. The only vertical I’ve seen IBM go head to head with the CSPs is government and that is only in very narrow contracts that require on premise that IBM is already servicing. They lose more of these more than they win but it is the *only* area I’ve seen them win contracts over the CSPs.

2021-04-21 23:47:30,stocks,"Yes, I worked there too.  It's often times big companies that trust IBM.  There's a saying, ""No one's ever gotten fired for going with IBM.""

IBM spends to much time, money, and energy winding down legacy systems with just a few clients on it.  Some of these legacy products and services were once successful.  Others never got too high of the ground.

I looked at IBM's price before earnings and thought it was a great buy then just because it was so cheap.  For years, I was wondering why anyone was buying IBM stock, so I'm certainly no IBM perma bull.  I don't IBM stock though.  My portfolio is completely growth."

2021-04-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, April 21, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 21, 2021**

Stocks reversed on Monday, rising on Wednesday for the first day in three sessions, with small-caps leading the way after a terrible run of performance in April. Despite Netflix (NFLX) sharply missing earnings expectations in terms of new paid subscribers, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ), while the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) remain near record levels. 

After a recent spike this week, the CBOE Volatility Index sank back to near 52-week lows, a sign that investor risk appetite is increasing. The VIX is known as the ""investor fear gauge,"" because it reflects investors' best predictions of near-term market volatility or risk. In general, the VIX rises during times of financial stress and falls during good economic times. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “The S&amp;P 500 has reached new highs while volatility has sharply declined. Low volatility has outweighed low correlations among stocks, driving return dispersion back below the long-term average. As the U.S. moves beyond key macro events such as the 2020 election, the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, and peak economic activity, we expect three defining themes for markets will be tax reform, infrastructure, and pricing power.”

While Netflix (NFLX) sharply missed estimates, this earnings season has largely blown consensus estimates out of the water, with more than 81% of companies that have reported so far beating earnings expectations, according to a study by FactSet. However, despite the largely positive earnings, many stocks (apart from today) have failed to react positively to the news. It seems as more positive economic data is released in terms of consumer spending and unemployment, it takes more and more impressive results to convince investors to pile into the stock. This suggests there is froth in the markets given the sky-high valuation of some companies. 

White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 vaccine as soon as Friday with a warning or restriction attached. The doctor said, “My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don’t think that’s going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment. I don’t think it’s just going to go back and say, ‘Okay, everything’s fine. Go right back.’ I think it’ll likely say, ‘Okay, we’re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.”

**Highlights**

* The White House announced more than 200 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine have been distributed in the US, greatly surpassing original estimates of 100 million doses delivered in the first 100 days of Biden’s presidency. On the back of this robust distribution, all states are beginning to open back up.
* Mortgage applications jumped 8.6% in the week ended April 16, marking the biggest jump since late January as mortgage rates pulled back following a surge, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). 
* Ford Motor (F) is planning more downtime at five North American factories due to a global semiconductor shortage. 
* During yesterday’s virtual event, Apple (AAPL) announced a new slate of products set to include the companies own chip. The offering includes a new iMac, a new iPad, and a new tracking-device called Airtags.
* Gisele Bündchen, supermodel and Tom Brady’s wife was announced as a special advisor for the CEO and board of directors in DraftKings. This is just the latest in a series of high-profile moves by DraftKings to establish itself as the premier sport-betting company. 
* After gapping up after earnings, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) joined the ranks of healthcare companies worth $100 billion or more
* After a series of high profile accidents including small children, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission advised consumer to not buy the treadmill if there are small kids or pets at home.This could affect the company's product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector. In response, Peloton (PTON) called the statements “inaccurate and misleading” and refused calls to recall their treadmill. The stock has been in freefall this week.

It's very amusing to me that you say I dont understand averaging down when you dont even understand that in order to average down you have to put more money into the security than you originally intended to.

2021-04-22 00:00:00,stocks,"$EGLX - The Best Opportunity in eSports I am bringing word from Canada about one of our favourite stocks that just uplisted to the Nasdaq today: **Enthusiast Gaming. (EGLX)**

This company has made us a lot of money eh.

I am here to tell you why I seriously think it is the BEST opportunity to make money in eSports stocks on the market.

# But the #1 thing you have to understand is that they are not in the business of winning gaming championships. They are INFLUENCER MARKETERS with a laser focus on gaming and eSports.

Here are some highlights for why you should check it out:

**1) Solid leadership.** They were founded by the owners of the Vancouver Canucks NHL team after the DOTA world championship was hosted in the Canucks stadium. The CEO (Adrian Montgomery) says the championship sold out the stadium with a single tweet and it was like Woodstock for gamers. They decided then and there that eSports was the future and they wanted in. He left the Canucks and now runs EGLX full time.

Source: [https://thoughtleadership.rbc.com/the-case-for-getting-in-the-game/](https://thoughtleadership.rbc.com/the-case-for-getting-in-the-game/)

**2) Very fast growing revenue.** While most eSports stocks are just a bunch of empty hype, EGLX is the real deal. The money is there and it's growing fast. As per their last earnings report, they grew their annual revenue from $15m to $127m in just 12 months.

Source: [https://www.enthusiastgaming.com/enthusiast-gaming-announces-127-6-million-of-pro-forma-revenue-in-2020/](https://www.enthusiastgaming.com/enthusiast-gaming-announces-127-6-million-of-pro-forma-revenue-in-2020/)

**3) Growing profit margins.** The earnings call also outlined that their losses are narrowing and they have drastically increased their revenue per user. RPV (revenue per viewer) was $0.52 in the last quarter, an increase of 100% from $0.26 in Q3 2020

Source: [https://www.enthusiastgaming.com/enthusiast-gaming-announces-127-6-million-of-pro-forma-revenue-in-2020/](https://www.enthusiastgaming.com/enthusiast-gaming-announces-127-6-million-of-pro-forma-revenue-in-2020/)

**4) Huge deals with real leaders.** EGLX has been taking off lately largely in part because of their announcements that they have been securing deals with huge clients. Clients such as:

* TikTok (*Undisclosed amount 7 figure marketing deal*)
* Samsung (*Official sponsorship of Luminosity*)
* US Air Force
* The Biden Harris Campaign
* Ubisoft
* Burger King
* and many more.
* (The CEO has also indicated they are currently responding to 7 figure RFPs and there could be more announcements soon.)

These are mostly marketing sales contracts, but with the Biden Harris deal it has never been explicitly stated (but heavily insinuated) that they facilitated AOC playing Among Us on twitch.

**5) TONS of diverse gaming assets.** EGLX should be thought of as an umbrella corporation that manages a massive pile of grassroots gaming channels, streamers, websites and teams. Their assets include:

* **7 eSports team licenses** in leagues managed by the biggest gaming companies:  

   * Valorant (Riot)
   * Call of Duty (ATVI)
   * Apex (EA)
   * Fortnite (Epic Games)
   * Overwatch (ATVI)
   * Madden (EA)
* **Like 100 fan websites** all delivering paid ad content. Some notable sites:  

   * IcyVeins (Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo guides)
   * FextraLife (Dark Souls and Souls like guides)
   * Sims Resource (Sims is the most female dominated AAA game in the world)
* **Several of the world's leading streamers and youtubers**  

   * xQc - The BIGGEST twitch streamer on Earth
   * Pokimane - The second biggest female gaming youtuber on Earth
   * and a bunch of other big names like Tyler1 and several other pro League of Legends players
* They are currently working on making a new ""one stop shop"" **eSports publication called UpComer**
* It has been hinted in past calls that they would like to make their own ""social platform for gamers"" one day.
* Their connection with the Vancouver Canucks, and therefore the Rogers Place stadium is a HUGE benefit. Which other eSports orgs have **unlimited access to a stadium**?
* Last and probably least, the also host the biggest Canadian gaming convention each year named EGLX. This is basically the PAX/e3 of Canada. It's not a big deal for the stock, but I think it's still kind of a cool little bonus.

**6) Ridiculously large social reach.** Last quarter they officially had **1\*\*\*\*0 BILLION TOTAL VIEWS**. In March their Luminosity eSports teams were the most popular teams across all of twitch.

**7) Relatively underpriced.** Enthusiast gaming is **ONLY TRADING AT ABOUT $920m USD market cap** right now. That's really almost nothing for a company growing this fast, doing $127m in annual revenue, in what is likely one of the next big emerging industries.

# ... and no I don't mean eSports is the upcoming industry. I mean INFLUENCER MARKETING.

\--

Finally, I want to discuss what I believe is the biggest risk to this company: loss of talent. Whenever the undisclosed contracts that streamers like xQc and Pokimane have with EGLX dry up, what's to stop them from going to a different agency?

My comfort with that risk is two fold:

1. The former CEO of a professional NHL hockey team knows a lot more about agent contracts then any streamer. This guy has worked with this exact same problem with professional NHL players in the past. I am sure he is being smart about the contracts and non-competition agreements etc.
2. I believe EGLX just needs to get to the stage of brand recognition that they can make stars and they don't need to find stars. They are in fact already trying to do this. Last fall they launched their ""RISING STARS"" program which is basically America's Got Talent for gaming.

It seems perfectly sensible to me that the influencer marketing and eSports space will soon be dominated by professional corporate agencies, not a bunch of freelance youtubers who have to take care of all their own admin, video editing, marketing, sales, etc etc.

I genuinely believe this stock is the BEST opportunity to capitalize on that trend."

I decided to really buckle down and try to learn as much as I can about investing.  I have learned a lot, and I would like to know how I am doing in performing my own DD.  I might have gotten some things wrong but that's why I am posting this so I know if I'm doing it right or I need to fix how I'm doing things.

I've tried to use certain things that would catch my eye to give me a starting point when looking for companies to invest in..  While looking on Finviz, one of the things I learned about in my self education, is looking for companies with a low P/E ratio.  So I started there.  Looking for companies with a low P/E ratio,  I came across a company I am familiar with.  Growing up in a rather heavy agricultural area, a company many are probably familiar with as well, is Seneca Food Corporation.  

Seneca Foods Corporation provides packaged fruits and vegetables in the United States and internationally. The company offers canned, frozen, and bottled produce; and snack chips and other food products under the private label, as well as under various national and regional brands that the company owns or licenses, including Seneca, Libby's, Aunt Nellie's, READ, Green Valley, Paradise, Seneca Farms, and CherryMan. It also packs Green Giant, Le Sueur, and other brands of canned vegetables, as well as select Green Giant frozen vegetables for B&G Foods North America under a contract packing agreement. In addition, the company engages in the sale of cans and ends, as well as trucking and aircraft operations. It provides its products to grocery outlets, including supermarkets, mass merchandisers, limited assortment stores, club stores, and dollar stores; and food service distributors, industrial markets, other food packagers, and export customers in 90 countries, as well as federal, state, and local governments for school and other feeding programs. The company was founded in 1949 and is headquartered in Marion, New York.

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SENEA. 

Going by a formula of anything with a P/E under 15 is good, SENEA has a P/E of 3.39.  The next thing I looked for is the Debt/Earnings and LTDebt/Earning ratio where anything under a .45 is good.  I found its D/E ratio is at a .25 and the LTD/E is at .23.  Next its the current assets to liability where anything over 1.5 is preferable.  It was at a 3.69.  Then it's to the PEG, 1-1.5 is good and SENEA is at 1.55.  P/S is next and it is good to have anything less than 1-2 and SENEA comes in at .30.  P/B needs to be anything less than 1.5 and it's coming in at .88.  Lastly is the P/FCF where under 15 is great over 20 is bad.  SENEA shows a 7.77.  

So far by these numbers that I am seeing, Seneca Food Corp is a pretty solid company to invest in.  Being one of the main food packaging companies in the US they will probably be around for a long time.  

What do you guys think?  Did I do a decent job of DD or am I all screwed up?"
2021-04-21 23:06:35,stocks,Thanks.  That was the main point to this stock was a value stock that is a safe and established company.  Nothing too crazy with a consistent rise in stock price.

If you’re not a Starbucks partner, at what price would you buy it at? At what price would you sell?

I’d like to hear your thoughts about SBUX."

It’s one of those tremendous companies that can charge insane $ from a commodity (coffee). Such companies are best for investment. My advice is to buy as many shares as you can every quarter so you dollar cost average over a long period of time and thank me later."

If it lowers your taxable income, it could be an even bigger discount than the 5%. 

For example, my first 401k took out 120 out of each paycheck, but only lowered my net pay by $80 because the money came out pretax.  


I wouldn't put 100% of my portfolio into the company I worked for, but free money is free money.  
I wouldn't consider Starbucks a growth company, theyre more like a bluechip stock. They're a huge, well established company, a leader in their market, with strong and stable earnings and they pay a dividend."

2021-04-22 11:16:48,stocks,"They actually have a schedule of when stores are supposed to be renovated based on wear and tear over the years as well as volume of the store. If a store is out selling its size, they’ll look for a new location. One of the ones closest to me just moved this year from a small corner cafe, maybe 1000 sqft, to the closed Burger King literally direct line of sight, 40 ft away across the aisle of the parking lot. Now it’s about 8000-9000 sqft and a drive thru and they’re one of the busiest in the area.

Compare that to the mallbux across the street from me (used to work at that one too) that’s stuck in a 500 sqft box and it’s way too much busy for it’s size. They were supposed to move but the water heater burst flooding the store and leaking to the store below it.. I think it was a Prada and ruined their back room stock, they sued and the budget to move just.. blew away.

If you hold for 1y+ it’ll turn into long term capital gains and you’ll be taxed 15-20% based on your income and it won’t apply to your income threshold
2021-04-21 22:54:04,stocks,"I just wanted to add to this (also ex-partner) holding the stocks long term can be a really good investment. SBUX has done very well, and split several times. They also pay good dividends every quarter (about .40 per share 4 times a year).

2021-04-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Lumen Technologies: An Old School Value Investor's Favorite - Notes $LUMN *Note to reader: This is a copy from my* [*blog*](https://brianlangis.wordpress.com/2021/04/21/lumen-technologies-an-old-school-value-investors-favorite/) *that I wanted to share. The notes are from my* *Seeking Alpha* *article on Lumen Technologies. I can't link the original article because S*eeking Alpha articles are part of our blacklist. It's not hard to find.

It's been a few months since my last write up on Seeking Alpha. Since October 2020 I think. You can read the full thing on Seeking Alpha. They hold the rights. Below are just quick notes and I suggest to read the full thing to get the proper picture of the company and opportunity.

Disclosure: I'm long Lumen Technologies ($LUMN).

* I found out about Lumen Technologies through a Globe and Mail article discussing Francis Chou's Stonetrust investments. [Stonetrust Commercial](https://www.stonetrustinsurance.com/) is an insurance company in the U.S. and like most insurance companies they make money through disciplined underwriting and properly investing the float. It turned out that Lumen is a large holding. Who still has a landline? Why would Francis want to own a dying copper landline business? I had to look to deeper into this.
* It turns out that the stock is a favorite of some [other old school value investors](https://dataroma.com/m/stock.php?sym=LUMN) such as Dr. Michael Burry from Scion Asset Management, Prem Watsa from Fairfax Financials, and Mason Hawkins from Southeastern Asset Management. Something must attract them.
* Lumen Technologies has 1.1 billion shares that trades at $12.70 a share with a market cap of $13.9b. Lumen distributes a fat 7.9% dividend yield or $1 annually which indicates that the market is not too hot on the company. Lumen distributes a fat 7.9% dividend yield. It looks safe. It's covered by free cash flow of $2.8b-$3.0. That's enough to cover the $1.1b in annual dividend distribution. Management has reiterated their commitment. Of course that's never guarantee, but more a signal of confidence to the market.
* The market is currently valuing Lumen at 5x adjusted EV/EBITDA, 8.2x 2021E earnings, and 4.7x price to free cash flow per share of $2.74, my preferred metric. This implies a 21% FCF yield. When it comes to a company like Lumen, that has a lot of debt and D&A, measuring the right amount of cash left should take precedence over earnings.
* The depressed valuation, a market revaluation of their core assets, an improved profitability profile and balance sheet, and potential growth is what probably attracted these value investors.
* Lumen Technologies, formerly CenturyLink, provides communications and network services as well as security, cloud solutions, voice and managed services. CenturyLink and Quantum Fiber for residential and small businesses. Lumen for enterprises.
* The firm owns 450,000 miles of fiber. It's one of the largest fiber optics network in the world. Most of it comes from their acquisition of Level 3 in 2017. It's a Tier-1 network. That's the network with the most connections. You need to pay for access. This is their competitive advantage. Lumen sells (wholesale) high bandwidth fiber optic long haul links to other carriers.
* Remember the old Internet as a “superhighway” analogy, well Lumen is one of the major highways. Lumen is among the largest network providers in the world. If their network fails, it takes jump a huge part of the Internet with them.
* Their massive fiber network and infrastructure acts as a moat. It’s too expensive to build and to develop it against the experts in the field. Fiber businesses are attractive because once it’s built, the “maintenance” or “sustaining” capex is relatively limited, and that drives FCF.
* The value of Lumen's fiber infrastructure network is not recognized by the market given the FCF yield of 21.5%. Lumen is looking to monetize their recently completed 3-year investment program and the 7.9% dividend yield looks safe. The downside is protected by the value of its fiber network (the cost to build a similar network is probably hundreds of billions) and recent large transactions for fiber peers were at double-digit EBITDA multiples.
* Lumen is the new name for CenturyLink since September 2020. The rebranding comes with a new business strategy that goes beyond just offering connection services. They recently launched the Lumen Platform to run cloud and edge computing applications. Lumen is betting that the platform will fuel growth.
* The Lumen Platform is a move beyond providing basic connectivity. It has the capabilities that go beyond providing just internet service. With the Lumen Platform, it will level its fiber infrastructure to provide software or other needs “as a service.” Practically, what we are seeing is the evolution from telecom company (CenturyLink) to tech company (Lumen).
* A lumen is a measure of the brightness of light and the name pays homage to their fast global fiber network foundation.
* It's a myth that 5G will not kill fiber. Instead it will enhance it's importance. 5G requires a lot more cell towers, a lot more bandwidth, and will need to be connected to a wired network. The explosion in data use, particularly mobile, could make fiber assets much more lucrative. 5G needs a fiber network that can power it through multiple contact points, and help it reconnect through physical barriers.
* Edge computing. Of all the new products Lumen is launching, the Lumen Edge Compute will be one of the main drivers of future growth. I think there’s a part of the cloud story that’s overlooked and that is edge computing. With the 5G rollout, edge computing is two words we will be hearing a lot more in the coming years. Edge computing places processing power closer to where data is being created in the physical world. Edge computing is a complement to the cloud by solving issues of latency, bandwidth, autonomy, or compliance.
* One great driver for edge computing is reduced latency (much faster computing speed means reduced waiting time). The more processing can do at the edge level, the less you have to rely on the cloud, and the faster the computing
* Lumen has a lot of debt and makes up most of the enterprise value of $45b. With debt there's what you owe and what you need to pay. They have been aggressive to pay down the debt over the years. Q4-2020 long-term debt stands at $31.8b. In 2020 alone Lumen managed to reduce net debt by approximately $1.6 billion and reduced leverage to 3.6x net-debt-to-adjusted.
* If I applied a price to sale multiple of 0.8x to 1x on depressed sales ($19b vs $20b actual), you are looking at a 9% to 36.4% gain. If Lumen manages to grow their sales, it will warrant a higher multiple.
* If we assume a 15% FCF yield (6.6x FCF), Lumen would return 34%. If Lumen manages to grow, it warrants a minimum multiple of 10x FCF, and this would imply a return of 115%.
* It won’t happen overnight. I don’t expect a significant short-term boom in revenues from their investments. This is a long term play. Instead I picture a slow rising trickle of revenue growth as the country upgrades the wireless network to support 5G standards.
* Three-pronged approach to higher stock price:

1. Market revaluation of fiber network and assets to more reasonable level. The cost and importance of building it should be the floor.
2. An improvement of the business. Growth + more profit + more FCF + less debt = higher stock price. Right now the market is not confident in Lumen. The mood is bad. Better results will change the mood.
3. Financial engineering. Selling off assets at higher than market prices to pay down the debt. Refinancing expensive debt at cheaper interest rate. Synergies from Level 3 acquisition. NOL that's in the bank etc...

* Ultimately, results will drive the stock price. Even with a conservative approach, I think there’s material upside if Lumen converts on the opportunities it sees and little downside if it misses. The negative is already priced in. Meanwhile you have an opportunity to buy a company with irreplaceable assets that's considered cheap on many different metrics.

This is the quick notes. The full article is on Seeking Alpha."
2021-04-22 13:42:27,stocks,"The $1.1b dividend is covered by $2.8b-$3b in FCF. As for the dividend. But what if your shareholder base is there for the dividend? The dividend is the reason why many investors are attracted to Lumens. Institutions, pension plans, funds and others are your big investors and they have a voice. Individuals too depend on dividend flow to support savings and investments.

In Lumen's case, there are reasons beyond monetary on why you should keep the dividend. Cut the dividend and risk lowering the market value of its shares by implying a weaker corporate financial outlook. It would sap the confidence investors have in management and the company. Dividend flows and share values are also positive signals to new investors — including bond buyers and bank lenders.

A 7.9% yield signals risk but I’m confident the company will maintain the dividend. The year 2020 gave you every reason to cancel it. If you were going to take a drastic move, like they did in 2019 to slash it from $0.54 to $0.25, and take a 30% market cap hit in the process, why not suspend the whole thing all together? I think they found a dividend payout level that is sustainable. Unless the business conditions really deteriorate, I don't see Lumen cut the dividend.

The company has committed the last two years to the $0.25 quarterly payout and has signaled their intention to keep it at that rate for 2021. The current payout appears sustainable based on both earnings and free cash flow. Lumen is expected to earn about $1.30 a share in 2021 and around $2.55 to $2.74 in FCF per share. That’s plenty to cover the $1.1b yearly dividend."
2021-04-22 08:45:59,stocks,I’d be interested in more of your thoughts as to why you think  “old telco won’t survive”?  What’s your idea of an alternative to point to point access for internet and intranet?  Or global back haul?
2021-04-22 13:46:28,stocks,"They are doing new things. I recommend reading the Seeking Alpha article but I can't link it here. I go in great details.

As for the rebranding.  

Going from CenturyLink to Lumen Technologies is more just a simple name change. A lumen is a measure of the brightness of light and the name pays homage to their fast global fiber network foundation. The rebranding effort across the company is a massive coming out party for what they have been working on the last couple years.

At the core of the new strategy is Lumen is looking for a return on their investment. Lumen has invested a lot of money over the years building their infrastructure (fiber, buildings, networks) and they want to monetize these investments. The investments enable Lumen to improve their revenue growth trajectory and serve as the foundation for several new strategic partnerships. Lumen has cloud partnerships with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and AWS. Lumen bolstered its edge capabilities through additional deals with [VMware](https://ir.vmware.com/websites/vmware/English/2120/us-press-release.html?airportNewsID=7fd33332-2044-46a4-a09f-8040269201fd) and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-cloud-satellite-and-lumen-technologies). 

More new things: The Lumen Platform that just came out. The Platform is the main product that Lumen is pushing to meet modern IT requirements. The platform is built on the top of their infrastructure to run cloud and edge applications. 

 The Lumen Platform is a move beyond providing basic connectivity. It has the capabilities that go beyond providing just internet service. With the Lumen Platform, it will level its fiber infrastructure to provide software or other needs “as a service.” Practically, what we are seeing is the evolution from telecom company (CenturyLink) to tech company (Lumen)."

2021-04-22 13:43:27,stocks,"Let’s work with the hypothetical idea that Lumen would suspend the dividend. That’s a $1.1b a year the company would retain. A selloff would occur if Lumen cuts its payout as income-hungry investors look elsewhere for their yield. If we put aside the knock-on effect on the market cap and business confidence erosion, what would be the upside?

The immediate selloff in the stock could create even greater long-term equity value by reinvesting in CAPEX and reducing leverage more quickly.

In the long run, one could argue that the cash currently used for the dividend could be better spent on business investment. For example, it could invest in providing more fiber connections to households, extending its fiber network to more businesses or more edge computing locations.

If they do cut the dividend, the stock would fall and provide an opportunity to buy Lumen. Lower cash payouts aren’t always a bad thing. In the long run it could increase the equity value of Lumen."

2021-04-22 00:00:00,stocks,"""Share borrowing"" is getting paid to destroy the equity you own Why isnt this illegal?

Nobody talking seems to be talking the implications for *every single individual investor*

In the days prior to the covid investment cycle, competitors shorted the heck out of disruptive stocks like Tesla. They took on real risk to hold down their competition. 

After GME scared the heck out of these firms being an uncontrollabke wild card, ""share borrowing"" was invented.

Essentially companies can short their competitors without risk of being locked into the short & becoming illiquid. All they do is call one of the offering brokerage firms and pay to borrow the shares. They can then buy out their position with these and fidelity returns the shares to the owner whenever at their leisure. Their goals accomplished both matter if they earn physical dollar count or not. In the end:

1. Broker makes money

2. Shorter makes money (maybe)

3. Technical structure and value of disruptive stock gets destroyed

4. Loaner makes a few dollars cash,

5. Everyone is happy right? Except loaner loses future value of their shares but isnt the wiser.

This is not just just slowing societal progress, its potentially murdering it.

For a roadmap into the who's who of disruption all need to do is look at the lists of companies brokers are asking to borrow shares for. Industries/commodities like vertical farming and graphene. In the last few months a few of these companies recieved spikes of higher short interest than GME at peak. 

I'll post a link to another I saw go down in the comments.

2021-04-21 21:22:02,stocks,Yes. You have to go check a box on your account to allow it I think (might be wrong about that it's been a while) but they allow trading from 6 est until 8 est. 24 hours for some things like SPY and QQQ and some other big ETFs. That's for stocks. Futures obviously 24/5.
2021-04-22 09:43:02,stocks,"Thanks. Well currently I can’t make otc trades because the money I deposited still isn’t cleared? It shows I have the correct available cash/buying power, but I still can’t buy. Is this a 1 time thing?"
2021-04-22 07:19:40,stocks,"Cathie Wood also pointed this out. It’s about opportunity cost and what is the baseline ‘risk free’ rate. If we can easily get 5-6% in a savings account, then we’d have to expect much higher return from equities, since they have greater risk. Thus this demands a lower PE. Another way to think about it is demand and supply. If stronger demand to keep cash / put in bonds due to higher interest rates, less money flowing into equities, multiples will contract.

Then the opposite is true. If investors have less yield putting saving cash, more will be inclined to turn to equities, multiples expand. 

Example - let’s say generally you believe equities may net you 5% per annum. If interest rates are 6%, it’s a no brainer putting it in savings. But if interest rates fall to 1%, this 5% suddenly seems very attractive and may justify the risk going into equities. 

Interest rates most likely (avoiding 100% certainty cos i’m aware i’m neither experienced nor a genius) have been deciding what is the ‘new normal’ for reasonable PE valuations."

Another is just that capital grows overtime while use for it doesn’t keep up. So the pool of capital is always racing to the bottom of rate pricing"

2021-04-21 21:20:09,stocks,">This. The p/e for the s&p is 40 right now. That’s bonkers.

That's trailing P/E. One usually actually cares about leading P/E, not trailing P/E, in deciding whether a stock is fairly valued. Unfortunately, leading P/E depends on analyst estimates, which may or may not be accurate.  


In any case, according to the WSJ (and backed up by Zacks), the leading P/E of the S&P 500 is 23.5, which while kind of crazy, is not nearly as crazy as 40.  


I'm not sure I believe the analysts, but with the Fed and government printing money like there's no tomorrow, who knows?"
2021-04-21 20:47:32,stocks,"I mean, speculative EV stocks have been beaten to an inch of their lives compared to where they were back in late January, so no, I really don’t think we are anymore. We might’ve been so back then, but it’s (relatively) slowly been deflating for the past couple of months. The only EV stock that hasn’t been bled to near death is TSLA, and idfk how you fundamental analysis on that stock (since it’s a stand-in for other ventures like SpaceX).

Regarding tech as a whole, I’d probably say the same thing regarding the more speculative plays — look at PLTR, BB, or SPCE, or ETFs like ICLN or ARKK recently. True, the NASDAQ is still quite overextended, but these stocks didn’t really recover with it to the same extent. I truly feel that the speculative tech/EV bubble has now been deflated for the most part."

2021-04-21 21:26:58,stocks,"But inflation drives up interest rates, and an excess of money supply causes inflation.

The Fed has been keeping interest rates down by buying government bonds. But that means printing money by the $trillions. It seems to me that this is a vicious cycle, however, and someday, we'll need a wheelbarrow full of cash to buy a loaf of bread, like what happened in Germany before WWII."
2021-04-21 22:22:01,stocks,And when was the .com bubble?  Lol
2021-04-22 02:43:52,stocks,"That's actually where I thought the post was going from the title. The difference between leading and trailing P/E is likely drastic right now, because we have a year of Covid behind us and a year many expect to be booming ahead."
2021-04-21 22:20:09,stocks,23 doesn’t sound too bad actually. Hmmm
2021-04-22 07:05:56,stocks,Does that mean that they expect earnings to grow 70% in one year? That's crazy.
2021-04-22 08:58:39,stocks,"Leading / forward PE is an estimate, based on a prediction of future earnings. If earnings expectations are unrealistic, that will be baked into both the price and forward PE, so its naturally lower."
2021-04-21 20:49:27,stocks,"But someone referenced a speculative bubble. Obviously the fact that more money has been injected into the stock market in the last 6 months than the last 6 years places a role in that too, no?"

2021-04-22 12:39:18,stocks,"Well, it's not quite that insane. The earnings of the S&P 500 declined steeply for a couple of quarters during Covid, so the forward earnings predictions are based on the pre-Covid earnings, not the last 12 months."
2021-04-22 02:12:18,stocks,"I'm sure it's messy. But betting against inflation when money is being printed in unprecedented amounts seems like a bad bet to me. If nothing else, eventually that money is going to work itself into real estate, and then people will need to pay more for rent and mortgages. In which case they'll either need to make more money or lead more frugal lives.

It can sometimes take many years before the chickens come home to roost. But they always do eventually."

Wiki them, great .com bust story."
2021-04-22 01:59:51,stocks,"To add to this, sales of their graphics workstations lagged with the advent of more powerful desktops. SGI repositioned themselves by selling servers that powered the early web and fueled the .com era. It was all great until the bust.

Ironically it was Jim Clark, SGI's founder, who championed moving SGI to the internet server business. SGI's board didn't see that way, and forced him out.  He would co-found Netscape with Marc Andreessen. Of course, it was Netscape's IPO that started the whole dot com era.

As far as their graphics legacy went, I think you're referring to SGI's GPU in the Nintendo 64. Their relationship with Microsoft had more to do with Microsoft's Direct3d and DirectX api. Plus, they open-sourced iris-gl, paving the way for open-gl. Applications like Maya, SketchBook and Blender all got their start on SGI's. Then there was the time they tried suing the pants off of a young Nvidia for patent infringement, but instead settled out of court. Nvidia ended up licensing SGI's technology, which laid the foundation for the company we know today."

Walked with a personal Iris and an Indigo. I missed the $1000 tag hauer watches they gave for Christmas that year, Their raid servers rocked. Everything went down the toilet after that. All I know after that was second hand info from friends calling crying their stock went to Enron levels. Many employees bought a ton of stock in those days. Your right it was NVidia who acquired their graphics hardware technology. And Microsoft acquired the software.

In reality market noise will hide that until you're looking at decades of data.

A bias in market preference or visibility should not cause a divergence, since the fund should be using all the funds except the published fee to buy underlying shares, which will raise the value of the other funds tracking the same stocks."
2021-04-22 00:08:15,stocks,"But why should they have started at the same price anyway (even if both ETFs happened to be created on the same date)? Like imagine a new S&P500 ETF is created today, so no expenses have been paid yet. What should the price of this ETF be? It can really be anything."
2021-04-22 00:39:34,stocks,They dont start at the same price. The divergence is relative to their prices at a given time.
2021-04-22 00:43:09,stocks,"OP seemed to be asking why SPY and VOO are different prices, but I’m saying that even if they started at the same time and had the same expense ratio, they still wouldn’t need to have the same price. An ETF can be priced at anything."

2021-04-22 07:21:02,stocks,"A bulk explosion of hydrogen that isn't premixed with oxygen is more of a deflagration. A poof rather than a bang.

When hydrogen explodes, it goes upwards. Gasoline sprays all over the place and coats surfaces so they can catch fire.

A rupture in hydrogen tank that doesn't catch fire immediately is safe within minutes. A rupture in a gasoline tank will be a fire and hazmat cleanup situation for hours or days, and if it spills on asphalt it dissolves the tar, creating a damaged road surface that can contribute to other accidents or pothole damage to cars for years.

The leakage problem is one of the big reasons it's expensive to adopt hydrogen. The fittings for refilling a vehicle have to be precision parts with common dimensions worldwide. Gas handles are basically a hose nozzle with eyeballed precision, maybe a few % as expensive to make and maintain."

More and more people are starting to realize that the money printers never shut off and the only way to combat it is to own assets that are profitable. About 10% of my income goes to savings, everything else, after expenses of course, goes to investing in solid companies that are profitable.

Next generation will probably do the same so I'm pretty comfortable loading up now while certain stocks are being held down because the future looks bright. If it does crash, I'll just not save the 10% that month and buy the dip.

My only goal is to retire early, the other option is to work forever and be on government assistance. We'll see what happens.

Jason Citron (the CEO and Founder of Discord) founded ""OpenFeint"" and sold it for $104 million in 2011. The guy was already extremely wealthy when he made Discord back in 2015 and is still extremely wealthy.

It's not like it was some random dude working as a normal software engineer that stumbled onto the idea of creating Discord. It was a well thought out plan to take Slack and create it for gamers."
2021-04-21 21:13:50,stocks,"Because not everyone is willing to sell their soul, their vision and ambition for anti-competitive buyouts.

Some visionaries actually believe in their vision, take pride in their work and aren't going to give in just because a competitor threw cash at them. With the right person at the helm, your company can be far bigger and ambitious than anything a buyer would evaluate it at."
2021-04-21 21:37:57,stocks,"Timing. Microsoft almost bought Slack, I think for $8B, some years ago. They turned around and eventually got acquired for $30B by Salesforce several years down the road. 

Not every new and tiny company needs to be sold to an old corporate behemoth. Chalking it up to a single person's emotional attachment is likely too simplistic a view in this case."

2021-04-21 20:54:09,stocks,"The alternative is figuring out how to successfully monetize the service without ruining it. I suspect their best bet would be a migration to a multi-tier subscription model for various tiers. 

Things like caps on the archive size of free servers, with paid options for larger servers, business operated servers, etc. Perhaps allow large community servers to have a donation tool where the community can pitch in for the server fee whenever they want.

The real key things to keep around are the free basic servers that groups of friends can easily set up and free calling/video/streaming. 

They could (and should) look towards vastly expanding their streaming infrastructure to cater to public/community streaming more. Twitch-like browsing interface, subs they keep a chunk of, etc."

2021-04-22 09:47:39,stocks,I'm in my 30s and have friends servers just to share stuff and keep in touch too. It's more versatile than a group chat

Sure, they say they embrace open standards and whatnot, but their software works ""best"" with other Microsoft products.  As an enterprise, you cannot simply change technologies without untangling Microsoft products.  Their licensing tactics are also designed to keep customers dependent on existing Microsoft software and hook you on new services (the first one is always free!).

I've worked in IT for almost 30 years and have seen their message change, but the tactics continue unabated."
2021-04-22 11:22:26,stocks,"This is what they want you to believe.  Microsoft's entire ecosystem is designed the be inescapable.  Microsoft is still anti-competitive, but they are much better at hiding it than they used to be."

These are but a few of the issues our company has with Teams. It really strikes me as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)."

2021-04-22 02:10:20,stocks,"> I don't see why discord users would refuse to switch.

Nobody wants to have all those running at the same time on their computer. Chat users have no loyalty to the app, but they have loyalty to ""that's where all my friends are"". If you want to quit facebook and use google plus, you'll have to convince all your friends. Then convince all their friends. Then convince the friends of friends."
2021-04-22 13:59:15,stocks,"I'm in this boat. I recently signed up to Discord after years and years of knowing about it simply because I wanted a private chat system/app, and others I was interested in chatting with were already on Discord. I really dislike how uncustomizable the UI is.

It has a ton of integration/features, but adding software features is easy. I've used video/voice calling and checked out streams on servers, but see no reason these features cannot be put in to a different app. Popularity is the hurdle IMO, as it was with Mixer vs Twitch."
2021-04-21 21:05:55,stocks,"Speak for yourself. MS has consistently shown that they are horrible at fostering products that builds a community or competing in markets where they can't bully their way into position with their B2B office/windows monopoly. 

It speaks volumes that the biggest consumer facing MS products have all been through acquisitions (LinkedIn, Github, Minecraft), with even MS admitting that their only hope is buying communities rather than building them (Pinterest, TikTok, Discord). 

MS has the tech capability to compete with Discord (teams, skype) and yet they can't because their product design is often a disaster."

I've been using it since Jan last year and can search for everything, so I am not sure what settings your org has put on the software or if it is user error.

Laggy chat might be a slow chat setting (if that exists on MS Teams) or shitty connection to the internet. I don't know anyone at my work who has had that issue or brought it up. You can reply to individual messages on desktop, I do it daily. If the app crashes that might be an installation error or inadequate specs for the machine, again don't know any user who has that issue in my org. MS Teams is a powerhouse if you pair it with the meeting ability. Plus being able to message people directly in a team outside your organization is invaluable and innovative."

2021-04-21 20:28:13,stocks,I don't think they're too upset about missing out on that market. The amount of revenue twitch brings in is probably pennies compared to Enterprise sales and Microsoft's/Amazon's cloud services

eventually, a long time later, when voice chatting became ubiqutous enough that even msn messenger had voice chat. How many skype competitors died while waiting for users to be ready to abandon ancient chat systems? People were still trying to log into ancient icq accounts in late 2000s to get a hold of someone they only had as a contact there and nowhere else.

2021-04-22 04:34:35,stocks,"She has a good product but in the world of investing 5 years isn't shit. People on reddit were treating ark as a replacer for investing in SPY which was the issue. Cathie isn't a Peter Lynch or Warren Buffett and hyper growth stocks don't have fundamentals to be bullish all the time and give u strong year over year performance in the long term. The ppl sitting on the sidelines on arkk didn't comment back then or dip in cause their tesla bears. 

I'm not hating on her tho she does have a good product but it's like a replacement of investing in hyper growth stocks in lieu of u picking them urselfs. The quality of her holdings are quite good but if ur entire portfolio is ark ur extremely hyper bullish on growth frankly which carries a lot of risk."
2021-04-21 21:15:26,stocks,"How can it not be if thats her strategy? If you invest in 5 years and things come true, do you just give up and close the doors? Lmao, come on guy, critical thinking."
2021-04-21 23:27:23,stocks,"C'mon now, if you're going to judge individual stocks I don't think Tesla is the one you want to use as your example. 

Since October 2014 (fund inception) ARKK has a 505% return versus 105% S&P500. That's over 6 years of data. 

This is why people need to assume 5+ years of investing with ARK before they get their panties in a twist."
2021-04-21 21:23:32,stocks,"I know, im holding a few of her funds. The only thing ive sold is ARKG due to needing capital for BIGZ. I went ahead and bought CDXS directly since i think that is a secret gem she holds."
2021-04-22 08:34:10,stocks,Classic.
2021-04-22 01:59:59,stocks,"The best part is that she's openly said this, too. She said in an interview, ""we invest with a venture capital mindset.""

ARK can have a place in a portfolio, but it needs to be treated like the place a VC would have in a portfolio. High risk, speculative, small % of a portfolio.

The argument that ""she got lucky with Tesla"" doesn't stick because that's literally her job. Throw stuff at a wall and see what sticks. Tesla stuck. Good. Whatever she's buying up now be that $COIN or $PLTR or whatever might stick too. I hope for everybody who holds $ARKK and related funds that it does stick. That's her job to find those. That's literally venture capital. Invest in high growth, speculative companies that could be the next big thing (a la Tesla) or flop and be dropped from the fund after too long.

This is literally how VC works. The manager sees promise, invests, and prays. PEople need to get that about this fund. It's not magic. Wood has even said that she's trying to bring VC-style investing to retail investors through her funds."
2021-04-21 23:57:44,stocks,"Yeah, I don't know what people in this thread are saying, she has a requirement that she sees at least 15% growth yoy for all her picks. She definitely analyzes the shit out of these companies, as does her team."

2021-04-22 06:19:39,stocks,Because this is a game of Russian roulette and every year would litterally need to represent a new all time high that never correct or else it can’t be a continual 5 year loop .... if that’s the case all stocks she ever owns would need to always be on the the way up because TECHNICALLY the “5 years” is happening everyday for someone .... so if her fund ever looses even one penny of its value it’ll must be that someone who has held for 5 years is loosing value.
2021-04-22 06:16:19,stocks,... I know why I used Tesla as an example ... obviously it’s a great example of what 5 years CAN do but the reality is cathie doesn’t have some magic that allows her to always see purchase a stock 5 years before an explosion.... also what’s the logic on 5 years ? Is it 5 years from the first share of a new company ? Or from the time they buy the last share ?
2021-04-21 20:51:08,stocks,how is taking advice from someone on reddit any better? At least with YouTube you can look at their track record. On reddit it's just random people with 10k in their account providing DD like they're some investing god.
2021-04-22 15:43:29,stocks,"There are tons of YouTube videos out there with Warren Buffet in the thumbnail, too. That in and of itself doesn't mean much."
2021-04-22 04:29:03,stocks,"Well explained. It's a great fund and product to track but ppl shouldnt put money in here thinking 'its diversified so I'm safe' , or 'im just Investing in tech' or 'well it out performed the S&P and Berkshire so I'll DCA this instead of those'. 

She's literally gambling with ur money and her holdings are pretty solid to look at if u want some hyper growth picks. But just like every other managed fund she's selling it to retail. Her recent space ETF is hilarious cause it seems like a  hedge so she can keep the ARK name relevant in case the market falls out of favor with growth stocks, yet she is marketting it as a 'innovative space etf' since it has a lot of conservative picks."
2021-04-22 08:57:08,stocks,Yup.  But when it blows up won’t be pretty.  What is is 95-99% of vc’s lose money.  That’s why she is gaining a lot of praise because it’s so rare to see most of her picks hitting.  Can she keep it up is the biggest question lol
2021-04-21 22:38:47,stocks,"Crypto is at ATH. Yes bitcoin has had some massive crashes. 50+% But look at it right now. 

Markets only go up (long term) and that's basically a fundamental law. If you dont plan on pulling your money in the next two years I don't see the problem."
2021-04-21 22:58:41,stocks,"Nope, I'm just a retail bagholder.

I got downvoted cause I guess the truth hurts. Her stocks are trendy.

Remember trends come and go..."
2021-04-21 22:49:21,stocks,"Look at the long term returns of ARKK vs VOO... It hasn't served you better. Only over a few months, I suppose. But that's not how you assess an investment. A trade, yes. 

Stop penny pinching on the fees and look at the bigger picture. The outsize returns more than make up for the difference in fees, as does the research and managing the ETF that goes into it. Think like an investor 

Imagine being so thick you look at returns over a few months to determine how good an ETF is. And after buying at the highs, which is entirely your problem 🤦‍♂️"

Is a tiny part of my portfolio but it's also set it and forget it. You're paying for them to actively manage (in an ETF wrapper) so in reality it should be easier to buy and hold. 

One thing I think you're missing is growth isn't linear, especially with the type of businesses she's investing in. It's one reason the funds are so volatile and only emphasizes a 5+ year hold. 

My main point to drive home is this is not a fund you invest in if you want to see immediate results. I know that many newbie retail investors want to jump on the bandwagon and expect unreasonable returns because it's ARK. Unfortunately it's turned into a meme which doesn't help matters. End of the day though we're all big boys and girls and need to be responsible for what we do with our money."
2021-04-22 03:20:59,stocks,"> how is taking advice from someone on reddit any better?

I didn't claim it was. There is still value on YouTube, it isn't *all* shite. 

InTheMoney is good, KamikazeCash is good, InvestingClub is good in my books for 3 examples.

Oh, and if there are channels that one was convinced were paid pump/dumpers one could always use whatever they're promoting as a potential (delayed) bearish signal. So even bad advice can have value, you know?

There is a total plague of people on YT just following ARK picks and slapping Cathy Woods on their thumbnail and calling it a day."

2021-04-22 15:21:14,stocks,Yes I get that but the point is that that’s not really a selling point for cathie .... her and EVERYTHING that is still trading on the market in 5 years will be increased from their current prices even if their value plummets ..... this is thanks to inflation not her stock picking prowess.

She is selling a product just like any other actively managed fund. She has her place but it isn't the type of fund you would invest all ur money for 20 years and expect great year over year returns.

I have made plenty of stupid moves but enough smart ones to overcome them.  I don't follow the rules.  Diversity has never been my strong suit.  I invest in sectors and tend to way overweight one or two.  Right now that is drugs which make up 1/3 of my portfolio.  

I like to buy 20-25% below the 52 week high with that price as my target.  I also want a 3-4% dividend while I wait for price appreciation.

I love bad news.  When Drumpf was 1st elected, I used to buy whatever company he went to war with.  It was good for a 15-20% pop after it sunk due to his negative comments.

I like earnings disappointments.  You know when a company announces a 23% increase in sales but the experts were prognosticating a 34% increase and the stock drops $3 a share.  That to me is a buying opportunity.  Or when American Widget announces it is buying American Buggy Whip for $33B and the stock drops $7 a share.

So I'm sure I'm not the only one who has been hearing about this supposedly new SEC rule which basically doesn't allow you to short unless you got collateral on hand. I was pretty excited about this for OTC, fintwit is too and so is ihub and ST about this rule cos I know we get laughed at when we say ""mm manipulation"" but doesn't take a genius to see whats going on recently.

Apparently this April 22 sec rule doesn't apply to OTC? Cos OTC shares are not shorted by borrowing but synthetic shares are used to short aka naked shorting

The SEC article doesn't state that their new rule only applies to those who short by borrowing so I'm not too sure? You mean to tell me naked shorting is allowed?"

I bought some calls for $10 strike for $2 contract when the price was $12 earlier, so the contract was already at the break even. I was even able to do this for a July date. 

This is also a SPAC so NAV is $10 (actually $10.15 on this one as they overfunded). The price went up but generally the calls are still near break even ($13 stock price and $3 contract). This seems like a ridiculously good deal to me but clearly people are selling contracts at this price so I’m sure I don’t fully understand this situation."

Not a fan of Ally Invest browser version, not sure about the app. Clunky browser interface, no fractional shares. Acorns has a small monthly fee which is a bummer, but it looks very user-friendly.

I guess only fans of WWTA are buying it.  That's not how the world works. Or at least, I don't buy repeat copies of a children's book I'm a fan of unless it's to give to people who are not fans. 

Now if your argument is children are ignorant of the adult world, fine. Or that you think adult fans can separate the art from the artist, fine. But dismissing it all as ""Twitter drama"" is more reflective of your beliefs rather than based in fact. A large number have no interest in giving her more money and presumably as fans they already have the books so they aren't the ones buying.

2021-04-22 16:24:58,stocks,"One of my big takeaways from Peter Lynch's book was that as retail investors we really, really need to be flexible. 

I too started off with only growth stocks just like everyone else in their 20s. But during this recent consolidation period for old economy stocks I've spent lots of time and effort to learn about these industries, research contrarian views, and take a good look at the balance sheets of 'old man' companies. It's amazing how there are so many undervalued turnaround stories in these old industries. I've started building these positions as things consolidate for these old industry stocks, right before the deluge of Q1 earnings. 

COVID forced the whole economy to restructure aggressively and companies that didn't were left for dead. Certain 'Old Man' stocks that have been lumbering along for decades have cut off all the fat and their earnings are sprinting forward at tech stock-level momentum. The best thing is that they're profitable and you don't even need to forecast into the future! I believe that the US is emerging out of the crisis, vaccines work, and the economy is roaring back. That being said, there definitely is still a huge space for tech, and some of my favourite tech holdings are related to solar energy and Cathie Wood-style stuff. Pain sucks but it helps us build bulletproof investment strategies as we get more experience."

2021-04-21 20:23:15,stocks,"J.P Morgan and James Dimons most recent letter to shareholders had an interesting statistic. The average investor barely beat inflation with 2,5% returns between 1999 and 2019 whereas stocks made 6,1% annualized and bonds 5%. (I could only find last years numbers for now:)

https://www.financialsamurai.com/annualized-returns-by-asset-class-from-1999-2018/

It’s good to question specific numbers since they highly depend on the period you look at but it remains true that MOST investors don’t beat the market and there Is hardly any evidence of skill with the exception of only a few. 

Even Warren Buffet, Ray Dalio and all Hedgefunds on average didn’t beat the market in the past 15 years.

The main reason professional managers underperform is costs, ignoring costs some studies suggest they are slightly better than the market. 

The following equation must be true:

Average Performance of passive Index = Average Permonace of all active funds - cost difference 

Active funds usually charge 1 - 2% more than Indexfunds which should explain the difference in performance."

I like the current buying opportunities a lot of them are giving and did not want to miss them so this is where I've parked the money.

2021-04-22 16:55:17,stocks,"The biggest hurdle for a giant company like MO to make moves in the cannabis industry is its hard to scale up.   

Intrastate commerce is federally regulated, and marijuana is still federally illegal. 
MO would have to build a factory AND distribution network in every state they wanted to sell their product in, which would make it prohibitively expensive. 

To further complicate the issue, every single legalized state has specifically included legislation requiring all cannabis sold in the state to also be grown in the state.  They tax it on the grow side as well as the retail side, and growing it in state ensures theyre creating jobs for their state.   

  They specifically included this legislation, despite the fact it was already illegal, to ensure they get the most tax revenue and job creation.

 Despite how popular legalization is, the politicians still have critics to appease and face getting kicked out of office if things go sideways. 

Its highly likely it will be federally legal in the next decade, but its highly unlikely intrastate commerce will be allowed."
2021-04-22 03:49:33,stocks,Thanks for your explanations MO is exactly for the same reason (Strong Business with very high dividend and a foot in a growth industry) on my watch list for a while and the current dip is really attracting I'll also take a look on BTI
2021-04-22 03:57:37,stocks,"You're welcome!  MO is a great pick and I added to my position yesterday.  I had bought lower a couple months back, and I could have bought more, so it's not just for the dip in my case.  What I like is that despite this pretty negative news it only dipped about 5-10% then recovered.  That's a strong sign IMO.

MO short to mid-term is a guaranteed dividend with moderate upside.  Potential for big upside long-term.  On the negative side, there's also potential that their ventures into cannabis, etc. don't work out.  It may be a sell in 10 years or so, but we'll still have collected the dividends and probably make it out with a small profit.  I see it as a stock with high potential for reward, low potential for risk.

BTI seems to be growing less aggressively but they're a company that I think will be paying dividends for 30+ years.  Their international exposure assures that, IMO.

Either way, all 3 companies seem to know what they're doing (BTI, PM, MO).  They've had to survive in the face of regulatory pressure for decades, and they've done tremendously."

2021-04-22 00:12:18,stocks,Because they are literally your typical analyst company that just recommends everyone to buy when a stock is green and for you to sell when a stock is red. They just go with market trend and don’t look at a company from a long term fundamental standpoint. If a stock is up 6%-10% in one day they will put a strong buy on it but if the stock is getting beat up than they put a sell or strong sell on it even though its a good company. They are just as shady as any other “analyst” out there.
2021-04-22 13:50:28,stocks,"Actually one of the best things I'm liking so far about them (I'm a trial user, I've been jumping around between a few things) is their transparency. They literally tell you when they buy a stock and when they sell it. There's an 'alert email' that goes out that tells you exactly when they get in and get out.

Their individual investor strategy portfolios also have a detailed record of what they bought and sold and what the profits were.

There is no one forcing you to buy into any of the things they buy into but they do a thorough DD and explanation for all of their moves. They're not always right, but they're seemingly not always wrong either.


Zacks rank is a pretty consistent valuation of a stock too, it doesn't influence my decision to buy into something completely, but it's ways better than someone telling me on reddit, stocktwits why BB earnings will go up for the eighteenth time this month. Definitely neck and shoulders above anything else I've seen out there."

2021-04-21 22:28:16,stocks,"Ideally you want to invest and forget about it.  Mutual funds are good for that.  Using dollar cost averaging you reduce your risk.  For example, invest a set amount each month and you will buy through the highs and lows.  I learned that for individual stocks you need to find good analysis on the the stocks present value.  You want to buy low and sell high.  Avoid analysts who are promoting stocks for companies they represent or TV analysts who also have an agenda.  I use independent analysis from Morningstar.  They use dollar cost averaging which I think is a good measure of a company’s present value.  I review my stocks once a quarter unless there is bad news in the press."
