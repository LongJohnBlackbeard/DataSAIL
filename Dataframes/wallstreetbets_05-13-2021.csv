2021-05-13 19:32:23,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs why I hedge with $556 and $762, if it gets that bad. I could care less about my accounts."
2021-05-13 19:51:27,wallstreetbets,"Over 80% of stocks are owned by the super-rich.  


So when the federal reserve bails out the corporations with massive, unlimited zero and low-interest debt, that's money we're throwing at the super-rich who own these corporations and the boards/ executives who profit massively off their control of those assets, all of whom spend a little bit of it to buy congress.  


So then we create massive inflation to erode away the size of these debts we just issued. After the dust settles, the rich are richer than ever, used all the debt to buy everything, and the size of the debt they bought it all with is half of what is used to be because everything else got inflated."

2021-05-13 19:47:23,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúI understand what there is to know about the economy‚Äù is a phrase never uttered by anyone with the slightest idea about economics. 

Relatedly, ‚Äúbusiness economics‚Äù has everything to do with microeconomics and literally nothing to do with macroeconomics (i.e., ‚Äúthe economy‚Äù)."
2021-05-13 19:54:43,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is the tool of the wealthy to become and stay wealthy. 

No one outside of the absolute titans can have cash, but it's pointless. All fortunes are built on capital debt and holding them long enough for inflation to make them an investment. Rich people have debt on appreciating assets, poor people have debt on depreciating assets. Inflation drives poor people even lower. 

Living paycheck to paycheck because you have two investment homes and a piece of land will get you somewhere living paycheck to paycheck with rent, cars, and other bullshit will keep you poor.

tl;dr version- inflation keeps rich people rich by outpacing the interest on their capital asset debt."
2021-05-13 19:44:03,wallstreetbets,Inflation is fake it‚Äôs a control mechanism
2021-05-13 19:31:35,wallstreetbets,Did Q send you?
2021-05-13 19:43:20,wallstreetbets,Why would they risk controlling the world with their own money vice using the governments/ taxpayers money.
2021-05-13 19:50:41,wallstreetbets,"Its all one big charade. Of course they could control inflation. Problem. Reaction. Solution. In that order, works everytime."

2021-05-13 19:37:44,wallstreetbets,Illuminati confirmed.....
2021-05-13 19:49:06,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not about being poor, it‚Äôs about ‚Äúhow you have to live‚Äù. Right now feeding my family of 4 cost more than my house payment. Say I move to Arkansas and homestead and live off the land and become self sufficient , the local economy does not effect me. So I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more about location and how you choose ( wants vs needs)  to live but yes I‚Äôm sure there are numerous reasons. Right now I bet Bill Gates is losing sleep on how he can get to that tiny protected island off the coast of Australia that‚Äôs only inhabited by its indigenous people so he can shoot them up with gene therapy."
2021-05-13 19:33:49,wallstreetbets,"I see inflation as a way to pay for expense.  Say you had to pay employees more, or more expense of doing business so you would increase your prices to offset cost of doing business. 

The reason it‚Äôs measured is gauge growth of the economy.  If everything stayed the same then most likely wages/salary would be stagnant."
2021-05-13 19:41:10,wallstreetbets,"Hello, Illuminati? I just saw something on wsb and....THEY KNOW!!1!1!!!one!!1!"
2021-05-13 19:31:43,wallstreetbets,"China did have a one child policy for many years. This causes dramas itself after many years of this. But, the world is massively overpopulated.

2021-05-13 19:30:19,wallstreetbets,10% off discounts (Drake meme)
2021-05-13 19:15:19,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs definitely starting to look like they‚Äôre all hitting an all time low. I think we all should be using SNDL as the reference point since it‚Äôs not like it can go to 0.00. It can only go so much more down. But I‚Äôve been buying into the weed sector for a little bit now regardless of the price every week. 5 years from now I‚Äôll be sitting happy on some profits
2021-05-13 19:18:53,wallstreetbets,This analyst said that SNDL from $0.70 will be $4 or $6 this year https://www.influencive.com/why-is-sundial-growers-inc-a-good-buy/ I think that TLRY is going to multiple on percentage a lot too
2021-05-13 19:21:28,wallstreetbets,"Yes, SNDL and TLRY move a lot money, for example SNDL right now is the weed company on the world with the most cash on hand, and TLRY is the one that sells more weed"
2021-05-13 19:41:27,wallstreetbets,"Definitely not SNDL, at least for a while. Some retard some time ago gave the bright idea of google mapping a company and their facilities to see how their operations look. Very solid dd to my surprise. 

I tried this with SNDL and they have two offices (one in Calgary, Canada and another someplace else in Canada) and a farm in Olds, Canada( little cool looking town). The first time I checked, their farm appeared to be quite small. Although, recently there have been more semi truck looking structures set in rows of each other. I‚Äôm guessing for differently yields. 

They are very small and it seems they only stay in Canada unless someone here can prove me wrong. I‚Äôd say give them a lot more time, like opening a few more farms time. The price of their stock is definitely appealing though."
2021-05-13 19:18:28,wallstreetbets,I think tobacco companies would have purchased into the sector if they were already interested by now. Tobacco companies aren‚Äôt going to be popular with these newer generations buying into safer alternatives
2021-05-13 19:23:09,wallstreetbets,$19
2021-05-13 19:28:41,wallstreetbets,maybe $17 dollars and some change
2021-05-13 19:23:40,wallstreetbets,SNDL still pretty far from all time low. I believe it was 12 cents at one point
2021-05-13 19:43:29,wallstreetbets,Why buy weed from a company at high prices when you can just grow your own?
2021-05-13 19:21:17,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve read this one. It‚Äôs hard finding an article that doesn‚Äôt hate SNDL lol. A lot of short interest in this company and I‚Äôm starting to see a lot more hate considering they‚Äôre probably worried about the 1 billion they have in their back pocket. Long story short, I‚Äôd be in with the company thats least expensive with more share count for better profits."
2021-05-13 19:27:52,wallstreetbets,"Do they have more cash than the aforementioned established tobacco behemoths?  All those two companies need to do is acquire some weed.  They have equipment to make it work, distribution, marketing, name recognition,  as I said well established.  I'd be surprised if they didn't make a move should this bill pass."
2021-05-13 19:31:45,wallstreetbets,But right now SNDL has almost the same money on cash than their market capital. SNDL used to be bullshit in 2020ü§£
2021-05-13 19:28:00,wallstreetbets,"I meant in reference to right now. It‚Äôs not going that low again. Way too many holders. If anything, the next pop off will be organic and not some stupid ‚Äúsell at 4.20‚Äù crash"
2021-05-13 19:46:49,wallstreetbets,The average consumer isn‚Äôt lining up at Home Depot to start growing weed and everyone is tired of waiting at a McDonald‚Äôs parking lot for over 30 mins to buy weed from this guy who your friend knows who actually has no idea who they are anymore. It‚Äôs a new world man. That‚Äôs like saying ppl should start growing tobacco
2021-05-13 19:31:22,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. Yeah I don‚Äôt see it going down too much further. I‚Äôd say this news could be a catalyst for tomorrow ü§û
2021-05-13 19:48:19,wallstreetbets,"Bro honestly, I don‚Äôt mind these prices. Idc that it keeps going lower and lower because I know eventually these prices will never exist. These moves we make today are the same moves rich and wealthy people did many many years ago. They bought and they held and then rug pulled when they made enough."
2021-05-13 19:23:20,wallstreetbets,"Carnival now has 22bn in debt ( it was about 9 bn pre-pandemic). In April 2020, they had to raise 4bn at 11.5%, this year they raised at still high 5.75% 

Even considering that average interest rate on the whole 22bn debt is about 4.5 -5%, that will be at least 1 bn in interest payments every year, without even paying the principal in Debt.

This company in a normal year of 2019, had net income of about 3bn. 

From now on they will have to spend 1bn only in interest, and somehow also keep aside money to pay down debt.
Beside they were also doing some equity offering this time in addition to debt, diluting shareholders. And now we may face rising interest rate environment.

I Can't see it reaching its old high anytime soon!! (Unless it gets memed)"

2021-05-13 16:24:24,wallstreetbets,"I mean, Tesla was a very wild ride. When I looked into Tesla it was sitting at 180‚Ç¨ and then catapulted up to 800‚Ç¨. That alone was a huuuuuuge jump. Everyone was yelling sell, but that crazy stock continued to rise. Earlier this month it was sitting at 600‚Ç¨, that's like 3k in before split price. Just think about that... Some people called it overvalued at 180‚Ç¨ and it jumps up to 800‚Ç¨ and then continues all the way up to about 4000‚Ç¨. Has there been another stock with movements similar to this one?"

Quality control issues, production numbers, and labor issues are also all against Tesla where their early penetration of the EV market is not going to hold against big auto makers in the longterm.

Test drive a Model Y and then a Mustang Mach-E if you really think Tesla has any unique selling point in the EV market. If you're looking at EV shipping/trucking, the Amazon fleet powered by Rivian and that company's expansion might be a better bet. If you aren't accredited to invest in Rivian, you can still invest in a company that has a stake in them."

They've been cranking out hybrids for like two decades now and they've been experimenting with EVs on a non-commercial level for decades. Plus, all their ICE factories can be converted to EV production far more quickly (and at lower cost) than Tesla can build new gigafactories.

Now down 30% from that beautiful ATH and I have no idea what happened. It's only been 2 months but it feels like 2 years. Sometimes it feels like someone else is playing my account and I'm just watching from the sidelines. 

I looked at a screenshot from that day and all I can think is ""what the actual fuck...!"" like...why wouldn't you sell? The numbers were astronomical. 100 baggers, 50 baggers, 2x, 3x, 4x...it was all there. Now a lot of it is gone. Shit I was down a bit on that had 30, 60, 90+ days left have all withered...-98%...

2021-05-13 19:46:18,wallstreetbets,"Arguably, possibly more. They need to buy in whole shares, meaning that need to match your fractional share up with others that make one whole share. So, it's possible a fractional share may see a higher demand, if only because you 'complete the puzzle' that let's them close one of their short shares.

Or, that fractional share just is part of one of the 73.5 million shares they don't need to buy, to get it back to the legal amount of shares. Either, or.

Actually, here's a thought: open up 73.5 million accounts, buy one unique fraction of a share in each account, smallest fraction they'll let you buy. Never sell any of those shares. Infinite squeeze now guaranteed."

2021-05-13 15:14:35,wallstreetbets,Jack Ma needs papabear Xi to carry him. Whether or not Chinese stocks will win depends on whether or not papabear Xi wants to carry them to the galaxy
2021-05-13 15:58:54,wallstreetbets,Exactly
2021-05-13 16:04:24,wallstreetbets,They are only red because of the fine they got by government AFAIK. Earnings were lit
2021-05-13 15:16:36,wallstreetbets,Standard deviation channnel
2021-05-13 16:26:51,wallstreetbets,Me too. First time leveraged long. But man alive! I thought I bought the dip. I didn't know the dip was this filthy. The earnings weren't actually negative apart from 2.8 billion fine. 2.8?!?!

2021-05-13 15:21:37,wallstreetbets,RIP Wade Boggs‚Ä¶and Boss Hog
2021-05-13 15:43:47,wallstreetbets,"My opinion is good swing , long term is better but should hold 195-200 level under that level pushes down more and baba is big company as long as Chinese government doesn‚Äôt break it down"
2021-05-13 17:34:04,wallstreetbets,Huge resistance at 200 I saw. I'm tapped out on cash buying the dip unfortunately
2021-05-13 15:01:09,wallstreetbets,"I was up to $86K in Feb. Now down to under $60K. I sold all of my GME and AMC for a small profit to get out of that rollercoaster...put it all in the mega-cap stocks and guess what, they tanked the next day. Bought a ton of bumble before earnings, they blow it out, now the stock is at an all-time low. I figured the SPY would have to come back down tomorrow and next week so I bought puts for May 21....whelp, looks like the SPY is going to keep going up today. AMC - I should have just bought more, instead I bought puts for tomorrow thinking it HAS to come down....boom, shoots up another 16%. 

&#x200B;

Feel free to use my trades as strategy - just do the exact opposite and you will be rich."
2021-05-13 15:06:01,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not the onlyone that has a red devils portfolio üòú
2021-05-13 15:32:23,wallstreetbets,just right amount of tardation is what i see
2021-05-13 16:16:48,wallstreetbets,Yes.
2021-05-13 15:18:06,wallstreetbets,Probably both
2021-05-13 15:21:33,wallstreetbets,"objectively speaking: you are a dumb degenerate
but try finding a sane person on this subreddit..."
2021-05-13 15:28:05,wallstreetbets,"You will just need to hang in there a few months, market is shit"
2021-05-13 15:51:15,wallstreetbets,"Earnings season. Sit it out next year. 

Just because someone beats earnings doesn‚Äôt mean the stock will go up (even if it should)

This is why even some pros like to pull a lot of their money out for this month."
2021-05-13 19:06:02,wallstreetbets,I ask myself this all the time. Am I being a big enough retard?
2021-05-13 19:54:23,wallstreetbets,damn well u r definitely DI-VER-SI-FIED
2021-05-13 15:01:52,wallstreetbets,this is why your average retail investor loses. you dont even know what you're doing just opening random positions and shit.
2021-05-13 15:15:27,wallstreetbets,If you have a put on AMC then you are retarded.
2021-05-13 15:17:29,wallstreetbets,Where's your PSLV?
2021-05-13 15:29:53,wallstreetbets,Can you please post your upcoming weekly moves on Sundays?
2021-05-13 16:14:53,wallstreetbets,You're not the only one with amc puts for tomorrow. Good thing I own enough shares to offset the loss.
2021-05-13 19:30:51,wallstreetbets,Simulation theory is real.  The algos live inside your brain and know where your stops are
2021-05-13 15:23:14,wallstreetbets,Agreed. The more money I see retards making the dumber and more of a degenerate I have become.
2021-05-13 15:54:00,wallstreetbets,"Shit man, that's whats happening. I pulled out and went all cash before April, then I saw the dips and put alllll of my money back in the market.....and the dips kept coming /crying"
2021-05-13 15:14:00,wallstreetbets,Says someone with nickname like yours. OMFG.
2021-05-13 15:08:47,wallstreetbets,"Explain to me then, how do I not know what I am doing when I owned all of these positions before earnings, which most of them blew out? I definitely shit the bed on options but I don't see how these positions are random and unwarranted..."
2021-05-13 15:17:12,wallstreetbets,That's a given. I thought being retarded was a good thing though...? Just bought the put today thinking it will get sold a ton on the gains and tank tomorrow.
2021-05-13 18:39:35,wallstreetbets,I had a strong urge to buy UCO (2x Crude Oil) and FB leap calls. So puts on both should earn you a quick buck. I don't have enough money to lose to make weekly moves anymore.
2021-05-13 16:18:09,wallstreetbets,"Feels good to know that. I was diamond hands from January until late March and got out at $11.7. I know how that rollercoaster can go....but I also know it can just keep exploding from pure retardness....I mean, the stock just went up 30% after missing earnings lmao"
2021-05-13 15:15:47,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôre not random or unwarranted, I think you have a lot of good positions there, the market is just fucked right now"
2021-05-13 15:17:47,wallstreetbets,One difference is a professional has an overall strategy for their whole portfolio. Think gambling. Right now you are betting the Yankees to win or lose next week while pro gamblers bet win totals months out and bet off units. You are playing the game to lose in the long run but feel good in the short run until it's all gone. Need overall strategy and management. Not oh the Yankees are hot tonight
2021-05-13 15:36:13,wallstreetbets,Get sell your put and buy amc. This thing hasn‚Äôt even left that station yet.
2021-05-13 15:22:27,wallstreetbets,"Good point. I definitely am ""chasing the money"" right now and have moved to a more short term strategy. Seems like it could've worked out with all the volatility in the market. It's like I picked the Yankees to beat the Tigers and then they get blown out 12-0."
2021-05-13 15:48:40,wallstreetbets,I'll do you a solid and hold my put...if I buy AMC it will tank
2021-05-13 16:20:00,wallstreetbets,"Keep your put, annnnnd buy shares, you win by losing"

Either way, future is looking good."
2021-05-13 17:42:35,wallstreetbets,"there's no spirit in going all in, just yolo if you really really believe in a company and never do it during hype moment

but i would say pltr trend shows why going yolo mode is a bad idea, you don't have enough cash compared to your initial investment to average down

don't sell, buy if you can

good luck retard"

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

2021-05-13 16:06:58,wallstreetbets,"What's to speculate though? You can go on the DD subs and see gamestop flat out saying they'll see reddit on the moon.

You have a 9:1 buy sell ratio with 8M volume 

You see 2 trades being sent off exchange for every 1 executed publicly. 

Everything is speculation.

Do none of you invest anything? It's ALLLLLLLLL speculation.

When you say ""I think AAPL is gonna do great this earrings as sales should be up because the public is buying their products a ton. I'm gonna buy calls and shares!""

Well, wouldn't you know it? You were completely right but the stock fell anyway and you lost. Oh well! 

You know why this is? It's because MM Citadel and HF Citadel are the same. They control the market, literally deciding how to make it while also betting against every trade was they have 40% of all retail trades executed.

You know why the house always wins in poker? They control the dealer, the games and if you're too good or win too much they can just ban you. 

Would you play a poker game of the player was also the dealer and also owned the house? They got too decide exactly what cards are gonna come? When they cheat there is no impartial house, no prison or arrest. 

When the flop does come they can tell you it's A K K and with your AA you have a full house! YES!! 

Then two weeks later they tell you ""actually it was a 777 flop and they had pocket 7s you lose!""

Wait but there are only 4 sevens in the deck they cheated! 

Oh did they? They won a billion so we will fine then $10,000. That's fair right?

Haha"

2021-05-13 16:15:20,wallstreetbets,"I think your understanding of poker is a bit off. You always play poker against the person who owns the house, and is the dealer. Whether that's a home game with your buddies, or in a casino, it doesn't matter.

In a casino however, the house has no incentive to ""cheat"" as you say, by controlling the dealer or determining when cards come out. They always rake about 10% of every pot. So if you do very well and win a lot, they don't care, they're still making the same amount of money off of you, or whoever wins the next hand.

Bad analogy."

No 1+1=2"
2021-05-13 16:23:44,wallstreetbets,"No, you don‚Äôt understand poker. You said if you‚Äôre too good they kick you out. Why would they kick you out if you‚Äôre only winning other players money and not the house? The house just takes the rake and they make money regardless. The house is indifferent to your skill level when you don‚Äôt play against the house."
2021-05-13 16:21:02,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, ""against"" was the wrong word, I meant ""with"" because you said 

>Would you play a poker game of the player was also the dealer and also owned the house?

You're always playing poker where the house is the dealer. Either it's your buddy, or it's the casino."
2021-05-13 16:20:49,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre the one who said first it was ONLY UP THERE TO BEGIN WITH BECAUSE THEY OVER SHORTED IT. Sounds a lot like 1 + = 2. And I guess by ‚Äòto begin with‚Äô you mean back before it was ‚Äòup‚Äô, in other words...down. Which I agree with"
2021-05-13 16:26:44,wallstreetbets,"Correct the house can decide if you're too good and if they loose too much they can kick you out.

If you count cards in blackjack that is a SKILL and using that SKILL will get you banned.

When we won...they closed off buying to retail thus ""banning them"" from the game. There are many games in a casino.

The dealer in poker is the brokerage stupid, the house is the US government.

They are both a player and market maker.

What

The

Fuck

Don't

You

?
?
?"
2021-05-13 16:24:01,wallstreetbets,"Correct...the house is a DEALER and not a PLAYER. 

In the market the dealer is also the player and they also own the house. 

So the dealer...gets to decide which cards come and they do so to benefit themselves...as they play against you.

If they cheat and you call over the house to enforce the rules they rule in the favor of themselves.

Not sure what you're not grasping here. 

The dealer... literally gets to go through the deck and pick the cards to help themselves.

They KNOW what you have... because they look at your cards as they deal them to you...

So they know YOUR hand but you do not know THERE hand. 

My Lord hahahah"
2021-05-13 16:24:51,wallstreetbets,"Correct. It only squeezed because it was over shorted.

They don't over short, it doesn't squeeze no matter how much they try. Lmao

Jesus reddit wtf is up with you today? How does no one understand anything? Haha"
2021-05-13 16:36:14,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm gonna stop you at your first line... ‚Äòif they lose (not loose) too much they can kick you out‚Äô

You don‚Äôt play against the house in poker, it is impossible for the house to lose money. There is no benefit to kicking people out who win, because the money they win is from other players. You clearly don‚Äôt understand how to poker works while also ridiculing other people because you don‚Äôt think they know how poker works. 

I get the feeling you do the same shit with stock picks. You wander around aimlessly while making fun of everyone else for being lost. Also, you should consider a name change, unless you‚Äôre going for ironic, then you should stick with it."
2021-05-13 16:26:02,wallstreetbets,"Because that's not how poker works, so it's a piss poor analogy. They never go through the cards, ever. Never, ever, ever."
2021-05-13 16:29:16,wallstreetbets,"No, remember it squeezed because of the overshooting AND WSB. The 1 + 1 = 2. It‚Äôs hard to follow you when you‚Äôre so all over the place."
2021-05-13 16:46:27,wallstreetbets,"Correct. If you beat the house in games against the house they kick you out and ban you. 

We were NOT playing against the house in GME and the dealer kicked us out for winning too much because we were beating the other players at the table who was also the dealer and the house laughed.

In poker you play the players, not the dealers or the house. The dealer does not know your hand. The house does not know your hand. The dealer deals IMPARTIALLY and the house enforces the rules. 

The ""rake"" is your tax dollars. 

You pay the house money to enforce the rules fairly. 

Instead, the dealer is actually Citadel the player and the house allows it because ""we can't afford dealers, games should run themselves. We just watch and enforce the rules""

The dealer sees your hands as they deal them to you.

They know you have AA and thus when they deal the flop instead of it being random they shuffle through the deck and deal the cards that hurt you hand and make them the winner.

When you can the floor to say ""hey they're cheating"" the SEC(HOUSE) laughs at you. ""You're playing against professionals what did you think would happen?""

Um...that the brokers were impartial and market makers weren't able to rig the market in favor of their bets against mine?!?

The SEC laughs again and says ""but they pay us all this money to rule in their favor, we aren't supposed to take that money?"""
2021-05-13 16:30:51,wallstreetbets,"Correct that's how a CASINO works and there are many games in the casino. Just like many trades and different bets you can make in the market. 

Hurr durr

Today you learned."
2021-05-13 16:30:22,wallstreetbets,"Correct. 

1 cannot be 2 unless there is another 1 first.

The first 1 is the determining factor. 

Without the first 1 the second 1 cannot make 2.

Today you learned math"
2021-05-13 16:55:05,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúYou know why the house always wins in poker? They control the dealer, the games and if you‚Äôre too good or win too much they can just ban you.‚Äù You can understand how that makes it sound like you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about right? That‚Äôs what started this whole ordeal. I understand what you‚Äôre trying to say, but your execution is shit."
2021-05-13 16:34:34,wallstreetbets,"No, they have no idea which cards are coming up. As I said, they rake 10% of every pot, so they have no incentive to stack the deck. They make the same either way."
2021-05-13 16:59:58,wallstreetbets,"You right man, I should've said Casino. 

Poker is a fair and impartial game of skill...like trading SHOULD be. 

It does not act like that however does it? 

The system is NOT impartial and fair, is it?"
2021-05-13 16:36:53,wallstreetbets,"They literally do have every idea which cards come up...they are the dealer(market maker) and thus control the cards. They literally look at your hand as you are dealt them. You out your trade through them, they see it and bet against it. 

You do not know their hand, they do know yours.

They literally control the market and make it in their favor...that's their job. Literally they make the market and thus are called market makers. 

Hahaha I'm really not sure why this is so hard for you to grasp.

When they get caught stealing and cheating the house does nothing."
2021-05-13 17:01:47,wallstreetbets,Yes I agree. But if you replace it with casino it still doesn‚Äôt make sense. If you replace poker with blackjack then it would make sense
2021-05-13 16:38:19,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha, you're a dip shit. It's my mistake, I should've realized sooner."
2021-05-13 17:07:25,wallstreetbets,"There are many games in a casino like there are in the stock market.

The market is a casino like the casino is a casino.

The fairest game in a casino is poker...

Blackjack is clear that the game is designed in favor of the house without any need to cheat or steal. If you beat them, they will ban you.

So you decide to play poker because you're not playing against the house in a game where luck rules 51/49.

In poker the dealer is supposed to be fair and impartial. The house enforces the rules. 

When you pick a stock to buy you're sitting down at a poker table and the hand dealt is the stock you bought. 

The dealer dealt you that hand and looked at it before because you literally paid the dealer for it and thus to execute your order and deal the cards they obviously know what hand you want. 

Now the dealer(market maker) Citadel also know what the PLAYER(hedge fund) Citadel cards are and when it's time to deal the flop shuffle through the cards and place down the ones that make Citadel the player win. 

When you say 'hey the dealer and player are working together and cheating"" the house(us government) laughs at you."
2021-05-13 16:41:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm a dipshit because you don't know citadel controls 40% of all retail trades?

Um...why do you think 1.7m shares are traded through dark pools like FINRA ADF and only 800k go through public exchanges like NYSE? 

They are short GME and by routing buy orders through FINRA ADF instead of NYSE they remove the buying pressure. 

They are short GME and by routing sell orders through NYSE instead of FINRA ADF they increase sell pressure. 

It is baffling to me how none of you grasp this after all this time.

When you won in January they kicked you out of the casino.

There was no impartial house or dealer. Hahaha"
2021-05-13 17:18:35,wallstreetbets,"Jesus dude, I understand what you‚Äôre trying to say. I have understood what your are trying to say the entire time. I‚Äôve just been trying to point out to you are contradicting yourself and the casino metaphors are just making things more confusing. 

Please explain to me how this makes any sense: ‚Äòthe market is a casino like the casino is a casino‚Äô. 

For something like this to make sense it has to be A is a B like C is a B. ‚ÄòHonda is a car like Toyota is a car‚Äô and the reference point is a car that Honda and Toyota both have in common. Your are saying Honda is a car like a car is a car. Which is just saying a Honda is a car but in a more confusing way."
2021-05-13 16:44:18,wallstreetbets,"I never said shit about the market, I wasn't talking about the market at all. I said your analogy of the market doesn't work because that's not how poker works in casinos or home games."
2021-05-13 18:21:52,wallstreetbets,"You understand but please explain more because you don't understand? 

The market... Is a casino... Like the Casino is a casino....

What doesn't make sense? The function the same only a casino is more fair and the house is impartial in games against other players.. Like poker.

The rake... Is the fees you pay to the broker and the taxes to the government.

How else can I make this any clearer for you?

Do you know why people say you can't beat SPY? Why passive investing in indexes is the norm because it's ""so hard to beat the market?""

Because the market is fucking rigged. Hahaha

You are better off learning to play texas hold em and will have a much greater chance of becoming a millionaire beating that game than you do in the market....because the market is fucking rigged."
2021-05-13 16:50:36,wallstreetbets,"It's an analogy between the casino market and the casino casino.

You would not play in a CASINO that operated the way the market did.

You would not play a game in which the dealer was also a player and could look at the hands, shuffle the deck and buy the house to let them cheat and steal. 

""This is a casino ma'am"" and private banks run it all in their favor.

Like a casino everything is designed to take your money from you. ""they always win"" because they are the market makers and the government is bought by them 

Today you learned"
2021-05-13 18:28:02,wallstreetbets,Your metaphors are shit like shit is shit. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm trying to say
2021-05-13 16:56:28,wallstreetbets,I also would not play in a casino that operated the way a gas station does. Piss poor analogy.
2021-05-13 19:44:00,wallstreetbets,"So you understand but don't understand so I need to explain it to you but it's shit? 

Hm...ok? 

Today you learned the market is a rigged casino though, so that's good for you.

You have a much better chance of winning it big in an actual casino than you do the rigged market."
2021-05-13 16:58:59,wallstreetbets,What about the gas station is bad and makes it a casino like the stock market? Hahaha
2021-05-13 19:51:22,wallstreetbets,Wow. Are we even having the same conversation right now?
2021-05-13 19:57:06,wallstreetbets,"We are.

So I clarified. 

Then you said 'uh...well...it's shit and your shit!""

2021-05-13 14:18:08,wallstreetbets,GME didnt start as sticking it to the Hedgefunds it started as a good play. It was called WSB the b stands for bets not bankrupting hedgefunds. That was icing on the top but ultimatly this was all a good bet to make money!
2021-05-13 14:17:10,wallstreetbets,"WSB can't take credit for something when any discussion of that topic immediately gets the poster banned.

I don‚Äôt get why you (and a lot of others on WSB) are so salty towards AMC. Sure AA took a bonus but after a 25% jump today you‚Äôre finally talking about it, even if you‚Äôre shit talking about it. There‚Äôs a squeeze coming. If you don‚Äôt like AA you can stay away from it. At least WSB are talking about it though"

2021-05-13 14:18:06,wallstreetbets,I own some but the post is correct. We are injecting more money in the execs pockets only to see AMC fall again. AMC is playing everyone. Best to sell high and not hold this long term.
2021-05-13 14:17:08,wallstreetbets,This guys seems super legit hahahha
2021-05-13 14:17:20,wallstreetbets,"WSB will become bagholders. There's big money at play, its not some WSB broke  boys pushing this. Someone big bought heavy call options and is pushing this squeeze themselves. This will be a disgusting rug pull at 14."

2021-05-13 14:20:46,wallstreetbets,Yah I was about to comment the same thing. My company had to shut down because of the pandemic (casino) but the big executives still got their bonuses while the small guys got laid off.
2021-05-13 14:21:58,wallstreetbets,"True but those companies earn it when they hit their #s, AMC did not.The purpose of WSB was to undermine the hedge funds and offer an opportunity for the small investor to have access to trading options only the hedge funds offer their larger clientele. But in the case of AMC, they took advantage of WSB. I think it's uncool and not any different than what the big banks did in 2008-10 with TARP funds."
2021-05-13 14:35:11,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre saying that as if the CEO reached out with a post on WSB begging people to support them. It naturally became a meme stock and also was a decent recovery play
2021-05-13 14:46:13,wallstreetbets,"WSB has nothing to do with the rise of AMC anymore, and maybe they were giving bonuses to heavy hitting people within the business so they‚Äôd stay on board. Who knows. Whatever the reason, your argument is theoretical, suspect, weak my friend. Come back with some fact and numbers perhaps?"
2021-05-13 14:39:04,wallstreetbets,"Thing is, it‚Äôs left them in an excellent position in the industry. They‚Äôve gone from nearly going bankrupt to securing more than enough to survive for a year even with no earnings. Vaccine rollout combined with a pile of delayed blockbuster film releases should see them do quite well in the short term. 

Long term, yes management is greedy af and are looking out for themselves. Company is now viable though and at least for a year is safe with what should be some good income to come their way. Depending on publics spending in cinemas could set them up to be a good buyout for someone who wants to own a national cinema chain."
2021-05-13 14:41:42,wallstreetbets,"That's not what I said, the stock performance spoke for itself and the CEO and upper management, who did nothing to help the stock, benefitted from it."
2021-05-13 14:43:02,wallstreetbets,"Also, how was this a decent recovery play when theaters remain either shut down or operating so minimally they are barely covering overhead?"
2021-05-13 14:45:00,wallstreetbets,That's a great answer. Thanks!
2021-05-13 14:43:38,wallstreetbets,They did seek pretty good financing to sustain the pandemic hit from what I remember
2021-05-13 14:44:29,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a good recovery play because demand for people going to the theatre is going to be the highest it‚Äôs been in decades
2021-05-13 14:51:10,wallstreetbets,"Ok, thanks."
2021-05-13 14:48:35,wallstreetbets,"When that happens yeah but when the push to support AMC started, I disagree, especially given the greedy cash grab take by upper management."

2021-05-13 15:57:00,wallstreetbets,"I have a question about AMD. From what I understand, they're being pretty heavily shorted right now to keep the price low ahead of the merger with XLNX. The merger isn't supposed to be complete until the end of the year. Is AMD going to move sideways the rest of the year or do you think the price will start to rise as the merger gets closer? I'm trying to know what to expect."
2021-05-13 15:09:14,wallstreetbets,"I think AMD will get there eventually, but I also think the tech supercycle is coming to an end."
2021-05-13 14:42:33,wallstreetbets,Its not just intel. They're going to eventually cut into nVIDIAs market share. Wouldn't be surprised if AMD announced their entry into the AI market. That would be huge.

2021-05-13 14:11:58,wallstreetbets,"I'm not entirely sure... 

Logic behind the earnings puts is their price being a little inflated assuming good news, them probably not meeting the super high expectations, and the recent trend for tech/media stocks to drop some on earnings.

2021-05-13 13:32:35,wallstreetbets,"The cons to this: you have to pay to borrow and by shorting an inverse as opposed to going long on a regular non-inverse, you lose the ability to write covered calls and collect premium.  The margin requirements to short are higher than just owning non-inverse shares, and your max gain is capped at 100% but your losses could exceed that if the market sloughs off like it tends to do from time to time - going long on non-inverse, loss is 100% max, gains are infinite max.  Also, going short, you can get margin called and you can be forced to cover if the shares you're borrowing need to be returned for any reason.  Going long non-inverse, you don't need to worry about margin calls or anything, and the icing on the cake is that they are marginable securities that count towards the 25k PDT/leverage etc"
2021-05-13 13:32:36,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck would you short an inverse compared to just buying the 3x leveraged opposite?
2021-05-13 16:58:18,wallstreetbets,"there are different nuances between inverse ETFs and leveraged inverse ETFs, from your example I'm guessing you are asking about the leveraged inverse ETFs? Over longer period of time they are subject to the compounding effect

the path that the underlying takes is also as important, if not more important, than the price

for example if today silver is 30 dollars, and I told you that after 250 trading days silver is going to be 50 dollars, there's no way you could accurately tell what the price of a 2 or 3 x leveraged inverse silver ETF will be

if the price of the underlying in the future is the same that the price of the underlying today, you can guarantee that the leverage ETFs (both inverse and regular) will lose money over that period of time

the decay of inverse leveraged ETF is stronger than of the long one

decay is very dependent on the realized volatility

if you are shorting an inverse leveraged etf, you are hoping that the underlying will have a lot of back and forth movement, without going against you in a straight line

you can read the prospectus of these products to see the estimated decay vs realized volatility

&#x200B;

are links allowed? if so you can check page 19 of this offering document  (and every few other pages, as this applies to all the leveraged products)  where the estimated decay is nicely graphed for retards like us

2021-05-13 16:08:30,wallstreetbets,"Made some money on SQQQ, not enough tho"
2021-05-13 13:33:55,wallstreetbets,Bc you hate making money. Only reason I can think off.
2021-05-13 17:02:07,wallstreetbets,"after a short period of time these turn into completely different bets, buying 3x long etf is absolutely not the same as shorting 3x inverse

if you are interested, take a piece of paper (as I had to do), and plot period by period what happens when the underlying moves 10% a day, for this particular example, which is going to be short, lets assume we are trading 2x levered etfs, and our underlying product is moving 10% a day, lets assume on the first day everything is at 100

day one

product 100

2x long 100

2x short 100

&#x200B;

day two

product 110

2x long 120

2x short 80

&#x200B;

day two (10% down)

product 99 (because move is calculated in % of the previous closing), so 10% loss from 110

2x long 96, because it's down 20% of 120

2x short 96 because it will go up 20 of 80

do you see my point?

&#x200B;

so after just 2 periods, your product is almost at breakeven, but both sides of the leveraged etfs decayed

&#x200B;

this doesn't mean that shorting leveraged etfs is free money, because on your short side you can make only 100% (which will never go exactly to zero, another funny math thing there), but can have unlimited loss, so if the underlying is moving in a straight line day after day, your losses will also compound, and can become multiples of the initial bet"
2021-05-13 14:11:38,wallstreetbets,"Because the 3x leveraged bull fund still decays, it requires repeated big green days to climb. He'd be better off buying the non-leveraged and selling covered calls and such."
2021-05-13 13:38:09,wallstreetbets,Numb nuts.... if the inverse always goes down... the 3x leveraged opposite always goes up.... duhhhhhh üòÜ

2021-05-13 14:14:53,wallstreetbets,Upro?
2021-05-13 14:26:56,wallstreetbets,No. Just look at the massive draw down on TQQQ last year. SQQQ didn't have the same level of movement. Granted TQQQ is triple leverage and SQQQ is merely 2x short but you would still expect some sort of spike when the market dumped 30% in 2 weeks.

2021-05-13 15:33:37,wallstreetbets,In case there was any doubt about the number of wrinkles on my brain... But UPRO seems to track TQQQ fairly closely so I don't see much correlation to SQQQ. I don't really see why shorting a high value ultra short ETF would fail in the long run if you can avoid getting margin called AND if your broker allows you to short ETFs.

2021-05-13 14:29:08,wallstreetbets,"RDFN is pound for pound more efficient at what they do than the competition.  Not that Zillow or Open aren‚Äôt also decent choices.  They sell the homes they list faster and for more money than competition, and the evidence is in their numbers.  I have high hopes for this company as an investment.  With the real estate market expected to grow substantially in 2021, I expect their competitive edge to really let them take an even bigger slice of that market share.  Also helps that their business covers every aspect of the home buying process.  A true one-stop-shop."

Redfin, Opendoor, Zillow, Rkt, UWMC. All have been bleeding like crazy (Rkt was an ape mistake for sure though, not sure if worth averaging down or just taking the big L).

Hoping for a green turnaround soon though."

2021-05-13 13:20:13,wallstreetbets,"lmfao beat me to it

long/short strats are highly focused on the interplay between individual companies

if i think tsla is going to rip into traditional car manu shares, i will not only long tsla but also short a car manu company with poor ev rolllout

this is an amplification and added leverage to my bet, not a hedge. i not only believe that tsla will do well, but that it will do so well that it will eat its competitors stock price in the process

this long-short position ALSO has a hedging component. if the market in general or manufacturing or car manufacturing drops across the board, then my short position will help offset my long in tsla. this is good because i am essentially making a market neutral bet in the first place that tsla eats its competitors value, not that it rises in general alongside the market as a whole

of course the balance between trade amplification and hedge will vary across long/short trades, but it is not in its essence a market neutralizing strategy, even if it tends to be a market hedging one as an added bonus

there are specific market neutral strategies or hedging strategies, long/short isnt it though

ironically, what novice traders shouldnt do is pretend that they are sophisticated like the OP does. what you should do is go with simple gut calls about the future and take positions that professional funds are constrained from doing by their need to stick to rigid formulae and investing rules"

Then, cheaper vix calls (or vixy shares for a safer investment) to protect yourself against a possible market crash. Vix is the volatility index. When stocks go down, vix goes up. So even corrections can make vix profitable. Spy is the long, vix is short term, you should take profit when you can and get back in low if you don't think a market crash is coming. If you think a market crash is coming hold your vix through the crash and exit your long (before the crash) for max profit. The nice part is if You mess up, as long as your spy call is long enough out you can hold for your money back. If you bought into spy the day before covid crash you only would have needed to wait a year to have all funds back. -iv"

is spy/vix a long position in a stock that is expected to appreciate and a short position in a tool that declines 80% of the time?"
2021-05-13 13:15:07,wallstreetbets,"first of all i agree that making a bet on a stock relative to another stock is somewhat easier as overall market direction impact is less

your both example are not a good representation of equity long/short

classic example would be (although falling a bit towards market neutral) long pepsi short coke, or in WSB case long RKT short  UWMC (or vice versa). Here you don't care about overall market direction, sector and other factor exposure, etc. You are just betting that one company stock is going to do better than another company stock, and you want to isolate that bet

the couple of examples you gave is more like how to hedge my market risk without shorting, the textbook joke example of which is buying stocks of Champaign makers and also buying stocks of Funeral home service companies

i can't spend too much time on this, but there must be some misunderstanding between everyone elses take on equity long/short and your understanding (or at least expressing) of equity long short"

I do care about overall market direction. Overall, spy goes up. Overall, vix goes down. These are facts. This means it is still a long/short portfolio. Are you suggesting spy drops are not correlated with vix increases?"

2021-05-13 13:02:06,wallstreetbets,Can you really call it a squeeze? Marketbeat says short interest is less than 21% and days to cover is 0.6 days. Can you even squeeze that? AMC can be bought now as a value play with theatres opening and then not going bankrupt anymore by the share offerings they‚Äôve done.
2021-05-13 12:12:15,wallstreetbets,Yelp. Now more share offerings. The short squeeze is guaranteed!

2021-05-13 12:51:24,wallstreetbets,I believe that $12 is a realistic price that it may reach.  I'm unwilling to comment beyond that.

2021-05-13 14:28:39,wallstreetbets,"My strat is basically buy things I think will be higher in 6-9 months, if it starts to rise and gets to the +30-40% mark I cut the investment in half and hold that in cash until I find another that I think I'll invest in.  If it goes down, I just hold it.  If the 1/2 investment goes up a lot, great, I hold it.  Super basic but I've been doing that for 3 years and turned 5k into 43k (it was almost 50k like 2 weeks ago... but tech has been selling like a B).  But just keep holding.  Continuously selling stocks gets you nowhere.  Keep on diversifying, and sell only when you actually need the money for something (downpayment on house, kids, vacation, etc)  If you are trying to time the market, go for it, but don't be upset when the arrow goes the other way, the short-term market never makes any sense, but long term everything makes sense."

""No generic memes"" and all that"
2021-05-13 14:56:07,wallstreetbets,Yea but the same could be said for GME. That was a company on the verge of collapse. Until it was served up hot. AMC doesn't feel like it has the potential to be that but if you are wrong you loose a little if you are right you stand to gain alot.
2021-05-13 14:03:32,wallstreetbets,Should've listened back in decemeber when a few of us started commenting on it

2021-05-13 12:38:33,wallstreetbets,"That is a reason I guess. The problem I saw was that just because it had a lower barrier of entry, it didn't mean it was good thing to enter. It never had a great bull case, whereas Gamestop had both technicals and a bull case."
2021-05-13 12:46:23,wallstreetbets,Yep. I was able to afford more AMC. I have 17GME and 163AMC.
2021-05-13 13:11:36,wallstreetbets,Strange thing is that even at 1% many brokerages don‚Äôt have GME shares to lend (at least to retail)

2021-05-13 18:25:26,wallstreetbets,Only time I've ever posted on reddit but I think this is some excellent advice and although basic as a new investor it really changed my perspective so thank you for this post
2021-05-13 16:02:37,wallstreetbets,"You think as I do. Sold a bunch at 12 made some money, bought a bottle of whiskey with some of my profits. Ima gonna drink my whiskey and do some drunk trading with the rest because I pretty much can't lose now.

At the end of the day I'm just an ape so I push the green button when I see red numbers and I push the red button when I see green numbers. I don't know what I'm doing but it's good if there's green numbers under P&L, I think?"

2021-05-13 15:27:58,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs what it was on the little squeeze in Jan-feb. amc has been shorted so much harder this time. People who crunched the number have said 4 digits at least
2021-05-13 17:24:19,wallstreetbets,Lol why not 100k?
2021-05-13 17:23:10,wallstreetbets,Lower than you sold for lol
2021-05-13 13:07:24,wallstreetbets,About a month ago it was hovering around $8. If I didn't have to pay my taxes I would have bought a lot more.

2021-05-13 16:18:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah I just double checked. You're right.
2021-05-13 18:11:49,wallstreetbets,"To everyone reading this, you should know that this person joined WSB and started trading 3 months ago, and has done nothing but post about GME and AMC ever since.

He's a generic hopium ""new wave"" WSBer, and you should take his ""price targets"" for what they are: absolute nonsense. I mean, good lord, $100k/share lmao."
2021-05-13 17:29:02,wallstreetbets,How much of the float do you think retail holds? Is it really enough to squeeze shoetl sellers when there's 500million shares?
2021-05-13 18:08:49,wallstreetbets,"100k?

Bruh.

Come on."
2021-05-13 16:06:31,wallstreetbets,"Either he's drunk or he's referring to back in 2016.

Except that was $32 up from about $30, and 2016 AMC has very little in common with current AMC so... probably drunk."
2021-05-13 14:06:22,wallstreetbets,Yesss
2021-05-13 12:49:35,wallstreetbets,This person holds
2021-05-13 13:09:28,wallstreetbets,"Ah that‚Äôs right this is WSB, where retards come together"
2021-05-13 13:08:58,wallstreetbets,Please provide me a real resource then. Why would HF‚Äôs want to short a company that‚Äôs just been saved from bankruptcy and can start doing operations like before again?
2021-05-13 13:25:21,wallstreetbets,So are you saying GME is at 200% SI? And do you have any source to support your arguments?
2021-05-13 13:49:39,wallstreetbets,Do you have a source for this bold claim that SI is secretly 10x the official numbers?
2021-05-13 18:12:26,wallstreetbets,"Which is why gme won‚Äôt ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù either. Because it already happened. It‚Äôs hilarious how many people just learned what a short squeeze is this year and think that everything is going to squeeze, and if SI isn‚Äôt adequate to merit such a claim- they just move goalposts and say ‚Äúbut muh dark pools‚Äù or ‚Äúthey have to cover‚Äù

Newsflash: no they don‚Äôt have to cover, and if you think existing shorts are at the same entry points as the ones which led to the squeeze in January- I have a bridge to sell ya."

2021-05-13 15:26:51,wallstreetbets,"GME is an entirely different ballgame in terms of their business model, debt, and prospects for a future. I don't think GME is a $150 stock but $40-75 seems plausible depending on how well they do in eCommerce. It's over hyped but there is reason to believe they can do something.

AMC has huge debts diminishing capacity to repay it. It lost $1.40 a share last quarter alone. Literally the only reason it's not bankrupt now is that retail traders are buying it's debt via new share sales hoping to get rich quick."
2021-05-13 19:06:20,wallstreetbets,"You're literally trying to shame other AMC holders into not selling.

That's *pathetic*."

2021-05-13 13:07:18,wallstreetbets,"GME shares are cheap to borrow for short sellers (1%) AMC are expensive (74%). Thus, there is pressure on short sellers to cover their position, which means buying back the shares on the market, in AMC but not GME."

GME has its issues, but it won't be from lack of talent at the top."

2021-05-13 12:47:58,wallstreetbets,"Nothing wrong with taking profit man. This one could also fizzle out. I think though as long as borrowing fee is this high (>70%) and price doesn‚Äôt drop, there is pressure on shorts to cover. But unlike GME where Melvin held almost all the shorts, this time there are likely many short holders, and some of them might be able to ride this one through."

2021-05-13 18:12:51,wallstreetbets,"? I've been trading longer than 3 months. Just because I recently started posting about YOLOing money into stocks doesn't mean i haven't been trading for years, or understand basic math."

Sub now is unreal. People thinking that charging into every moderately-shorted stock is going to initiate a squeeze without ever understanding how rare that is. Or you know, considering that plowing headfirst into high-SI stocks isn't exactly the soundest of investing strategy."
2021-05-13 13:16:21,wallstreetbets,"Bro, you can‚Äôt reason with the cult. They literally believe every single person is lying about short interest. 

How do you debate with someone who just says everything is a lie?"
2021-05-13 13:16:20,wallstreetbets,I'm confused. They already took out a shit load of shorts waaay back and then continued to double down at various points since the price went out of control right?
2021-05-13 13:36:07,wallstreetbets,"There's been a ton of DD on WSB with models calculating the real amount of shorts, estimates ranging from %120-%1000 of the float, where have you been for the last 3 months fellow ape? Catch up!"

2021-05-13 18:17:18,wallstreetbets,"The point of a floor is to hold for a lengthy amount of time to assure opportunity. If apes sell off early the rocket stops mid-air and plummets back to earth. If people hold, the rocket continues into the stratosphere going high and higher because that's how a squeeze works. If you don't sell they can't buy. This is why selling only small amounts at a time and preferably during the downswing is my plan. And this is also why people have high floors. It's not for the panic sellers or the weak.

Not financial advice. I am not an expert at anything."

I thought the whole thing was that GME was shorted up the wazoo and is priced way higher than the shorters ever expected?"
2021-05-13 13:32:01,wallstreetbets,"Shares are 'cheap' to borrow for GME because NO ONE IS BORROWING THEM. Only institutions have the ability to, and the supply is incredibly low compared to what it used to be.

The fee is low to try and get buyers for them. Not because it's cheap/easy to short."

> AMC said it had 3.2 million individual shareholders as of March 11, who own about 80% of the 450 million shares outstanding."

2021-05-13 13:26:37,wallstreetbets,"So you're saying they're not holding a shit load of shorts from waaay back when the price was lower.
The DD I've seen on the amc subbreddit shows they haven't covered, hence the price"
2021-05-13 13:48:21,wallstreetbets,"Because you don't need it to go bankrupt to turn a profit. It's possible for companies to turn a profit and still be obscenely overvalued and have their share price fall significantly. See TSLA for an example. 

But make no mistake, AMC is still in deep shit. They've been saved from bankruptcy *for now*, but even if they go right back to 100% pre-COVID attendance today, they're still not in a great position and will likely continue bleeding money. They still have a shitton of debt, their liabilities exceed their assets, and part of how they survived 2020 was negotiating with landlords and creditors to defer a lot of expenses to this year. 

In a good year they have thin margins. Even with pre-COVID attendance, the increase in their debt and rent costs alone will keep them in the red. Add in that they won't be at pre-COVID attendance for a while (reduced capacity in most theaters set to continue for months, studios are bypassing theaters and releasing movies straight to their own streaming platforms), it's not a stretch to think AMC is ridiculously overvalued. Its market cap is higher now than it EVER was pre-COVID, because they've literally quadrupled the number of shares in less than a year and apes keep buying them thinking they're gonna get rich from a squeeze that isn't gonna happen."

2021-05-13 14:11:27,wallstreetbets,And it's still holding high at ~$150
2021-05-13 18:11:21,wallstreetbets,"No one retail side is borrowing because they literally can't. 

Try contacting interactive brokers or another lender and see if you can get shares. They will explain how it is extremely hard to borrow. Only institutions (read: market makers)are able to actually get shares to borrow.

Since demand is so low, the fee is low. But demand is low because of how fucked the situation is. Not because 'shorts have covered'. Short interest volume, compared to trading volume, is through the roof every day. These are institutions trying to hold back the apes."
2021-05-13 13:12:11,wallstreetbets,"We'll see. Might not matter though. The squeeze is a big pull factor in itself. 

But hey've done very well during the pandemic,  they're online sales are increasing. But yeah I can't say anything for sure how they'll do in that sector over time. Ryan Cohen did well with Chewy vs Amazon.  I believe in them."

2021-05-13 13:31:28,wallstreetbets,"the hedge funds are overleveraged to the tits. 

Borrow fees are 84%, 1/3 of the float is on loan,  ZERO available shares to short. AMC finished selling off available shares and price ROSE 20%. This has been manipulated as much as GME, and the only shares available are probably synths, so we're going to the FUCKING MOON. 500k FLOOR.  

GET THE FUCK ON THE ROCKET FRIEND."
2021-05-13 14:07:32,wallstreetbets,"Bro I took profits at 13.75 or something. The same cats who says rocket ships to the mooon are the guys asking you why you didn‚Äôt take profits at the top like they did.

2021-05-13 17:10:31,wallstreetbets,"it be like that sometimes. This is just a single days move off the restriction of dark pool connections to the NYSE, and we are still up 20%.

I've been holding and buying since 3 bucks. 

I can wait another week or two. :D"
2021-05-13 13:47:27,wallstreetbets,You sold at 12 and it‚Äôs already 13 now. 15 or 16 isn‚Äôt even a speed bump.
2021-05-13 13:58:21,wallstreetbets,it's gambling. this sub is an echo chamber so i would suggest looking elsewhere for level headed analysis.
2021-05-13 13:48:50,wallstreetbets,In Feb of last year before the pandemic they were at around $7... and they have added shares since then. This is WSB hype.. just bought puts personally for 45 days out at some delightful prices. We MAY see another price hike if any summer movies get announced but I think the current pricing is going to take a hit pretty heavily before or after that happens
2021-05-13 13:50:30,wallstreetbets,"Here's what I've learned from thousands of dollars of loss doing stupid shit.

If you want to play calls, and you have literally fuck-all of an idea for what you're doing, buy yourself some time insurance. If you buy a 5/14 13 Put for AMC while it's at $13 because you think it's going to crash and burn tomorrow, it might and you might make 2x your investment depending on how low it goes.

if it doesn't, and it continues higher or hangs out at the peak and never drops, your Put play is now basically worth a pound of dry dog turds.

This is a massive oversimplification, but what I've started doing is adding a couple of weeks to whatever call/put play I think I have that might be a good idea. You might net 1.5x instead of 2x, but if you think you have a good idea, you're insulating it to some degree from turbulence.

read investopedia. Spend a little money on Puts or Calls without risking your whole investment. Buy 1, ONE SINGLE CALL OR PUT.   


Watch how they move, and after you think you're ready, yolo your ass off by all means.

That concept is anathema to this whole sub, but fuck it."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Reaction to inflation concerns I‚Äôm not sure why the inflation concerns seem to be benefitting certain companies but not others, when both would conceivably stand to benefit. I understand the traditional concerns, and the logic for why it would affect growth stocks (particularly from the standpoint of the probable interest rate increase that would accompany this inflation).

But why is it that for a company like GM, where the inflation would in theory equal more revenue on every car sale, be a benefit, but for a company like Snapchat, where revenue on ads should increase with inflation, they are getting hammered? I feel like inflation as a whole should be a concern but how it seems to be pricing itself doesn‚Äôt make sense. I just want to note I‚Äôm not invested in either of these companies, I‚Äôm just trying to use two examples (there are likely better examples for that matter). 

If someone has an explanation that I‚Äôm missing I would love to hear it."
2021-05-13 12:00:46,wallstreetbets,"The concern of inflation is the cost of living. As it rise too much people will start to tighten their budget. This will have a major impact on the economy. Consider we are getting out of a 1yr lockdown, any economic slowdown will cause a major problem.  The reason for the inflation is massive printing the fed has been doing for a year now. Not to mention infinite low interest rates."
2021-05-13 12:39:48,wallstreetbets,"This isn't about inflation, per se.  The concern is interest rates will rise sooner because of inflation.  If interest rates rise, dollars made now (e.g. dividends) increase in value and future revenues (growth) decreases.  We have been living in low interest rate environment since GFC, so growth has bren bid up.  At 2% interest most growthy stocks going to take a 30+% valuation cut, minimum."

Cash value depreciates, but if you own any assets those should inflate alongside it. The people who could afford a truck before likely still afford it now. Historically, inflation benefits companies like GM that make products on tight margins."
2021-05-13 12:00:57,wallstreetbets,That would depend on who their target market is. Let‚Äôs not forget that most people are financing assets like vehicles versus outright buying ads.

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What's with the media's never-ending shill on CPI data? iNfLaTiOn Is +4.2% yOy, hIgHeSt SiNcE 2008. DUH. Yo2Y makes more sense as I demonstrate here. Note that I am not a fan of CPI. Inflation was already here a long time ago. So please spare me from using CPI. I am just sick of the media choosing to play easy journalism, in turn, putting so much pressure on ape stocks. BUT, this is a great buying op and here's why.

TLDR: CPI %Change number is COVID-biased. The actual number is not high. Inflation is already priced in.

Since yesterday all the channels have slammed ape stocks with the CPI data saying its YoY number was ATH since 2008. It's not fair to use YoY numbers because COVID messed up the trajectory of the CPI. The YoY 2019-2020 April number barely changed (from 255.548 to 256.389)[ https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/), which created stored energy that MUST be realized once the economy started recovering. The latest number of 267.054 is justified because it put the number back into the previous trajectory. In simple terms, the +4.2% seems huge because April 2020's number was frozen by COVID.

It's more appropriate to use Yo2Y number in this case (actually, in many other cases too as broader scope = more smoothened/accurate, less squared error). Think of it this way, without COVID, the number would not have been different than what we have now. The number should still be in the range of 264 - 268.

YoY, It's fair to say +4.16% is huge as it has not been this much since 2008 Sep.

[YoY](https://preview.redd.it/q1exbb7s2wy61.jpg?width=1892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a6d0ff66f3c9da03fed8f0217ce8431eb057668)

However, if we smooth the data with a Yo2Y calculation, an increase of +4.5% over a period of **TWO** years is so common. The average number is +3.8% (this means +3.8% in **TWO** years).

[Yo2Y](https://preview.redd.it/ft5ukqtt2wy61.jpg?width=1892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17854220026ae80337519a3b9c356fa06a1cb3fd)

Please shut the fuck up about CPI. The use of CPI is retarded, but the way it's being brandished is even more retarded.

IMO, Inflation has already been priced in as, currently, KO has a higher P/E than AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, BABA by more than 10%. These are not ape stocks, but my point stands as ""value"" stocks are overpriced than these tech stocks.

It's important that you know this because stupid journalism is making the price discovery process fucked. Investors flee to safe big cap stocks, making them overvalued. These big cap stocks then use these undeserved overvaluations to:

* afford massive ads budget so that it can shove stupid just-to-be-seen ads in your face. I don't want another Coke or Fanta ads to sell me the same message over and over for decades. It's an absolute waste of time and resource.
* lobby. Boy oh boy, where do I even start?
* take over other small companies.

The list goes on.

Peace"

Everyone who was on vacation collecting green weenies will rush to find any job they can so they don‚Äôt starve thus pushing wages down. Housing moratorium ending will have the same effect. More houses will flood the market pushing prices down. Rents go down because they are no longer subsidizing non paying tenets. Prices might be sticky for a little bit BUT should come down. Factory output will stabilize not too long after. Inflation is happening, but me thinks it‚Äôs temporary.

I think the TLDR would be buy stocks that consistently grow their revenue, earnings, net income, etc lame ass Warren buffet stuff. Typical stuff.  I don‚Äôt read stocks financial statements because I don‚Äôt have enough time.

I think it‚Äôs awesome people are YOLO‚Äôing and taking risk.  If you‚Äôre curious Id like to know your age and what % of portfolio.
I almost yolo‚Äôd my similar size Roth out of Fidelity‚Äôs blue chip growth fund into TSLA today but my wife was like wtf you don‚Äôt need to do that, we‚Äôre still in our 20‚Äôs, although about to be 30. I canceled the order because I figure 10k is Tesla is good enough and I‚Äôll just chip into Tesla next paycheck.

Anyways, I think GameStop is a terrible idea. I‚Äôll tell why soon. -I work in real estate and they didn‚Äôt even do a 1 year lease renewal at the same rent, they were begging for a rent reduction.  I don‚Äôt do one year leases for a tenant that has extended their business model beyond its viable length due to genius ability to adapt to survive.  

Here‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs a terrible idea.  Blockbuster had a good run, Kmart had a good run, sometimes it just ends.  GameStop doesn‚Äôt have any key advantages left, it‚Äôs not even big enough to be a category killer type store like Best Buy or Ulta.  They occupy 1500-2000 sq ft which Walmart and target just copy inside there store, 2nd msft and Sony have created the store on their game system, you don‚Äôt even have to leave your house and you can store your credit cards on file(this is a wet dream, MSFT can just middleman this stuff through their App Store), 3rd physical disks are kind of lame to put in to play when digital is easy to swap from game to game, 4 even if you buy a hard copy you still have to update sometimes. 5 I don‚Äôt know this isn‚Äôt financial advice, buying TQQQ would be a better choice if you want to gamble or TSLA or just be lame and get VTSAX"

The 1 year lease request doesn't bother me.  I believe that they will be changing the way their stores function and that they will need a larger footprint for each location soon.  Some of the changes I believe they will make will replace revenue lost to competitors on physical game sales.  

The company is debt free, and just raised half a billion in capital through a stock offering.  They aren't a dying company by any stretch of the imagination.  They have a revitalized executive team and appear to be making quick changes that benefit the company.

It is a yolo and I understand the risks.  That being said I'm extremely happy with my 8.6% gain today.  

Regardless of the stock experiencing any type of squeeze I believe in the fundamentals of the company and their digital transformation.  And if it does squeeze then all the better."

2021-05-13 15:11:21,wallstreetbets,You seem really confused about the mechanics of short selling. You make money by shorting the stock when it is high and buying it back when it is low. Therefore the best time to short is when the stock is green and the best time to cover is when the stock is red.

I'm appointed to sell multiple companies in multiple states in the Midwest US. I DO NOT own ANY healthcare stocks, so I don't have a dog in this fight. I only learned what $CLOV did yesterday after seeing posted all over WSB. My intention is to let you know that $CLOV is a bad play. 

TLDR at the bottom as well as sources. Graphs along the way. Enjoy :)

 General information about Medicare directly from cms.gov:

# Medicare Program - General Information

### Medicare is a health insurance program for:

* ^(People age 65 or older.)
* ^(People under age 65 with certain disabilities.)
* ^(People of all ages with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a kidney transplant).)

### Medicare has different parts that help cover specific services:

**Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) -** Part A helps cover inpatient care in hospitals, including critical access hospitals, and skilled nursing facilities (not custodial or long-term care). It also helps cover hospice care and some home health care. Beneficiaries must meet certain conditions to get these benefits. Most people don't pay a premium for Part A because they or a spouse already paid for it through their payroll taxes while working.

**Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) -** Part B helps cover doctors' services and outpatient care. It also covers some other medical services that Part A doesn't cover, such as some of the services of physical and occupational therapists, and some home health care. Part B helps pay for these covered services and supplies when they are medically necessary. Most people pay a monthly premium for Part B.

**Medicare Part D (Prescription Drug Coverage) -** Medicare prescription drug coverage is available to everyone with Medicare. To get Medicare prescription drug coverage, people must join a plan approved by Medicare that offers Medicare drug coverage. Most people pay a monthly premium for Part D.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

Private insurance companies offer benefits in addition to original Medicare in the form of a Medicare Supplement or Medicare Advantage plan. A recipient will enroll in either a Medicare Supplement or Medicare Advantage plan, they can't have both.  Below you'll see Q4 2020 enrollments including Med Sup and MA, you'll see there is a far larger market share for supplements than advantage plans. $CLOV only offers MA, they do not offer supplements which was . 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But that data is from 2016.... it's the most recent I could find. Enrollment in Medicare Advantage (MA) continues to grow at a steady rate as more (more than 8% last year) and more Americans are entering retirement. Yet, only 43% of the nearly 63 million people eligible for Medicare are enrolled in a MA in 2020. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xh4wkhjbfwy61.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=4535ec64a83101f560f9c095fa293c6d0829c01f

**Medicare Advantage is a GROWING market, but does that growth have room for $CLOV as a major player?** I don't see it. As you'll see below the large companies make up most of the market share in the Medicare Advantage space, and they do it well. That 18% of ""all other insurers"" is where $CLOV fits into the graph below. What concerns me about $CLOV is that a majority of those ""other"" companies are not-for-profit and affiliated with small networks and hospital group. Why is $CLOV operating for profit and publicly traded in this space. The SEC has questions as well. Red flags. 

https://preview.redd.it/1agsakcmfwy61.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce2403669147e7715b6f7aa32bd2b7550a727e3

The major carries include many extra benefits that seniors love, especially the fitness membership benefits included on most of the major plans. Looking through Clovers website I only saw dental/vision/hearing benefit included. These are usually a small reimbursement or a percentage discount for services and not comprehensive benefits you would expect. 

https://preview.redd.it/mbmrmc5xfwy61.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a59d811d8cb6968e1a4b875cf8ecc29e3d66e9

Speaking of their website, it is very generic. See for yourself: [https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/plans](https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/plans)

Compare it to other major carriers: [https://www.humana.com/](https://www.humana.com/) [https://www.aarpmedicareplans.com/](https://www.aarpmedicareplans.com/) 

[https://www.aetnaseniorproducts.com/ssi/index.html](https://www.aetnaseniorproducts.com/ssi/index.html)

Decide for yourself as a customer which you'd feel the most comfortable with. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**They're a 3 star company y'all, what are you buying?**

Again, major carriers are doing well in this space, and they're benefiting from doing well. $CLOV claims on their website that they are doing healthcare differently but their model is exactly the same as every other carrier with fewer features and benefits than most. Their customer service must be amazing then, right? Luckily the CMS measures this in the form of a star rating they assign to each carrier every year. As part of a Medicare Advantage appointment we are required to review a companies Star Rating with the member. The Star rating is a score provide by CMS that assess customer service and quality of care. You'll see below that the star rating is an increasingly important factor in enrollment, and that 78% of enrollments are in plans with 4 for more star.

https://preview.redd.it/0slqosx8gwy61.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2a930f0fb874df4190b69cfe5d60b42ff47dc59

You'll see Clovers most recent star rating below. They have a 3 and 3.5 star rating, which is not attractive to the consumer at all. As a broker I would be concerned, if the consumer isn't happy with the plan they might switch to a different plan next year with a different broker. I want my clients to have a positive experience with the plan they enroll in, I want them to tell their friends, I want their referrals. I would caution enrolling a customer in a 3 star plan.

https://preview.redd.it/ggf42tmdgwy61.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=282dcfea99c4f6f3e12229793db1f81b217d0b01

**Oh and there's that thing about them being approved as a direct contracting entity, that must be big news, right?** No, do you even know what that means. Let me explain. This is basically a pilot program that 53 carriers are participating in throughout the country. 53 is a lot btw. When a customer enrolls in a MA plan they have to designate their primary care physician (PCP). Under the direct contracting model the MA plan will pay the PCP a specific dollar amount per member, like a membership. In return the doctor will provide services to the member but not charge the plan per service, since they are receiving payment for care upfront overtime. This is basically to see if this model is more cost effective than the fee-for-service model. The customer will still received itemized statements as they would under the traditional fee-for-service model. So essential the customer doesn't notice anything different is happening, other then they likely will not have a copay or possibly a lower copay. But this doesn't make $CLOV unique in any way.

**TLDR: Clover Health Investments is not doing anything of value in the Medicare Space. I'm sorry but your bags look heavy.**

They also are not a PPO model which the others plans generally are, and they pay their physicians more while collecting additional clinically accurate data on their members. Data is the new oil.

2021-05-13 19:38:41,wallstreetbets,Medicare advantage is a scam as is everything else  advertised on Fox News.

2021-05-13 14:10:42,wallstreetbets,Finally someone who has intelligence. May calls are toast. So sad.
2021-05-13 12:45:24,wallstreetbets,"Thank you.  I was having doubts but this solidified it.

It's funny how people instantly disregard opposing viewpoints without anything to back it up.  Maybe that is just the culture we live in now.  All opinion, nothing backing that opinion but their feelings or hopes.

That said, it very well could shoot up because markets can be irrational.  I'm not investing in it though.  Thanks for your research and time!"
2021-05-13 15:15:20,wallstreetbets,"I like how you think the way the website looks matters to the business model (it doesn‚Äôt) and you conveniently don‚Äôt discuss their TECHNOLOGY that makes them an insurtech company using AI to connect medical data.  

That‚Äôs what sets them apart.  

Those big companies don‚Äôt do what clover does as a tech company, and their systems are too old to catch up"

2021-05-13 12:05:56,wallstreetbets,"Community college grad! Thank you :) And no, the point is not that they are too small. If they were small and innovative I'd look at it differently. They're selling you an idea that they are unique in terms of managed care, data collection, and payment system and they are not. It is easy to appear that way but what they are doing is exactly what Medicare advantage is suppose to do and they're not even doing it well. From a broker perspective I would not enroll a client in this plan if they are suitable options, it would literally be my last choice because the big guys can offer so much and they're already doing it well. Best case is if CLOV was doing something innovative that would be swallowed up by a larger player and I don't even see that. They may grow but they're never going to have market share in this space. And there are some red flags so I'm just saying I'd stay away, but by all means do your own research and make your own decision."
2021-05-13 15:49:14,wallstreetbets,"What I was attempting to do is provide a market view perspective. I match Medicare buyers with companies and there are many factors to consider when partnering with a company to sell. Clove isn‚Äôt in my selling region but if they were I wouldn‚Äôt be warm and fuzzy about contracting with them. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them to a customer, not with a 3 star rating. I have questions and no one has been able to answer them. What is setting $clov apart in its industry that will cause enrollments to sore and thereby increasing its stock price? I personally wouldn‚Äôt sell it, but I‚Äôm not everyone. Always willing to learn more.

Edited to clarify that I would not recommend."
2021-05-13 15:41:08,wallstreetbets,"No one has disregarded opposing viewpoints without anything to back it up? Have you done any research yourself into clov? Because if you did even 5 minutes on the wiki on the clov subreddit you would see that no one is investing with anything to ""back it up""

2021-05-13 17:35:08,wallstreetbets,"Your comment to OP proved my point exactly.

1. It's ok if someone sees something different than you.  It doesn't affect your life.
2. It's good to have opposing viewpoints to find weakness of a thesis.  People see things differently and that's good.
3. My viewpoints or viewpoints of OP do not affect your positions or conviction of the stock.  You come off offended that people think differently than you.  If you disagree with something specific, point it out.  OP has been writing in good faith for his post and comments.  

I tend agree with OP that there isn't anything special about the tech.  If something is going to upend a market as entrenched as Medicare, it better be freaking amazing.  I don't see it and so I'm not buying.  

It's great that you do.  Good luck to you and I hope you win big and it goes to $20."

It just beat earnings again but because the big money is trying to cycle out of fintech, this company is being attacked by shorts. 

The SI% has skyrocketed and is now at 31%. Even though it has the numbers, increasing revenues, banks are climbing over themselves to partner with this tech, etc. the price is being beaten down by a bunch of douche bags on wallstreet."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Retail sales figures tomorrow, my thoughts Tomorrow (8:30AM) they are releasing retail sales figures. I believe these figures are going to be on par or less than what we saw in March. In March we saw an increase in consumer spending, in part due to COVID restrictions being lifted and the $1,400 stimulus checks. At the same time we also saw a plateau in unemployment and a slow down in vaccinations due to hesitation after the Johnson&Johnson vaccine was halted.  This combined with inflation fears and the end of unemployment assistance leads me to the conclusion that spending may have plateaued and potentially even decreased compared to last month."

2021-05-13 13:42:32,wallstreetbets,"You're basing your whole argument on a few people caught stocking up on gas?

Edit: forgot to address the housing, it really depends on where you look. For instance, highly populated areas in California and New York have seen a decrease in population as those people are moving to places like Florida with less restrictions. Driving up prices and making it more difficult for locals to buy homes in those areas. I'm a real estate broker.

The home sales aren't due to a sudden surge in home ownership, its mainly due to people migrating. Notably from higher cost areas to lower cost areas."
2021-05-13 13:47:30,wallstreetbets,i said houses first but the gas thing just shows general hoarding mentality your premise has no valid data points other than the stimmy which i guess you assume were spent immediately even though savings rates have never been higher.
2021-05-13 14:04:24,wallstreetbets,"See previous comment.

Also, data has been gathered on how Americans used the stimulus checks.

compared to the second stimulus check, an increase of 10% placed the third check in savings / investment's. The vast majority of checks were used to pay off debt and bills."

2021-05-13 11:36:33,wallstreetbets,"approximately: today is t, tomorrow is t+1, so on.

\- flip a coin to see if it will go up or down t+1, flip again for t+2, flip until t+n (n days in the future)

\- repeat this 100 million times (hire them smart kids from singapore)

\- and then you have 100 million hypothetical evolutions of the stonk. The chart shows the best 75% I think, the worst 1%, the EXP is the average of the millions of hypothetical evolutions, probably.

&#x200B;

hope this helps. flipping the coin is a simplification, what you do is you see how the stonk behaves in the past and you create a coin that flips just like stonk does, and then you flip that coin, which might be a bit different than the 1/2 chance a normal coin has. If the past distribution is exactly 50% 50% your simulation is probably worthless.

The main issue is that people don't understand it yet.  But believe me, once Fortune 500 CEOs figure out that their competitors are saving 10s of millions per year using it, you bet your ass they'll be asking their team why they aren't using it yet"

2021-05-13 14:41:51,wallstreetbets,"Here's a problem commonly found in tech. How do you unify things together? The medicine field is horribly bastardized by the American healthcare system. Medical documents and studies are often trapped in a single private company and becomes difficult to access anywhere else. PLTR is a software that, and i quote from their demo day, ""is the connective tissue"" that can link together that data and community. When it comes to medicine, security and efficiency is imperative to success. That's why PLTR played a significant role helping the CDC roll out the covid vaccine. PLTR is a software that unifies data, and gives it's customers a flexible easy to use application to send data, build projects, and maintain security all in a single system. PLTR's Foundry platform allows customers to program scripts to create automated systems based on data changes in the company, write documentation for large companies to easily understand each other, and provides a communication systems to speed up bureaucracy. PLTR is a software that is applicable to any kind of company with a lot of data, which is pretty much any large scale company.... PLTR is dipping real hard now because most people lack this understanding, but PLTR will make waves in the backend of any company. I'm real excited to see what they plan on doing with the medical industry in particular. They just released news about partnering with an institution that conducts cancer studies. And they already have the us government in it's claws. Doubtful the military will ever let go of them. Message me if you want more info, i encourage you to watch their most recent live demo day."
2021-05-13 14:00:17,wallstreetbets,They build custom data analysis software. Its sort of like the Salesforce of data analysis and machine learning. They are pulling massive new contracts every single day.

I could go through a bureaucractic process to get a VP to talk to another VP to get time from a team that knows where we have cell towers and also the real estate team to figure out where we could put it and maybe a finance team to see if we can afford it.

Or you could have a solution that makes all that info easily accessible to me and cut through the red tape.

2021-05-13 14:25:32,wallstreetbets,Lol maybe in Military applications but the US pockets are rather shallow when it comes to other agencies. For reference the feds I worked with at the DOJ used Palantir on and off while having it's contract expire and renew various times so it wasn't even a continuous contract. At one point the attorneys were sick of the flip flopping so they just stopped using it all together. I preferred NUIX anyway.

2021-05-13 10:38:59,wallstreetbets,"In my humble opinion what's happening with tilray being over sold with news that people don't quite understand. I been following aphria since last year because I owned some shares. The reason why I bought aphria last year was because I looked at it's balance sheet like i do with any other company ( I almost finished my accounting degree a few years back). I found that it had a very healthy and strong balance sheet. You always have to look at the company balance sheet so you can see how it's doing in the present and how it was doing a few years back. The reason why is because you need to compare how the ceo and management are managing the company. From what I saw from the balance sheet was that the ceo Irwin simon and his managers were doing a fantastic job because they had alot of cash in the bank from sales and operations compare to other cannabis companies including tilray. Aphria had alot of cash to simply buy Sweetwater from the u.s on November 2020 to have a foot in the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana. Tilray on the other hand is trying to get into other countries for it's medical marijuana and got a great deal when they gave tilray the permission to distribute it's medical marijuana in the united Kingdom on February 2021. Tilray has more countries to distribute it's medical marijuana and it also bought Manitoba Harvest to also have a foot into the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana, it's easy to look up this information. But germany and Canada are the biggest market for both aphria and tilray. The reason why am naming this two countries is because ladies and gentleman this two countries have been in lockdowns and so have other European nations in these past months. What the hell does that matter some may say, well if these countries went into lockdowns how can aphria and tilray make money. That's the reason why thier sales went down by alot this past quarter because they had no control over these lockdowns. You can check how much money aphria and tilray made in sales in 2020 and compare. Once these lockdowns have been lifted they will again start to make what they have been making. Aphria and tilray weren't named the biggest company based on sales for no reason. They will clearly be one of the leaders in the cannabis industry. I really can't understand how Canopy is valued at $40 while the new tilray is trading below $15 , which to me is dirt cheap. Tilray just reported out it's first quarter but people have to understand that they just reported the old tilray sales and not the new tilray ( aphria and tilray). As these lockdowns have been lifted and Europe is starting to open and the ceo Irwin simons and his managers start to manage the new tilray I see the company price jumping up close to where these past analyst are putting thier fair value price targets easily. I am in no means a financial advisor or an expert. Am just an informed trader and all the information I just gave can be easily looked up online. People have to get informed before making trades so please trade at your own risk and always verify any information you look up online."

2021-05-13 11:29:44,wallstreetbets,"As Mark Cuban said, pick a broker that has a trillion dollars under assets. Look into Fidelity or Vanguard. The UI could be better but at least you have some peace of mind"
2021-05-13 16:02:11,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity will be revamping their mobile app soon and they have the money to pay someone to make it better than Robinhood. They are a really great broker anyways.

If you base your broker off of their mobile app then you are retarded. Here's a copypasta I posted after Robinhood screwed everyone over.

2021-05-13 10:40:53,wallstreetbets,Can't disagree with that at all. Robinhood is notorious for stating they have a high volume of activity and then preventing/limiting users from buying or selling. Also just preventing people from selling without advance notification.
2021-05-13 13:44:12,wallstreetbets,Buy\* They wont stop him from selling.
2021-05-13 11:01:29,wallstreetbets,You have to downgrade. Everyone by default on robinhood is a margin account even if you're not borrowing money.
2021-05-13 14:35:29,wallstreetbets,I used TD Ameritrade as well it has a lot of great tools and pretty simple to use.

2021-05-13 11:43:52,wallstreetbets,Fidelity has amazing customer support and is my top pick. Can also confirm that UI is horrible but that is why I use MarketWatch and WeBull to watch charts.
2021-05-13 15:28:03,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in TD but I heard Fidelity is coming out with an app with better UI

2021-05-13 15:00:47,wallstreetbets,I had to email them. You have to disable options trading first though (even if you don‚Äôt have open positions it needs to be disabled).
2021-05-13 15:08:52,wallstreetbets,You have to go to day trade settings and disable instant settlement. But fuck RH and go to fidelity.

2021-05-13 13:58:54,wallstreetbets,You have to enable realtime data. (It's free)
2021-05-13 14:05:33,wallstreetbets,You have to enable real-time
2021-05-13 16:32:47,wallstreetbets,On the app you have to enable the real time update. In their web interface it doesn't update in real time. In their desktop program they update in real time.
2021-05-13 14:39:26,wallstreetbets,"Yep, be careful"
2021-05-13 18:22:00,wallstreetbets,"the june 9 meeting and the fact that there will be more votes than shares seems like it would be the only sure fire way to force a squeeze once gamestop rejects the vote, but we'll see"

2021-05-13 09:51:31,wallstreetbets,Hope everything turns around for you. Last couple weeks have been rough so I turned to scalping calls after a lot of consecutive days red. If a FAANG is was about to break its red days consecutive record I buy calls at the last days low and flip them. This is the first time I yolod it.
2021-05-13 10:39:20,wallstreetbets,Damn! You can MAKE money in the market?
2021-05-13 09:39:05,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a yolo. The money will continue to used as blatant yolos based on nothing but air.
2021-05-13 10:26:45,wallstreetbets,No the boyfriend and I swap cameraman positions. So last time it was posted under his name. Tomorrow‚Äôs video will be both of use and her new new boyfriend filming. It‚Äôll be under my username again. FuckMeWhileWeFuckMyWife
2021-05-13 10:13:49,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs at $5.1 but I don‚Äôt have diamond hands. I‚Äôll take my little bread.
2021-05-13 10:50:58,wallstreetbets,It is a symbol given by the ape gods once you have sacrificed your care for money and material things. It is only given to those that separate themselves from the living world and into a purgatory of emotionless gains. That no matter what number is after the + you don‚Äôt care. Because you don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a + or a - it‚Äôs all nothing to you because you are nothing to you now.
2021-05-13 10:58:58,wallstreetbets,Degenerate not idiot. Idiots don‚Äôt know better. I do I just choose not to because I‚Äôm a degenerate.

2021-05-13 19:44:21,wallstreetbets,"Replicating what I said there because nobody gave a shit the first time round:

Some of it's aight though.  As with every tool, there's a time and a place.  Right now we're in the bokeh in 2014 or sidechaining in 2017 or being a p√¶dophile that works in British television in the 70's, 80's, 90's, and 00's phase of AI interpolation.

One that sticks out particularly well in my mind is some JoJo character with wings wafting in the wind, and it really fits.  It almost looks like the interpolated version was an original 3D modelled animation that was traced at limited FPS to stylise it.  When artists decide to stop being such nancy fucks about this technological development, we'll see them drawing some things specifically for the purpose of interpolating them themselves.

Hell, maybe it will even be a good work saver for certain things - like I was saying about how that JoJo thing looked, you could animate a scene with low poly featureless 3D models to quickly play around with an idea, refine it a bit with some stretch'n'squish, draw over it at limited FPS and high detail to look sweet af, then AI interpolate the framerate up a bit to get some frames for ""free"", so to speak.

I know that artists come out with some fuckin' top tier shit when they lean hard into a new style, technique, or technology, rather than fighting against it, or trying to molest the new thing into looking like the old thing.  Look at Land of the Lustrous for instance.  So many people pisswhinging about 3D's overuse in anime, and it's because people are trying to make it look anime, rather than using the new(er lmao) medium to its potential."

2021-05-13 13:14:58,wallstreetbets,"it's just idol culture (common in asia) taken online with an anime skin slapped over it. It's not complicated if you understand asian ""pop idols"" like BTS and AKB48. It's hardly different. Again, just an anime skin slapped over it. Since ""hardcore"" idol culture is pretty uniquely asian, none of those girls (and guys) expected to get popular overseas, they are routinely confounded by the number of ""overseas"" viewers in their streams."

Hololive girls so far have generally just said that you can watch clips as you like, showing up is support enough, and will actively discourage donations if they feel it's excessive. I know it is all a character they're playing out but it's pleasant and they're funny and I never feel that toxic pressure I felt from certain types of real people streamers"

2021-05-13 14:43:17,wallstreetbets,There's something very creepy to me about the infatuation people have with the personalities. The fetishism of adolescent behavior that goes on from a subset of users there makes it a hard pass for me. Some of the lewd posts on Hololive should probably be reported somewhere.

Twitch streamers can be like you said, and it just feels so shallow. Unless it‚Äôs another VTuber, someone like Melody, Froot, or Snuffy, because they are just as happy to have fans over cash."
2021-05-13 19:51:16,wallstreetbets,"To be fair to them, that was one streamer once, and it blew up.  Sure there are more of them out there, and VTubers are more likely to beg you to stop donating money than the other way around, but let's not pretend everyone who isn't a VTuber is trash."
2021-05-13 15:52:18,wallstreetbets,"Oh, for sure. If I could understand Japanese as well as I do English, I‚Äôd probably watch Korone‚Äôs and Botan‚Äôs streams live at every opportunity, but I have to rely on translated clips. Because of clippers and translators, I get to experience highlights at least, and I‚Äôm plenty thankful for that."
2021-05-13 15:09:34,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much every member of Hololive is particularly talented in an area that usually falls under music, art, gaming skills, or just overall entertainment ability. For example, Minato Aqua is an incredibly good Apex Legends player (I‚Äôve seen her finish matches with 16+ kills before) whereas Mori Calliope is a rapper with fantastic lyric-writing skills ([here‚Äôs](https://youtu.be/SXBla6USb78) a clip of her rapping the fastest part of Eminem‚Äôs ‚ÄúGodzilla‚Äù)."
2021-05-13 16:06:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, fetishizing ANYTHING is creepy, from personality types, to race, to age. I know I‚Äôm probably the minority in this instance, but overtly lewd stuff of the talents disturb me. Like...those are real people behind those avatars, you know? It‚Äôs weird. I know the talents don‚Äôt mind risqu√© stuff, they even sell some goods that back that up, but there‚Äôs a limit.

That aside, there are plenty of personalities, most of which are mature or relatable. The whole ‚Äúchildish/adolescent‚Äù thing you mentioned is more of a cultural thing, it‚Äôs common in Japan for girls to act a ton younger or childish, because of some...cutesy or innocence kink, I dunno man. Naturally, some VTubers mimic this, but I want to say the majority of the fans enjoy the hard work the girls put into their streams and entertainment they get out of it. It‚Äôs more of a comedy/impressive skills slant, rather than an ‚Äúomg waifu‚Äù take (though of course those exist too). 

Anyhow, it‚Äôs not to say you passing is wrong, you do you. If I learned anything from that sub and those talents, it‚Äôs to stay positive and spread that positivity if possible."

2021-05-13 11:57:39,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs pretty much people who use anime avatars (which I find it to be a pretty unique idea) with different personalities to stream games. Hololive does have a anime where the episodes are really short (and chaotic) but their animators work on it rather then the talents themselves.
2021-05-13 11:58:23,wallstreetbets,"1: They're less anime characters who stream, and more streamers that look like anime characters.


2: there's not really a storyline I don't think. But most streamers have a ""character"" that they play. Like Mori Calliope, a grim reaper who's taking a break from harvesting souls.


4: It's actually kind of a joke in the community how they mostly abandoned the ""idol"" thing, and just focused on streaming. (Especially Kiryu Coco)


5: It's actually fairly popular, with one streamer, Gawr Gura, having 2.66 million YouTube subscribers. And if the great Canadian vs American war was any indication, people are seriously committed to them."
2021-05-13 12:00:13,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôre streamers, mostly games, but they also do singing, art streams, movie watchalongs, sometimes talk show format games. They have a character that they play, but it‚Äôs mostly a joke. Like you know how Moist has lots of dildos or how Dunkey acts like a total idiot? Like that, but not quite so crude.

The person who does the character associated with the duck just puts on a high energy voice. There‚Äôs another character who‚Äôs supposed to be a rabbit girl and she says ‚Äúpeko‚Äù and has a really distinct laugh and runs a ‚Äúconstruction company‚Äù in their shared Minecraft server. There‚Äôs another character who is supposed to be a Phoenix and pretends to run a fast food chain.

All the ‚Äúgimmicks‚Äù are pretty much minor aspects just for continuity and goofs.

The company basically pays for character art, rigging, and then they also have setups for 3d streams where they do more traditional ‚Äúidol performances‚Äù. The company also does a lot of the business backend for licensing and dealing with rights for streaming and singing."

2021-05-13 11:54:58,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure initially hololive was meant to be just a fairly regular idol company but thanks to Covid they ended up turning into streamers and have become their own niche.
2021-05-13 11:53:10,wallstreetbets,"Yes. And it‚Äôs weird, but some people enjoy it and we get a cool dancing duck out of it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2021-05-13 12:04:09,wallstreetbets,"They all have a certain background and type of character to play but there storyline will generally change as they stream more and more to both match that person's chararistics and how they stream better as well as based on how they interact with the other streamers. There is also a mini anime of them they put up on the main channel for the hololive group with just 2 minute or so episode on YouTube that the streamers will voice over but nothing that happens in there really effects there streams (although they talk about it sometimes) it is just a little add on to the streams they all focus on and is just generally based on there characteristics.

They are mostly idols and act like it to the best of there abilities but obviously they are still just streamers so getting overexcited about games just comes naturally. Some are more idol like than others but they still have certain rules they all have to follow to some extent by there managers (since they are all work for a company it makes total sense to act like idols to keep there rep)

I don't about kids getting into this, probably mostly people who are already into anime which isn't limited to kids in any way, and there are a lot of people who clip parts of there streams and translate it into English for us which obviously can't be done by kids so there is definitely an adult audience (not saying there aren't kids of course, probably a fair amount).

I guess it is kind of a niche in the sense that there is a pretty clear line between loving it and hating it (the same as with anime) but just because it is a niche in that sense, it doesn't mean there is a small market, quite a few of them have over 1m subs on YouTube and 1 of them is even one of them is the top 5 most viewed female streamers with over 14 million views (Usada Pekora. 

And yeah they have there auditions to find who is the best for the spot and they train them to some extent over a certain period of time. They all start with a 2d model that just tracks the facial movements for most of the streams they do and some of them eventually get 3d models they use in vr where they will occasionally do singing and dancing on a stage. They also do quite a few karaoke streams in 2D to keep with there idol factor.

I hope that answers all your questions and then some lol, watch out for the rabbit hole my friend :)"
2021-05-13 12:04:15,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm part of the vtuber scene in that I make some of the models so to shed some light: 

Basically vtubers are virtual idols with movable avatars using software like live2d, or what was popular before using 3d models, and body tracking. Behind the avatar is a human who goes about the usual things a YouTuber or streamer does. 

As you mentioned, Hololive is one of the biggest virtual idol agency, with multi-lingual branches from Japanese, English, Chinese, Indonesian talents. The auditions are basically like America‚Äôs Top talent where you apply with your background experience and a video of you doing something that would catch the interest of the judges. Whether that‚Äôs singing, streaming funny content, drawing etc. 
Some agencies will have a theme for each generation of talents they release, so I guess there‚Äôs a bit of storyline but in general, it‚Äôs a human with an anime character avatar who streams and somewhat creates the personality of their character. 

I would say this kind of idol culture is definitely more prominent in the west than previous idol groups. It‚Äôs just more accessible for everyone- content for the audience and becoming an idol. I‚Äôve seen some of my friends make of career of being an indie vtuber or just working in the scene creating assets like models, rigging, managing other vtubers etc."
2021-05-13 12:21:02,wallstreetbets,"While there is something that is like an anime, that is something separate to what they usually do. They are all essentially streamers with anime character avatars.

Everyone has some backstory but there is no overarching storyline. That backstory is just a basis for their character that they follow to some degree. They usually just play around and have fun on stream to entertain viewers.

They don‚Äôt really make videos but some of them do shitpost random short videos from time to time. They usually stream games and have collabs with each other. They also may release covers of songs, originals, or do concerts.

They are meant to be ‚Äúidols‚Äù and actually do quite well in that respect, dancing, singing, and all that. But with how they act on stream, it‚Äôs a running joke that they‚Äôre all comedians rather than idols. I don‚Äôt know about sneaking idols though. They are trying to increase their influence overseas if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking. Most of the girls in Hololive are Japanese but there is an English and Indonesian generation.

Ah, I think it‚Äôs getting really popular now but I got into all of this a pretty long time ago and so I don‚Äôt really know how to gauge it‚Äôs popularity. There are many talents with over a million subscribers though.

Everyone gets old. Even I, someone pretty young feels old looking at what kids are into nowadays. But I guess I can‚Äôt say much looking at what things I‚Äôm into.

Yes Hololive has auditions (English 2nd gen is actually auditioning rn but I don‚Äôt know it that has ended yet). But 3D models usually come after they garner a certain amount of popularity and have been streaming for awhile. This isn‚Äôt concrete though there are probably other factors at play. It‚Äôs also something I‚Äôm guessing and not real information. And once they do get a 3D model, they can do 3D streams. Concerts aren‚Äôt that common though.

And all of which has been said was for Hololive. There are other companies like Nijisanji that also manage vtubers. There are also independent streamers.

Edit: I forgot I wanted to mention that Hololive has 5 generations, the English branch has just one, and the Indonesian branch has two. So there‚Äôs a lot of them and so they‚Äôre a wide variety of personalities from smug to calm to wholesome. They‚Äôre all cute in their own right though. There‚Äôs also a Holostars branch with theee generations featuring male vtubers, they‚Äôre also very fun to watch. All Japanese though but translator channels exist."
2021-05-13 12:27:37,wallstreetbets,"They're not sneaking up in the west, gura has the most followers of any member in hololive, and she's hololive English, while pekora was 4th most watched world wide"
2021-05-13 17:18:20,wallstreetbets,"There similar to streamers on twitch except instead of showing themselves, they use an avatar.

Each avatar has their own name and background, but how the ""actor"" decide to run with that character is up to them. It's a bit like wrestling's kayfabe, but there's no script to follow. 

They play games, sing songs, ASMR, draw, cook, do collabs and a wide variety of other stuff.

They are also idols, similar to akb48, and hold virtual concerts using 3d models of their character. 

The 3d models are occasionally used to create small skits, called hologra (hololive graffiti)."
2021-05-13 17:44:38,wallstreetbets,"You've been answered relatively comprehensively already, but as for ""instead of dancing on a stage"" - most if not all of them are actually professional singers and many have recorded music videos in Hololive's 3D recording suite. I'm not entirely sure if truly all of them have to be professional musicians at this point or if being a good streamer already potentially qualifies them because it's impossible to keep track of all of them at this point, they've hired so many. And I know basically nothing about the Chinese and Indonesian branch except for Kureiji Ollie. Just watch two or three handfuls of clips from streams and you'll have a solid impression of what it's all about. If you don't like subtitles, the English branch consists of:  
\- Gawr Gura  
\- Takanashi Kiara  
\- Mori Calliope  
\- Amelia Watson  
\- Ina  
I personally most like Gura as a singer (she did a really good cover of ""Big Iron"", for instance) and enjoy the sheer ridiculousness of Kiara's character kayfabe as essentially a lesbian sexfiend that can't help herself from doing the most normie / boomer-type meme to everyone... the rickroll. You can already see some deviation from the ""traditional"" Japanese idol-type character. The Hololive streamers are allowed to be funny. And if I can just say this as well: Generally, the person who's memed as ""best girl"" among Western viewers is Yagoo, the CEO, who advertised his company as an idol agency and basically got a bunch of people who violently defy that image. Like Matsuri, who among other things told her viewers about what is apparently Yagoo's favourite porn magazine."
2021-05-13 12:02:14,wallstreetbets,"Hololive is a virtual youtuber company that spawned out of Japan's idol culture. They only have 1 or 2 talent that are primarily ""Idols"" the rest are mostly youtuber/vloggers. 

Hololive is notable for be a company first hiring voice actors and making avatars, instead of just being a coalition of existing talent (like vShojo). 

As a company they have other teams besides just the talent themselves including a 3d anime,  stage shows with holograms, and a record label. 

It is not too popular in the west, and the vtubers that are native English tend to not be too idol-like.

Heck, vShojo (NOT part of Hololive, but a western vtuber group) is Project Melody. Who is a chatter bate star that got convinced to do twitch streams."

2021-05-13 16:44:46,wallstreetbets,"The ‚Äòcharacter‚Äô is made to keep the identity of the performer private. Sharing leaked private info on the talents is seen as taboo in fan communities.

-	I‚Äôm from Atlantis

-	I‚Äôm not old you guys! Im 17! It‚Äôs my birthday but I‚Äôm.. 17 season 2

It's still not truly an idol company, they're like variety entertainers. They all stream but some stream *much* more than others, most of them sing regularly but they have varying levels of competence, and they participate in concerts but again to varying degrees.

But they don't adhere to the traditional image of idols in that they have no problem swearing, talking to random guys (shocking!) eg. in Apex, basically acting like normal people. They used to be more prim and proper early on but certain members joined and broke the mold and management realised this was a draw card."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why the stock market is falling now. First the easy quarterly comparisons are gone.  It used to be pre covid numbers vs post covid numbers.  If you're in AMZN or ZM or SHOP.  You know what I mean  Its been a year.  They are gone.  The comparisons are tough now.

Second analysts estimates are catching up to reality.  The earnings beats used to be huge!  Jaw dropping really.  But now they are quite modest.  Still beats but just barely.

Trades are crowded and position sizes are all overweighted.  Today when earning are reported, beats don't move the stocks the way that they used to.  Why?  Because not only does everyone already own the stock, (no one left to buy it) they own way more of it than they should.  Why? Because 1/2 the world was shut down by covid.  The viable trades that remained became very crowded and over owned.  Portfolio managers seeing difficult comparisons and modest earnings beats now are selling into strength to reduce exposure to over owned overexposed positions.  Saas stocks and home shopping stocks are great examples.  Terrific earnings terrible charts.

Recovery stocks ran up BIG BIG BIG.  But now as earnings are being reported we see that absolutely nothing is going on anywhere in recovery names.  Hotels, airlines, Casinos.  Zip zip zip.  Nothing to see here folks move along.  This certainly stifled new buys maybe even induced some selling.

Where is the money going?  Right now it looks like the money pulled is being parked in some select REITs and Utility stocks for brief periods.  From there it is being scattered broadly into recovery names vertically.  So if you like airlines as a recovery theme.  You buy engine makers.  Parts suppliers.  ect all the way through the supply chains.  You are trying to avoid crowded trades and seek value buys in soon to be recovering industries. 

This is a transition.  The recovery has not been canceled.  Stock picking still matters."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Bullish and bearish cases for American airline stocks Hi guys,

This is a deep dive into the bullish and bearish cases for American airline stocks.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2021/05/13/delta-american-airlines-stocks-are-a-trap](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2021/05/13/delta-american-airlines-stocks-are-a-trap)

**TLDR:**

>""So to justify their prices and keep up with the market, airline stocks have to a) get out of the hole and bring back earnings to where they were, or b) in some way investors have to make peace with much higher valuations.""

**Bearish arguments:**

* The most lucrative customers won‚Äôt come back soon, if at all
* Airlines will spend the next 5 years paying down a mountain of debt

**Bullish arguments:**

* Pent-up wanderlust will boost leisure travel and fares
* Covid will knock out competition for American airlines (parallels with post-9/11 period)
* Speculative, ‚Äúbulk investing‚Äù will hold airlines‚Äô valuations higher

**The most promising sub-sector:** airlines that live off domestic and leisure travel like Alaska Airlines (ALK)

**Bottom line:** gains from mainstream airlines probably won‚Äôt outweigh the opportunity cost of sinking the money into an industry that‚Äôs run up so far ahead of itself."
2021-05-13 10:00:57,wallstreetbets,I still hate flying on AA; that‚Äôs my bear case.
2021-05-13 10:10:42,wallstreetbets,This is like saying that the market will be red or green tomorrow
2021-05-13 09:02:16,wallstreetbets,"""The most lucrative customers won‚Äôt come back soon, if at all""

This is very likely. Businesses are accustomed to Zoom calls. While face-to-face meetings still have their advantages, I can't see businesses returning to the pre-pandemic level of travel anytime soon, if ever. Those are the people that pay full fare and often for first/business class seats."
2021-05-13 09:09:51,wallstreetbets,"American Airlines will resume on Thursday the normal schedule of two long-haul flights out of its Charlotte, North Carolina, hub that were impacted by the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline, a spokesman said on Wednesday.
American has reallocated resources to resume non-stop service on the two flights therefore AAL is doing great for me on those upward climbs last month. Buy and hold the pre pandemic levels catch ups"
2021-05-13 09:45:51,wallstreetbets,Its simple there is no thinking planes on ground rn after openings and post covid planes fly. Simple Math buy the stock like the stock eat the dip with your chips.
2021-05-13 09:56:43,wallstreetbets,"I personally invest in rocket ships, not airplanes"
2021-05-13 11:26:17,wallstreetbets,I looked into the european market a couple of months ago and couldnt justify stock prices against the missing turnover. I think most airlines stocks are way to high. If traveling picks up somehow then there is still the massive debt that needs to be paid. I decided to stay away from this sector.
2021-05-13 11:58:22,wallstreetbets,Paying down debt gets a lot easier with hyperinflation.
2021-05-13 09:34:29,wallstreetbets,"Umm I doubt this. Too many businesses rely on face to face selling. Unfortunately as good as zoom/teams/webex is, there is still a human element to selling that a virtual meeting does not do or can accomplish. There's a big difference in getting a deal done or even talking specifics with a person in real time then through virtual.

I can tell you from a chemical industry perspective, people are anxious to be able to get back on the road. 

You might see a slight decline but not an insane drop."
2021-05-13 10:22:23,wallstreetbets,"As u/TopAnalyst stated business travel is where they generate their highest profit margin and some of it is lost for a very long time, if not forever. They don't have to lose much for it to cost them A LOT."
2021-05-13 09:38:15,wallstreetbets,"The argument is not that corportate travel won't come back. It's that it will see a drop or lag, which will affect earnings (especially considering it's the highest margin segment)"
2021-05-13 11:32:33,wallstreetbets,This is correct.
2021-05-13 10:49:36,wallstreetbets,"Oh if you're trying to play earnings on the airlines, I'd toss that out the window. Especially short term. The only saving grace short term they have is the government will never allow them to collapse.

Major global shortages on everything you can think of is currently happening (not just semiconductors, gas, or steel; just basic raws) = no production = no further development = no travel needed.

Once raw shortages come back to norm, you'll see a uptick in travel as companies go back into full production, development resumes, and component products are needed more then ever."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why would a bank enter in a Reverse REPO with the FED at 0% when the Interest On Excess Reserves is at 0.10%? You can see [here](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&startDate=01/01/2000&enddate=01/01/2000)  the REPO and Reverse REPO operations done with the FED. From the FED  point of view, in a REPO, they lend money to a counterparty that gives a  Bond as guarantee, in a Reverse REPO, the FED borrows liquidity from a  counterparty in exchange for a Bond. For example, yesterday, 39  counterparties lent to the FED 209 Billions at 0%.

As you can see in the link, there are counterparties that lend to the FED at 0%. But why would they do that when the [Interest On Excess Reserves](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reqresbalances.htm)  is positive at 0.10%? Couldn't they just park the cash as reserves held  by the FED gaining 0.10% instead of lending to the FED at 0%? Am I  missing something?"
2021-05-13 09:04:59,wallstreetbets,So that they can get the bonds and short it.
2021-05-13 09:28:54,wallstreetbets,"Overnight repo has gone negative recently, so some firms (who are eligible) want to lock in the 0% for overnight lending instead of going to the others in the market and potentially get charged. Only banks have reserve accounts at the Fed, thus only them, can get paid IOER since only banks have access to Fed reserves. 

If you have spare cash and want to adjust your holdings to hold less cash and more of other highly-liquid stuff like Treasuries (like money market funds) you head to the repo market. Normally you'd get paid but since banks, hedge funds don't need this extra cash (they are sitting on trillions of excess reserves and turning away deposits), you're left with fewer options. The best is 0%.

  
This is also why the Fed is expected to raise the reverse repo rate so it wouldn't fall before 0 like it has in April.

2021-05-13 10:54:23,wallstreetbets,"So they sell the bonds now, and then they buy back the bonds later to collect the initial collateral back from the FED?"
2021-05-13 12:38:12,wallstreetbets,"Yep, spread between repo rate and risk free rate is the same thing as a borrow fee. When repo rates are lower than risk free rate, that means the asset is hard to borrow because it has heavy short interest."
2021-05-13 09:50:07,wallstreetbets,"Clear thanks! So basically, lenders in a Reverse Repo are, for example, money market funds that are not eligible to get the Interest On Excess Reserves.

However, why wouldn't a bank want additional liquidity since it gets 0.10% on the excess reserves? So a bank could borrow from a money market fund at, let's say, 0.01% (higher than FED Reverse Repo Rate) and park this cash as reserves held by the FED, getting basically 0.09% for free.

The same reasoning could be applied to the Effective Fed Funds Rate, which is currently 0.06%, so a bank could borrow at 0.06% from, for example, a Government Sponsored Enterprise, and get 0.10% on this cash parked as excess reserves.

Why do this arbitrage exists? Or am I missing something?"
2021-05-13 10:58:09,wallstreetbets,So do we live in limbo until the FOMC meeting in June to find out if rates are raising or would this be announced outside of the FOMC meeting?
2021-05-13 10:35:49,wallstreetbets,"Cash is not the same thing as reserves. Banks need to hold reserves to back up any deposits that they are liable to meet withdrawals for, thus any short-term and accessible checking accounts + since recently savings account (which is why M1 shot up but M2 only moderately increased).

Since banks aren't doing that much lending, those extra reserves, that would otherwise have gone to required reserves if banks had lent out money, are piling up since they can just get free positive interest. The cash a bank would get from another participant is not Fed reserves, thus they cannot earn IOER on it.

Remember, reserves constitute base money (+ coins and paper) and only banks have access to them and trade them among each other in the Fed funds market. This is what the Fed targets when you hear they are ""setting rates at x%"", which is the rate at which banks borrow reserves from each other. They try to make reserves as scarce or abundant as needed so banks would borrow from each other at within this band. If IOER > IOR, then banks that hold more reserves don't have an incentive to lend out excess reserves if the rate they're getting adjusted credit risk of the marginal loan is less than IOER since they wouldn't lend reserves to other banks. This gets complicated with you and I paying each other with cash and the banks have to settle daily transactions with reserves, that's why this market is always active (if I pay you, what actually happens is my bank loses a deposit and your bank gains a deposit > your bank needs to have reserves to back this deposit etc).

Since everyone is flush with cash, which doesn't earn interest, the relative price of holding cash has been dropping towards, and intermittently through, 0."
2021-05-13 11:34:15,wallstreetbets,"It's gonna be June, and the the repo rate (SOFR) won't go up by huge margins. They want to create a floor at 0 for overnight secured lending, not tighten policy by like 25 or 50 bp for overnight unsecured reserves that people seem to think. 

Recall that the depth of the disinflation last year was May and June , so inflation will rise (probably above 4% YoY) for both May and June this year, so as those drop out out annual calculations we'd get a clearer picture of what they regard as transitory and their eagerness to raise rates/wind down QE. 

The important thing is to remember that last year was bad, and we're just making up for lost grounds."
2021-05-13 15:43:28,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the explanation! I mistakenly thought that if a bank had excess cash of any kind (therefore also coming from a Repo transaction), this cash could have been parked reserve by the FED.

But then how a bank builds up excess reserves? From your answer, I think this would happen just if a bank has a lot of withdrawals and therefore it would need less reserves by the FED, and the additional, not-needed-anymore reserves would be excess reserves. Is this correct? Are there also other ways to build up excess reserves?

Also, regarding your comment to gcline33, if you say in June the FED will probably increase Repo rate, should we expect that the front part of the yield curve will increase? Because if the Repo rate becomes, let's say, 0.10%, who would want to hold a 154-day bill that yields 0.09%, and keep the cash parked for 6 months when it's possible to roll over overnight at 0.10%?

I am not wed to opinions of economic activity or inflation and how they may steer markets. I am  not self-proclaimed bulls or bears. 

 Quite often, investors are rewarded for going against the crowd, especially when the masses are in agreement on what the future holds. 

 Despite  extraordinary circumstances, the level of confidence in economic and market forecasts is remarkably high. Many ‚Äúexperts‚Äù forecast beautiful days with a temporary bout of above-average inflation. There is nary a mention of the potential for debilitating inflation and almost no recognition of the troubling deflationary hurricane off at sea. 

 **The confidence and hubris backing forecasts should be of great concern, not comfort.** 

The Butterfly Effect

In 1963, Edward Lorenz, a meteorology professor from MIT, wrote a white paper called *Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow*. 

Per the essence of his work is that ‚Äú***small¬† changes can have large consequences****.*‚Äù His logic is better known as the Butterfly Effect.

  *‚ÄúLorenz suggested that the flap of a butterfly‚Äôs wings might ultimately cause a tornado. And the butterfly effect, also known as ‚Äúsensitive dependence on initial conditions,‚Äù has a profound corollary:* ***forecasting the future can be nearly impossible****.‚Äù* 

 *‚ÄúYet Lorenz‚Äôs own deterministic equations demonstrated how easily the dream of perfect knowledge founders in reality.* ***That the tiny change in his simulation mattered so much showed, by extension, that the imprecision inherent in any human measurement could become magnified into wildly incorrect forecasts.‚Äù*** 

The Fed has charged the investment atmosphere. Today‚Äôs investors view markets as get rich quick schemes. Stories of investors turning thousands into hundreds of thousands litter social media. The problem is that such behavior is not natural nor sustainable. It relies on ever-growing amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus, which are not sustainable.

 Why is this? Significant consideration must be excessive monetary policy and how it reduces the level of perceived risk. Investors are blinded as the Fed has more than doubled the money supply in less than a year. The result is massive amounts of liquidity infiltrating the asset markets. Further, investors, rightly or wrongly, firmly believe the Fed will do whatever it takes to prop up ailing markets. 

There is another vital aspect. Capitalism provides better living standards for more people when it is most efficiently run. A core component of capitalism is how productively capital is used.¬† **Ask yourself, is capital being deployed most productively?**

The casino may stay open for a while longer, so enjoy it while it lasts. Make no mistake, the doors will close, and gamblers will be trapped.

 *Bulls win in Bull Markets; Bears win in Bear Markets. Eagles soar above and take advantage of opportunity.  

I am Neither Bull nor Bear abt stocks , bonds, currencies . Actually since I stop fighting with Fed and surrounded and bought Physcial silver just to protect my fortune .*

This time is not different!

Now every day that goes by another part of the country opens up so people want to spend money on frivolous shit after being locked up for a year (yes I'm being hyperbolic but the sentiment stands) all the while we haven't ramped up production to meet those needs.  So yeah inflation will go up in the short term since obviously wages arent going up.  

There's all kinds of reasons to agree or disagree with the feds assessment until we learn what the truth is I'm just going to keep rolling with TLT puts until the fed says something about raising rates.  Its free money at this point."

Even though they will ""protect"" your fortune during downturns, stocks outperform them by far over the long haul. Precious metals also have downturns of their own. Most investments can appear ""safe"" when you cherry-pick from their historical performance.  


Take Dow vs. gold over the past century, for example. The comparison between the two can vary wildly if you compare specific 5- or 10-year periods, but overall, stocks are still the better way to protect your wealth over time.

2021-05-13 10:40:53,wallstreetbets,"In my humble opinion what's happening with tilray being over sold with news that people don't quite understand. I been following aphria since last year because I owned some shares. The reason why I bought aphria last year was because I looked at it's balance sheet like i do with any other company ( I almost finished my accounting degree a few years back). I found that it had a very healthy and strong balance sheet. You always have to look at the company balance sheet so you can see how it's doing in the present and how it was doing a few years back. The reason why is because you need to compare how the ceo and management are managing the company. From what I saw from the balance sheet was that the ceo Irwin simon and his managers were doing a fantastic job because they had alot of cash in the bank from sales and operations compare to other cannabis companies including tilray. Aphria had alot of cash to simply buy Sweetwater from the u.s on November 2020 to have a foot in the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana. Tilray on the other hand is trying to get into other countries for it's medical marijuana and got a great deal when they gave tilray the permission to distribute it's medical marijuana in the united Kingdom on February 2021. Tilray has more countries to distribute it's medical marijuana and it also bought Manitoba Harvest to also have a foot into the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana, it's easy to look up this information. But germany and Canada are the biggest market for both aphria and tilray. The reason why am naming this two countries is because ladies and gentleman this two countries have been in lockdowns and so have other European nations in these past months. What the hell does that matter some may say, well if these countries went into lockdowns how can aphria and tilray make money. That's the reason why thier sales went down by alot this past quarter because they had no control over these lockdowns. You can check how much money aphria and tilray made in sales in 2020 and compare. Once these lockdowns have been lifted they will again start to make what they have been making. Aphria and tilray weren't named the biggest company based on sales for no reason. They will clearly be one of the leaders in the cannabis industry. I really can't understand how Canopy is valued at $40 while the new tilray is trading below $15 , which to me is dirt cheap. Tilray just reported out it's first quarter but people have to understand that they just reported the old tilray sales and not the new tilray ( aphria and tilray). As these lockdowns have been lifted and Europe is starting to open and the ceo Irwin simons and his managers start to manage the new tilray I see the company price jumping up close to where these past analyst are putting thier fair value price targets easily. I am in no means a financial advisor or an expert. Am just an informed trader and all the information I just gave can be easily looked up online. People have to get informed before making trades so please trade at your own risk and always verify any information you look up online."

The only way to get out of this situation is to keep printing even more or stop escape from dollar by backing it up with gold. The loss of purchasing power will be progressing until USD lose completely status of world reserve currency.

Before USD becomes exchangable for gold ,  price will be revalued seriously.

Transitory inflation you say?

Its not prices going up, but purchasing power of currency going down. Once central bank starts massive printing it cannot stop as more money is needed to serve increasing debt.

The solution is either to keep printing more or stop eventual outflow from USD by backing it up with Gold. its price must be enough to serve current debt by available physical stock i.e 8000 tones in Fort Knox which has never been audited.

I believe Big Banks will find a way , most likely another ponzi schema to navigate out of situation and distract apes with another digital asset with no intrinsic value.

Silver and Gold are just a weird legacy play though because they aren't as essential as other commodities and people get tied to them because they have historical value.   Copper would be an example of a high demand asset but the problem is investing in physical copper is a lot harder because it takes up too much space so it is harder to sell to panic stricken boomers."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why potential inflation could lead to a financial crisis? **A bit of history**

The decade of the 2000s may have been a pretty good decade in many aspects, movies such as the lord of the rings or harry potter were released; music albums such as The Strokes' ""Is this It"" or Bob Dylan's ""Modern Times"" were released. Nevertheless, this decade was not a good one in economic terms. This decade started with the dotcom crash, which was triggered by the rise and fall of technology stocks. And, this was not the only remarkable economic event of this decade, when the economy seemed to have recovered from this crisis, another crisis broke out, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, triggered by the collapse of the housing market in the U.S. All these economic turbulences can be clearly seen in the evolution of the S&P500 between 2000 and 2010 as shown in Figure 1.

[Figure 1. S&P500 \(2000 -2010\)](https://preview.redd.it/6g7jwgdjnuy61.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=cddf64cd6bce2330521f414c2533359a5ca76ac8)

**A time of low interest rates**

Moreover, these economic disturbances led governments to act severely. Keynesian policies for the activation of the economy began to play a fundamental role. To encourage consumption, interest rates were lowered to near historic lows. Figure 2 displays the US 10 year note bond yield between 1920 and 2020. In this figure, we can see how the dotcom crash pushed down this yield. However, after that it started recovering until July 2007, when the financial crisis started, after that, that yield continued a downward trend.

[Figure 2. US 10 Year Note Bond Yield](https://preview.redd.it/p7mnvg3gduy61.png?width=746&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbd8e007d5d740cf3bd371bc53dba2a8a59df93d)

**Stocks as the only attractive investment vehicle**

Such a long period of low interest rates inflated stock prices. Figure 3, shows how cyclically adjusted S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio has been rising during the last decade, being quite high in comparison to other periods of time (specially before the dot-com bubble). Stock prices started trading at a premium, because there were no attractive alternative investments, this channelled much of the liquidity into equities (bonds with almost no interest or even negative interests were not an attractive investment anymore). Hence, low interest rates justify high stock prices, since stocks are highly attractive relative to bonds.

[Figure 3: Cyclically adjusted S&P 500 price-to-earnings rations](https://preview.redd.it/9al89cizwuy61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a21d3c6b829fdb2c9427c653a7da1421bfb274)

**An unexpected event: A global pandemic**

2020 was not a good year, this year will always be remembered as the year of the COVID. COVID brought many changes in our lives, which undoubtedly had an impact on the economy.    As a result, governments continued to pursue stimulative policies and interest rates remained at very low levels. 

One of the best illustrations of those stimulative policies is the amount of dollars printed in 2020: 21% of the United States dollar was printed in 2020, as shown in Figure 4. This large injection was used for both direct and indirect assistance in the COVID situation. This, at the same time, indirectly channelled part of this aid to the financial markets, increasing their value.

[Figure 4. Annual Money Stock Growth \(Trillions of USD\)](https://preview.redd.it/l0c36b3gzuy61.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf093aa9e839d942d3f65b3a9f875b37858e060c)

**A  double-edged sword**

Injecting money to the economy is always something controversial. Through the law of supply and demand it is easy to infer that a considerable increase in supply (without a similar increase in demand) will reduce the price of a good.  In money, when this happens, we say that the money loses value, i.e. one monetary unit can acquire fewer products. In other words, this is what we call inflation. Even Warren Buffet has shown concern for inflation in the past month:

> ""**We are seeing very substantial inflation \[...\] We are raising prices. People are raising prices to us and it‚Äôs being accepted.‚Äù** 

This raise on prices can be  already tracked on several indices such as Bloomberg's agriculture index, shown in Figure 5 and also in the annual single-family home price, as shown in Figure 6.

&#x200B;

[Figure 5. Bloomberg agriculture index](https://preview.redd.it/ad6oocg86vy61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=145f863fb092b97f061d7cff98b2b3361a519ac9)

[Figure 6. Annual Single-family home price \(extracted from: https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-05-11\/u-s-home-prices-surge-the-most-on-record-in-buying-frenzy?sref=RJ2RlMrh\)](https://preview.redd.it/5oc8mgum6vy61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=558de3a89d40db8d9c9a511318ebb4e9178ebbdc)

The appearance of inflation means that interest rates should rise. Something that was already pointed by Janet Yellen at the start of this month:

> **‚ÄúIt may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn‚Äôt overheat‚Äù** 

But what would happen if inflation persists and interest rates have to be risen? Remember that I previously said that stocks are trading at a premium due to the lack of attractive alternative investments. This would no longer be true and this premium would no longer be a thing. And, thus, we should expect a decrease in the stock price.

**The market can not be timed**

Even with all these indicators, it is difficult to say whether this will happen in the short to medium term. There are many factors which could deter inflation away and interest rates low. As an example, Berkshire Hathaway has been stacking cash during the last years, as shown in Figure 7, playing a slightly more defensive position. This may be due the fact that they already saw that low interest rates during the last decade were driving the stock market at high prices. However, interest rates are still low and during that time the stock market has continued rising.

[Figure 7. Berkshire's Cash Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/3ag5lqt6cvy61.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=f91b8be62cb599332c4c1404ef878e6dcf6529a3)

**Summary**

* The first decade of the 2000s was characterized by two economic crisis, which defined an economy with very low interest rates 
* Low interest rates increased stock market prices, since there were no attractive alternative investments and, thus, stock markets traded at a premium.
* The Covid crisis led to a massive injection of money into the economy. 
* This money injection is a double-edged sword which may have brought an exuberance illusion awakening a ghost that has been dormant in recent years, inflation.
* The emergence of inflation would imply an increase in interest rates.
* An increase in interest rates would mean that the premium paid for stocks would be lost.
* Despite all these facts, timing the market is no easy task. And thus, other factors could keep inflation away and interest rates away, prolonging this situation."

2021-05-13 07:38:58,wallstreetbets,"The presumption that interest rates will rise because of inflation may not prove out. The massive debt the fed gov is carrying can only be sustained by low interest rates. Higher rates mean more of our tax $ go to paying the fed deficit. In turn, less fed spending on useful programs and the need to cutbacks or higher taxes. The result leaves most of us to less general spending which slows the economic engine and the cycle repeats."

2021-05-13 15:02:54,wallstreetbets,"One of the biggest misunderstood factors is globalization: as capitalists seek the lower cost of production, they go oversea. Yes, blocking China might work temporarily, same as the Covid induced trade reduction. But they just move their productions to other countries like Viet, India, Mexico etc. before they ever come back to the US and Europe. So the lower-cost competition will always pull back the inflation as the western higher cost workers can't just compete.  

I see the current inflation is transitory and unless something more fundamental happens (such as war,  3D prints, AI etc.), this low rate environment (or low inflation) will be for a while, a long while."

I think of money as secondary in this chain. When the demand rises, production will increase. We are at the point of maximum production on a lot of goods and services even despite covid. If demands will still increase only the prices can go up because it is no longer possible to provide and increase production. You see this happening with prices of raw materials already (think about copper and iron). Only a slight increase in interest will send stock prices to fall because of the large debts. We saw that happening a couple of months ago (good i was invested in some financial stock and made a nice profit üòâ) a further increase will start a chain reaction. Production capacity will be deinvested, bankruptcy starts and a new balancepoint between supply and demand will be found hence an economic crisis. I personally think this is a very real thing on the short term. Recovering covid could postpone it because sectors that got hit will have some ups the coming time. Nice post! I was thinking about this for a while since my company has problems with raw materials. Same thing that‚Äôs happend before last crises hit us."

Thomas Piketty honed in on this in his book ‚ÄòCapital in the 21st Century‚Äô. The concentration of wealth in an increasingly small minority.   
The next factor which makes this worse is how the wealthy avoid fair taxation. As Rutger Bregman famously said at Davos in 2019  'It feels like I'm at a firefighters conference and no one's allowed to speak about water.  
The least appreciated mechanism by which the rich got so obscenely rich in America is naked short selling (of shares AND other securities) creating trillions of synthetic securities diluting the real stuff, and transferring the balance to the 1%.   
This film explains it so well and it has been going on for decades.

* Keeping it all cash isn't an option: inflation will eat it away.
* Buying stocks isn't an option: most if not all are overpriced or will be influenced by the rest of the market tanking. Even ""safe/boomer"" ETFs like $VOO, $VTI, etc are bound to crash (like they did in the dotcom bubble and the subprime mortgage crises).
* Buying bonds isn't an option neither because every rate hike will make your bonds' yield crash and force you to keep them until maturity. And right now bonds are paying super-low interest.

Once the public loses confidence in the stock market... and that's likely when the system breaks down. So he's betting that only the stock market will crash, but the monetary system will stay. That money he has is losing value, so he has to think about the impact of inflation. 

Then there is the second scenario. If the stock market crash AND the monetary system break down, his money is worthless. He's not ready for this since he is not into gold. 

I hate Buffett, but I think the more likely scenario is that the stock market crash at some point this year."

2021-05-13 09:54:50,wallstreetbets,"What people don't realize is that a lot of the money ""injected"" was replacing wages earned so people could survive. It's not like the people were earning wages AND receiving stimulus/unemployment cheques. There was obviously a small percentage that were able to scam the system and receive both, but for the most part you were either:

1) Too wealthy and did not receive unemployment OR stimulus.

2) Middle class that received stimulus, but continued to work (no unemployment).

3) Middle class that received stimulus and also got laid off, so received unemployment.

4) Lower class that received stimuuls and received unemployment due to being jobless.

&#x200B;

In almost all scenarios people were using the stimulus money to survive and pay rent. So the question we should ask is how much of the ""free"" money was actually a surplus, thus will contribute to inflation.

&#x200B;

Example, John earns $1,000 a month at his job and spend roughly $900/month on living expenses and surviving. All of a sudden John is laid off and received 2x $1,200 stimulus cheques over the period of one year for an average of $200 a month. He also receives $900 a month in unemployment benefits. His surplus from ""free"" money is only $100 because he is still spending $1,000 on living expenses. He still has a mortgage to pay, car payments, and needs to buy food, just as he \*normally\* would if he had a job.

A lot of people are seeing $2,400 in helicopter money + unemployment when the reality is that there isn't much surplus UNLESS you are gaming the system."

2021-05-13 11:37:57,wallstreetbets,"Diversifying your exposure to more than just stocks and bonds is a wise decision. People mention a commodities supercycle but I think this is temporary supply chain issue that's distorting the inflationary picture. It could be the dreaded stagflation brewing, but quite frankly this market logjam persists because of the eviction moratorium combined with the spike in unemployment.   
I get why it was done, but this is the bed the government decided to make. Trump pulled the trigger on these policies but most people cheered him on when he did so. Now, because a lot of people who could afford to do so fled the cities, you have consequences were there's a massive labor shortage in some parts of the country (literally \*every\* business around me is hiring, and you could count on one hand the places to rent or purchase within an hour of where I live). Other parts of the country are crumbling because the trickle-down ecosystem they lived in has completely fallen apart (in some cases, thanks to overreaction in shutting things down). So big businesses have some attractiveness simply because they're the only game able to stay open.  
Finally, rising prices on asset classes elsewhere might simply be people placing their bets. If you paid close enough attention, we saw SPY and QQQ puts get bought heavily back in February when we had our first market scare, and again in March. Maybe this was to hedge and lock in long-term gains (which is another issue people are ignoring), but it could be that something is about to give."

2021-05-13 13:05:30,wallstreetbets,One of the worst.  But the late 70's through early 80's were worse.

2021-05-13 13:54:11,wallstreetbets,"No, all that money goes to assets. Fed doesn't care about the poor being priced out of assets.  They care about them being able to consume that's why the measure is the Consumer Price Index.  

They realised technology would bring down consumer prices and better the lives of the poor instead of asset holders.  So they acted by pinning the price of goods at a steady 2%.  This way asset holder got to reap all the benefits of technology led deflation.

Simply quit using there currency."
2021-05-13 16:51:56,wallstreetbets,Its from manufacturing facilities laying off lots of empoyees due to COVID. Supply capacities were devastated. Now they are a) struggling to get employees back and b) in no huge rush to get them back because of higher profit margins.
2021-05-13 16:58:47,wallstreetbets,"Based off the comment, you believe the inflation is caused by demand but I am saying the supply chain is screwing it up. Lumber for example had reduced output due to covid restrictions and it is slowly coming back as workplace restrictions ease. Meanwhile everyone decided to start a home renovation too.

As for meat especially pork, a year ago farmers couldn‚Äôt give away their pigs and so many reduced their head counts and now demand is coming back but supply takes longer to come back. 

With the chips, new plants are being built but they take time. All these items are transitory and once supply ramps up again, inflation will temper down."

Potentially millions of properties not being listed because of delinquent tenants will hit the market once moratorium is lifted. They‚Äôll ask a greedy fortune for them but only a few will have any luck, at which time the market momentum swings back towards the buyers (a little.)"
2021-05-13 10:50:30,wallstreetbets,"False. There will not be enough supply when that happens to lower prices. In my market at least we are already seeing foreclosures pop up. However it's only the ones that had been in the works for 5-10 years anyways. Most foreclosures do not have a fast turn around. Time from actual foreclosure to listed for sale can take YEARS! Those foreclosures may not be financiable. The ones that are will sell for market value regardless if it's owned by a bank or person. I expect to see thing calm down a bit. Instead of competing against 10-20 other buyers maybe it will slow down to 3-5 other buyers, but prices are not going to reverse the growth will just slow. In March we saw prices jump 20% in 4 weeks! That's not sustainable, but that doesn't mean we'll start to see it drop. I'm hoping/expecting our local market to slow to a 3-5% growth over 4-8 weeks and even that is still high when ""normal"" is 3-6% year over year."

People are more ""diamond hands"" with real estate than they are with stocks.  Way more.  No one sells at a loss unless you're forced to.

This whole post was about inflation.  That implies they won't be forced to at all.  What they bought yesterday (real estate) will be worth more tomorrow, even if they overpaid yesterday."
2021-05-13 09:22:26,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell low. This also applies to real estate."
2021-05-13 10:55:34,wallstreetbets,"If the interest rate is lower than the payment could be the same. So why sell on the dip? Plus, primary residential purchases are usually for the long term. The general rule of thumb was 7 years before it was worth it to sell, now it more like 7 weeks..... people have to pay to live somewhere might as well be paying into a property you own vs rent."
2021-05-13 15:08:37,wallstreetbets,Hahaha guess so
2021-05-13 17:16:08,wallstreetbets,That was cold.
2021-05-13 09:48:48,wallstreetbets,"Yes. It is the indiscriminate, naked, cyclic shorting which is bringing the stock market to this level. See for example, ""BE"" was attempted to be shorted to 18 in the middle of the night of May 12-13. Countless stocks are going thru this kind of shorting... From Feb 6th levels, many stocks are down more than 50 to 60%. Just due to shorting... Their idea is to short it, drive price down, induce panic, make weaklings sell, this creating na environment for the shorts to rebuy cheap. They are making money with zero investment.

Covered calls are perfectly fine... You are writing a call with shares to back you if the call is assigned."

2021-05-13 13:59:13,wallstreetbets,interest rates go up = bonds go down = yield go up.
2021-05-13 19:38:46,wallstreetbets,Probably value stocks that make money today rather than growth stocks projected to make devalued future money.

2021-05-13 12:00:05,wallstreetbets,"That's pretty much what I decided too, so I'm trying to buy still.  Now if I could just find a 4plex that doesn't get bought for cash, I'll take it. The only thing better about buying when rates are high and pricing is lower is that you could refi if rates eventually came back down. You can't refi out of a high purchase price."
2021-05-13 13:09:37,wallstreetbets,You gain the flexibility of being able to sell and not owing more than the property is worth. Nothing like being upside down with nowhere to go but bankruptcy or riding it out.
2021-05-13 15:44:12,wallstreetbets,"You gain a cooler housing market. I‚Äôm not that concerned with prices at the moment. What I AM concerned with is having a bidding war with multiple cash buyers and having to settle for 40-50k over asking price to even be considered. 
I‚Äôll take the higher interest loan and refinance later on."
2021-05-13 18:01:15,wallstreetbets,">nterest rates go up. You ain't gaining anything by waiting. Even worse is if rates go up and housing prices don't while rents go up also.

Exactly this! Even more so if you are a first time buyer since you keep losing money on rent payments."
2021-05-13 11:06:03,wallstreetbets,"The problem is stocks are a bit overvalued, but housing is relatively scarce and undervalued being directly impacted by rising cost of material. 

So if you were able to get an investment property/rental, and have a tenant pay off your interest and property tax, even if you have to contribute principal, you‚Äôre still out on top because your interest is lower than the rate of inflation, while inflation jacks up the value of your property."
2021-05-13 16:45:52,wallstreetbets,What about REIT stocks? Will they do well during inflationary periods?
2021-05-13 18:42:25,wallstreetbets,In Canada its more like cad $450 per sq ft.  Absolutely fucked here.  Raise rates already.
2021-05-13 13:48:03,wallstreetbets,Which is why they won't hike rates and let inflation run hot for years.  They already changed to justifying it to the masses because women and POC employment isn't where they would like.  Like Powell gives a fuck about minorities.
2021-05-13 18:52:23,wallstreetbets,"And a LOT of that isn‚Äôt going to roll back, it‚Äôs being straight up burned."
2021-05-13 13:49:16,wallstreetbets,Yes but if you wait watch your money get inflated away.  This is why the entire market moves on Powell's words alone.
2021-05-13 13:39:14,wallstreetbets,"From what I have seen, much of this current inflation is supply chain issues where demand is outpacing supply due to covid shutdowns and a fast economic recovery

The next year is going to be rough, but businesses will want to capitalize on this new demand and produce more, so next year once production is ramped up then inflation should slow"
2021-05-13 19:35:48,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, there is no sign that Biden will quit spending like he has a blank check and anyone who thinks it won't have an impact is keeping their head in the sand.

I'm truly worried about this. The fed used it's power to prop up the economy when it really didn't need to and now that we have a real problem they can't turn to the typical tools. We needed inflation to stick to the stock market but recent reports show general goods are now being affected as well. Not good"
2021-05-13 10:54:36,wallstreetbets,"It's fucked. No matter how you slice it.

2021-05-13 10:58:50,wallstreetbets,"Last I checked, might be out of date. US pays $280 billion a year just to service our debt.

2021-05-13 13:03:36,wallstreetbets,I know of CD's but never used them before.  Don't the interest payments stay in the CD until the term is up?  Can you really take it out as liquid cash on a yearly/quarterly basis?
2021-05-13 13:10:35,wallstreetbets,Timing is everything.
2021-05-13 13:53:23,wallstreetbets,True but hardly decade defining

2021-05-13 11:02:11,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but the difference is inflation is hotter than they let on, and they will let it run continually. It's a massive smash and grab from the private sector to the public sector. Worse though is that the impact will be disproportionately felt, this means holders of debt will benefit while workers and non property owners will be even more disenfranchised. Hence the yellow jacket protests."

2021-05-13 17:18:11,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt know what to tell you if you don‚Äôt think the US printing 20% of the money in all circulation ever in one year has any consequences.
2021-05-13 09:27:52,wallstreetbets,"I think you misunderstood. I did not say it had anything to do with inflation, just that the best time to buy had passed   üòé"
2021-05-13 09:09:14,wallstreetbets,A teetering financial crisis and you don't expect a job recession coming with that?
2021-05-13 09:44:43,wallstreetbets,"Also there are varying degrees of underwater when it comes to homes. If rents are still on par with your underwater mortgage, it may still be worth it to keep the mortgage since you'll still have some sort of asset. *Most* metros aren't exactly seeing 20-30% over asking on 500k+ homes. I dunno, I think there's an abundance of reasons to want to keep a home even through a supposed real estate crash."
2021-05-13 10:19:45,wallstreetbets,This is stupid. The whole point of the stock market is price discovery. If people are panic selling when the price of something goes down it means it‚Äôs not worth the price they paid for it.
2021-05-13 10:16:09,wallstreetbets,"Of course, you don‚Äôt understand the use of short selling and you try to tell me I am the one that has no idea"
2021-05-13 10:25:10,wallstreetbets,Well if they fall you can buy. What's the problem? Besides options and margin buys?
2021-05-13 11:53:20,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't call real estate undervalued atm, house prices have risen by like 20% from the ongoing pandemic shortage"

2021-05-13 12:52:55,wallstreetbets,Not all stocks are overvalued.  There are still value plays out there.  Look at Burry's 13F and buy everything he's holding and/or buying.  Sell what he's sold.

2021-05-13 12:41:35,wallstreetbets,So we should build the wall and mexico still out on top due to inflation?
2021-05-13 18:54:54,wallstreetbets,For ducks sake.
2021-05-13 16:49:12,wallstreetbets,The original definition of inflation is an increase in the money supply. You can see this when you look at the purchasing power of the dollar. A lot of the inflation doesn't translate because the money created doesn't enter the money supply or is shipped overseas when we buy products.
2021-05-13 12:26:15,wallstreetbets,"The US should just declare bankruptcy, bro."
2021-05-13 15:06:07,wallstreetbets,People will say they can just print more money to pay the debt.  On its face that sounds very wrong though.  I‚Äôm not an economist just saying it doesn‚Äôt pass the common sense sniff test
2021-05-13 19:30:23,wallstreetbets,Debt isn't a bad thing for a country to have. As long as you make more than you pay interest with it why wouldn't you want to take on more debt?

2021-05-13 10:19:54,wallstreetbets,"Step 1.  Get mortgage at 5%

Step 2.  Sell house on contract with 15% interest

Step 3.  Profit, 10% on the bank's money.

I saw that happen in the age of rising interest rates getting to the teens   Banks now tend to write ""no contracts"" into their mortgages so they don't miss that  money."
2021-05-13 12:14:44,wallstreetbets,Who cares when they only cost $50k to buy. The monthly mortgage carrying costs are higher at 1.5% then they were at 18% because the principle is so much higher today. It‚Äôs also a double fuck you since saving for a downpayment on a $500k house is way harder then saving for a downpayment on a $50k house.
2021-05-13 10:28:06,wallstreetbets,Who doesn't like high teens?
2021-05-13 13:03:15,wallstreetbets,Who cares with our 15 year fixed?
2021-05-13 13:11:48,wallstreetbets,But the prices were in the 5 digit range. I‚Äôll take that anyway.
2021-05-13 10:33:33,wallstreetbets,But the fashion
2021-05-13 13:58:23,wallstreetbets,Crazy how people aren't seeing this and dumping fiat currencies.
2021-05-13 10:05:18,wallstreetbets,Haha whoops. Clicked reply on the wrong comment. I agree the best time to buy has passed unless you're talking about commercial realestate which is still at historic lows.
2021-05-13 09:27:37,wallstreetbets,"""Financial crisis"" is kind of a generic term.  The specifics matter.  Inflation is a form of financial crisis. The OP is unclear on what kind of ""financial crisis"" he/she is positing.  Regardless, if inflation is the crisis being discussed (for this thread) then owning real estate is not a problem and *may* be much more beneficial than stocks or bonds.

To be clear, I'm not advocating one way or another, I'm just opening discussing based on the OP's posit.  Full disclosure, I own both stocks and HCOL real estate (and have a third of my portfolio in cash presently)."

2021-05-13 13:16:24,wallstreetbets,Seriously.  We saw a 10% real estate bump in one year in the DC Area right *before* the Pandemic thanks to anticipation of the Amazon move in.
2021-05-13 13:24:26,wallstreetbets,That doesn't mean they aren't under valued.

2021-05-13 12:25:58,wallstreetbets,"The cost to build per square foot isn‚Äôt too far off from the cost of per square foot to buy in most major metros right now. So by most indicators they are undervalue based on the cost of raw materials alone. 

While P/E has risen meaning there‚Äôs a disconnect between what companies are actually earning and what the market expects it to earn. 

Overvalue and undervalue isn‚Äôt about the actual price rising an X%."

2021-05-13 12:49:08,wallstreetbets,True but we would need a good lawyer....
2021-05-13 15:14:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, and considering the number 1 holder of us debt is us citizens... in pensions and such. It would be shit if it gets to the point they can't cover the debt"
2021-05-13 19:42:41,wallstreetbets,"There are healthy debt levels and then there is this trash we have right now. 127% debt to gdp plus what ever is actually on the books at the fed 6 trillion plus local and state debt. So in total local, state, federal government and reserve have about 38 trillion in debt. That is just beyond crazy. 

Debt is not inherently bad. If you can fund a project on low interest rates that's a great thing to do as a government. But that necessitates that you have a plan to pay it down.

Higher and higher debt loads turn a situation that would be a minor problem into a real issue until one day that next minor problem becomes a crisis. 

As we raise debt loads with no plan in the foreseeable future to even become neutral on our spending the government continues to take away options to solve any problems that may arise in the future."

Purchase cost/sf includes land and a depreciating structure. It's a super bad way to value real estate also. Commercial it can work because people will literally pay based on it, but in residential people can't eyeball it and most homes are at least 50-100sf off. Basements especially fuck this metric all to hell, and in residential real estate anything below street is a 'basement' even if it only has one wall that has earth contact.

Cost to build per sf does not include land... and it's actually really complex to get into unit price on a build ready site. Permits, site prep costs, ext can and often are in excess of actual land cost on a per unit basis for larger developments... adding in their buying power on materials and efficiencies in labor... it makes them very comparative with in place inventory generally and depending on the market they actually depress prices for the build period (the price in line with in place units, get preference, and leave in place units with less demand).

If you think inflation is the biggest risk in the future, getting a 4x or 5x leveraged loan at 3% fixed is a really effective way 'short' USD... which is a big reason why a lot of money is flowing into real estate."
2021-05-13 12:31:39,wallstreetbets,The raw materials themselves are temporarily overvalued
2021-05-13 13:13:33,wallstreetbets,"Thing is they are not getting that money in income that can be taxed.  It's all just building business value, and 1031 exchanges that let them cash in with no taxes paid."
2021-05-13 19:56:02,wallstreetbets,"How was it not a good definition when thats what everyone used for hundreds if not thousands of years? It can't be a bad definition because that was the word that was used to describe tye event. The actual supply of money is important because when you put more supply into the economy theres more money circulating which leads to a decrease in purchasing power. What do you think would happen if you put a trillion dollars into circulation?

If im not mistaken the reason why they changed the definition of inflation is because with the previous definition when prices went up and people found out it was because of inflation who did they blame? The government. They were the ones that were in charge of the inflated money supply so when prices went up they would get the blame. By changing the definition they could switch the blame to the private sector and blame ""greedy"" businesses."
2021-05-13 12:49:42,wallstreetbets,I hear Rudy Giuliani is looking for work
2021-05-13 10:28:16,wallstreetbets,"Except historically, that high level of interest rates and inflation does not last more than a couple of years and then comes crashing back down. Which is why its key to lock in the rates into long term CDs as opposed to variable rate financial products."
2021-05-13 10:18:02,wallstreetbets,"Who needs fucking loans when you can get $75K in guaranteed income a year. And when interest rates are that high, you can actually play a game where you arbitrage the future value on variable rate loans. You obtain variable rate loans and invest the money in a 30 CD that pays a lower rate of interest,  you take a brief short term loss but when the variable rate drops down you make bank off the arbitrage."
2021-05-13 11:54:21,wallstreetbets,Oh well. Sucks for people that don't own homes already or need loans for other reasons. Bring on the high rates!
2021-05-13 13:34:49,wallstreetbets,"You obviously have no idea what actually happened the last time rates hit 15%, the USD has never been ""very worthless"" even in periods of super high interest rates."
2021-05-13 11:55:16,wallstreetbets,No one that alrwady owns a home would sell their house at the point so no one cares. Except people that don't own homes. Lmfao
2021-05-13 11:39:36,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes frosted tips, shell necklaces, and two layers of polos (collars popped). Not to mention cargo shorts with all the pockets you could dream of."
2021-05-13 10:20:15,wallstreetbets,"I think rural real estate is still a big play. I put in an offer for 25 acres of hilly terrain in the Appalachians yesterday... Offered 85% of what they were asking, the realtor says the owner is considering it. Fingers crossed."
2021-05-13 12:55:32,wallstreetbets,"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
2021-05-13 13:22:23,wallstreetbets,THIS the part people never seem to get. Like the guy who is making 8 mil year is getting a weekly paycheck from a job that can be taxed as income.

2021-05-13 15:08:45,wallstreetbets,the man can‚Äôt plead for his life lol
2021-05-13 10:30:05,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre speaking facts. The guy replying you is just too accustomed to a debt based economy which he uses to finance shit he doesn‚Äôt need.
2021-05-13 10:19:50,wallstreetbets,Good luck.
2021-05-13 12:10:38,wallstreetbets,Everyone buying a home now better get comfortable living there as their home value crashes as interest rates move up. I'd rather invest for 10-15 years than borrow for 30 while buying the house at a discount
2021-05-13 12:21:55,wallstreetbets,"High rates help new buyers not owners.

Home prices will crash so the monthly payment doesn‚Äôt change. The only difference is it becomes easier for new buyers to afford a downpayment when homes are cheaper."
2021-05-13 13:02:53,wallstreetbets,I bought my house in 2001 and the interest was 7.1% But the house like many others was was reduced from. 158k to what I paid 131k. 2 years later refinanced at lower rate. Only issue will be if when they raise rates and housing prices don't come down.
2021-05-13 14:40:43,wallstreetbets,I say this because if EVERYONE can just live off of interest then where is the productivity?
2021-05-13 12:29:26,wallstreetbets,Where else am I going to keep my Yu-Gi-Oh deck on me?
2021-05-13 12:45:07,wallstreetbets,Flame shirts.
2021-05-13 10:57:39,wallstreetbets,Wow üòÆ I hope you get it. You are so right. The rural market is a whole different ball game. I wish I had extra cash right now to buy some.
2021-05-13 14:23:26,wallstreetbets,"You are absolutely wrong in your assumption about me.  

My 15 year fixed,  2.75% mortgage is the only debt I have.  
I pay in full for everything else.  I carry no revolving credit card debt. 

What you and others are missing is that a high interest rate effects the costs of every good or service you purchase.  

While you do get a better return on bond investments, the $75k return on a CD or bonds doesn‚Äôt go as far / isn‚Äôt worth the same as $75k in a low interest rate environment. 

The interest service on government debt increases significantly which either decreases services or will drive an increase  in taxes."
2021-05-13 13:21:28,wallstreetbets,If you wear a flame shirt you need cargo shorts to store all the phone numbers ladies will be giving you
2021-05-13 11:15:01,wallstreetbets,Just a question of how long you sit on that investment before it gains. Not very liquid at all but a safer investment long term.
2021-05-13 16:47:27,wallstreetbets,I could not give any less of a fuck

I don't want to be on yahoo finance 2+ hours a day or waking up in a frenzy when the market opens. 

yesterday everything was crashing because of inflation and today the market doesn't care??? this game is designed to take my fucking money. i'm worn out and just want to live well. i'm still up so i'm getting the fuck out while i can man. i'll still play with cheap FDs here and there because i can afford it and it's fun but no more yolos

2021-05-13 13:06:51,wallstreetbets,AMC... mother of god
2021-05-13 13:42:52,wallstreetbets,"tl;dr: Banks realized they were lending too much and don't wanna get caught with their pants down.

The reason for the selloff is the reserve requirement:

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm)

It's been at 0 for over 14 months straight. For those that don't know, this is the percentage of their capital banks must maintain in order to secure their loans. Typically a reserve requirement of about 10% will ensure something like a 7x money multiplier. When it's reduced to 0, banks can lend each other money back and forth with no regard for maintaining a balance. This combined with low interest rates means financial institutions went crazy with leverage.

JPow said he isn't raising interest rates. However, anyone with eyeballs can see inflation taking hold on almost every commodity, even Yellen sees it. Putting 2 and 2 together, they have to curb inflation but they don't want to raise the rates, so they'll force banks to be more fiscally responsible with their lending and speculation by raising the reserve requirements.

This hasn't been announced but the writing is on the wall. The selloff happening is banks reeling in their crazy lending spree and shoving that cash back into their vaults to meet the requirements they expect to be in place shortly. Since so much on the market was traded using leverage this is having a huge deflationary effect on speculative markets, even as real assets double in value."

And if you don't sell, market rallies back and the point of having the hedge is moot.

So wtf reddit.  Done with hedges, and puts.    Only calls, and buying dips.

Although some say dont BTD right now, only STR (sell the rip, ie. puts at the top instead of calls at bottom).

So maybe right now is a good time for puts. But I know it'll lose me money."

2021-05-13 07:04:25,wallstreetbets,"Especially when the redness is coming from interest rate speculation.

Suddenly everyone is an Econ PhD and an expert in macroeconomic inflation.

Fact 1: Lots of amazing companies (profitable, liquid, strong growth guidance) are already down 20-25%

Fact 2: The Fed will most likely keep rates the same as (1) US Treasury is heavily in debt, and cannot afford to increase rates, (2) hiking rates now would destroy chances of the economy coming back on its 2 feet

Fact 3: Supply chains are broken, last year was deflationary and worldwide GDP contracted, it's no fucking wonder people finally want to spend some money, and that demand exceeds supply (which is what results in inflation in the first place).

Fact 4: I am bullish

Fact 5: I am gay"

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Best chip shortage buy-in? I‚Äôm still very new to investing. Wrapping up my first year. Seen around a 250% increase so far. 

But I‚Äôm still discovering and learning about so many companies, good and bad. I‚Äôve done a little digging (literally 20-30 mins) into looking into a good choice for the microchip shortage. 

And I was wondering what are some you all like or are looking at? 

So far I think, Intel and $TSM seem to be the best options. TSM is one of the top semiconductor stocks. Intel is well, Intel. Been around and will be around for awhile. Only knock on Intel, is they are no longer working with Apple. But should still have an impact in supplying chips. Are there any others ones I should add to my list?"
2021-05-13 05:31:47,wallstreetbets,"You know the problem with shortages... It soon results in overproduction. Basically you can't increase production capacity too much, unless you can charge enough of a premium to make it worthwhile, because it will eventually result in excess capacity. It is a very sticky mess if you want to avoid spending millions to billions on CAPEX that goes to waste. Remember, these companies have to at least attempt to act for long-term value rather than doing things for short-term market gains.

Not saying not to invest in this stuff, but understand why these stocks might not move as you hope."

2021-05-13 15:30:18,wallstreetbets,"Semis are a cyclical industry.  Overproduction leads to supply cut and consolidation.  This fuels the next chip shortage and the race to increase capacity.  There is a secular growth underneath  as the demand for devices and semi components increases overtime.

For many of the chip stocks, it is reflected in the prices.  There will be a boom period, choppy sideway period and a bust period.  Right now, we are at the choppy sideway period.  You may pick up 10-20% if you can pick the bottom of the range, but the easy money has already been made in this cycle."
2021-05-13 05:22:15,wallstreetbets,"Chip shortages have been a thing since idk 2019 early 2020? It‚Äôs always been around because people are demanding lots more electronics.

One thing to note is shortage won‚Äôt increase price of chips because the operating margin of their customers are low. There‚Äôs only so much they can afford before they simply say no to a price hike. 

As far as semiconductors are involved, they are going to be around but will not be the 5-10x play in the year or so. Good sector nonetheless as a diversification in the portfolio where beta is at the lower end."
2021-05-13 05:34:31,wallstreetbets,"Investing in semiconductors is actually a big risk and it looks attractive because of the chip shortages however in the long run it's a huge risk.


The problem with semiconductors is the long period of time it needs to profit on investments. All semiconductors are investing crazy amounts of money and are incentivised to do so by governments and manufacturers of electronics.


This is very risky since a few decades ago we have seen the margins of semiconductors can get very slim and when the demand decreases a race to the bottom emerges. The only way to earn back the big initial investments is to keep producing chips even if the profitability is very low. This keeps going untill the smaller manufacturers can't cope with the costs anymore.


Examples are SMIC, globalfoundaries, even ASML had to cut massively in jobs 20 years ago.


Tl;dr it looks good but the industry isn't one with fat profit margins normally. asianometry makes good video's about it."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is Inflation for Real this time? The stronger than expected inflation data (Inflation rate for April year-on-year was +4.2% vs expectations of +3.6%) was the highest CPI print since Sep 2008 and was way higher than even the most bullish forecast. This spooked the market and led to a sell-off in both the bonds and stock market. 

Is this the inflation monster which the market fears but has not seen for years about to rear its head or this is, as the Federal Reserve will have us believe, all just transitory and nothing to write home about?

With this upside surprise in inflation, it is key to monitor what the Fed officials will say about this in the days ahead. Their message has been adamantly consistent that inflation prints will be higher due to base effects and supply constraints. They have been telling us that these high prints will be transitory and fall off as time passes and when the global supply chains are fully restored. 

For now, it‚Äôs just one data point, and on the heels of a disappointingly weak jobs number last week, it is likely that they will stay the course and stick to their message. Stay focused and don‚Äôt get swayed by the fear-mongers."

FED might have pull a fast one on Wall Street but my guess is most money managers are beginning to hedge against inflation by going into futures.

As far as inflation is concerned, it gets from bad to worse and fast. FED is playing a risky game with much more downside than upside in terms of inflation.

The whole point of being data-dependent in policy making is waiting for data to come in, one inflation print isn't enough to determine if inflation is transitory or permanent, and with used cars and airfare making up a chunk of the print, it's pretty convincing that the effects are transitory. Not to mention yoy was against last May, which saw inflation hovering around 0%, so you have to factor in base effect as well."
2021-05-13 05:42:37,wallstreetbets,"The thinking is as the economy picks up disruption to supply chains will cause short-term price increases. Eventually as supply gets back in order the prices will fall.

In terms of the money printer... The concern with that, I think, would be more about the velocity of money then necessarily some short-term price increases related to temporary supply-chain issues. If the economy picks up which will result in the velocity of money increasing, then we will see sustained as opposed to transitory inflation. The Fed would likely act then to raise rates to slow down the economy and help prevent inflation from growing out of control (and definitely from getting to the point where behavior is overly influenced by fears of inflation which would drive further inflation).

I do think the Government needs to at some point raise taxes to pull some of the excess liquidity out of the system. Perhaps also cut the budget, but not at the expense of reducing demand in the economy too much. If the Fed and the Government both do their jobs properly here I think we can get out of this mess without major inflation, but there has to be a willingness to raise taxes as otherwise the Fed's monetary policy will be increasingly predetermined by a few data points (as it is now) which may impact their ability to deal with other issues down the line."

the only thing why this will be an even better bear play is that momentum starts working against her. It happened with Warren Buffett and he caught it after a string of occurrences when he buys a position people instantly sell. His name becomes toxic and people recognize the trend.

Your call is right. The reasoning is wrong.

Cathy is fine in what she is doing. She picked a lane and is staying in that lane. Her fund is for investors that want to speculate in tech. For her to shift her focus to non innovation names would be false advertising and give a disservice to her investors.

It is her investors who should be selling out as the market is adjusting. Between the rotation trade and interest rates rising, these stocks are going to be hard to continue to speculate.

I was never a big fan of the Ark funds, but I respect her for being consistent. I don't agree with all of her ideas, but I wouldn't say she is dumb.

2021-05-13 06:07:51,wallstreetbets,"The speed of innovation in many key areas is accelerating much faster now than ever. Take something like self-driving cars. Whoever solves it will likely have a multi-trillion dollar business. Mining Asteroids which may seem ridiculous might one day be a multi-trillion dollar business that enables us to build better batteries, motors, etc. Look at that huge spacecraft that Elon Musk is building. It is a game changer (and hey they got it to land without blowing up!). What about in biotech. Better understanding each day of the body will enable development of therapies that would have been impossible before.

Of course food and consumables are important and will be here for a long-time and perhaps do well (until tech completely reboots food... Beyond Meat is just the trickle before the flood) but woe to anyone that discards the ability of tech to disrupt their business. The tech of tomorrow will be much more capable than tech of today and what seems impossible now, will be child's play tomorrow.

Perhaps tech stocks will fare poorly for the next decade, but eventually when they do have their next run, you will  look back and only wish you had invested heavier in tech. Anyone with a 20 year investment timeline who is not heavily invested in tech is simply an idiot. Warren Buffett is a great value investor but he has consistently been wrong on tech.

Just to put something in perspective BRK.A was at $75,000 a share at the peak of the dotcom era (and his company was mostly isolated from the meltdown then), it is now at $425,000 a 5.6X return. AMZN in that period using its peak price is up over 30X. GOOG was not around yet, but since 2004 it is up over 40X. MSFT is only up from the dotcom peak about 4.5X so a little worse than BRK.A.  AAPL is up about 100X from then. ARKK from its inception in Oct 2014 is up about 5X (in that period BRK.A is up maybe a little more than 2X). Yes there were some spectacular busts (e.g. BB), but tech companies that were successful completely destroyed the performance of their traditional peers.

Bottom line, only the most stubborn fool (maybe a very smart one who has a solid record overall) would suggest that tech is not where you should be investing and instead you should invest in whatever traditional businesses instead. A person who is good at understanding various technologies and their potential, like Cathy, will in the long run completely destroy the performance of someone like Warren Buffett who lacks that ability."
2021-05-13 06:55:06,wallstreetbets,"I agree to most of your points and I am not saying tech is going to be a bad investment. Just be fluid in investing and that will be the most helpful tool to get returns.

There are also apparently no major scientific advancements in making EV's apparently, yet practically the disruption of such tech being made practical is pretty hard to comprehend. It is creating a whole new massive battery industry. Furthering solar panels and other green energy development. It will lead to a massive reduction in oil being extracted from the ground. It will reduce the need for the number of oil tankers and oil trucks. It will eliminate the need for gas stations (Well you will need charging locations, which can be curb side). It will help reduce pollution and carbon emissions.

Simply put you are wrong. Innovation disrupting the world is only increasing. Maybe academic scientific achievement has slown down, but that is not the same as practical innovation."

2021-05-13 13:42:02,wallstreetbets,Very true. Listened to an interview with Singh (QS) and Munro and Singh talked about that having a full set of equipment in house (which is expensive) and running multiple shifts allowed them to iterate in ten years what would have taken 40 years had they had to go back and forth with labs and not running multiple shifts. It took investors willing to give them sufficient funding and a drive for innovation. Boomer companies tend to be happy with the status quo and won't fix what is not broken (and when they find out it was broken it often is a bit late... eg... auto companies coming late to the EV game).

You can sell high and buy the same stock again lower.

I agree you should buy for the long term and you obviously believe this is the floor so you should definitely buy Tesla etc now.
I think there is more bleeding to be done on the high valuation stocks.

I hope Tesla works out for you. 
We all want to see green."
2021-05-13 04:27:02,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äòs really not what I mean tho. High P/E stocks and specs in general are bleeding since Feb or so. Time to sell was either Dezember/Jan or never. 

Also, I don‚Äòt believe this is the botton, I believe I will never time the bottom. But I know Tesla won‚Äòt drop 90% from ATH‚Äòs so I‚Äòm buying whenever shares fall below $600, same with other stocks. 

I see your argument when looking at the indices, as they haven‚Äòt moved much. There‚Äòs probably more bleeding as you say, but it will be in the exact stocks you recommend... EV/specs are down 30-60% while consumer staples and recovery stocks have surged. Markets always find a equilibrium, so either you believe specs/EV will rubber-band up to level out with recovery or the other way around. I believe recovery (and with that said the indices) will drop to level out until the correction is over. But EV/specs won‚Äòt drop more than 20%, because there isn‚Äòt mire space to go lower. 

Just my opinion, but I have been in the markets for a while... still, i hope AAPL works for you, I also bought some shares yesterday and planning to add when it drops more, but to me it‚Äòs a safe long time play while specs are the ones making bank."
2021-05-13 04:45:30,wallstreetbets,"You can‚Äôt time the bottom or top but I try to manage risk.

I have a few stocks that I never sell, mostly because I started buying since 2012 so my cost basis is really low. Appl , V , JPM , Googl  etc 
I just add to these on any dips. 
I‚Äôll add to APPL next week if it goes lower than $120. 

The ones I sold recently are LMND , Teledoc , NVDA, SQ etc as I could see a downward trend. 
I didn‚Äôt sell at an ATH but made profit on each one and can buy them all again a lot cheaper.
As these had high valuations they were going to get killed and they did. For me it was time to exit and keep some cash.

I will definitely get back into semiconductors and Teledoc as I believe they will be good in the long term but I‚Äôm happy to be patient and buy near the bottom. 

I‚Äôm just waiting to see what direction the market goes.
I have cash now to buy puts so I can make back some of my losses if the market continues to go down."

2021-05-13 02:38:05,wallstreetbets,"Speaking of Soccer, did you guys check out $ibgr?

.10 and it can seen muy mucho dollars.

Soccer is the biggest sport in the world and the the biggest league in the world with having the most selling merchandise in something what's s called the Premier League. Not the NBA,MLB, or NFL. We had two teams in the Premier League in the past and that was and still is a game changer for anyone in this field. Truly a remarkable achievement...

So check this out. We had a contract in 2016 with the Queens Park Rangers in the PL for 10 years. We didn't know what that contract was worth until we recently found that Nike signed a contract with QPR back in 2014. It was speculated to be worth around $80 million a year for Nike, and $12 million a year for QPR. Two years, later, we sign a huge contract with them.
Keepp in mind, we also found out a contract we had with Watford in 2016 which was worth almost as much.

Now what happens if we were to sign another mid tier team or two in the Premier League? Our name would be plastered everywhere. Think, merchandises, banners, screen monitors, our logos on the players jerseys with having fox sports, espn, and other variant streaming platforms covering us in the biggest global sport sport in the world. And, were talking about the biggest stadiums in the world folks. Everyone in the world will know us lightning fast. The amount of fandom with these soccer jerseys are on a whole notha level.

The great thing here for the new on lookers is that nobody knows about this sleeping giant yet. It's flying way under the radar.

Another pos today with 3.7 billion in the o/s was rumored in having an MJ company rolling in with $4 million in gross revs. They reached to over a $500 million market cap. There's a plethora ofnthese pennies that did the same thing.

And our market cap is only worth $15 million...


The potential here far exceeds in what I counted to be worth over $250 million in contracts we had in 2016. One example is there's about a dozen or more Top Teams that could generate $2 billion or more, every year with just one top team. And it was confirmed to us that they were indeed working on a high profile team. Who knows how many at this point.

If you look at LULU, another sport brand company, whom hasn't shown me the level of innovation Dryworld has produced, is¬†trading¬†at around $330 per share today with $4 billion in revenues. Their o/s is 135 million, and our is 140 million. Plus 25 million shares for the new owners once they transfer the shares over.

Now this is where things heat up dramatically in the fundamentals. The price to earnings ratio in our space is anywhere from a minimum of 50x to over 100x in earnings. It's massive...

And that's just 1 component of many avenues in where we can make a substantial amount of revenues.

They crazy thing is, it's all plausible.

Our patented and proprietary products are so innovative that there were nothing else like them in the market place. In terms with our contracts and innovation, we beat out the likes of Nike, Adidas, Under Armour and Puma back then.

And since we just got that amended filing about a week ago, the sentiment here was that once that was corrected, it was, oh shit, get ready. The Q should be coming shortly as well. Not to mention the corporate update and a new cusip number...

In the current state of the OTC where we see all these pieces of shit go to have hundreds of millions in the market cap, if not billions, may I remind you, that our market cap is worth a measly $15 million, and knows about it.

I feel this has a legitimate and feasible shot to go down in the history books. One for the ages and imo, hardly far-fetched...


The OTC world ain't seen nothing yet. Believe that..."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Stocks Crashing DD - Due to Final Tax Week It's the last week before taxes are due. 2020 was a substantial bull market where huge gains were made, and many new users in platforms like Robinhood made money off of short term trades without realizing the tax repercussions. The current price of Tesla is a clear example of that. I personally owed 40% tax on my gains from last year and had to sell a substantial portion of my stock portfolio due to this.

Most Robinhood users I've talked to don't understand that you're taxed on the gain from each trade rather than your overall gains for last year. On top of that, you can only write-off $3k of losses.

If you look at the stock market crash of 2000, similar activity drove a crash.

The situation you described is correct - if you make money first, then lose money the next year, you are much much worse off. You can only deduct up to 3k in short term losses from _normal income_. 

Important to note that if you lose 2mm in 2019, then make 1mm in 2020, you _can_ carry forward the 2019 loss and deduct it from the 2020 gain - but in both years only 3k could then _also_ be deducted from normal, non-trading income.

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Take a Trip with MindMed Alright, we don‚Äôt have much time; the Adderall is wearing off and I have a lot to type. Put this on your tongue and listen up. The topic for discussion today is MindMed:MNMD. I don‚Äôt want to lose anyone when it starts kicking in, so I‚Äôm going to break it up into sections. Also, obvious disclaimer, this is not financial advice, I‚Äôm just a drug addict.

TL;DR MNMD is bottoming out for its first time after hitting NASDAQ, and it looks like its ramping up to it's next peak.

First off, if you don‚Äôt know already (and if you don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt know how the fuck you got here in the first place) MindMed is a Canadian based company researching medical treatments for depression, drug addiction, depression, PTSD, and pain utilizing psychedelics and other entactogenic substances like MDMA. Mental health treatment is suffering from a severe lack of highly successful treatments and will be seeing a massive increase in attention due to the growing global acceptance of mental disorders. The other area of focus is pain; one of the largest markets for pharmacological substances. And, thanks to the opioid epidemic, many jurisdictions are open to finding alternative treatments for pain at *any* cost simply to save lives. Highly scrutinizing the sale of one of the largest revenue-generating pain medications leaves a bit of demand in its wake, as not only doctors but politicians and citizens are looking for a safer drug for physical pain. Not to mention, how are we going to continue to treat all of the individuals who became addicted to these substances due to malpractice? Welcome, MindMed. That‚Äôs right, there‚Äôs hope to get mental health on track, physical pain managed, and addiction to those previous substances all treated with *one* class of drug. Psychedelics.

So yes, that‚Äôs a lot of good news. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the downside?‚Äù, you may be wondering. ‚ÄúI saw a bearish sentiment that the psychedelic market is gonna be a bloodbath! They‚Äôre all using the same drugs.‚Äù Yeah, yeah, shut the fuck up. This fucking company has patents ‚Äì *already has patents* ‚Äì for an LSD trip neutralizing agent. Ever been tripping balls and wanted nothing but the room to stop breathing and you mom to give you a nice glass of milk? *This* is that nice glass of milk. No psychiatrist is going to want their patients to feel side effects of their treatment, if using high doses, for any longer than necessary during the appointment. It would be a terrible idea. Make a mistake and take more than prescribed (yes, it does happen to people who aren‚Äôt drug addicts like I am)? Having a neutralizing agent for such a long lasting drug is *necessary* and already patented by this company. I‚Äôm just getting fucking started.

Ever heard of the state Oregon? Yeah, me neither. But it turns out they legalized the sale and purchase of psilocybin containing mushrooms recreationally (Edit: Okay I've been corrected and this was a lil bit of an oversight. They weren't legalized recreationally, use is only permitted in specific therapeutic situations. However, most(?) drug possession is decriminalized which is a step in the right direction. Leaving the original because it's funny in retrospect). Those same drugs that everyone talks about in pop-culture from music to current movies? That the entire public is so intrigued with right now? Once one state legalizes, its only a matter of time before more catch on. In fact, California is attempting to pass legislation for the possession and sale of mushrooms. The state with the *largest* recreational drug market. If all of this wasn‚Äôt enough already, I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôve gotten this far. But that‚Äôs only why everyone should *obviously* have bullish sentiment for this company. Now‚Äôs time for me to show you my pretty graphs.

[MindMed Peaks](https://preview.redd.it/14dr9cx1bty61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d046dc0b4213fcf1ddb90d889ecbf2fda157f572)

Notice the volume April 27 of this year. That‚Äôs the day it got listed to Nasdaq. If you can‚Äôt find it, I‚Äôll make it easy. It‚Äôs the largest volume bar. Now it‚Äôs obvious volume would be much, much higher in its opening days on the exchange. The numbers are staggering, though. In the first five days trading on Nasdaq, MindMed volume was about 160 million‚Ä¶ over half of it‚Äôs float and about 8 weeks worth of average volume from when it was a penny stock. Interest in the company continues to increase from media attention, people are buying up the float fast, and‚Ä¶ price is falling. In fact, the price is currently about 75% of it‚Äôs highest peak as a penny stock, and half it‚Äôs debut open. After rising above the $2 point in late 2020, price has never gone below that. Current support looks like it doesn‚Äôt want to fall too far below $3 now. This will most likely be the lowest price for the next few months, if not ever if we go off historical data. So that‚Äôs all well and good but‚Ä¶ Where‚Äôs it going next?

Drawing the most conservative extension lines for the original $5 price movement and following retracement from December 2020 until April of this year, Fibonacci retracements would have be able to be used to predict a 100% retracement of $5.69. And what was the upper extreme for the next price movement? $5.77.

[FibExtensions Second Peak](https://preview.redd.it/tyrlykh6bty61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c72b5deb6d570e62b2df033d4cc6e2ca271a83b1)

Notice the price increase entering, and maintaining, support at the 23.6% extension line, about $2.93. This is the current price, riding the 23.6% extension line and refusing to stay below for the past WTD. That‚Äôs all well and good, but that price movement already happened. So how about extension lines from the most recent peak and retracement?

&#x200B;

[Fib Extensions Current Movement](https://preview.redd.it/w955y32abty61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5f52e276e30277cbf5b81f5a2bf634161cfad87)

Ahh, that‚Äôs more like it. Because this has all occurred in the same uptrend, I kept a similar start point for the price movement. If we predict the exact momentum as last time, The price should reach about $7.80 at it‚Äôs next peak. However, notice that each peak has gotten higher and higher. While there was a long retracement and profit taking period, MindMed is actually still on the same uptrend that started in late 2020. So $7.80 is a safe guess, but it might have the momentum this time to hit the next extension -- $10.85. Those are some juicy profits. Especially when the first options ever traded for MindMed expire May 21 with the highest strike point at $7.5. *Beneath* the historically expected price movement. If risk isn‚Äôt your thing, the $5 strike point options would be incredible profit at even the lowest extension point.

Here‚Äôs the profit spread on those 7.5 strike calls at 100 contracts:

&#x200B;

[May21 7.5C](https://preview.redd.it/qqldxlzebty61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=55443a653fa3e3c8d4b3c60f386259144765a8d6)

$500 is dirt cheap when the higher end of the price movement could net 5 digits. ‚ÄúBut why is there reason to believe it would hit that price point before expiration?‚Äù I‚Äôm glad you asked.

&#x200B;

[Time Extensions for current movement](https://preview.redd.it/nx9tfl8ibty61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=7834766c3b5b32ccf9695f98d4a793866dea734b)

Behold, the most beautiful graph I have ever laid my eyes on. Using Fibonacci time extensions on the two previous price increases, we get a two day range predicting the next peak, given that both extensions are drawn from the two greatest peaks. Despite such a different time frame, both of these extensions are 100% extensions, based on time, from both of the last peaks in price. Right before those first options expire. Not only that, but drawing an oval to visualize an upside down parabola. The slope of the price decrease following the last increase rides along the slope of the oval pictured. When in this type of price formation, generally the slope of the line will leave the parabola at the same slope it entered following it‚Äôs second touch on the right side, after the trend has reversed upwards. The graph already touched once on May 11 and May 12 it closed on the second touch point following the support from the last day and a half. Next stop is the breakout period, which also lines up in the middle of the time frame expected for the next price increase.

From there, call options can be exercised for the $5 strike point, which will drive the price higher. And there‚Äôs a ton of open interest.

I think I rest my case.

Make a mistake and take more than prescribed (yes, it does happen to people who aren‚Äôt drug addicts like I am)?

Some more than others like the Cdn gov especially conservatives since they were the one's in power provincially. Marijuana was legalized in 2018, and Canada had some of the biggest producers in NA. First mover advantage right? Well for a while they had that, and some snatched up production in SA, Europe. However, here we are in 2021. Despite covid these companies had a lead, they just didn't have effective government. For example in Ontario one of the most population dense provinces weed could only be sold in an authorized store. This caused massive delay's.  You had product that wasn't being shipped out. If you want to buy online, you have to by through a government store. Which is stupid since it should be free market. All that time  and red tape cost money. Now you have US legalization, and a far more lucrative market than Canada; I can't speak for the US gov, but from what I see at the federal level under Biden and blue states, you guy's have better leaders than we do. These Canadian companies may be able to compete but likely will get bought out for much lower value as they get suffocated by other entities."

2021-05-13 04:24:32,wallstreetbets,"I just did my thesis on the medical applications of Psolicybin for treatment resistant depression (if anyone wants it DM me and I'll get you it) . 

 Quick Notes:

13.2% of American Adults 18+ take SSRIs

Current antidepressants (SSRIs) do work.. they lower symptoms by 50% for only 60% of patients. 40% had no reduction, and 100% were still symptomatic.

Psilocybin + Therapy reduced symptoms by 60% for all patients (12), after a single treatment consisting of 10mg oral Psilocybin. After a second dose of 25mg oral Psilocybin a week later, symptoms were reduced by 80% for 3 patients, and 100% for 9 patients.

Project Angie: (Mind Medicine) Research shows that pre dosage with an LSD compound removes the need for post surgical analgesics for up to 36 hours.This is good for health care because less opiates, but bad for big pharma.

Problems: Not a single company is working with a unique compound. So far, zero pharmaceutical innovation.  They are innovative with their treatment however. FDA approval is doubtful until at least 2023, but they can work in other countries that allow clinical applications of psychedelics. 

Keep in mind, these companies have isolated the useful compounds and have taken out the 'trip'... (if you've done Psychedelics, you'll understand this). Changes the way you think about life, no pretty lights. But this is for medical purposes, our recreational stuff is gonna stay the same.

TL;DR

Psychedelics work better than SSRIs, with less doses needed.
Long term investment until FDA approval.
Don't invest because its drugs, invest because you believe the science and believe in the companies."
2021-05-13 09:48:07,wallstreetbets,Escpecially since in the US if you tag something as medical then you have free reign to mark the prices up to astronomical levels since the insurance industry specifically wants mark ups on medical costs to disssuade anyone from going without coverage.

I would randomly have flare-ups where it was worse, but yeah it's been over a year where the microdose flare-up seemed to make my ""new normal"" noticeably worse than it was before. I did have a phone appointment with my GI doc about a year ago, and he didn't seem that concerned. Gave me some pills that didn't help (I think more acid inhibitors and muscle relaxers that never helped before). Now that I'm vaxxed, I was planning on seeing him in person for other possible tests.

First 2 times I tried micro, I just ate them. But after having the gut issues I actually started doing alcohol extraction tek... it was definitely better (and I'm sure that would kill any mold) but still caused enough issues that I stopped.

They've been the biggest company since before they had streaming services or integrated accessories. They marketed and designed a product very well and it flew off the shelves, those same people who bought it didn't buy another device for a year or so.

2021-05-13 06:48:34,wallstreetbets,I'm currently working in Germanyband this university hospital has no ketamine and would never think about using ketamine. The only time I ever saw ketamine used was as a medic in the army. (US Army)
2021-05-13 06:59:10,wallstreetbets,"Also look at the post and think about analgesic vs antidepressant use. Ketamine will not be used worldwide as an antidepressant. It will still be used as an analgesic due to it being low risk compared to opiates, less addictive, and the K-Hole prevents PTSD in some patients because they won't remember the injury due to ketamines effect ion short term memory."
2021-05-13 08:59:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah and in my 20s I would have loved this idea fuck it lets make coke and percocet legal too while we're at it.  

And you will live to see it legal just not in this country. Recreational psychedelic use is a non starter anybody who has ever taken a good dose of acid or shrooms would have to be fucking insane to think you know what we should let everyone do this whenever they want. Ive done just about every drug out there and theres very few where I would say nowadays you know what this should be legal."
2021-05-13 07:04:19,wallstreetbets,I don't want to contradict someone working on the ground as it were but it is used very commonly as part of normal surgical procedures. Maybe Germany is the exception. Might be worth talking to an anaesthetist though.
2021-05-13 08:28:56,wallstreetbets,Just gonna piggyback after reading a few of your back and forth comments. In Canada we are using Ketamine alongside psychotherapy! I wouldn't discount it as a poor investment yet. A company like Field Trip Health will do just fine (I think).
2021-05-13 09:03:31,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you were one of the idiots who didn‚Äôt educate yourselves about acid or shrooms before you took them... cuz everyone I‚Äôve known who‚Äôs actually done the research and tested their shit and done it the right way would disagree with you, and I think if everyone took a tab of acid there would be a lot less violence in the world... the fact that you‚Äôre comparing Coke and Percocet to acid shows me you probably don‚Äôt know much about the actual medical benefits of these drugs, or even know how the drugs work and interact with our brain for that matter... I‚Äôve done just about every drug there is too, and if I had the chance to go back and change my Percocet addiction and stop doing coke I would, but psychedelics only ever did good things for me and actually helped me get out of that hole."
2021-05-13 07:13:59,wallstreetbets,"Again, we are talking about the drugs use as a psych drug and not its use as an analgesic"
2021-05-13 07:26:38,wallstreetbets,"Clearly it's not widely used as a psych drug, my point was whether it being more commonly used and accepted in medicine already would make it an easier transition to psychiatric use.

I think maybe you misunderstood my initial point."
2021-05-13 07:38:35,wallstreetbets,"The psychological side effects of Ketamine are what will hinder it from being used as anything other than an analgesic. (Effectively)

Think about taking a drug that causes short term memory loss during the active part of the drugs physiological effect on the body.

Combine that with therapy.

Short interest only gets reported in two week intervals. On the 30th, the shorts have to either cover or it gets reported. It was building up over 8 weeks straight. Right after that, the downward pressure continued. There was no news that day, nothing.

Yes yes, soon after everything else went to shit and TSLA got fucked even harder. With all the shit that's happened this year with short squeezes, I suspect that shorts are just a tiny bit more hesitant about disclosing their positions. This is not a fucking short squeeze so don't start that ape shit.

The 15th is on Saturday, so they'll have to close out their position by Friday and send the stock up. It might be down in the depths of hell by then so even a 20% day won't really mean much. Each day tech sells off a bit, TSLA sells off even more like 5% - 6%, you can bet your ass that the same shits gonna happen this Friday

 *‚ÄúNeither Bull nor Bear‚Äú* for Dow , Nasdaq,currency , Bull for physical silver clearly as stated in my previous posts and very sympatic for GME   that's my position  and whole fortune at the moment until transitory inflation end!

 

A growing deflationary hurricane is churning off the coast. At the same time, a massive inflationary warm front is surging toward us, threatening inflation like we have not seen in forty years. ¬†As if forecasting future economic conditions was not tricky enough, both systems are being fueled in unknown ways by the convergence of historical amounts of monetary and fiscal stimulus.

The two ominous and encroaching weather systems make economic and market forecasting extremely difficult. The most recent evidence came from last week‚Äôs BLS employment report. The consensus of economic forecasters missed the mark by 734,000 jobs. That is over three times the average monthly job growth pre-pandemic.

To add insult to injury, consider forecasters must also untangle global supply line problems and resulting shortages of many commodities and finished goods. Further, robust pent-up demand from the lifting of economic restrictions and a global pandemic significantly influences the economic climate.

Despite such extraordinary circumstances, the level of confidence in economic and market forecasts is remarkably high. Many ‚Äúexperts‚Äù forecast beautiful days with a temporary bout of above-average inflation. There is nary a mention of the potential for debilitating inflation and almost no recognition of the troubling deflationary hurricane off at sea.

**The confidence and hubris backing forecasts should be of great concern, not comfort.**

 Misplaced Confidence

How a simple flap of a butterfly wing can change the environment attests to the difficulty in predicting the weather. Meteorologists are quick to describe their limitations and relatively poor level of confidence around longer-range forecasts. They understand the impossibility of calculating millions of variable factors affecting the weather.

During more typical economic and market conditions, prognosticators struggle with forecasts. For example, the first graph below shows how the Fed consistently overestimated economic growth coming out of the last recession.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e9s0bola2sy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a51fd6005d773753fe0bef70b845d31f93902e1e

 The following graph, courtesy of Deutsche Bank, highlights how Wall Street economists have consistently erred in their expectations for higher interest rates over the last fifteen years. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[ As the title of the next graph tells, investors have a long history of poor Fed Funds forecasts. ](https://preview.redd.it/r842x12e2sy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7798a2068bfb765db5950e252d7af2013fdc2c71)

Today, those at the Fed offer investors a good amount of confidence in predicting the pace of the economic recovery. They appear highly confident that any spurt of inflation will be transitory. If wrong, they offer complete confidence in their unproven tools to halt inflation. We know from historical experience that when the inflation genie gets out of the bottle, it is very difficult to arrest.

Wall Street analysts shrug off record equity and bond market valuations with forecasts of growth and normality.¬† Investors buying in at such valuations must have total trust that the Fed and Wall Street are correct. Despite the evidence that professional economic prognosticators are not very good at their jobs, everyone seems assured of the future.

The graphs below show money supply growth, and the fiscal deficit are at levels that are anything but ordinary. Are we to believe the effects and consequences of such extreme monetary and fiscal policy, occurring concurrently, are easy to predict? **What kind of professional would fail to recognize the peril of such a claim?**

## Summary :

*Bulls win in Bull Markets; Bears win in Bear Markets. Eagles soar above and take advantage of opportunity. Let us help you soar as you reach your financial goals I am bull for silver .But no advice for stocks , currency or other financial assets as  Neither Bull nor Bear.*

Quite often, investors are rewarded for going against the crowd, especially when the masses are in agreement on what the future holds.

 The reality is like meteorologists predicting next week‚Äôs weather; no one knows what the economy holds in store. Of course, they can extrapolate current trends and make educated guesses on how consumers and corporations react to future events. Still, no one has ever experienced anything like what we face today.

2021-05-12 21:59:15,wallstreetbets,My general understanding is that inflation leads to higher interest rates which leads to money being harder to get (particularly hurting growth companies which need easy access to money) & being put into things other then stocks.
2021-05-13 17:42:35,wallstreetbets,Fuck
2021-05-13 02:31:34,wallstreetbets,Look up Zimbabwe inflation for your history lesson.
2021-05-12 22:38:47,wallstreetbets,I agree on the first part. But where does the money go? I get that money might flow from unprofitable cos to profitable and dividend paying but those safe havens only seem appealing in an Armageddon. I'll probably get some precious metals just in case all the doomers are right but fully expect to sell them in a year for less.
2021-05-13 08:21:55,wallstreetbets,"If the value of the dollar goes down, the price of things denominated in that dollar, like stocks, will go up.  There is a good case to be made that, very long term, the overall market rise is entirely attributable to just population growth+inflation.

Short term, maybe the problem is that the catastrophic effects of the coronavirus policies were obvious, and everybody front-ran the inflation already."
2021-05-13 17:42:58,wallstreetbets,No seems I got it
2021-05-12 23:00:14,wallstreetbets,It means that there is less dispensable money to invest as the price of goods increases which hurts stocks
2021-05-13 10:39:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah long term (thinking infinitely long) that‚Äôs of course true, you see it on every index. It just makes sense, of course market caps increase as there is more money in circulation. The concern is what happens while inflation is high or is on an inflection point/reversed, which is what my explanation was for."
2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"OMG! Inflation. Soooo... let me get this straight.. we're selling our assets because we think the threat of inflation is worse than what the Fed is making it out to be? 

Fair, on being skeptical on the Fed's downplaying this.. But! Last time I checked, inflation isn't where asset values deflate, they inlfate. It's the currency that loses value. Not assets, especially assets that are known to hedge against inflation. If inflation is your threat, converting assets into currency seems a bit, ironic to say the least..

Conclusion: To me, the market's response is overreactive. We got a lot of new investors and traders out there. Including me. But, the key is understanding the driving force behind inflation along with it's cause/effect.

I don't know about you but, I'm buying the dip. Especially inflation hedges. As the old saying goes.. ""Buy into weakness, sell into strength."". Pullbacks are Bullish~ No, Stonks don't always go up. Once the panic selling slows.. this is screaming buy if you ask me.

Not financial advice. Just my thoughts.

Peace~

Update:

Negative rates are a thing. It's all the rage in Europe, for the last couple years.

I am not saying this WILL happen but, for those hopping on the raise in the Fed Funds Rate bandwagon.. when everything the Fed has been saying for months on end is that there is no foreseeable change in policy, potentially as far out as 3 years..

I ask, rhetorically.. What do you think the US Fed will do.. Follow suit with the rest of the Central Banks of the world in Negative Federal rates or go out on a limb and raise the Fed Funds Rate?

Place your bets accordingly~

I don't believe that the US Fed has the balls to raise rates with how huge the bubble is today. We are way beyond 2008. Think about it.. if you were Jerome Powell would you want to be the guy to pull that trigger? I don't think so. He's probably peeing in his pants right now since the market is forcing his hand to do something. I know I would be pissing into a puddle of my tears if I were him. Talk about pressure!

I think Jerome Powell will more than likely try to buy himself time by increasing asset purchases for the next 8 months and serve his term as safe as possible. Then, pass the buck off to the next face puppet Chairmen. Meaning he'll keep rates the way they are or lower them into the negative by .25%. Or at least adjust assets purchases and a negative rate by how much investors freak out. Powell isn't the type to grab the Bull by the horns, if you will. So, mild fluctuations in Fed policy at best.

I just don't think our Fed is smart nor brave enough to take the controlled fire approach and raise rates. Not yet anyways.. Especially, when we're not seeing rates rising with the Central Banks of the world. If anything, they're willing to go into the negative from what I've seen, not assume. Which, assumption is the entire basis of the argument of those who think they'll raise rates.

Just my two cents though. This is a fantastic discussion btw~

Still not financial advice."
2021-05-12 20:00:14,wallstreetbets,"Higher inflation usually comes with higher interest rates because higher interest rates combats the inflation. Higher interest rates means that bonds become more lucrative. Money moves from stocks to bonds. 

Higher interest rates also means debt becomes more dangerous and more difficult to pay back. Companies that don‚Äôt earn profit and have lots of debt are susceptible to default and chapter 11. These stocks usually drop the heaviest."

2021-05-12 20:47:01,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you 100%. When inflation is high, dollar has low value. People invest in assets including real estate, gold and also stocks. So eventually sock prices should go up. The only problem is the bond yield which go up with inflation and make it more expensive to borrow. Having said that, when you invest in healthy companies , which I mean, the ones with healthy PE ratio and lots of cash on hand, you will always be a winner."
2021-05-13 00:13:22,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôre never going to raise % rates.  They‚Äôve been trying to go to ZLB forever.  Their arsenal is dry.  They‚Äôve no more financial tools.  2008 destroyed their monetary policy tools.

2021-05-13 01:51:32,wallstreetbets,"It always surprises me how much academic ivory tower theory crafting is taken as scripture.
I'm going to call it now. ""rates"" will not be rising anytime soon. Yes, the fed may try and raise the 2s but it's going to cause the same inverted curve like it did in 2017 and 2018. Rates out past the 5s will not go up because something like 70% of the developed world has negative yields. Money will continue to flow to the +5yr portion of the curve (like it already is doing). 

There is definitely going to be some heart burn and choppiness in the market but rates won't keep up with inflation and high quality companies with pricing power (think apple), inflation proof(think Visa), or required services (think healthcare) will all ride out inflation and keep up with it."

2021-05-13 00:38:01,wallstreetbets,"The market already knew there was inflation. The reason the market dropped is because the fed finally admitted that it existed, and they might do something.  


The market priced in a very small reaction by the federal reserve.  


Do NOT read this as stocks losing value due to inflation. Inflation can be a mixed bag for stocks, but even gold and silver were down. That doesn't signal a reaction to inflation. It's a reaction to the fed's reaction to inflation.  


Gold and silver didn't move much, which says that the market believes whatever the fed does will be minimal. I think that's probably correct.  


Effects of inflation can be complicated so the long term bear case does exist, but it is weak at this point."

2021-05-12 21:10:48,wallstreetbets,"I agree that people are overreacting but I don‚Äôt think you have a fundamental understanding of how monetary policy and economics works. If inflation gets out of control, fed has to raise rates to slow spending. Sending people out of the stock market and into bonds and savings. Not to mention it‚Äôs bad for consumers to have to deal with higher prices. Anyways it‚Äôs about the economic effects. Think beyond your meme stocks."
2021-05-12 21:57:54,wallstreetbets,"Inflation increases the cost of materials to make things if this happens top quickly then people won't be able to afford to buy the things you're making. Meaning you can't price hike your way out of it. 

Homes for example. A new house costs a lot of money and low interest rates drove the demand up. Couple that with lumber production bottlenecked at the saw mills and the cost to build a home increases faster than people's concept of what a that home should cost to buy. 

Keep in mind everyone is trying to be first so they're anticipating that certain sectors might cool down a little. 

TSLA needs copper, lithium, etc to make their cars. All those things are going up. Inflation also means interest rates might increase to tamp down demand and so there is another issue that can drive down spending. 

So if people are pulling out to get cash it might be worth having cash on hand to buy a big anticipated dip."

2021-05-12 23:23:59,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre right about inflation reducing the value of currency rather than assets. The problem is that raising rates causes a rush of money from equity to bonds in proportion to the rise in the risk free rate aka the treasury bond. So which stonks tumble first? Well the ones with the negative 4 digit PE ratios. You know, the ones we all compulsively buy weekly otm calls on? The reason these go first is because companies with shitty PEs can‚Äôt shoulder the increased interest expenses on their own. 

The outrageous Fed debt makes higher rates necessary though. But, as we said, raising the rates will cause the market to tank hard. So we as a country continue to print money. Which causes inflation. Which requires higher rates to correct. Yeah it‚Äôs a ticking time bomb. 

TL;DR Buy the dip on lumber."

2021-05-13 02:25:03,wallstreetbets,"The markets are trying to push an inflation narrative to keep wages low. Thing is places that have kept their wages low are unable to hire new workers due to the fact people refuse to work for $7.25. Only in places where the minimum is $15 are people filling vacancies, and that is still a tepid pace.

What is going on is the rise of prices is coming from the cost of trying to make sure that products get to consumers, and those are on skeleton crews too, so overtime is through the roof. So THAT cost gets passed to the consumer so they can keep their COVID profits.

The real damage this virus has done to our economy is about to appear. If anything, I'm starting to eyeball our GDP taking a poop soon, and this inflation issue goes bye-bye and stagnation becomes the status-quo. If people can't buy shit because they got no money, how is America's consumer economy going to survive? The chickens have finally come home to roost.

The money should be going into companies that have been keeping their workers happy. When it comes to looking to going for future investments, look at companies that are going to be going forward with a large worker base that has good support, as it is known that a company that treats it's workers well end up seeing their wages return as those workers do business with that company.

There is a change in the wind coming and it's going to be massive, and those who have their sails ready will be sailing to Port Tendies."

2021-05-13 04:26:57,wallstreetbets,"Stocks are financial assets, not real assets. Stock value is in currency. If nothing changes within the company, noone wants to sell nor buy, the stock price will remain the same resulting in loss of value due to inflation.

There are companies who might lose or gain profit due to inflation, so investors might sell or buy their stock, therefore resulting in loss, profit or remain net zero, but this is a secondary effect of inflation on stock price.

Moving from one type of financial asset to other (or physical) during raise of inflation is a way of experience traders to profit on the inflation, or at least not lose gains made so far. If You don't know better and want to gain some % in the long run, buying the dip is reasonable. Bear in mind that institutions moving assets here and there due to inflation would not result in general market downtrend. Inflation is not the cause nor effect of market crash, it's collateral. So beware of buying the dip which will turn out not to be the dip."

2021-05-13 05:39:07,wallstreetbets,"The best way to combat inflation is to retain valuable assets, such as houses in good locations in good metropolises. Hold as little cash as possible and make some beneficial investments in time, but you must avoid stocks. The current virtual currency is also very unbearable. You can invest in heavy metals, especially gold, or buy some hedge funds. A more direct method is to short the currency. This is the most direct way to hedge against inflation, which can allow you to get a lot of benefits, and even make your wealth several times.  
The Fed will raise interest rates soon. In any era, only smart people can discover and fight risks in time, and become people who survive and even develop in crises. You should act quickly and don't let your property disappear for no reason."
2021-05-13 06:03:32,wallstreetbets,"My two cents:

You're putting it all in the same bag - not all equities are the same.

This may already be here - but inflation makes your expected future cash flows be discounted at a higher rate. 

To this, you can say ""But if there is more money in circulation then those cash flows should also be higher than today's projections"". I believe in here it will depend on the nature of the inflation - if it's demand/supply balance at the primary and secondary sectors of the economy putting pressure in a cycle of price increases + a fragile economy full of financial holes that will burst if money/debt becomes more expensive, then money should move imo from speculative markets to value stocks and known businesses that show results today.

If we are going to experience a market crash or a long bear market or even something else, nobody knows. But for sure it will be very interesting and an opportunity."

My thoughts are that the stimulus cheques will not continue forever, people will have to go back to work which will fix a lot of the supply issues, businesses will not raise wages when there is uncertainty in the market and I do believe people will just not pay the higher prices on things we don‚Äôt need."

2021-05-13 10:22:53,wallstreetbets,"I think the issue is that this inflation isn't new. It's been growing for the past 8 years as the Fed had kept the money faucets turned on and rates at all time lows. It's been somewhat invisible to the public because it's been completely trapped in the stock market (aka a bubble). Now that consumer inflation is starting to catch up people are starting to notice inflation and talk about inflation and, panicky monkeys that we are, we're starting to worry about the bubble bursting. A bubble stock (nearly all green energy stocks, for example) are not an asset. They were bought purely on speculation and the dream of getting on the elevator at the ground floor and riding it all the way to the top. Now we see and feel that the elevator is going down and if you didn't get off already there's no telling where the bottom is. So people are trying to move their money into safer investments like blue chips. That's why the Dow has continued to trend up MoM but our spec stock heavy portfolios that were booming last year are starting to dry up. Just my take on the situation."

After all an average major league pitcher‚Äôs fastball takes less than a second, a mere fraction of a second from when it leaves the pitcher‚Äôs hand to when it crosses the plate.

Unless the company is in the consumer good space and people are going to be buying less of them or you don't adjust your selling price to match inflation, the company should be doing the same as before inflation."

It‚Äôs less painful and less of a political issue to have inflation rather than having poor economy, Biden nor Powell wouldn‚Äôt allow it and certainly their corporate friends wouldn‚Äôt allow it. I think they will keep interest rates low and allow inflation to happen sort of kick the can down to next generation to handle the mess. Also it‚Äôs easier for them to downplay inflation by hiding the numbers etc plus inflation takes a long time to be felt, whereas if economy gets a hit the low employment numbers and other data shows up right away and politicians don‚Äôt like to face it.

Bonds are units of debt. Meaning when they are rising, they're being sold. Normally, when cash moves out of the debt market it moves into stocks. Using today as an example.. We have have bonds rates going up along with the markets dropping. Cash is flowing into cash.

The answer to your question is, cash doesn't stay in cash for long, especially when it's reason for going into cash is inflation (meaning when cash is devaluing). This cash is gonna go somewhere once it wakes up and smells the coffee.

Where? My bets are known inflation hedging assests. This would not be the first example of this. History is chalk full of cash fueled with fears of inflation and where it typically ends up. If rates rise due to inflation fears.. we'll see everything selloff. What will bounce back and potentially reach new highs in that scenario? You guessed it, inflationary hedges.

Ofcourse, this play would not be for the fearful or hesitant."

inflation could easily get to 10-20% since we hand out money like candy on halloween. The only powerful tool the fed has to combat this is to increase interest rates. The usa has a more vested interest in keeping the value of it's currency stable so it's global dominance doesn't falter than it does in printing money.

The fed not giving any indication that they'll raise rates is based on the assumption that things are going to quickly return back to normal. Surprise! Ain't shit going back to normal for a while. Coronavirus doesn't give any shits and everyone milking covid relief money would rather sit at home than go back to work. Plus dozens of other reasons.

2021-05-13 10:15:45,wallstreetbets,"The fed can't realy do anything at this point but raise taxes to  combat inflation. If they raise interest rates companies that are highly leveraged will tank. So instead they will print money and devalue the currency. Put it this way. If the govt prints money to spur spending that isn't backed by the creation of value, all existing dollars are dilluted by the amount of money they print. This is because the majority of what people buy comes from the labor of other countries. Alot of our major foreign debt holders are moving slowly away from the dollar and this will decrease the demand for dollars. As demand decreases the purchasing power of the dollar goes down. 

The current raise in prices is due to massive money printing and the fact that people aren't working so goods are harder to get. I don't think prices will continue to rise at the rate they have been so far this year. But they will keep rising more than 2,2% like the fed is predicting.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

# SPY 5/12 Recap - Bearish - Neutral

* Broke through the 410 put wall and tested near the gap fill top line before bouncing to close. 
* 20 SMMA failed.
* **Note midterm support range  that could come into play if SPY breaks 400 in the near to midterm \[393, 387, 380, 378\]. This is where SPY could test the 60 SMMA.** 
* **Bears need to still break 400. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a bounce tomorrow but Bulls need to reclaim 410-412 support for a recovery. Look for resistance @ 410.**

Note:

* Steady downtrend failed and bears broke the 244.7m possibility.
* OBV fell below a major level @ 237.1m.
* **Could see more selling pressure in the AM and a bounce @ 233.83m line. But will it be a ""dead cat"" as pointed out from first week of March or a rally?**
* **We could see downwards pressure to 218.8m line in Friday or early next week if indeed a dead cat bounce.**

* Broke put wall range and filled gap and hit short term bearish pt. 
* **Bears need to keep downward pressure towards the area of interests where a small gap could be filled \[306, 303, 301, 298\]**
* **Be care full with a bear trap slip past the 60 SMMA support as highlighted in March. We could see some slippage and recovery. Keep an eye out.**   
* **Bears need to keep resistance at 320 short term and 324**
* **Bulls need to break top resistance 324 and reclaim support area 326-330.**

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD - The Case to Buy Gold (XAU, $GOLD, $NEM) **The Headline:**

I expect gold to inflect over the next 6-12 months as the market begins to price the risk of a stagflationary post-COVID recovery. I don't have a formal price target, but one could expect the price of gold to possibly rise 50-100% from here under this scenario ($2700-3600). Positioning, consensus investor commentary, and sentiment indicators all suggest very few market participants are betting on this outcome, despite the fact that we are starting to see real signs of this thesis play out. That limits the downside and makes this bet asymmetric. Expect incremental catalysts over the next few months as the macro data confirm the thesis.

I recommend positioning either through physical gold ETFs or through gold miner stocks ($GOLD, $NEM), which offer a leveraged return on the hard commodity.

**The Setup:**

At the moment, rates markets (and gold prices) are priced for post-COVID reflation and a traditional Fed normalization cycle. In other words, they are taking what the Fed says at face value: current inflationary pressures are transitory, GDP and employment will recover together in the traditional sense, closing the output gap, allowing the Fed to gradually hike rates towards the terminal rate over the next few years\*. I do not subscribe to this scenario. I believe the Fed will be faced with a dilemma that they haven't been faced with since the 1970s: inflation is rising (as a result of artificially stimulated demand and excess savings, in conjunction with supply bottlenecks), while frictions in the labor market are leading to a very slow (or nonexistent) recovery. When faced with this dilemma, I believe the Fed will cave to political pressure and choose to postpone rate hikes until employment recovers. In doing so, the price of money will collapse, inducing a selloff of the dollar and surge in demand for gold.

*\* swap markets are pricing in 1 rate hike by 4Q22, and 4 hikes by 4Q23, while 5y5y treasury forwards are at the Fed's terminal rate of 2.5%.*

**So How Does This All Work?**

*Part I: The Labor Market*

The labor market will be slow to recover. Because of this, the supply side of the economy will not be able to meet its demand (which has more or less already returned to pre-COVID levels). Hence all the news we've seen recently about production and labor shortages. This type of supply/demand mismatch has, and will continue to, generate inflationary pressures.

So why will the labor market be slow to recover?

First, because unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus have replaced the incomes of the labor supply, in most cases granting them incomes beyond what they normally would have made in the labor market. I have included an infographic from CNBC demonstrating such an issue with the first stimulus package in 2020. Amazingly, despite widely distributed vaccines and progress on reopening, the Biden administration passed an additional $1.9trn stimulus package (CARES Act) that more or less sustained these income benefits. Many of these additional unemployment benefits won't expire until end of September 2021, delaying the time at which people will start thinking about working again.

https://preview.redd.it/ffkmflfndry61.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5ffd10757120e97eaa3e4db6492294b99bb6fd7

Second, the pandemic has transformed the economy, for better or worse. Many of the pre-pandemic jobs will never come back. There is likely a significant amount of skills-mismatch in the labor market today, which will require a lot of time for people to re-train and/or find work in new industries. Traditionally, this type of labor slack would be deflationary (unemployed people aren't making money, so they can't contribute to economic growth), but I will explain why this may not be the case this time in the next section.

*Part II: Demand From Excess Savings and Government Spending*

So if the labor market is weak, why should demand run strong? In large part because US consumers have a massive war chest to deploy and spend, after receiving so many fiscal transfers during the pandemic. These savings, through February 2020, are large enough to replace 12% of annual consumer spending. Note that this does NOT include the CARES act, which allocated another $610bn for consumers! These factors have pushed consumption back to pre-COVID levels despite unemployment still elevated. I would expect this dynamic to continue for many more months, as people draw down from savings to spend on pent-up demand.

Second is that the economy is not entirely run by the private sector. There is another agent, the government, that generates demand. And boy, Biden really wants to spend. His infrastructure plan is estimated to be worth $2.3trn, and his American Families Plan at an estimated $1.8trn. This is absolutely unprecedented - to be spending that much money at a time when the economy is already running hot! The CBO estimates that the fiscal deficit may reach a whopping $3.4trn in 2021, which is $300bn HIGHER than it was in 2020!! That's almost 30% of GDP between 2020-2021.

*Part III: Undermining the Credibility of the Dollar*

All of these actions have the end result of undermining the credibility of the dollar as a reserve currency:

\- Budget deficit of 15% GDP in 2021

\- Trade deficit of 10% GDP

\- Negative real rates with rising inflation

\- weak potential growth

\- an overvalued stock market

\- a reckless monetary/fiscal policy combination

\- and the currency is expensive on a REER basis relative to long-term history

When people distrust the dollar, they flee.

We've already seen that in the form of massive inflow into digital currencies. Some worry that digital currencies will replace gold. But these are a risk assets, while gold is a safe haven. They go up when people feel good, and gold goes up when people feel bad. In this type of stagflationary environment, I would expect these flows to redirect into gold.

**Where is the Opportunity?**

Buy gold, and buy the gold miners.

The chart below shows that all of the pandemic-induced flows into gold funds has since been taken out, as a result of renewed confidence in the economic recovery, an expectation that the Fed will normalize interest rates, and that while dollar weakness may be in the cards down the road, we don't have to worry about it now because the economy will be ripping.

I hope I've demonstrated to you why this thesis will fail, and why gold will be ripe for inflection.

2021-05-12 22:30:18,wallstreetbets,"Excellent question! When the inflation print came out there was a bit of a battle around how it should be interpreted:

One interpretation (the current market prevailing bias, the interpretation that won out) is that because it‚Äôs widely expected that the labor market will recover swiftly, higher inflation adds conviction to the view that the Fed will hike according to schedule. This is what happened. Inflation breakevens up, real rates up, nominal yields up, gold down, dollar stronger.

The OTHER interpretation (which I think will become more evident in the months ahead) is that because the labor market recovery is WEAK, higher inflation will only pressure real rates as the Fed stands pat. Inflation breakevens up, real rates down, nominal yields up/flat/down (depending on the magnitude), gold up, dollar weakens!"
2021-05-12 23:01:27,wallstreetbets,"Interesting take... Thank you.  The only point in your interpretation that I tend to disagree with is the labor market recovery.  Industries across sectors have more and more jobs available, and are struggling to fill positions.  Until unemployment benefits are brought back to realistic levels, this will remain a challenge.  But the labor market itself is reconvening rapidly, albeit hindered by the political landscape.  Thanks again"
2021-05-12 23:23:06,wallstreetbets,"Yes but that‚Äôs exactly the point!

The DEMAND for labor is strong (because the demand for goods and services is strong). But the recovery in the SUPPLY of labor has not been robust. One part unemployment benefits (which expire at the end of September), one part the usual recessionary displacement of labor.

Net-net: HIGHER than expected unemployment rate, for longer than expected, HIGHER than expected inflation, for longer than expected

Market questions the feds ability to achieve its dual mandate"
2021-05-13 00:09:36,wallstreetbets,"So unemployment benefits end in September and aren't renewed, lazy assholes.go back to work.

What then? Massive demand suddenly filled by massive supply? Doesn't that invalidate the thesis?"
2021-05-13 07:14:15,wallstreetbets,"Well it's not just about the benefits, but also the permanent damage that has been incurred on the labor market due to the recession.  There were 23.3mm people unemployed in April 2020.  Since then, that number has come down to 9.8mm.  So there were 13.3mm people who were previously unemployed and either now have a job again or have exited the workforce.

The vast majority of the recent recovery in the labor market has been from people who were temporarily furloughed (and thus the transition back to employment was much easier).  Those who were unemployed ""temporarily"" dropped from 18.0mm last year to just 2.1mm today, a whopping +15.9mm people!  This part of the recovery was easy and will not ever be repeated again.

Interestingly, those who are classified as permanently employed have in fact not recovered at all!  That number has stayed flat at around 4.2-4.3mm people since the beginning of the year.

And lastly, the labor force participation rate remains 1.5-2% below pre-COVID levels, at around 61.7%.

To continue to see gains in employment, you need to hire those who are permanently unemployed, and those who exited the labor market, tasks which take much longer (generally years!).

Usually, weakness in employment aligns with weakness in demand, so there is no inflation problem when we recover from recessions.  This time, we will see excess demand from both the private sector (people have excess savings and benefits to support their incomes, which supports demand despite not having a job) AND government spending (Biden's spending binge)."

With how low this is being kept I can‚Äôt see the move to 15 and the resulting gamma happening. Maybe 12.5 would create enough pressure to get the job done. Would still be over 15 million shares worth of contracts."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Tamp Down team, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Plunge Protection Team has London operations. The LBMA pulls off the greatest spoof in the history of trading - 124 million oz of silver to spook the May contract longs. JP Morgan's criminal enterprise spoofing operation is child's play. 

Five times each year Comex futures enters a period of drama as the large contracts (January, May, July, September and December) approach first notice day. It is a display of the paper charade that Comex silver and gold markets are. With only a few weeks to first notice day there are 5 or 6 times as many contracts open as the entire metal available for delivery as registered stocks. And just because it is in the vault doesn‚Äôt mean the shorts hold title to the bars, so the key ratio is likely far higher than 5 or 6.

The drama plays out over 3 weeks as many traders either roll their position to a forward month or close their position. Only a fraction stand for delivery. With only a week to go, there are still typically about 3 times as many open contracts as metal in the vault.

This must be a stressful situation for those short silver or whose goal is to ‚Äútamp down‚Äù precious metals markets. The metals ‚ÄúTamp Down Team"" is a fully owned subsidiary of the ‚ÄúPlunge Protection Team‚Äù.

Let‚Äôs digress to routine day to day trading in the futures market. JP Morgan was found by the CFTC to be a criminal enterprise from their spoofing operation. From Reuters:

‚ÄúBetween 2008 and 2016, JPMorgan engaged in a pattern of manipulation in the precious metals futures and U.S. Treasury futures market, the CFTC said. Traders would place orders on one side of the market which they never intended to execute, to create a false impression of buy or sell interest that would raise or depress prices, according to the settlement.‚Äù

[https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325](https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325)

JP Morgan was fined by the CFTC for nearly $1 billion for spoofing the market ‚Ä¶ creating the illusion of supply or demand to manipulate the market.

The LBMA spoofed on the grandest scale in history. They created the illusion of an instant appearance of 124 million oz of silver, in essence a sell order.

First, the LBMA changed their reporting schedule. Normally they report stocks on a one month lag however on March 5, the LBMA changed the lag to just 5 business days. This enabled them to publish new vault numbers BEFORE the roll period of the May contract. If the 30 day lag was used, the published stocks report would be after first notice day of the May contract and would not impact investor psychology or actions.

The subsequent announcement of the stocks report occurred on April 9 just as the roll from the May contract started.  The LBMA titled its press release as ‚ÄúRecord stocks of Silver in London Vaults‚Äù to make the biggest splash possible.

If you held a May silver futures contract long position and thought the silver market was getting tight, would it be unnerving to see 124 million oz suddenly appear in the LBMA vault as ‚Äúrecord stocks‚Äù? An investor could easily think that if 124 million oz can be added in this month, then maybe more could be added next month.

Note the timing of the LBMA reporting change annoucement and the initial ""record stocks"" press release superimposed on the May contract timeline shown below. The ""record stocks"" report occurred immediately before the critical weeks before first notice date.



Then on May 10, the LBMA issued a statement that effectively retracted nearly all of the ‚Äúrecord stocks‚Äù. They stated the revised stock levels although they didn't use the word ""revised"".  And it only admitted its ‚Äúerror‚Äù in a footnote:

\*A data submission error led to the publication of an incorrect aggregate figure for the total silver held in London vaults in March. The corrected figure is 1,143,194 Troy ounces ('000s).

[https://www.lbma.org.uk/articles/london-gold-and-silver-vault-holdings-end-april-2021](https://www.lbma.org.uk/articles/london-gold-and-silver-vault-holdings-end-april-2021)

And just like that, the spoof was cancelled!

The metals markets manipulation has now gone to a new level. There are many indications that the metals market charade is under duress. I think this may be the sharpest signal yet.

If you haven't heard of the ""Tamp Down Team"", it was recently revealed by the Mr. Rostin Brehnam, acting Chairman of the CFTC:

2021-05-13 06:39:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but there's no tamp down team or whatever the fuck.  Just like the plunge protection team is an old dated conspiracy theory on why markets always go up.   Invoking these doesn't help your cause.  

Besides, you don't need some tamp protection team, or whatever bullahit.   Big, greedy banks will do.  Silver is beat to death because JPMorgan is custodian for SLV and they run a ckntinual scalp on SLV as they know that the vast majority of silver trades are paper, and because they fucking can.  No secretive government agencies.   Just a pretty damn smart continual scalp trade."
2021-05-12 21:27:32,wallstreetbets,"So, only one time?  And they improved inventory discovery by 25 days?  How is this negative?  When should they have made this major improvement?  July?

The silver army is now armed for the future with more current data.  THIS IS GOOD.  Regardless of if you like silver or not.

The silver squeeze wasn't going to happen in May, there was too much silver in COMEX, London would just declare force majeur and you'd get like a $3 pop (really no idea, but nothing crazy) while boats got loaded with silver to cross the Atlantic.

What you are missing with your short term view, is that if the conditions were ever right, whales can now be more certain than ever as the reporting lag is 25 days less.  You'd need someone like the Hunt Brothers to cause the mega spike.  IMO it's stupid, just let silver be an industrial commodity again, nobody uses it as money anymore.

Ignore the timing, this without a doubt is improved discovery.  This is progress and whomever has conspiracies about manipulation now has a far quicker view of actual conditions.  This is a long term market positive, 100%.

Note: could care less about silver and the price, big fan of quicker reporting of anything.

Good luck with your trades, this has not changed the fundamentals, just gives you quicker access to data.  If the fundamentals are setup like silver bulls believe, it just provided a temporary sale for further stacking."

2021-05-12 23:01:58,wallstreetbets,"That's the point of this post.  A squeeze very likely could have occurred if in fact this is true.  JPM operates in a large silver vault in London.  This accounting ""error"" dates back to when Silver popped $3, but didn't continue because it appeared there was enough demand. 

JPM is also the custodian of SLV- which had massive inflows.  They potentially couldn't source silver at the market price (even up $3), and even changed their prospectus in the days after to note that they may night buy the metals. 

If any thing this raises the question of  was this error actually fraud - fraud that was caused by paper reporting of silver that didn't exists.  Silver that SLV was unable to source, and thus in a natural market would be required to be sourced at a higher and higher price (a squeeze)..."

Different industries. Different obligations. Different solvency/debt levels. Different projections. Different leadership. Different market circumstances.

I can go into details, if you want?

But the premise is that - ironically - everything that WSB believes that is bad about GME is ... ... Well... it's actually AMC.

But AMC gets a free pass from wsb for what reason? Lol.

I think the bear case behind GME is worth considering... but only in the *short term*. The fact is, the company is in a **perfect** place to dominate the market segment it wants to breach into.

That's a pretty substantial *rumour* to buy on.

AMC isn't changing anything, the CEO himself said revenue will only reach 2019 levels... in 202**3**. Thats a long way out, meanwhile GME is already likely going to beat its own projections in Q1 2021.

&#x200B;

CashÔºöBurned 83% of cash from the last Q4. Figure out usage

Current AssetÔºöcan observe a minor decrease in operating cycle turnover. Inventory up, receivables up.

\* Total/long term asset:  88% of long term asset is formed of goodwill and intangible. CATA = 0.49

The current ratio is ok, but we will get back to the liquidity problem later.

\*Total liability is greater than total assets. might be at risk of default if sales drop

\*gross profit margin dropped to 18% from 27%

Operating expense increase due to increase in G&A which is normal for new listings

\*Net profit dropped 96% 

\*NPM dropped to 1.17% from 16.8%

Interest expense / Operating Income increase to 69.6% from 5.05%. This is not even sustainable unless there is a one-time interest payment. I didn't find anything in Notes.

Cash FLOW:

\* In two consecutive periods: Cash dropped from 361257  to 102821 to 19133. The company has no cash left for future operations because of deferred revenue.

Adjusted EBITDA is 34452, comparing to 13052. Still down 68.8%

Adjust NI down 71%

I started to build a little today which is a horrible mistake. I don't know if I'm going to sell but I certainly won't buy more."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC and What's Happening: An Explanation of Rule 10B Hello, so as you can imagine UWMC flew to the moon on a day where the market shit the bed. So, what happened? We're seeing the beginning of a huge squeeze in the very early stages. I'm just going to go through a factual explanation and some numbers.

On the earnings call yesterday, the CEO of UWMC (Matt Ishbia) stated that they would start the buyback starting tomorrow pending the rules.

What rules are there for stock buybacks? Well, the relevant one is Rule 10B, and they regulate stock buybacks. Why is this important?

Well, UWMC had an over 15% short interest, and that was recorded for April 30th. After RKT's earnings on the 5th, and LDI's on the 3rd of May, and looking at UWMC's share price tank after these two reported earnings... We can well imagine that the short interest increased since then.

Let's discuss what's going on then first shall we. Rule 10B is a safe harbor provision for stock manipulation in regards to buybacks, and if you follow them you're generally safe. One of these requirements is in regards to how many shares you're allowed to purchase on a given day. That number is 25% of the average daily volume. The average moving volume for UWMC right now is 5.64 Million, which means that UWMC could have bought up to 1.41 Million Shares worth of Stock.  Volume today was 8.91 Million. That means that there could have been up to an extra 3.27 Million Shares of additional volume? My guess is that it's a mix of hedge fund bulls who smell blood in the water, and momentum traders from WSB or more generally.

What does that all mean however? Well, usually there is volatility crush after Earnings, but UWMC remained highly volatile after earnings with a IV above 100%. That, combined with the massive amount of buys today means that the interest rates to borrow shares have mooned from 3-5% to 34.9% per annum. That's a huge increase. However, the shares available to short according to IBorrowdesk has actually gone down significantly. What that means is that the shorters are still in the game, so to speak.

Some of you are wondering what happened from 3:45PM onwards, and there's actually an explanation for that too, and it's rooted in Rule 10B.   Under Rule 10B companies with higher average trading volume or public float value can trade until the last 10 minutes. The shorters in the stock thus felt safe enough to borrow more shares to try to bring down the shares. If you see on IBorrowdesk the available shares went down from 2,000 to 800, before bouncing back to 3,000. So someone drove the stock down, then covered slightly or his position completely.

So, what's going to happen now? The short percentage is still sky high, and they haven't budged. Well, here's the thing. The public float is 110 Million, but of that there is a decent percentage that are institutional buyers. UWMC can buy up to 1.41 Million of that a day (which costs them only 9 million dollars a day!), and as the daily moving average moves up, they can start buying more and more. Those shares are retired, and thus cannot be bought back by shorters to cover. Furthermore, there are institutional buyers, and sophisticated traders who will want to get into the action (conceivably) because they see the way this is going. Finally, the ex dividend date is June 10th and if they refuse to cover their liable to have to pay the dividend to the owners of the shares. Finally, interest rate will continue to skyrocket upward pressuring them to cover or else get liquidated. At 2% a year, shorting UWMC even with its dividend was feasible, but to short UWMC with a 100+ interest rate is going to just destroy them. Especially when they additionally have to cover the shares they sold short.

In conclusion, the match has been lit (in my opinion), and the fuse will blow sooner or later. One one hand, UWMC retiring shares, and on the other hand, buyers driving up the price and then holding.

Edit: This also means that UWMC can squeeze the shorters with a buy back, while maintaining inclusion in the Russel by the way!"
2021-05-12 21:25:29,wallstreetbets,"It will be interesting to see how this plays out. Lack of public float + buyback authorization for half of the limited float + heavy retail interest will be lovely when Q2 prints. Expecting a banner Q2 because of the CEO's ultimatim of UWM or RKT, and most went with UWM."

This is why you don't short a cash rich company that makes boatloads of money lol."
2021-05-13 04:14:21,wallstreetbets,More shares can be shorted than issued.  Soooo.  But I think this could make a move north $10
2021-05-12 23:29:23,wallstreetbets,"One thing to note speaking as someone who has run a corporate share buyback, the share buyback is limited to 25% of the average trading volume for the last 6 months prior to filing for the share buyback, corporates are also allowed 1 block trade per week which can exceed the 25% daily limit, most corporates will pick a $ value per day and have the broker execute to target daily VWAP, you likely won‚Äôt see much impact on share price from this unless they are maxing the 25% daily and picking up a sizeable block per week, just some food for thought this will take some time to have a noticeable impact"

And it did not fucking fly to the moon today, it was up 8% after being down almost 20% over the past 90 days and down 27% on the year, for fuck sake. Go away and deal with your heavy bags.

2021-05-12 21:22:43,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôll pick a price for the buy back and stop there... that may be $7.5.. $7.. $8... I doubt much higher than 8.. they won‚Äôt go chasing this for a ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù they want stability at a higher price then it was at earnings time... if it squeezes it‚Äôll be back at the price they choose to set their buy wall at. Also they can only buy like 20m shares I believe to still have Russell inclusion on June 25th. So chances are they‚Äôre not going all in on a squeeze.

2021-05-12 22:06:16,wallstreetbets,It doesn't need to get anywhere near 12.5 to start a gamma squeeze. 9.01 is the magic number here.... it just needs to get there and stay there long enough that MM have to hedge. But I can almost promise there's gonna be a huge sell wall throughout the 8s but especially the upper 8s.
2021-05-13 00:00:07,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs variable/adjustable - they apply the rate to whatever you already have borrowed in addition to new borrows.

2021-05-13 00:03:15,wallstreetbets,It has already been stated that they can buy back about 45 million shares at $6.50. What hasn't been stated is even if this jumps back up and they pay an average of $10 a stock they can still retire 30 million shares or about 1/3rd of the float. Bullish as hell!

other hand, buyers driving up the price and then holding."
2021-05-12 22:11:10,wallstreetbets,"Your correct, they won't chase a squeeze by any means... but... they don't have to. They just need to place a solid buy wall so shorts can't beat us into the the ground.. there have got to be shorts that are underwater right now... between them covering and retail... it's possible."
2021-05-12 21:59:17,wallstreetbets,It's been the opposite of the market for a while now. The market had been killing it the last few months while UWMC dropped from nearly $14 to below $7 this week

2021-05-12 21:24:00,wallstreetbets,"6.66 is my average price on 31,500 shares.."
2021-05-13 09:05:22,wallstreetbets,"Previous high was about $14 in late December. I think that's where a lot of shorts are holding positions. There was a nice jump to 12.5 in March -- I also think there are a lot of shorts between $10 - 14. Conveniently that jump in March was 6 days before the ex-dividend date on very high volume. Likely some serious covering to avoid shorts paying the dividend. It's not outrageous to think that would happen again late May/early June.

Fundamentally I think that this stock is sound too for long term holding. 5% yield with a P/B < 1.  Great income growth numbers in Q1."

2021-05-12 21:04:25,wallstreetbets,"It's limited to one purchase a day?  I don't think so.  Total volume is limited, yes.  They will hand whatever desk they use an order, but it will be multiple purchases over multiple fills.  I.e. buy today up to 7.50 and up to 1 million shares and the desk may finesse the order for best fills and maybe maxed out on shares with an average fill price of 7.10, tomorrow might be the same instructions again and perhaps none are filled because it trades above 7.50 all day.  This cycle will repeat as long as the price is below whatever UWMC sees as a good use of capital or until their purchasing power runs out. 

I don't know what that number is in their directors/execs mind (and the price and volume may change as market conditions and internal forecasted profits change) maybe 8 or 9?  At prices above their internal figure they may reserve dry powder to buy on further weakness or reduce debt.

Their dividend yield at today's close was 5.95%.  Dividends are after tax.  The yield on their recently issued debt (before tax), was 5.5%.  If management is confident, expect them to put a priority on reducing their most expensive capital which is dividends, and balance it with some debt reduction."

2021-05-12 20:04:23,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you understand how day trading works.  This has nothing to do with margin interest.

So say you have an account with $100k cash and nothing else (and that cash was there overnight -- not deposited today)  Your intraday buying power is $400k. You can buy $400k worth of stock while the market is open.

However, Reg T only allows the broker to let you open new positions totalling  200% of your account value.  But this is only enforced overnight.  That means that you need to sell off some of your position before the day is over to get your account into compliance, otherwise tomorrow morning you will get a federal (Reg T) margin call.

This is why if you have a margin account you will see two different buying powers -- overnight buying power and intraday buying power.  What day traders generally do is exit all their positions before the market closes so that they will have maximum intraday buying power the next day (the buying power is 4x the cash you had at the end of the day -- if you hold positions overnight they don't conribute to the following day's intraday buying power).

So true day traders never hold a position overnight.  They begin and end each day with 100% cash."

I'm not going to dig in my heels about the shares, because ultimately it's not conducive to a productive conversation.

I will say this though. The new daily moving average is up to 6.4M from yesterday, but within 55 minutes of opening bell there has already been 2.16 Million in volume representing 34% of the moving average. 

The fee to borrow shares is going to pop. This is because the volume and IV are way up.

It's not completely clear to me exactly how this is calculated.  I actually called the fully paid lending phone number when I signed up and the guy told me that I wouldn't be able to calculate it.  They get some third party data, which is an average of what different brokers are charging, or something like that, and they pay me 60% of that fee.

I assume that the numbers that they are averaging is what brokers charge each other, not what they charge customers (There must be a markup there, otherwise a borrow desk would not be motivated to look for shares if they don't have them in their own inventory).

I should buy a few shares on IBKR and see what they pay me to borrow them (their policy is to pay 50%)"

With that said. It's now 10:46 and volume is at 3.06 for the day representing 47.8% of the daily moving average. It's only been an hour and fifteen minutes roughly from when I started typing this. There is still 5 hours and 15 minutes before we move into After Hours. The more volume there is day after day that's higher than the daily moving average, the higher the daily moving average goes, and the more UWMC will be able to buy back day after day. It's still worth it to them to buy back at this yield as well.

I know a few people are going on about options activity and the possibility of a gamma squeeze, but this is an area where i don't know much and so I won't presume to talk about it."
2021-05-13 10:52:46,wallstreetbets,I would not assume that they will buy the max that they are allowed.  Did you listen to the CC?
2021-05-13 11:00:59,wallstreetbets,"I did. But you have to remember their only able to buy 25% of the average volume. At 6.40M that's 1.6M shares. 1.6\*7.5=12M. Yesterday was roughly 9 Million. Yield at this price is over 5.3%. It makes absolute sense for them to buy at this rate. Assuming they buy the max they can the last two days, they've only spend 21M of their 300M. The call was about not blowing the 300 million in one go (which their not even allowed to do).

It makes sense from an operations standpoint to retire shares, even now with the runup. Furthermore, while Matt said they weren't going to blow their load in one go, considering how much his networth has increased over the last 2 days, the 21M investment is a pittance. 

Considering Rule 10B, to retire 60M dollars worth of shares would take them roughly a trading week accounting for exponential growth in the average volume. They are capped at what they can buy per day, and so that caps their daily dollar investment. 

Remember a dollar in share price increase nets Matt over 1B dollars in NW. It makes sense for him personally, and for his shareholders generally, to buy back at these prices."
2021-05-13 11:16:08,wallstreetbets,"The money is authorized to be spent over the next 2 years.

He said that they were paying attention to the float.  There is no way that are maxing it out.

This has absolutely nothing to do with Mat's net worth.  It's not his personal money that is being spent, it's company money.  And yes his net worth goes up on paper but that's a meaningless number.  He can't actually sell all those shares at that price.  Liquidity is important here.

Also the buyback really won't increase the share price that much.  You are paying too much attention to the float and not enough to the total outstanding shares (including class D).  Spending $300B on buybacks is worth about $0.20 / share in actual value (because each share is now worth a slighly later percentage of the company).  It's not that different from paying the $300B as a $0.20 special dividend, except that it's taxed more beneficially.

You are thinking too much about supply and demand (which isn't really a factor except in the very short term) and ignoring value.  They may be price spikes but price discovery will get the price back to whatever the market thinks it's worth very quickly.  This (price discovery) is one of the main benefits of a liquid exchange."
2021-05-13 11:28:37,wallstreetbets,"So some things. One, i'm well aware that they keep hinting they want Russel inclusion. I don't much care since my goals are not mutually exclusive with theirs. they can buy roughly 16 percent to 20 percent of the float, and still make it into the Russel. Consider that in light of rule 10B and it will take them awhile to actually get there.

Two. I know him selling all his shares would tank the share price and i know there are 1.6B but only a float of 110M. But here's the thing. Rich people who have their wealth concentrated in a company usually borrow and use their shares as collateral, more often than not, because that way they can somewhat get fair value while at the same time not tank the price. 

Three, the buybacks are also to fight off the people selling the stock short. You're right that in the long term the people who short sell need to ultimately buy back the share to lock in their profit, but in the short term it absolutely hurts the share price after a certain percentage of the float. You know the share price is a reflection of supply and demand and if there's more people selling than buying it lowers the price, so in the short term they have been hammering the stock. 

CEO's, and especially owners, hate it when that happens. And so an announcement of this magnitude tells me that they want to at least set a floor, and in the earnings call they said they would start buying back on the 12th. They did, clearly, do so then. They aren't going to buy at 8.5-9, when they can buy at 7.5. 

I actually think the buyback enhances value in a very real way because of the cost savings in the dividend. To add to that I like the idea of a higher future EPS, and buying back at this price point is more economical than at 10 dollars, and it would be economical for them to buy back at 10 too. 

I'm well aware they need to also do buybacks for dilution, but the Class A for performance they are handing out are not that pricey considering the amount of shares they will be getting in 2022-2023-2024. 

I'm extremely bullish as you can likely tell. I think the buybacks are worth far more than .20 cents a share since Class A shares are the dividend shares and they provide 40 cents in yield alone. I also think UWMC has the chance to grow its dividend sometime this year, or next year too."
2021-05-13 11:50:37,wallstreetbets,"He can't sell all his shares.  They are class D, which are not traded anywhere.  They would have to be converted to class A.  If he were to sell them it would more likely be in a private deal.  It should not change the share price at all, because your class A share would be worth exactly the same percentage of the company as it was before. 

Buybacks are not to combat short sellers.  That's complete nonsense. Buybacks are just a way of returning cash to the shareholders, because it makes their shares worth a bigger percentage of the company.   Mat doesn't give a shit about short sellers.

You are really looking at this the wrong way.  The company has a certain value.  Your shares are nothing more than a piece of the company, so they have a piece of that value.  When shares are bought back and retired, your shares are worth a bigger piece.  That's it.

Also, since a share is a piece of the company, owning the share entitles you to a piece if the company's assets, including their cash.  This is true whether they pay that can as a dividend or not.  It's your money, because you own the company.  Dividends are not a cost.  It's more like a withdrawal.

I'm bullish as well because I feel that the company's future earnings and their current assets are worth more than its current market value, and that's all a company is (a way to generate earnings).   That's it.  Buybacks and dividends don't change that value; they just change how and when I capture those future earnings (which are mine since I own part of the company).  Once I no longer feel that the future earnings and current assets are worth more than the current price, I will no longer be bullish and I will sell my shares."
2021-05-13 12:47:42,wallstreetbets,"You're right about the conversion needing to happen, or that they'll likely be done in a private deal. With that said a larger float makes the company harder to move on lower volume, so I think that is something to note.

I'd like to actually refute your claim that buybacks can't combat short sellers. I'm actually going to go ahead and tell you two ways they do. The first is that you have to realize that if a company has over 10% of its float sold short it's a bearish indicator and it actually starts affecting the share price. After 20% it becomes material. (We still agree that the effect is short term/mid term, as opposed to long term as eventually they will buy back the shares to realize a profit). 

UWMC has been authorized to buy back 45% to roughly 33% of the share price (The 33% is if the share price was at 10 dollars). How does that affect short sellers? It increases the SI as a percentage of float because the float becomes smaller for one. It also adds buying pressure to meet the selling pressure. Third, it increases volume and IV, which increases the margin maintenance requirement for people who are selling short or who are buying on margin while simultaneously increasing the fee for shorter to borrow. Finally it increases the share price, forcing short sellers to consider cutting bait and locking in gains or continue in their attempt and risk a loss when they cover. Please note the dividend is additional pressure. So you're wrong in that buybacks cannot combat the short sellers in this instance.

As for the dividend. People who have their shares bought by the company no longer receive a dividend. That's the company saving money. As I am an owner in the company, I win too. While simultaneously owning a larger percentage of the company. Win-win. 

Hopefully I've explained why in this instance the buy back is organically squeezing the shorts."
2021-05-13 14:30:05,wallstreetbets,"sure, there might be a short squeeze. they do happen.  it's unlikely but anything is possible.

I just feel that every since GME people are seeing short squeezes in every stock, which is ridiculous.  They are extremely rare events.  This looks nothing like GME did pre-squeeze.  Even that stock took almost a year to squeeze at 120% SI.  People were noting the SI and low price in March and it didn't squeeze until the following January 

Anyway you are talking about price and I'm taking about value.  If there is a squeeze it will quickly crash when it's over.  I'll take it, of course, but I'm not counting on it.  I bought the stock because I think that the company is worth something in the $15-$20 per share range.  Obviously if it squeezes above that I'm happy to make even more on it but that would just be a bonus."
2021-05-13 16:46:37,wallstreetbets,"Well, you're right in that it's worth more. Institutional buying has gone up a lot starting from the 11th. You can check the 13F filings.

The thing is, I'm tired of the artificial suppression at this point."
2021-05-13 16:56:01,wallstreetbets,There is zero evidence of any artificial suppression.
2021-05-13 17:47:03,wallstreetbets,"Are we really going to act like it going to $6.23 after they announced a 300 million dollar buy back allowing it to buy roughly half the float was completely natural? Especially when you add the yield on top of that?

Furthermore, the calls bought way outweighed the puts for 5/21. They still do. If the strike is reached for 7.5, a lot of market makers are going to have to cover at a steep loss. 

Lastly, IV gets absolutely crushed after earnings, but the IV has remained at 90-110% since. It ended the day at 95%. That's not normal dude. At all.

The short interest was over 15%, and likely went way up after RKT's earnings. I'm  being honest here when I say I highly doubt all of this is normal, nor do i think most people would think so."
2021-05-13 18:44:52,wallstreetbets,"The price is what the market prices it at.  There is no evidence of any manipulation.  You don't know that MMs are short calls, and if they are you don't know that they aren't properly hedged.  It is extremely unlikely that the MMs lose money at any price point, because they know how to hedge a position.

The stock is making sharp moves; the IV looks about right to me.  If you think it's too high, sell some options.

Your have this crazy idea in your head about how the market works and you couldn't be more wrong.  Just because you think a stock should go up and it doesn't, it does not mean that there is manipulation.  It just means that you were wrong.  Accept it."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Terminal Velocity TL;DR Inflation's coming. Buy something tangible. 

Over the past two decades the velocity of money steadily declined with a precipitous drop over the past year. The velocity of money is the annual rate at which money is exchanged in an economy. 

https://preview.redd.it/ltejnndvxqy61.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=752eb4a2304200eb7409a600ce9a6d6911452f1c

Here's the quantity of money over the same time period. This series was recently discontinued. It's pretty scary.

https://preview.redd.it/8wljc0g9yqy61.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb6dfe13dd1e62028acb601a67943cd34fccd40e

From these two charts, one can calculate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by multiplying them. Basically, how much money there is times how often it is spent. 

This is *nominal* GDP. The difference between nominal and real GDP is equal to inflation. We got a nasty number on inflation today, the Consumer Price Index. Basically, everything costs more. Alternatively, dollars are worth less. 

The Jerome Powell, the Chairman of Federal Reserve Board of Governors, claims any inflation will be transitory. 

Maybe. But what if the velocity of money reverts to the pre-COVID trend or even goes back towards the long-term average of 1.8? We're screwed. 

I'm long REITs, commodities, and emerging market banks. My biggest positions are small precious metal miners. These asset classes do very well in inflationary times. 

The selloff today resulted from the market's being spooked by inflation, rightly so in my opinion. Find a safe harbor today as we're approaching terminal velocity."

2021-05-13 07:30:14,wallstreetbets,Or crack. After that first hit you are always chasing the high. I get much more satisfaction losing money on the market than i did smoking that crap.
2021-05-12 21:48:27,wallstreetbets,I think you doing it right?
2021-05-13 00:04:15,wallstreetbets,Noticed all the big players profit taking in the techs and decided to bet on the decline

So it could go sideways, but then again the weekend is coming up and big players don‚Äôt like to hold over the weekend when the market is like this. Could sell hard at the very end"
2021-05-13 00:04:35,wallstreetbets,Thanks! I like it here

2021-05-13 04:27:51,wallstreetbets,Be care with the next trades. You could give them back sooner than you think
2021-05-12 22:52:03,wallstreetbets,Nice when did you buy
2021-05-13 04:23:53,wallstreetbets,How much premium did you pay on all of those?
2021-05-13 09:21:56,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not pizza
2021-05-13 09:06:59,wallstreetbets,Because they just hit a new ath 20min earlier.  Obvious it would drop.  Quick day trade for some lunch money.

2021-05-13 02:25:07,wallstreetbets,Lol!!!  I only let them expire if I‚Äôm holding them for spite against the universe.  You should be selling them way way before them expire (at least I lose less money when I do that)
2021-05-13 09:39:57,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why you sell them instead of buying them üòÄ
2021-05-13 17:54:19,wallstreetbets,Try selling options rather than buying.

2021 projected revenue at 3Billion

Market Cap at $3B with current price at $22.

Current Assets $1.3Billion

Long Term Debt $6B (not attractive)

Not profitable at this moment

# Why is this so attractive?

HIGH Target for acquisition. IF someone acquires and optimize SGA&E expenses, that's $1.4B in savings! those are controllable expenses that the acquiring company can put in control and cut cost my merging the backend operation such as legal/marketing/finance/HR. 50% reduction would be ideal! This will make the business profitable. Digital AD revenue is growing at a double digit growth!

2021-05-12 22:00:18,wallstreetbets,"It's required for level 4 autonomy, which TSLA does not currently have... The current prevailing technology capable of providing the required sensor range is solely made by, you guessed, MVIS. So, buy the stock unless someone with better LIDAR comes out, but not at retard prices."

2021-05-13 02:51:29,wallstreetbets,MM naked shorting and negative dark pool balance
2021-05-13 01:33:54,wallstreetbets,"Problem with that theory is Mobileye (Intel) have 13/15 top car manufacturers (and more small ones.like nio), and they already have a lidar chip supplier. And in 2025 they announced they will be making their own lidar chips in house.

So MVIS might be in demand for like augmented VR, but it's never going to break into the automotive scene."
2021-05-13 06:20:33,wallstreetbets,"Your hypothesis is that in lieu of having actual patented long range lidar designs, Intel's just going to somehow make it work because.... Reasons. I remain skeptical. Intel appears to be continuing to die a slow fractured death, so my money is not on them in the long term. Literally and figuratively."
2021-05-13 07:47:00,wallstreetbets,Why would it be required for lv 4 autonomy? All you need for self driving car is good AI and vision. TSLA has the best AI atm because it has the most data because they have the most cars on the road all getting data and while obviously it's not perfects atm it's continuously getting better and better. No need for MVIS
2021-05-13 08:21:56,wallstreetbets,"I am not an expert in the field and have only a cursory understanding, but the consensus I have collected over the last couple years of research is that AI vision is not capable of detecting objects reliably (yet) at the range required to support L4 autonomy. Bear in mind, when we talk about L4, we are not just awaiting the annoucement that ""Elon got it werken!"" - There is a government body (in the US) involved in deciding when/where these types of vehicles get to operate and you have to ask yourself what you think \*they\* will decide is required.  


tl;dr - I don't know anything more than the next guy and am just collecting information to guide my investments. I work in software engineering/machine learning (not AI) so my bias may be showing, but I believe we will achieve viable LIDAR L4 \*prior\* to AI vision being capable of it. I have not come across a AI vision system that does not use LIDAR and claims near L4 capability, please point it out if I have just missed it as this might change my current hypothesis."

2021-05-13 01:30:51,wallstreetbets,"Could be another day of ups and/or downs today, so here are some tips for you apes to stay on top of your game.

Stay hydrated - whisky is best here, but if before noon where you are, consider a healthier clear spirit like vodka or pure grain alcohol.

Eat a nutritious and balanced breakfast - make sure to include all five major crayon colours, and plenty of tendies for protein. Bananas are acceptable.

Perform one act of kindness - make your wife‚Äôs boyfriend a cup of coffee to start his day right - he‚Äôs probably very tired.

Do some mindfulness mantras - chanting a mantra over and over again can be very helpful in keeping the mind calm. A few suggestions include; ‚ÄòHoly Moly‚Äô, ‚ÄòI like the stock‚Äô, or ‚ÄòTo the moon‚Äô.

Take some time away from your computer screen - in this day and age, sitting for too long in front of your computer can be very taxing. Be good to yourself, and occasionally switch to staring at your phone screen instead.

Good luck out there today, retards."

Inflation is devaluing currency, right? Makes our dollars have less buying power for goods. But you know what‚Äôs *not* experiencing inflation? 

*Dave and Buster‚Äôs tickets*.

That‚Äôs right. We take out substantial personal loans. Take 50% and buy D&B play cards, hit up Ski Ball or that game where you put a token down the ramp and launch it into stuff for points (that shits how you get the *real* moolah) and take in that sweet sweet square chain of consumerism which we trade for Pelot√≥n treadmills or whatever it is they sell there these days. 

Now you may be asking ‚Äúwhat happened to the other 50% of the loan?‚Äù 

We buy $PLAY calls, that‚Äôs what. Boom. Making money going in *and* coming out. Paying ourselves for tickets. Everybody goes home with a stoned Rasta banana plushie, a belly full of appetizers, a vehicle full of soon to be re-sold electronics, and a portfolio full of green."

Wednesday 7:24 PM

70F Sunny, Clear skies

A portrait composed of inappropriate humor, airbrushed in stripes of pinkest pink, sprinkled with irrational exuberance, and adorned with the levity to laugh at yourself and circumstances, make for a diamond set of armor against the monotonously gray daily grind and daunting sense of futile responsibility of being an adult. Sometimes it is necessary to simply return home, take off the mask of falsehoods, of choreographed smiles and pleasantry, and just laugh at the cruel humor that the day, month, and years have dealt you, as if you were still a teen.

Perhaps it was u/angrysc0tsman12 who pushed me over the edge, or maybe it was simply u/sloptart69. Either way, we must stop clinging to the comfortable continuity of the daily grind. Just stop passively watching the grays of the day wash away, blending itself indistinguishably into the next, as days become months, then years."
2021-05-12 22:29:22,wallstreetbets,"I almost have a feeling that the market will start out pretty red again just because everyone else who doesn't normally pay attention will kinda be like ""oh shit the markets tanking? I better go hoard some gas and then drink all my extra gasoline that I have in this grocery bag just to really make sure no one else gets some.""


Meanwhile the rest of us are going to be like... ""No way this could get lower anybody with any sense would have either held or sold by now..."" 

So red to glean the final Klingons... then maybe around 10 or 11 things start to swing back?

I see a strong likelihood of the indices making a bounce today/tmrw/early next week before any further drops... there‚Äôs been a 4% drop on spx so far this week and a 7% drop on ndx since last week... we‚Äôll prolly gap down a bit, but I expect a nice bounce off these levels for now, so if you‚Äôre still holding onto your calls wait for a bounce and recoup some losses imo...I actually want the daytime crew to capitulate their calls at opening and hop into puts and get whacked again üòÇ

In West Philadelphia, born and raised - down the street from Cramer is where I spent most of days. Jimmy Chilln out, maxing, relaxing all cool - all buying some calls outside the school - when a couple of positions, up to no good, started making trouble on my Robinhood. I zeroed out my account and my mom got scared - said you're moving in with your Aunt and Uncle who are bears.

I bought my first put, and when theta came near I could smell sweat off his balls and he stuck his dick in my rear. If anything I could say it gave me a scare but I thought, nah forget it, it's part of being a bear!

I pulled  out of my puts down 70 or 80 and I yelled to theta yo holmes, why you came in me? Looked at my losses - I was finally there, to sit on my throne, the üåàest of bears."

Yes they could break that promise but it would lower the confidence people have in their word. Furthermore Jpow has already referred to this specific inflationary patch as ""Transitory"". Making it out like this is something that is the result of specific causes (like supply chain issues for example) and that it will pass. 

Granted, it's his job to say that and so I'm reserving 25% for the possibility that it's about to get legitimately bloody but for some reason i'm calm. I'd be absolutely shocked if they hike interest and set off the chain reaction. They'd have to WANT to fuck everything up. That's literally how the great depression started."

Why sell WKHS at $40 ($16 avg) when you can dump it at $9 and $7 after avging up and buying the dip constantly even tho it was fairly apparent the catalyst/USPS is a lost cost.

Oh well a -50% trade or 30 mil L on a 3 bil fund isn't a big deal but thus far this year it's pretty obvious their 5 year horizon talk is pure bullshit. (There's like tons more example of these dip buying adventure where they exit for an L completely like FSLY in ARKW)

- back when most of you were still in your dad‚Äôs balls, I bought 100 shares of TSLA for $28/ share. Sold everything when it hit $90, and got bear curious around $150 and bet the profits on TSLA puts. Needless to say that didn‚Äôt work out well.

- Puts on AMZN when it was at $280 LOL.

- Puts on GME when all you dumb fucks were playing chicken with hedge funds. Didn‚Äôt even manage to make anything on that and it seems obvious.

- SPY puts to occasionally hedge against heavy tech positions. Never seem to time the right.

2021-05-12 22:54:26,wallstreetbets,"Oil price was going up because the demand is increasing (summer/covid dissapating) and oil companies have lower stocks than expected (not enough supply for the demand). The pipeline being shutdown was bullish, as it means there will be even greater demand and higher prices = greater profits. Oil was in the middle of a run before the broader market sell off.

There will be more printing in the interim in the hope that deflation is headed off. They hope that inflation and a return to work will get the economy moving.

Wheat is an example of the former and lumber an example of the latter. I am buying commodity stocks and looking for other potential upcoming shortages."

Went 50% in still based on past 3 bounces from $75 (see image)... &Assuming AMD will keep trading in ranges and bounce with similar market conditions (i.e. rotations to values and 10 yrs yield below 1.75%) and continue to do mean reversion?

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Psychedelics are the Future of Psychiatry and Mental Health When I read everyone's opinion on companies using mushrooms for psychiatric disorders I know that most people don't have medical or neuroscience backgrounds. The current work in therapeutic psychedelics has increased over the last ten years. Last year there was a record number of academic research articles regarding psychedelics, over 5,000 papers. (That decrease in 2021 is the current number of papers that have been accepted and published. I expect the number in 2021 to hit around 7,000 papers)

In 2021, there has already been two big articles published in the New England Journal of Medicine and Nature Medicine (two of the biggest academic journals). The NEJM article was regarding psilocybin and lexapro and there was an overall decrease in depression score when comparing the two groups. The results were not significant statistically, but the sample size wasn't that big. Small sample sizes affects the statistics greatly especially if 1 or 2 people falls outside 2-3 standard deviations. The Nature Medicine article which was posted on the 10th of May involved treating severe PTSD with MDMA (ecstasy). In this experiment the results were significant! This means that the findings showed a statistically significant decrease in PTSD symptoms when conducting a MDMA counseling session.

I am a medical student in my psychiatry clerkship and I've discussed this with all of my attendings and the residents. This is the future of psychiatry and mental health. Mindmed is currently looking at other areas where psychedelics could beneficial. Depression, anxiety, PTSD, chronic pain, ADHD, substance abuse, etc. This is just the beginning of areas where psychedelics can be applied. Further chemical manipulation can produce more therapeutic drugs.

For those who are not pharmacologists or chemists all psychedelics have a serotonergic backbone. Meaning that they are all similar to serotonin. Serotonin is our feel good neurotransmitter and is the clinical target for depression. The current medication regimen for depression is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Their mechanism of action is to increase serotonin by blocking reuptake in our synapses. ALL PSYCHEDELICS ARE SEROTONIN ANALOGS! This is good! Depression and anxiety have not had any new breakthroughs since the 1980s, sertraline and fluoxetine (Prozac and Zoloft). With more and more people being diagnosed with depression and anxiety it is a 4.7 BILLION dollar market. Imagine getting into this breakthrough at $3.00 a share. The potential of this field of research and the current market is astronomical. This treatment will be the future of psychiatry and mental health. When including other areas like substance abuse and chronic pain you are looking at an even bigger market. These shares in a few years could be at $200 dollars a share.

I am not a financial expert or a stock broker. I am a medical student who is working in this field. I am not associated with any company and I have no conflicts of interest. I am just stating research that is being produced at an increasing rate."

2021-05-12 22:22:44,wallstreetbets,"It's super difficult to explain but I'll try: The therapy session aren't just short term solutions, they are long term. It affects the whole structure of ones brain and the neural pathways. When you are depressed your brain makes a depression trench of neural pathways. That pathway reinforces depression. When you take a therapeutic dose, which doesn't include the crash after taking the drug, it takes you out of that trench and allows your brain to make other ""happy"" pathways. With the psychedelic and therapy session your brain can register why you are depressed and help you get out of it. It's a whole thing. Plus some chemists are taking the visual hallucinations out of the drug, it might be a little too intense for some people."
2021-05-13 01:45:25,wallstreetbets,"I agree with everything you said and had similar thoughts before. This makes me, as someone with depression and GAD, still bearish on shrooms and LSD.

These treatments are going to require a controlled safe space where someone like a therapist can be with you and help guide you and make sure the medications don't make your situation worse. This is completely different than how current medications for these issues are given. A regular doctor can and will prescribe anti-depressents and anti-anxiety medications, and send you on your way home. I personally hate how this system works, as it leaves the patient to struggle alone, these medications takes weeks, and often require switching multiple times to find what's right for the patient.

So I don't think the play is investing in manufacturers. Because the demand won't be there due to how involved the process needs to be. I wonder if it could be structured like a rehab resort, 2-3 weeks there and you are dosed, guided safely, and monitored. Only after completing the course without any issue are patients prescribed the drugs to take home if even needed."
2021-05-13 06:36:46,wallstreetbets,"I am under the impression that the statement ‚Äúserotonin is our feel good neurotransmitter‚Äù is at best a big oversimplification. 

If it were a 1-to-1 exchange between more serotonin and feeling better, SSRIs would work extremely well, but for all I know, they are not that powerful.

With that in mind, could you explain why scientists believe serotonin is related to ‚Äòfeeling good‚Äô and if so, in what sense should I understand ‚Äòfeeling good‚Äô?"

2021-05-12 23:38:50,wallstreetbets,"To clarify, I never suggested psilocybin has no impact on serotonin.  I am suggesting neuroscientists who study effective depression reduction are focusing on glutamate due to the explosive action of brain activity when glutamate is targeted.  Glutamate may allow more pathways where depression is imprinted to be reset...plasticity effect."
2021-05-13 09:59:06,wallstreetbets,"Do you mean qualitatively or quantitavely via the literature?

My own qualitative experience is that they are, indeed, utterly shit.

Regarding research its an entirely different story since for a new medication to be shown to be better, and recommended as a new first line treatment, it needs a huge amount of evidence that demonstrates it to be so.

There needs to be enough high quality data, several meta studies (studies comparing the effects of other studies) showing a consistently reproducible, significant difference, before things such as NICE guidelines get updated.

That is, necessarily going to take a very long time."

2021-05-12 23:39:29,wallstreetbets,I stand corrected
2021-05-13 09:38:32,wallstreetbets,"The ""tripping"" will never be taken out of it for clinical purposes if we are discussing treatment and therapy.  It plays a crucial role in assessing issues without the imprint of biographical experience.

To the post regarding affect, you are failing to understand the mechanism of improvement in assessment data in patients utilizing these therapies.

Neuroplasticity allows your brain to change and heal.  We now know that depression, stress, and anxiety can literally damage your brain.  It is visible.  Psychadelic research is exciting because we are learning the brain can regrow connections and heal and there are mechanisms to enhance this healing process.  This has significant implications on degenerative neural diseases and the concept of anti-aging as applied to the brain.  Think NAD.  BDNF.  Brain derrived neutrophic factor.

Your personal experiencs is much more akin to returning to a ""normal"" state of mind.  However these states change over time.  No one is going to use ketamine daily...it is not necessary.  Microdosing may be a future possibility but it removes the therapy guided approaches for PTSD patients.  One major goal is processing trauma without the retraumatizing oneself when discussing/remembering the trauma, thereby allowing the memory to have less impact on the emotional state of the patient.  Disassociation is crucial to this goal."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC Ultimate DD - still hot This DD is NOT my own, but was removed for troublesome language. I read through the DD and understand why the OP had their post pulled down. That being said, the content is solid and I think its worth repeating. I have edited the below DD to remove the parts that were maybe a little too over-eager.

$UWMC ULTIMATE DD

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC. The massive 5.75% dividend. Their insanely LOW P/E of about 3.9 and their insane income growth. 4,200% increase in net income! üöÄ (No that‚Äôs not a typo)

So why would any one want to buy this stock right now ?

The CEO is a beast. And not only did they reaffirm their dividend (ex date in June) and just make $860M in the first quarter, they announced the approval of a $300M stock buy back. That‚Äôs big money ! But let‚Äôs dive deeper. The $300M share buy back is of the class A shares that are in the float. $UWMC has a very small float.

104M shares. $300M / $6.70 = 45M. That means at current prices they can buy back nearly 44% of the entire F\*\*kin float. You have never heard of that before and you probably never will again. On earnings call yesterday CEO says ‚ÄúWe can start buying shares tomorrow and I am a buyer at this price !‚Äù

So that leaves 60M shares left in the float. Institutions own 23M of them (I bet it‚Äôs higher) short interest is close to 13M based on latest data.

This just caused the borrow rate to increase by 5X ! new data shows short borrow rates just hit 25%

Apes, there are less than 35M shares freely traded in this stock right now.

On top of all this we still have Russell Inclusion to be announced in June and another blow out 2Q is in the works.

This is NOT financial advice but I can't think of a reason I shouldn‚Äôt park a few dollars in a highly profitable stock, trading at all time lows, paying a 6% dividend with a current p/e under 4?

My position 7900 shares @ 7.64 and 45x 6/18 8c

TL,DR üèò=üíµüíµüíµüíµ = UWMC üöÄüöÄüöÄü§ë  


Edit: since I posted there are only 2,000 shares to loan and the borrow rate is 35%!!?!??

The refinance market is withering away and RKT will need to replace some of their Direct-to-Consumer volume somewhere.

Now that they're both public companies, investors might push back on pricing wars. I think there's a delicate balance of capturing market share vs. generating profit moving forward.

Tbh, I think the first casualty of pricing competition is going to be HMPT (which I think is being reflected in their stock price)."

If it drops to $6 and i sell i lost $1(from $7) but my cost basis was $9 so i then have a $3 loss that i ‚Äúcan‚Äùapply elsewhere?  So basically im unaffected?"

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Don't be fooled, the CPI numbers being spread can all be explained by the Lumber and Semiconductor Shortage A lot of you have looked at the numbers, but how many of you have actually looked INTO the numbers? I'm going to break down the numbers, and tell you why you're worrying your heads off over nothing. Precursor: Shit hasn't changed, inflation is no more than it was last month.

#The month on month data:

There's a lot of information to take in, so I'll do my best to explain it in the comments, to anyone confused by what I'm saying. A lot of the explanations are very simple but here goes:

- All items less food and energy account for 79.125 weighting on the whole CPI. Digging into the data, the more heavily weighted portions is commodities less food and energy commodities (which carrys 20 weight). Furniture and bedding increased 2.1% (0.94 Weight). Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. 

- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.

- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).

As you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.

The next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).

- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) 

As you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. 

#The Year on Year CPI data:

If you really think this is evidence of inflation, you're retarded. You're measuring from the bottom of the market, just after the pandemic became real, to where we stand now. 

Anyways, throw any questions my way, or you can find the CPI data if you think I've made all these numbers up. 

TLDR: No inflation (Well there is inflation, obviously, but you get what I mean), lumber and semiconductor shortage help to explain everything."
2021-05-12 23:57:45,wallstreetbets,"Although I agree with you, it's summer and there's a bunch of inflation fear mongering. We also have to deal with slower reopening due to vaccination.

What wall street is not realizing is people are not wanting to work shit jobs for shit wages. They're going to cut back to 1 job households, spending less as they go. Maybe they will take jobs in the fall when school starts back up, but only if businesses offer better pay. They won't come to this realization for a few months though, as red states cut unemployment and find people still don't want to work.

Better to cash out where you can, and buy the fat dip coming in a few months. Maybe even pick up some inverse spy and qqq."
2021-05-12 23:21:14,wallstreetbets,"The inflation you speak of is far more pervasive than just lumber and semis. Margins and spot prices on a variety of chemicals, steel, building components that do not include steel and lumber, and commodities are all parabolic. Wages have been hot fire the past four quarters too, believe it or not. I don't understand why people look past food inflation because that one is staring you in the face.

We don't really need to speculate whether or not inflation is coming. It's already here, and we have definitive proof. Some of it is temporary due to supply chain issues that can get resolved within a year, but there is plenty of ""sticky"" inflation too, wages being top on that list. 

And FYI - the CPI gauge is such a heavily manipulated stat with all the hedonic adjustments for quality and other factors. You're going to have a bad time if that's your primary gauge. I trust management teams of companies reporting during earnings season for their view on inflationary pressures a hell of a lot more than CPI."

2021-05-12 23:49:42,wallstreetbets,"My friends friend works at a company that makes lumber and steel things that go into houses, some sort of contraption for framing I think, anyway. He says their 12 month demand forecast is somewhat up, but nothing they can't handle. According to him the problem right now is just a pull-forward in demand caused by fear, resulting in immediate supply constraints and price hikes which should work themselves out once everyone figures out how to calm down. It's just one anecdote though"

2021-05-12 23:52:56,wallstreetbets,My one point of disagreement is about the jobs report. There's plenty of demand for workers and the reasons for people not taking the work are mostly based on historic anomalies associated with the pandemic
2021-05-12 23:27:01,wallstreetbets,"Re-shoring could be a major theme over the next decade for certain industries. The Chinese cold war we are in has not abated, in fact it's continuing to degrade, so it would not surprise me to see more supply chain manufacturing be brought back either to the States or at least a friendlier nation. That process will probably yield higher push thru costs to consumers. Hopefully we have the wage growth to match."
2021-05-12 22:15:46,wallstreetbets,"If rampant forest fires burned 90% of forests and the cost of lumber skyrockets due to low supply, this is not inflation. However it would be reflected in an increase in CPI. You are oversimplifying inflation in a way the OP is trying to clarify. He is not being internally inconsistent at all."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why is $UWMC the Best Meme Stock Today? I wrote a DD on $UWMC pre-earnings. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9xrrg/is_the_market_right_about_uwmc/)). It was obviously too long for people who can't read.

All other meme's stocks are trash today and $UWMC is the only breakout winner. Today's market movements show what UWMC investors already knew: Mat Ishbia is pissed Wall Street doesn't like his company.

See, Mat Ishbia has been in the trenches building UWM from 15 employees to 8,000+ for about 20 years. He did it profitably without outside financing. He sold 7% of his company to take it public at $10/share and Wall Street has been crapping on it ever since.

Remember when you were a kid and took hours drawing that nice picture for your dad and he looked at it for .5 seconds and said, ""You're shit at drawing."" and then went back to drinking his coffee and reading the paper? Yeah, that drawing is $UWMC except the kid is Mat and he is a billionaire.

Here is what is special and unique about $UWMC. The 100m+ shares of the float represent a small fraction of shares. So Mat's personal wealth is affected greatly by little Kenny on Wall Street trying to make a few bucks shorting it. Ken has millions on the line, Mat has billions. And if you don't know this about Mat, dudes a bonafide winner.

He is taking on Rocket Mortgage and plans to be the largest originator in America in five years. He keeps saying he is growing and Wall Street isn't listening. Now... he has a $300 million share buyback war chest, 5%+ dividend, and a tiny float. He just needs a match but the board gave him a flamethrower.

In the conference call he said, ""At these prices, I'm a buyer."" and seemed genuinely giddy to buy tomorrow.

So this price action is just the start of the share buybacks. I'm in it til $16/share.

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Managed Investment Account for Short-Term, High-Risk, Aggressive Picks? Maybe not the right place to post, but r/investing hates this type of thing.  Any other subs for this type of thing?

Before I get the talk, I'm financially stable, retirement accounts maxed, emergency fund, etc., etc.  Assume this is entirely play money, I'll survive if I lose every penny, this is my version of gambling.

It probably doesn't exist, but I'm looking for someone to basically play the WSB game for me.  I've been on here for a while, I've been doing my own risky investing for a while.  My real job is just too busy, I miss the times to sell, forget about it, lose money not just because that's how it goes, but because of my own fault.

Is there some high risk account management out there?  Either human or automated?  In my perfect world, I would pay someone to make short-term investments for me.  The main limiting factor, is that I need to be able to access the funds if possible, hence why short-term investments probably make the most sense.  Otherwise, I would just pay some big company to invest for me, but even on their ""aggressive"" accounts, they typically want it for 3 years, and you can't really sell if you need to.

I'm dreaming of something that doesn't exist, aren't I?  Any other options?  What if you had some money to invest foolishly and hope to get rich quick without any time to do it?"

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How to make ""free"" money by lending out your AMC shares Right now, short sellers are willing to pay very high interest to short AMC stock.  You can track borrow costs at [iBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/amc).  If you lend your shares out to short sellers, you can get paid for holding AMC.  You can get paid like 10% annualized or more.

**Method A**:  If you use Interactive brokers, sign up for their ""yield enhancement program"".

**Method B**:  Lend your shares out through the options market.

Here's how you do method B.  Buy a call option and sell a put option at the same strike price.

For example, you can buy a June 16 $11 call for $1.70 and sell the $11 put for $2.38.  If AMC goes sideways (its current price is $10.41), you will lose $0.59 on the put option.  So, you are getting paid **$0.09** for holding AMC until June 16 (37 days).  No matter what the stock price does, you will be 9 cents ahead of just owning the stock directly.

If you don't hit the bid/ask spread and use limit orders to get your position, you can probably buy the call for slightly cheaper and sell the put for slightly cheaper.  So, that would let you make more than 9 cents per 100 shares... it's somewhere less than 18.5 cents.

The bid/ask for AMC and the options are:

AMC  $10.43 / $10.44  
$11 call  $1.67 / $1.70  
$11 put  $2.37 / $2.50

If you paid the midpoint price for everything, you'd make 18.5 cents.  Usually the market makers will cheat you so you lose money to transaction costs.

**Method C**:  Don't lend your shares out.  Just buy a deep in-the-money call option on AMC.  Deep in-the-money refers to strike prices lower than the current trading price.  If the strike price is really low, then the call option will be extremely similar to owning the stock.  For example, a $0 strike price would almost be the same as owning the stock (except for the borrowing costs reflected in the price of the options).  The problem with buying a really low strike price is that the spreads are wider --> your transaction costs are higher.

The $9 call has fairly low spreads because options under $3 get price in penny increments.

So let's say AMC is trading at 10.46/10.47 and the $9 call is trading at $2.46/$2.51.  If you buy the call and AMC goes sideways, then you lose $1.035 per 100 shares because the options premium on AMC is very expensive.  But if the stock goes to 0, then the options premium would be worth it because you lose $2.50 instead of $10.465.

==============

# Why some dirtbag investment professionals don't lend their shares out

Suppose that a lot of AMC shareholders moved all of their shares out of their margin account and into a cash account.  This would lower the supply of shares that can be lent out, potentially driving the borrowing costs to something ridiculous.  If the borrow costs are too high, short sellers will start covering their positions (e.g. buying the stock) because they don't want to lose money on their trade.  Sometimes they have no choice- if the broker cannot locate shares to borrow, the broker will force the client's account into covering the short position.  (The broker is legally obligated to do this because naked short selling is supposed to be illegal.)

What they try to do is market manipulation.  They buy lots of shares and put all of them into a cash account.  The rising stock price creates a short squeeze along with some potential forced covering from short sellers who cannot locate shares to borrow.  Market manipulation is illegal by the way.

But anyways, that's the only argument against lending out your shares.  So, you should probably take advantage of the free money."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Stock Registration for dummies Hello retards, 

I had a question nagging at me ever since Vlad the impaler and old Thomas Petterfy  stopped my flawless dip buy of my favorite stock @ 100 a share on Jan 28th. As I sat there enraged on the toilet slamming my phone screen with my thumbs I was struck with a thought....how do I know that my shares are mine? These shares are actually owned by my broker, and only in my shady ass broker's books does it say I am the owner. is there a way for me to own my shares without having to worry about a broker as a middleman? who does that? why do they do that? what are the pros and cons?

And so today, rather than do my work I finally decided to find out.  So I called fidelity and the customer service rep trotted to the back office to ask his smart accounting nerds because he didn't have a fucking clue either.  Turns out becoming a registered share holder is done through what's called a transfer agent, and these agents are selected by the issuing company.  The transfer agent and the registrar (the DTC) handle the registration of shares in the direct registration system (DRS) which is some sort of electronic book keeping system meant to keep track of who owns what shares. He was kind enough to give me the name and phone number of GME's transfer agent:

computershare 800-522-6645

I then had a web chat with a saucy looking customer rep named Donna A. who told me exactly how I can transfer my shares from my brokerage account to establish an account with computershare:

*The broker will need to submit a request for a DTC* [*W/T*](https://z1.le.liveperson.net/a/54722259/#W/T) *Transmission. Computershare cannot initiate this transfer. If the broker is unfamiliar with the DTC Transmission process, they should contact their back office for assistance or contact their representative at DTC.*

*The broker will initiate the request through their back office using the following shareholder information:*

*1 The complete name of the Transfer Agent: Computershare Investor Services.*  
*2 Tax ID Number (TIN).*  
*3 The exact registration (complete name and address) on the Computershare account. (If the shareholder does not have an existing Computershare account, provide the exact registration as it appears on the brokerage account.)*  
*4 Exact number of shares to be transferred (whole shares only).*  
*5 The full CUSIP number of the stock holding company.*  
*Note: If the registration, address, and SSN match the shares will go into the existing account, if anything is off it will open a new account.*

by ""existing account"" she's referring to an existing account with computershare, which I opened this morning by buying a single share through the directstock purchase program.  this is the second way in  which you can acquire shares in your name, buy them through your account with computershare.  now this process seems less desirable to me. Since buying a share was the only way I could figure out how to open an account through their website (which their phone system directed me to do), I entered my personal info, tax information and a checking account and routing number and then selected how much money I wanted to invest.  I picked $150 for about one share.  I was notified that my purchase will be bought on the market 5 days from now (at whatever price it is), and settled in my account 2 days after (well jesus that's slow).  Donna says they will buy whatever amount of shares they can get for the dollar amount I selected (including partial shares).

It should be noted here, that to sell the shares through the transfer agent computershare is also an arduously slow process.  you can submit a sell order that gets issued to the market on a predetermined schedule (say 5 days from the day you initiate it). I can also transfer them out to one of my brokerage accounts to sell them.  Fidelity warned me that this could take days to transfer, because it requires the request and coordination of individuals in the two back offices to effectuate (similar to when I transferred my shares from one brokerage to another it took 48 hours or so).   I warned them that I might be retarded enough to casually ignore such a warning and if I ever needed to sell which was highly unlikely, well then those buyers won't mind waiting a couple of days for my shares to clear.

so you may be asking why would someone do this, why would they abandon their broker and restrict their ability to quickly buy and sell their shares. There's a few decent articles if you search Direct registration system (thebalance dot com) in google but essentially it was created for:

* investors who want counter party risk against your stockbroker going bankrupt, your claim is with the issuing company, not the brokerage so you don't have to deal with SIPC or the hassle of getting your account back afterwards
* removing the middleman from delivering annual reports, 10k filings, proxy statements, voting info etc. since your name and address are recorded directly these materials are mailed or emailed to you promptly as the shareholder of records
* inability for brokers to lend your shares.  for dividend stocks if your shares are lent for shorting the dividend can become an unqualified ""payment in lieu of dividends"" increasing your tax burden. The brokers don't have your shares, can't use them for collateral can't do shit with them because they are yours
* I have not investigated yet, but computershare has countries outside the US (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, United Kingdom) listed, implying that if I ever move to one of those countries I could buy shares in my name and get access to direct voting and dividends and all the other joys of being a real shareholder. 

TLDR: I was curious how to own my shares directly, not through some shell corporation owned by a bulgarian vampire, so I found out and decided to share with the few of you retards who can actually read."

* Gaymestronk could get cut in half or double in price in 10 minutes at any given moment
* tech stocks are bleeding like a knife wound but can have random 10% days (not to mention the hundreds of stocks with no P/E *at all* doing wild swings)
* lockdowns still doing weird shit
* gas shortage panics while michigan is trying to cut off the Canadian-US pipeline
* middle east conflicts starting up fast
* month-to-month inflation is 4.2%, fed is still keeping interest rates low as balls on a hedgehog
* memecoin values are based on hopes that a dude talks about them on a sketch show
* notable hedge funds are liquidating
* building materials are tripling in cost over the month
* and we have an actual unmet labor demand while new stimmies are being sent out

And while all this is happening, SPY is up 39%, DIA is up 39%, Nasdaq is up over 42% over the last 12 months. I don't think many people would disagree with the fact that the market is generally overvalued right now. But, if you buy puts, you can expect those to bleed out and let some market maker run off with your money while you sit there hoping for a drop (ew). But of course you know its all built on a house of cards, so a call will either bleed or get wiped on an overnight swing. Companies can beat earnings estimates by 50% and drop the next day because it's ""priced in"" and mid-market companies with a huge run up will start issuing shares the second they get the chance.

I think inflation fears are helping drive the price down, but they'll clear up and prices will shoot back up like they never happened because people are greedy fucks.

Most of the unment labour isn't essential (even if they were told they were during the pandemic), and won't be a big deal I think. Most business will do fine raising their wages, they've been pushing down too hard for ages.

2021-05-12 21:25:41,wallstreetbets,Been all in on GME since Feb and I sleep like a baby.
2021-05-12 21:26:39,wallstreetbets,I am [watching VIX and it's cousins](https://youtu.be/s4uEP1WdjSc) to see when the market is going to hit the bottom and jump back in.
2021-05-12 21:27:00,wallstreetbets,Around March I predicted the possibility of the market collapsing in June if JPow raised interest rates and caused the ‚Äòbubble of everything‚Äô to burst. I saw the posts from Dr Burry warning us the bubble of everything will burst soon early this year and ruminated on it thinking he is probably right. Only problem is timing when will it happen. I was planning on cashing out at the end of the May then reinvesting once the bottom looks like it‚Äôs been established. Seems like I was a month off and interest rates rising weren‚Äôt the indicator.
2021-05-12 21:28:39,wallstreetbets,"Honestly the short term swings haven‚Äôt been working for me so I‚Äôve been just focusing on my longer term holds in my other portfolio. I mean as long as you‚Äôre in decent companies that won‚Äôt fall apart in say the next year you‚Äôll be fine if you can stomach the ride. As far as knowing what to be or not be bullish on I can‚Äôt tell, Biden‚Äôs outlook as far as the economy goes isn‚Äôt really all that pretty it seems like we‚Äôre gonna print more money or hike up taxes either way isn‚Äôt great. And for war I can‚Äôt say I want it but Long calls on RTX almost never fail"
2021-05-12 21:31:30,wallstreetbets,Sadly we may be well into a stock market crash  maybe leading into WW3 if things in the Middle East does get worse. US pulling out of there is perfect for Russia it‚Äôs exactly what Putin wants
2021-05-12 21:33:35,wallstreetbets,"I'm new and  mostly in on mining memestocks. At least if they mess its because I chose one wrong horse rather than all the horses being shit. Very annoying to see all the graphs shoot up and stop the minute I decided to start investing

Still stressful though. At least when you lose in blackjack it's fairly instant. This is like those long drawn out sessions I used to have chasing losses only draw out over yr entire life potentially 

It does just make we want to to take it out it and put it in a Vanguard fund and forget about it, but I was never one for sensible."

2021-05-12 21:41:18,wallstreetbets,Inflation is narrowly focused to what‚Äôs open and available to buy. Country is opening up so inflation should tame
2021-05-12 21:41:22,wallstreetbets,A crash happens when no one is expecting it. Nothing goes up in a straight line forever. Long term I think the market is fine. The country will still thrive. But short term I feel it only getting worse. There‚Äôs nothing to curb the inflation fears and the supply chains around the world are going to be messed up for atleast the rest of the year. We are not even in peak season for businesses yet.
2021-05-12 21:41:35,wallstreetbets,There's a strong possibility that MVMDF (U.S.) MVMD (Canada) is about to gap up significantly.  I suggest you look into it. imho

2021-05-12 22:01:18,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not nervous about making moves. I just don‚Äôt believe doing anything extreme immediately helps. The more the market drops, the higher my expected rr when I begin buying. The main thing is that I‚Äôve learned to take off my hedges faster so I already did in part. Plus I bought some fx (non-USD) cause I think the idea, which the market seems to believe, that the US will have to raise rates faster than the rest of the world is dumb. Other countries stimmed too and the stuff that‚Äôs driving inflation like chips and metal isn‚Äôt a US thing only. 

So I wait for another 2-3% and then start SLOWLY buying. 20% down and all-in. Higher than that and I‚Äôd start borrowing to buy."

2021-05-12 23:11:49,wallstreetbets,Wanna make free money follow GME wait for a big spike up. When the rsi starts to go down and the green bars turn to red buy ITM QQQ and SPY puts. Sell them when GME starts to go back up or buy ITM calls on QQQ SPY and do the reverse. You can follow the charts and look at the times the peaks are in sync. GME moves faster so there is like 30 seconds to a minute of lag between the index. For highest profits wait till around 11 am and stop around 3 pm. I'm not sure how long till they change the algos but this seems to be very effective so far for the past couple days.

Since 4pm last night vix has barely moved seems like it would have need to go down a significant amount before open.

2021-05-12 23:47:48,wallstreetbets,This guy gets it. The inflation we are seeing now is stressed supply chains. Demand isn‚Äôt magically roaring back.

Idk I don‚Äôt pay tax in US but that could explain the dips before everyone buys back in.
2021-05-12 22:17:27,wallstreetbets,Google it.  The taiwan defense treaty ended in 1980.  The one that took its place (Taiwan Relations Act) offers support but does not promise direct Military aid in case of an invasion.

2021-05-13 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Colonial Pipeline Buying Opportunity?? With Colonial pipeline being shut down this week by a successful cyberattack, we are starting to feel the effects of a fragile supply chain reminiscent of the 2020 toilet paper apocalypse. Initially, I didn't think much of it, but now 4 days into it, 90% of the gas stations in our area have run out of fuel. What is stopping something like this from happening to the power grid? Water treatment plants? Nuclear plants? Nothing. Coincidentally on April 20th, the feds (to keep this apolitical) released a 100-day plan on increasing cybersecurity measures to increase protection of, what I now realize, is a fragile and broken system. This was already on their radar and of concern long before the first successful US attack not even 3 weeks after unveiling the plan.  


To the point: With the prepper community starting not to look so crazy after all (swap out the EMP fears for cyber attacks), ***will this create deeper demand for solar energy, generators, and associated industries*** for protection against the now, more realistic, ""what if"" scenarios"" for businesses and individuals? What stocks do you think are poised for growth in these areas?"

Ericsson to pay $97 Million to Nokia for after settling damages claim

Telecoms gear maker Ericsson [(ERICb.ST)](https://www.reuters.com/companies/ERICb.ST) has reached an agreement with Finland's Nokia to pay a damages claim of 80 million euros ($97 million), it said on Wednesday.

Ericsson said the settlement followed investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) into corruption, including the bribing of government officials. It settled with the DoJ in 2019 and agreed to pay over $1 billion in penalties.

The DoJ had [said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ericsson-idUSKBN1YA2HU) that Ericsson admitted to conspiring with others to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from at least 2000 to 2016 by engaging in a scheme to pay bribes and to falsify books and records and by failing to implement reasonable internal accounting controls.

Ericsson said on Wednesday the settlement would impact operating profit (EBIT) by 80 million euros and cashflow by 26 million euros in the second quarter.

""The amount reflects uncertainty, risk, expense, and potential distraction from business focus associated with a potentially lengthy and complex litigation,"" it said in a statement.

The Swedish company added that the remainder of the settlement amount would be made in similar instalments in 2022 and 2023, impacting cash flow.

""Nokia can confirm that the information in Ericsson's press release is accurate. We have no further comment,"" a spokeswoman said.

Ericsson did not immediately respond to requests for further comment."

2021-05-13 10:44:43,wallstreetbets,"In my humble opinion what's happening with tilray being over sold with news that people don't quite understand. I been following aphria since last year because I owned some shares. The reason why I bought aphria last year was because I looked at it's balance sheet like i do with any other company ( I almost finished my accounting degree a few years back). I found that it had a very healthy and strong balance sheet. You always have to look at the company balance sheet so you can see how it's doing in the present and how it was doing a few years back. The reason why is because you need to compare how the ceo and management are managing the company. From what I saw from the balance sheet was that the ceo Irwin simon and his managers were doing a fantastic job because they had alot of cash in the bank from sales and operations compare to other cannabis companies including tilray. Aphria had alot of cash to simply buy Sweetwater from the u.s on November 2020 to have a foot in the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana. Tilray on the other hand is trying to get into other countries for it's medical marijuana and got a great deal when they gave tilray the permission to distribute it's medical marijuana in the united Kingdom on February 2021. Tilray has more countries to distribute it's medical marijuana and it also bought Manitoba Harvest to also have a foot into the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana, it's easy to look up this information. But germany and Canada are the biggest market for both aphria and tilray. The reason why am naming this two countries is because ladies and gentleman this two countries have been in lockdowns and so have other European nations in these past months. What the hell does that matter some may say, well if these countries went into lockdowns how can aphria and tilray make money. That's the reason why thier sales went down by alot this past quarter because they had no control over these lockdowns. You can check how much money aphria and tilray made in sales in 2020 and compare. Once these lockdowns have been lifted they will again start to make what they have been making. Aphria and tilray weren't named the biggest company based on sales for no reason. They will clearly be one of the leaders in the cannabis industry. I really can't understand how Canopy is valued at $40 while the new tilray is trading below $15 , which to me is dirt cheap. Tilray just reported out it's first quarter but people have to understand that they just reported the old tilray sales and not the new tilray ( aphria and tilray). As these lockdowns have been lifted and Europe is starting to open and the ceo Irwin simons and his managers start to manage the new tilray I see the company price jumping up close to where these past analyst are putting thier fair value price targets easily. I am in no means a financial advisor or an expert. Am just an informed trader and all the information I just gave can be easily looked up online. People have to get informed before making trades so please trade at your own risk and always verify any information you look up online."

It‚Äôs been falling steadily for a bit now though, and I don‚Äôt expect it to ever get back up to where it was. I also don‚Äôt expect a quick drop, but a slow bleed and likely a few unpredictable days where it climbs back up 5-10%. So far OTM puts don‚Äôt seem like the play to me and close to the money puts are expensive and not certain to pay out right now. I‚Äôm not saying I know what the stock is going to do, but what I *think* it‚Äôs going to do is slowly bleed out for the next month. That‚Äôs what I expected this last month and that‚Äôs what it did. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôll be under 100 by the end of June. That‚Äôs my opinion on it. And yeah, it is easy to call plays without skin in the game. So what?

Target, costco, amazon, etc, the same hardware is for sale everywhere. I get 5% off at Target using their CC and 3% off at Costco using a CIT visa. 

I don't think GME is going bankrupt. They will probably trim the 5500 stores down to 2500 and shrink their way back in to profitability. But it's a $40 stock on the high end based on fundamentals. Maybe $75 if you factor in A LOT of online sales growth which is plausible but I see as unlikely.

Retail is propping up the price because they believe it's going to go higher but sooner or later reality sets in and it will fall back to its fundamentals."

2021-05-13 13:07:42,wallstreetbets,"In response to the question you posted and deleted asking if I was too poor to afford a short position or too much of a pussy:

I just think it‚Äôs unwise. The ticker is more predictable than it was in February but it still throws curveballs, and today‚Äôs price action reinforces my opinion on it. I tried puts on GME before and learned my lesson the hard way. Still think it‚Äôs going to continue slowly bleeding out regardless though. The changes the company has made since the stock was trading at $4 don‚Äôt seem anywhere near enough to warrant it sitting around $150 to me. I think $4 was undervalued, but it‚Äôs way overvalued now. That‚Äôs my opinion. What do you expect it to do, and why?"
2021-05-12 20:10:42,wallstreetbets,I'm in AMC because GME got too expensive for me. Once AMC takes then I am jumping to GME with my gains.
2021-05-13 13:21:38,wallstreetbets,"Well fundamentally they cleared their debt and have almost 1 billion in cash.  They have an extremely successful leadership team which is one of the biggest factors in any transition.  Fundamentally if you evaluate them as a brick and mortar company you undervalued them because of their transition to e-commerce (not differently than how tesla was misss-valued as a car company when it is more like a technology/energy company or netflix that transitioned extremely successfully in digital media.

If GME can grow and capture even a fraction of the enormous market, it's evaluation could put it easily above $500/share fundamentally which makes  it extremely cheap right now for a long position.

And the short squeeze. It's going to pop because the entirety of the float is owned and people aren't selling.

I like the stock (not financial advice)"
2021-05-13 13:55:38,wallstreetbets,"Lol. As for your last point, it‚Äôs just ridiculous. This is a board where people discuss the market. Not everyone who talks about a ticker needs to have plays on it. I tried short positions on GME and got eaten alive by theta and I‚Äôm sure it would happen again. As I said in another comment yesterday I expect GME to slowly bleed out with occasional, unpredictable days where it jumps up 5-10% before giving that back. That doesn‚Äôt exactly make it prime shorting material. 

Also, you‚Äôre not interested in COIN? Are you bearish on it? Do you have short positions on every single ticker you‚Äôre bearish on? It‚Äôs just a stupid thing to say that I‚Äôm a pussy because I‚Äôm not shorting this stock. Even now that GME isn‚Äôt the main topic being discussed on WSB, it still gets discussed quite a bit and there are a ton of posts about it. So I have an opinion on it and I‚Äôm not shorting it for reasons I‚Äôve already explain to you. So what? It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm afraid of it, I just think it‚Äôs a dumb bet based on my prior experience and my assumptions for what it will do going forward. 

Now to your previous points. 500/share. That‚Äôs quite a valuation. You‚Äôre saying you expect *Gamestop* to end up with a market cap roughly 35b, putting it nearly in the top 500 companies by market cap. Up there with giants like Discover and Southwest Airlines. I just don‚Äôt see it happening man. They make most of their money from selling used video games right now, and if they do manage to break in to other markets the competition will be incredibly rough and I don‚Äôt see what edge they have. 

As for a short squeeze...sigh. Ya‚Äôll are really never gonna drop that shit. I‚Äôve had too many arguments with people explaining why it‚Äôs obvious that the shorts have already covered their positions and opened new ones and closed those and so on tons of times over by now to go through it all again. There‚Äôs always some ridiculous idea about why it‚Äôs definitely still gonna squeeze, usually not based on reality. 

So, I‚Äôm sorry that you think me discussing my opinion on a ticker (on a subreddit dedicated to discussing the market) without having a current open position on that ticker makes me a pussy. That‚Äôs depressing to hear because it sounds like you must really limit yourself on what you discuss. I talk about tons of tickers I don‚Äôt have current open positions on. I just like discussing this stuff. But if that‚Äôs how you feel, you do you man. For all ya‚Äôlls sakes I hope GME does squeeze, it would be great for retail to make some money. I just don‚Äôt see it happening, personally."

I‚Äôm just a regular guy who comments here (about a wide variety of shit, look through my comments and I‚Äôm here literally every day talking about all sorts of stuff) and doesn‚Äôt have insane unrealistic hopes for GME like you do.

If someone asks me if I think GME is a good investment I‚Äôll tell them what I think. My original comment here was responding to someone asking if it could hit 5k in a squeeze. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to squeeze and that was my response. I‚Äôm sorry you take this gamestop shit so personal that you‚Äôre forming conspiracy theories and calling people that don‚Äôt share your outlook pussies, but I don‚Äôt know what else to tell you.

2021-05-13 03:34:13,wallstreetbets,"It wasn't ""randomly picking a time"". It was the high, and it was 13 years ago. My point was that you mentioned gas going up as evidence supporting your post that ""Inflation is REAL"". The dollar is worth less than it was in 2008 when gas was $4 a gallon, so it's kinda hard to assume that inflation is the cause of gas hitting $3 now, especially when it jumped up due to a pipeline getting hacked. I already said this though, but you were too busy cherry picking to actually respond. 

I agree with your overall sentiment, but the current gas price has so many extraneous factors involved that it is incredibly hard (at this point, it is impossible) to prove that the gas price increase was caused by inflation. You made an incorrect statement about a pipeline that you clearly weren't very well versed in, and I'm guilty of that sometimes myself, but this response where you act like my point was illogical in one aspect, while completely ignoring the rest of it, is silly and it's not constructive at all."
2021-05-13 03:23:52,wallstreetbets,"Gas prices in Texas hit $4 a gallon in July 2008, and if you Google it, you will see that Bush Jr. was in office. That was the high. When Obama and Biden left office in early 2017, gas prices were $2.08 a gallon. With your logic, Obama and Biden actually caused an almost 50% drop in gas prices. Who knew Democrats support cheap fossil fuels? The trend is the same throughout the US, even if the numbers are slightly different. During the same time frame, the stock market went on one of the largest bull runs in history, but all of this has literally NOTHING to do with the point that I was making, and the president in office actually doesn't have that much of an effect on the price of gas. 


I didn't make any political statements originally because it isn't relevant at all, but it's always great to see people show that they are unable to question their own biases and just spew out whatever sounds good, with no regard to facts. If you think any of those past/current presidents are on your team, you are mistaken. They all have the same goal, and helping us out is not it. 


Moral of the story: a pipeline that isn't built yet (Keystone XL) has no affect on gas prices. When a pipeline that feeds the whole NE US gets shut down due to ransomware, that might raise gas prices. Go figure."

2021-05-13 15:41:19,wallstreetbets,"The conventional wisdom is that lazy, shiftless workers are sitting around on unemployment instead of working, because unemployment benefits are just so generous that nobody wants to work.

The reality is that these jobs often pay $2.35 per hour plus tips, and tip money isn't there because people are still mostly avoiding dining in restaurants. So, instead of making $2.35 per hour, people go to work for Amazon instead, who is hiring like crazy and pays a minimum of $15 per hour. Then restaurants hang up signs saying ""we're closed"" rather than pay enough of a wage to attract workers to what is still a hazardous environment.

Dishonest, partisan political narratives are precisely that."

2021-05-12 21:06:47,wallstreetbets,"All these autists are doing a shit job of telling you why bonds are bad in an inflationary market. The answer is bonds are not variable rate. So if you buy a bond now, at a low interest rate, you are stuck with it at that rate. It‚Äôs better to buy bonds once the interest rates have already increased. Problem with that is you never know when interest rates will stop increasing. Its like trying to time the high or low in a stock (but in reverse) - always a bad idea."

 Automation doesn't mean loss of jobs necessarily. So far in history it has not been proven that. In fact it wasn't long until we saw 3.3%, which was the lowest it was in years.

I think there will always some how be a way for jobs, because if not, then society will not have to worry about inflation, because most things would just be forced to be handed out by government. It will be more of a socialisms thing. Complete different then the world we live today.

There will be always jobs though. Many AI experts know at least in the few years that AI cannot replace all jobs, even white collar ones. They still aren't perfect replacement."

The goal of selling a call is: to expire that contract worthless, u want to make sure that contract u just sold has NO value left by its expiration date. This was you get to keep all the premium u got when u sold that call. When I am selling a call, I make sure it‚Äôs out-of-the-money call and it is expiring 45-90 days. So, the ONLY value the call has is extrinsic (time value) and nothing else. That option will lose some of its value everyday. That‚Äôs is what I want. I want it to be worthless by expiry.

2021-05-13 04:30:59,wallstreetbets,"I don't think a 300 year trend line is necessarily relevant when the manner in which the commodity is mined, stored, bought and used is so radically different today than it was 300 years ago. For starters, for much of that chart the silver price in USD was set by an act of congress at $1.29. Then there's a big dip when silver was first demonetized and then nationalized at 0.50c per ounce in the 30s. For the period of (relatiely) free-floating silver, it has acted as a hedge against highly inflationary currencies. Check out the gold/silver/forex chart on this page and you'll see what I mean - [https://sdbullion.com/gold-price](https://sdbullion.com/gold-price). The crazy 80s inflations around the world produced a big spike, as is today. Finally, you're ignoring the fact that people here are trying to time the market, not buy and hold for 300 years. 

Also, 500 down to 16 over 300 years? Is that supposed to be a big drop in wealth? Compare it to the purchasing power of cash and you'll see what inflation can do to you if you're not protected."
2021-05-12 23:29:20,wallstreetbets,"what is the actual non ""paper"" price of silver then? Like what do the electronics or manufacturing industry pay for the silver they need? Is the price/ounce similar to that of SLV? and for that matter, doesn't SLV track PSLV pretty well? (I truly don't know. But i'm asking cuz I've been sitting on a couple hundred shares of PSLV since GME's 1st mooning and that PSLV went nowhere...)"
2021-05-12 20:47:38,wallstreetbets,"Information and misinformation yes but supposedly the free market of ideas will sort that out given the time (kind of like we‚Äôre doing now).

Now exactly how much I don‚Äôt know but to your point silver is not present everywhere obviously. This goes a little beyond my ape brain but from my understanding it is more likely to be found in higher concentrations in close proximity to certain metals (the closest affinity being gold) so while some supply may increase due to increased mining for other metals (like lithium and cobalt) I don‚Äôt believe this to be a substantial part of annual production and certainly not enough to offset a run on silver where it is estimated that for every ounce of physical there are anywhere from 10-50x pieces of paper that refer to the same ounce (leasings, derivative market/futures, etc.)

Just like with GME, once enough people know the game is over and it‚Äôs parabolic.

Silver is just important enough to banks and our economic underpinnings that the manipulation patches most holes we put in their dam. One day soon though those leaks will tear the dam wide open...

&#x200B;

1) Basically couldn't log in for 30 minutes today after Elon went to Twitter.

2) Fees are high

3) Their app is NOT user friendly. I want to see how much I'm up or down. Sorry can't do that in Pro. You get a cute little graph in the regular Coinbase app.

4) Why the fuck are there two different apps? One is more user friendly with higher fees. The other is harder to use but lower fees? Ok."

2021-05-13 10:44:17,wallstreetbets,"In my humble opinion what's happening with tilray being over sold with news that people don't quite understand. I been following aphria since last year because I owned some shares. The reason why I bought aphria last year was because I looked at it's balance sheet like i do with any other company ( I almost finished my accounting degree a few years back). I found that it had a very healthy and strong balance sheet. You always have to look at the company balance sheet so you can see how it's doing in the present and how it was doing a few years back. The reason why is because you need to compare how the ceo and management are managing the company. From what I saw from the balance sheet was that the ceo Irwin simon and his managers were doing a fantastic job because they had alot of cash in the bank from sales and operations compare to other cannabis companies including tilray. Aphria had alot of cash to simply buy Sweetwater from the u.s on November 2020 to have a foot in the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana. Tilray on the other hand is trying to get into other countries for it's medical marijuana and got a great deal when they gave tilray the permission to distribute it's medical marijuana in the united Kingdom on February 2021. Tilray has more countries to distribute it's medical marijuana and it also bought Manitoba Harvest to also have a foot into the u.s when they legalize recreational marijuana, it's easy to look up this information. But germany and Canada are the biggest market for both aphria and tilray. The reason why am naming this two countries is because ladies and gentleman this two countries have been in lockdowns and so have other European nations in these past months. What the hell does that matter some may say, well if these countries went into lockdowns how can aphria and tilray make money. That's the reason why thier sales went down by alot this past quarter because they had no control over these lockdowns. You can check how much money aphria and tilray made in sales in 2020 and compare. Once these lockdowns have been lifted they will again start to make what they have been making. Aphria and tilray weren't named the biggest company based on sales for no reason. They will clearly be one of the leaders in the cannabis industry. I really can't understand how Canopy is valued at $40 while the new tilray is trading below $15 , which to me is dirt cheap. Tilray just reported out it's first quarter but people have to understand that they just reported the old tilray sales and not the new tilray ( aphria and tilray). As these lockdowns have been lifted and Europe is starting to open and the ceo Irwin simons and his managers start to manage the new tilray I see the company price jumping up close to where these past analyst are putting thier fair value price targets easily. I am in no means a financial advisor or an expert. Am just an informed trader and all the information I just gave can be easily looked up online. People have to get informed before making trades so please trade at your own risk and always verify any information you look up online."

Even IF it's ahead of the curve (big if) there are *billions* of dollars going in to catching up by the same aforementioned companies.

Yep. Again, with lots of competitors. They got some government contracts. Thats a nice start. There is a LONG LONG way to go.

Start by buying an insurance company. **STOP.**  Imagine people paying you money up front for something that may or may not happen in the future? You take that money and invest it to make more money. In the unlikely event that said insured event occurs (I'm not kidding my Florida homeowners doesn't cover flood...that's a separate policy...but it does cover **volcanic eruption** so if Florida suddenly becomes Hawaii and a volcano rises up on US 1 and spews lava and burns my house to the ground I'm covered for that.  WTF? **)** they will find every excuse not to pay you after your deductible, co-pay, etc.  Call em for some customer service and you will get a cheery delightful phone conversation with someone in Guam, but you will not get any money.

It's essentially government sanctioned (and in most cases required) extortion. From it's conception centuries ago the insurance racket has long been one of the most profitable businesses on the Earth.

tl:dr I'm not sure if Warren Buffet is a genius for buying an insurance company, but I'm absolutely certain the guy who **invented** the idea of insurance was."

They're simply head and shoulder above everybody else in terms of NPS.

I haven't done DD on Clover, but based on what I've seen (I have parents who is on Clover and were on Humana), their capability is not even what 1/20th of what Humana has to offer.  Their digital experience is very bare.  They do not have their own mail order pharmacy, and instead relies on CVS/Caremark.  Same goes for medicare OTC/supplement.

Without significant investment, their primary ammunition is competing on prices as result of their lower overhead, but I don't know how sustainable that is."

2021-05-13 09:22:42,wallstreetbets,"Awesome! Good for you. 

Blink is actually forecasted to go up, even though it's been sliding lately. Blink's earnings have actually been *up* recently. As is Doordash, and I'd expect with the number of people ordering out thanks to the Rona their earnings should be up. In fact they're expecting elevation. 

Airbnb though, whew lads. I'd say that's a risky one. It's been getting hammered thanks to travel restrictions. However, with things opening up now, they may be looking at a rebound. So the question is, do other investors think the same, even if it's a big miss on profits? Might even be worth it to watch and buy a dip, because people are going crazy thanks to the absolute shit year 2020 was and won't care what rental they get into. Could actually be a *buying opportunity*. The only reason I can think of it dropping is that they miss their earnings and the algos kick in and sell. Or investors get spooked because govts are looking at cracking down because people are bitching about rentals in their suburban shitholes. 

I'd say the only one that's likely to drop is Airbnb out of the three. It's definitely riskier than your Wish short. But if I was shorting one of those three, it would be that one."

The squeeze momentum was halted when brokerages ran out of liquidity to handle the influx. Yes, the majority of shorts did cover during that period. The volume was enormous (plenty to cover every short that wanted out), and the hedge funds involved reported enormous realized losses.

You read that correctly 123m shares borrowed, which is astonishing. Up 25% from a week ago. So that‚Äôs about ~2.5$ billion, and it keep going up, not many funds can survive such a loss and their positions are underwater. Yesterday someone borrowed 200million around lunch time... deep pockets behind this. There not just betting against a stock their betting against historic steel prices on a company that is positioned to have a huge windfall, a potential infrastructure bill, plus $clf is getting pumped consistently on Cramer. it‚Äôs odd the disconnect.

2021-05-12 23:35:00,wallstreetbets,"Not OP but CLF recently acquired a bunch of MTs steel plants and have undergone a pretty major restructuring. They are vertically integrated meaning they don‚Äôt have to buy scrap iron like NUE in order to make their steel. China recently started buying up all the scrap, which means NUE has to compete with them which might hurt their margins. Steel companies are making money hand over fist right now and the CEO of CLF has repeatedly stated they will spend Q2 paying down debt rapidly and then transition  to stock buybacks in Q3. Because of this CLF is a long term play and I think we will see them skyrocket 3-6 months from now. This is not a short term play. NUE can be a good play as well probably though. 

I would be surprised if CLF isn‚Äôt trading at $40 by EOY, but then again I just took my biggest ever L in a day in the market today so you probably shouldn‚Äôt listen to me"

Just asking, because you're green as fuck mate."
2021-05-13 10:33:51,wallstreetbets,"I apologize, apparently I get somewhat vicious if I see posts like... yours. 

I just look at the facts and official numbers instead of spreading opinionated misinformation.

-AMC current cost to borrow (Ortex): 217% -AMC current utilization: 100% for the last several days -AMC has just reported the first quarter with 1 billion in liquidity, a record in its 101 years of business. This will fund the theatre chain easily for the next 20 months. -AMC recorded +3 million individual investors 2 MONTHS ago with +80% retail ownership. Both those numbers being a lot higher now.

SEC will most likely never again allow Hedge funds to short this bad without proper collateral because now they are as you said ‚Äúliterally fucked.‚Äù Don‚Äôt miss out."
2021-05-13 11:05:54,wallstreetbets,"It has a billion in liquidity that it 

A) borrowed  
B) stole from shareholders  

It owes 500m of that liquidity back. That wasn't a gift. It's debt.

Also... 20 months? What the fuck did you pull that from. It barely lasted them a few months last year.

Cost to borrow means that people *want to short it*.

People *shorted it knowing the cost to borrow was high*. Why? Because they think it's overvalued. Why? Because its market cap is triple what it was in 2016, but its business is going to be suboptimal for the next 2-3 years.

Retail ownership doesn't really make any difference..."
2021-05-13 12:10:31,wallstreetbets,"Haha so if a company uses the money it‚Äôs shareholders invested, it‚Äôs called stealing now? Everyone investing in AMC is well aware of the debt as well, including Blackrock and Vanguard, the 2 biggest investors in Disney. 

20 months comes from the recent earnings report where the CEO reported the 1 billion in liquidity and stated this would last then through 2022. That‚Äôs 19.5 months from now.

Cost to borrow is just the cost to borrow... there‚Äôs always a cost to borrow, it‚Äôs a form of measurement. One of the main reasons people are investing in this stock is BECAUSE it‚Äôs been so heavily shorted. And it‚Äôs been shorted since pre pandemic. Hundreds of millions of borrowed shares and any synthetic shares produced to keep the price down (some estimate could be over a billion since hedge funds like Citadel and Melvin Capital have been using dark pool trading to stay under the radar) will have to be bought eventually. Now that there‚Äôs millions of people beginning to notice the tactics these hedge funds use and the close relationship they‚Äôve had with the SEC, I‚Äôm not surprised they‚Äôve chosen to select a new chairmen, voted some new laws in that will hinder this type of unfair financial warfare, and are currently closing dark pool trading giving them less than two weeks to vacate their positions. Oh and investigating the HF‚Äôs mentioned above. 

The buy/sell ratio has been heavily a buy yet the price doesn‚Äôt change? 

Retail ownership is ALL the difference my friend. And retail have caught the shorts with their pants down, outnumbered, outgunned, over leveraged. If I had to guess, some margin calls are on their way. However, I‚Äôll wait years for this squeeze if need be, and worst case scenario break even. Easiest bet of my life."
2021-05-13 12:25:25,wallstreetbets,"Oof, the 43 million shares were just sold into the market today, and amc raised 428 million in cash. That‚Äôs almost all of the 500m liquidity it owes! It‚Äôs gonna be a good time here soon man, I wouldn‚Äôt take the chance on getting horrible fomo when you have someone like me warning you beforehand"

2021-05-13 06:30:40,wallstreetbets,"A Call is a bet a stock will go up, is how I remember it. 

Another good example I read awhile ago was buying a house. I list my house for $500k. You tell me you‚Äôll pay me $5k (premium) right now, to hold the house for 3 months. In those 3 months, you can buy the house for $500k (strike price) no matter if the houses value rises or falls. Whether you buy the house or not, you‚Äôre out of $5k. 

Say for some reason the value of the house shoots up, it‚Äôs now worth $900k. I still have to honor our deal and sell it to you for $500k. You can then turn around and sell the house for $900k, making profit. 

Maybe the value of the house goes down, and you decide not to buy it. 

If after 3 months, you don‚Äôt want to buy it, our contract expires and I can sell it to whomever for however much I want. 

Just the key part with Calls and Puts (bet a stock will go down), it‚Äôs 100 or more shares.

Edit: terms"

By selecting this account type, your available cash is used to pay for your trades before creating a margin loan for you.

2021-05-13 15:32:03,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a Wendy's...

OK... I'm not an expert, but I think I understand calls pretty well.  Puts are still a bit of a mystery to me but are, theoretically, the opposite of calls (still not sure how that works out).

Calls are options to buy 100 shares of a stock at a given price at any time until their expiration date.  So, if stock A is trading at $10 each and I think it will go up to $20 each in a month, I might buy $12 calls that expire in a month.  Each call would sell for a small amount, so if each one sold for $0.10, I could buy 10 calls for much cheaper than I could buy 1000 shares.  If the price goes up, I could then either sell the calls (their worth would go up proportionally) or, if I had the money, exercise them and buy the shares (this is called being ""In The Money"" or ITM).  If the price doesn't go up enough, then it's cheaper to buy shares directly rather than exercising the calls (this is called being ""Out of The Money"" or OTM).

So call options run the risk of being worth $0 and you've just lost the money you spent buying them... or they could be worth a ton of money (this is partly how DFV leveraged his way up from a $53,000 investment to multi-millions of $ and 200,000 shares of GME).

As I said, puts are theoretically the inverse... it's betting the price will go down below a certain level... but I still struggle to really wrap my head around how they work.

Hope that helps a bit."

2021-05-13 16:39:49,wallstreetbets,"A lot wrong with what you said. Firstly, Gamestops prices are much more competitive than Amazon and they offer same day delivery. Some games are going for less than half of what Amazon offers. Second, unlike Amazon, GME is commited to gaming and are the only major player doing this so they can offer bundles and benefits that Amazon will never be able to compete with aside from esports at their thousands of locations. Third, they sell games for all console so don't understand what you mean by mid gen, and they sell computers hardware and accessories so you can build your own beast or they can for you at no extra charge. Fourthly, aside from GME being the only real player in a multibillion dollar industry with massive growth potential being led by someone who we trust knows what he's doing because of his track record which is much more reliable than your opinion of GME, the stock is disproportionately shorted. And anyone with any common sense would understand that to have a community of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of investors willing to hold with you to squeeze the shorts is better than trying your luck in the corrupt market all on your own. Youre not even a small fish in the sea, you're hardly a grain of sand. Tell me, how many stocks are you invested in that you know millions of others investors will hold with you until you have all succeeded? Name one stock you have such confidence. My guess is zero, and so you're just trying your luck hoping and praying g that people do something that will help your solo cause."
2021-05-13 16:40:49,wallstreetbets,"Everyone buys games from the consoles retard.

I meant Amazon for accessories."
2021-05-13 17:00:42,wallstreetbets,"Wrong again. It makes more sense buy a physical copy because you can resell it and recover most of your original investment in the game. Consoles push digital so that everyone who wants to play has to buy a copy and always pay full price, where as physical copies are actually a far better option for regular gamers. But that aside, GME prices for accessories are also much more competative so you you don't have a point. Also, again, I gave many reasons, not just one"

2021-05-13 08:49:52,wallstreetbets,"A 720 in subprime was never seen. What you‚Äôre taking about is an alt-a program or possibly a conforming stated.

At LongBeach we were funding 22m a month, average credit score 540, loan value 67k. 

If the income didn‚Äôt come out right we calculated 2080 or 2040. We needed more money get a first months payment and security deposit with a rental agreement. Needed more money let‚Äôs get a CPA to write on letterhead you‚Äôre own a business and use your deposits to make up the difference.

2021-05-12 23:27:56,wallstreetbets,"I think this has so much potential in the USA for growth moving forward...  It has been mostly International, but so much is now growing in the US especially with Foley connections and now WYNNBETS going SPAC with Foley and PSFE becomes the transaction arm...  All the US States passing online gaming..  All positive revenue in a space that PSFE has never really touched...  So this just has so many positive growth points that we all will be laughing about the teen's....  Its hard to really bash anything, yeah we probably all wish this was 20's or high teen's before ER call, yeah it should have spiked when merger happened or even ticker change.. but the market shifted, the market has corrected a few times this year, the last 2 days have been a blood bath...  ER call on a day when the market is tanking...  Dow was over 400 down that day too..  All in all you have to believe in the growth and be happy you got in at the 10-18$ range... if this went IPO retail probably wouldnt even get in until the stock was $60 or more. I think if you do the research and pick a solid company with solid future growth, SPACS are amazing because I couldn't hold 18K+ shares if the stock was $60... or more..  Or even hold 10K of shares...  being 10-16 or 18 give me opportunity to hold a lot of shares...  So I think this is a winner but everyone has their reasons...  Everyone has their winners and losers..  We just have to sit back, wait for the market to correct itself, wait for inflation to work its self into the market and know this is going to take off.. just might be a little longer than many including I thought this would be.. but the more I hear foley talk the more I see where this is headed, I'll wait..

It is making crazy money. The people that run it ate extremely smart and all you have to do is look at how they got traction. 
They couldn't get any channel to show their fights so they did a reality TV show and got in through the back door.
The whole world basically shit down including every major sporting event on the planet...except for the UFC. They simply went to the middle east bought an island and put on fights on ""Fight Island"".
Love them or hate them there is no denying that these people are the best at what they do.
Say what you want about fighters pay but McGregor made 180m last year. Yes not as money earned from fighting but without the UFC no one would have known his name.
Jon Jones is now asking for 30m to fight Francis. The top guys make money and the rest see the potential and that's why they are there.
