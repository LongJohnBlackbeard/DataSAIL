2021-06-10 18:37:56,stocks,"In the huge long term like 20 years I still see oil rising(if it includes synthetics) even though society is pushing away from oil as use for combustion energy I can’t see us completely ditching it. Machinery lubricants(this shit will always grow bigger and more complex), producing plastics(these aren’t ever going away once we go back to paper we’re going back to plastic because the trees),and roads(one of the final recycled uses) are some of the uses that will require more demand as populations rise.

2021-06-10 18:35:05,stocks,"The only oil companies I own are RDS and Equinor, those are the ones I think will be the best in the renewables category. I'm personally are betting big on oil futures right now, I expect it to have a great run up up to 100 but I expect commodities to get crushed once the reopening boom wears off so as a short term play I like oil. Also I'm fairly confident a republican sweep will happen in 2022, many moderate dems I'm talking to are very disappointed and will vote for almost any non trump Republican (and btw this is not ment to be political when investing its best to go with what you think will happen not what you want to happen)"

2021-06-10 18:32:04,stocks,I bought CVX around the same time and sold out in March of this year. I think we will continue to see growth over the next year or two but the growth will be significantly reduced in comparison to last year. I see many of these companies earnings coming closer to pre-pandemic levels within the next 18 months but again the earnings growth will be much slower. I sold because I believe there is areas to find a better return at this point.

2021-06-10 19:41:27,stocks,"The benefits of margin are day trading and not having to wait for cash to settle to use it. 

If you keep your margin account I would keep everything in it and if you ever removed it everything would be moved to cash anyways. 

Careful with day trading though. Buying and selling the same security multiple times on a short period can mark you as a day trader which then requires you to keep 25k minimum in your account. 

Also websites like fidelity have pretty nice videos that you can watch"

2021-06-10 19:37:56,stocks,"I understand that portion of it.  I guess my confusion is just in the fact that i now have shares classified as ""margin"" or ""cash"", even when those shares are not bought using the margin.  Does it make sense to put them all into margin to help with that unsettled cash thing then?"
2021-06-10 17:47:18,stocks,Earnings can be manipulated with accruals and recognition standards. Cash flow on the other hand is much harder to manipulate. I love CFO.

2021-06-10 18:23:50,stocks,"Depends on the situation, IV is up today which was a great day to roll"
2021-06-10 19:05:43,stocks,"There are ETFs that can be as broad or as narrow as you like.

There is no secret sauce to diversification, you just have to pick a strategy and roll with it.

I'd say most people use SPY/VOO or VTI as a portfolio default position, then maybe make bets on individual stocks or ETFs that they think will outperform--assuming we're not talking about fixed-income strategies.

If your strategy is world-level representative diversification, 85% into VXUS and 15% into VTI would get you in the ballpark (U.S. is 15%ish of world GDP).

It starts to get more difficult the more granular you want to get. Like, let's say you want a 50/50 US/World split and a 33.3% even split between large/mid/small.  So your splits would be 16.5% by 6 different ETFs. E.g.:

World-large: SPDW

World-mid: VSS

World-small: GWX

US-large: VTI

US-mid: SCHM

US-small: VB

You could probably further break down every one of those into value/growth splits if you really wanted to, but then you're talking about 12 different ETFs you have to keep track of.

Or you could do something truly bonkers like counting every publicly-traded company in the world on every market and dividing your available cash by that number, which would give you a per-ticker spend. Then buy an equal-sized (by dollar) fractional share in every company in the world. (Let's disregard transaction fees on that one.)

P.S. Global X if you're listening, get on this and make an ETF with the ticker DAF: Diversified As Fuck."
2021-06-10 17:50:04,stocks,"There is so much cash at the front of the curve and low T-Bill supply from the TGA pay down that money market funds have no where else to go but the Fed RRP. It is less painful than potentially have to earn negative rates on your cash.

Imagine you are a money market fund manager and you have $500 million cash. This cash came from a bank like Goldman who is looking to reduce its balance sheet constraint from a recent large deposit from a client and is charging deposit fees (negative rates). Ok so now what? I have all this cash and will have to pay this fee to Goldman unless I do something with it. Since there are no interest options given the abundance of cash across the market, you go to the RRP at 0% Better than earning nothing and having to pay fees right?

Why not just buy t-bills if you are a MMF? Well, because of the TGA pay down, there is just not enough bill supply out there. This has been the issue since April and why you have seen a dramatic rise in the RRP facility 

The Fed needs to taper. Their overnight reverse repo facility hit over half a trillion dollars this week."
2021-06-10 18:59:30,stocks,"Perhaps I'm dense but can you expand upon this a bit more? 

Who is taking out these RR positions, the primary brokers such as Goldman, right? The RR report states that there are only like 50 members participating so it's not the money market fund managers initiating these things (there would be way more than 50).

Why is Goldman charging deposit fees? Don't they want cash to then invest and earn returns on? Doesn't more cash mean more capital which means more potential returns?

The way I interpret it is that the reason a primary broker (bank) initiates a RR is because they are sitting on so much cash and they don't see anywhere promising to invest it at the moment (promising meaning acceptable return given associated risk). Seems to me to indicate pretty bearish sentiment, no?"
2021-06-10 18:13:11,stocks,"Makes some sense. 

Why does the amount keep increasing each week recently? I’ve seen it compared to the last recession, though I’m not sure in what way? What happens if it just keeps increasing to $1 trillion?"

2021-06-10 16:38:49,stocks,"The way its worded is it is making it sound like shareholders are receiving compensation for holding shares when stock splits are not like that all. Lets say you have 5 shares of X company for $500 a share. Which is $2,500 invested. The company announces a 5 to 1 stock split so every 1 share becomes 5. Now you have 25 shares for $100.00 each. So nothing really changes because your value in the company is still $2,500 dollars.

If I remember correctly it may have momentarily ticked up after the restructuring but hasn't moved much outside of it's current range of ~$23 in months.

2021-06-10 17:10:14,stocks,Can you elaborate on that? Do you mean because a lot of people feel that way the value is bought up higher than it should be at the present moment so there is less room for mobility in the future?

What's stopping me investing at the moment is the massively risen cost of shipment that has happened. I have a few orders from alibaba that haven't even been shipped from China yet and I believe that this is why.

The main thing that Baba has going for it is that it ships things that are so cheap compared to the goods you could otherwise buy.

The problem is if their shipping costs run up massively and stay high they may not longer maintain this competitive advantage.

I'll admit I haven't done a full analysis of this company. But if I wanted more exposure to their kind of business I would definitely worry about this"
2021-06-10 14:09:12,stocks,"Easy. It's a Chinese company but Chinese people can't buy the stock because it's not listed in China. Imagine the price of Amazon if Americans weren't able to buy it. 

When BABA is added to Stock Connect on HKEX, 1.4 billion Chinese will be able to buy it, like they already can with Tencent.

Soon after that BABA will moon."
2021-06-10 14:09:59,stocks,"Perhaps it's at fair value. It trades at a PE of 25 currently. There are a million more things to look at than just that metric, but we're in a market with a lot of new investors who think a 70 PE is realistic. 25 is still on the high end historically. Add the standard discount for Chinese stock with conflict with the western world and their own government oversight, this is a fine spot for it to trade at."

2021-06-10 16:21:01,stocks,"There is one big bear point and that is: China

I wouldn't touch Chinese companies with a 10 foot pole. I don't care how undervalued they are; we've seen that they can't be trusted and the risk of the Chinese government doing something to screw over my investment is too high especially given that Americans can't even really own the shares of Chinese companies.

And it is just not worth the stress of having to always worry about what is going on in some other country with an unpredictable government when there are plenty of great American companies that I can invest in that are easier to stay well-informed about and don't carry that kind of risk which would keep me up at night.

I'm pretty sure many other people feel the same about investing in China."

I honestly believe there are many undervalued small to midcap innovative Chinese tech companies that could easily be valued at over 25 billion USD and I wouldn't be surprised. There's the country risk that everyone talks about, but that's the whole reason companies like it are undervalued. High risk very high reward. Companies like HUYA, WIMI, ZEPP, DOYU, JKS, JWEL, IFBD, MOMO, BLCT, MKD, etc. A ton of cheap innovation with high gains potential. There could be a smear campaign going on to keep these shares cheap long enough for rich connected folk to get all their money in. It obviously isn't a certainty, but worth the gamble if you ask me."

I don't like to take too big a position in any one stock for risk management, but I agree that it looks cheap.  AMZN is trading at 64 PE vs 25 for BABA.  I know that's not everything, but seems cheap with their growth.  Charlie Munger has been buying it, so there is that.  

The main risks I've read about just seem to be China communist related, but I can't see them doing anything to severely hurt the company.  I think they are just trying to let everyone know who really holds the power.  The latest fine seems like a pittance for a company that size and from what I can tell, the business is growing rapidly.  

But I don't really know.  There are plenty of shenanigans in the US market, adding China to the mix makes people even more uncomfortable."

2021-06-10 15:01:05,stocks,Yeah this is a good point Tmall and Taobao are the real profit makers
2021-06-10 15:55:30,stocks,">Tmall and Taobao account for most of their revenue.

Hadn't heard of these. This is a good point and interesting. 

>Also, Alibaba isn’t shipping the items, the supplier is.

Agreed. But it would still hit their bottom line if their was less demand. It'd be like if amazon suddenly sold half as many things through their platform. Sure they're not selling directly but it still hurts"
2021-06-10 15:59:49,stocks,"This is true. I hadn't looked into it enough to know this. However losing even 10% is still a bit of a hit. Probably not enough to make it a bad investment, though."
2021-06-10 14:59:01,stocks,HKEX is not accessible for most Chinese. But certain stocks on there are included in the Stock Connect program which let's mainland retail investors buy them.
2021-06-10 18:48:56,stocks,Is that historically high or low?
2021-06-10 18:02:54,stocks,What was the pe before the fine?
2021-06-10 18:03:29,stocks,Can others confirm this is indeed the case?
2021-06-10 19:11:17,stocks,"Yeah and in nuclear winter everyone dies. Just like the stock market isnt always rational, geopolitics aint either. And personally, it can stay irrational longer than my portfolio can stay solvent.

And even if you think joe bidu is going to leave BABA alone, there's no guarantee that winnie the hu is going to leave BABA alone, as evidenced by this year.

OP wanted a bearish case, that's what OP gets. Our CEOs tweet crazy shit, theirs go missing for a few months 🤷🏻‍♂️.

If you can predict US and Chinese geopolitics the  go for it, I guess. I can't even predict state politics that affect local businesses, so ill stick with boomer stocks like Coca Cola or something."
2021-06-10 19:25:38,stocks,"> Do you really think USA capitalism can exist without China at this point?

Banning investment in Chinese companies != banning trade with China.  So, yes, U.S. capitalism could absolutely survive banning investment in Chinese companies.  Banning trade is a non-starter.

That being said, completely banning investment in China would be a pretty extreme measure and would dramatically escalate an already tense situation.  I think things would have to get quite a bit worse before Biden considered a total ban.  However, the more tensions increase the greater the risk becomes and the market will price that risk in.

> You ban BABA and if they ban APPL, its gonna be nuclear winter on NYSE.

Chinese investment in the U.S. is orders of magnitude smaller than U.S. investment in China.  Chinese investors exiting AAPL would barely dent AAPL's SP.  U.S. investors exiting BABA would smash BABA's SP.  It might be Nuclear Winter on the HKEX, but the NYSE would be just fine."
2021-06-10 19:03:28,stocks,"Not saying I disagree with your point cause I think he APPL one is a great one, but don’t they produce a lot of phones in other countries too? I’m curious if hypothetically they could only send phones from countries besides China how that would effect their sales or stock for demand. I honestly don’t think that much, but still I am curious nonetheless."

2021-06-10 15:21:06,stocks,Does BABA not encompass those two companies as well?
2021-06-10 18:08:28,stocks,"Just 190, and the year before 290. Of course it had a revenue growth of 30-50% yearly so a high PE is expected.

Actually a PE of 25 is the best value BABA ever had ..."

2021-06-10 19:15:42,stocks,"Jack Ma is not the CEO anymore.

But yeah, both countries will lose massively by starting banning more and more companies. China has production capacity and USA has the brains. But China has consistently surprised everyone with their in-house tech like high speed rail, their own passenger planes, smartphones, fintech and what not. The fact that BRK hasn't opened a huge position in BABA at this point is also not a good thing. The stock is at absolutely crazy low level IMO. 

BABA is not just BABA. They have an inter-web of investments in some of the largest startups in the SEA region. BABA is early and lead investor in 4 out 6 most valued Indian startups for example."

2021-06-10 18:54:10,stocks,"Forward PE is only 22.5

Its criminally low given the product and the market it rules in. China has the best infra on the planet right now and the largest growing middle class as well. Not sure what kind of hit they took because of covid though since they don't share data openly. Which is also a big reason why people dont invest in them."
2021-06-10 14:34:41,stocks,"1. This is only Webull, not full market
2. Buyers = Sellers every single day so there is no imbalance of buyers and sellers... in order for someone to buy, people need to sell. Price changes in a stock come from depth of market and current willingness of participants to buy/sell/hold at a given price"
2021-06-10 14:02:23,stocks,"Have you considered that maybe, just maybe, Webull doesn't oversee 100% of the trading volume for AMC?

For example, in your snapshots on June 9 it shows $1.83m USD in volume forAMC while on yahoo finance it shows 149m shares traded that day; so it would appear that you are only analyzing a small fraction of the overall picture for AMC trade volume. It would appear that in reality there are far more sellers than buyers.

\*Edit: Accidently mentioned GME two out of three times. Meant AMC."
2021-06-10 14:14:09,stocks,As someone else pointed out this is only inflow/outflow for Webull not the entire market.  For every buy there is a sell.  Shares and money are just traded between accounts.  Every dollar that goes into AMC is also a dollar going out.  There is no net inflow or net outflow.  The price moves based on if buyers are willing to pay more or less and if sellers are willing to take more or less at any given point in time.  There may be more willing buyers than sellers or more willing sellers than buyers but there will always the same number of trades/shares/dollars for buys and sells.
2021-06-10 13:45:59,stocks,"There's also some influence from options, futures, puts and calls. But the truth is most of what you heard is spot on and unexplainable at this time due to the fact that we have no clue what goes on in dark pools and there is a lot of criminal naked shorting going on."
2021-06-10 14:26:22,stocks,"I think you misunderstand inflows / outflows. In reality, there is no money put ""into"" or pulled ""out"" of a stock. There is a buyer and seller in every trades. Money goes from the buyer to the seller. The only thing that determines what is considered ""in"" and ""out"" is whoever is the market maker and whoever is the taker. If there are more inflows than outflows, it just means more buyers are making market buys, while more sellers are using limits / providing liquidity.

For example, I could buy 10 shares of ABC at $10, then turn around and dump the 10 shares for $9. I bough $100 worth and sold $90 worth, but the price went down. But the total money transacted is net 0, $100 from me to the seller, and $90 from the buyer to me."

2021-06-10 16:15:48,stocks,"Let this be a lesson that there are not always buyers. 
All to often I see people talking about these meme stocks reaching 1mil a share. If that were to happen, I see many sellers, and zero buyers."
2021-06-10 17:19:22,stocks,"I'm glad you asked this, as a new trader on webull I've been looking at these stats a lot and had no idea it was just whats happening with webull users. Blindspot. 

Where can we go to look at more holistic data for the flow and not just what webull is doing?"
2021-06-10 18:20:46,stocks,"Other people have answered your question already but I would like to add a little comment:

Stock price is determined by last price paid. There is no inflow vs outflow or total buyers vs total sellers."
2021-06-10 17:57:28,stocks,"When a share is sold short, it is borrowed from person A by person B and sold to Person C. Now there are two shares one held by person A, but it's on loan, and one by person C. Wouldn't this increase in supply lower the stock price by laws of supply and demand?"
2021-06-10 14:36:35,stocks,Makes sense. I didnt realize the inflow/outflow chart was only for Webull and misunderstood how it worked. Whats the purpose of a chart like that if its only showing stats on Webull? What am I supposed to do with that info and why would i need it?
2021-06-10 15:57:27,stocks,"Not if there are naked shorts being created. Then they are decreasing the price artificially using made up shares. But go ahead rattle on how it's not influencing the markets, etc. etc."
2021-06-10 14:54:19,stocks,He’s talking about amc not gme but yes same thing holds for that too
2021-06-10 14:21:46,stocks,"I didnt realize that. I thought the inflow/outflow was for the whole market, again still learning.

Whats the purpose of the chart then, and how would I use the info for instance shown on the Webull inflow/outflow chart? If im understand it correctly its not exactly showing manipulation going on if inflow is larger than out and price is still going down, its just showing how many buy orders vs sell orders on Webull specifically. Why would I care what that info is if its only covering Webull?"
2021-06-10 13:53:33,stocks,"If that's the case with it being so easily seen in an inflow/outflow chart why has it not been investigated already? I'm really hesitant to call something a conspiracy and to claim everyone is in the HF's pocket. 

Seems like a huge risk for anyone trying to manipulate the market on a stock that's the center of the countries attention right now."

2021-06-10 18:59:19,stocks,"You do realize the point in a squeeze right? SHFs have to cover when they can't meet their margin call, hence the price being whatever sellers want to sell at if no one is selling for a loss..."
2021-06-10 17:35:08,stocks,"The first reply mentions Yahoo Finance, probably other large well known media companies too. Of course this could be a case of the blind leading the blind here and I'm wrong about Yahoo Finance being somewhere to go for that."
2021-06-10 15:13:04,stocks,They're just trying to give you a sense of what other webull users are doing. I would in no way trade off that information but for instance if you see mostly outflows in a name one day and you're not sure why you could use it as a signal to make sure you aren't missing anything news/filings wise
2021-06-10 16:22:04,stocks,"No

Edit: even if you think they don’t have borrow on the stock they’re still selling those shares to someone who is buying them."
2021-06-10 15:01:05,stocks,yeah that was my bad. I still meant AMC.
2021-06-10 14:58:46,stocks,Because people like data and people like patterns and trends.  Maybe you could detect a trend based on behavior.  For example Webull is only going to have retail traders.  No institutions or large money investors are going to be using it.  So when inflows are higher that means retail is jumping on (and the others are jumping out).  Maybe that means something to you etc.  Maybe you want to be on the side of retail.  Maybe you want to be on the other side against retail.  I personally wouldn't give merit to any of it but I am a fundamentals person and not a technical trader.
2021-06-10 16:03:11,stocks,Don't listen to all these conspiracy theory cultists
2021-06-10 15:53:41,stocks,The SEC doesn’t particularly care and isn’t actually acting in the interests of retail investors.

2021-06-10 15:25:12,stocks,Thankfully I haven't used it as a source for decision making. Its just mentioned A LOT in the Webull comments as if it means something and I take everything said there with a spoon of salt so I was trying to get to bottom of it. I'm surprised how little info I could find on inflow/outflow and now I know why.
2021-06-10 16:25:52,stocks,"I hate that everyone on here pedals naked shorting and short squeezes but... if you MUST.. think of it like kiting checks... If I open a credit card and buy $10k worth of stuff, then open up another line of credit to pay that off, and another to pay that off and keep doing that on and on... its bad - I don't have the money and its ultimately not good, but that money I'm using to buy goods/services is still purchasing good and those goods are being sold to me and that company is recording revenues.  


There has to be a buy/seller in every transaction"
2021-06-10 15:30:08,stocks,"Is there a good source you know of that can explain the fundamentals or just how to properly read financial reports and all that stuff in really easy terms? And in turn helping myself make decisions rather than having blind trust in strangers on the internet?

2021-06-10 15:05:50,stocks,The stipulations of the consolidation should be laid out. You should be able to access the information through your broker. Either that or buy or sell 2 shares to make it simple.
2021-06-10 19:29:24,stocks,"Why do they call these reverse stock splits and not something a little more intuitive like share merger, or share consolidation? Seems like a round about way to say the same shit."

2021-06-10 14:50:38,stocks,"I would add that in a lot of reverse split situations the round down and no cash payment for fractional shares is the norm. If a company is doing a reverse split and it isn't someone like GE, things are usually pretty damned bad."
2021-06-10 14:57:50,stocks,This is true.  Depends alot on the reason for the split in most cases.

2021-06-10 13:55:56,stocks,Sounds like you need to be doing more research into the companies you’re buying honestly.
2021-06-10 13:36:12,stocks,Obviously depends on what are you investing and how long you've started.
2021-06-10 14:44:16,stocks,"Hey man I’m right there with you.  Stared in Jan, took my medicine when GME crashed, subsequently spent months reading, learning and creating a portfolio.  

The best advice I’ve been given is know your investment.  If you believe the company you have invested in has strong fundamentals and a good chance of success in future, hold it and don’t worry too much about short term volatility.

That being said, definitely a good idea to balance between safer index funds and ETFs (I like VTI personally) as well as individual stocks.  

Lastly, don’t worry about the negative comments.  The last few months have seen unbelievable spikes and dips that have caught seasoned investors off guard.  Know what you’re buying into and play the long game"
2021-06-10 16:24:19,stocks,"Depends on your style.

Do you just want to put money into your broker account and forget about it? Dump all your money into ETF that tracks an index fund like VTI, VOO/SPY or QQQ. Drump your money there and forget about it. Check once in a while and you will be fine with an average of 10-13% per year.

Or

Do you have time to track and check stocks? Then make a watch list, check out stocks you like or know something about. For example, if you are in the field of medicine, buy healthcare related stocks because you will know better than the average joe about such companies and you will not sell if there is a drop because you believe in such stock.

Or

You have a lot of time, to track the stock in the day/night. Then make a watch list and track stocks that goes up and down and swing trade, buy low, sell high. Mix with some option trading (stick to sell cash reserve puts and covered calls, in the begining, dont YOLO). Mix with holding some stocks you know they are ""undervalue.""

TIP: dont buy when the stock is going up and up, stocks normally correct itself and will drop no matter how bullish the stock is. It will drop and when it does, its nasty, around 2-3%. Wait for the right time to go in.

My best advice is to follow a stock for a week or so, and understand its support and resistence level and buy when you feel its hitting a support level once the stock correct itself (dip).

Many ways to make money. All of them are valid and it depends on you."
2021-06-10 13:23:47,stocks,You should go visit r/bogleheads to be honest. It'll save you a lot of headaches and make you a lot of money in the long run
2021-06-10 15:16:43,stocks,Just go with VOO for a huge chunk of your portfolio..
2021-06-10 16:45:43,stocks,"Read One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch.  It will help you pick stocks better.  He teaches you to build a story around the company, and he sells when the story changes or plays out.

If you’re trying to get into value investing, watch out for value traps and don’t buy stocks with super low trading volume otherwise it will just sit at the same price for years.

Also look on OpenInsider for insider purchases.  Sometimes you’ll see a CEO buy a chunk of shares  and a few weeks later the price will jump.  It happened with JOAN BBBY HOG and TAP a few months ago and with CYCN and MICT this week.  Just make sure you buy around the same price they did."

2021-06-10 14:32:33,stocks,"Depends on what you're buying, and your risk tolerance.

Remember that the people making a ton of money on the meme stocks are either really lucky, or focus on a single play over a period of time.

For example, anyone who's been in AMC since Jan made a lot, but they needed to stay in, and consistently timed their buys correctly. All while risking getting wiped out from having their eggs in one basket."
2021-06-10 13:51:53,stocks,"Not financial advice but I put a large percentage of my portfolio in an index fund like VT that covers the whole market. It's boring, but it will produce good gains over a large amount of time. I just play around with stocks with 15% of my portfolio.

Check out r/ETFs if you're interested."
2021-06-10 13:39:17,stocks,I started jan 30 and im up 200%. Depends on your decisions. Most seasoned investors have told me my decisions are horrible decisions this year. So idk. I keep seeing fat gains and not understanding these seasoned guys problem with it

you're going to worry just as much about when to sell you gains as you are when your stocks are down. but generally this is a waiting game and patience is rewarded."
2021-06-10 14:03:49,stocks,Sell some covered calls against your positions to hedge continued downside.
2021-06-10 14:08:41,stocks,"Personally if my stocks go down, I often times buy more - I have long-term confidence in them and view decreases as 'gifts' if you will.  
You may be better off selling losses on the last day of the year, as you can (should?) use them to off-set gains. If you sell your losses (and have gains) you write a smaller check to Uncle Sam for that tax year."
2021-06-10 17:23:30,stocks,The book covers this. It covers everything. Just read it.
2021-06-10 19:38:31,stocks,"First and foremost, what kind of companies are you currently buying into? Are they long-standing companies with proven growth and positive balance sheets, or are they companies you are trying to “get tendies” with? 

With so much recent hype centered around retail traders, a lot people have been treating the market like a casino.

My advice would be to find 5-10 companies that you personally believe in; companies you would spend money with and/or already spend money with. Comb through their financials a bit, research their future plans, and make an educated decision. 

Always keep some cash at the ready. When one of my investments dips below my average entry point, I usually buy down my average by doubling my holdings. That way you get back in the green quicker when it goes back up. A good investment with always go back up. You just have to be patient. 

If you want to truly invest, then make sure you’re investing, not gambling.

If you’re looking to be a day trader, then I would suggest educating yourself in option trading, and stick with day trading indexes like $SPY."
2021-06-10 13:25:35,stocks,*Not Financial Advice* First year investing. I turned 8 dollars into 300 in the pass few days. But this depends on how you invest. If you're investing long term. Then yes you may lose money first. Because volatility is day to day. Yesterday everyone was pushing a certain stock. Tomorrow the hype is dead in the water.
2021-06-10 14:44:07,stocks,Do you happen to have a good resource (or resources) that go into how to perform the hard numbers analysis? I've been thinking about automating some scripts to do that.

2021-06-10 13:52:35,stocks,what's your strategy?
2021-06-10 15:29:48,stocks,"I would not bother trying to write a script. You have to analyze each stock and compare it to its overall sector, sub sector, industry, and direct competitors along with the current rotation cycle of the current market. It’s a headache. Just learn what a few general good signs are in a company and then use that as a starting place. Look up the GenZInvestor and dividend growth investing on yt. That’s where I started and I still watch their videos."
2021-06-10 14:37:42,stocks,"Depends on the type of stocks you’re wanting to buy. 

Pure hype? Check Reddit and social media (be prepared to get burned if this is you tho) 

Value? Look up dividend aristocrats and start there. 

Growth? Honestly idk, I’m not much of a growth investor aside from a few companies I know from my personal life which allowed me to apply the investing strategy of “well I like this product and it’s hard for me to get so they must be doing decent sells, let me read more up on them”

Disclosure: I started investing the end of January 2021, and I’m up over $500  combined between my new Roth IRA and my RobinHood account ($400 up in the growth focused RH account and $100+ up in the Roth IRA not counting dividends)

Honestly YouTube is a huge help. Look up the genZinvestor on YouTube for a good sample platter of value and growth stocks."
2021-06-10 14:05:09,stocks,This is absolutely NOT the same thing. Buying indexes consisting of the nearly all the stocks in the world is not like GME.

2021-06-10 14:27:49,stocks,"I answered it on another comment but basically, index funds are a passive investment strategy that seeks to replicate an index (let's say the S&P 500 or the FTSE All world index) through a fund. There is no active management involved - stocks are added or cut based on their market cap weights and the factors that go into the index.

If you're a US citizen you can honestly just buy VT. You can also hold a bond fund, but that depends on your age and risk tolerance. If you're ex-US, like me, you should probably buy ireland domiciled ETFs for tax reasons (the bogleheads have resources on their site about this)

VT is an etf, which means exchange traded fund. You buy shares as if it were a stock - when you buy a share, you're buying a proportional amount of the 9000+ companies included in the fund. The idea is to capture market beta, without trying to capture excess risk adjusted returns (alpha) by buying individual stocks as that has a distinct probability of backfiring horribly for most investors."

As far as the other growth stocks it sounds like you’re going to have to ask yourself why you are holding them, why did you buy them in the first place, and what you actually expect to happen with them. You can also look up the ticker symbol and “stock forecast” on Google and get a CNBC forecast estimate of what “experts” think the price will be in a year. It might be that or might not though."

Boring action means that it gets destroyed. It's not like...just as a hypothetical...the VIX is at 100 with SPY at 300 and it goes down from there as SPY goes up...I mean, the darned VIX was higher than the level it was in August at the lowest after that stock rout in the second week of May with SPY I don't know...nearly 20% above that?"

For example, if the market is buying up long dated vol (say 6m puts) and selling short dated (like a 30d put) to express their view that market is going to have a bit of trouble in 2H of the year, vix would compress even though longer dated IV increases.

Technology wise, Google Stadia looks amazing... in practice, who actually uses it? (that was rhetorical btw, I'm sure some in here do use it, but it will never catch up with the market) 

Bandwidth and latency are the biggest issues, that's not about to change anytime soon. 

The public wants impressive graphics. As bandwidth increases, and servers become more spread out to reduce latency, the standard for visuals also increases, so cloud gaming will, for the foreseeable future, be playing catchup.

It's fine if you want to play games where this isn't such a problem, like single players and RPGs, but try playing anything competitive that needs low ping, like an FPS, with extra hops on the network. You'll get ruined by other players nearly every time.

Companies have been pushing this tech for years. It never takes off, because its always behind the curve.

(Edit: phone typos)"
2021-06-10 16:10:34,stocks,The current limitation is internet speed and ping. These services never work for online games that are even semi competitive. Unless they find a way to cut down on input lag I’m not impressed.

2021-06-10 15:11:06,stocks,Google and Amazon already have something similar but it would be easier for Microsoft to transition to this space and dominate it. I can see how this would work. Gaming is only going to get bigger and the amount of casual gamers out there across the world being able to connect to each other on a multitude of devices makes a ton of sense.

If someone wants to own that lucrative market in 5-15 years they need to lay the groundwork now. The primary reason Steam still exists is first-mover advantage."

2021-06-10 17:50:02,stocks,"I predict that game passes and other subscription models will be a huge game changer in the gaming industry. Currently, the revenue is mostly created during the initial sale of a game and it can only be increased with microtransactions and DLCs. A subscription based system would generate a continuous cash flow and allows game developers to take more risk. Also, the goal would be customer retention and so better quality and a longer support would be important.     
However, the biggest problem is that every publisher might set up one and then customers have to choose between millions of subscriptions. Maybe, that's just a short-term reaction and in the future, big companies buy smaller developers to consolidate. At least, there will be an interesting development in the next few years."

2021-06-10 18:21:26,stocks,"I have yet to experience a decent version of these services, jussayin.

Stadia was maybe the only half-decent one, but the one I was really hoping for was PSNow - the lag ended up being too much for me to handle. I just don't think we have the tech or the internet infrastructure to really make these kinds of services popular."
2021-06-10 18:33:13,stocks,"I don't like that. Most PC/console games today are realtime. Even with expensive optics internet you would still feel the input lag. There's no way around that. You need at least graphical engine to be run locally, you may then run like physics engine on server but I don't see a merit in such hybrid solution. Without that, you are left with only primitive causal games, but I don't expect much interest in buying just another extra hardware to play primitive causal games. 

I won't expect this a good investment. But for non-gamers, for office workers, engineers, architects and such, this could have a use."

2021-06-10 18:10:33,stocks,This is such Boomer tier bollocks. No one with hands enjoys playing games on a 1-2 second delay. As soon as you have had a taste of playing with no latency you literally cannot go back. Games as a service is fine. And game pass is genuinely great but games as a service and streamed? Dunno if that’s the real moneymaker. It seems like for everything Microsoft do really well they’re also shooting themselves in the foot.

With even just single player games if there’s enough input lag it makes the game feel terrible. I mean, it’s possible to maybe hide lag behind rollback GGPO style but then the game will have to be designed around that, doesn’t it?

I’m skeptical until the internet infrastructure can support something like this; you can’t buffer everything the same way you do a video because of the autonomy a player has over their character. 

I mean, maybe you could if everything was linear enough. Then you could send data for all results happening within the next second and it only uses whatever you choose to do (stay still, walk forward, walk back).

I dunno, possible? But I’ll remain a skeptic for now."

I own shares of all this companies anyways but for different reasons."
2021-06-10 15:18:47,stocks,"Lol what's with all the dislikes? Do we have some Microsoft fanboys here?

Let's be real, this isn't going to work. The average consumer does not have the internet power to stream AAA games at 60 fps. This exact same idea has been tried so many times, and they all have failed. Anybody that thinks this is a good idea has clearly never tried to stream a game before. Sorry not sorry 🤷‍♂️"
2021-06-10 13:42:25,stocks,"I think megacaps like Microsoft are too limited in growth potential given the current investing environment. I honestly believe small to midcap American companies with innovation potential are going to see astronomical gains because of the combination of infrastructure spending and speculative investing. Money is going to be racing into these companies before it's too late. Companies such as Asensus Surgical (ASXC), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Meatech (MITC), UR Energy (URG), Agrify (AGFY), Vision Marine (VMAR), CNSL, CMLS, EBIX, PKE, RMTI, FSTR, Genie Energy (GNE), GHM, GIFI, LFVN, Aemetis (AMTX), ATNI, Audacy (AUD) and BBGI could likely fly over the next few years."

2021-06-10 16:27:11,stocks,"Every streaming service for video games has failed massively due to input lag. I don't know how they realistically overcome this issue. Most modern games are unplayable when you have to wait even a few milliseconds for an input response.

2021-06-10 16:57:30,stocks,"Pushing this now is a terrible idea to be honest. 

If cloud gaming takes off big time then combined with Netflix etc peak hours internet traffic will get disgusting. 

Of course it will still function but it will do so by reducing quality on streaming services and providing a sub par experience potentially subject to bad ping and lag at its busiest. 

When most the world is running on highly contended low bandwidth connections doing it now sounds like a recipe for disaster if it takes off. 

Stock wise I'd expect similar trends to stadia. Sub par experience and terrible uptake with a high drop off resulting in poor results for the service at earnings. 

The principal is sound but most the world's infrastructure is simply not ready for this. It's not like you can just let your competitive shooter buffer for 5 minutes. 

Of course I could also be wrong."

I Actually prefer the Stadia business model. I have 86 games I have gotten for free by subscribing, and any games I purchase are mine to play without a subscription...for free after the price of the game. Its a free console, and I don't have to pay a monthly fee if I don't want to.   


The way I play games the ""Netflix"" model doesn't make sense to me. I don't want to log on to a service to play a game that may disappear before I'm done with it.   


Regardless goodbye to your expensive boxes. I will gladly pay each of the big companies to play their exclusives. Streaming is the way I want to play moving forward, but I loathe the idea of a cable like subscription model.

Of course, a subscription service works well for guaranteeing revenue but I can't imagine it's cheap to license (good) non-first party games for their service and they'd need to be able to recoup that.

I have a gaming desktop at home. I wanted to play some PC games on my TV, so I tried NVidia GameStream and Steam Link. My client and server were using the same local network, hard-wired to the same gigabit switch, and it worked like shit. Input lag was impossible to get used to. Even non-twitchy games felt very uncomfortable and difficult to play. If input lag was unacceptably high even when streaming from a server in the same LAN in the same room, how can input lag when streaming from a remote server ever get to a usable state?

Then one day I randomly decided to try out NVidia GeforceNow's free trial. I had no expectations considering NVidia's GameStream did not work well for me, but GeforceNow somehow worked so much better. I played twitchy games like Counter-Strike ranked and did well. There were times that I forgot I was even streaming games. It felt almost exactly like playing local. If there was lag, it was imperceptible to me, an avid FPS and Starcraft (diamond) player.

So, not sure what I did wrong with using GameStream/SteamLink and its obvious that game streaming still has a long way to go, but it's pretty clear to me that game streaming has improved much more compared to what it was during the days of OnLive."

Not to mention the Net Operating Losses of 1.7 Billion that a buyer, WBA, AMZN, WMT etc, would be able to write off income. Thats $36-$54 a share.  Buyout is likely.  Making money is happening now and with only 55 million shares, 1% NEt profit would be $5 a share.  STAY RAD"

2021-06-10 17:47:54,stocks,"Walgreens didn't DECIDE to only purchase half. The DOJ blocked the merger/acquisition to prevent a monopoly. The only ones who could buy out RAD would be WBA and CVS. If the DOJ already blocked WBA from the merger, why would they allow CVS (the largest retailer) to complete the merger? As you said RAD is the 3rd largest pharmacy chain, so they're too big to be bought out/acquired.

RAD, WBA, CVS all have the same problem: they make money on their pharmacy side, but the store side (selling water/snacks/alcohol/ice cream) do not make enough profits to justify the labor/cost of goods sold/ cost of lease space.

Online pharmacy, whether it's from AMZN or any other up and coming pharmacy is going to be a major disruptor in the coming years. I'm not saying we're not going to have physical pharmacy stores, simply that we will need a lot less of them."

2021-06-10 15:28:08,stocks,"If you are suggesting that Rite Aid is going bankrupt then you are clearly not following the company.

The financial health of Rite Aid has improved to such a significant extent that Moody’s just upgraded the rating on RAD from stable to positive last month.

Last year Rite Aid has positive free cash flow and more that $400 million in EBITDA, to go along with $24 billion in revenue.  Earlier this year the company completed a $95 million acquisition of Bartell Drugs.  In addition, the company is investing about $200 million in store remodeling, which is improving results at each of the refurbished locations by about 3%.

The $3.1 billion in long term debt is being easily serviced by the company, and they’ve been paying down chunks of debt early from time to time.

This year, Rite Aid will turn the corner and have positive net earnings overall.

So if you are thinking that Rite Aid is heading for potential bankruptcy, perhaps you should turn the page on the calendar and join us in the year 2021."

At current valuation, this would be a perfect acquisition target by a bigger company.

Any good CEO/CFO would have simple solutions to tackle this, (restructuring debt, cost-efficient initiatives, renegotiating with suppliers, etc.). Rite Aid management is already undertaking some of these initiatives, in fact, they have restructured some of their high interest debt which wasn’t due until 2023 coupe of months ago.

2021-06-10 15:33:13,stocks,"The amount of debt is of no concern.  With $24 billion in annual revenue, Rite Aid is easily able to completely service the $3.1 billion in long-term debt and still invest $200+ million each year remodeling locations to the new “store of the future” concept.  And on top of that, RAD was able to complete a $95 million acquisition of Bartell Drugs earlier this year.

Even with the interest payments on the debt, RAD will have net positive earnings this year.

2021-06-10 12:26:32,stocks,"I think a greatly undervalued stock is Rite Aid. Since the sale to Walgreens fell through (Walgreens decided to only purchase half of Rite Aid stores), the stocks taken a beating. 

Since then, Rite Aid has brought in a new CEO and changed up their management team. They've implemented a new strategy to modernize the store layout, focus on growing their PBM, acquired Bartell (Seattle's largest pharmacy) and creating a better experience for customers. 

Rite Aid is the 3rd largest pharmacy chain in the US (behind Walgreens and CVS). In FY21 they've done $24B+ in Revenue. The issue is that they have not turned a profit. There's 2 outcomes: Rite Aid's turnaround plan implemented by the new management team is successful and Rite Aid becomes profitable resulting in significant rise in share price or Rite Aid gets acquired.

2021-06-10 14:35:58,stocks,"Eh. I took a look at LMND a month or so ago. The main difference between them and traditional insurance is they automate much of their client facing operations, and they use AI to manage a lot of internal processes. However, they spend a huge amount on marketing, they are competing with other giants whose business model is not showing any sign of faltering or losing market share as far as I can tell. They are basically betting that they can get the young milennial/Gen Z crowd before the traditional insurers get to them, and hold on to them as they become more mature and richer and have more property to ensure. I'm not sure their way of doing things will ultimately translate into lower premiums or better coverage than their competitors in the long run, so, as those customers get older and richer, they are going to stop giving a shit about flashy apps and marketing and just look at raw dollars and sense. In other words, they can grow only as long as the pie keeps getting bigger, but at a certain point the traditionals are going to start eating the new slices.

I'm not saying it's a bad play depending on how long you want to hold it for. But in my view there is limited upside and big downside in the long term."

2021-06-10 10:57:26,stocks,Typically the company being acquired benefits most from the acquisition as the acquiring company will typically pay a premium above the current stock price to acquire.

2021-06-10 11:32:27,stocks,That actually makes you less likely to be acquired (unless you know for sure that the company is looking to be bought).   Who wants to buy a large slow moving target when you can just pick off their customers.   Normally that is a sign that your company will look to acquire a smaller company with the tech you need that can be integrated.

I guess the question is, why is the company being acquired, and is it going to be acquired for a premium or for pennies on the dollar? If the company is being acquired because of its growth, then it’ll likely be bought for a premium. If it’s going to be bought for something like it’s patent library or some of its parts, the deal may not be as favorable for the acquired company."

There is a lot of confusion about how the payout will go for existing shareholders, so I'd stay away from it for now. But once it comes out of bankruptcy and all that is settled, isn't it an incredibly attractive reopening play? Cost of used cars is at an all time high, people are coming out in droves, rental cars in extremely high demand... and its closest competitor AVIS is trading at 88.52"

2021-06-10 09:27:04,stocks,You don't think all of that will be priced in?  The idea behind most reopening plays is that the stocks were overly beaten up and should recover.  When determining if a stock is a good buy you have to consider price vs valuation.  There is no way to speculate if something is going to be a good buy when you do not know what the price is going to be and where that is going to valuate the company.
2021-06-10 09:44:53,stocks,"There is a lot more to determining whether a company will be profitable than demand for its services.

Also look at other companies that provide the same services, are they doing more business than they can handle, or are they struggling as well?  No one needs another car rental business when theres barely enough to keep the others afloat. Bankruptcy will also impact their image, and given all the options, would  people choose them over another, given all options are the same? Its just some things to think about."

> The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.6 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 0.8 percent in April, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 5.0 percent before seasonal adjustment; this was the largest 12-month increase since a 5.4-percent increase for the period ending August 2008. 

> The index for used cars and trucks continued to rise sharply, increasing 7.3 percent in May. This increase accounted for about one-third of the seasonally adjusted all items increase. The food index increased 0.4 percent in May, the same increase as in April. The energy index was unchanged in May, with a decline in the gasoline index again offsetting increases in the electricity and natural gas indexes. 

> The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.7 percent in May after increasing 0.9 percent in April. Many of the same indexes continued to increase, including used cars and trucks, household furnishings and operations, new vehicles, airline fares, and apparel. The index for medical care fell slightly, one of the few major component indexes to decline in May. 

> The all items index rose 5.0 percent for the 12 months ending May; it has been trending up every month since January, when the 12-month change was 1.4 percent. The index for all items less food and energy rose 3.8 percent over the last 12-months, the largest 12-month increase since the period ending June 1992. The energy index rose 28.5 percent over the last 12-months, and the food index increased 2.2 percent.

2021-06-10 10:33:01,stocks,One thing that's interesting to me is that if Hertz hadn't gone bankrupt it would be sitting so pretty right now with these used car prices.
2021-06-10 09:00:52,stocks,"TL;DR: Inflation rose 5% YoY for May beating the 4.7% estimate. Just like last month, one third of the inflation is traced to used cars as they rose 7.3% in May. On a month on month basis, inflation rose 0.6% for all urban consumers, lower than the 0.8% we saw in April. Index for all items less food and energy rose 0.7% in May, lower than the 0.9% we saw in April. 

It would appear that overall inflation growth is slowing down and the reason for it beating estimates is because of used car pricing."

inflation is still running a bit hot, but a lot of that is due to cars, airfare & lodging. it's also decelerating M/M. if we see a print > 0.6% next month then ill be worried again"

It's not a bubble, there are supply chain issues and high demand due to all of the fiscal stimulus and expansionary monetary policy.

i believe its saying it rose 0.7% month over month. from April to May.

only thing that remained unchanged month over month is the energy sector inflation. and decrease in gasoline index.

Retail traders drove shares of Geo Group Inc. up as much as 73%, even as the company struggles for survival in a world turning on private-prison operators. As of the close, Geo surged a record 38%.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration plans to sever ties with the industry, and lenders including Bank of America Corp. have pledged to no longer finance prisons. When S&P Global Ratings downgraded its assessment of Geo’s creditworthiness in March, it noted that prison operators face “ongoing social and governance risks.” A proposed Alabama bond sale for a private-prison firm was derailed earlier this year by opposition from activist groups.

BB is still years away from real good consistent revenue. They’re a company that has completely changed and has made some good strategic partnerships but as far as a meaningful product they’re a 5 year play minimum. 

I think real value of the stock today is single digits.

Most people joined this year with all the ''short squeeze'' and ''hedge fund evil bastards, everything is their fault'' going around everywhere, and on top of that there are millions of them, if not tens of millions, on top of that i can't see why institutions wouldn't take advantage of pumps and dumps. And what they get is them being ''right'' and meme stocks actually going up with all the money flowing into it.

So meme madness is all they known markets to be about, its their norm, its what they think markets are all about. 

We see many of them learning their first lesson ''i was up so many %, why didn't i take profit and trusted all the diamond hands and got greedy''

Hilariously reminds me of sentiment in 2000s where everyone and their mothers invested in ton of garbage and overvalued everything that exists, when reality came down on them, they also screeched the same ''its all rigged, dirty ass billionaires taking all of our money''

People never change."

Also price changes are almost never driven by the masses. When you see a stock (except low float and Penny stocks) moving it's because institutions are buying or selling. Retail is barely a blip on price charts.

2021-06-10 17:59:25,stocks,"Sprt has a merger on the way with Greenidge, one of the biggest B tc mining companies with the cheapest owned energy infrastructure. Current short interest is 45% if not higher on a low float 7M. Estimated undervalue of 50% when it was 4.98 so 7.61 is more fair value. Stock will be $60 after merger at 7.61.

This link explains that a little better: https://investorplace.com/2021/04/expect-sprt-stock-jump-from-its-merger/

OTRK, 36% short interest, 7M float. Shorted to the ground off of news they lost, Aetna, their biggest customer (they’re a healthcare company) which seems unjustified. Their new CEO is the former CVS CEO/Aetna marketing exec, which could lead to a possible CVS contract or Aetna repairment in the future as well as Amazon released news yesterday they’ve signed contracts with some healthcare providers recently so fingers crossed they get a contract to assist with the rally. They have an overleveraged short seller who cannot possibly cover the float cause there aren’t enough shares left. Gap up of 39-55 meaning it will be very easy to go up. Likely short selling average is $45 so expect to see large spikes as the price gets closer as they cover small portions hoping people will sell before they can cover all of it.

Disclaimer: I’m a mod of the OTRK sub, created 2 days ago so it’s still fresh  and I bought SPRT yesterday. I’m just here to make money, no BS. So if you have any further questions, go ahead."

If people can band together on this, great things could happen for both the little guy and the company at large. It’s a win/win in my opinion."

how has that been working out for you ? Price was barely going up over $300, even more laughable it was nowhere close to January's $483,00

GME yesterdays news was weakest part of it, it cast a lot of doubt on their actual success because they were not presenting anything that market would want to see.

Fanboys of course were telling that GME could compete with steam by end of the day, which doesn't make any sense if you been following how other Stream competition is doing.

Then they were lavishing about Gamestop customers being loyal, which is just absolute delusions, because Gamestop used to have applications for gaming downloads and products, and they discontinued it and customers lost all of their monetary value in it. Customers are not only not loyal to Gamestop, they been scammed by Gamestop before it was having a turn around, that thing just doesn't go away.

Then talking about Gamestop loyalty, people acting like before corona they were going to Gamestop every day with all their friends and family and everyone they know, pretty laughable, they do know the company was going bankrupt for a good reason right ?

NFT is just a cesspool, doesn't seem there is anyway they come out of top.

Then people argue Gamestop will open gaming cafe or somehow have their way into esports. Have they seen the size of Gamestops shops ? They are all really small.

Seriously investopedia.

Its not as fucking conspiratory and cryptic as you all make it out to be. And there is no fucking way any of this anyhow causes mother of all short squeezes.

In January they were balls deep 140%, and stock price doubled at least 4 times and then raised some more, which meant all the shorts were under water. It also all happened in very  short time frame.

What has been happening past month is that its been pumping and dumping completely normaly. Probably due to 10 mil potential investors plus institutions jumping in with their mil of share buys. No rapid increases, no halts, no shorts being squeezed, no anything. Peaked around 300$ and price started shaking legs. Yall so blindly chasing, which is not bad on itself, but somehow linking it to MOASS which is just not happening anymore, ever. Best you can hope is a really nice pump. And all the shorts that are left can possibly be at very high positions, nothing even close to January's situation.

What is hilarious that people that so vividly used to hate CNBC with passion and hate SEC with passion are now listening to some Israeli lawyer talk about todays stocks with such certainty though he can't verify shit at the moment on top of saying multiple times ''we really don't know''.

I could make plenty of failure to deviler myself that will show up in statistics. Money isn't magically disappearing or appearing.

Honestly the links explain very well... what happened in January 

Link from the first post summarises it all very well [https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf)

Since in January short sellers did lose 70 bils, they actually did every trick in the book and got bail outs for crap they were in. And then of course the infamous restriction of buying around 50 volatile stocks GME included.

As the sec link explains all the manipulation is done so the manipulators can finish the short at favorable price. And yall are forgeting that February had that price drop back to 40$ that lasted for like almost 20 days, giving all of the dirty Hedge funds time to get their shit together.

And afterward short % obviously dropped, failure to deliver obviously dropped, GME saga was over and it was quite an epic and bitter end.

But we have 10 mil if not more new comers, how many of them lost money, how many of them are holding the bags ? What else they will do, GME and AMC and NOK is the only things they knew.

The biggest holes start afterward, the so called ''GME squeeze is not over'', obviously everyone who could read went through it all, and its undeniably over.

And then we have your first reddit link from user broccaaa. Random kid whos reddit activity showed up around end of January like most of you, yelling stuff like ''shut the fuck up hedge fund shill'' or ''all media is bullshit''. And would you look at that, he made **artifical intelligence** that suddenly found 140mil FTD that you guys so desperately needed. 

After that it turns to whole circus. Why is there an account that was previously with 0 activity ? Well either he knows he is actually engaging with market manipulation with his posts. Or he is actually new to stock market and is desperately trying to pump his bags. I have seen more effort than that, seen entire web sites and journalism networks being made last year so the bags can be pumped on r/pennystocks

augrr and plants69 accounts also show absolutely 0 prior interest in stocks before January. if i had to guess its blind leading the blind. I remember plenty superstonkers tried to convince r/stocks that all of their information is coming from veteran investors from wallstreetbets etc. interestingly doesn't look like you guys have a single veteran there, something to note for sure.

Notably also avoiding wallstreetbets for some reason. Its not the first time wallstreetbets would be hit with huge disertations of information, the original members under 2 mil there are quite a lot of people that could dig through all of it. We had memes about it

Just my two cents but honestly Walmart and Target serve a very different customer base.

(IMO but I don't think I'm alone)

Target has the suburban wife/mom/family on lock down, especially here in the Midwest.  People will drive further to go to Target over Walmart.

2021-06-10 13:50:43,stocks,"Confused about doing a poor man's covered call...

I have some SHOP that's currently trading at around $1228 today and I think I'm [following the instructions to a T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C1PiUOgiYk) by finding and buying a deep in-the-money call about roughly two months out with a delta of \~0.95 and selling an out of money call a couple of weeks out. 

But the problem is the price of the buy call option with a 0.95 delta is ridiculously high ($273) that no out of money sell price will break even (for my example, I put 1270, which is selling at $11. So in the end, the spread price comes out to -$262. Here's a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/kuv3Zha) of what I did. I thought the thinking behind the poor man's covered call was that you make less than if you sold a covered call but you don't quite have 100 shares. 

What am I doing wrong? Am I even doing something wrong?"

It seems like people are pretty confident that the Fed knows what it's doing these days, especially in regards to ultra-easy monetary policy and inflation.  How about this:

\[During the crisis,\] ""the Federal Reserve realized far too late the systemic danger inherent in the interconnections of the unregulated over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives marketand did not have the information needed to act.""

I think it's totally inappropriate to blindly trust the Fed, especially given their history of making huge mistakes.  They may be right, of course, and everything may be fine.  But they don't *have* to be right.  Nobody has a crystal ball.

2021-06-10 10:36:42,stocks,"I guess I don’t quite understand how writing PUTs works. Writing a covered CALL makes sense. The buyer can opt to purchase your shares if the CALL expires In the money (ITM). But writing a covered PUT makes so much less sense to my dyslexic brain.

Can anyone care to explain?

And why are naked CALLs and PUTs even legal?

Edit:
Me trying to make sense of this…

So to write a covered PUT one must first borrow 100 shares of a stock and then sell them. I think the stock market would benefit greatly if we made that illegal. Then you write a PUT against those shorted shares. That PUT then defines a strike price that you must pay to buy back those shares, so you can return them to the holder who loaned them to you.

(Poof!) My mind explodes.


It would make far more sense to me if a covered PUT worked this way:
You BUY shares and sell a PUT against shares you OWN. While the PUT is open, the buyer of it basically owns those shares. If it expires in the money you must buy them back at the strike price, otherwise they return to you at no cost.

But of course, that is not how it works."

Between all the investing subs I've been in, the biggest thing I've taken away is that nobody has the magic crystal ball and you're often best off taking note of sentiment and news but otherwise not allowing outside noise to screw with your gameplan too much unless it really seems concerning. 

If anything you should just learn to have all bases covered at all times (i.e. always have exposure to the market and reasonable cash) because it's just too unpredictable. If it wants to rise it will rise. If it wants to fall, it will fall. Most attempts to draw patterns based on catalysts in the short term will just fall flat.

They saved themselves plenty of money and missed out on what, a below average day for the broader market? 

For the record I'm not into those type of stocks to begin with, but conceptually holding up a day where the inflation sensitive stocks tank, the rest of the market is broadly albeit barely positive as proof that ""timing"" doesn't work is sort of silly.

2021-06-10 08:33:48,stocks,But down to just a 0.6% monthly increase compared to 0.8% last month.  I was expecting it to be hotter than this but let's see what analysts say.
2021-06-10 08:53:42,stocks,"I actually saw them gap down but maybe it was because what I was watching to see the news live was at a commercial. 

It wasn’t as extreme as May 12th but you sorta saw the same reaction. Gap down and then bounce. We know what happened during regular trading hours on that day. Unless the Dow has enough strength to lead, I kind of think you get something similar, but less extreme than that day (more like a move that is a percent move or so)."
2021-06-10 11:02:39,stocks,"Thing is I feel like you don't even need to be needle-eyed about inflation to see why the market is so schizophrenic lately. Financial pundits like to point at it to explain the day to day action but no one knows why traders and investors do what they do from day to day. But shrugging and saying ""IDK"" doesn't make well for news and the hot button issue now is inflation. Later this month I bet it'll be all about housing and the moratorium. Fact of the matter is, though, there are a lot of reasons to be uncomfortable with the markets right now. Record high margin debt. Retail frenzy. IPO boom. Housing boom. Highest valuations since the dotcom bubble. High unemployment. Unsustainable rates and inevitable tapering. The list goes on, there's a lot of ammo for the bears out there."

Meanwhile, car makers are going whole hog into EVs *now*.  They need batteries now. They don't care if those batteries are futuristic, just that they are available and affordable.  For that reason I prefer the micro-vast merger.  They produce what I take to be run of the mill, nothing-too-sexy regular batteries, but that's what I think automakers probably want right now.

Main thing that's consistently worked out for me is not spreading myself too thin between a ton of crap that I know little about or can't keep up with and will question too much and just being patient. The market always presents new opportunties. Never get desperate. Another chance comes sooner or later.

Don't invest just cause people say you must or you'll forever regret it. Dont' invest just the market's constantly rallying. Don't invest just you see a big discount on a stock.

Of all the bev companies, Molson Coors has been working hardest on new products and ideas.

Catalysts include:

1. Expansion/reinvention of Yuengling and Coors Banquet legacy brands
2. Replenishment of Coors Light kegs as bars/restaurants re-open in large markets such as CA/NV/PNW/Europe
3. Expansion of seltzers, specifically Vizzy, Coors Hard new flavors (like Creamsicle), and **Topo Chico. Topo Chico** has achieved >25% market share in Texas one month after launch.
4. Expansion of energy drinks, specifically the Rock's ZOA drink
5. Expansion of CBD/THC drinks, specifically Truss, as more locales legalize

2021-06-10 10:40:14,stocks,"Selling calls can force you to sell stock for less than it’s worth, selling puts can force you to buy stock for more than it’s worth."
2021-06-10 11:04:55,stocks,"In a covered call, you have a long position in the underlying stock, and you write a call against your stock position. This gives you an upfront premium, but the trade-off is that your gains on the stock are capped if the price of the stock moves up past the strike price of the call.

A covered put is the reverse of this. You have a short position in the underlying stock, and you write a put against your short position. Again, this gives you an upfront premium. But again, there's a trade-off. Without the put, you would be very happy for the stock to plummet in price, due to your short position. By writing the put, you're obligated to buy the stock if it drops below the put's strike price, which closes out or offsets your short position, so you don't benefit from the price dropping below the strike price.

Note that in a covered put, you have a short position in the underlying stock, not a long position, in case that's what was causing confusion. If you have a long position and you write a put, the put isn't covered because if the put is exercised, you're obligated to buy the stock, and you don't have a corresponding short position to offset it. That's what the ""covered"" part of covered call or covered put means - if the option is exercised, you don't have exposure to movements in the underlying price because you're already covered with an offsetting position.

Regarding the question of legality of naked calls and puts: it's not really consistent with the principles of our financial system to make them illegal. Basically, for financial instruments, if you can find a buyer, you can sell it, and vice versa. There are regulations in place to mitigate the risk of naked option positions. For example, brokers by regulation will require a lot more margin for naked options than covered options. You can certainly argue that regulation could go further in mitigating systemic risk though. Brokers further manage risk through their own measures, for example not allowing retail traders to open 0DTE naked option positions."

2021-06-10 17:31:05,stocks,i think they’re a little overweight personally.. plus with 10y not budging despite the CPI today i feel like i’m going to miss the opportunity in other areas if i buy into financials now waiting for inflation to finally hit
2021-06-10 18:58:40,stocks,">xlf

If you look at a 2 year chart, or even a 6 month chart you'll see it's not down ""a lot"" -- it's actually barely down at all."
2021-06-10 09:51:00,stocks,"Irrelevant, only thing investors care about if the inflation is indeed transitionary not increasing.

Now we can start considering this bad bump in the road and start thinking that tech is back on menu"
2021-06-10 15:05:55,stocks,Same situation. Been in since August 2020 at a cost basis of $127. Held through what feels like endless rounds of up and downs and sideways action since then. Dipped all the way down to 106 after I bought. I held. Spiked up to 144. I held. Then has been between 124-132 ever since. Still holding. Fun times!!
2021-06-10 14:12:19,stocks,It's so funny suffering the opportunity cost of sitting in Apple. You've basically been putting that $ in a savings account the last 8 months while EVs / hype stocks have doubled up. God forbid we go through a broad market correction and Apple drops down to 90. Limited upside with plenty of downside.
2021-06-10 10:41:31,stocks,They’re saving the money so they can load up on Robinhood lmao
2021-06-10 10:01:51,stocks,I don't know what their holdings are right now but there was a time where I checked out that ETF and thought it had solid holdings.

2021-06-10 08:38:18,stocks,"Geez I didn't even vote for Biden but can't make it too far without having one of these guys jump out.

Even if there is mass inflation it's not necessarily Biden's fault, lol.  Plus the 5% number is compared to significant *deflation* 12 months ago at the height of the pandemic.  The monthly increase was actually lower this time.

And all this coming from a guy who's betting on inflation."
2021-06-10 08:41:46,stocks,If his tax hike and spending bill will be trimmed significantly hopefully inflation will be transitionary. Some damage is still being done though due to artificial wage hike from all the neverending pandemic assistance. He also restricted some fracking so oil price is inflated.
2021-06-10 14:18:11,stocks,What do you own?
2021-06-10 09:52:28,stocks,Anyone know how to put this guy on ignore?
2021-06-10 09:52:26,stocks,"Don’t stocks usually go up due to inflation?  If the cost of living goes up, so does the market as well."
2021-06-10 10:55:53,stocks,No that money has been made.
2021-06-10 10:54:25,stocks,I’ve been looking at some and I think there is still room to grow but the market has definitely priced in some of the opening already

2021-06-10 13:10:33,stocks,"If you plan to hold until you retire why do you even care? It will be up 5$ tomorrow, down 5 on monday, then up 10 and so on.
Leave it where it is and don't bother a financial advisor for 200 bucks lol"
2021-06-10 13:16:26,stocks,"You really need to do more research before playing with stocks. You’re talking about a dip of less than 2% today (at the current present time), which is not fun but negligible in a vacuum.

No matter what stock you invest in, you’ll experience short term fluctuations in either direction. In the long run, the securities you’re invested in should trade around its present inherent value. Your job is to do the best you can to identify what you believe a stock’s present day value is and invest in securities that the market is currently undervaluing. It’s not easy, but there are a lot of resources you can dive into to learn.

Also if you go on YouTube, just be weary about all the hype stocks that are commonly pumped. I’m not saying they’re universally bad by definition, but most of them are overvalued and will underperform imo."

2021-06-10 09:29:36,stocks,"what broker are you using? There is a dividend tax that automatically comes out of the dividends from some of my EU brokers, apparently it's the US taxing us for whatever reason.

As for income tax, you have to check with our local laws."
2021-06-10 09:53:14,stocks,"You have to sign and send to your broker this form:  
""Form W8-BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for U.S. Tax Withholding, is used by a foreign person to establish both foreign status and beneficial ownership, and to claim income tax treaty benefits with respect to income other than compensation for personal services.""  
This is the way you avoid double taxation, U.S. taxes. Then you have to deal only with the taxes of your country which varies from zero to a high percentage of your annual gain (in any case you have to report them)."
2021-06-10 10:49:52,stocks,"I think it's a good long-term hold. I almost bought it back when it was around $2 and I'm disappointed that I didn't

2021-06-10 11:06:15,stocks,"That's just like...your opinion, but this is not the reason why the Russell is behaving terribly today.

It's behaving terribly because cyclicals as a whole are behaving terribly and the Russell has oil and bank stocks along with some small cap tech. That's your reason."
2021-06-10 15:57:50,stocks,They also claim that pizza places with no basements have basements filled with children. Are there any reputable sources for this?
2021-06-10 16:09:46,stocks,Your first mistake is listening to people on /pol about anything. Unless you enjoy getting fresh OC disinfo instead of waiting for it to trickle across the internet.

It hit the target dead on. I think inflation might settle for 2.5-ish% a year for a bit, just like the FED wants.

You're right though - september-october numbers should be a solid tell."
2021-06-10 09:57:18,stocks,"Spot on on each point. I've found myself blocking out the noise a lot more lately and just gauging sentiment rather than planning or changing plans based on it. 

Like you, every time I'd try to hyper-focus on a perfect entry point or try to time a dip or something along those lines, I got absolutely wrecked. So I've mostly just been adding to positions of companies I'm high on and averaging in regardless of what the market's been doing and I've been much more successful in doing so."

2021-06-10 10:24:28,stocks,Absolutely.  Nobody wants to talk RR's because they're boring and not sexy but they're great stocks to own honestly and are still growth/value companies.  I myself need to do further DD because I want to consolidate into one rather than being in 2/3 of them

Barring these two theories of mine tho i have no clue."

Bears can talk about valuations all day but most of these companies deserve them, in fact a lot of stocks are looking extremely cheap especially Chinese stocks due to the fact that US nationalists are trying to push for removing our rights to invest in what we want, how ironic for the US to try and fight CoMmuNisM by taking away people’s rights and potentially screwing over investors, when in fact taking away those fundamental RIGHTS will do nothing to hurt China and will only hurt the investors. Good thing it will never come to be, the US would prove itself to be worse than China if they ever delisted companies. You don’t see China being petty like the US it kind of makes me embarrassed of our government for how insecure the US is acting"

2021-06-10 19:36:22,stocks,So in the current situation with AMC and BB for example buying a $13 PUT on BB is pretty much just like throwing your money in the garbage because the you’re paying such a high premium for a stock that won’t reach that strike price/ breakeven??

2021-06-10 16:29:54,stocks,I’m hesitant if I should keep averaging my cost down if they just keep dipping everyday. Of course no one knows where it will bottom out and rebound. Still sad to see some good gains being wiped away.

2021-06-10 11:14:01,stocks,Wrong. Every move down is a ladder attack and every move up is a pump and dump because all hedge funds are run exactly like Stratton Oakmont /s
2021-06-10 12:09:51,stocks,"This. 

Most trading is in fact fund managers, which is exactly why funds, on average, dont beat the S&P after accounting for fees—for every fund that does well one does badly. Funds frankly dont give a shit about retail. Their business model is competing against other funds for the pool of investors (bigger pool of managed money = more fees = more fund profit). In other words, it doesn’t matter if funds beat retail; it matters if they beat other funds."
2021-06-10 10:43:12,stocks,"That’s the simple part. Try explaining naked versus covered PUT. 

Selling short doesn’t make much sense either. And that’s part of a covered PUT."

Hedge funds would hate such a change. But wouldn’t retail investors love it?"
2021-06-10 12:01:09,stocks,Apparently I am not the only person who is confused. To call it a covered put you *must* own a short position in that stock. Sure you can write a PUT without doing so. That is a naked PUT.
2021-06-10 10:47:24,stocks,"Not concerned, just being bitter. I don’t really worry about down days anymore. I’m finally up all time so it’s chill. The tumble is beginning though across the board."

2021-06-10 14:03:32,stocks,Which is why one would be hesitant to jump in all at once right now.
2021-06-10 13:28:38,stocks,Thanks!

If you check the oil price today it's actually the price for delivery in a month, cost per barrel, at a specified place. If I'm a farmer and I see oil's cheap in January 2021, I place an order for delivery for X thousand gallons of diesel for delivery in March 2021 when it's needed. The money goes out, the price of oil increases a tiny bit, and the farmer picks it up in March with her truck for delivery.

Ramp this up to every part of the economy and it's reflected in the price of oil, as production has been slowly increasing. It's macroeconomically reflective while subject to speculation, geopolitics, and the power of OPEC+."

There’s a reason why banks have low valuations and a reason growth warrants having higher ones.

2021-06-10 12:58:17,stocks,"Some of the share price ups and downs over the last year have been a result of various happenings. Here's some background of those.

FSLY has best of breed technology. When pandemic started, they had instant, perfect solutions for the sudden surge in demand.  Along the same timeline, one of their customers, Tiktok, exploded in popularity and usage.  

Then there was a Trump campaign rally in which Tiktok users banded together to request tickets, creating a fake impression that hundreds of thousands of MAGAs were coming, but the true demand was only a few thousand, leaving empty grandstands.  Embarrassed, Trump waged war on Tiktok, threatening to ban it if they didn't sell the company to American interests, ultimately those being family of the Walmart fortune.  

As tiktok's primary supplier, Fastly was seen as potentially taking a hit from such a ban.  Would they lose some of Tiktok's business?  And for how long?

While his ban threat was playing out, tiktok's Chinese owners found a way to copy or replace the web serving functions of Fastly.  In a surprising quarterly announcement, Fastly revealed that they had lost 100% of the business of their largest customer, TikTok, and that loss would be permanent.  It was the worst case scenario.  Trump's weird personal vendetta had only resulted in harm to an American company, Fastly, and actually benefitted Tiktok.  

Fastly would go on to reveal high demand from other customers that might make up for the loss of Tiktok.  And they also announced some of the most advanced technology in the CDN industry.  

One knock against FSLY had been regarding security, but Fastly acquired and integrated a security company which handled that objection and gave them additional revenue streams.  

Fastly has been revealed to have a low customer count, but the customers they do have are major entities who rely on them heavily.  There have been rumors that some tech megacap might like to buy them.  

Since their fortunes did rise with the work/study from home trend, there's some assumption their business could revert as the pandemic retreats.  Their high multiple also made them vulnerable to rising interest rate corrections."

I am personally interested in the tech industry so that's where I invested most of my money. But I realized that my portfolio is not diverse as I'd like it to be so I was hoping to get some suggestions from y'all on how to diversify it or just how to improve my portfolio in general. Most of my money are in ETFs because I'm not confident enough about my knowledge to invest in individual stocks yet and I'm hoping this post will change that. I saw a similar post here today and it received really helpful feedback so I'm hoping to get some help too. These are my positions (total worth 5k):

1. VOO (31.5% of portfolio, +1.79%)
2. ARKK (28.5%, +6.34%)
3. VGT (22.42%, +4.15%)
4. MSFT (5.13%, +2.26%)
5. AMD (5.02%, -1.33%)
6. TDOC (3.16%, -1.92%)

2021-06-10 10:36:52,stocks,"extremely high concentration in the tech sector. the problem is that anything that has a strong run *this* year, is likely to under-perform in the *next few years*. in finance, they call it 'return chasing' -- everyone running after the hot thing that's gone up like a rocket. 

research shows that return chasing is counter-productive, because when something is hot it's usually overvalued, and people tend to buy at the top just before it flatlines or drops ... then they get disappointed and pull money out when it cools off. long-term, everything reverts to the average in the market. if anything, you want to put LESS money in the hot sectors, and MORE money in the things people are avoiding, in anticipation of a comeback for the dull/boring options. this is more likely to be a successful strategy.

might want to add more small and mid cap exposure. VOO is about 85% large companies, with the rest in a bit of mid cap but zero small cap exposure. but small and mid size companies (as a group) tend to outperform everything else over time. 

also you have limited international holdings. you want some exposure to overseas stocks, for a lot of reasons. 

so for you? I'd recommend some broad international exposure, and perhaps something with a value-investing tilt for the mid/small exposure. with value investing, the focus is on avoiding trendy/overvalued assets and buying only that which is fairly valued or undervalued ... this often means sticking with dull/boring/overlooked stocks when something else is getting all the attention.

* The watch will feature a display with two cameras that can be detached from the wrist in order to take pictures and videos (easing quick sharing to the platforms, including Instagram), according to the report.  

* As with smartphones, a front-facing camera is there to enable video calling, while a 1080p autofocus camera on the back can be used while detached.  

* It also features a heart rate monitor that will allow for positioning as a fitness device.   
Notably, Facebook is working with U.S. wireless carriers to support LTE connectivity, meaning the watch would not need to be paired with a phone to operate.

These are meme stocks, not long term investments. I’ve made triple digit percent gains on almost all those trades. 

I stay away from AMC and BB though, they ran too high for my liking."
2021-06-10 06:55:11,stocks,"First - short interest. It doesn't matter if it's gonna ""squeeze"" or not, if the shorts cover or anything else. You play the market not the ""fundamentals"" and the market is full of dumb apes that think ""short interest = moon"" (maybe they think it means how long they have to be interested in the stock, dunno).

Second - meme potential. If there is any catalyst to it, it has potential. I bought into CLF yesterday morning because I saw the wsb post and I saw the yt videos of the CEO berating analysts on calls and I knew there was enough ""meme potential"" behind it. Steel beams, jet fuel, chad CEO. It had all the ""meme fundamentals"".

Last - the options chain. If you really want to make money, you have to find a stock that fits the other two and has an options chain that isn't saturated yet. Call option prices SPIKE in heavy trading volume and you can see this coming to life often at market open. I was looking at deep OTM options for CLF yesterday and the volumes were already halfway to the daily regular volume minutes after market open. I bought in instantly, was 50% up within \~15 minutes and ended the day up 500% on my calls. And they are calls for july that are probably not going to strike but some poor FOMO person is still gonna buy them for a premium..

It's pretty obvious to me (keep in mind I am also a dumb person) that the options chain is the casino where people are trying to make money and the underlying is secondary to it when trading in meme stocks. Sure, you can bag a 50% profit when you buy a stock and it really moons, but the people playing leveraged games on these stocks can be taking 5000% profit in the same timeframe. All of the meme stocks have HUGE volumes on the options chain and if you find one that doesn't, that is the place to jump in. Don't play with deep OTM calls that have already gone up several thousand % for the day because that is the point where you get fucked by implied volatility and even when the price of the underlying has steady but slower gains your contract prices will likely have small growth OR they decay in value due to time/IV drop.

I do view it as gambling largely, and I am doing in with about 5% of my portfolio so the wins are nice and the losses are meh, but I have a few 3-5x trades that make the dopamine reactor in my brain go brrr and I just enjoy it."
2021-06-10 09:29:12,stocks,"It’s nice to read a post that isn’t full absolute nonsense. I’m pretty new to gambling / stocks and jumped on the band wagon with a small amount of cash (£200) a few weeks ago. Had some fun and made a little bit of pocket money on the back of a couple of meme stocks. 
That said, it stressed me out watching the numbers go up or down, the sheer volume of shills and con artists pushing whatever.. 
I’ve learned I’m not for this kind of play. I was having fun before investing in goldmines and made a little bit. Today I put my funds into an old British company - BT. The oldest communication company in the world. And this afternoon it’s already make me a cheeky fiver profit. That’ll do for me. I don’t want a Lambo or a gold plated rocket ship. I’m a simple man. 
Good luck to all of you!"

2021-06-10 09:38:36,stocks,Go to WSB. See what stocks are being spammed. See how much it has risen already. Hasn't risen too much yet? Jump in and then be prepared to sell for less then the value everyone else is giving it.

2021-06-10 15:53:45,stocks,"All this is really nothing new. It’s just value investing with a hell of a lot of fomo. 

Roaring kitty held his position for a year before it became a meme.  That’s not meme investing, its dam good dd and patience. 

A lot of meme stocks are happening purely because of what happened to GME. It’s not to say it won’t happen with another company or two. But there will be a lot more losers than winners."
2021-06-10 06:54:35,stocks,"If you are wasting your time trying to get in early on pump and dumps, take a step back, and rethink what your goal is. You may just want to the take the money and buy scratch offs if you want to gamble. Just don't promote pump and dump scams just because you bought into one yourself and stand to benefit."
2021-06-10 02:16:42,stocks,"The point of a meme stock is you can't figure it out until it happens, honestly just pick a company that has slight relevance and try and go from there, but honestly if you don't have deep market knowledge knowing when to get out of these trades is insanely difficult so in my opinion there are better strategies elsewhere."
2021-06-10 02:17:24,stocks,"I think just buying calls of stocks with high short interest might be the best bet. 

For example, I’ve been chatting with a good amount of people who think $TRIT is the next stock to explode. Unfortunately, because it’s under $1B market cap, posts are being removed on WSB.

All those who missed out on the big gains from the top meme stocks, I see a potential suitor to be the next big stock: $TRIT. The short interest is relatively high at ~24% and it looks like based on today's trades, people have already started getting in on this. Because this stock is under $1B market cap, you won't see it here on WSB but once this stock does hit $1B, look out.

Today's call volume surged, check 6/18 $7.50 and $10 calls. They're still cheap and stock price ain't bad either.

Seems like today's a start to massive accumulation. If you want that next big gain, check out $TRIT. Get in while you can while these calls are still cheap."

2021-06-10 14:38:59,stocks,I am beginning to see that we are all start to eat each other alive. Of course the hedges love it - they are now turning us against each other. I am pretty new here but have been watching things for awhile.  Seems to me that we are now getting played against each other to ensure there are no more big spikes or gamma squeezes or rides to the moon or whatever the fck you call it. The fact people are arguing against stocks while promoting their own is odd to me especially in the rooms. Seems to me that it would benefit us all if you just posted positive and negative DD - found stocks that mimic what you did at GME & AMC and focus on those - if you hold too long in these companies and the fundamentals suck - you will get eventually get burned - way of the world - just my two cents - which is all I have now haha

2021-06-10 05:19:01,stocks,Stock scanner
2021-06-10 15:08:24,stocks,"For those asking about market surge: 
 
I have made a lot of money in just a few months by playing the list of stocks Robinhood restricted back in January, as well as WSB pump and dumps. Some of these stocks have high short interest, but many of them are simply pump and dumps being shilled by bullshit WSB accounts. 
 
The key is pretty simple: spend a LOT of time on Reddit, and get out before the pump dumps. 
 
Here’s how you do it: 
 
So basically, recently WSB has been invaded by shills. The sub has totally changed, and it’s now a pump and dump cesspool. 
 
But you can make good money from it. The key is to constantly browse by new in the EARLY morning EST hours (I’m a night owl on the west coast so I just look around 1AM PST), as well as browsing posts from weeks or months earlier. You should know every single stock being talked about on WSB like the back of your hand. 
 
I’ll use CLOV as an example. Back in March, CLOV was the hot ticket pump stock. It got pumped up to $30 and then dumped, and it bottomed out at around $9, where it stayed for several months. Lots of people were left holding the bag. 
 
But after browsing new on WSB one late night/early morning, I noticed that a bunch of **really sketchy accounts** (less than 1k karma, never invested before but suddenly posting huge YOLOs with the “WSB lingo”) were trying to push CLOV again. 
 
There’s a very specific way they do it: first, very rational, very calm posts appear that talk about why CLOV still has massive potential. (This happened around the end of may). 
 
Then, over the next few days or weeks as the stock rises, the posts get more and more manic — until they’re all in all caps, with huge (photoshopped) “YOLO plays,” DEMANDING that you BUY NOW because it’s GOING TO THE MOON. 
 
When that happens, the stock’s about to get dumped. 
 
But as soon as I saw CLOV posts start to resurface in new, I got in at market open at $9. And just like clockwork, the stock rose like crazy over the course of the next week. 
 
When the manic “all in” posts started being spammed on WSB nonstop, CLOV was at $24, and I got out. Less than 24 hours later, the pump got dumped, and now CLOV is back down to $16 and falling fast. 
 
All in all, it was a one-week play that made me 120%+, which is a fantastic return. And it wasn’t just chance. **The upside of WSB being compromised is that once you figure out how the shills operate, you can make a lot of money.** 
 
Just don’t get greedy. For CLOV, I had a limit sell placed at $25, but then I saw the price going up quickly, so I took it off. Of course, once it got to $27 it started getting dumped, so I lost out on profit by selling at $23 instead of the $25 I had predicted. 
 
Don’t try to go for a home run with pump and dumps. Try to hit a double, and if you can do that consistently, you can make a lot of money due to this broken, fucked-up shill world we live in now."

2021-06-10 18:23:00,stocks,"I mean honestly OP, it’s a great system and I would definitely refine it for yourself, but if I was to just recommend one stock to you, it would be GME (disclaimer: not financial advice, just my opinion!). 
 
We just found out yesterday that 100% of all possible votes were recorded at the shareholder meeting, which practically never happens — and since only 100% of the “official” share count is allowed to be reported as voted, getting 100/100% of the vote means there are WAY MORE shares being sold than there are supposed to be. 
 
Which is only possible from naked shorting. 
 
By this point, the GME people are able to predict the illegal manipulation of the stock almost exactly, and the data that’s coming in from overseas means that the possibility of the entire float being naked shorted at least once over is VERY HIGH. 
 
What all this means is that a short squeeze is imminent. No one knows when, or what the catalyst will be, but despite all the wild hype on other subs, the data is solid. 
 
You know that quote from the office “if someone gives you 10,000 to one odds on anything, you take that bet?” 
 
Where the price is at for GME today, it’s a play with huge upside and very little downside. Other stocks have overtaken GME as darlings, but if you want to double your money, that’s the one I would play.  It’s not a “meme stock.” It’s the accidental beneficiary of the stupidest hedge fund bet in Wall Street history. 
 
It sounds ridiculous, I know. But the data is just there, to the point where there’s no other explanation for it that even remotely makes sense.
 
But definitely look at the WSB hype trends as well. The system is being manipulated, but it’s ripe for profit. Godspeed."

2021-06-10 00:00:00,stocks,"APD new facility in Alberta To start this off, I am heavily invested in Suncor and while reading I stumbled across their plans to be net zero among a few other Canadian energy companies. The articles I read stated that they planned to use carbon capture as the main way to reduce their emissions. 

I also read up on APD, and today I read an article that stated that they are setting up a massive, low cost hydrogen facility to be used mainly for carbon capture in Alberta. The article states it's going to be a competitive, efficient, and low cost facility with the intention of providing industrial and transportation for hydrogen infrastructure.

APD is aggressively growing and is currently building a green hydrogen facility in Saudi Arabia as well. The Alberta facility is expected to be finished in 2024. 

I think this company is extremely undervalued, although it currently trades at a 35 p/e. The aggressive growth plans and first movers advantage that this company is going to have in a few years I believe may be overlooked by investors. 

I am also long oil, and believe that hydrogen is the worlds next source of energy, not solar or wind. (Nuclear is good, but I think it will be used minimally.) Projects like these continue to bolster my confidence in that oil and natural gas can be used and scaled while still cutting back emissions. 

Maybe I am reading too much into this, but I believe that APD has a fantastic playbook right now and are very early to the green hydrogen game. I bought more shares today, and I will continue to add to my position. This post doesn't really contain much DD at all, but if anyone is interested in this company I would suggest looking into it, they are fantastic for a long portfolio.

Edit: I've been long APD, not a new position."

2021-06-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Why would one choose to short an ETF? My understanding is that ETF's are generally a very good investment vehicle for the majority of investors because they target a very broad market. This mitigates risk and provides reasonable growth. 

But why would someone short an ETF? How does shorting an ETF even work? It seems like such an odd position to take when you can short a few of the poor looking companies in the ETF itself rather than the ETF as a whole. ETF's are safe investments because they invest in many companies, so why short something that is generally understood to be safe?"
2021-06-09 22:44:39,stocks,"Many ETFs are very narrow in terms of what types of companies they contain.  There are ETFs for each industry group (finance, technology, health, etc), market cap, geographic location, developed vs. developing countries, and so forth.  There are always investors looking to short based on such criteria."
2021-06-09 22:38:51,stocks,"Not all ETFs are created equally. There are some ETFs that perform well and others that perform poorly.

When you short a stock or etf, you do it because you’re betting that it’ll go down in price."
2021-06-09 22:54:42,stocks,"There's really no such thing as ""safe""; it's more a matter of what kind of risk is associated with a type of security.  ETFs are supposed to be designed to spread risk across a sector, or a selected group of stocks that are associated in some fashion (e.g., supply chains of companies in a particular industry).  So shorting an ETF could be motivated by a belief in data, information, or even conjecture that as a whole, it will perform poorly over some time frame."
2021-06-10 15:56:18,stocks,"ETFs do not = safe investment. They are less risky than investing in single company because you are exposed to multiple companies and are not at risk of losing everything if one company goes bankrupt. ETFs do not mean reasonable growth.

ETFs do not necessarily target a broad market. An S&P ETF targets the broad market. Many ETFs target one sector of the market. For example, you could take the United States Oil ETF (USO) as an example which targets the oil sector. It is down 91.32% since 2006. If you believe that oil companies (or a certain sector) is going to decrease in value then short the ETF. 

Shorting an ETF makes sense because it mitigates the risk from shorting a single company. In the example of using an oil company it would make sense to short the USO ETF if you believe oil prices are going to drop as this will likely decrease oil companies value in general. You could short a single company and probably increase the gain (and risk), but that company might discover a massive oil field (or some other event) that temporarily provides a large boost to the share price, causing you as the short to potentially lose a good chunk of money. 

Also, poor looking companies are dangerous to short, they're the ones that can have massive share price increases if something good happens."

It seems that the merger is holding the stock back. Because AMD bought XLNX with shares, XLNX extra share will dilute the AMD share. So if the merger doesnt happen, AMD shares will go up and XLNX will go crashing down.

Also, AMD share will not go up until the merger is finalized. For me, I wont break even until 1 or 2 more Q earnings. Last earnings, the AMD stock went up to $88."

There are a couple of things, off the top of my head, that I can think of as potential drawbacks:

1. Relatively high valuations, especially considering even recent history; just by the idea of a reversion to the mean, poor performance in the short- to mid-term wouldn't be surprising; this isn't even considering the fact that most sites with data for things like P/E don't account for the $1+ billion tax benefit that AMD slapped on their income in the TTM, largely deflating valuations artificially

2. High growth stocks are in the crosshairs ATM for all sorts of reasons, from looming increases in interest rates, parabolic growth in market value, inflation, etc.

3. Demand for AMD's products has been skyhigh in the last year for reasons that may be transitory, including COVID and a frenzy to mine a certain speculative kind of thing that I can't mention

All things considered, it's not so overvalued as to be ridiculous like Tesla or anything. But it's not cheap."

2021-06-10 13:43:32,stocks,"AMD is entirely dependant on TSMC for manufacturing and is in a highly competitive tranche of the market.

TSMC has multiple negative headwinds including a fear of Chinese invasion, water shortages (need a LOT of water for silicon stamping), and the like.

So AMD kind of has all the volatility of being in the chip sector PLUS the volatility of potential TSMC issues.

Also, the Xilinx deal will weigh the AMD stock down due to merger arbitrage. Essentially shorting AMD and going long on Xilinx using the ratio of merger to snag price inefficiencies.

That being said, AMD is a steal at 80! It just may take some time for the market to agree with me.

The Xilinx deal finalizing will push AMD up, even if it's not that great of a deal as merger arbitrage opportunities will be gone.  


SHorts will cover but they will benefit from the cover rise since they got shares of Xilinx and remain delta neutral on the arbitrage.

2021-06-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Optimal Decision Making and Exit Planning Before I begin, I must give major credit to Daniel Kahneman. Much of the thoughts and procedures I'm going to lay out in this post is because I read his wonderful books, ""Thinking Fast and Slow,"" and ""Noise.""

&#x200B;

I am here to propose a procedure to make optimal stock selling decisions by eliminating common things that cause error in judgement. Part 1 of this post will be describing the common errors. Part 2 will discuss weaknesses in current methods. Part 3 will be my new proposed method.

&#x200B;

PART 1: WHAT ARE THE COMMON MISTAKES?

MISTAKE 1: Making decisions out of ignorance. This one is obvious, you should not invest or bet on companies that you do not have a good understanding of. It's fine to come to Reddit to see what companies other people think are good, but you should always follow this up with your own due diligeance.

&#x200B;

MISTAKE 2: Making decisions without addressing your bias. Everyone has bias, and when you own a stock you will certainly have a bias in favor of the stock. There are some reasons you might have bias against a stock such as disliking a person who owns the stock or the way a CEO speaks. Either way positive or negative bias needs to be addressed.

&#x200B;

MISTAKE 3: Making decisions without addressing noise. Noise is all around us and affects us at every moment. Federal Judges give harsher sentences when the weather is hot. Students have different levels of focus in the morning vs right after lunch. You make different decisions based on how well you slept the night before or what kind of mood you are in. Even the music playing in the background has been shown to have significant effects on decision making! An optimal strategy needs to adjust for the noise in your life.

&#x200B;

MISTAKE 4: Making fast decisions on emotion. Kahneman explained in ""Thinking Fast and Slow,"" we all have 2 brains, the fast reactionary brain and the slow logical brain. The reactionary brain is great in an emergency reaction like moving your hand from the fire or running away from a dangerous person with a gun, but making a calculated financial decision should be left to the slow logical thinking brain.

&#x200B;

MISTAKE 5: Not making a decision and leaving it up to chance or letting others make the decision for you. If you believe that you are not smart enough to make decisions on investing in stocks, then it is perfectly fine to invest in SP500 and let it sit until you retire. However, if you believe that you are smart enough to make decisions of buying and selling stocks other then indexes, then it makes no sense to make full decisions on the buying side and letting chance decide when to sell.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

PART 2: WHAT IS WRONG WITH COMMON METHODS?

If you don't have a good idea of the current common exit strategies, you can read about them here: [https://www.investopedia.com/investing/understanding-exit-strategies/](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/understanding-exit-strategies/)

&#x200B;

Common Method 1: STOP LOSS ORDER

&#x200B;

Stop loss order is the worst exit strategy. If a stock is trading at say $10, and you have a stop loss of $8-$9, then you should just sell it at $10! Stop loss order will never be optimal because it is, at every moment in time, less optimal than the simple, ""sell everything now."" 

&#x200B;

Common Method 2: TRAILING STOP LOSS

This method is better than the simple stop loss. The goal of this strategy is not to time the very peak of a stock. That's impossible, but rather to sell just a little after the stock has reached its peak. Here are the problems: look at any stock in the real world that has had a bullish run or a sky rocketing increase. In the middle of the run, I guarentee you will find a moment where the stock dropped 5% for a few minutes at least.

&#x200B;

Big money knows that stop losses are out there and very frequently go Stop Loss Hunting.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stophunting.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stophunting.asp)

&#x200B;

Common Method 3: TECHNICAL INDICATORS

Selling based on Technical Indicators are generally a take-proft exit strategy which is good, but there are two problems with trading on technical indicators. 

One: technical indicators are well known and established, and because of this, can be manipulated. 

Two: technical indicators are for short term trades. No one does technical indicators for a 5 year projection. 

&#x200B;

All short term trades are taxed at the same rate as income tax instead of the better Long Term Capital Gains tax rate (this is assuming you are in the USA). This can result in you paying 15%-20% more on taxes for your gains.

&#x200B;

Technical indicators are fine to use as part of your trading strategy, but not as the entirety of your strategy.

&#x200B;

Common Method 4: COVERED CALLS

Selling Covered Calls is a valid strategy to earn a little extra, however, I'm always reading posts about people who are sad that their covered calls are going to be exercised. If you sell a covered call, you should always assume the shares will be called away, otherwise you are trading with Mistake 5.

&#x200B;

PART 3: NEW PROPOSED METHOD

&#x200B;

I have made a Google Sheets for the process bellow. It does contain my current method for a stock that I own. Anyone is free to make a copy of this google sheet, delete all the cells in green and create your own numbers based on your research for your stock.

&#x200B;

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bVC5oD2A4V64kypra7keQG-SyiATXSNoxvikF2KTAJU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bVC5oD2A4V64kypra7keQG-SyiATXSNoxvikF2KTAJU/edit?usp=sharing)

&#x200B;

1) First you must choose a method (or a few) to model the value of the stock. Common examples are: 

4 x Revenue

P/E ratio of 8-30 depending on the industry

Summation of total future profits discounted to present value (the Buffet Way). 

Sentiment indicators through polls or reddit/twitter activity

2) Come up with a Base Case, Bear Case and Bull Case. Model the values of the stock under each scenario. This is designed to force you to do some DD and eliminate mistake 1.

3) Next, you fill out a Trial using a probability matrix of the chances that you think the base case, bear case, and bull case actually happen.

4) Using the same matrix repeat the trial 5 times with bearish and more bullish outlooks. Instructions are on the spreadsheet. This is designed to lower your bias (mistake 2). 

5) OPTIONAL: If you have a partner OR work as a team with people who also analysis stocks AND have different views about a stock, ask them to also fill out the probibility matrix as well to lower your bias even more (mistake 2).

6) Repeat the model and trials 1-5 on different days, when in different moods, or in the morning versus the night time. This is in order to reduce noise (mistake 3). Each repeat should take you 10 minutes max.

7) Plot/write down each of the results from every trial and every different day. Then use statistics to find your Mean, Variance Pop, Stand Deviation Pop.

8) This will create a bell curve of YOUR true estimates of the price of the stock. 

&#x200B;

NOTE: In a world with everyone having perfect information, this model would represent the true distribution of the price of the stock. However, since you and other buyers do not have perfect information, THIS IS NOT A BELL CURVE OF THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE STOCK. However, the more you know and research the stock, the closer you would get to the actual real distribution.

9) With the distribution of YOUR estimates in front of you, create an algorithm to follow and execute your trades.

10)  WRITE THE ALGORITHM DOWN AND LOOK AT IT EVERYTIME BEFORE YOU PLAN TO SELL. Execute the algorithm to the best of your ability to minimize Mistakes 4 and 5.

11) Each day should try to take 10 minutes to get more plot points for your statistics page. Each day you can tweek your algorithm a little, BUT ONLY RUN TRIALS AND MAKE CHANGES TO THE ALGORITHM WHEN THE MARKET IS CLOSED AND YOU CANNOT TRADE!!!! This is designed to prevent you from making quick emotional decisions (Mistake 4).

&#x200B;

Yes, I know the proposed method will take some work. Maybe it will take 30 minutes to read and understand and about 10 minutes to do each day. Imagine if this process increases your earnings/trades by just $100 a week, I would think most people would find it as time well spent.

&#x200B;

Last thought is that you should probably not share the true results of your algorithm and decisions with anyone you don't personally know. Reddit is a great place to share ideas, but it is a public forum, and anyone might be reading.

&#x200B;

2021-06-09 23:38:53,stocks,"I think the problem with modeling your own valuation and probabilities is that it provides false confidence. Doubtful most of the people on this subreddit are trained in financial analysis, and even if they are, they are not doing as deep of dive as the analyst reports you can get from the brokers.

2021-06-10 04:12:55,stocks,">MISTAKE 2: Making decisions without addressing your bias. Everyone has bias, and when you own a stock you will certainly have a bias in favor of the stock. There are some reasons you might have bias against a stock such as disliking a person who owns the stock or the way a CEO speaks. Either way positive or negative bias needs to be addressed.

I wanted to address this just because there is a common misconception people outside the field of psychology make, and I've noticed it's prevalence with the popularity of Daniel Kahneman's research in popular literature.

Knowing what biases exist will not make you better at recognizing and correcting your own biases. You become more aware of them in other people, but you'll be continuously ineffective at being able to remove biases from your decision making, regardless of knowledge or effort. 

Infact that was much of what Kahneman and Tversky's work was set out to prove. That very fact. That no matter how smart and knowledgeable you are, you are still subject to fall victim to the same biases as any other human. After decades in the field and a Nobel prize to his name, when asked if all his work on biases and heuristics has helped him become a better investor Daniel Kahneman still says ""No, I still make the same mistakes I always have"".

If anything being aware of your biases will either cause you to realize that your biases are inherent and unavoidable thus causing you to over weight their importance on your decision making, or you will likely become over confident in your ability to correct a bias and thus underweight its actual effect.

The purpose of Kahneman's work isn't about correcting biases and fixing human flaws, it's about accepting that they exist and learning how to function in a world where that is true. 

Mostly by creating a rules based method of decision making that is applied systematically when the event occurs for the decision to be made."

2021-06-10 07:53:36,stocks,"Thanks for posting this! I say this regularly, but I think its important to talk about strategies as much as it is important to talk about individual stocks.

I think the only way to really growth wealth is based on the core principles you outlined:

- Don't be an emotional investor.

- Pick a strategy and stick with it. Continue to test it and make future projections based on that strategy. Don't abandon the strategy just because of short term (ie. 3-6 month) price fluctuations in the market. Zoom out and having bigger picture in mind.

- Managing risk.

I think the ""managing risk"" part combined with ""don't be emotional"" is where the vast majority of investors/traders trip up. When a stock goes down, they feel like they took on too much risk as their account starts to lose money. But that's not the case! Managing risk is about understanding things like Beta, price movement, having space cash on hand to average down, etc. Managing risk isn't about ""selling a stock when it goes down"". Only sell a stock when the fundamentals have changed and you no longer believer in its growth trajectory or value proposition."

2021-06-09 23:50:16,stocks,"Using thinkorswim model is fine.

I think you were missing the points. They are:

\- Using any model is better than using no model and just trading on gut feeling or stop loss.

\- You need to model several times to get rid of the noise in your life and the best way to aggregate that data is with a simple bell curve.

\- You need to write down your results and some basic instructions to yourself to keep yourself from making an emotional split second decision. An algorithm to follow is the best, but 1 or 2 simple instructions to yourself is just a simple algorithm.

My model is just a simple sample. Of course there are better models out there."
2021-06-10 17:25:22,stocks,"Thank you for taking the time to write out a thoughtful response. Yes there is much about psychology I don't know. 

I also agree that we cannot eliminate all biases. However, when you say, ""If anything being aware of your biases will either cause you to realize that your biases are inherent and unavoidable thus causing you to over weight their importance on your decision making, or you will likely become over confident in your ability to correct a bias and thus underweight its actual effect."" 

To me, it sounds like you are saying it is better to be unaware of your bias than to acknowledge and try to adjust for it, which I simply do not agree with. From a personal point of view, once I acknowledged my bias towards Loss Aversion, I was able to use math to get a better idea of what my risk tolerance is vs what it should be.

I didn't write down the name of the study, but in Chapter 9 of ""Noise,"" Kahneman referenced a study that specifically instructed the participants to simply imagine a more optimistic version and a more pessimistic version of themselves. Then the study showed that the sum of squares created a more statistically significantly accurate prediction. However, all parties acknowledge that the accuracy increase is no where near perfect and usually around a 3%-10% benefit. I consider a 3% to 10% benefit huge when it comes to the gains I can make from my investing.

I do agree with your assessment that: ""The purpose of Kahneman's work isn't about correcting biases and fixing human flaws, it's about accepting that they exist and learning how to function in a world where that is true. Mostly by creating a rules based method of decision making that is applied systematically when the event occurs for the decision to be made.""

That is why I think it is important for people to take time to really THINK and analyze to create a system/set of rules/algorithm to execute their selling.

Lastly, since you seem very knowledgeable about the field, I'd like to ask if you had any good recommendations for some more books to read. I'm a big fan of behavior economics, decision making, and game theory. Thanks!"
2021-06-10 00:04:45,stocks,"Though I disagree with your assessment and ability to read the 10Q published by that stock, this post is not meant to discuss a specific stock.

In the book ""Noise,"" behavioral economist ran several controlled studies and realized that when a person (Let's just say Paul - not a real person - I just pulled a Beatle's name) makes a model of their own decision making, and then Paul follows that model... the model of Paul performs 75% better then simply letting the real Paul make his own decisions. They ran this test for all sorts of things such as:

\- Guessing the weight of a cow

\- Guessing the weather on a date

\- Guessing the price of a stock on a date

Behavioral economist also tested various instructions given to participants such as imagine for your next model to think like a more optimistic or pessimistic version of yourself. They realized that this simple act reduced Bias by a statistically significant amount (Thought obviously not completely. It is impossible to completely remove bias).

You can change the parameters for the trial and number of trials, but addressing bias towards and against a subject is important.

If Trial 5 is higher than Trial 3, then you are more affected by positive noise than you are of negative bias. If the reverse is true, then you are more affected by negative bias than positive noise."
2021-06-10 00:03:01,stocks,"You don't need a model to make rational decisions on investing. You can pick stocks that meet a few criteria, such as PE, momentum, analyst price targets, like the product, etc. and not need a model. I would counter that the best advice would not be to model and test or throw in probabilities that are likely just made up, but instead have a thesis for why you are purchasing. Then keep an eye on it with regards to that original reasoning and follow news, earnings, analyst reports."
2021-06-10 18:08:36,stocks,"I'd be happy to recommend some reading, although if you're reading Kahneman idk if I can recommend much which you haven't read or aren't familiar with. But I'm happy to share some favorite authors. 

Robert Shiller and Richard Thaler are two pioneers in behavioral economics worth reading.

Annie Duke and Dan Ariely both have books that are worth reading. Thinking in Bets. Predictably Irrational.

The Hot Hand by Ben Cohen is a fun read. It's one of the few times Kahneman had his ideas successfully challenged.

The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel is newer and a personal favorite. 

William J. Bernstein may be worth reading. He recently came out with a book called The Delusions of Crowds with is very good. 

If you've already read these books or authors great!

I will say one thing I think goes overlooked when trying to learn about a subject is how important it is to branch out from that subject. Psychology, Economics, and even Sociology are broad fields with a lot to learn about. 

Learning more about each, even those not directly related to behavioral economics, provides new perspectives and ways of interpreting and understanding information."
2021-06-10 17:47:08,stocks,">To me, it sounds like you are saying it is better to be unaware of your bias than to acknowledge and try to adjust for it

I can be more clear hear. 

It's good to be aware of your biases, and others. I tried to summarize this point at the end of my comment, but I can go into more detail to make it clear.

Knowing about your bias won't consistently make you a better decision maker throughout your life in the moment of making a decision.

But what it can do is allow you to create a system of rules and methods of making decisions. 

You develop this system away from the stimuli that would force you to make the decision so you are less prone to be less affected by the bias.

You then develop a strategy to implement this form of systematic decision making when the time comes to make the decision.

Kahneman describes something like this in the book Noise. Where an expert in the field of medicine will create a list, and weight the list, of symptoms and use that to help make diagnosis.

Now despite all the experts knowledge and experience when the moment comes to make that decision they are still impacted by biases and ""noise"" as Kahneman describes it.

This is why when they use a simple model, designed by the same expert, to make the diagnosis it out performs the expert consistently. Because the model doesn't pick up any bias.

Kahneman talks about fast and slow thinking. When you are in a period of decision making you are using your fast thinking mechanism. No matter how well trained or knowledgeable you are, and that part of your decision making is always prone to biases in order to create efficient decision making.

So what you do is create a model for the decisions you know you will have to make when you can operate using your slow thinking system. 

Then when the moment comes, instead of using your fast thinking system, you deploy your model, which is essentially an efficient way to deploy your slow thinking process, during a period where you will naturally revert to fast thinking mechanisms.


I hope I helped clear this up. Learning about biases is great, because you learn how to counter act them, not how to eliminate them. But understanding that difference is important, because like I said earlier, believing you eliminated a bias will only make you underweight its effect on your decisions."

The contract doesnt need to be in the money for you to sell to close it. When buying a Call option, as long as the price increase from the point you bought it, you might make some money. The premium will always adjust depending on where the price of the stock is.

So if you bought the call option when it was at $9.50 and now the price of the stock is at 10.50. You can already sell it and make a profit out of it option. It doesnt need to reach $11."

And ETF is a bundled set of investments managed by experts. There's a logic behind it, and it's often meant to be better than what you could put together on your own.

So start with studying the target ETFs and understanding why they are bundled the way they are. Sometimes starting investors just machine-gun invest into a bunch of ETFs which can result in redundant holdings, either by buying the same assets or by buying into ETFs that are too similar in intention.

To start, you'd be best off understanding and picking one or two ETFs you really trust and match your goals, and then let them do their job.

(total amount of money put into stock / divided by total amount of shares bought) x the total amount of shares I currently own.

And then I would just subtract this number from the current value of this stock x the amount of shares I own, and that would be my profit on my currently owned shares.

**About rare earth metals** 

What are rare earth metals? They are a group of 17 elements: lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium all found in rare deposits. The thing about these “rare” metals is that they are actually quite common in the earth’s crust. However, the difficulties in the extraction process of these metals is what gives them their name. These metals are used in just about anything electronic, rechargeable batteries, magnets, computers, lasers, fiber optics, superconductors and vehicles. Not only are they used in electric vehicles in batteries and motors, but they are also used in catalytic converters. Over the last 5-6 years prices of rare earth metals have risen because they are “rare”, but they are also very costly to refine in environmentally friendly ways. This has also spurred the growth of catalytic converter theft which has become a growing nuisance. Recyclers have been paying up to $250 per unit to almost anyone that's willing to supply them. Nearly 60% of rare earths metals that were imported in 2018 were [used for catalytic converters](https://geology.com/articles/rare-earth-elements/). 

The majority of the global “rare metal” supply is owned by China, thus they control most of the supply chain. Due to China’s dominance in this sector the United States, along with the rest of the world, is very susceptible to China’s pricing or supply disruption (tariffs/export ban/pricing pressure). According to this [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-rareearth-explainer/explainer-u-s-dependence-on-chinas-rare-earth-trade-war-vulnerability-idUSKCN1T42RP), “The United States imported $160 million of rare earth compounds and metals in 2018, up nearly 17% from 2017. Around 60% of it was used in catalysts for oil refining and in vehicle engines.”

**The SP@C merger**

On November 17, of 2020 Fortress Value Acquisition Corp (FVAC) closed a SP@C merger deal with [$345 Million in cash in trust and a $200 Million](https://investorintel.com/markets/technology-metals/technology-metals-intel/us-rare-earths-industry-comeback-begun-mp-materials-announces-nyse-listing-via-merger-fvac/?print=print) PIPE led by the SP@C King himself Chamath Palihapitiya. The combined company was set at a valuation of $1.5 Billion with over $500 million in cash to fund the growth strategy and was labeled MP Materials.

&#x200B;

**Government’s acceptance of clean energy and strengthening supply chains**

Over the term of the Trump presidency the trade war with China had intensified leaving companies with tariffs and questionable supply chains. This economic race had set the stage for MP Materials. With tariffs on imports and unfavorable pricing from China on rare earth materials it leaves a very volatile question mark for US manufacturers and other related companies. Flash forward to 2021 with the Biden administration, not only is the government trying to turn the table on [strengthening its own supply chains](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/02/24/fact-sheet-securing-americas-critical-supply-chains/), it's also trying to eliminate its vulnerabilities. The pandemic has shown us the necessities of medicine, essential goods and things like semiconductors should be made in the United States and this was reinforced by the executive order signed by President Biden in February. 

On the list of critical goods to be evaluated within the first 100 days was specifically rare earth metals. This clearly demonstrates how MP Materials being the only miner and refiner of these materials in the United States could profit. The other larger mention on the executive order was large capacity batteries such as those used in electric cars. I would highly recommend reviewing the order as there are so many industries that were mentioned that all use rare earth metals related to MP Materials.

A long term investor may see the importance of rare earth metals in terms of being a critical factor to the US economy. After the 100 day review is completed somewhere around the beginning of June there is no doubt MP Materials will be listed as a critical company and will have an overwhelming support of the US Government. Not only will this secure MP Materials as a local monopoly, but it will solidify local business supply chains for years to come. Also, with a critical infrastructure bill in the works the company could be on the list to receive subsidies to level the playing field with China. MP Materials’ rare earth concentrate product represents [15% of the world’s supply](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200715005276/en/MP-Materials-Leading-Producer-Rare-Earth-Materials). 

**Expected increase in demand of rare metals**

With the rise of electric vehicles starting to enter the manufacturing plants of US automakers the demand of rare earth metals will be growing *exponentially*. If you take a moment to look at the slide deck of the investor presentation from MP Materials, the business is currently in early days of stage 2. 

&#x200B;

MP Materials is mining NdPr materials (mainly Neodymium and Praseodymium), which power the **strongest types of rare earth magnets**. These magnets are used to power EVs (electric vehicles) and many industrial processes. This is why the mining of these rare earth metals play a vital role in the EV market. After mining these materials, MP Materials then **ships them to China** (they rely on plants in China to actually process the mined materials) while incurring a VAT tax and tariffs to be refined and is still turning a profit. MP Materials is set to open the largest NdPr separation facility in the world in 2022 and are putting stage II into motion. NdPr is an essential piece used in magnets especially in EV motors. Stage III shows they are looking to actually produce NdPr magnets onsite sometime past 2025 which would make them even more vertically integrated.

Demand from electric vehicles, wind turbines, and other technologies is hitting an inflection point. The shift in clean energy and electrification of transport, globally, will be an important theme *over the next decade*. The demand for rare earths will rapidly outpace the current levels of production and supply. Take a look at the forecasted price of NdPr over the next several years.

&#x200B;

From the MP Materials investor presentations, we’ve pulled some of the charts where they forecast demand for electric vehicle magnets due to the high demand of EV sales compared to regular vehicle.

&#x200B;

It is clear that this is not just a “rare earth metal” play, but they will be particularly focused on NdPr which will be driven by clean energy industries, and more specifically electric vehicles.

**Potential Risks**

A company that entails rare earth mining, such as MP Materials, will be subject to typical risks that surround commodities. Right now we are in a “super-cycle”, but how long will that last? Since China also supplies up to 80% of the world’s rare earth materials there is also the potential of risks associated with the pricing pressure. Lastly, there are some advancements in synthetically creating materials that replace these rare metals, but not enough conclusions have been drawn in the validity of this topic.

**Valuation**

Now like any SP@C it's hard to give accurate projections more than 3 years out, but the rare earth metal market has had prices nearly double this year which has led to a pretty sharp increase in the stock price already. Not to mention, unlike some SP@Cs this is a company that is already generating products and profits. The most recent analyst coverage has near term price targets between $37 and $57. In the last 3 weeks there has been a rise in the 10 Year yield and that has made the technology sector and SP@Cs become unfavorable. Like several other stocks, it appears MP Materials is the baby being thrown out with the bathwater, the stock has retraced from its $51.77 52-week high significantly. Now the company did report an excellent 4th quarter surpassing expectations on March 18th. More recently the company announced it wanted to raise 600 million in a senior debt offering that would not come due until 2026. There was some concern that this could dilute the stock when it comes due, but this is over 5 years from now. This free cash will allow MP Materials to speed up its timeline and reduce costs by operating its own NdPr separation facility. With the speculation of a commodity super cycle and rising inflation coming the price of rare earth metals will continue to strengthen. This appears to be a potentially great value investment, and the upcoming 100 day review in June from the Biden administration will only further strengthen the importance of MP Materials in the US Economy.

Having said that, the company’s original valuation in the merger was set to 1 billion dollars (1.5 billion minus 500 million to fund expansions). At the moment of writing, the company’s market cap is sitting at roughly 6 billion. We want to determine if the current valuation is pricing the company at fair value, given the potential the company has. This is not an easy task given the complexities of the rare earth metal industry and also the lack of “competitors”. This is not a “growth stock”, nor is it strictly a commodity play. In my opinion we can look at it as a play on Neodymium and Praseodymium (NdPr) which is where the pricing outlook and largest growth expected over the next 10 years is very strong. It is my opinion that MP Material’s growth will be somewhat reflected by the demand of the EV market as well as the progression of other clean energy industries where the use of these metals is critical. If the EV market were to increase tenfold, I think MP Materials would also benefit greatly by proxy.

**Final Thoughts**

1. China currently has somewhat of a monopoly on rare earth materials, currently providing about 80% of the world’s supply. This allows them the capability to create pricing pressure (which they have done in the past) and control the supply to hurt their competitors.
2. At this moment in time, MP Materials is currently mining the materials, then sending them off to China for processing all while still maintaining a profit. MP Materials will eventually be processing these rare earth materials in their own processing plants. The company is working on vertical integration for the entire process from start to finish.
3. The most significant of these metals is NdPr, which power some of the strongest magnets used specifically in the electric vehicles and wind turbines (clean energy).
4. MP Materials stock price is already trading at a hefty valuation relative to what the stock price was post-merger. However, this company’s revenues will also be reflected by the strong demand (and trend) driven by the increase in EV sales.
5. Considering these metals will play a vital role in many tech industries moving forward, they may receive substantial support from the government. The Biden administration has already put in motion a plan to strengthen it’s own supply chains to remove vulnerabilities. Rare earth metals are specifically on this list.

I honestly believe small to midcap American companies with innovation potential are going to see astronomical gains because of the combination of infrastructure spending and speculative investing. Money is going to be racing into these companies before it's too late. Companies such as Asensus Surgical (ASXC), Capstone Green Energy (CGRN), Ceco Environmental (CECE), Meatech (MITC), UR Energy (URG), Agrify (AGFY), Vision Marine (VMAR), CNSL, CMLS, EBIX, PKE, RMTI, FSTR, Genie Energy (GNE), GHM, GIFI, LFVN, Aemetis (AMTX), ATNI, and Audacy (AUD) could likely fly. I also like innovative small to midcap Chinese companies. There's the country risk that everyone talks about, but that's the whole reason companies like them are undervalued in the first place. High risk very high reward. Companies like HUYA, WIMI, ZEPP, DOYU, JKS, JWEL, IFBD, MOMO, BLCT, MKD, etc. A ton of cheap innovation with high gains potential. There could be a smear campaign going on to keep these shares cheap long enough for rich connected folk to get all their money in. It obviously isn't a certainty, but worth the gamble if you ask me. I think eventually, supply chains will correct (inflation will be less of a concern), and China and the US will have some sort warming of relations in conjunction with rising private property rights in China to secure growth and avoid volatility (Chinese stocks will be more sought after). If these two things occur, and honestly, even if they don't, many of the companies listed here could reach market caps above 20 billion USD, making even investments of under $1000 in buying plain old shares worth lots of gains. Imagine options.

TLDR: Small to midcap innovation is the place to invest, regardless of financials because speculation is running rampant and everyone wants cake. China is worth considering if you don't mind the risk."

Typically the stocks will go up leading to a split because it allows more trading, as mentioned, but the underlying company value remains the same.

2021-06-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Have not been trading for a while, seems like things are getting better? Started Q4 of last year, come 2021 things were horrible and I lost money and basically just stopped and waited. Things seem to be getting better, influx of meme stocks squeezing/spiking, tech seems to be recovering, just wondering how things are looking overall before I start trying to get back into things. I realize no one has the answers, just looking for an idea of how things are looking overall and compared to say 2-3 months ago."

2021-06-10 00:24:10,stocks,best time to invest is when you think the sky is falling and you should cash out to stop the bleeding. be greedy when everyone is fearful and be fearful when everyone is greedy
2021-06-10 06:23:03,stocks,"That’s a little too black and white. Sometimes you average down and sometimes you cut bait. Although I agree patience and temperance are helpful traits for a trader, markets don’t  give a fuck about your confidence in a stock. Sometimes the opportunity  cost of averaging down is another more viable investment."

**Transcript from chairman Ryan Cohen from today's shareholder meeting:**

""We ushered in a whole new era of GameStop. On a personal note, I want you to know I’m humbled to be elected to your board and serve as your Chairman. We have a lot of work in front of us, and it will take time. We’re trying to do something that nobody in the retail space has ever done but we believe we’re putting the right pieces in place and we have clear goals: delighting customers and driving shareholder value for the longterm. The management team and refreshed board will remain totally focused on these goals at all times. We know some people want us to lay out a whole detailed plan today, but that’s not gonna happen. You won’t find us talking a big game, making a bunch of lofty promises, or telegraphing our strategy to the competition. That’s the philosophy we adopted at Chewy. Here are a few things we’ve done so far: refresh the board, added technology and retail experience to the leadership team, paid off all our long term debt and strengthened the balance sheet, and begun laying the foundation for long term growth. Moving forward, we want you to judge GameStop based on our actions, not our words. Thank you everyone, and as my dad would say, “buckle up."""""
2021-06-10 08:21:21,stocks,Could someone please explain why EBITA dropped so significantly and how to interpret it in the context ?
2021-06-09 21:07:10,stocks,There are too many apes in here *squints eyes*
2021-06-10 06:53:44,stocks,Since when do earnings matter for gamestop? Not like it's trading based on those results.
2021-06-09 22:58:51,stocks,"Ok I gotta admit...this was actually a better earnings call than I expected. The only disappointing thing was the planned dilution, but other than that, it looks promising...."
2021-06-10 09:23:47,stocks,What about the potential there may be an additional 5m shares sold? How likely is this and how does it play into the SI% narrative?
2021-06-09 22:04:08,stocks,Much games.
2021-06-10 00:36:55,stocks,"Following this trend, they will have a net loss of $0 in the 2nd quarter, and probably end the year with a positive number."
2021-06-09 22:17:54,stocks,"$GME is not a meme stock anymore. This will be a solid fundamentals based long term play. Holding strong.  So much potential in the gaming, egaming and e-commerce business."

2021-06-10 02:27:11,stocks,I sit on the sidelines on this one just for the entertainment. There's absolutely no reason to be anything but bullish on GME at this point. Ryan Cohen tries to turn this around real quick.
2021-06-10 08:41:27,stocks,"This is all good news, and yet after hours price tanked by $20... interesting, just makes you think.."
2021-06-10 14:43:14,stocks,Imagine thinking buying GME based off fundamentals. People have truly gone off the deep end.
2021-06-10 07:00:53,stocks,I feel for people who still think this was or still is a meme stock 😬
2021-06-09 20:47:41,stocks,Bullish . Buy and hold
2021-06-10 08:07:20,stocks,Crazy that a company that's been ripping their customers off for years and treating their employees like shit has made such a comeback
2021-06-10 08:46:28,stocks,Nobody even buys videogames anymore. Its all digital.  What kind of moron thinks GME is going to be successful moving forward.
2021-06-09 20:39:22,stocks,Well the sale of 5 million shares would instantly make them profitable am buckled up
2021-06-10 09:15:28,stocks,Looking forward to how they will be using NFT’s in the near future. Should be seeing an announcement in July!
2021-06-10 14:35:17,stocks,Well… that sounds like a bad company tbh.
2021-06-10 10:11:07,stocks,"Tldr:

Still no plan on how to survive past physical disks, ecommerce or not. Mystery and speculation apparently is better for the share price than them saying what it is and forcing you to cross ideas off. 

Huge share issuance going to be dumped on retail investors

Business still in decline but a little bit of covid relief and maybe reflexivity out of the stock hype

New management team is an e-commerce team, not the type of team you’d want to enter other parts of the game industry that have a bright future

The SEC thing I don’t find concerning though. Company seems like the lawyers were running things.,"
2021-06-09 21:30:24,stocks,"so, i bought AMC and GME just to sell calls.... at this point, just keep the iv high and i am happy"

Gme Price isnt a reflection of fundamentals."
2021-06-10 07:02:23,stocks,Only 5 Million? I'd be selling 10's of millions at this valuation.
2021-06-10 03:17:48,stocks,"Just a quick note here that will probably be overlooked. Paul Raines, the previous GME CEO was a really great guy who cared about the future of the company. I used to work in a position that was somewhat close to him and his family (vague on purpose) and got to speak with him regularly. Amazing guy - listened to his employees' input, that of reddit and the internet, his customers, and also that of his shareholdholders. Neat to see, but clearly stressful. 

I wont say that all CEOs are angels, because they're clearly not, but Paul taught me that there are some good people out there who do well for themselves but who are dealt a shit stack of cards. I hope his family has found a route to success off of this, because his wife and children were always so kind. They also clearly took his passing hard and I was always so worried for them; but the nature of my role wouldn't allow me to reach out. Best of luck and love, Raines family, and I hope that you've found so way to turn this absurdity into a form of success for your family."
2021-06-10 07:25:12,stocks,BULLISH ASF!

2021-06-10 16:00:38,stocks,"When people ask me why GME, I tell them I’m happily invested in a company who decided to transform their company by paying off all their debt and shifting their business perspective 180 to a much more positive direction. Brand new team of avengers assembled and not to mention this is a company thats 100% focused on customer experience. Underneath all the technical analysis or fundamentald etc, isnt this what investing is all about?"
2021-06-10 10:49:32,stocks,Still redddddd
2021-06-10 02:20:24,stocks,And of course the stock goes up immediately after I sell ffs
2021-06-10 15:20:38,stocks,Please check Astrazeneca as it is massively short sold right now.
2021-06-09 21:00:11,stocks,Personally I would of filmed it live during a monster truck show. Would of been more fitting.maybe some pyro. 25% increase BOOM!
2021-06-10 00:48:42,stocks,"“Buckle up, buckeroo”"
2021-06-10 00:22:54,stocks,This provides absolutely zero answer as to what they are actually selling me. What do they have to offer to your average gamer who’s favorite marketplace is steam? I fear a lot of the folks here are unfamiliar with the digital gaming marketplace and heavily overestimate the actual potential here. Read all the words in that quote carefully. They are hollow and empty. There’s zero substance.
2021-06-09 23:43:40,stocks,"""buckle up""

he sure knows how to hype shit up.

&#x200B;

What do people imagine Gamestop becoming? Some esports behemoth? with their existing small ass stores?

or becoming an online powerhouse? meh.

I'm a realist. I can't imagine what gamestop can do that hasn't been done already

&#x200B;

selling pc parts???!    
That's what amazon, best buy, and newegg have already been doing for ages."
2021-06-09 20:04:05,stocks,We like the stock
2021-06-09 20:46:05,stocks,Every single ETF containing GME was shorted today. The largest on the Russell 2000 was shorted 90%.
2021-06-09 20:45:18,stocks,"> genuinely don't know how they managed to get out of that situation

I’m part of the group relying on the idea that they didn’t do that"
2021-06-09 21:54:32,stocks,"I got into gme for shits and giggles AFTER it dropped from 500. I felt bad for the little guy and thought I'll throw in some money and willingly be a bag holder. 

Since then, just the amount of effort MSM has put into making people ""forget GameStop"" or vilifying retail and Reddit tells me something is off. Why focus so much on something that's irrelevant or history.

Second has been the price manipulation and stock volume. Up until last week I think the stock had a daily volume of 4mil against 3 month average of 16 million. That average has been shrinking as well. In comparison, other 'meme stocks' has been flipping 5-8x their average volume (BB, AMC et al).

I do like the stock. I do think it can be an amazing revival story. If anyone can do it, I think Cohen's team can. I have great memories of taking my nephew to GameStop. 

I'm not American, but even I loved toys R us, and I read about how vulture funds drove it to the ground. America has an extremely toxic financial culture.

I'm in it to see where it goes, with just as much as I'm afford to lose. If it moons, yeay. If it goes to 40, I'll buy more. To me it seems like someone screwed up bad, and if nothing else the entertainment has been worth it."
2021-06-09 22:20:36,stocks,"If they got out of it, it wouldn’t still be at the level it’s at—and climbing. They literally had to erase the buy button to not crash the entire system"
2021-06-10 07:28:30,stocks,"Imagine amazon, but it doesn't suck. And only does gamer stuff.

>sold in january

You got january prices in march. And yesterday. And especially on tuesday. Let me tell you, tuesday had some really january-y prices. For like two hole hours, not just a short tiny spike."
2021-06-10 07:10:26,stocks,"IMO Gamestop is looking to become a direct competitor to Amazon in terms of electronics, NFTs, art, street wear, resale market, video games, toys and even more. 

The missing component of Amazon is those markets and I can clearly see how the future of gamestop may unravel. Closing or digitizing the brick and motor stores or using them as a warehouse, pick up or distribution center is another option. 

In this economy gamestop has the ability to also scoop up more commercial space for cheap as well."
2021-06-10 07:32:26,stocks,The JUST got a new CEO. They haven't even started transforming to e-commerce. That all is just prep work.
2021-06-09 20:50:00,stocks,"Well Robin da hood restricting buying along with others is one reason they were able to get out of it in January. On top of more massive naked shorting and people having stop losses. People had stop losses in early March too, but now I believe most people have caught on."
2021-06-10 06:16:01,stocks,"Genuinely like the stock. But the earnings did not project this at all

> Gamestop is succesfully transitioning to e-commerce, especially the sales improvement

Software game sales were up 4% compared to an industry average of 42%. Sure console sales were up, but you can't rely on a company running on fumes to be depending on a 7-year upgrade cycle. Their debts and losses are still concerning for the long term shareholders. The stock sales announced should spook short term shareholders as well"
2021-06-09 20:56:26,stocks,Nice essay dude(/ette). No /s.
2021-06-09 22:19:28,stocks,"3 month period ending May 1st.  Seems like something happened last year in March that was pretty big.

Also new console cycle."
2021-06-09 23:17:40,stocks,With less stores too.
2021-06-09 20:24:35,stocks,"In January they had what has to have been one of the largest free marketing campaigns of all time because of the stock and the drama behind it. I knew they’d crush these earnings for that reason alone. Idk if the extra interest will start though.

Edit: Meant ""stay"" instead of ""start"" for that last line."
2021-06-09 21:36:49,stocks,Well mr beast did buy everything in a couple GameStop stores..
2021-06-10 12:39:24,stocks,"By pushing e-commerce, a new console generation, and free marketing?"
2021-06-09 20:11:34,stocks,I’m going to take a guess and say…. They sold 25% more times ?

2021-06-09 20:13:17,stocks,They diluted for half a billion a few weeks ago and nobody even noticed.
2021-06-10 08:23:51,stocks,They matter to help expose the disconnect between how the stock _should_ act vs how it _does_ act
2021-06-09 21:13:57,stocks,At the end of the day people found out that they tried to short gme to oblivion so much so that they created an ungodly amount of naked shorts  and are now in process of a tug of war that retail is winning that will start the moass
2021-06-10 09:50:31,stocks,"Seems the cult has changed the story from short squeeze to fundamentals, NFT, and the transformation of GameStop. 

The whole NFT thing seems like a solution looking for a problem. NFT is going to propel GameStop to the moon, if only they can figure out a way to use it."
2021-06-10 07:02:44,stocks,Lmao holy hell that's a lot of delusion
2021-06-09 22:00:23,stocks,"Downvoting someone because they took profits, in a stocks subreddit.

The GME cancer should be cut out of this subreddit."
2021-06-10 09:49:06,stocks,What does it make you think about? A sell-off on good earnings is very common in the stock market.
2021-06-10 15:21:59,stocks,"Imagine sitting on huge profits with GME at 300, not selling because you believed the MOASS narrative, and watching it plunge 30% in a day … AGAIN.

2021-06-10 09:38:07,stocks,"Just because YOU and I download our games from steam doesn't mean there arent 10000000 14 year old kids around the world who buy physical copies. Just saying the future is bright for gamestop. They are no longer focusing solely on physical retail space. They have no debt and a slew of new board members and corporate leaders with pertinent background in the online space.

Irregardless the physical game business isn't a dead cat, either. It is in decline, I agree, but it isn't a dead cat.

It is a different world post pandemic, and the US market has shifted towards online delivery drastically in the past 2 years to accommodate the stay at home lifestyle. Was in Indianapolis a few weeks ago, impossible to get an uber...why? They make more cash delivering food, groceries, and same day deliveries.

TL;DR - Post pandemic markets are ready to transition from brick and mortar retail to the online space. GME is positioned to pounce on the market, much unlike a dead cat."
2021-06-10 11:36:26,stocks,"Complete horseshit and anecdotal. I buy digital, three of my friends swear by physical releases and consoles. They're collectors and there will always be a market for physical media"
2021-06-10 13:41:00,stocks,"I will buy physical until the last disc is pressed.  You cant resell digital and  they can remove it from their stores at any time, while I will still be able to play it with my disc. Hell PSN threatened to remove the vita and ps3 digital store recently ffs. 

I can also resell my disc at any time for whatever price I want.

That being said, gamestop is still crap for giving you pennies on the dollar for trade ins and I will never give them my business over a private seller with better prices. 

All these cultists praising the company have such short memories about how shitty they treat their employees and customers. Ethics and morality fly out the window when they can make a profit from it."

Same company, different name. Well, one day I was at Walmart and needed a PS5 controller, so I left and went to EB Games. My little brother needed some Switch accessories, I took him to EB Games. Gift cards, little toys for my daughter = EB Games. They are putting their efforts in the right places and I will continue to hold and shop there."

 Now that I hold shares in the company you bet that's even more reinforced. Besides Ring Fit I've bought a controller, a mouse, a few other accessories, and 6 games from them which I wouldn't have otherwise."

But the real big thing that they can do (which is mostly speculation at the moment) is make their NFT's worth something. We know they will have an NFT of some form, they are also hiring block chain experts...to me this sounds like they're trying to find a way to resell digital copies of games, which if that's true that could be huge. Imagine being able to even get a 10th back of what you've spent on Steam, Origin, X-Box Live, PSN, GOG, etc. that would be a massive game changer (no pun intended)."
2021-06-10 03:36:44,stocks,"I mean look at the people involved. Tons of super high-ups from Amazon and other massive retail companies and the guy who put Chewy on the map. Amazon sells pet food, Chewy does it better. If someone has the know-how and the ability to, they can easily take on certain aspects of an over-reaching behemoth. Of course this is all speculation, but with the closing of Frys, and the multiple locations of Game Stop, there is a hole in the market for physical PC components (once the chip shortage ends), and I could easily see Game Stop filling that void. They clearly already have a distribution chain for it, it's not like they're starting from scratch. The advantage someone like Game Stop has over someone like NewEgg is that they can have physical stores, no waiting months for a part to be delivered and hopefully not fucked up in the mail. The advantage over somewhere like Best Buy is the ability to zone in. Best Buy sells car stereos, computer screens, and cell phone plans, but they don't sell the best versions of any of those. Game Stop is only catering to the gamer, so no need to carry printers, dish washers, and flat screen mounts, instead they could carry graphics cards, mother boards, and cases.

2021-06-10 07:04:54,stocks,"They definitely didn't, even on a base level just look at the facts. There were a good amount of calls in January and pretty much ever since that would've cause at the very least a slight gamma squeeze, add on the buying pressure from everyone fomoing in. There is just no way HFs were able to exit their positions without the price going to around 1000 at least. Personally I think they started to cover then realised very quickly they weren't able to, that's just speculation though. If they had truly covered, you wouldn't see so much suspicious shit around the stocks, the near identical price movement to AMC, the incredibly sharp artificial drops that match up perfectly with other stocks, the shorting of ETFs that contain GME. The true extent is unknown but it's very clear that something is still going on."

2021-06-10 07:14:31,stocks,"Well at the most basic level, their charted earnings visually represent half of what they were in 2016, but their market cap is 4.5x what it was in 2016. With no super obvious growth areas. They were making money in 2016 to hemorrhaging cash by 2018 and they have yet to post a positive TTM period. 

The nearest retailer to GME in terms of market cap is dollar tree. They made money last reported TTM. Over a billion. That’s a pretty important fundamental measure that current market cap doesn’t seem to warrant. I guess Etsy is pretty close to GME. Etsy also made money. Half a billion. 

Tractor supply is a smaller market cap. They made money. Over a billion TTM. 

Burlington Stores is the first retailer I can find anywhere near GME that didn’t make money TTM. They have a smaller market cap than GME, but they went from positive earnings pre covid to negative earnings during covid. GME doesn’t have such a story. 

The point is, they’re an established retailer playing in a market cap range where established retailers have 1-2bn in earnings and growth retailers have 0.5bn in earnings. GME is -0.5bn

Earnings is not the only fundamental but it sort of drives many fundamentals that people look at. And it’s easy to review a list of to make a dumb comment like this."

If you were to say they were just staying with their old retail store, new and used games, I’d say you’re right. Except they’re not. I’m not even a gamer and I like the company. They have more than just games and they are finding and capitalizing on these opportunities.

Businesses can’t turn around overnight. They are going in the right direction. Most e-commerce companies trade what, 25 times P/E? Even if you don’t consider it an e-commerce company fully they have a lot of opportunity.

You don't count future growth because that is speculative analysis, because it is something that you can only speculate, and it is (for the most part) irrelevant if you are a value investor, because value investors don't speculate on future growth, that's growth investing, the complete opposite of value lmao."

2021-06-10 09:11:47,stocks,"I started buying there before the analysis that the stock was heavily shorted was even done. The price was exactly MSRP and at the time it was either buy it physically in a store if you can find it, or pay 3x as much online from scalpers that bought dozens of copies at a time when Nintendo was having production issues with Ring Fit. And at no point in my comment did I say I trade in games. I haven't traded in any games at any store since about 2012."
2021-06-09 20:04:16,stocks,Yeah I also sold today. Not every dip is because of shorting. People also sell.
2021-06-09 20:03:14,stocks,Doesn't matter. Almost always after earnings there's a sell off. If earnings are good then it may bounce back but there's still that sell off most of the time.

2021-06-10 02:26:03,stocks,I believe it had to do with the MACD; moving average convergence/divergence. GME had a bullish MACD cross the same day RC posted the McDonald’s ice cream tweet.

We also thought he was merging with Super League Gaming as the current CEO worked for McDonald's and Frog before she worked there. But regardless, that wasn't what boosted the price.

2021-06-10 01:55:18,stocks,"Well that's the problem. GameStop has by no means great fundamentals, but they are improving and improving very quickly. In January this was a company hemorrhaging money quarterly and any pivot was being choked by high debt levels and a dying business model that has tied up a lot of assets. This was following much of the faults that prevented blockbuster from pivoting. Since then the company has slowed the operational cashflow bleed, paid off all debt, and garnered 700m? In cash/equivalents. They are absolutely capable of a pivot now. Plus the NFT use case for used digital games could be a very interesting play. So the fundamentals are not great but are improving, at the end of the day this company is still bleeding money from operations. There are 4,000+ companies available on the market, I can find 10 that are actually profitable and trade at a much more reasonable valuation.

That's exactly where you lose people, it's the ridiculous valuation. Let's look at it's 21 billion dollar market cap. I'd much rather own TTWO over GameStop. The company consistently managed to grow earnings, also has no debt, and has established itself as one of the most prestigious game studios on the market.

But with all of that being said here I am with hundreds of GameStop shares. Something is clearly wrong with the data surrounding GameStop. I have no doubt that this is a very unique situation at a scale that hasn't been seen before. I get why people don't like GameStop, it makes sense. But there is something going on here that's worth looking into."

I've been holding Gamestop since 2019 and I recently came across SA comments I made more than a year ago saying that overshorting the float was a dumb idea. If only I had been a little more arrogant I would've made an unfathomable amount of money (I made out decently well as it went anyway).

I was merely commenting about something I noticed recently outside of investing and saying it gave me some suspicions about hedge funds having covered.

&#x200B;

Also, I think that GME is a good play over time, no squeeze needed. There is no reason Chewy should have a higher market cap than GME in my opinion, but it's market cap is still nearly twice GME's. Also, with the unreal amount of stubborn retail holders there COULD be a short squeeze with 20% SI; that's about what short interest was when VW squeezed."

2021-06-09 22:23:21,stocks,"> They have more than just games

That's true but games and hardware is still about 95% of their revenue last I checked (its been a year or two).

As for the P/E, they'd need to have a positive one before we can use that measure. They aren't there yet. A good comparison though is BBY. Direct competitor, though not specialized. Also moving quite a bit to online sales. 7x the revenue of GME in 2020, net profit of 1.8B vs a loss of 200M for GME. BBY has a market cap of 28.8B, GME 21.4B pre-dilution."

A company like GameStop moves based on technical analysis. You're seeing crazy price movements generated by a surge of individuals outbidding one another which blows the price right up. Apple is less likely to be impacted by technical analysis because of the amount of float available.  It's why MSFT, FB, and other distinguished companies are less volatile during the long run. Their fundamentals are simply very sound. You're asking a quite vague question in regards to what the 'fundamental price' of a stock is. What you mean to ask is what is the fair value. There's a ton of factors that go into what the fair value of a company is. You have to compare them against their competitors, market trends, the economy, government intervention regarding rates such as inflation, etc., Do you think Apple is more appropriately priced than GameStop? I don't generally compare P/E or book value of companies that operate in separate sectors but Apple's P/E is decent in the industries they operate in. GameStop has been LOSING money for many earnings period so they don't even have a P/E to show for it.

You're looking at it from the wrong way and I don't know if it's due to a lack of knowledge but fundamentals doesn't dictate the stock price over the short term. It's simply a method to evaluate a company's fair value and then millions of investors bid on the pricing the way they see fit. Right now, no one is buying GME and bidding $300+ because of their 'amazing' fundamentals. They are doing it because of other reasons NOT related to fundamentals."
2021-06-10 13:02:04,stocks,So is Tesla and what is their P/E ratio? And their stock doesn't have as much demand as GME...
2021-06-09 23:07:05,stocks,"Wrong. At that price the fundamentals are gone and it’s purely about the squeeze. Many believe (self included) that retail owns the float, naked shorts need to cover, and we can name our price, which will be way over $1000. 

I do think the fundamentals of the company have done a complete 180 since RC took over though and the future is bright."

2021-06-09 21:13:37,stocks,"Sure, I disagree but let’s just say that’s true. That still makes it a growth play not a value one. Value plays are based on what the company’s current fundamental are right now, and determining intrinsic value. These are typically well established companies that have always been in a certain space and you’re basing them on their current intrinsic value. An example of a value stock would be Berkshire Hathaway, JP Morgan, and Verizon. What you’re basing GameStop on right now is their future prospects, and you’re not basing your valuation on who they are now, making them a growth play. Apple and Microsoft back then were absolutely growth plays, because their valuations were based on how high their future growth would possibly be. Calling GameStop a value play is just straight up wrong"

Yeah, stocks have gone to go back up again after going down. That's literally what they all do. I haven't seen any that are a straight line, so that's a non-argument, don't come trying to counter with that one. Again, shows how inexperienced they are.

The fact is that they attribute the ""has anything changed?"" mindset to the wrong concept. It's not because a stock goes down that you should sell. If nothing else changed, it might be a even a better buy now. But that doesn't mean you haven't lost in net worth.

In every real sense except for taxes (and even then: ask companies), if a stock goes down 10% you've lost 10% of its value, if you sold or not.

If you don't believe me, try going to a bank and getting a loan with that stock as collateral, and explaining how you bought it for a 10% higher value but haven't sold so it's not like you lost it. They will laugh in their face.

What something is worth is exactly what somebody else will give for it. Not what you paid for it.

I also hear rumors of wanting to compete with Amazon. It takes some balls to attempt that but I think that's an impossible task at this point given the size and infrastructure of Amazon.

I mean, power to them at Gamestop and I wish them the best. I don't want to see them fail and go out of business but I just don't have any confidence in them to invest at this price point. If we were talking $20 a share I'd take the gamble but no way in hell would I invest at it's current price."

All stocks trade based on price speculation, because people disagree about what the “fair” or “fundamental” value of a stock actually is at any given time, and more importantly, only really care about what that price will be in the FUTURE. (Because that’s when the “value” can be realized by selling to others.)

I reject your dichotomy of stocks trading either based on “fundamentals” or “technical analysis.” Furthermore, if you aren’t comparing book value / balance sheets etc, then I don’t think you should even use the term “fundamental value,” because that’s what the term refers to - assets v liabilities v revenue, etc. That is to say: quantifiable financial metrics, not a feeling that one has about a company they like having “good fundamentals” meaning a “good” business model.

I disagree with you about GME but don’t have the time to reiterate months of DD here. I will just point out the most famous GME investor in the world is called Deep Fucking Value and if you go watch his YouTube videos or listen to anything he says, you’ll know that he disagrees with you as well. For him, GME was always a value play, that’s why he got in - because it’s price was BELOW fair value. And still is. 🤤"

The few companies that could fight it went to a long legal battle (as overstock did) that ended up in a settlement. Finra and sec only impose cheap (to them) fines if wrongdoing is proven.

2021-06-09 21:16:38,stocks,"Calling us inexperienced... classic shill line. My common sense tells me not to engage further but I do wonder: Does experience really guarantee success? Look at the hedge funds that are shorting GME. Look at what their ‘experience’ has got them. Tens of billions in losses have been reported to the media. Who knows how much they have really lost....

Yes some people buying a stock on momentum will buy at a peak. I myself bought GME during the run up in late January for a price that was higher than it is currently trading now. I also bought it long before that.   If it wasn’t for certain players halting the buying of stocks, the price would have gone much much higher (lest we forget). 

Buying at the peak is the risk momentum traders take on for themselves. But if one truly believes in the company behind the stock, then why not buy more shares when the price drops so as to average down? If you believe the company is capable of a turnaround into an e-commerce venture, into a market that has significant potential, then would averaging down not be a good play? Anecdotally, it certainly has been for me.

It’s the same with Tesla. It’s current market value makes it the most valuable car company in the world. And the reasoning behind it? “Well one day it might have all the things in place to make it the biggest car company in the world” 

I feel like I’m going crazy sometimes. Like why are so many people willing to pay end game prices for something that’s not at the end game? “I bought at X because if everything goes right then one day the stock will be worth X.” WELL THEN WHY ARE YOU OKAY WITH PAYING X FOR IT NOW???"

Once the squeeze is over, people who love the fundamentals of the company will be still in with a % of their original shares or buy back in to support the vision of the future. 

I don’t want to be one of the constant stream of people yelling at others to go to Superstonk. But there is a very strong case in the DD there. I’ve been in since January and I don’t consider myself stupid. I’m sure lots of stupid people say that though lol.

2021-06-10 14:21:57,stocks,Share price is based off of the company value as a whole. Total shares outstanding x current price = market cap. Market cap is the value of the company. GameStop is nowhere close to Apple. You are missing the shares outstanding part of the equation.

I can zoom in and read the majority of those tickers (or just look up which ETFs contain $GME) and then verify if each one was shorted and if the chart is accurate.

Anyone in ""stocks"" or ""investing"" not able to see the blatant price suppression and manipulation almost just from the price action alone, is *WILLFULLY* blind to it.

I've gone into one locally when bored and bought some stuff, but it's definitely not my first stop for anything gaming related. 

It's so bizarre reading these threads with people who are so gung ho about a company that memed its way to the moon but still has nothing going on for it in its target market. They could definitely change things up and re-brand completely as something new, but as a primary business to go to for gaming needs? Hell no. There are so many better alternatives that are quicker, cheaper, and overall just more convenient for people who actually game.

3. “limited edition skin that can be transferred between all blizzard games” this isn’t magic, it’s just cloud sourced data storage/sharing.

4. NFTs don’t store anything on the blockchain, it’s just a link to the image/gif, I could just share the link with any friend and they would have access to the NFT. 

5. The US has refused to recognize digital first sale doctrines, ie. under copyright law, there is no such thing as a unique digital media asset that can be bought and sold on a secondary market, because media files are essentially treated as fungible.

Meanwhile, you're over here talking about net worths and loan prospects like these are things these people even have to put at risk. What's more, tons of those that \*do\* have those are just as pissed off, and able to gauge their own risk at how much they want to express that financially.

Will there be some bagholders? Of course, it's a fundamental attribute of the stock market in any circumstance, why would this be different?

Of course they would, but think about what you just implied. A hedge fund has multiple short positions on multiple stocks. They get margin called to cover their GME position... why would they buy to cover all their other positions at the same time."

That’s a reason to stay out of it, not get in it lol. The only things that spike 1600% like that are speculative bubbles, and entering those is just gambling that you can time it just right so some other sap is left holding the bag. By the time it’s up that 1600%, you missed the boat."

There are plenty of posts in /r/investing and others about how if you miss out on the biggest market days, which happen after a crash typically, your overall returns are much lower. So keep a balanced portfolio, so that if it does dip you can rebalance. I usually will use the 200 day moving average as my get out point for some stocks."

2021-06-10 13:05:16,stocks,This mindset is ..... so bad. People wanting to eat a full crash head on really need to learn to protect their gains. So you have way more buying power on the dip. Ofc only do it when you are convinced its gonna tank short term.

2021-06-09 22:53:28,stocks,If I may ask how much is this portfolio worth?  Would get a better sense of the number of positions IMO.  I tend to like small number of positions depending on funds so you aren't cutting yourself too short
2021-06-09 23:44:18,stocks,"I'm not heavy on Ford or any cars/transportation. I get they're trying to get into automated cars, but we are years away from doing that. There's a reason why TSLA failed its automated cars launch. If you still want to jump in on the hype, I'd recommend Luminar (LAZR). They make lidar tech, which is used for automated cars. It trades at $24 right now, and it recently poached executives from TESLA and INTEL. So it's high-risk, low reward imo. 

I'm against Disney, but that's your choice. You don't have any dividend plays other than VISA. You could consider JPM, MSFT, IBM.   


I like OKTA, it's a pretty long term hold. AirBNB, fire sale right now. XPEV is a good choice and alternate to Tesla. AMAZON, I really find it hard to believe it can get to 4k. I'd rather take a chance on GOOG, MFST, AAPL, or even NVDIA."

2021-06-10 01:15:58,stocks,Good points. My take is they both have room to grow following major dips in price (TDOC a staggering 51%). I’m also betting on people/companies not wanting to change their interface even if TDOC isn’t the best.
2021-06-10 08:37:47,stocks,"Good on you!  Way to be, yeah this is fine then.  Typically I would say have 2/3 stocks, but the companies you have are all fine companies.  Only one I don't know about it XPENG.   

If I were you, I would break down that 500 each month or however you may be doing it and divvying the money up across all the stocks you own to those percentages.

Also, be weary of capital gains tax, don't keep selling over and over and over as you will get killed on taxes (made that mistake my first new year).  So now I've become a long term investor - 5+ years on all stocks I buy as I am only 28 so gunna see how that works out in the long run"
2021-06-10 00:08:27,stocks,"I'm not big on companies where creating streamable content is their primary source of revenue.  DISNEY owns HULU and ESPN, so DISNEY has more content than before. That being said, it's also competing with various streaming services like Netflix, HBO Go, Paramount +, Peacock, etc.   


The battle isn't who can create the next efficient streaming service, its who can create the next hit show/content to retain users. That's a risky business model, imo.  But if you're a huge fan of Disney and consistently buy their merchandise yearly (maybe you have younger siblings/kids), I can see why you would invest in it. Maybe DISNEY will be better in the future now with theme parks and cruises slowly opening up.  


Companies like AMAZON, MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL have various different products/sources of revenue. Hence they are safer bets to take on. As far as entry point, I honestly don't know. A general rule of thumb is to look at Zacks rankings (see if it's a buy signal), and see how the price changed for the current week. If it popped unexpectedly, wait a day or so to see if the price comes down or stabilizes. If it dipped unexpectedly, wait a day or so to see if the price stabilizes.   


Instead of buying 100 shares of apple at once, you can dollar cost average and buy like 20 shares per week for 5 weeks. so you can get them at different prices."
2021-06-10 12:17:19,stocks,"That's a fair point. If I'm with TDOC, I wouldn't change unless I found an absolute and superior UI. [Doxy.me](https://Doxy.me) has a simple ui and gets the job done. TDOC might have more features.

The dip could most likely be investors panicking that all profitable stocks in COVID may not sustain their growth. So TDOC could be a good long term play as long as the business is sound.  


Curious, do you have data on how Teledoc clients are spending on a year to year basis? I know Fastly clients spend 39-47% more on a yearly basis, so Fastly has an excellent model when it comes to retaining/profiting off their existing clients. It's why I'm willing to bet on that, even though the stock is doing pretty bad at the moment."
2021-06-10 11:39:45,stocks,"Thanks for the advice! And yes! I am 24 and I’ve put myself the “challenge” on putting a little bit of money each month and DCA into stocks, etfs, even crypto, and leave it there for 20-30 years (or till I need the money) so actually spliting the 500 into different months sounds like a good idea. Now, there has been rumors of a bubble burst due to the massive print of money during covid. However, due to covid I saw a huge drop in a lot of companies and I thought it was probably a good time to enter the market. What are your opinions? Will the market recover? Are you bullish right now? Or do you think that the market will crash?

One more thing, I suggest you read into XPENG, its a great alternative to Tesla and although it isn’t a “tesla killer” different price forecasts put the stock in a better position 12 months from now. Might be worth the look.

No prob, just be sure to do your research and see if it's something you want to invest in as well. Some of us have invested for years and can still be wrong."
2021-06-09 20:37:02,stocks,You need to diversity into funds and ETFs if you want a safer portfolio. Stocks are great and all but shouldn’t make up the majority of your investments (unless you’re okay with the risk).

What I can say is that XPEV is breaking records year after year with a 400+% growth last year and is doing smart EVs with a lot of innovative tech.

2021-06-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Investing in psychedelics: a revolution in psychiatric medicine and mental healthcare I have for you folks today a closer look at an entirely overlooked sector on the verge of breakout. These medicines possess the potential to address a \~$100 billion mental health treatment  market,   including treatment of previously incurable disorders such as  cluster   headaches, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Traumatic Brain Injuries. How many people do you know suffer  from anxiety,   depression, and addiction? How many people do you know  who are addicted   to opiates, or popping SSRI's and benzos like candy  to deal with their   problems? There is a better way.

Anyone    who has used psychedelic substances knows of their potential.    Personally, I attribute Psilocybin with helping me to end 5 years of    poly drug abuse in 2009 after a single trip. I've been 99.9% sober for    the past 12 years. Sitting to my left is my beautiful newborn daughter    Aurora, something that I previously would have never thought possible.    Meanwhile nearly 20 of my classmates and friends are dead in the wake  of   the opioid epidemic.

Underground medical psychedelic use is exploding in popularity. Look at communities such as [r/microdosing](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/) which have sustained steady growth ([https://subredditstats.com/r/microdosing](https://subredditstats.com/r/microdosing)) and interest in the past few  years.   More studies need to be completed on microdosing in particular,  but  the  anecdotal results look promising.

I    see people comparing this industry to Cannabis, which I don't believe is accurate. The majority of the Cannabis industry is focused on    recreational use, and Cannabis is a single plant, albeit with many    active compounds. Psychedelic medicine encompasses far more molecules,    which are objectively more powerful psychoactives, and have far greater potential for medical application.

These    stocks have been battered like most growth stocks have. But in my    opinion they represent the biggest investment opportunity of this entire    generation. Not just potential for insane returns, but also the potential    to revolutionize psychiatric medicine and how we approach mental  health   as a society. These molecules have incredible characteristics  as   empathogens (empathy promoting), promoting neural plasticity ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6149016/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6149016/)) and even promoting neurogenesis (regrowth of neurons in the brain ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082376/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082376/))).

Not    only is the science elucidating innumerable anecdotal reports of their benefits,   the sector is looking at upcoming major catalysts as more and more  positive   mainstream media press rolls in, and decriminalization  efforts sweep the   nation unbeknownst to many.

* Global    mental illnesses are reaching all-time highs, and were only   exacerbated  by the pandemic. These include anxiety, depression,   addiction, PTSD,  and more.
* ATAI,    the world's largest psychedelics company by market cap, is set to IPO    imminently. When Compass Pathways, the 2nd largest psychedelics  company   IPO'd last year, the sector rallied tremendously in tandem.
* MAPS'    Phase III clinical trial using MDMA to treat PTSD will likely achieve    FDA approval by 2023 at the latest, and will be available to be    implemented at existing psychedelic clinic infrastructure. Their    previous Phase III trial was published in the prestigious Nature    Medicine medical journal and showed astounding results, permanently    curing 68% of the non-placebo group of their official PTSD diagnoses: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3)
* Compass    Pathways is currently running the world's largest study on Psilocybin    to date, in a Phase IIa trial for treatment resistant depression.    Results are expected before the end of 2021. It's basically a near given    that these treatments are both safe and effective (See below  studies).   Imagine knowing a clinical trial's outcome before it's even    completed...that's what we have here.
* Meanwhile, independent studies are already proving Psilocybin's efficacy for treating depression: [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/219413/magic-mushroom-compound-performs-well-antidepressant/](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/219413/magic-mushroom-compound-performs-well-antidepressant/)
* [https://microdose.buzz/new-hopkins-study-finds-psilocybin-4x-more-effective-than-ssri/](https://microdose.buzz/new-hopkins-study-finds-psilocybin-4x-more-effective-than-ssri/)
* Clinics    are already producing revenue via legal Ketamine therapy. How many    people do you know that are aware of this? Some which I can't name are    even producing significant revenue. These companies are building the    infrastructure now that will deliver legal MDMA and Psilocybin therapy.    And they will be doing it before people even realize it's happening,  as   with Ketamine.
* Many    psychedelic reform bills are garnering bipartisan support.   Specifically  MAPS' MDMA for PTSD treatment because it has massive   support coming  from veterans with PTSD. Republicans and Democrats alike   agree on  reducing suffering for veterans. Foundations like VETS ([https://vetsolutions.org/work/](https://vetsolutions.org/work/)) are pushing HARD for this.
* Many    of these companies have been recently financed and are sitting    comfortably on millions of dollars in cash positions. They will be able    to weather a financial downturn. And if inflation proves transitory  and   interest rates continue to remain low, growth stocks will once  again  see  massive tailwinds.

Ultimately,    science is proving what underground users already know: psychedelic    medicine is safe and effective and more often than not it works with    miraculous results. Pitch me a more noble and simultaneously lucrative    cause than this. I believe so strongly in the future of psychedelic    medicine that I'm pretty much all-in on a diversified basket of these    companies. Investing in psychedelics now will get you a front row seat    to the festivities as decriminalization efforts sweep the nation and  the   world, and research results continue to be massively positive.    Meanwhile investors are sleeping on this industry.

Love you all. Good luck and godspeed."

Yes, there are risks as with any medicine. These can mitigated with genetic testing and pre-screening out patients with family history of psychosis. However in my opinion the benefits greatly outweigh the risks. Especially as orphan drugs for indications with no current effective treatment like TBI. And for life threatening disorders such as suicidal ideation and PTSD, I think most sufferers would assume any level of risk to remediate their debilitating symptoms."

2021-06-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Workiva $WK is an overlooked company with little competition in a niche market. Hi everyone - long time lurker but first time posting here cause I want to share with you my take on Workiva ($WK) both from an investor standpoint and someone who currently uses the software for my company's reporting needs.  I'll split this post up into 2 parts with Part 1 being the information about the company, recent earnings, etc. (i.e. a regular DD post) and Part 2 being my experience using this software.  TL;DR at the bottom.

**Part 1 -** Stock price as of typing this is $97.34

Workiva is the end-to-end platform that allows you to integrate financial data, nonfinancial data, and XBRL® tagging. Collect, assemble, and report with the same technology used by more than 3,700 organizations across 180+ countries.  Workiva is essentially specializes in handling companies different reporting, filing, audit, and/or general accounting needs (private, public, regulatory/environmental etc.).  They have a cloud based platform called WDesk that is used to centralize all of the companies financial data and funnel it into their financial statements, reports, footnotes, and other schedules automatically.  A lot of the use case for their platform comes from a companies reporting needs (10-Q/10-K) but other organizations use their platform (including my own) for internal management reporting, budget tracking, financial data analysis, automatic schedule reconciliations etc.

Here is a snapshot from their Q1 2021 10-Q.

* Increased Q1 2021 Subscription & Support Revenue by 24.2% over Q1 2020
* Generated Total Q1 2021 Revenue of $104.2 Million, up 21.5% over Q1 2020
* Achieved 48% YOY Growth of Customers with Annual Contract Value Over $150K
* Expands Total Addressable Market with Launch of ESG Solution
* Raises Full-Year 2021 Revenue Guidance

Workiva also touts an impressive 95% revenue retention rate amongst existing subscribers and a roughly 6% YoY increase in subscribers in 2020.  With the low subscriber churn, subscriber growth, and low operating cost of the WDesk platform this generates great earnings growth each quarter.  Workiva also provides on-demand customer support for all subscribers for any and all questions (used it myself, they're actually great people).  Workiva generates consistent operating cash flow each quarter and is reinvesting it into growing their subscriber base, expanding the WDesk platform, and breaking into new markets.  This is a company with a clear vision and goal in mind and they have been consistently delivering.

**Part 2**

My Background - I'm a former Big 4 auditor that moved into a startup Natural Gas company exactly 1 year ago to transition into a Senior Accountant of Financial Reporting job title.  I have about 4 years experience in auditing both public and private companies and now 1 year with a speciality in FRP.

When I transitioned to my new company the first day they introduced me to this platform that I never heard of called ""WDesk"" that they used for their Quarterly and Annual financial statements.  I thought learning this new software would be tricky but it is honestly one of the most user friendly platforms I have ever used in my short career.  It is basically an excel file online that can link numbers&text straight to a document for reporting.  So if you alter a number in the excel file on WDesk - the financial statements are automatically updated via the link.  When I started we essentially would download our financial data from our GL and key in the financial data manually to the excel file and then boom your report is populated.  Pretty nifty eh?

Well a lot has changed over the year that i've been here.  With the help of the Workiva team on customer support I have basically automated our entire reporting process (still room to go) so that all you need to do is download a BS or IS from the GL and import it into WDesk and all of the fields automatically populate with the correct financial information.  We started only using this for our quarterly and annual reports but now we take it a step further and use it for monthly budget vs. actual reports, monthly/quarterly management reports, monthly account reconciliations you name it.  Everything is quick and easy with this WDesk platform and it actually cut down our reporting process by a full 4 days (Which doesn't seem like a lot but that is a massive time/money save).  We are continuing to expand our WDesk capabilities everyday and as i'm speaking to you now I am currently working on building out new monthly reports.  Anytime I have a question, we have a dedicated Workiva rep that is familiar with our portfolio that assists us with any need.

Furthermore, Workiva has a function built into SAP called ""WData"" that allows companies to skip a step in downloading the financial data from the GL.  Instead, you just sync your GL with WDesk and all of the financial information you need for any specific period will automatically be populated into your spreadsheets and financial statements.  We don't use this yet since we actually just transferred to SAP from Netsuite but this will be coming down the pipeline for us.  Additionally, since we are a LNG company we also are beginning to report to the Federal Environmental Regulatory Agency (FERC) which is a whole new ball game in terms of what financial data needs to be reported, when, what format, document structure etc.  Well fuck me gentleman WDesk built out a specific platform for reporting to this specific regulatory agency and we're expanding our subscription to meet that need.  I can truely see first hand how Workiva is investing in their product and expanding the capabilities and its only been a year.

As an investor, the growth potential and management vision seems extremely promising.  They have partnered with 3/4 of the Big 4 and work with something like 70% of the top fortune 500 companies.  The Company continues to invest in their product and expand their reach in this niche market in an attempt to grab a large market share of this industry.

As a user, I absolutely love this platform.  It makes my job so easy, makes me look good, and gives me time during work to write this lmao.  My major client in my auditing days would key in everything manually every time the books were closed or their was an update which would take days.  With WDesk this takes minutes.  The platform is extremely user friendly allowing for companies to easily adopt this platform with little disruption in the day to day.  

TL;DR - Workiva is a fast growing business in a niche industry of financial reporting/accounting.  They have consistent increases in their EPS, CF, subscribers, and revenue each quarter and reinvest profits into their business model which, as a user myself, I see first hand and it makes my job so much easier.

Positions - I own 30 shares as of this morning when I executed my purchase.  I wish I knew this company was public sooner but I will be a long term investor in this one."

I wonder if this isn't being raised as something I've seen before: the common holy war posturing that pits FSLY against NET.  I don't subscribe to that.  I've owned them both and liked them both.  

As for portraying Fastly as someone willing to give away service to anyone, their own rather low customer count disproves that.  They may not be profitable, but their customer mix is a strategic choice.  And as a recent outage shows, many of the Internet kings do rely on them exclusively, and those ones absolutely could not ""switch CDNs in 10 minutes."""

2021-06-10 00:00:39,stocks,"Out of curiosity, what makes Fastly’s compute on edge significant or different?

Cloudflare already has their Workers runtime in production with wide availability with known customers. AWS Lambda at Edge is also available. Last time I checked, Fastly is still in limited availability with a fair number of restrictions (more than the other 2 and solely supporting WASM). I hope for the best since many of their WASM runtime team are (former) Rust community/Mozilla employees but their compute at edge stack seems to be a bit behind right now."

It's not easy to just ""buy"" expertise in an area, and security itself is probably one of the hardest. Security for a CDN isn't just a product, it's an entire ethos for designing all of your products and something that is as important on day one of a new product as it is at launch.

I don't think you can just ""buy security company <ba da bing> our product is now secure!""

It's also about convincing institutional customers that you are secure. ""Our in-house security philosophy has driven every product, change and decision for years"" plays better to the big spenders than ""Yo we used our VC to buy this sweet security company so, We Know Cyber now!"""

With many states getting legalization rolling out this year, and the inevitable national legalization coming within the next decade the green rush is coming.  

Most of these companies have established grow operations / retail dispensaries.

1. Curaleaf in NJ is a medical dispensary with outrageous pricing... but come legalization that should change.  They have extremely high quality products though, especially when it comes to edibles.
2. JUSHI is doing big things and expanding their footprint in the US.  NY and NJ legalization can play a big role especially if Pennsylvania follows suit.
3. Tillray, I'm still looking into.
4. PLNF is really like their Vegas dispensary.  If they dabble more into the growing their own in house cannabis with flagship stores across the US.  I think they can be a force to reckon with in the next 2/3 years.

Questions about physical stock certificates appear in this forum regularly.  Has your family hired an attorney to advise the executor of your father-in-law's estate?  If yes, then the attorney is your best source of information.  In any event, the certificates need to be handed over to the executor.

It is likely that some or all of those stock certificates are live shares worth real money.  Up until about 20 years ago most companies were still issuing certificates.

Since child care is the core business of Bright Horizons, I’d think that people would want to buy this given the infrastructure proposal on the table. 

I know the Bright Horizons stock has taken a hit because more workers have been at home so revenue for child care services has been down. In addition, there’s still many centers closed due to Covid. At this point, I’d imagine revenue  increasing in the coming quarters as the US economy opens up.

At 63, it has a dividend yield of 3.2% and it's running at $2.05 a year. If I'm doing the math right, selling the stock is basically taking 10 years of dividends in one swoop.

To which I see in June of 2016 the price of AAPL was averaging around $23. I tell myself that ""something seems off"". I seem to remember Apple stock trading for much higher back then.

So I look at archived posts, photos, YouTube videos, and Reddit posts (like this one [https://imgur.com/a/XbRFH](https://imgur.com/a/XbRFH)) regarding AAPL in 2016. And low and behold, AAPL was trading at above $90 in 2016 according to all of these references.

2021-06-10 00:00:00,stocks,"How to take the next step in trading/investing? I am relatively new investor, I have been doing my own research for about  year now. I have a Vanguard account that I have almost all of my saving in. I am perfectly fine with keeping 80-90% of my savings in this account and am fine with the returns its producing. 

However this past month I have been accepted to a graduate program where I will be attempting to get my Masters of Finance. With a focus on Financial Analysis. For the past 6 months or so I have been using a play around account that I deposited 5k into. The problem is that the stuff I have been investing in has been either a flop (ARKW) or there is not enough risk for me to make any worthwhile gains. 

What should I be looking to do with this play around account. Currently I feel invested into way too many dividend stocks and stuff that will make me money if I hold the stock for life, but I doubt I will be doing that as the returns will end up being too small.

What is the first step too branching out into more risky plays (not Meme stocks)?

Currently my positions are:

VZ $57.50 calls 1/22/22

AMD $92.50 calls 6/17/22

UNFI $60 calls 1/20/23

LMT (+5%)

MO (+3%)

MSFT (+4%)

PENN (-17%)

2021-06-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Exxon, Suncor and Devon WTI crude has hit $70 a barrel today and Brent has been holding above the $70-71 range for a bit over a week now. I think that this is the beginning of a new leg up in oil stocks and oil prices. 

I have been skeptical of Exxon in the past and I almost sold out of my position entirely in may after it reaches its 52 week high. I have since averaged back in because although I do not agree with the board shakeups, I do believe market sentiment will be better with the new members. My first thesis on exxon was that I respected it for NOT being a green energy play when all the hype was going towards green energy. I do not expect this to change with the new members, I think they will remain heavily invested in oil and carbon capture opportunities for the foreseeable future, making it a great play for higher oil prices.

Suncor is just a great company, they are one of the only companies to produce jet fuel for Canada and I think as covid bears an end this company will see many, many tailwinds. Just from basic understanding of the company you can tell that Suncor doesn't really rely on high oil prices to be profitable as well, this is just a smart play all around as they also have pledged to become net zero on emissions and people enjoy the green commitments. 

Devon I enjoy because of their dividend structure and sound balance sheet. I hold Devon mainly because of market sentiment and I like their synergies across the company. I think the run to $30 is sustainable, although the past week it has seen consolidation and even underperformance although oil prices continue to climb. I think it's currently a good time to average up, but I would be weary of starting an entirely new position if you do not have a good cost average already. I do believe it has room to run overall, though.

I am playing this in a bit of a strange way compared to my usual swing trading strategies. I'm top of shares, I am buying exxon calls for mid July at $60 and $65 strikes. Devon and Suncor have low OI and volume on most calls I would consider attractive, which makes me stick with only shares on these companies. 

I am heavily invested in this thesis and I believe it can peak this year, and potentially go into next year. Higher oil prices will also allow these companies to pay off debt at a faster rate than previously which also can make a compelling long thesis for some of these companies. This is a swing trade for me, but I plan on holding for 6 months to a year, and I will take my profits at a set price and reevaluate the position to see if anything has fundamentally changed to make me keep a portion of my position for the long. Right now, I plan on exiting my position once my price target is reached, or selling for a loss if the thesis is wrong. 

I'm not into ETFs, but I've seen good ways to play this is the OIH and XLE. Purchasing calls and shares will probably do well, I simply prefer these companies and only want exposure to them."

2021-06-09 21:37:12,stocks,"Perhaps you are right, maybe I should read into it more and research some of the new seats.

Wholefoods makes perfect sense too. There are two important parts to this. 1st, this allowed to them to expand to grocery more easily and quickly. 2nd, they need real estate especially in urban centers.

I know they have warehouses but those arent always in urban centers. Why is that important? Last mile delivery and eV's or drones. Amazon wants to bring shipping in house and rightly so. Its expensive. These urban located properties puts them in close enough range of delivery to use things like short range automated drones and gives drivers a nearby place to fast charge on company owned solar to save a ton on fuel/energy.

Their moves do make sense. They are obviously trying to go vertical and become more of a diverse conglomerate, similar in ways to Berkshire. Oh by they way, they also have a big investment in eV's via Rivian."

I’ve read some say you should look at future guidance for the next years EPS Growth estimates. If you’re looking at guidance on EPS Growth, would you then look at guidance on PE ratio too?

Example: people have been hearing about inflation since the first stimulus checks were printed - people would have prepared for the inflation, right? Worst case scenario tomorrow is the CPI is a few percentage points higher than expected and we start to see a tapering drop in the market, not an immediate sell off. If the CPI is a few points under the expectation then we get a green day because people would have already priced in the predicted percentage. Again, correct me if I’m wrong on that thought. Obviously, no one knows what’ll happen."

If my stock price goes down to $5 next week, the option expires worthless but I get the $10 premium and I still keep my stocks even thougj the price got halved, right?

2021-06-09 21:54:44,stocks,"I'm not in the hyperinflation camp but I don't see how you're going to get a print that's suddenly a massive miss to the downside from what's expected tomorrow. Best case will probably be a number that is close to what's expected, either on the downside or upside. Worst case would be a major beat again and if that case happens, everything's probably going to just get thrown away for a day.

It's undeniable that there's inflation, it's just probably supply chain issues, which is why I'm going to wait on making a judgement here.

I did randomly say earlier this year that I thought that crude would be $80 this summer...which looks like a better call than somebody saying that ""I don't expect crude to ever hit $70 again""."

The fact that CNBC is trying to use year over year comparisons, from a year with zero fucking inflation, is just damnable evidence that they are trying to spook dumb money/retail. Comparison of 2021 to 2019 would be the logical route,  not 2021 to 2020.

Dumbass bears will shut up soon especially when people finally accept the fact that inflation is transitory and that the fed means what they say when they say they aren’t raising rates for a long while.

2021-06-10 00:56:58,stocks,"I think of it this way: The fact that people are wondering *if* it's even priced in illustrates that no one knows for sure how exactly to price it in appropriately. So, no, it's pretty unlikely it's priced in---at least not correctly. That said it's totally fair to assume traders and investors are factoring in expectations for increasing inflation and interest rates to **some** degree, but it's not possible to know what degree is the right one. Some people undoubtedly think that inflation is going to skyrocket, and that the Fed is playing it down. Some people trust the Fed's insistence that inflation may not even be high enough, and even if it turns out to be it would be transient. Consensus is what the market shows and it's why efficient market hypothesis is a thing. But... I forecast for a living, and I'll say this: **The consensus forecast is always wrong to some degree**, because the future is impossible to predict to precision. We won't know what's up with inflation until it happens."

2021-06-09 22:52:12,stocks,You were saying about CLNE eating shits? It's all about the P&D. The apes are pumping it.
2021-06-10 01:44:31,stocks,i got downvoted but i know PTs set by analysts move the stock price often. Go to marketbeat and it will let you know if an analyst’s PT made an impact. They certainly crippled SPWR. 99%? that is hyperbole.

2021-06-10 09:21:35,stocks,I just put some money in CURI and NVTA. I'm hoping to ride them up for a while
2021-06-10 17:49:55,stocks,So I'm a long time viewer lol. Anyways I've been reading into some of surgalines info. Looks like they have been raising alot of money recently and have also teamed up with a AI company. Anyone's else been watching this stock? Any thoughts or helpful info?
2021-06-10 15:05:50,stocks,"Hmmm, lets see, todays drop doesnt look much encouraging."
2021-06-10 10:25:15,stocks,Definitely not - ETFs are  more diversified and actively managed and will add new companies to their holdings if the market shifts. It's a tall task to pick winners and losers in a really really really immature market like US cannabis.
2021-06-10 13:42:51,stocks,"And they appointed a new director with a pretty rich history...

2021-06-10 09:08:55,stocks,That's great he has finally decided to be a spokesperson
2021-06-10 14:54:05,stocks,"Apologies for the late reply, so what would your non financial advise be for finding potential stocks and sectors to look into? 

It’s scary shit, but if you don’t make the risk, how do you want to make money and reap the rewards? (That’s my mindset, be smart and play the game)"
2021-06-09 21:18:40,stocks,As a dentist? Your livelihood and your old relationship with ALGN is in harms way. This company's management also disrupted the optomology sector with 1800 contacts as their first venture. Management and history prove otherwise. I feel bad for you though since you'll make less money as SDC hacks away at the clear aligned market space!
2021-06-10 08:14:52,stocks,BH is making money. AMC are not - in fact their pre covid revenue cant even pay interest on their debt. Its Qanon for retailsellers
2021-06-10 14:51:34,stocks,The VIX benchmark does not decay.. but the VIX Short-Term Futures Index does. So theres decay if your invested in a ETF that tracks that index
2021-06-10 10:13:12,stocks,IRDM will come back up. ARK funds are generally just a bad idea right now. Cathy is being dumb.
