2021-06-26 19:26:13,wallstreetbets,"Hey 👋 I’m the one who wrote the post about being a revenge trader. Thanks for this write up, lots to digest and reflect on."
2021-06-26 19:38:31,wallstreetbets,"This is amazing:

""Gamblers are not addicted to the high they get from winning, they are addicted to the high they get from uncertainty and anticipation.

You get a dopamine hit when the numbers move how you thought they would. You even get a dopamine hit from losing. You do not get a dopamine hit from exiting a position because then the game is Over.

This is why you can't exit gracefully: the 'more' you *think* you are craving has nothing to do with making money, it has to do with seeing the numbers go up."""
2021-06-26 18:34:46,wallstreetbets,"For me, in the beginning, I looked at it more like a video game. The colors and font are very similar.

One thing that helped was looking at everything in terms of percentage. Percentage gained, percentage lost. Then, the overall number didn't matter as long as the percentage made sense. I quit chasing numbers and thresholds and started to make money.

Now, because I eat crayons, I will likely still lose it all. But looking at everything in terms of percentage has at least given me a chance to hold it longer. 😁"
2021-06-26 18:49:09,wallstreetbets,thanks OP. I invest (gamble) on the Australian market and this post helps me realise why I held onto my 150% gains (about $30k) until they went back to 0%.
2021-06-26 19:29:33,wallstreetbets,">	Think about how much money it actually is. Is it a utility bill, your rent/mortgage, a steak dinner, a vacation, a sports car, an early retirement?

This is too emotional. If it’s a trade, we are not investing in this subreddit, you need a plan before you ever get into the trade. Set a take profit target mark and stop loss. Remove all emotion, human algo."
2021-06-26 19:47:15,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand this. You wrote this as if you only ever YOLO on options and always hold till expiration. 

Selling if you wouldn't buy at this price - common sense. If you are up 300%, selling enough to lock in a nice gain - common sense. Not doing that is retarded.

I had 3265 shares of CRSR at basis of 35. The day it recently popped above 40 I sold all but my gain over 40. It kept dropping. Glad I sold."

2021-06-26 19:10:06,wallstreetbets,So... did anyone tell you this isn't AA?
2021-06-26 18:51:51,wallstreetbets,"Ironically for me, the percentages were my worst enemy too. I missed out on selling GME in March for a 100x gain because it was up 38% that day and for some reason I wanted 40% and ""then"" I'd sell. 

Somehow the +10,000% became less relevant even when everything else inside of me should have been screaming to sell especially given what happened in January. But I had no fear and no perspective in the moment. 40% was my next hit.

Given my compromised brain, there's always some arbitrary ""next"" percentage or raw value to anticipate.

What's helped me personally is to focus on total account value and position size and constantly asking ""would you be OK not having this? How much of this are you OK with losing?"" 

Also merely thinking about setting stop losses usually pushes me towards selling since the idea of ""taking less"" with a stop below the current bid makes me feel like I'm getting cheated and outweighs the ""but what if it goes up more"" syndrome by making me focus on what I actually have. For some reason it makes the number ""real"" instead of being just an abstraction."

2021-06-26 19:33:19,wallstreetbets,"I feel bad for him, I'm pretty crazy but I've hit rock bottom at least twice in my 28 years so this is all NG+ to me"
2021-06-26 19:30:56,wallstreetbets,"Tbh that's pretty disheartening to hear. Wasn't fucking with you, I have bpd and ptsd and weed really helps me calm down during manic episodes or when I'm having bad anxiety/panic attacks. If you need to take a break from trading to figure out a way to nuture your mental health when things get bad, then do so. As you now know, your mental condition can become so bad it makes you physically ill. Nothing is more important than your health or your life. Life is long, there will be time to chase your ambitions, but you'll never reach anything if you aren't standing on solid ground"
2021-06-26 19:40:53,wallstreetbets,"$ROPE Isn't just a joke as funny as it seems, like for real homie just needs to rest."
2021-06-26 19:52:26,wallstreetbets,"No worries, thanks for the kind words. I'm getting better slowly and I'm fortunate that all my issues stem from regret over not taking massive gains or giving gains back. 

I am *very* lucky to have somehow still made some good gains and come out ahead without losing any of the money I started with. 

It's all the other big picture stuff surrounding it that became overwhelming and if I'm being honest it was just a catalyst that triggered deeper issues I've had suppressed or held in check my whole life. Giving up six-figures of gains because of ""dumb"" decisions is very hard to deal with if you can't understand how or why it happened...but once I started figuring it out and understood the illness it made it easier even though it was still my own fault."
2021-06-26 19:46:53,wallstreetbets,"Believe me I know, tried and failed when I was 21. Had to spend a couple of weeks in a mental ward. Shit really gets put in perspective when you're with a bunch of other people suffering like you or worse. There was a girl there for having a mental break down until the cops were called, I think she was a prostitute. Young, pretty, pregnant (she found out when she was administered), and addicted to crack. I sat there listening to what her life was like and just thought, ""I can't even imagine how much she's suffered in life, what the fuck am I doing trying to kill myself.""

Once you see that shit in person it's hard to feel sorry for yourself."

2021-06-26 19:30:11,wallstreetbets,If you like the short interest and growth potential there's this other stock that I think you'll absolutely love. Short interest could be in excess of 200% if the number of OTM Puts used to hide the FTD are anything to go by. It's already given the shorts huge bloody broken noses after investors recognised the growth potential + short squeeze potential. They sell Games. Stop me if you've heard about them?

2021-06-26 14:59:57,wallstreetbets,"Biden is tough to track. It's like he wants to get something done then someone smacks his wrist and he apologizes and pulls a 180. 

I think the bill will go nowhere. They will fight over it until the midterms and history usually indicates the minority party becomes the majority so Republicans will get the majority and then the bill will continue to go nowhere."
2021-06-26 15:16:45,wallstreetbets,"I think you raise a valid concern.  Renewable fuel, renewable energy, and EVs all depend on government policy to serve as a catalyst for change in changing our economy to be less fossil fuel dependent.  The problem is that growth in those areas will come at the expense of the largest and most powerful industry in the world:  O&G.

I’m not sure how all of this plays out but Biden isn’t beyond buckling to the O&G lobby.  Take the Renewable Fuel Standard as an example.  Refiners may be getting a reprieve as renewable fuel credit prices have skyrocketed back to 2016 levels in just a few months after a 4 year decline under Trump:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-15/biden-weighs-middle-of-the-road-biofuel-quota-in-nod-to-refiners

Our fossil fuel economy is like a big ship:  It’s not going to turn quickly - especially with republican obstruction.  If you are investing in this stuff near-term (2 years or less) you’re making a gamble.  Over 10 years, those stonks will only go up.  I was invested in albemarle (lithium mining) WAY early and lagged the S&P for years.  Biden got elected and it rocketed up in a few weeks and has since drifted back down.  If you play the long game and invest in companies that are profitable now, you’ll weather the ups and downs."
2021-06-26 14:36:56,wallstreetbets,"Biden has absolutely no clue what he signs or what he says, incase you haven’t figured that out yet."
2021-06-26 17:11:48,wallstreetbets,This actually helps workhorse cause he wants EVs

There’s lots of good reasons to be a democrat, I’m not knocking y’all if u are, but I have very little faith that we’re gunna get through the next year or two without an epic market crash. The feds are terrified right now, they just pushed up their time frame for raising interest rates.

You only read it that way because you have a firm bias.  I simply said they went down when he took over and i expected them to go up.  And yes oil and banks have moved the market way up in the last few months.
2021-06-26 17:26:56,wallstreetbets,It's a standard political play.
2021-06-26 17:25:53,wallstreetbets,"It may delay some of the stocks from taking off but it's just a delay. 

The biggest hurdle I think EV is going to have is when they hit a point where power grids start to suffer. California already has a pretty crap power grid and they are I'll prepared to handle a massive increase from a growing EV market and just like most government they address problems after they happen. 

Imagine a huge EV consumer base that can't actually charge their cars. Other states will likely face similar issues but California already suffers frequent power issues as it is."
2021-06-26 16:45:01,wallstreetbets,"There’s sizable lithium deposits in Nevada and Australia - assuming you are referring to lithium. 

As for rare earth metals:  They aren’t all that rare.  There’s rare earth mining in north central Florida.  The problem is that in the US, there’s a lot of radon and other radioactive material that gets dug up in the mining process and you have to move a lot of material because they’re found in low concentrations compared to other minerals and metals we mine.  This combined with the regulatory requirements results in the supplying coming from overseas.  It is a decision to source from China instead of mining them domestically.  Right or wrong."
2021-06-26 18:48:21,wallstreetbets,Any metal found in China can be found in US or Canada which is an essentialy integrated market. Just need to develop the mines here at home in NA.
2021-06-26 15:57:50,wallstreetbets,"It's hard to say how it will pan out.  On one hand, younger and more progressive voters (read: up and coming backbone of the Democratic Party) clearly want to see fossil fuel subsidies end and clean-tech brought to the market.  On the other hand, there are a lot of moderate Republicans that don't subscribe to the Trump mantra and Biden does not want to alienate them with a closely divided Senate going into mid-terms.

I am keeping a close eye on the RFS and how it plays out.  If Biden folds to O&G over a well established mandate that should have been baked into their operating cost for the past 4 years, I really don't hold out much hope for meaningful energy policy reform."

2021-06-26 18:00:06,wallstreetbets,"He said he wants the other tranche of spending along with the infrastructure bill to be passed through budget reconciliation. If they go that route, they don't need bipartisan support. Market loves it when the government unloads a mountain of cash and there's really nobody that can stop it. I'd lay better-than-even odds that it'll happen, and EV companies will benefit from it. Bullish in the near-term, but the resulting inflation is just going to keep getting worse. Also be prepared for the likely government-shutdown antics in October over the budget, which will also include some phenomenal spending."

2021-06-26 15:19:05,wallstreetbets,"Because the EV money in the current bill is minor compared to what they initially proposed (on mobile rn, but something like 170 billion slashed to like 4 billion). The second reconciliation bill will (likely) have a vastly larger impact on EV manufacturing and infrastructure if it passes, afaik.

So, EV companies want the second bill. All renewables and clean energy want the second bill. The current bill sells off infrastructure to private parties, which will (likely) require tolls to maintain. This treats EVs the same as fossil fuel vehicles w/r/t paying for roads, which is worse than the current arrangement where the gas tax does a lot of heavy lifting. 

Just my opinion."
2021-06-26 16:51:57,wallstreetbets,"Because he never intended to make a compromise that the republicans wanted, his actual desire was to put thumbscrews into Manchin and Sinema. This way if Republicans back out he can claim Republicans won't agree with bipartisanship and start a PR battle."
2021-06-26 18:52:53,wallstreetbets,"This shows a rudimentary understanding of politics and the situation.

Biden wants BOTH. He wants his Bi-Partisan deal so he can appeal to the middle. But if he does that without the accompanying bill then the Progressives can turn around and torpedo the Bi-Partisan bill in the House. AOC at anytime could sink it with the snap of her fingers. But she doesnt want that. None of them do. But that is the barganing chip the left holds right now. SO far you've only heard about the Manchin/Sinema dynamic because the Progressives in the House have played nice and gone along getting very little. That will not fly with Infrastructure. They will make a stand on that considering its capacity to pump a shit ton of cash into their communities via many pipelines. 

Biden has to appease BOTH sides. The way to do this is by pushing his Bi-Partisan bill but not signing it until he gets his OTHER bill on his desk. One that can be created using Reconciliation. This method bypasses the Filibuster and allows Democrats to pass a majority only partisan bill.  

It's a tight rope the administration must walk."
2021-06-26 17:28:56,wallstreetbets,"The bill goes through the legislative houses, gets butchered and watered down by minority rule republicans in the Senate, thanks to the zero effort filibuster, and comes back as a Frankenstein without any of the provisions he wanted. 

So yeah he's gonna send it back.

I’m just pointing out that they’re both mentally unreliable old men and both racist and there are public record videos of both of them doing or saying pedophilic shit.

2021-06-26 16:31:10,wallstreetbets,"OK…

“Lesser of two evils” is better than “Trumpy cult member.”

However, just look at the choice from a Democracy perspective…I believe Biden is light years better than Trump.

Trump is literally a dictator wannabe who’d gladly destroy democracy to stay in power."
2021-06-26 16:33:11,wallstreetbets,I mean yeah he’s a status quo guy and not a far right end of days type of guy. I don’t think status quo politics is gonna serve the people’s interests but I’d love to be proven wrong. Obviously better to have democrats in office but most of the evil shit is still gonna happen unfortunately. For example Democrats love to talk about immigration reforms to hide the fact they’re not actually going to close the concentration camps

It took eight days and countless hours of hold music that absolutely sucks to get a human at square.  Pure shit show, and they’ll never see another dime with my name on it.

2021-06-26 14:36:17,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, thanks for sharing.  Do you have any experience with google pay?"
2021-06-26 16:45:26,wallstreetbets,Square vs. PayPal. They are the same business. PayPal originally took just a tiny fraction of a percentage on Ebay. Ebay took a couple percent on every sale. They seem a little greedy. But they are the best in class. I feel your pain though.
2021-06-26 17:09:49,wallstreetbets,Look into Humblpay. Stock symbol Hmbl. Gonna be big competition in this field

I disagree with OP’s assertion, but we all set our own personal risk tolerances and mine are fairly conservative for this sub. Outside of this sub I look like a risky investor. Context is everything!"
2021-06-26 19:53:15,wallstreetbets,"The way I see it is I buy a stock because I think the price will go up.  If it goes down then I was wrong about it once so I don’t see why I couldn’t be wrong about it again.  Paul Tudor Jones had “Losers average losers” taped above his desk.  I think there’s a big difference between “averaging down” and “scaling in” / adding to a position you’ve already gained on that’s dipped from all time highs.  If it wasn’t part of the plan from the beginning and you still have conviction in your pick just hold it.  Lots of people encourage it because they managed to bail themselves out doing this in the past but I really don’t like it as a strategy, I feel like it’s the same as trying to pick bottoms in a stock.  I learned this lesson the hard way and would never go back to the old ways haha"
2021-06-26 14:52:46,wallstreetbets,The share price can always go lower. I only trade options and they have an expiration date. I've turned a bad trades into worse trades by trying to average down my cost. Managing my position size is the best way for me to manage risk. Buy adding to a losing trade I end up throwing more fuel on the fire.

I keep buying 1,000 shares on what I consider the entry for the day and waiting for this popularity driven price breakout to occur.  If it shoots like a star up to $62/share because it debuted at number 62, that is cool with me, because it will only take me about 62 seconds to cash out with the profits and then 3:01 to move on to the next set up, lol.

"" When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true""

Interesting tho. Maybe worth investigating. If the legalization seems promising. If they are having trouble expanding to more states then hard pass."

2021-06-26 19:39:00,wallstreetbets,Interest piqued.
2021-06-26 17:45:34,wallstreetbets,"I didn't actually buy... I tried to, but I waited too long. I've watched a lot of ""Short and Distort"" attacks from short sellers, where they publicly trash the company and blow a lot of smoke. Investors panic and bail, and they make a quick profit. In many cases, the damage is very short term. I thought it would go down for a few more days so I could buy the dip, but DKNG bounced right back."
2021-06-26 17:53:59,wallstreetbets,"I thought you were saying that it was good that the company is shorted, because that’s not necessarily a good thing mate"
2021-06-26 18:17:38,wallstreetbets,"No, but it's good for investors who buy the shares on sale, though."
2021-06-26 19:11:45,wallstreetbets,"If it bounces back, that is. I think it depends from case to case. If the company is overvalued and therefore shorted, I wouldn’t buy. If a stock is shorted, that’s more often bearish than bullish. Unless of course the stock is shorted on a bad thesis. Either way it’s not something i would factor too much in when investing.

If you expect every shorted stock to squeeze you’re on deep waters"

My win ratio is actually good, I accumulate small wins that start to add up but then I lose weeks of work in a day. When I lose, Oh boy, do I fucking lose. 

Ive concluded my biggest weakness is that I don’t know how take a loss. I classic revenge trade, doubling down, losing more, getting emotional and frustrated and then all logic goes out the window I start throwing money at the most risky options to try to make it back. Sigh. 

I love day trading but maybe it’s just like gambling. Hitting my dopamine when I win… and then I’m thirsty for that same hit…

I’m considering not trading on the minute candle but not quite ready to give up…

And yes, I have a trading rule book. But in the moment it’s fucking thrown out. 

I feel like this sub is going to have people that can relate lol. I’m sure I’ll get some flaming but I look forward to some nuggets of wisdom…"

2021-06-26 12:12:28,wallstreetbets,"When I lose on a trade I thought I would win, before I go to buy more I will ask myself out loud “are you buying more because you believe in the position or buying based on ego & emotion” 9 times out of 10 it’s emotion and I stop myself and move on. Same goes with not selling when I’m up 100% a day after buying a option. I’m constantly thinking out loud and practicing making decisions based on my strategy and logic and not emotion."
2021-06-26 12:25:38,wallstreetbets,"I used to think that I always had to have positions every day when day trading and would end up losing money because I'd buy into something that I was not confident with. Now, I sometimes go two to three days if there is nothing that checks the box for all my rules. Always stick to your rules and try to keep emotion out of it."
2021-06-26 12:39:14,wallstreetbets,"If I ever feel myself getting emotional I close the trade and walk away. No more trading that day. Come back after the market is closed and analyze what went wrong and what I could have done better logically and without beating myself up. There’s always going to be more opportunities, but the only way you’re going to see them is if you protect your capital."
2021-06-26 13:44:14,wallstreetbets,Just remember that your account doesn't care which stock the gains come from. No need to make back what you lost on a particular ticker from the same ticker itself.

If I feel the need to double down now, I’ll do it with shares so I can typically fight another day if I’m wrong. Doubling down on calls, you might as well just hand your money to thetagang"
2021-06-26 12:43:29,wallstreetbets,"Trading above all takes discipline. If you don't have the willpower to walk away then you shouldn't be trading seriously. 

Either find the discipline in yourself or just trade casually with extra funds as a hobby, don't blow your whole load."

2021-06-26 12:02:10,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the clown show 🤡
2021-06-26 12:17:20,wallstreetbets,"I played GME and AMC. At one point, my GME gains were north of 400%, on a 75k investment, so clearly some printing going on. But then I held too long. I bought more when it dipped cuz I fell victim to the OMG1KisComing!  Got in too heavy on margin, got margin called. Ended up with a 60k loss….

AMC, got in at 12, rode to 25 during that PM move, was up 30k, then it started to fall. Sell?  “WTF IS SELL?”  They said…. Held, bought dips, all the way down to $5.50….sold the loss for 120k neg.  Again bought on margin and wagered money I didn’t have and money i needed for other things like a house down payment.

The biggest lesson I gleaned from all of it:  Worrying about missing the launch (missed opportunity) GREATLY OUTWEIGHS losing the already captured gains + loss due to holding too goddamn long.

Do not worry about a missed opportunity. THERE. WILL. BE. MORE. Maybe not this or that stock, but other setups WILL ARISE. Just tell yourself that when you’re up a healthy amount, and when you find you’re happy when looking at your gains, THATS when you sell.  Don’t wait, don’t analyze. Don’t say, “but if…”. Just fucking get out with the win, relish in it, and get ready to play again tomorrow."
2021-06-26 13:24:36,wallstreetbets,"My mum is loose but I feel ya brother.. 

Revenge trading is one of the worst things that can happen to you. I got Covid like 2 months ago, and when I was resting for that 2 weeks, I lost 20k while trying to daytrade. 20k for me is a lot of money. 

I feel like it’s better not to stare at the screen the whole day. Best times to daytrade is when the market opens. IV is pretty high during that time and it’s easy to scalp some profits and run. Just try to control yourself and don’t let emotions get to your head. 

I’m sure a lot of brothers here will help you out. Good luck!"
2021-06-26 13:38:42,wallstreetbets,"Day-trading is essentially the art of paper handing. 

So you gotta think like a paper-hander, live in their shoes, take the losses early, take the profits early, and at the end of the day say: ""damn I may have lost $300 earlier today, but that $60 up looks pretty sweet right now."""

2021-06-26 12:36:23,wallstreetbets,"Only discovered day trading maybe a month and a half ago and can see how this would happen.  My girl goea to the casino and almost every time she has a win, doubles down, to lose it all.

Whew.   And then shes borrowing money from me on her next chexk cause im the saver.  Tough to get ahead in life when your partner isnt there financially, or rather makes money but gives it to the casino usually within days....

I think that if you have a gambling addiction its hard to cut down, and VERY hard to stop that train.

Its silly to suggest that you step away for awhile because thats obviously not happening, so ill just say the others have great advice for you.  Let go of options, small plays for dopamine rushes.

Good luck"
2021-06-26 13:45:05,wallstreetbets,"You should never ever make a trade out of emotion. Instead, learn from your losses. What did you do wrong? What were the signs you ignored? If you are able to limit your losses, you will be ok in the long run. Otherwise, you’re just gonna lose more.

- My personal loss prevention is very strict. For a trade, I will not invest more than 20% of my total funds. And I will stop the bleeding at 10-15% of that. 
Ends up being 4-5% loss from my funds. Instead of going yolo and getting wiped"

I would lose my shit and just start clicking the buy and sell buttons like I was paper trading---except with real money; my record is 157 executions in like two hours. (I'm sure someone on here can beat that by a country mile...) There's a point where you just need to look yourself in the mirror and admit you don't have the emotional stability to do this shit. 

Move on. There's other shit you can do that'll make you gains with a fuckload less stress."

2021-06-26 15:25:29,wallstreetbets,"It is easy to make bad trades from revenge trading, being too tired to trade or out of boredom. When revenge trading or trading while tired you forget things or simple rules like not checking RSI first or doing much research and then you are staring at a 70% loss the next day thinking it would recover (it didn't and usually will not) on weekly options. 

Rules to live by.

1. If you must trade a weekly option hold it no longer than a few hours, don't hold over night and never buy on Monday to hope for a miracle on Friday. 

2. Make sure the stock movement is nearing the end of a trend and buy calls or puts in the correct direction. Check RSI, don't buy puts if it's below 30 and don't buy calls if its above 70. More so if it is a weekly. 

3. Don't trade out of boredom.

4. Be patient, don't fomo, cash is a position too, wait for a good setup to happen with a lot of research behind it. 

5. Take your gains even if it is only 10-20%. Those gains add up over time and are way less risky. 

6. Do not turn a profit into a loss by thinking it will go even higher.

7. Watch out for offerings after a pump on crap penny stocks. 

8. Spy is the easiest stock to option trade if you are a technical trader. If you need to options trade do it on the Spy, stop trading options on crap penny stocks. Spy is almost too predictable with textbook patterns and easier to trade using just the RSI. Why? Because the hive mind of everyone trading in those same patterns.

9. Don't be a dumbass after a big winning trade that you have it together and can't lose. 

10. Don't get the attitude that, ""My bills are paid, this is just house money at this point."" and make risky yolo plays just because. You will lose your hard earned winnings very quickly by trying to have fun instead of making money. 

The biggest advice is to not even trade options and to trade stocks. It may seem harder to do with a small account because a 10% gain on $100 is only $10. However it is better than buying a weekly only for it to theta burn 49% by the next day forcing you to sell at a huge loss."

Just this past month I was up 500k on 6/9 at the opening bell (CLOV yolo) only to bag hold them and then tried to ""buy the dip"". I didn't sell until it was way too late and watched almost all my profits disappear. It would of been my biggest trade ever but I fucking blew it going for more. I regret it daily, would of been life changing for me.

2021-06-26 19:41:59,wallstreetbets,"Hey OP, there's a lot of advice here, and I can see you are going through it.

Why don't you tell us what's going on in your mind when your finger refuses to hit the sell button both when you are green and red.

To me that's screaming ""I don't have an exit strategy!""  

How much up would ever be enough? How much down?

My opinion: take yourself off margin; it will force a sell discipline on you.  Then work through a  ""take-profit"" strategy.  i.e. half at 30%, half when the play is ready to end.  (You can always rebuy at a later date).  Set up a stop loss for plays that don't go as planned.  Especially options!!  Buy shares or leaps because they hold value longer.  Stay off the FDs.  Every time you want to double down, put it into QYLD ETF or something like that.

See what happens to your account in 6 weeks."

If your win rate is very high that's a warning that you may be picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.

Write down each trade and figure out when you are going to exit on the upside or downside. Don't get too greedy, or too hopeful when a trade goes to hell that it will turn around. Me, I usually bail out once I'm losing a grand, depending on the position size.

 And you have to learn to let things go, and move on to the next trade when it goes bad.

It's really difficult. But are you doing this to make money or gamble for a fix? That is the question. You have to approach it like a poker player who fuckin grinds it out daily, fold, fold, fold, fold, then you hit big and get out.

I stopped options after I lost a whole bunch of money and made it back by doubling down. I realized I was just gambling and that I'm not smart enough or emotionally controlles enough to do options or day trading yet. I will say though I took the lessons from my failed options trading and have used it to make me a better investor in stocks and to pick good companys and just hold the positions through thick and thin.

Day Trading dosen't work with large amounts of capital, because you are competing with Market Makers and Large Institutional investors. They have quants doing daily Mathematical calculations. If you are not prepared to do that. Then don't Day Trade a single stock and fall in love. I track around 20 at a time. I might watch one stock for years before I make a trade. Sometimes it's a hit and run. Sometimes you can see a break in trend. First rule of stock pimpin. Never fall in love with a hoe stock. It's about cutting your losses or if it's running on trend. Let it run. Volume is key. Relative Strength is key. You have to use every tool. Not just a Hammer. Walking with a profit is win. I have never seen a trader going broke from taking a profit. Once you hit that goal you had in mind when you first bought it. Walk away. Re-evaluate. Watch the 1980's movie Wall Street. Dry Trade on Paper! 😎"

2021-06-26 12:23:13,wallstreetbets,How is it like gambling if you do your research and buy into a good company when their prices are on a dip….your odds of a contract being in the money are increased 10fold….it’s only gambling if you’re buying Disney FDs with a week expiration and 0 catalysts driving it’s price
2021-06-26 12:13:06,wallstreetbets,I honestly know that. And I’m worried this is making me scared. I’m scared to go into winning trades. I get out too quickly of wins too because of ptsd from loosing days
2021-06-26 14:32:11,wallstreetbets,You can loose and make money in literally any stock… this is not the issue

2021-06-26 12:23:07,wallstreetbets,"I wholeheartedly agree. But having a hard time not letting my current losses be. I tell my self, okay “I accept the fact that I’ve lost $xxx money and I won’t try to make it back”

2021-06-26 16:12:55,wallstreetbets,Never put more than 10% of total capital in a single trans and always take it out at a 10% loss that way you can never lose more than 1% of your overall portfolio on one trade. Easier said than done though.

2021-06-26 15:23:16,wallstreetbets,"How can I actually answer that?  Pure speculation I’m afraid. Ofc I’m now balls deep in $CLOV and my grip has gotten tighter over these past few months…

So with that mindset you're more prone to yoloing a couple hundred, or thousand, or whatever, on risky options. Because the money isn't in your checking account, it doesn't feel the same."
2021-06-26 12:26:31,wallstreetbets,Just this part week I lost 20 plus k. Was more than 1/5 of my wealth on a stupid FD trade thinking it’ll spike. Well it tanked and I sold. Came back to see it it was now more the. The premium I bought and am always telling myself “why couldn’t I have held longer to break even??” Well at least we can admit we have a problem. Also the way Robinhood has gamified trading is the huge problem
2021-06-26 16:53:53,wallstreetbets,I started taking topamax for my cocaine problem and I noticed I trade like 10x better. It's a anti-compulsive behavior drugs. I think this shit is super brain trading shit tbh.
2021-06-26 12:19:20,wallstreetbets,"Identify suspected support levels and how you’d react if it broke lower support. i.e. DCA, puts, or stop-loss limits based on entry. 
If you believe in the company with decent DD then close your eyes, take a breath, and zoom out a bit. 
If you bought into a meme-stock for a quick rush of profit and now you’re tanking with no trust in the long term of the underlying asset…then use it as a lesson learned and re-evaluate your portfolio. 
Everyone knows the rush of the meme stocks has a massive emotional pull but the associated potential for loss means you damn sure better have some exit plans should you need them.

2021-06-26 12:37:13,wallstreetbets,"Lol, yeah true. I started trading in feb 2021 with 40k. Ups and downs for months then started deteriorating maxing my margin. I was down to my last 5k. Then discovered call options at the right time. Market was back bullish and made about 10k tilray calls, then 25k on amc calls, then 10k on clne calls and shares and finally to wish 50k with calls and shares. This is definitely gambling the way I’m playing the market. Current position is 10,000 shares of wish and 60 15.5 7/16 calls. Scared for Monday….. if I have a successful week, I am going to sell all contracts and lower my shares so I won’t be in such a risky position.

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"High inflation? higher interest rates? what is your play? I picked $TRQ  

Alright retards, I’m writing this DD because I want you guys to buy $TRQ and I’m going to explain why. I will try to make it short, but there is a lot to cover. Bear with me.

First of all, I would like to disclose that I used to work for an investment fund as a commodities consultant. My job was to go through earning reports and keep up with geopolitical bullshit all over the globe. Now, I trade with my own funds. I work for myself. 

Now, let’s go back to J Pow. He said a couple of days ago that they expect inflation to go up. My autistic brain tells me that there will be some market movement and some funds will change hands. He also said that the rates would eventually go up. What will happen in the next 6 months to a year? With a higher Fed interest rate, Macroeconomically, high growth stocks will go down as well Dow stocks because it will become more expensive to borrow money. However, that change is scheduled two years down the road, so why the transition will happen faster? Because big capital is always ahead of the market, that’s why those pendejos stay rich. Big capital will dump all their high growth shit and move to safer options. As for inflation rate, higher rates trigger a transfer from growth stocks to commodities because those are considered refuge assets. Gold, Silver and all the other shit that your grandma loves to buy is part of that. Those things will go up, but me I don’t fuck with that boomer shit because I’d rather invest in a commodity that has real use and growth potential.

My two main targets are Uranium and copper.

I’ll come back to Uranium in a different DD but now let’s talk about copper. 

Commodities experts and market movements show that we might be in the beginning of a copper demand super-cycle. The reasons are the following:

[https://preview.redd.it/7dx2pcha92771.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=887bfe8ee882ba61696b9f4cb9b4428c4513a8e1](https://preview.redd.it/7dx2pcha92771.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=887bfe8ee882ba61696b9f4cb9b4428c4513a8e1)

* Copper resources are scarce, deposits are limited and it takes about 10 years to develop a new mine and start producing. There are no new mines in development now, just extensions. Copper producers cannot keep up with the global demand. 

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/copper-is-the-new-oil-and-could-hit-20000-per-ton-analysts-say.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/copper-is-the-new-oil-and-could-hit-20000-per-ton-analysts-say.html)

* Chinese demand for copper is out of control. They want to dominate the world’s economy and they are doing so by heavily investing in their infrastructure. Chinese demand for copper accounts for about 50% of the global supply. 

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/copper-prices-51623884044](https://www.barrons.com/articles/copper-prices-51623884044)

* Copper scrap supply is decreasing dramatically. The world is running out of copper to recycle and that’s good for miners 

[https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/copper-output-recycling-2020-icsg-data/](https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/copper-output-recycling-2020-icsg-data/)

* The cost of copper accounts for about 15% of the green energy transition (wind mills, EV’s, etc..)

[https://www.fnarena.com/index.php/2021/06/04/esg-focus-copper-key-to-energy-transition/](https://www.fnarena.com/index.php/2021/06/04/esg-focus-copper-key-to-energy-transition/)

* The U.S. is about to heavily invest in infrastructure (assuming that politicians figure out the difference between their buttholes and their mouths)
* Many other reasons will drive the copper prices up. Google it for fucks sake.

Now that we figured out that copper is a smart play. How to invest in copper? 

Option one, buy a couple tons of copper and store them in your mom’s shed and sell them in a couple of years, or option two, own stocks from a mining company that has a good outlook. I personally chose option two, but you do you. 

When I researched the different stocks, here are the final five that made the cut:

* Rio Tinto ([NYSE: RIO](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=RIO))
* Southern Copper Corporation ([NYSE: SCCO](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SCCO))
* Newmont Corporation ([NYSE: NEM](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=NEM))
* Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ([NYSE: FCX](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=FCX))
* **Turquoise Hill Resources (NYSE: TRQ)**

From the title of the article, you can tell that $TRQ is the one I picked. Why?

* Presently It has a P/E ratio of about 5.2. This stock is CHEAP for what the company delivers.
* The fundamentals are solid. Debt is under control and all the other metrics are solid (Trust me, I checked).
* After many years of development and negotiation with the government of Mongolia. The mine it owns finally started delivering. The first of SIX Oyu Tolgoi deposits is beating yield expectations by almost the double. The first open pit deposit is scheduled to be followed by a more promising underground deposit expected to deliver 550,000 tons of copper yearly by 2025, from about 145,000 now.
* Rio Tinto managed to own 51% of TRQ via hostile acquisitions and is now trying to dilute the stock and the goal is to own the whole fucking thing. They found some success because the stock suffered some big setbacks due to a heavy short activity. Their pressure won’t last though because TRQ is gaining a lot of visibility among investors (gained about 15% the last three days)
* Again, you need to do your own research and you’ll figure out why this stock is promising. Stop being lazy and stop believing everything you read on Reddit. 

this is my position:

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Case for Leveraged ETFs: A Simulation-based Analysis \[This is a long post, so please let me know if I made any errors\]

\[Posting again because I made a mistake in the first version that I wasn't able to edit for some reason. Also, posting this as discussion because I don't think this is suitable as DD. It isn't as extensive as most DD is, and I'm here to see what other people think.\]

\[Also, no part of this post should be construed as financial/investing advice. You should always do your due diligence before putting your money anywhere, and this is no exception.\]

Tl;dr: Leveraged ETFs such as SPXL, UPRO, TQQQ tend to be very favorable over the long run, despite popular belief. They tend to over-perform their leverage when the return is positive, and under-perform their leverage when the return is negative, causing there to be a sort of lopsided upside.

In this post, I attempt to find a way to model the return of SPXL, a 3x leveraged bull S&P 500 ETF, based on the return of SPY, over long periods of time (mainly 1 year).

It seems that the general consensus among investors is that leveraged ETFs are a bad long-term investment mainly because these ETFs only multiply the the return of the underlying *daily.* For example, SPXL, a 3x leveraged fund that tracks SPY, only returns 3-times the return of SPY daily, so if SPY goes up 3% on a given day, it goes up 9%. The implication of this is that there is a great deal of uncertainty over the *long-term* return of the leveraged ETF - there is no guarantee that the ETF multiplies the return of the underlying over longer periods of time.

The second main argument against leveraged ETFs is that, as a consequence of the magnified movement of the underlying up and down, the math works against leveraged ETFs, causing them to lose value over time - a phenomenon known as **negative return bias**. People that support this point argue that this negative return bias causes the leveraged ETF to underperform the underlying in the long run, and, in many cases, even go down when the underlying goes up. Although there is some evidence to back this, a closer look at the historical returns of SPXL and SPY in green years would say otherwise - SPXL out-performed SPY in 2019, 2017, 2016, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2010, 2009. An important outlier here is 2020, in which SPXL under-performed SPY despite it being a green year. I will address the reasons behind this later on. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVt6ilphs7Q&amp;t=499s) does a better job debunking this belief by performing an autocorrelation t-test to determine if the negative return bias is statistically significant. It is not.

Either way, the main purpose of this post is not to counter the second argument, but to address the concern behind the uncertainty of the long-term returns of leveraged ETFs. I did so by trying to develop a mathematical model that predicts the return of the 3x leveraged ETF (SPXL) based on the return of underlying (SPY) over a one-year timeframe.

First, I collected the historical prices of SPY daily since 1993. Then, I calculated the daily return of SPY (in %) every day since 1993 using the formula: (close - open)/open \* 100 to get a distribution of all daily returns historically for SPY. I could now model SPY's movement over longer periods of time by stringing together these returns - specifically, I was able to simulate SPY's yearly return and a 3x leveraged S&P bull by randomly selecting 250 daily returns (since there are 250 trading days in a year) from my distribution of all daily returns. I did this 10,000 times to simulate 10,000 years. I then plotted the the 3x daily-leveraged ETF VS SPY, and the results were interesting:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kcwtxloxpm771.png?width=397&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d3f8a25ccdf5c3e5cee47e387d82caa4c8ed11f

As you can see, there seems to be a very clear polynomial/exponential pattern shown with some variability. I fit a cubic model to this data and it seems to be a nice fit:

&#x200B;

[The axes are kind of mislabeled: it was supposed to say SPXL on the y-axis and SPY on the x-axis, not vice-versa.](https://preview.redd.it/r122j7zypm771.png?width=397&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9644507150cfe0e85956b7f7f146b579499fb5a)

My primary observation is that the data seems to be curved in a way that makes the 3x leveraged ETF very favorable - it tends to overperform the 3x leverage when SPY goes up (for instance, when SPY goes up 25% in a year, it is estimated that the leveraged ETF will go up by more than 75%, in this case almost 100%) - and it tends to underperform the 3x leverage when SPY goes down (for instance, when SPY goes down 10%, it is estimated that the leveraged ETF will go down by less than 30%. This is supported by historical data - SPY has gone up an impressive 42% in the last year while SPXL has returned 173%, more than 3\*42 = 126%.

Obviously this model would be meaningless if I didn't test it with actual, historical data. SPXL was established back in 2009, so I used the plugged all the yearly returns of SPY since 2009 into my model to predict the yearly returns of SPXL since 2009, and I compared those findings to the actual yearly returns of SPXL since 2009. On average, I was off by about 9%, which isn't really that impressive but is still reasonable when you take into account that the average absolute return of SPXL is about 56%. To me, overestimating or underestimating 56% by 9% isn't a big deal. From what I saw, it is very good in predicting the return if the volatility is less, since that leaves less room for compounded variability. The model was eerily accurate in predicting the return of 173% in the last year - it was off by about 2%. It was very inaccurate in predicting the return of SPXL in 2020, mainly because that was a period of high volatility and low net movement. I haven't really rigorously tested the model, but I plan on doing so when I get the time. 

An analysis with QQQ and TQQQ yields similar results, which leads me to believe that leveraged ETFs are a good way to get better returns. Although it isn't advisable to pour your life savings into such instruments, investing a part of your portfolio in leveraged ETFs might be the move.

If you've made it this far, thanks a lot for reading! Please let me know if I've made any mistakes and/or if you agree or disagree with my findings.

2021-06-26 18:48:02,wallstreetbets,"Some simple math can show you why this is a dumb idea.  Imagine there’s a stock called X and a 3x leveraged etf of it called XXX and they both start at 100

Day 1: 
X loses 20% so it’s at 80
XXX loses 60% so it’s at 40
Day 2: 
X gains 25% its back at 100
XXX gains 75% and its at 70

So you’ve lost 30% while the stock is flat. If prices this year are volatile but mostly flat those holding those ETFs will suck, if prices go down you will be crying / getting margin called lol"

2021-06-26 19:29:17,wallstreetbets,That autocorrelation test is only giving you that result because you’re basing it off of SPY x3 which has mostly gone straight up and there’s no guarantee that’s going to keep happening.  Try the same test with LABU or GUSH

Since february i am trying to be one of you beautiful apes.
I first bought at 100.
Second time was Around 250.
I hold at over 400 and Never Sold.
I saw it going down to around 30 and I bought the dip.
Then there was a long time nothing. Only sideways but I hold.
At one day I saw something strange. It was green after a looong time red.
Then there was the second time I went up and the 17th time “ThEy CoVeReD”.
Me and my best fellow ape are holding. 
We never sold at a high level to buy more shares at the dip.
No I am getting sad. Do I waste money for no reason? Our intention was and still is to hold to the freaking end. 
But will there be a Happy End for us?
Please excuse my bad English 
Kind regards

2021-06-26 11:35:41,wallstreetbets,"The public short interest of GME is like < 17% currently, not 140% as it had been back early Jan before the price went from $15ish to almost $500 (hint: many of the old shorts had to cover. That was the entire point of the rally).

\[and yes, I understand the % is most likely under reported because institutions don't have to share.\]

Just on retail brokerages alone (e.g.: IBKR, Fidelity, Merrill, etc), there's MILLIONS of available legal shares to short GME (this was not the case until the past two weeks+). And the fee to short is like less than two dollars a year per share. Then there's institutional brokerages with possibly even far more legal shares available to short.

So... what are all these cultists talking about. Who knows.

If shorts don't have to cover when price goes from $4 to $500ish on January, then why should they ever need to cover. Say they shorted 10% of their money. $4 to $500 means that 10% became 1250%. And GME margin call requirements became like 3\~5x in many brokerages (and high fees) during Jan squeeze.

So if someone had $1000 and shorted at $4 20% of his/her money, that someone would have by share price of $500 had a brokerage account with net worth of -$1500. Yes. NEGATIVE $1500. If you truly believe no one ever needs to cover when in negative money, then why should those group EVER need to cover. At that point, you have to accept the entire US Govt is corrupt and you will never win. Clearly, what's to stop institutions from having negative infinity dollar net worth?

Oh and by the way, institutions like Citadel have been reporting record level profits this year. Apparently all this retail stupidity has helped market makers like Citadel (who took both positions) make a net profit in tens of billions of dollars.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: You are probably deep in a MLM pyramid like structure cult. It's a pump and dump scheme.

Also, if you never sell, then you never realize profits. That means you never made money. You do know.. to make money, you buy low sell high in the stock market, right? Money doesn't come out of thin air. It requires active participants on both sides.

Plus, most of in real life people I know (including me) have promoted to keep holding/buying while selling ourselves at a profit. You never thought that maybe many people here want you to keep buying/holding so they can sell quietly at a huge profit?

Also, shorts WANT the price to go up. Just short at $320+ and cover at $200s (will also increase price). Hope other idiots join and pump up the stock again. Then rinse and repeat. I wouldn't be surprised if shorts are also doing regular buys in order to make prices to go up in hopes even more suckers go in. Got to milk dumb money as much as possible when you can. Plus, hedging these is so cheap by buying those unrealistic calls. A few thousand dollars can hedge against hundreds of thousands of dollars easily. So those hedging (insurances) while shorting exists too. Then there's also continuously selling impossible puts/calls to make money from those premium. Imagine someone buying 5 cent puts of GME.

Remember, money is made from both sides. There is nothing wrong with both going long and short and making money from the volatility. You are in the stock market to profit (I think). Only risk what you are willing to lose in the stock market. And on speculative bets like this one, invest money that you are fine with never having had in your life."

2021-06-26 11:10:10,wallstreetbets, Not reading disclosures and/or not responding to emails/calls… nothing more to say other than buying volatile stocks via loans is beyond dangerous- you have no recourse.  Need a new plan for the remaining scraps
2021-06-26 11:34:45,wallstreetbets,"Its in the contract and shouldnt be a surprise.  All brokers send out notice and even Vanguard sent you a couple.  Playing with margins, if you arent sure, can cause chaos.

When I go on margin, I always watch my House/exchange surplus and SMA.  Any go negative, margin calls follow."

2021-06-26 13:37:02,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, just maybe, when you get a margin call you should meet it and not let it sit for 2 weeks. Also might be a good idea to learn what margin means and does. We joke about being retarded but you might actually have just gone “full retard” 😂😂"
2021-06-26 10:54:05,wallstreetbets,"Margin called. And yes, you should have known this was going to happen because it is in their ToS or whatever. Next time, whenever your account gets flagged for this, act on it. Also, use a better brokerage. Vanguard blows."

2021-06-26 12:10:45,wallstreetbets,"I’m in a similar situation (not $72k situation) and after seeing this, I decided to pick up my phone and make a call.   Glad I did as it was a wonderful conversation over all and very informative.   

That fine print is worth reading when ever money is involved."
2021-06-26 11:48:58,wallstreetbets,How long do you expect them to let you sit in the negative? A couple weeks seems pretty generous to me tbh. I would liquidate your shitty positions the same day they went red if it were up to me. You just got a free 100k loan for a week or two... if anything you should be thanking them.

2021-06-26 14:30:38,wallstreetbets,"Lol what do you think the letters were telling you? You should be glad they gave you as long as they did. Interactive brokers liquidates your shit same day, no warning.

As for getting the stocks back, the answer is no. What you can do is deposit cash and repurchase the securities at market value. For the ones sold at a loss they will be a wash sale for tax purposes. If they were sold at a gain you will owe taxes, unless your broker offers t+1 settlement, in which case you can match the lots to keep the original position open. But even that would require your broker to allow you to trade with wired funds immediately, which may not he the case.

Best advice: Learn your lesson now. Sounds like you had a fairly small amount invested, don't do dumb shit again."

2021-06-26 16:01:15,wallstreetbets,They changed their in-house risk assessment of the tickers you hold in your account in increased the margin requirements…you obviously failed their stress test under their new standards so they liquidated your positions until you no longer had a margin call…. Good lesson for all of us not to be caught bag-holding too many meme stocks!

2021-06-26 14:32:05,wallstreetbets,I got margin called for having a CLOV position that was up 60% on margin last week. It was only like 2% of my port value. Crazy shit
2021-06-26 14:44:25,wallstreetbets,You need to call your broker BEFORE they margin call you and arrange to add more collateral to your account.   When you’re trading on margin think of the amount of cash that you put in as the max loss you can tolerate before the margin call comes.
2021-06-26 14:44:58,wallstreetbets,My friend told me when he gets margin called he just doesn't sell LOL. How do I tell him thats not how it works
2021-06-26 15:50:43,wallstreetbets,"I’m happy to say i am no longer at max margin and have the ability to get out of it without depositing money.   Let them liquidate it is my opinion.  The stock most likely be cheaper buying it all over again.  Especially wish.  Lmao

I will never do margin again."
2021-06-26 15:54:43,wallstreetbets,Never buy on margin doing this since 1979 and learned a  big lesson!! This is already triggered unless you can get someone on the phone Monday morning at 9 before the market opens sitting at your bank ACH 32K and send them the confirmation from the bank that you covered the margin call.
2021-06-26 16:33:00,wallstreetbets,"Possibly not the same. But, when you agree to margin calls on TD Ameritrade you have to  agree if your account becomes to low TD Ameritrade will sell shares of stocks you own to cover the margins.

I got flagged twice in two weeks for making trades before funds had cleared. They recommended / offered a margin account.

When I seen the right to sell other stocks to cover margins I decided I would rather risk a 3rd strike.
Wasn't going to give a gate keeper the right to move my money as they see fit (halting trades on GME was the red flag for me on that).

I just wait on funds to clear, or keep a little readily available."
2021-06-26 17:09:13,wallstreetbets,This sounds fake as fuck. Ban?
2021-06-26 19:22:33,wallstreetbets,You need a stop limit otherwise volatility can mess you up.
2021-06-26 19:29:47,wallstreetbets,HAH! Goteeeeem!
2021-06-26 19:53:03,wallstreetbets,"As everyone says, they have the right to do that unfortunately and they must have warned you before with an email.

If you want to keep doing margin trading, you have to learn to put stop orders yourself, and also, never, EVER make the mistake or depositing more funds to cover a losing position. Been there, done that ... You'll just end up losing even more. When doing margin you gotta learn to take the loss and live another day. I transformed 1.5k into 35k in 8 months, then lost them 35k in 24 hours because I kept moving the stop order to avoid losing money.... and ended up losing everything. Margin : You win big, you lose big. Make sure you can't lose big. Set up "" close "" (as in not far from market price) stop orders. Thing is, it's problematic with meme stocks because high volatility... So that's why it's almost always a bad idea to do margin on high volatility stocks like tesla, meme stocks, Dow Jones ect, because when a stock moves a lot, you can't really put close stop orders, but if you don't, you're in deep shit. So either watch for high volatility stocks, or take smaller positions. If you have 50k, do a 10k position so you have 40k of collaterall and you know the broker isn't gonna liquidate your position. On leverage this 10k position will still mean huge business."
2021-06-26 10:42:18,wallstreetbets,Damn this sucks huh
2021-06-26 10:49:15,wallstreetbets,SPCE was up 40% yesterday - did they liquidate before or after the rise ?
2021-06-26 13:09:46,wallstreetbets,"You need to be really careful using margin... cocksucker trading companies (all of them) will allow you to margin to the max... then tomorrow change the margin requirements, without notice, so that you are now over-margin and then sell your positions (usually on a ticker that will rise the very next day). I held ACB a couple years back... it had 50% margin requirement, one day, then out of the blue, that requirement jumped to 100% and they sold off some of my positions. FUCK THESE CUNTS - don't use margin!"
2021-06-26 13:54:08,wallstreetbets,"There seems to be some misunderstanding about wash sales. As I understand it it will remain a wash sale if you continue to hold the stock you took a loss on then rebought through the end of the year. If you sell a stock and don’t rebuy for a certain period of time before the end of the year the adjusted cost basis is then taken into account and you can claim the loss. The issue with wash sales is when when you own the same security through the end of the year the prior years loss can’t be deducted until you sell.

The cost basis of the loss is added to his current replacement  shares 

I buy Boeing at 320, 100 shares 

Then sell at 300

2000 loss 

Then rebuy at 320 my cost basis is now $340. 

Now if in the same year before December I sell Boeing for $360 my capital gain is $2000

In a different scenario  let’s at I buy high sell low twice. 

Instead of selling at $360 I sell a second time at $300 before December. 

My capital losses are now $4000 because of the adjusted cost basis from my wash sale and as I understand can now be claimed in that same tax year as long as I don’t rebuy again initiating a new wash sale and the process starts over adjusting the cost basis if I do.

Now if I held the stock long through the end of the year then the wash sale dictates I can’t claim the loss from my first sale. This is to prevent people from selling for a loss. Writing it off then rebuying and gaming then system."

2021-06-26 14:33:39,wallstreetbets,"Vanguard is honestly too kind. Do this in Robinhood and you are margin called in 1 hour, not weeks.

Just which brokerage after over a week of -$75k and issuing of messages WOULDN'T margin call you.

2021-06-26 10:56:41,wallstreetbets,They told you in the terms and agreement you signed. They usually liquidate your assets in 1 day too. I’m guessing you have a big account or they are making good money from you to allow you to drag for a week or two. You should switch to another broker that allows you to make your own rules on the go and this will never happen lol.
2021-06-26 11:12:41,wallstreetbets,"They don’t have to.  They did a margin call and you ignored it.  Reread the TOS of margin when you applied for it.  All of your answers are in there.  

You went from -72k to -32k.   This sounds like you needed to deposit $72,000.00 to satisfy your margin requirements from the onset."
2021-06-26 12:59:29,wallstreetbets,"What part of ‘they don’t have to tell you’ do you not understand?
If you play the margin game, you are officially their bitch."
2021-06-26 11:05:04,wallstreetbets,Yep. They’ll be in for a rude awakening when they see the adjusted cost basis for their new shares.
2021-06-26 18:00:57,wallstreetbets,Yes but the basis in the shares he buys will include the loss that was denied due to the wash sale.   Since he didn't intend to sell he'll be in the exact same place he would have been when he finally does sell the shares. A wash sale does not mean that your loss is gone forever. It just gets attached to the shares you purchased and deferred until you sell those shares at which time it will decrease the gain hopefully which you will have.
2021-06-26 11:14:33,wallstreetbets,The way to do this is to buy Call Options on those shares they sold for the same amounts. Calls at the strike of the Margin Call sells. Make them for 30 Days out or more to cover the wash rules. Then you can take a tax loss without losing a possible run. In 30 days if the stocks are even cheaper then you can thank them.
2021-06-26 17:33:36,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but the losses get added back to the cost basis once he re-buys the shares so it doesnt make any difference tax wise."
2021-06-26 13:05:59,wallstreetbets,"So?  It will be the same as if he had never sold, which is what he wants."
2021-06-26 12:12:42,wallstreetbets,"So what?  He said he didn't want to sell the stocks.  So, he deposits the money and buys them back.  The only way he would be harmed is if the stocks go up in the meantime."
2021-06-26 16:03:40,wallstreetbets,But wash won’t matter if his positions return to his original entry points….
2021-06-26 17:59:07,wallstreetbets,Only really matters for end of year stuff.
2021-06-26 10:51:26,wallstreetbets,"It’s in the contract. They are not obligated to inform you about your account getting liquidated because you didn’t meet your margin call requirements sooner.

Edit: adding the legal terms here 

Vanguard Brokerage Services can force the sale of Securities and Other Property in Your Account. You are not entitled to choose which Securities or other assets in Your Account will be liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. If the equity in Your Account falls below the maintenance margin requirements, or Vanguard Brokerage Services' higher ""house"" maintenance margin requirements (see next item below), Vanguard Brokerage Services reserves the right to sell the Securities and Other Property in Your Account to cover the margin deficiency.

2021-06-26 10:56:49,wallstreetbets,Good - because if they margin called me the day before a 40% rise my wife and kids would have to leave the house for a few weeks because I would be impossible to live with.

2021-06-26 18:01:44,wallstreetbets,It's actually from a tax perspective it is a great awakening not a rude one as his basis will be higher than what he pays for these new shares
2021-06-26 14:13:29,wallstreetbets,I dont think this works.  Wash rules state options count the same as shares.  You sure on this?
2021-06-26 13:51:08,wallstreetbets,">	It will be the same as if he had never sold,

Not to the IRS when he eventually decides that he does want to sell.  And when the meme magic wears off and WISH goes back to $8, well, he’ll want to be able to claim that loss. 

He can accomplish the same without a wash sale by purchasing ATM leaps for Jan or Dec 2022."
2021-06-26 12:42:13,wallstreetbets,You can get a 3k capital loss deduction on your taxes per year and roll over the rest to the following years. If OP buys within 30 days he cannot claim that loss. Technically right now OP has a realized loss. Now obviously this doesn’t matter in the long run if OP manages to make the money back but just a nice tax deduction to take advantage of if you’ve already realized the loss
2021-06-26 10:58:04,wallstreetbets,"You mean he can’t just borrow 30k until his meme stocks go back up?

So rude of the broker not giving him the benefit of the doubt that he “could have deposited immediately”"

2021-06-26 12:20:41,wallstreetbets,what's a margin call and how can I use it to fund my whoredash bills (seriously someone plz enlighten me)
2021-06-26 18:01:23,wallstreetbets,You are 100% correct. Source is a long time as a tax lawyer
2021-06-26 17:42:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, we’re all saying the same thing. It’s because of the tax impact that the cost basis gets changed. Source: decades of investing."
2021-06-26 14:42:41,wallstreetbets,"It's a grey area what counts as a wash sale and what doesn't, but an at the money call is not substantially similar to owning the stock imo. If you bought a call and sold a put then you'd have a wash sale, or if you bought a deep in the money call, or sold a deep in the money put. I don't think there have been any cases to set precedent on this issue so long story short, nobody really knows."
2021-06-26 14:33:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you can switch between options and stocks. It’s only really if you buy and sell the same security. 

For example: buy a leap, stock plummets and you cut losses. bounces back up, buy the same leap again= wash sale 

Sell stock, buy leap however is fine, as long as your expiry date is after 30 days. You are buying a derivative and the actual ownership of shares doesn’t take effect until you exercise"
2021-06-26 14:30:33,wallstreetbets,"No, it is as if he never sold.  That's how a wash sale works.  It treats a sale and a repurchase as though the sale never happened (other then the holding period being reset)

You do not lose the capital loss.  It just gets deferred until you sell."
2021-06-26 13:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Sure.  But his point was that he didn’t want to sell.  So, if he can buy back at the same price, no harm done.  Or, he could wait more than 30 days and take the chance that the stock won’t go up in that time."
2021-06-26 11:06:30,wallstreetbets,I work in a brokerage firm. If OP had just made a phone call explaining the situation this could have been easily avoided. Different brokers have different margin requirements but if you just call and explain they might give you an extra 2-3 days to meet your margin call requirements.
2021-06-26 14:26:39,wallstreetbets,"I know lots joke about it here, but some people here are LITERALLY gamblers and should seriously consider Gamblers Anonymous. Being down +$50,000 and thinking ""hmm I'll double down and win it all back"" is textbook gambling..lmao no joke it's not even funny"
2021-06-26 11:00:00,wallstreetbets,Please also read my other comment on wash sale loss. If you buy back the stocks you sold for a loss you will not be able to deduct those losses from your tax returns. You get $3000 a year in capital losses you can claim on your tax return but not if it is a wash sale loss meaning you bought the security right back (within 30 days) after selling it for a loss
2021-06-26 14:59:38,wallstreetbets,Shorting meme stocks is so smart.
2021-06-26 14:19:18,wallstreetbets,"I mean that is funny, just don't want OP to take a dirt nap with Jesus"

2021-06-26 12:47:44,wallstreetbets,Ask your wife’s boyfriend for help. He’ll be more than happy
2021-06-26 18:03:56,wallstreetbets,Seems we were all pretty much saying the same thing lol a lot of people think they would be on the hook for taxes for all the gains from the lower price share purchase and lose out on the loss. So figured I'd try and clarify
2021-06-26 15:01:12,wallstreetbets,Exactly. An Option is just that. It's the Option to buy or sell a security at the Strike Price. So if they sold your 1200 shares at say $15. You buy 12 Call Options for a $15 strike price on Monday that is 30 days out from Monday's date. The 30 Days is minimum for wash sells. So you could go 60 days. But you won't be assigned the stock for 30 Days or more if done correctly. So technically you don't own that stock yet. Until that Strike date when you will be assigned. And that's only if the stock price is over the strike price on the Option on the expiration date. So it is very much legal. You think Large Banks and Brokers lose. No they created loopholes for tax purposes. If the stock never goes back over the $15 price on the expiration date. You lose that premium you paid to buy that Option. But not more. If it's over the price. Then you still keep all the gain even if the stock is then $500. That's the beauty of Options. If you are serious about investing. Options should be a component of your trading. For Protection. And Leverage.
2021-06-26 14:33:11,wallstreetbets,As others have suggested OP might be better off buying LEAPS here to take advantage of this unfortunate situation. But that’s a higher risk IMO given the money OP has already lost so far
2021-06-26 12:21:56,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense.

OP went with the ol “I’ll ask for forgiveness later instead of permission”"
2021-06-26 14:39:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it’s going to be a big problem. 

That’s why I’m long on draftkings. Let’s keep the degeneracy going into the football season."
2021-06-26 11:03:38,wallstreetbets,Will do thank you
2021-06-26 13:11:19,wallstreetbets,"This is a bit misleading.

He won't be able to deduct right now.  But the loss gets added to his basis so he gets the deduction when he finally sells.    So it's just as if he never sold, which is what he wants.

Also, if you actually have capital gains (I know, that's a stretch for some) you can (actually, you must) deduct all your losses against them.  The $3k cap is what you can deduct against regular income, if you have any regular income (again, a stretch for some)"
2021-06-26 18:19:16,wallstreetbets,And you did well
2021-06-26 19:00:39,wallstreetbets,Would a LEAP option qualify as a “substantially identical” security and therefore be problematic in terms of the wash sale rule?  I’ve never tried to do it.
2021-06-26 12:48:27,wallstreetbets,"Lmao yea OP is completely at fault here. I’ve seen this happen so many times and see our customers enraged and I’m like you didn’t even bother to call us back but expect us to run behind you ? 

Most of these processes are automated so the stocks would have been sold the very next day if OP didn’t meet the margin requirement the same day."
2021-06-26 12:53:03,wallstreetbets,And to add if the customer calls and explains us their situation we might even figure out a way to get them out for a lesser loss by waiting and trying to get the best price for the losses they have. Again upto the customers to work with the broker and get them out of the hole. We’ve sometimes saved hundreds of thousands of dollars by not liquidating at market open and giving the client some time to get out at a better price
2021-06-26 14:29:07,wallstreetbets,"Agreed but why not take advantage of this if OP has a realized loss ? 

Think about it this way, example - OP has a $12k realized loss. Let’s say OP waits for a month to buy $WISH back or buys another meme security and say makes a killing on it but holds on to that for > a year. OP can deduct 3k for 4 years against other capital gains or regular income while enjoying an unrealized gain with long term capital tax when he does cash out. Win-win

I know this might not specifically work out for most folks but my point is there is an advantage to salvage the best out of this situation."
2021-06-26 14:33:29,wallstreetbets,"Because he wants to hold it.  WISH may be $25 in a month.

By your logic you should sell any time you have a loss and wait a month.  The problem with this is that you will miss a lot of rebounds and often end up rebuying at a higher price."
2021-06-26 14:38:07,wallstreetbets,"Yes ofcourse if you think the stock is going back up there is no harm in buying it back immediately. My point - don’t take a loss, if you happen to take one take the tax advantage and don’t take a disallowed wash sale loss UNLESS, as you said, you believe you might miss out on big gains."
2021-06-26 14:44:13,wallstreetbets,"There is nothing wrong with a wash sale.

""Disallowed"" makes it seem like you never get it.  (I understand that that's the term that's used, but it's only disallowed for that year)

It's just deferred until you sell.  It's not punitive, and it's not meant to be.  There is no good reason to actively avoid wash sales."
2021-06-26 14:46:05,wallstreetbets,"True, it’s more like deferred wash sale loss until you finally sell"
2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PGR Progressive Corporation - About to rise? **$PGR Progressive Corp** is one of the largest insurance providers in the US and have operations in Europe and other markets worldwide. $PGR is best known for its auto insurance products and have a variety of personal (life/pet/home/contents) and commercial policies as well. 

They could be on the brink of shooting up with a surge of new policies from new car sales on the horizon and accelerated growth from their recent acquisition of Protective Insurance. Even without this, they are a great company with solid fundamentals and a low risk/high gain potential to add to your portfolio.

**Onto the detailed DD:**

The pandemic forced automakers to curb production due to parts shortages and as a result, new car sales declined and US automakers like GM and Ford saw a steep decline in sales, earnings and revenue. 

Recently, we’ve been seeing the demand (and therefore prices) in the used car markets reaching all time highs as restrictions are being relaxed and stores opening back up. It’s so high, that certain used cars, like trucks, are being sold at higher price than new due to the long-ass lead times in getting a new car with automakers experiencing supply constraints (mainly semiconductor/chip shortage).

That’s all about to turn as we might be seeing used car sales peaking and for automakers, the worst might now be over with semiconductor shortage possibly ending [based on a recent Bloomberg article.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-24/used-car-prices-are-poised-to-peak-in-u-s-after-pandemic-surge)

With new cars being made available, Progressive will be able to provide new insurance policies for these vehicles. Buyers of new automobiles are also more likely to go for optional coverage, such as comprehensive insurance compared to a buyer of a used car. 

With $PGRs new acquisition of Protective Insurance, they inherited their customers, clients and momentum in the commercial space. It’s expected this acquisition will provide greater growth opportunities in the commercial market and fleet sales for $PGR. 

**Onto the fundamentals:**

* Price to Earnings ratio **(P/E) of 8.81**. A very low number vs the market (lower is better). 
* Growing revenue and earning YoY. Even with the pandemic, **Progressive grew 43% in earnings from 2019 to 2020**.
* **Debt to Equity ratio is a healthy 30%** (lower is better) and indicates a low risk investment to its shareholders. 
* Progressive has a total Free Cash Flow **(FCF) of $7 Billion**

Their recent earnings report just missed analysts targets which caused it to dip to 90.21 (lowest it's been in 3-4mths). it’s been steadily climbing ever since and now at 96.70 but is still below its 50 day average of 98.79 and well below its peak of 107.59. 

At this stage, its hard to say when we’ll expect to see $PGR rise up. It will likely blow past its ATH after confirmation that automakers are no longer supply constrained but even excluding that, it's a safe place to park some of your portfolio if you have no other calls/stocks to put it into.

Lastly, Progressive is Insurance…so customers literally pay them on a term-basis for coverage of their assets. When the customer gets into an accident, they make a claim and then Progressive determines whether to cover them or not (ain’t that some shit 😂😂). They’re also not just leaving your money in some savers account, they’re investing your money into other securities, making **your** money work for **them** 🤣. Ok ok, Im making it sound like Insurance is this thieving asshole but when you’re in a pickle, they are there to offer support and financial help.

I’ve contributed a shitload of my portfolio (95%) to $PGR but really, this DD (apart from fundamentals) probably applies to any major insurance provider so choose your pick if you found this helpful. thanks for reading!

I’m in with $1,170,000 in stock or >12k in shares 💰💰"

2021-06-26 12:01:11,wallstreetbets,"I worked for Progressive for 5 years. They were printing money in WA state where I worked, customer service is amazing, and so is the training. We would get poached by other companies all the time. At the time too they’d just made the purchase for ASI, which they turned into progressive home. State Farm will run their auto program at a loss because they make their money off their investment portfolio and they have a death grip on the housing insurance market. Housing market is a huge step and they were taking it in stride and hiring the talent to make it work. Progressive was innovating with their Snapshot program, they have a tool that allows you to compare rates to other companies on Progressive Direct, and they also make money hand over first on their commercial and personal lines policies (think boats and shit). In regards to commercial, quick google search will show you they are the number one carrier for that type of policy and it isn’t close. Common critique is self driving cars and typical auto insurance might be on the way out. That’s years to decades down the road where the market has that many self driving cars it matters and also, you think Tesla is going to want to self insure every car they sell? Nope. USA is ungodly litigious and insurance will always play a role. 

Not financial advice and this is just my opinion. Do your own DD. I’m a moron and look at my flair  if you would like to confirm just how much if a moron I am."

2021-06-26 12:05:47,wallstreetbets,Knowing WSB is a shill pump n dump headquaters now it makes it hard for me to upvote anything from this sub.  Liked the vid though!

2021-06-26 13:27:39,wallstreetbets,"No they play video games. Cartoons are always available now. We used yo look forward to Sat mornings during winter.

2021-06-26 15:03:15,wallstreetbets,Fun fact! There is a YouTube channel called rinse repeat that creates old Saturday morning cartoon blocks by stitching cartoons from a certain station from a certain year together with commercials that were also on air.

The gases can be used by certain engines to move from point a to point b. $CLNE is one of the rising companies that does this conversion from cow poop to clean renewable natural gases.

2021-06-26 18:40:07,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know about other countries, but in the USA our Saturday cartoons were removed from air many years ago. Decades ago. Cable is another thing though."
2021-06-26 18:44:13,wallstreetbets,There's a channel that plays them called MeTV on Saturdays. I think they still have it going and the nostalgia overload was real when I tuned in.
2021-06-26 19:13:05,wallstreetbets,Cartoon name?
2021-06-26 19:15:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's called Congress, except it's a sad fucking rerun that just keeps on playing, over, and over, and over, and over, and over...."
2021-06-26 19:21:18,wallstreetbets,Top 10+ comments don't mention the stock in any way. Is that normal?
2021-06-26 19:27:57,wallstreetbets,They shut it down for DPTV (Detroit Public Television) for lack of funding. Well it isn’t entirely gone it’s just replaced with educational television since the city couldn’t afford to keep it up. I feel like saturday cartoons are a landmark for any poor kid’s childhood so rip to a special experience for an entire new generation
2021-06-26 19:28:44,wallstreetbets,"No. We dont have Saturday morning cartoons any more because some Karen decided ""Advertising to children was Immoral"" and while they are absolutely correct on a certain level - Saturday morning cartoons were 100% about advertising to children.

So, now we dont have Saturday morning cartoons. Nor do we have He-Man or Gi-Joe action figures - Not even a Jesus with Karate Chop Action. Cracker Jacks no longer have toy prizes and neither do cereal boxes and to really add insult to injury we cant even have kinder eggs without smuggling them like crack from Germany. 

In the spirit of trying to do something right, I feel like something worse was done. But Ill admit I am old - But my dad used to buy a box of donuts for me about once a month so Id have a special snack to watch the Road Runner absolutely wreck the coyote and man, I thought those days were special  - And some do-gooder had to take that away from kids, probably forever and I think that is fucking sad."
2021-06-26 19:33:06,wallstreetbets,"No more 4kids, kids wb or fox box. That used to be the ishh. Missed those Saturday lineups"
2021-06-26 19:55:23,wallstreetbets,Turned the TV on today because it's the first Saturday I've had off in 7 years and nothing but dam news! WTF
2021-06-26 10:59:14,wallstreetbets,No because they’re all infected with Cultural Marxism now.

2021-06-26 12:58:11,wallstreetbets,We need this in every stock subreddit
2021-06-26 15:50:37,wallstreetbets,I have a feeling their version of begging will be blaming us for the whole thing. More of a guilt trip tactic.

2021-06-26 11:43:08,wallstreetbets,My Saturday mornings were Pokémon followed by the Jackie Chan cartoon

2021-06-26 15:55:44,wallstreetbets,2 cups of sugar? That ain’t right
2021-06-26 14:29:29,wallstreetbets,Mac n cheese because I got up at noon. 😂

2021-06-26 10:59:29,wallstreetbets,How else are you supposed to teach kids about gravity? Waiting for them to fall down the stairs?
2021-06-26 11:49:06,wallstreetbets,Ren and Stimpy isn't educational? Damn...
2021-06-26 11:51:16,wallstreetbets,taught me not to ride on the **outside** of the rocket !
2021-06-26 15:07:22,wallstreetbets,I just remembered I have all the good looney toones episodes saved in a drive.
2021-06-26 16:07:34,wallstreetbets,"I’m sorry to break it to all of you but… Classic Looney Tunes wasn’t originally a TV show. It was a series of short films that played before movies in theaters from the 30s through the 60s.

Also… it wasn’t aimed at kids."
2021-06-26 17:20:01,wallstreetbets,Boomerang for the win.  👍
2021-06-26 17:53:09,wallstreetbets,Somewhere about the start of October of 2014 was the first weekend we didn't have true Saturday morning cartoons anymore
2021-06-26 17:56:22,wallstreetbets,Government dictated this.
2021-06-26 18:11:52,wallstreetbets,"Where I live in California we get 3 hours of old Saturday morning cartoons on ME TV (broadcast). It's 7 am Popeye & Friends (think Betty Boop) 7:30 Pink Panther & Friends, 8 Tom & Jerry & Friends and 9 am is Bugs Bunny & Friends for an hour. The child in me delights in Saturday mornings again."
2021-06-26 14:13:22,wallstreetbets,This is why I only let my kid watch Mythbusters these days
2021-06-26 13:10:15,wallstreetbets,My kid isn't 2 yet and Disney junior is what we watch. No comparison to the shit I watched as a kid but Bluey is pretty damn good. Some good hidden adult humor in it too.
2021-06-26 15:02:13,wallstreetbets,"You had 70 upvotes so I downvoted to 69, you’re welcome."
2021-06-26 14:03:28,wallstreetbets,Too racist now.

2021-06-26 14:30:51,wallstreetbets,"There are still some good cartoons that come out every once in a while.

Some that come to mind:  
Phineas and Ferb
  
Adventure Time

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$GSAT GlobalStar analysis (+1,000%) GSAT (Globalstar) is the future of Satellite Communications (GPS) and 5G PT $6.60 2021, $10-15 2022 Here's why: Compare the 5G demand to Straight Path Communications in 2017. There was a vicious bidding war between Verizon and AT&T to acquire the next big 5G telecommunications company, StraightPath. I'm here to tell you history is going to repeat itself in GSAT. Deals with NOKIA and QUALCOMM will catapult this to double digits!!!!!!!!

""Globalstar, Inc. provides mobile satellite services worldwide. The company offers duplex two-way voice and data products, including mobile voice and data satellite communications services and equipment for remote business continuity, recreational usage, safety, emergency preparedness and response, and other applications; fixed voice and data satellite communications services and equipment at industrial, commercial, and residential sites, as well as rural villages and ships; and satellite data modem services comprising asynchronous and packet data services. It also provides SPOT consumer retail products, such as SPOT satellite GPS messenger for personal tracking, emergency location, and messaging solutions; and SPOT Trace, an anti-theft and asset tracking device. In addition, the company offers commercial Internet of Things one-way transmission products to track cargo containers and rail cars, as well as to monitor utility meters, and oil and gas assets. Further, it sells wholesale minutes to independent gateway operators (IGOs); and provides engineering services, such as hardware and software designs to develop specific applications; and installation of gateways and antennas.""

Marketplace: 5G is clearly the future of many industries. Autonomous cars (EV), Cellular, Energy, Agriculture, etc all willsoonrelyon5Gstructuredcommunications. GSATencompassesallofthese. The 5G market alone is expected to be worth over 667 Billion dollars in 5 years. This is not even including the EV space, which relies heavily on secure communications (aka GSAT) The Market is setup for a dominant, trusted company like GSAT to overtake.

Leadership:

David Kagan Chief Executive Officer David Kagan currently serves as CEO of Globalstar. Prior to re-joining Globalstar as President and COO in December 2017, Kagan was the COO of SpeedCast International Limited. He served as President of ITC Global, a premier global VSAT satellite services provider from August 2014 through September 2015. He was also the President and CEO of Globe Wireless from June 2011 through January 2014 when it was sold to Inmarsat PLC.

L. Barbee Ponder IV General Counsel and Vice President of Regulatory Mr. Ponder has previously served as Senior Regulatory Counsel for BellSouth Corporation in Washington, D.C. where he provided representation before the Federal Communications Commission, Congress and the White House on issues concerning 1996

Telecommunications Act, deregulation of broadband services and tax issues concerning the telecommunications industry. Guys...This man worked for the FCC on the telecommunications act in 1996. He knows the regulations and rules behind telecom industry (5G).

Technology, Current Contracts Band53 technology created by GSAT is being used by companies like Nokia and recently Qualcomm. From a press release: ""Globalstar has worked to develop the Band 53 ecosystem with a group of priority partners like Nokia. Globalstar’s Band 53 is a prime mid-band spectrum resource that we offer to our partners for deployment with customers that otherwise would not have access to the benefits of licensed spectrum. The combination of Nokia’s global reach and Globalstar’s Band 53 terrestrial authorizations in multiple countries around the globe present an exciting opportunity for secure wireless solutions."" This technology is the absolute future of secure 5G connections in not only telecommunications, but also in the EV landscape. Yes you heard it right, GSAT already uses their technology in auto makers such as Fiat Chrysler and Jeep. GSAT has the technology to jump fully into the connected car market, especially the ever poipular EV connected car market. GSAT owns 24 ground stations that serve as points between satellites and over 120 countries. The reach is already there. They are only limited by which contracts they will inevitably pick up. See: Nokia, Jeep, Qualcomm. (So far)

Future Growth With the world becoming ever more connected, these smaller but established companies are just waiting to boom. Every partnership that GSAT sees can increase its cap 2-3 fold. Just a basic true evaluation by some analysts see GSAT worth 9.25 Billion (pre Qualcomm deal) which puts them at $6.60 a share at current valuations! If you don't believe me, go look at what Nokia has said about their partnership with Globalstar: https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globalstar-announces-nokia-deployment-over-licensed-band-53-port"

The Starlink constellation is set to make all cell phone technology go obsolete, and already delivering 5G from space, 650 mbps confirmed by US Air Force. And that is the other thing, Starlink satellites have a commercial band and a DoD encryption military band, just like GPS satellites did. (Hint: military is a big customer). SpaceX is launching Starlink on their own, and are minimizing launch costs with used Falcon-9. GSAT will have to contract out for launch services, at premium launch costs.  
  
What is being missed here is Starlink is just flying routers. The server ""trunk line"" is IRDM. The thing to start doing is looking at shorting cell phone companies, Verizon, Sprint, AT&T, Qualcomm, Nokia, they are gone in 10 years."

2021-06-26 12:06:00,wallstreetbets,"BB has been an iconic name for so long. Even nostalgia might bring back the age old ""crackberry"" of yesteryears. Remember, old is new again? But I'm buyng cause of deeper IVY play. TLDR I like the stock. Buying more shares cause I'm an APE."
2021-06-26 12:52:27,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry is hiring 113 high level/skilled positions worldwide, most in the last 21 days, take from that what you will!

2021-06-26 14:37:28,wallstreetbets,"It's funny how people point to BB having a poor present even though they have the brightest future. 

Compare that to a company like AMC who can only make money by raising cash. 

I wouldn't see a problem with BB valued at 2x or 3x it's current price. IVY is going to be a massive revenue stream for them and it's only a few months away from releasing."

2021-06-26 10:12:19,wallstreetbets,Not saying you are wrong or right. But this reads like you pulled a summary paragraph out of a sales pitch.

2021-06-26 11:23:43,wallstreetbets,"You have no idea how clever CEO John Chen. He got Amazon, Geico, Telus, Here, and many others to help accelerate IVY . Created IVY innovation fund and brought on Italy based Electra and bought into SAM , Israel based cybersecurity start up. He is going to make partners with Facebook using the massive patents Blackberry holds. John is HK American with Chinese ancestry. He is a huge advantage when it comes to China, the world biggest Auto market. Understanding the Chinese culture and knowing how to do business with them is a big asset. He got all the EV big players in China. Baidu Xpeng . Who isn't partnering with Blackberry these days. John Chen is super smart, farsighted visionary CEO and got Andy Jassey on his side and now GEICO. Geico has 15 million customers and 24 million cars insured."

2021-06-26 19:42:35,wallstreetbets,I never read the DD and ALWAYS go straight to the comments to figure out if it's basically good news or not.
2021-06-26 10:58:45,wallstreetbets,Is BB another one of these bigly shorted stonks?
2021-06-26 15:06:08,wallstreetbets,is there a BB to amc treytrades or gme roaringkitty youtuber that has high conviction value?
2021-06-26 11:06:03,wallstreetbets,""" GEICO is excited to be BlackBerry IVY’s insurance partner. The companies have a shared vision to accelerate the transformation of the transportation industry,” said Yang Yu, Chief Data and Analytics Officer at GEICO. “By working together as part of our founding role on the new IVY Advisory Council, we plan to introduce Geico products to improve customer service and deliver personalized discounts.

Except making money, they seem to have trouble with that part.

2021-06-26 14:23:22,wallstreetbets,Does that mean there is a chance that Fb could just buy blackberry?
2021-06-26 12:16:45,wallstreetbets,Fck BBerry.  They need to start EARNING some money or improve their margins.  LT I understand the play but GD turn this ship around 😂😂
2021-06-26 15:01:46,wallstreetbets,The potential here for BB to become a significant player again is real. The analysts are shortsighted and risk adverse.
2021-06-26 11:14:29,wallstreetbets,"So BB will be down another 5% next week then? Good I guess, buy more"
2021-06-26 11:21:29,wallstreetbets,"BB ivy is a partnership with AWS using AWSs ML algos to generate common vehicle signals from hex values to things humans can read. They’re doing nothing different than samsara , geotab and other players. Second , vehicle OEMs are starting to get smart to this and thus are offering their own telematics services directly to the cloud. BB misses the boat on this , this tech is 20 years old at this point."

2021-06-26 12:22:51,wallstreetbets,Ain’t nobody got time for that!
2021-06-26 18:27:01,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't necessarily say it's not going well, so much as that they've got a long ways to go until they're a major company again - and their stock is honestly pretty overvalued given what they are right now.

They'll probably eventually be worth what they are now and then more, but it's weird to see that it has a similar market cap as the company I work for, when our company pulls in 5 times as much revenue."
2021-06-26 14:26:34,wallstreetbets,Blackberry invented the BBM instant messenger. They invented the smart phone. They invented the pager. They have over 2000 new technology parents approved recently and have 500 more patents all new pending. They just patented refuelling mechanism for self driving cars. Blackberry is an innovation icon. Just won an award for technology innovation by Frost & Sullivan for 2021. BB IVY also won an innovation award.
2021-06-26 14:05:29,wallstreetbets,The company is growing and therefore they are on a hiring spree. John Chen said during earnings call that they increasing the salesforce and foot on the ground by 23%
2021-06-26 14:05:59,wallstreetbets,Excellent post. Thanks for sharing.
2021-06-26 18:16:56,wallstreetbets,"John Chen and Andy Jassey are building a team 
IVY Advisory Council is by invitation only. They have big plans and they are far ahead of Apple and Google in the software defined smart car ecosystem. They have been working on IVY for years before they announced it. There only 6 months until the roll out.already have customer wins."
2021-06-26 11:34:35,wallstreetbets,"This is John Chen statement from earnings transcript for BB Q1 FY 22 on June 24, 2031 
Very impressive customer wins. Growth is certainly coming."
2021-06-26 14:32:05,wallstreetbets,"Just look at the huge list of customer wins mostly government contracts US and Canadian government. And heavily regulated industries. I posted the list by John Chen from the earnings transcript for Q1 FY 2022 on Jan 24, 2021

The list is mind blowing."
2021-06-26 11:29:56,wallstreetbets,He was also on BNN this week.
2021-06-26 11:27:14,wallstreetbets,When was this? Thanks.
2021-06-26 13:47:28,wallstreetbets,Cnbc and bnnbloomberg canada yesterday.  Bnn was the best interview...must watch.
2021-06-26 17:21:49,wallstreetbets,"The way overpaid CEO whom, based on his salary alone, probably sunk the stock a dollar when it hit the news?"
2021-06-26 11:13:02,wallstreetbets,"Wake up. Blackberry turnaround time is over. Allianz Asset Magement recently bought 27 million Blackberry shares. This vote of confidence by instituonal Investors confirms that Blackberry turnaround is complete. Institutional investors are buying in John Chen's strategy and believe in ability to execute the turnaround plan. This is going to make history. Blackberry 's fall from its glory was one of biggest in the tech world. Now it's turnaround is going to be taught at Harvard Business School. John Chen is going to be the turnaround artist who not only saved Pyramid Technology and Sybase but also made Blackberry iconic again. 
If you read the earnings transcript, you can see a massive list of customer wins mostly government and regulated industries. US government contracts and Canadian government contracts. Blackberry is going to shine. It's back in the spotlight. Primecap Vanguard Allianz Asset Magement Fairfax Financial JP Morgan all holding Blackberry shared and so should you."
2021-06-26 11:15:08,wallstreetbets,"Also, there's not really anything new compared to 6 months ago, or a single source?"
2021-06-26 12:52:45,wallstreetbets,"This is a good point re: China. Though irrespective of his background, I wonder how you can sell cyber security in a country that wants ""all-access"". The CCP has already been pressuring Tesla on some front, so I will be curious to see how this will play out for BB..."
2021-06-26 11:56:10,wallstreetbets,"My estimate is 100 by end of 2023 And an aquisition by Amazon in 2023-2024 

Hold long term."
2021-06-26 14:39:22,wallstreetbets,Maybe by end of 2022 bruh
2021-06-26 17:34:59,wallstreetbets,It could have been me but I don't do youtube. Oh well!
2021-06-26 13:54:58,wallstreetbets,Only close to a billion a year
2021-06-26 10:47:28,wallstreetbets,"I like shares, personally."
2021-06-26 19:25:04,wallstreetbets,"Shares. This is a long play, not a flipper imo."
2021-06-26 10:47:12,wallstreetbets,"I have 2 calls expiring 7/2 that im losing money on.

From what I keep reading all over WSB, BB is a LONG term hold (2-5 years). I would personally suggest stock, but if you want calls go long (possibly LEAPS)"
2021-06-26 11:15:01,wallstreetbets,Only shared. Buy and hold into 2023 Amazon may acquire BB at the end of 2023 even John Chen is going to retire after 10 years at Blackberry. Options expire worthless 97% of the time. Time works against you.
2021-06-26 18:21:04,wallstreetbets,"Facebook paid massive money for WhatsApp. 
They have to wrestle Blackberry from Amazon and Geico. It's not exactly that easy. Jeff , Mark and Warren all don't have cash flow problem. 
Not yet. John Chen wants a legacy. In 2023 possible and Amazon is more likely because of IVY"
2021-06-26 14:16:32,wallstreetbets,"I understand your frustrations. I have been holding BB shares for seven years. I bought my first share shortly after CEO John Chen took over. I thought this was going to take 3 months to turnaround. I learned the hard way and I now realize that technology turnaround takes a long time, sickening patience. What I want you to do is to go on Yahoo Finance. Look up Apple chart and select Max. You will discover that Apple was trapped in a small tight range under 10 for nearly two and half decades. Steve Jobs took seven years to convince the skeptics and the iPhone was introduced in 2007 and only until 2010 that Apple instituonal Investors bought into Steve Jobs vision. From 1985 until 2010
The stock was stagnant. It takes 10 years for a tech company to be fully transitioned from hardware to software. John Chen did a miraculous job and he beat Steve Jobs in Blackberry's turnaround time. I have been holding for seven years. I know I still need three more years before Blackberry becomes iconic again. But it's worth the wait in the end. So be patient. Investing is another way of say the word waiting. And wait. For a long time."
2021-06-26 17:08:28,wallstreetbets,Buy in before they start making money. You'll be laughing in 2023
2021-06-26 18:24:35,wallstreetbets,Look at the impressive customer wins in this quarter. John Chen have a list it's in the earnings transcript. I also posted earlier. It's mind blowing mostly governments in Europe and the US and Canada. Unbelievable.
2021-06-26 11:22:45,wallstreetbets,Just realized I replied to a fucking BB not. God damnit mods clean this shit. Look at this bots post history and spam
2021-06-26 14:31:12,wallstreetbets,"When it goes below $10 again, I’ll buying boatloads of BB shares."
2021-06-26 13:00:57,wallstreetbets,I will hold your shares if you even have any!
2021-06-26 13:25:15,wallstreetbets,"BB IVY already had customer wins, the full roll out is in February 2022 and IVY preview starts this October. Be patient. Turnaround takes time. We are slowly getting back to normal with the pandemic factory shut down is nearly over and we are back in full production at the moment. Chip shortage took a toll on QNX and revenues are down due to IP licensing freeze pending patent sale. In the quarter BB had a significant customer wins mostly government contracts US government and Canadian. If you look at earnings transcript, the customer wins in the quarter is mind blowing. Hold . Be patient."
2021-06-26 17:22:15,wallstreetbets,Which is dope because last year they had 16% higger revenue around the same time which is why they are doing g the highering. I think covid is responsible for that 16% drop. Imagine what the extra sales force and the world normalizing again will do!

2021-06-26 12:20:44,wallstreetbets,"Can’t institutional investors lend their shares out?  

Making investment decisions based on what institutions hold seems risky considering you don’t know what they’re doing or why."
2021-06-26 11:31:57,wallstreetbets,"Cool! I actually am holding BB and have made good money on it. 

Again, you are only stating things as if out of a sales pitch. This contains to little information to be DD. It also does not ask any questions and as such is not appropriate to label ""Discussion"""

2021-06-26 11:30:37,wallstreetbets,How many undergrad business majors did it take to write this comment?
2021-06-26 12:38:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, OP didn't actually say anything other than ""this company is best company because of reasons which I won't define""."

2021-06-26 14:33:51,wallstreetbets,"That’s revenue, not profit. Final quarter of 2021 is when the profits start rolling in and BB moons in 2022!"
2021-06-26 19:55:31,wallstreetbets,Oh good! Love that. Thanks.

2021-06-26 19:58:56,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-06-26 14:28:15,wallstreetbets,The stock market isa  device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. Warren Buffett said. This is correct. It's very true.

2021-06-26 17:53:31,wallstreetbets,This!
2021-06-26 11:33:34,wallstreetbets,"lol @skyhighjake, you may be on to something here! I'm invested in BB but holy shit, BB is the only thing this guy has ever posted about, ever. I'm not one to pounce on someone with low karma or a new account, cause I have both of those things and it's an unfair judgement of one being a bot or not. But this account most definitely stinks bot to the max. Wow."
2021-06-26 16:37:09,wallstreetbets,Cash secured puts at 10-11?
2021-06-26 15:43:21,wallstreetbets,I keep hoping for a big dip too. I bought my current shares at $13. I’d love to buy more at $10.
2021-06-26 17:20:56,wallstreetbets,"How much do interns get paid at BB nowadays? 

(Joke from a quad digit holder)"
2021-06-26 13:40:24,wallstreetbets,"You are right. Here is a question for you. BB was just downgraded . Do you think Allianz Asset Magement made a big mistake buying 27m Blackberry shares just recently. Prior to that JP Morgan picked up a few million shares. What exactly Geico which is an insurance company doing with Blackberry. Geico recently joined IVY advisory council and said that they are excited about  IVY acceleration. Is IVY going to fail. Amazon AWS and Geico are wasting time partnering with Blackberry. ? Who isn't partnering with Blackberry these days and why. Exactly why the FOMO and suddenly every one seems excited to join in . At least on the new BB IVY advisory council. 

Thank for your comments. I honestly appreciate it especially if it's a critical comment. We are here to learn from one another. Share ideas. Question things"
2021-06-26 12:56:33,wallstreetbets,"It reads like someone who never actually finishes their business degree but is a teller at a pay day loan shop and tells dates they are a partner at a financial institution. Whenever people correct them, they humbly remind them that they are in fact business major and are therefore superior."
2021-06-26 13:35:46,wallstreetbets,"Right, but my concern still applies to their IoT offerings/EVs as it pertains to China. Though I don't know enough about it technically to know if it's an issue re: maintaining confidentiality over their IP."
2021-06-26 13:31:10,wallstreetbets,"Not now. In 2023 towards the end or on 2024 John Chen didn't best the company this far too sell it after seven years of hard work and leave without having explosive growth, phenomenal earnings. He wants to leave lagecy and be remembered as the turnaround artist who saved Blackberry and made it iconic again."
2021-06-26 13:57:46,wallstreetbets,"At Sybase John Chen turnaround took 10 years. He collaborated with SAP, German software giant for years before SAP aquisition of Sybase for 65 a share of 50% over trading price at the time of the aquisition. This may be Sybase 2

2021-06-26 14:43:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure we are communicating effectively. I'm not saying I think BB will fail. I'm saying that I don't understand why YOU think it is a good investment and what you see it doing as an organization. 

Only thing I've gotten from what you've said is that we should expect BB to do well because big businesses have invested and they wouldn't invest unless it was going to succeed. That is incredibly flawed logic."

Edit to add: google doesn’t give me 🚀, 🦍, or 🌈🐻 emojis when I search."

2021-06-26 19:27:55,wallstreetbets,"Haha I totally dunno what they are but think I did find the answer and cannot confirm nor be denied because other research has suggested we cant name it. I do, however, believe I have bought FDs. Actually I'm not sure because it seems its limited to the week of (is that too much info?) And I think the few OTMs I've bought were at least the week prior. So maybe through evasive language someone can come along and confirm that I didnt."

For these to be profitable for more than 1 trading day wish needs get above $20. Don’t listen to these apes that don’t understand options at all, the IV is disgustingly high with minimal theta. If you want to do well with FD’s you need to buy weeklies when you think it’s gonna pop. Not just think you are being smart by buying overvalued itm calls a few months out. And just to give you an idea. If Wish does explode to $20-25 you may get a 150% gain. You might aswell take the Mets w degrom pitching"

So if he exercised the options, he’s paying $1,400.00 per contract plus his premium of $3.xx a share.  So the premium cost per share get added into the base cost of each share.  Hence $17.xx a share.

2021-06-26 09:45:37,wallstreetbets,"LOL. “Smug option sellers” relax bro I did make a killing off selling naked $25 MVIS calls. Legit 2k a option, that’s not being smug. That’s noticing a stock has gone from $10-30 in a week for absolutely no reason and seeing this story 1000x before"

2021-06-26 11:08:01,wallstreetbets,https://imgur.com/gallery/ZozpPef I went back to look here’s a screenshot $25 calls on a $27 stock were selling for $7.75 that’s comincal but Myb I was wrong I exaggerated. The $40 call was $2.85
2021-06-26 10:24:44,wallstreetbets,On TD I think you need level 4 option trading. I know you can’t on Robinhood
2021-06-26 10:47:15,wallstreetbets,Why not buy calls to cover your naked calls  in case it does rip? That way you don’t have unlimited loss risk?Personally that is extremely risky. That’s how I have been making money. I buy deep ITM calls and sell weekly OTM calls usually for about 100 dollar premium rinse and repeat
2021-06-26 10:59:43,wallstreetbets,All I do to naked short is “sell a call” and I receive the premium. And I eventually buy that same call option back before expiration for hopefully cheaper than what I got for selling it. Really simple. As you can see though. You can make a lot if you sell at super high IV’s that the stock won’t naturally maintain
2021-06-26 11:13:32,wallstreetbets,"I do the same.  You can make a killing right now with the IV of these memes.  I dont buy deep nor do I sell naked.  Most brokers apply serious factors to nakeds using up your margin account rather quickly.

I buy and sell ATM or a bit ITM calls weekly churning stocks sometimes regularly.  If it drops, your adjusted value due to premiums usually covers it.  Then you sell the next week the CC you want and can leave a little upside.  4-7% weekly aint bad.

I do have my plays as well, dont get me wrong.  Part of the portfolio on plays, part on generating income."

2021-06-26 14:01:14,wallstreetbets,"Well I reckon Airlines which are dinged up just a little might explode once crude and brent drops as its thick like ticks on a dogs back. That and labor are its biggest expenses. 

Labor slashing and a hike in prices and a 9% April passenger increase over March could be a little horny for airlines and might make it as pretty as a shiny red pickup with a good spare tire. 

$jets is sitting at strong February 2021 demand zone as we speak other wise next really strong demand zone is $21.46

Something to monitor just down the road specially if we set back some brent or crude

I don't see anything but the upside here like WKHS 40% short interest now holding over15.5 could spike to 300 a share if wallstreetbets would get behind it. Ppl are holding shorts are not Able to drop it below 15.00.

I feel like wall street bets is the hedge funds shorting stuff and all the people who do what they say are just feeding that pig so they can profit.

I've herd of 100s of people getting 90 day bans for mentioning WKHS.... on here now that's pretty hard censor ship. It's like fb level censor going in to the election. Makes me think this is a joke!"

Nokia Target at Wall Street High as Goldman Likes 5G-Spending Prospects

Goldman Sachs upgraded Nokia stock, 'factoring in a better 5G spending backdrop, wireless product progress and [market]-share gain potential.'

Nokia  (NOK) shares rose on Friday after Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval upgraded the communications equipment company to buy from neutral.


He raised his price target to $6.50 from $4.90, giving him the highest target of analysts tracked by Bloomberg.

Duval said he’s “factoring in a better 5G spending backdrop, wireless product progress and [market]-share gain potential.”

Nokia recently traded at $5.53, up 7.5%. It has surged 42% over the past six months.

“Nokia has underperformed peer Ericsson ERIC by 75% (and European tech by 67%) in the last three years,” Duval said. 

That’s due to “lagging wireless equipment product quality, share losses and negative earnings-per-share revisions. However, we see scope for upside.”


First, “wireless market demand continues to improve, driven by 5G,” he said.

Second, “there is evidence that Nokia’s wireless base-station product position for 5G is improving, suggesting they can regain their place as a key tech enabler for cellular connectivity.”

And third, “we see scope for [market]-share gains from Chinese vendors such as Huawei, especially in Europe,” Duval said.

Nokia’s first-quarter earnings beat analyst expectations. Revenue increased 3% to 5.08 billion euros ($6.16 billion), beating analysts' forecast of $4.74 billion.


Net income totaled $451.5 million, or about 7 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus estimate of 1 cent a share.

In March, Nokia unveiled a five-year deal with AT&T  (T)  to help expand the telecom giant's 5G network coverage in the U.S.

Under the agreement, Nokia will provide its latest fifth-generation equipment to power 5G on AT&T’s C-Band network."

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Intel “23 Itm calls I did some DD on intel.  Compared to the other +100b semiconductor companies, intel is like a nice juicy milf with double D”s in a room of Amateur AMD A cups and Flat chested Nvidia anal addicts.  I was going to buy today but my wife put me on timeout before market close.  I like intel.                                               
 I think that the compatibility with windows 11 will help intel a lot and it reinforces intel as a provider for PC hardware.  Even if amd and tsmc comes up with smaller transistors, intel can still manage to develop more efficient architecture in both transistors per mm^2 and speed.

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SPCE UPSIDE SPCE: 

This is my own research and I pulled multiple financial and proxy data points from a variety of sources. Please do your own DD before investing.  Virgin Galactic (SPCE) went public Via SPAC several years ago, one of the first, and has had extraordinary volatility. The stock had huge downward selling pressure in February, March, and April as Chamath, Branson, and Ark Cleaned out large stakes they had in the firm. The goal of Virgin Galactic is supposed to make air travel to the end of the earth’s atmosphere a commercialized experience for all. The FAA clearance today was a very big catalyst for the firm. 

Currently by my estimations Virgin Investments Limited Owns = 62,403,260 Shares

 Chamath owns = 15,750,000 

Shares SCH Sponsor Corp = 23,750,000 Shares Management = 1,719,854 

Shares Total = 103,623,114 Chamath Sold = 6,200,000 

Shares in March Branson (Virgin Investments LTD) Sold = 5,584,000 Shares in April 

Net = 91,839,114 

Float = 236,944,263 – 91,839,114 = 145,105,149 

Shares Short Interest as of May 28th = 45,920,000 or SI % of Float 31.6% 

Interesting renaissance Technologies has taken a 2.8 million share position. 

&#x200B;

Virgin galactic has said in their own investor presentations they believe that they could have 400 flights per year at any spaceport. There are six seats per flight or 2400 passengers per year. Current Prices for the 600 reservations sold were $200,000 – $250,000. However, the CEO thinks that prices could eclipse 1 million dollars as demand could be high for ultra-high net worth individuals and limited supply of options for space travel. There are 2,755 Billionaires in the world, Also SpentMoney.com said that they estimate 1,456,336 households, in the us, have a net-worth higher than 10 milllion dollars in the US not globally. Pew research found in a study that 42% of people are definitely interested in going to space. If we assume that those numbers would average across both the Billionaires and households above 10 million dollars we see that there are 1.459\*.42 = 612,818 people who can afford to go to space that would want to.

I think that FOMO once the safety is proven of the trip will cause prices to rise on tickets and more people to want to go overtime as it becomes a theme park like experience similar to Disney world or a similar experience like Hamilton became on Broadway. 

612,818.22 / 2400 = 255.34 spaceport years to service TAM of people. 

Even with limited competition from Blue Origin and others there is large demand for this trip especially when you think about business events taking important clients on a once in a life time event trip. 

Assumption $200,000 a seat \*2400 people = 480 million in sales a year for a spaceport (in beginning) $1,000,000 a seat \* 2400  = 2,400,000 Billion in sales from a spaceport per year. 

I don’t believe there is a public comp for a price to sale multiple comparison, but I just wanted to put things into perspective for looking at a long term bullish possibility. I do own a few shares of SPCE :)"

2021-06-26 02:50:59,wallstreetbets,"MU is on track to exceed all expectations for their earnings report on Wednesday. Their earnings report is likely positive for Q3 and leading into Q4, but they will need to prove that their cyclical lows after the current highs can be over-ridden by the huge surge they have been experiencing since pandemic hit.     

Safest strat: Slowly load up on calls expiring on July 2nd and stocks to pump options for short term gains. Sell off calls leading to the earnings report (4:30 EST on Wednesday June 30th which is after market close) and lock in free money and hold a few to YoLo on good earnings report.   

$YoLo STRAT: Load up on calls at open Monday and dump at open Thursday after the (extremely likely to be) positive earnings report on Wednesday after market close.    

I bought 16 calls at market open so I'm going full YoLo$ for after earnings report. Going to post my biggest gains or biggest losses on here next Friday, wish me Luck you stanky Apes ;)    

EDIT: None of this is financial advice, just the ramblings of a drunk and horny Ape looking to win some big bananas. Also, don't blame this Ape if you happen to lose money with your trades. If I'm not entitled to any of your potential gains I want nothing to do with your losses either 😸"

2021-06-26 16:59:07,wallstreetbets,"Just wanted to say,  big thanks to you all, I learn so much from your comments, I truly appreciate it"
2021-06-26 00:44:56,wallstreetbets,Time for puts on bbby again? When is the last time you even went in to one?
2021-06-26 10:06:39,wallstreetbets,MU is so gonna dominated this coming week earnings
2021-06-26 00:35:39,wallstreetbets,"People going back out to eat 

Short McCormick.

That’s free big brain DD for yal"
2021-06-26 08:10:43,wallstreetbets,So many young apes have no idea about Micron. It’s pathetic. Learn your WSB history!
2021-06-26 14:12:01,wallstreetbets,Ammo ($POWW) will be the big winner this week. New contract with Dept. of Defense. Huge increase in gun (what they supply for) sales. Smith and Wesson is up over 50% in two weeks since announcing earnings; Ammo will triple that. This stock is going to the moon as y’all say-
2021-06-26 09:03:22,wallstreetbets,"I don't know anything about the company ammo, but with current bullet prices there is no way they're not profitable."

2021-06-26 08:46:02,wallstreetbets,Thanks for pinning
2021-06-26 09:52:48,wallstreetbets,The 120 calls are cheap just saying
2021-06-26 13:05:02,wallstreetbets,"What's the play off this list, boys?"
2021-06-26 16:18:27,wallstreetbets,Boring as hell but looking forward to McCormicks earnings. I bet it’s 🌶 but maybe even more with reopening.
2021-06-26 19:23:48,wallstreetbets,I think BBBY looks interesting. People like buying stuff for their homes. I don’t shop there much though to be honest. Also watching STZ earnings too but it looks like the chart is peaking out. Probably would be a good play to wait and pick up some shares at $180 or $190 if it dips under $200.
2021-06-26 14:40:42,wallstreetbets,"GIS - General Mills is a sleeping gem here. Been following the stock for awhile, option calls are dirt cheap and IV is still super low. Playing earnings this week on it could be a solid 5x-10x return. Also just a great stock. They had record sales this past year, and are going to be talking about their restructuring of the company at this weeks earnings. They're taking profits and investing in e-commerce. The market/investors love this type of talk. I think I'm gonna post a DD on it soon."
2021-06-26 11:54:40,wallstreetbets,livexlive...100% analysts have buy ratings. Never heard of it.  OTM Calls?

2021-06-26 11:58:05,wallstreetbets,"Either BBB puts, or ammo calls. Need to learn more about livexlive. Pretty lackluster week. Might just run 1 week OTM Wish calls this week. Maybe some OTM pot stock calls with all the legalization hype. Will not be an eventful week of earnings."

And I'm still believing in CeMex because of its zero emissions patent and Bidens infrastructure plans, bought at 6.50, moving to 7.50. 


I do believe that those two have tremendous potential but are more of a long game."
2021-06-26 14:16:08,wallstreetbets,If I remember correctly BBBY missed earnings last summer and offered a huge rebound play after tanking after earnings… going to have to pull that up when I get back tomorrow
2021-06-26 16:15:04,wallstreetbets,Loading up on Fud how so just calls otm?
2021-06-26 19:12:58,wallstreetbets,I was considering MU but it’s kind of in between a downtrend and a reversal breakout. Will have to see how earnings go. Someone selling tons of $95 calls for January.

2021-06-26 03:38:35,wallstreetbets,What strike price?

it's time to take it back 10x"

2021-06-26 10:24:16,wallstreetbets,MU Imo should be around 84+ after ER it got sold off because of algos reading the downgrade even though they had their target as 100$.
2021-06-26 10:14:49,wallstreetbets,MU made me some money as well. I forgot all about it's meme days. I still hold a share or two lol
2021-06-26 09:43:53,wallstreetbets,Whatever happened to the MU DD guy?
2021-06-26 13:04:27,wallstreetbets,What is FD?

2021-06-26 14:14:58,wallstreetbets,"I was looking at it last week.  I want to like it, but I don't think it's big enough to jump on a good ER.  I'm still a little torn.  I may throw something at it and see what happens, but I'm not gonna go all-in."
2021-06-26 12:39:23,wallstreetbets,Same. I made a few million off it the past year with relatively long dated calls.
2021-06-26 02:36:26,wallstreetbets,I visit a BB&B inside the mall by my house all the time but never end up buying anything. A majority of their products are excessive novelties. The store is usually pretty empty despite the huge economic booms and recent reopening of malls which is a terrible sign for potential sustained growth when inflation hits for novelty stores like BB&B. PUTS = free money
2021-06-26 01:45:45,wallstreetbets,When I needed to use the bathroom and the only other clean one was the other side of the mall.

2021-06-26 16:11:54,wallstreetbets,So whats calls do you think you will get? I'm new to options.
2021-06-26 18:58:06,wallstreetbets,Could you expand on the restructuring?
2021-06-26 12:23:30,wallstreetbets,MU??????? lameboy

2021-06-26 08:45:56,wallstreetbets,"When is their earnings report? Also, is this just the DOW, or does it include all US markets for what they’re listing? I’m spit-balling here and have no real clue."
2021-06-26 19:40:23,wallstreetbets,The was the obvious play ... depends in hedge funds plan to increase their short position like the prior times. After the run up earlier this year they decreased it 45%.
2021-06-26 12:18:02,wallstreetbets,30-35% SI and good long term prospects. If earnings is beat. It may do a big jump towards $40.
2021-06-26 12:42:51,wallstreetbets,"Just a heads up, prices have already increased during the past week and will likely jump at open on Monday"
2021-06-26 03:49:02,wallstreetbets,"$82 strike for myself, but I would suggest something more OTM ($83-85) since it is almost guaranteed to climb up as Wednesday draws near."
2021-06-26 17:30:03,wallstreetbets,"I suggest you implement the same strategies for your stock holdings unless you're like me and think a market-wide crash is inevitable. My prediction is that the stock price will surge before earnings and rocket after for the short term to eventually settle at a reasonably higher price point than it currently is in the weeks to come. ATH during this earnings surge will likely be at open Thursday with possibilities for Friday depending on traction and the possible gamma squeeze from options being exercised. If you're bullish on the stock longterm and aren't afraid of a market wipe, hold onto your MU stonks til next year since analysts are predicting the stonk to double at highest estimates and hit $90 at the lowest. Good luck!"
2021-06-26 12:16:33,wallstreetbets,"It was a ""meme"", but memes back in the day were actually solid companies with great outlook"
2021-06-26 09:23:04,wallstreetbets,Lost a pretty penny on those MU 90c. Those were the days.
2021-06-26 12:18:09,wallstreetbets,"If you read up about it recently, there's a new price target of around 160, double what it currently is. Expected EPS is much higher this time around as well, people are being very bullish on their prospects and if they can meet it it will soar to 90+."
2021-06-26 13:24:43,wallstreetbets,Outside the money calls that expire in the very near term

Long calls it is!"
2021-06-26 12:32:32,wallstreetbets,Shorts just wannna short. If its SI was under 10% it would be a $40+ stock.
2021-06-26 18:28:57,wallstreetbets,7/16 62.5C. There's some other options depending on your risk tolerance. If  you're new to options just do as much research as possible and maybe keep your initial bets small.

2021-06-26 18:32:53,wallstreetbets,Load up at 77 last week. Sold some last Friday. Plan to buy back after Er this time
2021-06-26 13:49:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but this year if earnings are bad stock goes down.  If earnings are good, stock guess down.

Kind of makes me want to buy some puts but the stock will also do the opposite of whatever I do."
2021-06-26 17:46:16,wallstreetbets,This was a fantastic exchange. Hamster was really spinning on that one. 😂
2021-06-26 13:48:00,wallstreetbets,Yep good new execs from target too reminds me of another stock with good execs taking over the company with high SI
2021-06-26 17:29:21,wallstreetbets,"Oh my God, look at her IV"
2021-06-26 13:59:08,wallstreetbets,I would buy the dip on Monday which usually happens around 10:40 AM EST
2021-06-26 08:34:38,wallstreetbets,"> leaps for eom july

🤔🤔"
2021-06-26 11:00:18,wallstreetbets,I strongly suggest that you stick with my recommendations as my research has led me to believe that the stock price is almost guaranteed to drop in the coming weeks after their earnings report. The price is likely going to peak on Thursday morning at open bar some exciting news they hold onto for Friday of that week. GOOD LUCK
2021-06-26 13:50:40,wallstreetbets,"One ticker to disprove you, NKE. Try harder next time. Buy puts so my stock can go up pls :)."

2021-06-26 12:21:55,wallstreetbets,"Last couple of times they reported a positive EPS, the share rose for a week after, only to be cut short by tech selloffs. I'll be holding till long after the EPS if it's positive."
2021-06-26 11:01:13,wallstreetbets,Oh I’m 100% selling on Wednesday COB or Thursday morning
2021-06-26 15:03:04,wallstreetbets,"No problem! Just letting you know that it is entirely possible that the ""dip"" price may be much higher than  the price you could have potentially locked in at open. I missed a good entry point to plenty of good runs waiting on the dip after open so please don't blame me if you miss out 😆"
2021-06-26 08:44:18,wallstreetbets,"LEAPs are usually considered 1+ year expiration. I mean, granted I'll call my January exp calls LEAPs most of the time, but I'm not sure ""EOM"" qualifies."
2021-06-26 12:28:06,wallstreetbets,Can you elaborate on this? How soon after earnings did the price peak?
2021-06-26 11:03:43,wallstreetbets,"Then you're much better off with calls expiring on July 2nd and not July EOM since the calls will be significantly cheaper than if you were to go for July ""Leaps"" 😺"
2021-06-26 15:07:26,wallstreetbets,Haha…hey if not this I will buy more AAPL shares…
2021-06-26 08:45:43,wallstreetbets,I thought leaps were just the weeklies. But you’re right. I’m a stupid
2021-06-26 12:32:39,wallstreetbets,"[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mu/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mu/earnings), Here are there previous earnings dates. Last two are 3/31/2021 and 1/07/2021. For the 1/07/2021, price peaked afterward around 1/19/2021, two weeks after. There was a huge selloff in the S&P which influenced the market around that time.

 For 3/31/2021, the price peaked on 4/05/2021. This one I'm not entirely sure what caused the shortcomings of this rise, but it did peak at its ATH, and they also announced product news around this time as well. 

Both didn't happen a day after. And with Expected EPS being so much higher, if they beat it, that gives a much bigger bullish sentiment to potentially lift it off to 90+."
2021-06-26 11:15:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you’re probably right, i just like to have some room for peace of mind. Also i was def wrong ab leaps. I thought calling weeklies leaps was kind of weird to begin with"
2021-06-26 14:05:35,wallstreetbets,On Wsb… leaps are weeklies
2021-06-26 12:36:26,wallstreetbets,"Thank you very much for expanding so much!    
That is a great analysis and I would consider holding a week or two if I had shares, but I'm all in with options and I'm still weary of an overall market crash so I'll likely cash out next week."
2021-06-26 11:23:05,wallstreetbets,"That extra time on the call is normally what I would recommend, but in this particular situation your best bet is to open and close call contracts within the same week so you don't pay extra on premiums for that time you don't need. And it's all good, stonks are a bit complicated and we get better at the terms and our trades with practice and time."
2021-06-26 12:37:38,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, have fun making money this week 🚀"
2021-06-26 11:32:30,wallstreetbets,I was mostly thinking about theta screwing me over if the price didn’t go up as high as I hope
2021-06-26 12:38:56,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Good luck with your own plays 😁
2021-06-26 11:43:08,wallstreetbets,"Which is usually a smart consideration, but if a huge catalyst like the earnings report next week isn't enough to hike up the stock price, odds are it won't increase the week after either (in fact, a stagnant stock price immediately post-earnings will likely tank the stock)   

That extra time is not worth that extra premium in this play imo"
2021-06-26 12:12:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah when I think about it, I probably agree with you too. Thanks"
2021-06-26 12:28:39,wallstreetbets,No problem and good luck 🙂

I was also 6'1"" 270lbs and wasn't intimidated when I was in a Baltimore city juvie facility, or when we did the Scared Straight program through Patuxent State Prison.  I was a quiet kid and didn't really go looking for static, but I had already been in a half a dozen fights at that point, including getting jumped by 5 juniors my freshman year of high school and had my head kicked in with steel toes, so I wasn't really all that concerned about violence.

Anyway, I turned my shit around and got it together not long after the scared straight program.  Not because I was so terrified of going to jail and getting raped or beaten.  No, what got to me was the feeling of hopelessness that pervaded the prison.  It was walking through the basketball court at the gym with all the convicts sitting on the bleachers saying shit like ""stay in school"" or ""you don't want to be here"" etc.  It was the talks the inmates who ran the program gave us in private, telling their stories and pleading for us not to make the same mistakes.  It was walking through the yard and watching the other small kids getting mad dogged by the inmates while I was largely left alone, and hearing one of them say ""Damn, big dude looks like he could make it here"", and realizing that I could, and I would have to if I didn't get my shit together.

People take different things from those programs.  Some kids genuinely get so scared they'll do anything to keep from going back, some don't give a shit and end up coming back a few years later.  For me, it was realizing that this was my future, and feeling like I owed it to the inmates that ran the program to get my shit together.  What scared me was knowing in a few years, I'd just be another one of these hopeless guys, locked away and forgotten and fighting to survive every day just to hopefully one day return to the streets with a miniscule chance to ever realize my potential."

I feel bad for these kids too. Some of them never had a chance. Born into poverty, broken homes, neglected, ignored, bullied, etc. This extreme program was to give them a glimpse of what their future would be if they choose to circumvent the laws and live without any moral structure. It’s radical. It didn’t always work. But it saved the lives of some young people. You shouldn’t agree with the treatment here anymore then you agree with people breaking laws. This is a very nuanced and textured approach to tough love. Imperfect. This was the equivalent of “in case of emergency break glass” the tv show was riveting, but also gave other young people a look at what it’s like when shit gets real and no ones coming to save you. It gave them a view of this program without actually having to experience the trauma. Of course ratings were priority but this was a unintended weirdly positive side effect."

I guarantee you this program havent helped anyone, your kidding your self if you think that.  I would bet lots of those young people who hate the police and government etc was properly people who saw this program, or was in this program.

Remember their is a side to it you dont see on TV also.

I spent 30 days in lock up, 3 months on house arrest, and 2 years on probation for it.  I ended up going to Patuxent State Prison in Maryland twice, and then Frederick County Jail, the trauma ward at a hospital, and a meeting with AIDs patients once afterwards.  I did Patuxent twice because I did it once while locked up, and once as terms of probation.

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TGT is criminally undervalued and has a lot of upside potential in these coming months Target is currently trading at around $240 per share. Firstly, I believe it's undervalued based on its price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.58, when compared to its competitors (COSTCO has a P/E of 36.589, Walmart has a P/E of 31.829). A look at the Enterprise value to EBIDTA ratio (EV/EBIDTA) tells a similar story. It should be noted, though, that TGT has a higher debt-to-equity of 1.02 ratio than some Costco and Walmart, although it isn't high enough to raise concerns about its risk. Based on fundamentals alone, it seems like a solid pick.

This is supported by the fact that it absolutely crushed earnings back in April, beating EPS by a whopping 104.36% and revenue by a reasonable 14.24%. It saw a nice pump after earnings was disclosed, but it has still steadily increased in price since then (6.1% in the last month).

I think that it will continue to grow now that summer is here and there is increased shopping, not to mention reopening and lifting of COVID restrictions.

Positions: 50 shares at $225 and two 240c expiring Jan 2022

What do you think about $TGT?"

Target suffers from it's desire to be not-Walmart and wants to try to pay their employees like they're almost people.

Costco doesn't have employees. 75% of the people you see ""working"" at Costco aren't employees. Those sample ladies? Contract employees. The Costco call center? Contract labor. The Verizon booth? Duh. Outside of a manager, a customer service person, a receipt slave, and a few general stock slaves, Costco doesn't have the manpower like Target does. It would take the staff of 3 Costcos to run a Target.

However starting Feb 23rd this year cocaine Jim suddenly became infatuated about Cathie taking shots both on his show and on twitter.  Feb 23rd oddly coincides with the freefall of the ARK etfs.

2021-06-26 09:29:02,wallstreetbets,That retard is mad at cathie because she didn’t give him any pussy
2021-06-26 10:50:36,wallstreetbets,Cathie only invests in super bubbly speculative things. It looks great in a bull run and collapses in a bear run. So Cramer must be expecting a bear market soon.
2021-06-25 23:57:38,wallstreetbets,CNBC hates Cathie and Trump. Two people that don't bullshit you and know what they're doing . Sorry to bring politics into this.
2021-06-25 23:44:37,wallstreetbets,Misogynistic? I’m no Cramer fan but that’s a bridge too far.
2021-06-26 00:41:16,wallstreetbets,"James is into dudes, same as me. Cathie’s man is hotter than Jim’s man; plain and simple."
2021-06-26 06:29:59,wallstreetbets,I am puzzled as to why anyone wants to listen to what that shill says.
2021-06-26 09:16:28,wallstreetbets,The answer to your question is in your post title. He is an idiot.
2021-06-25 23:53:54,wallstreetbets,she’s like the retail whale that keeps averaging down and buys the dip enough to create support. Then wsb comes in and whichever shorts paid him off gets stuck above a certain price. Hilarious
2021-06-26 09:43:36,wallstreetbets,Came here looking for a punchline
2021-06-26 10:11:53,wallstreetbets,She probab
2021-06-26 10:29:48,wallstreetbets,She probably turned him down
2021-06-26 11:18:24,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is just an asshole only a mother could love.
2021-06-26 14:04:22,wallstreetbets,He's trying to tell people to get out of ARK by bashing Cathie herself...
2021-06-26 14:14:51,wallstreetbets,Paid FUD
2021-06-26 15:55:00,wallstreetbets,HEY IM CRAME- shut the fuck up.
2021-06-26 01:18:31,wallstreetbets,Cause she didn’t fuck him?
2021-06-26 01:39:22,wallstreetbets,He’s prolly trying to make money by trading on his tweets like he got busted for before.
2021-06-26 02:25:16,wallstreetbets,Just do the opposite of that fool and you’ll be fine. He’s a short term shill.
2021-06-26 03:51:50,wallstreetbets,Two boomers pumping their own shit. Wonder which one created more bagholders. Where is that “I analyzed” guy?
2021-06-26 08:49:15,wallstreetbets,"Why?  Because he was Told to, & /or he was paid to do so."
2021-06-26 09:17:25,wallstreetbets,Cramer could not trade his way out of a wet paper back.
2021-06-26 13:11:09,wallstreetbets,Prob bc Cathie Wood is a complete hack
2021-06-26 15:31:54,wallstreetbets,It's funny how everyone just concluded all together that Cramer wants to bang Cathie 😂😂😂
2021-06-26 15:33:44,wallstreetbets,"What would Cramer do if Cathie texted him ""come over in wet""?"
2021-06-26 17:53:51,wallstreetbets,"Just to be clear “Cocaine Jim” shouldn’t be an insult, cocaine is loved and cherished on reflective surfaces worldwide. 
I myself am on a diet and only snort climbing chalk, but that’s why we’re all on r/wallstreetbets right?! 🥴"
2021-06-26 19:01:23,wallstreetbets,"Cathie is the next Lehman, y’all can go fuck yourselves with her ETFs"
2021-06-26 09:24:49,wallstreetbets,"Hell yeah, she's a fox"
2021-06-26 08:10:24,wallstreetbets,Calls on the titties
2021-06-26 03:54:26,wallstreetbets,"Her last name isn’t even wood, it’s just a nickname because that happens to us all. Officially she’s Cathy ‘Wood’ Ark."
2021-06-26 09:43:39,wallstreetbets,"He’s like one of those boys, who tries to get the attention of his crush every day in school… only to be ignored."
2021-06-26 09:16:02,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
2021-06-25 22:54:01,wallstreetbets,"Oh I don't care about Jim or his bad advice, I just thought it was funny how he danced on her grave the whole way down and suddenly has gone quiet on her."
2021-06-26 00:44:33,wallstreetbets,He is a horse toothed bandit and a loose stool.
2021-06-26 03:09:22,wallstreetbets,Read a few of his books I wish I could forget. I hated to see the data. I wish he would try like the rest of the people in the trenches.
2021-06-26 01:43:48,wallstreetbets,success of Cathie? some people (retards) are still bagholding ARKK after trying to “invest” (buying shares is gay btw). ig that’s still marginally better than the retards who thought it was a good idea to buy COIN at the top alongside her though.
2021-06-26 15:31:05,wallstreetbets,"He has defended this sub before though (""they like the stock"")"
2021-06-26 00:45:30,wallstreetbets,"Her media appearances are actually watchable and educational, while his sound like a broken windmill"
2021-06-26 03:13:02,wallstreetbets,I don’t like the guy either but you are wrong about Tesla he loves the shit out of Tesla.
2021-06-26 01:12:54,wallstreetbets,Puts or sell calls on Cramer’s marriage? What should I do bros?
2021-06-26 16:58:14,wallstreetbets,He still hits the girls he likes
2021-06-26 15:51:44,wallstreetbets,"Well, you don't get more old boys club than a boomer who rose the ranks while working on Wall Street."
2021-06-26 15:47:30,wallstreetbets,"I like the transparency that is built into her funds.  I certainly don't always agree with her or like all ARK purchases, but I feel her general approach of favoring disruptive tech is certainly the right road to be on.

And while she might be wrong at times in the past or again in the future, she's not making ""wild assumptions"", IMO.  She shares her reasoning for her rationale.  If you disagree, that's fine... but she's not just doing random shit"
2021-06-26 16:57:22,wallstreetbets,"God knows the future, asshole!"
2021-06-26 18:11:33,wallstreetbets,People say this just hate themselves for not buying it five years earlier and make that 500% return!
2021-06-26 00:23:53,wallstreetbets,As mama Cathie said: nothing changed except the price. It’s an opportunity to buy the dip!
2021-06-26 14:35:04,wallstreetbets,"Thanks Jim, it's also up like 20% from the low a couple months back."
2021-06-26 01:42:49,wallstreetbets,Yeah trump knew he was a fascist pig.
2021-06-25 23:58:53,wallstreetbets,And Cathie was for Trump so that's another reason they hate her.
2021-06-26 15:59:16,wallstreetbets,"I'm not one that jumps to those sorts of conclusions easily, but it has definitely felt that way at times watching Cramer and some others jerk off on TV while covering ARK losses.  Fwiw, there's also not much that screams boys club louder than boomer wall street."
2021-06-26 19:10:46,wallstreetbets,"She should make an onlyfans, true GILF"
2021-06-26 10:41:41,wallstreetbets,"Just Competition, Challenge and Fiction !!!

Most important is to get profit and go to the moon !!

This is the way!

2021-06-26 15:28:51,wallstreetbets,"ROFL


She is 😏"
2021-06-26 15:14:21,wallstreetbets,Puts on her… wait I can’t say that
2021-06-26 03:53:46,wallstreetbets,He is Louis CK with all of the masturbating and none of the jokes.
2021-06-26 03:57:56,wallstreetbets,"Wait, what?! I would understand reading one of his books, but you read more than one?! Are you an intellectual masochist?"
2021-06-26 08:11:11,wallstreetbets,ARKK is up 78% in 1 year...
2021-06-26 00:50:48,wallstreetbets,She also shits herself less...
2021-06-26 16:56:27,wallstreetbets,Good comments gameover
2021-06-26 18:35:19,wallstreetbets,God doesn't exist so...
2021-06-26 18:39:44,wallstreetbets,"People say this just hate themselves for not buying TSLA and SHOP five years earlier and making that 4,500% return. Best of luck with your high expense ratio ETF investing."
2021-06-26 15:54:41,wallstreetbets,she also said the correction was coming a month or two before
2021-06-26 07:48:38,wallstreetbets,"Are u freakin kidding? Hate to talk trump here but CNBC supported him 1000%, what u think now CNBC is BLM or Antifa or grew a brain?"
2021-06-26 08:50:13,wallstreetbets,That is an apt description!
2021-06-26 04:00:16,wallstreetbets,I hate myself. My dad also got me into stocks. I regret it all. At least I know how to lose money though.
2021-06-26 12:26:28,wallstreetbets,ARKK is down in 2021 because cathie keeps making turbo retarded plays. turns out it’s not that great of an ETF when TSLA isn’t a multibagger and that there aren’t many random 2020 tech pumps LOL
2021-06-26 00:58:15,wallstreetbets,Yea if you can get through all of Cathie’s “umms” …
2021-06-26 13:14:44,wallstreetbets,"I agree, I have never made this connection before, but it’s scary how similar they are."
2021-06-26 15:16:28,wallstreetbets,Is that you Brandon Beavis?
2021-06-26 13:57:47,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, long-term holds don't work over 6 month time-frames.  It's up 78% in a year and 537% in 5 years.  Talk to me in another 5 years, and then you can say with confidence she doesn't know what she's doing if it hasn't beaten the market in the last 5 years.  If it has beaten the market, even by a few percent, that's more than most funds can say."
2021-06-26 01:41:13,wallstreetbets,"Trick is to train yourself to say “Well…” instead of um, makes you sound like you’re smart and just thinking."
2021-06-26 01:15:13,wallstreetbets,"Her ""umms"" are some good jack off material but I guess not everyone is into such kink"
2021-06-26 14:18:14,wallstreetbets,She just went all-in on tech when all the new money flowed in. It's a good time to be a trend rider but she's not psychic
2021-06-26 14:24:03,wallstreetbets,ok bro. keep buying into supposed ETFs “long term holding” retarded shit like PLTR and COIN. ill stick to my QQQ and SPY when i retire so i dont have to worry about a fund manager treating an ETF like its their own personal robinhood yolo account and doing shit like doubling down on shitty tickers as they’re nosediving.
2021-06-26 02:18:59,wallstreetbets,Trick is to train yourself to say “Duuuude” instead of “um” so that everyone underestimates you.
2021-06-26 14:22:58,wallstreetbets,"I didn't say she's a genius or that it took rocket science for those gains.  God knows there are some retards on here that have made a fortune, too.

All I did was say she's been successful.  And right now that's still a true statement.  In 5 years, maybe not.  We'll see, one day."
2021-06-26 03:24:19,wallstreetbets,The trick is to be smart and interesting and say things that are meaningful (like Cathie) instead of blathering nonsense like a drunken Cramer asshole (like Cramer).
2021-06-26 03:55:38,wallstreetbets,You can also use ‘Senator…’
2021-06-26 07:46:18,wallstreetbets,"Or congressman, thank you for that question.. when I was a boy in Bulgaria."
2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,The pain bros. The PAIN.

2021-06-25 22:17:05,wallstreetbets,"You got shares, you'll be fine"
2021-06-25 23:54:50,wallstreetbets,Bought bb at $24… became a long term trade
2021-06-25 23:35:32,wallstreetbets,"Welcome, BBagholder"
2021-06-26 01:24:43,wallstreetbets,Dont be a pussy. Just hold it. You will be fine. You don't loose money unless you get out of the market. If you need some inspiration just look at the SPCE. You are good.
2021-06-26 10:18:55,wallstreetbets,"The more loss porn I see for a ticker, the more I think, “is NOW a good time to buy?”"
2021-06-25 22:28:49,wallstreetbets,19% ain’t nothing. I lose 19% of my body weight every time I take a shit.
2021-06-26 03:51:02,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry, it will moon on Monday because I gave up and sold again.

You can thank me later. 😔"
2021-06-25 23:55:53,wallstreetbets,Join the fam my fellow Blackberry believer  cause we're on the same boat as you
2021-06-26 03:40:54,wallstreetbets,"Feel ya bruh, I FOMO'D in at 19.8$ but managed to avg. down to 14.6$. We will all be fine, not even worried. BB have so much going on that any day we might get some great news that will turn this boat around."
2021-06-26 06:06:46,wallstreetbets,"BB has a lot going on for them this is not something you sell at a loss.  Plus in general the stocks are switching from recovery season (cake) to tech season which is good news for BB, apple, google, amd etc. say the next 6 months.  Tech earnings for Q2, Q3 will be good.  Even if ur desperate short term just hold a few more months for the rebound and you'll likely profit.  But really BB is a long play too so up to you if u got the heels to dig in and stay a while I would.  If you sell now you're doing it wrong, but dont ask me I'm not a sexpert and this is not financial lube."
2021-06-25 22:20:33,wallstreetbets,F
2021-06-26 00:11:46,wallstreetbets,Are shorts shorting this stock. Anyone have any idea in the short %.
2021-06-26 03:08:16,wallstreetbets,I bought the dip
2021-06-25 23:06:15,wallstreetbets,Not a loss til you sell
2021-06-25 23:03:34,wallstreetbets,"Feeling you brother, hopefully you have been at least selling CCs."
2021-06-26 02:48:57,wallstreetbets,17.33 avg with total 8000 😭
2021-06-25 22:26:20,wallstreetbets,Stop worrying you'll be fine - sell some covered calls lower your costs... move into the storage space under the stairs...
2021-06-25 22:45:58,wallstreetbets,Same pain! -21.24%
2021-06-25 23:17:15,wallstreetbets,"-32.5%. the way i see it, i’ll pay less taxes when the train finally leaves the station 😅."
2021-06-25 23:56:06,wallstreetbets,Bah I lost 22g on calls just like that on bb shares are fine just hold bro
2021-06-26 08:14:58,wallstreetbets,Ok but what about BBs new digital car?
2021-06-25 22:19:11,wallstreetbets,Should have invested in palm pilot.
2021-06-26 01:42:29,wallstreetbets,It's not a loss until you sell. You gotta buy low (or when it dips) in order to sell high. At least you're not doing the options and contracts stuff.
2021-06-26 03:43:24,wallstreetbets,"Bboys, Why we don‘t focus on the bberry that our visa card gets bblack?"
2021-06-26 08:43:46,wallstreetbets,"Got my 330 shares @10,70 so Im still in the green. I held through the 20 spike but Im not regretting not selling, I firmly believe in a higher price"
2021-06-26 09:51:38,wallstreetbets,"There 're people that bought in January for $20+ and held a bag at $8. We will have to sit this one out for some time, enjoy the ride and buy the dip retard."
2021-06-26 10:32:59,wallstreetbets,Legend has it there is a BBagholder that bought in June 2008 for \~$150
2021-06-26 15:15:54,wallstreetbets,"At least you have shares and not calls. It'll come back at some point. Try to go outside this weekend, maybe do some meditation. Maybe some cocaine. Try not to dwell."
2021-06-26 16:19:44,wallstreetbets,"I legit can't understand how this stock tanked so hard based on their earnings call, there was so much good long term news...."
2021-06-25 22:42:11,wallstreetbets,Positive 58K in a year. Wouldn’t worry about this position.
2021-06-25 22:21:22,wallstreetbets,Only down 19%? You still have so far to go.
2021-06-25 22:25:50,wallstreetbets,Down 26%. Nothing but a thing. 🐝🐝
2021-06-25 23:08:05,wallstreetbets,"I really thought it was going to run at the end of the day today, but they monkey hammered it again."
2021-06-26 03:29:04,wallstreetbets,You will still be under your cost basis next week. Have faith my son.
2021-06-26 15:53:39,wallstreetbets,Sigh…. Maybe next quarter guys. See you in 3 months
2021-06-25 23:13:30,wallstreetbets,What do you mean. You can buy yourself a mansion and some alligators down in Mississippi with what you have left over.
2021-06-26 08:35:29,wallstreetbets,"Sheesh, that's why you don't buy BB calls unless you have some inside knowledge and long in the position. I mean you can even look at the 1 year chart and deduce its not a good play.  If you have any equity left, i'd cash out and put the remainder in shares. Blackberry will pop, It's just a matter of catalysts and time.

For this company's tech to be in so many cars, the active partnerships they have, and the price still has not jumped $20+ consistently is fucking ridiculous."
2021-06-26 00:28:20,wallstreetbets,Bro all those sweet covered calls!
2021-06-26 01:03:16,wallstreetbets,Just average down until you break even bro.
2021-06-25 22:17:30,wallstreetbets,[deleted]

2021-06-26 00:22:12,wallstreetbets,Ouch
2021-06-26 02:45:37,wallstreetbets,You basically could’ve bought my dream car with this L
2021-06-26 09:11:08,wallstreetbets,"Popped in at 18, so regardless, will be holding for some time."
2021-06-26 10:34:12,wallstreetbets,You can blame citadel for the pump and dump
2021-06-26 11:03:48,wallstreetbets,Sell some covered calls on those even if they are high.  Looks like you're in at 15.  Generates some extra premiums.  Just be comfortable with the price in case they get called.
2021-06-26 11:17:43,wallstreetbets,"I sold mine for about a 20% loss Friday. I'm sure it will rebound  eventually, but I think I can make it back and more by the time it does rebound. I'll buy back in around 2022"
2021-06-26 11:32:06,wallstreetbets,You bought shares not options you have a huge chance of making money back plus some. Options you would lose everything
2021-06-26 15:28:14,wallstreetbets,Patience BBrothers!
2021-06-26 15:33:22,wallstreetbets,You’re not down til you sell.
2021-06-26 16:45:02,wallstreetbets,Yup. When we come out Victory with AMC. Then we'll takecare of BB and WISH. Now we have to conquer AMC first.
2021-06-26 16:54:34,wallstreetbets,"Just keep buying those dips, eventually you’ll profit. Keyword, EVENTUALLY....when it dips as low as it’ll dip, it’ll bounce back up after it hits the floor, then BOOOOOIIIIIIINNNGGGG! Off to TENDIELAND!!"
2021-06-26 17:42:25,wallstreetbets,Bought at $15.51 on a long term assumption and it's actually not that scary.
2021-06-26 17:52:46,wallstreetbets,"20% ?

Relax. 
So you didn’t get a great entry. 
Ain’t nuthin but a thang"
2021-06-26 17:58:25,wallstreetbets,"I'm nowhere near your position, but I'm about to double down again. Been selling weekly OTM calls just above my avg. cost to try to dig my way out. 🦍💎👐"
2021-06-26 18:48:08,wallstreetbets,Down 21% no fucks given.
2021-06-26 18:54:14,wallstreetbets,You be aight

2021-06-26 19:35:40,wallstreetbets,Hold and sell covered calls you will be fine 👍🏼
2021-06-25 22:49:04,wallstreetbets,"Just couldn’t hold, had to sell. 😭
Moving on.  Good luck to all"
2021-06-26 09:39:53,wallstreetbets,I'm still holding! 💎
2021-06-26 11:54:46,wallstreetbets,"I came here to make my feel better about my own pain. Down 70k YTD, which is about 70% of my portfolio. I have sever gambling tendencies. My win ratio is actually good, I accumulate small wins but when I loose. Oh boy, do I fucking loose. Ive concluded my biggest weakness is that I don’t know how take a loss. I classic revenge trade, doubling down, loosing more, getting emotional and frustrated and loosing all logic and throwing money at the most risky options to try to make it back. Sigh."
2021-06-26 00:45:52,wallstreetbets,Almost as bad 9k shares @17. Selling covered calls is helping bring down my cost basis. May buy more shares to lower my cost basis too.
2021-06-26 01:02:06,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-06-26 04:26:45,wallstreetbets,Covered calls for years wooohooo

2021-06-26 09:06:07,wallstreetbets,"Fuck everyone in the comments. I similarly lost on BB in February when I thought I was “buying the dip” at $17 before it crashed to fucking $11. Instead of continuing the to bag hold to eternity, I cut my losses and made it back on other plays. Diamond hands are for suckers."
2021-06-26 03:03:47,wallstreetbets,Lol. It is the fake meme stock. 😂
2021-06-26 07:14:37,wallstreetbets,sell 197 weekly covered calls and hold those bitches til they're worth triple digits next year
2021-06-26 10:12:53,wallstreetbets,"I don't see the upside here like WKHS 40% short interest now holding over15.5 could spike to 300 a share if wallstreetbets would get behind it. Ppl are holding shorts are not Able to drop it below 15.00.

I feel like wall street bets is the hedge funds shorting stuff and all the people who do what they say are just feeding that pig so they can profit.

I've herd of 100s of people getting 90 day bans for mentioning WKHS.... on here now that's pretty hard censor ship. It's like fb level censor going in to the election. Makes me think this is a jokes on you play by dudes with 6 billion scamming u for your 50k"
2021-06-26 03:29:32,wallstreetbets,"Don’t avg down, exit."
2021-06-26 04:44:06,wallstreetbets,That's what happens when you listen to shills. GME/AMC is the play
2021-06-25 23:06:02,wallstreetbets,Pull OUT
2021-06-26 05:32:58,wallstreetbets,Is real
2021-06-26 05:53:14,wallstreetbets,lol only 20% down on 250k? Where are the options? You are being too safe - think of the 0DTE yolo's you could have spent the 60k on
2021-06-26 06:27:42,wallstreetbets,They have too many shares. Stay away
2021-06-26 06:48:59,wallstreetbets,RIP fellow ape 🦍
2021-06-26 07:22:30,wallstreetbets,"Don't listen to me, but does it only show - 20%?"
2021-06-26 09:00:31,wallstreetbets,Join the theta gang and start lowering your cost basis with covered calls! My shares are -20% but I'm only about -5% overall.
2021-06-26 09:29:05,wallstreetbets,Ouch. Typical WSB Ape.
2021-06-26 10:00:37,wallstreetbets,Sell and roll into GameStop
2021-06-26 10:09:09,wallstreetbets,Blackberry phones always sucked.
2021-06-26 10:24:50,wallstreetbets,I have yet to see a hyped stock here actually do anything really good. Not since GME and AMC. Looking like those two were just luck.
2021-06-26 10:55:47,wallstreetbets,Down 70%
2021-06-26 11:17:55,wallstreetbets,Double down on it
2021-06-26 11:26:07,wallstreetbets,Guh

2021-06-26 14:04:26,wallstreetbets,Just buy the right meme stocks and don't be a hedgefund sheep😅 no sympathy
2021-06-26 14:42:04,wallstreetbets,BB has been fucking my eyes out. Easily my worst bet this year. I’m no where near as deep in it as you but it still sucks. Been selling CCs to get something out of it.
2021-06-26 14:53:40,wallstreetbets,"BB hurt more people than any other stocks!!  This trash goes down 2% every single day, I know this cause I held from Jan through April, $20 all the way down to $7.5, it’s the most painful experience any stock trader could ever have, after the second wave of meme surging, I know this trash was gonna spike too, but I also know it’s going back to $8 by the end of July, I know I’ll get a lot of hate for saying this, but be ware of the echo chamber around you."
2021-06-26 14:54:06,wallstreetbets,Oof. Only down ~11% over here
2021-06-26 15:14:13,wallstreetbets,Woulda been nice if it went this way 2 weeks ago when I placed a put. 🤦🏻‍♂️ lolol
2021-06-26 15:14:32,wallstreetbets,"250 shares at 15. Down with you 
Buy more monday is best I can do :-/"
2021-06-26 15:25:17,wallstreetbets,"BB was good when there were only FEW meme stonks. now that it has more than 10 and seeing nasdaq/sp500/dow going all time highs. big institutions will go back trading non meme stonks. cut losses and move on. BB doesnt have revenue growth YoY, it was just hyped."
2021-06-26 15:33:43,wallstreetbets,"Also you’re in BB, tough lesson learned"
2021-06-26 15:33:45,wallstreetbets,"TBH, 20% down is no big deal. Your problem is believing that a long term play would get you massive short term gains. BB has shown that it does not have what it takes right now to sustain $20 even with all the hype. 

It was classic misdirection. I mean, how many times has it been hyped up and then it just collapses? It is the Groundhog Day of stocks."
2021-06-26 15:35:35,wallstreetbets,BB did you dirty.
2021-06-26 16:25:48,wallstreetbets,"That sucks, double up!"
2021-06-26 16:34:25,wallstreetbets,Jump to CLOV
2021-06-26 16:37:43,wallstreetbets,"This was my long term play, but sold @ $16 because there’s other plays to be in right now. Going to buy back later because $BB is the future and not a meme stock."
2021-06-26 16:38:53,wallstreetbets,im holding bag @ 14
2021-06-26 16:47:29,wallstreetbets,For BB ..those executives are getting paid ridiculously high wages. Gotta get that shit straightened out too. Then the company will take off.
2021-06-26 17:14:42,wallstreetbets,I told u guys to sell didn’t I
2021-06-26 17:18:59,wallstreetbets,"It never ceases to amaze me how the people here don’t stop while they’re ahead, even when they could never work again and live off the money they earned. But like I said, it amazes me, godspeed. I don’t have the guts or the greed to do something like that."
2021-06-26 17:24:45,wallstreetbets,Dump that garbage and put your capital to work in a real ticker.
2021-06-26 17:25:46,wallstreetbets,Roll over your losing trades simple 😉
2021-06-26 17:30:19,wallstreetbets,Jesse says “never average down” “never chase the tape” “observe the line of least resistance” “get out when you lose 10%”
2021-06-26 17:33:45,wallstreetbets,"Bro did nobody learn from last time? I swear half of us were bagholding BB at the same fucking price as this time and I thought everyone was smart enough to average down over the months and then sell at the next pump, which was this lol wtf"
2021-06-26 17:58:28,wallstreetbets,If I had that kind of money on the market I would have it on helium one. I'm not a pumper it just sounds like a good company with some solid fundamentals http://www.helium-one.com/presentations/
2021-06-26 18:11:38,wallstreetbets,Should’ve threw it into CLOv
2021-06-26 18:20:45,wallstreetbets,Just start selling covered calls. You’ll start feeling better.
2021-06-26 18:41:53,wallstreetbets,One thing for sure is that it won’t become an aurora cannabis or a choom. It’ll eventually recover long. Or just fucking yolo it on amc or clov!
2021-06-26 18:57:59,wallstreetbets,You got balls bro. All eggs in same basket
2021-06-26 19:04:58,wallstreetbets,Time to make it an even 20000 shares and sell 200 CCs at a time. Not financial advice
2021-06-26 19:05:14,wallstreetbets,Loss Porn for the win
2021-06-26 19:22:15,wallstreetbets,Don't tell me about it. My $21 calls in the mud 😭😭😭
2021-06-26 19:36:49,wallstreetbets,BB stands for big balls.
2021-06-26 19:52:42,wallstreetbets,Seen worse.  Much worse.
2021-06-26 19:53:19,wallstreetbets,"Def BB it’s not a stock to invest in, chose wish, chose RBLX roku NIO"

2021-06-26 05:59:17,wallstreetbets,#looks like it is heading back to sub $10.  Glad I got out during the recent spike.  I may jump back in at $8.  This is not investment advice...
2021-06-26 07:37:15,wallstreetbets,The great distraction stock!
2021-06-26 09:56:59,wallstreetbets,"Sell BB and put that money into AMC
YOLO advice"
2021-06-26 05:48:03,wallstreetbets,Ouch
2021-06-26 13:55:10,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry man it’s coming we are all hurting faith is a powerful tool
2021-06-26 10:14:51,wallstreetbets,I’m down 25%.
2021-06-26 15:19:31,wallstreetbets,As I said elsewhere: BB is a long term hold. Hold for 50 years and you'll have enough tendies to buy yourself a nice funeral
2021-06-26 14:47:46,wallstreetbets,Where is the bag holding bot?
2021-06-26 13:45:05,wallstreetbets,But $20 down to $10 hurts a lot less lmao

2021-06-25 23:09:31,wallstreetbets,Either you are very small or your diet needs a serious overhaul. Less P.F. Chang’s.
2021-06-26 13:47:57,wallstreetbets,I felt this.
2021-06-26 08:38:48,wallstreetbets,"Same, averaged down to $15.50 range so far, hoping it goes back to $7-8 range so I can really average down."
2021-06-26 09:31:55,wallstreetbets,"I did similar with $CRSR. I got in at $38+ and have been slowly averaging down. I’m at like $36 now and it’s been on a steady, but well-paced, upward trend the last 3 days.

Im hoping like hell to break even next week, but we’ll see."

Hope Dudley isn't still a jerk."

I had one of those back in the day.  Cool as shit then."
2021-06-26 01:58:11,wallstreetbets,All in on Newton
2021-06-25 23:38:26,wallstreetbets,Same thought.  I bought 0dte ITM calls based on that alone.  I made...  12 bucks.

2021-06-26 00:30:40,wallstreetbets,So messy!
2021-06-26 18:51:00,wallstreetbets,CLOV is kicking my ass
2021-06-26 18:50:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah at this point holding blackberry long term is the wise bet - you’ll get 10-15% a year on it when the markets not insane on it. It’s a good performance company and the current market fluctuations have nothing to do with valuation.
2021-06-25 23:40:43,wallstreetbets,"I remember why this was pushed so hard back in December/January.  ...and I still agree with the thesis.  Nothing has changed.  Granted, it covered a lot of its value since then, but I'd be shocked if it doesn't continue."
2021-06-26 14:26:36,wallstreetbets,AMC going back down to $2
2021-06-26 10:59:43,wallstreetbets,Shit. Thanks guys. I don't feel so bad now. I'm down 19% and was thinking about ending it all. Lol
2021-06-26 15:41:08,wallstreetbets,"How many GMEs, AMC, and CLOVs will you miss in 50 years?  Forget that.  Make sure you have ammo so you can catch other rockets!"
2021-06-26 15:45:26,wallstreetbets,I just needed some time with my stupid Buy to.keep me in check ! Lol
2021-06-25 23:20:15,wallstreetbets,I will .. I was waiting on dip ..cause it ramp.up in June
2021-06-26 00:29:02,wallstreetbets,Sound strategy 🤔
2021-06-26 02:44:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah BB was always a long value play, not a meme stonk. Holding them bags with the rest of you."
2021-06-26 05:27:25,wallstreetbets,Sadly they weren't puts.
2021-06-26 07:38:41,wallstreetbets,If OP doubles down it’s only a 10% loss for now.
2021-06-26 17:10:41,wallstreetbets,At least gut-wrenching inflation won’t be a concern during this period.
2021-06-26 19:12:56,wallstreetbets,Especially after the creditors committee gets their hands on it
2021-06-26 18:23:21,wallstreetbets,That’s fucking hilarious
2021-06-26 08:07:25,wallstreetbets,"No, he's just full of shit."

2021-06-26 03:12:30,wallstreetbets,"Lol, What’s wrong with you? First at all, he put his money in a meme stock, don’t have any rights to complaint, High risk with a possible high reward....we are playing casino here, and you need to take some anger management courses."
2021-06-26 03:11:35,wallstreetbets,well dont invest so much it hurts then?
2021-06-26 13:28:23,wallstreetbets,I did not think of that cause I'm still pretty new but I'mma do that
2021-06-26 18:02:54,wallstreetbets,"This is what I'm doing with BB. I sell weeklys at the next strike price above my average cost. It's helping.

Edit: I'm also buying more shares with the proceeds to average down."
2021-06-26 02:21:32,wallstreetbets,I got the defective one…it’d reset and I’d lose everything I put into it…third time went in drawer for good.
2021-06-25 23:02:49,wallstreetbets,"Your issue was thinking BB is a pump and dump meme stock. It's a future investment in electric vehicles and cyber security, you saying it will never ""moon"" means you don't think EV tech is the future?"
2021-06-26 18:57:00,wallstreetbets,"If you’re risk adverse the keep it in bb but if you don’t want to wait and willing to take the cut, then flip it into something else. I did that a few times. Cut my loss, after waiting for stock to recover which it never did (Gilead) I sold it for a 15% loss, flipped it to to aurora cannabis and some other weed stocks, made 700% returns and sold 70% of the stocks just before it tanked. The 20k I had left dropped down to 9k and never recovered. My initial investment was 6k and I grew it to 70k. Good thing I withdraw 50k before it tanked."
2021-06-26 14:59:22,wallstreetbets,"You've got shares, you haven't lost a dime. BB will go back up, way over $12.04. Just be patient"
2021-06-26 11:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Hey, at one point I was down 40% on Amc when AMC was $8. Wait and eventually we be mooning"
2021-06-26 16:28:44,wallstreetbets,I guess my 12.50 entry point isn’t so bad.
2021-06-26 15:43:31,wallstreetbets,Just sell weekly calls. Makes it much better.
2021-06-26 19:55:01,wallstreetbets,So then how long should i hold bb for?
2021-06-26 18:05:44,wallstreetbets,"The more you keep putting in, the lower the loss. Basic math!"
2021-06-26 17:00:27,wallstreetbets,"This is the way, tbh"
2021-06-26 03:02:49,wallstreetbets,Scbtl sounds like a Dr.!   Whats your hourly rate?!
2021-06-26 11:02:18,wallstreetbets,K
2021-06-26 00:01:26,wallstreetbets,"Yes a future investment true that many are just trying to dump & pump.  
It goes 1 step ahead &  2 steps behind, 1 step ahead & 3 steps behind.  

If I was 20 years old, I would hold.  I bought way too much.  I bought some CLOV and CRSR. No stress, should have done this sooner.  But I do believe BB is a quality future stock to hold. Amen"
2021-06-26 19:59:02,wallstreetbets,Based on how this week ended I'm feeling we won't need to be all that patient.
2021-06-26 13:02:43,wallstreetbets,Yes. Man I remember looking at amc when it was 8$ thinking I had already missed out. Then the same at 20$. Lol
2021-06-26 17:26:07,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino. Adjusted cost basis? We do not do that here.
2021-06-26 17:44:19,wallstreetbets,Y
2021-06-26 16:28:03,wallstreetbets,You made the same mistake twice... you gonna do it again?
2021-06-26 15:50:42,wallstreetbets,Shoot I’m still buying on the dips into the low 50’s.
2021-06-26 17:24:18,wallstreetbets,Nope. I bought in at 58$ lol
2021-06-26 16:32:10,wallstreetbets,Looks that way
2021-06-26 18:08:45,wallstreetbets,"$58? You a retard, I'm so proud of you"
2021-06-26 18:50:27,wallstreetbets,Wait when it hits $200. Then you wish you bought in at $100
2021-06-26 18:56:23,wallstreetbets,"$200? It will hit $1000! I got in at $11, then at $22 then some more at $50"
2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DataRobot + Palantir partnership. But Snowflake is also a partner with DataRobot? 🤔 (Shitpost) This one isn’t for the retards on WSB this post is for the retards on Wall Street. The lack of vision currently on Wall Street has given me hope, it has given me hope that one day I will fuck these guy’s wives in order of how short sighted they are, in descending order (most shortsighted guys wife gets fucked first). 


Palantir has been through the ringer, bashed to shit and compared to this company called Snowflake over and over again. For months, retards like myself have been saying they’re completely different and that Palantir is in a league of its own. What does Palantir do? I have no fucking clue but whatever it is they do they do it better than Snowflake and whoever else does it. You can tell by Karps hair which company is superior. These absolute retards on Wall Street decide to ignore Karps hair in some sort of weird defiance and bets against this mans doo, well guess what? Life doesn’t work like that, imagine betting against Einstein because you didn’t like his hair. Retards, the lot of them. 


If DataRobot is partnered with Snowflake, and for some reason institutions are googly eyed about snowflake and it’s capabilities then why the fuck did DataRobot have to partner with Palantir?

2021-06-25 22:39:31,wallstreetbets,"IMHO you should avoid this like the plague.

The only thing that was remanded to the lower court is whether the structure in place (the director of the agency being insulated from being fired by the president of the USA) is deserving of any compensation by share holders.

My guess is that it does not.

All the other paths to share value are dead. The court affirmed the legislation that bailed out the companies. Meaning that all future profits will accrue to the US Treasury. Also in the event that the US Treasury eventually begins letting profits rest in the companies the treasury holds warrants that would give it ~80% of the common shares (massive dilution). Honestly though why would they let that happen when their senior preferred shares give it 100%. Also, before those common shares would have any value the junior preferred share holders would have to be made whole.

Common shares in these entities are worth zero dollars. The junior preferred shares are worth close to zero. The reason here is that if I I believe the US government likes the situation of money flowing into the treasury without need for taxes. So why not continue with the current arrangement? The reason they reason being that you can’t unscramble the egg. These companies would have been bankrupt at the start of the Great Recession if not for the bailout. So equity holders would have been wiped out then. As it stands equity holders are wiped out in almost every way.

That said you can still purchase shares, just know that like lottery tickets there is little chance of winning and that even if you do win the jackpot gets split among all equity holders with the junior preferreds getting the lion’s share."
2021-06-25 22:09:05,wallstreetbets,"Well. SCOTUS ducked the opinion except for the “fire the director of the FHFA” , which the White House already said will be done. The director position was unconstitutional. That was basically the same as the preceding decision of the CFPB case. And Justice Alito remanded the “remedy” part back to the lower courts. This outcome was disappointing but it was a possibility. On the question of “remedy” the SCOTUS justices splintered into several fractured assessments to unscramble the egg, which made a consensus impossible, except they each offered individual opinions to agree or disagree on various components. So it drops back to the 5th circuit court of appeals. The Dems want the FHFA to be more progressive. Probably one of the rare times these plaintiffs would agree with the government. This suggests bringing FNMA and FMCC out of conservatorship will proceed faster. That is good news. There will be a lot of opinions flying around for awhile. Let the smoke clear. Don’t lock in losses prematurely. This is a long term play. And I did NOT sell my position, if that matters.
Of course, I could be wrong….

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Jar Jar Binks stratagem I would like to draw your attention to a trading strategy that we call the Gungan, also known as ""trading the Jar Jar"". That could be of use here.

This is when the stock chart manifests the outline of Jar Jar Binks, true hero of the Star Wars saga who first appeared in *Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace*, a Gungan who became a Senator, and was instrumental in the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine's rise to power, and the ultimate destruction of the Galactic Republic.

Some recent examples of Gungans include BlackBerry (**BB**), Tesla (**TSLA**), and Twitter (**TWTR**).

When a stock manifests this pattern, it experiences three (3) distinct stages. Each stage corresponds to a quote by Jar Jar Binks in the Star Wars movies:

**Stage 1.** from Jar Jar Binks' right ear to his right eye: 

>""Yousa Follow Me Now, Okeyday?"" 

In other words follow Jar Jar, the stock share price is on an accelerating, upward trend and it is rational to buy.

[Stage 1.](https://preview.redd.it/qfjrx0kbfi771.jpg?width=1601&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fec6ea64ef633e2b83ca41387ac3c316ed2d766)

**Stage 2.** from Jar Jar Binks' left eye to his right eye: 

>""Uh-Oh. Big Boomers. Ohh! Ohh! Huuhh! Uh-Oh! Ahhh! Hey! Hey! Give Me A Lift! Aaah! Oh! Aaah! Ohh!""

In other words, the share price will dip due to Boomer media lies and paper hands, but will lift again. Once it lifts, reaching the second peak (Jar Jar's left eye), consider selling.

[Stage 2.](https://preview.redd.it/058edlucfi771.jpg?width=1682&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c1943c09e892f24e2961e96e1c8aa0ebb94697e)

**Stage 4.** from Jar Jar Binks' left eye to left ear: 

>""Wesa Dyin' Here.""

In other words Jar Jar is informing you that the share price is plunging and if you haven't already, you should sell by now.

[Stage 4.](https://preview.redd.it/8yg39zmdfi771.jpg?width=1683&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5c5843662d91b814283f429f8b225d1a7ecab78)

Trading the Jar Jar is a ***very*** complex financial strategy, however this pattern works because, like Jar Jar Binks, the stock market is retarded. 

*Note: this is not financial advice, this is art.*"

What if the next cycle according to Gungan TA would be the ultimate plot twist, the most unexpected reveal. Jar Jars thought to be on the Republics side, whom wield green lightsabers. Stretching from his left ear, to the tip of his green laser space dildo is the next wave. Not gonna find a quote but he’s probably got a good one for it. 

Next, the plot twist. Jar Jar Binks reveals himself as the Sith Lord in the next cycle of Gungan TA. This is shown by the red candles dropping down quickly, resembling a red lightsaber fucking your shit up. 

Think, What Would Jar Jar Binks Do. AKA WWJJBD as it’s come to be known by those who trade against the Galactic Empire. Some have turned a profit with this investing philosophy. Others have lost so much money, they end up drinking themselves into oblivion, eventually slurring their speech to sound more like Jar Jar Binks after checking their FD’s.

2021-06-26 18:50:42,wallstreetbets,To be fair both seem to be valued very well but for me Corsair is more appealing especially based on It's most recent quarter. So there are questions about how well the companies will do post pandemic. After Q1 we can see Turtle beach's revenue dropped 30%  from previous quarter.  Net revenue dropped 40%. Now with Corsair their revenue dropped only 5% but their net profit actually went up 5% compared to the previous quarter. I know It's only  one quarter but a bit difference nevertheless.
2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TICKER SPCE 🚀🚀 History was made, and we’re all apart of it. Virgin Galactic has just been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) 

Some brief DD to get you started:

-Virgin galactic’s competition; which includes the company “Blue origin”, founded by Jeff bezos(yawn, the billionaire’s success with Amazon and his unlimited supply of funding doesn’t mean he will be the leading company of space flight, as a fan of Jeff, and an admirer of his ambitions, it doesn’t mean he’ll be #1 in commercial space flight, which has already been proven) has yet to meet the standards of the FAA for approval. Although Blue Origin has applied, it was unable to obtain an FAA license,(im not saying that someday Blue origin will not be approved in the future) but presently, as of right now, Blue Origin was unable to meet the extremely high standards and regulatory requirements to safely partake in the transport of actual human life. 


Brief DD about the company Virgin Galactic:

-Virgin Galactic manufactures air and space vehicles and the company’s spaceship operations include commercial human spaceflight, flying commercial research, and development payloads into space.


Onto DD about TICKER SPCE: 

-On today, Friday, June 25th, Virgin was Granted approval by the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) for a full commercial space-launch license, opening the door for outside passengers to join flights, this approval was made following the successful test flight on May 22.

-Last month Virgin Galactic completed its first manned space flight from its new home port in New Mexico in May, as its SpaceShipTwo craft with a capacity of six passengers glided to a landing on a runway safely with its two pilots.

-The company so far has more than 600 reservations for 90-minute flights that include several minutes of weightlessness, priced at $250,000 a ticket.


FUTURE PLANS
-Richard Branson, along with Virgin plans to send passengers to space in a rocket-propelled vessel that is launched from a highflying airplane. After being dropped from about 50,000 feet in the skies over New Mexico, the spacecraft shoots above the Karman Line—the imaginary lower boundary of space—where passengers experience weightlessness for a few minutes before the spacecraft descends and lands on a runway.

The roughly 600 people who have signed up as future passengers with Virgin Galactic would likely pay less than $500,000 for a ride, Virgin executives have said.

Virgin hopes eventually to offer space flights from multiple locations. The company has also cited plans to take tourists to orbiting hotels and to use its vehicles for superfast long-distance travel. The Virgin spacecraft is flown by a pair of pilots. Blue Origin’s capsule is fully automated and is launched vertically from the ground in Texas.



Why did I spend the hours of research it took to provide my community with this information. Well it’s quite simple, as an individual who was born and raised under the poverty line, I was always willing to split a slice of bread with a friend or stranger who was hungry, even if it meant less food for myself. fast forward several decades, I’ve come along way, but I’ve never lost sight in the fact that majority of the people struggle financially, wether you’re below the line or walking it. 
We all know space is the future, and Virgin galactic was able to achieve is just a step forward in that direction, but that step is historic. All i want is the average person, poor or middle class, below the line or walking the line, all across the globe, regardless of ethnicity or background, to partake in this financial opportunity, that is truly the first of its kind. We use the term “to the moon” constantly, but this my friends, is directly related to outer limits of our planet. SPCE to the moon lol. Let us all prosper financially in this historic event. wether you’ve been 💎🙌🏼 SPCE in anticipation for this, or you’re joining the movement now. Welcome, and I wish you all nothing but success! SPCE will 🚀. All aboard! And if you’re wondering my prediction for next week and beyond, you think ticker TSLA had a good week? Just get ready for this baby lol"

2021-06-25 22:23:14,wallstreetbets,I’m with you since 22$!  Next week $90 possible 100 if Branson announces 7/4 flight… easily see us at 75 Monday close

2021-06-25 21:36:29,wallstreetbets,Too bad I sold covered calls at $47 and $50 :( I guess I've got 45% of my cost back selling calls for 18mo and up 70% if I get assigned. Can't bitch about profit.
2021-06-26 15:36:04,wallstreetbets,No way does this end before the flight in July
2021-06-25 21:26:06,wallstreetbets,It’s still early to get in!
2021-06-26 14:20:36,wallstreetbets,I love how the only way people buy in a company on this subreddit is if it does extreme gains then they buy in and if they lose money they get confused. Why didn't you guys buy at 20. I mean like seriously it's a rocket company sending people to space
2021-06-26 03:16:40,wallstreetbets,"I want everyone to have the same opportunities as well…above or below the poverty line.  But listen up! 
The world is not your friend. There are those who are wealthier and those who are poorer. The world is not a fair place. Not everyone can afford to buy a lambo and not everyone can afford to go to space. The motivation and determination to strive to become better and have more is built within. Do not undermine it and do not discount it for the world is not your friend. It’s yours for the taking!"
2021-06-25 21:59:57,wallstreetbets,"This company sells glorified plane rides that barely take you to the edge of the atmosphere. It’s an incredibly uncomfortable plane ride (massive g forces) that takes 3 days of training, all for a few minutes of weightlessness as you’re cramped in with others. Those “reservations” at “250k” take nothing but a $1,000 *refundable* deposit to reserve your spot.

$SPCE is a cute ticker. But the reality is they’re using very old technology and have a product that I really don’t see anyone actually paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for. And if there’s a company that will be providing this service, it’s gonna be SpaceX as they’ll do it magnitudes of order cheaper and better.

If you want to FOMO into a dumbass company with a track record of massive delays and serious setbacks, go ahead. But don’t be mad when you’re bagholding."

Google it ..I’ve repositioned since April, in the 20s..(mad gains from the peak prior like a boss) , and my position now will 🚀 like many others.....but only way that happens is if new investors invest....buying volume is what increases a stock..hope this basic logic helps your flawed perception.

2021-06-25 22:24:30,wallstreetbets,Don’t waste money on puts! Buy stocks and we go higher. On top of it why would the FAA approve if he would jeopardize his life knowing everyone is watching this event

2021-06-26 01:12:34,wallstreetbets,Same here thats why I think I will cash out Tuesday morning and buy in for July 9th lol
2021-06-25 21:16:55,wallstreetbets,"Lol no..just got done with work..rode the wave up once the news came out, made some good profit...got home at 745pm and went straight to making this point..was so into it I forgot to scroll through Reddit beforehand 🤣"

But I just want tendies"

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,To the moon with $SPCE! Virgin galactic just received FAA approval today for the space flights. This same day the stonk jumped 40%. I’ve done some DD looked at the past charts the company has had some dips but has skyrocketed 🚀 this year. Now they plan the first commercial flight with passengers to be by July 20th. Have even seen some comments about the owner Richard Branson speeding up the process and going this next weekend as a 4th of July special! Judging by the rises in the charts lines right up with every flight they have launched and big announcement progress towards the space flight. I’m no expert but I am confident we will see a all time high the day this rocket goes up! We will 🚀 with the 🚀!!! Ape like banana! I am excited to see what happens Monday and this coming week. Not financial advice and is just meant for general discussion.

2021-06-25 23:06:40,wallstreetbets,"I bought at $18 and sold around $29 last week.

I’ll buy back in after I make some extra money somewhere else"

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic $SPCE roars $SPCE charts show a parabolic move. After hours it touched 59. if you look at the chart the buildup is very clear. Virgin Galactic has gotten approval for a full commercial license launch. This is huge and the company will start generating revenue by the end of 2021.

$SPCE stock is already 130% YOD, with the news and the current trend in the overall stock market it will not be surprising to see ATH  and some good momentum to follow up in the next week too.

Will we have another gap up on Monday morning too?

2021-06-25 20:18:50,wallstreetbets,I’ve held 200 shares for the past year or so.  Have bought and sold a few times.  Made money selling options on them as well.  I was SO CLOSE to liquidating when it tanked a couple months ago.  So glad I diamond handed and can ride SPCE to space.
2021-06-25 20:08:19,wallstreetbets,We’ll reach a new ATH on Monday

But Monday after the market opens I’m planning to buy a couple of calls for maybe7/16-7/23? Can anyone say something should I go in or little late now?"
2021-06-26 08:47:29,wallstreetbets,This is one of the worst TA posts I've read ever. It even ends with a question.

2021-06-25 22:55:11,wallstreetbets,"Couldn't have said it better, this stock is half of my portfolio at average cost of 20. Loving the gains and loving the vision of a future in space."
2021-06-26 00:32:35,wallstreetbets,Yes and the financial statements will start reflecting the growth. It is a huge step and the growth potential is mind boggling
2021-06-26 02:08:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I actually almost sold some calls  a few days ago, thank god I didn’t.

2021-06-25 21:37:39,wallstreetbets,Puts!? Time to buy calls!
2021-06-25 21:05:54,wallstreetbets,"Look back on my comments, sold covered call 2 days ago, spikes over 40% in the next day or two, I either had to take an L and buy close or let it ride until July 9th - but who wants to sell 100 shares at 46.50 when the stock is at 58, so I took a 1300 dollar ""loss"" to buy close which really only breaks me even from 46-59 but I also keep my 140 premium so realistically I'm even after dropping 1150 to hold the 100 shares and see if they keep running."
2021-06-26 19:52:08,wallstreetbets,i would hedge if monday is a gap-up
2021-06-25 22:12:28,wallstreetbets,I ALMOST sold $60 covered calls today expiring next week. Luckily they didn’t go through as after hours everything shot up
2021-06-25 21:11:55,wallstreetbets,"I’m in the same boat man, but the premium on the 65$ call is solid right now"
2021-06-25 22:23:37,wallstreetbets,That would've been retarded retarded.
2021-06-25 23:08:29,wallstreetbets,"I was just playing Theta and IV.   
  
I was planning to sell 2 covered calls for $60 strike price at $700 premium (so $1,400 total) but the price maxed out at $600 premium, so the option didn’t go through.   
  
I own shares I bought at $20, so even if they got sold I would have made $8000 profit.  
  
So not as retarded as one might assume. But happy it didn’t go through nonetheless"
2021-06-26 00:00:33,wallstreetbets,I've got 140 shares at 27.31

2021-06-25 22:55:24,wallstreetbets,"Some advice I got on here a while back I wish I had followed — after a big win, take a break from the market. Withdraw some/most of the winnings. Take a small vacation with the gains.

All too often we become desensitized to the gains and they become just numbers on a screen, and we forget the actual real value of that much money.

Edit - And don’t forget to set aside some for taxes!"

2021-06-25 22:29:04,wallstreetbets,"So for your very first trade, you dumped 25k into meme stock calls.

You have balls of fucking steel or are actually retarded.

I hope you're very cognizant to the mechanics of option contracts, and that $25k was money you were willing to take a hit on, as there was only 14 days to expiry on these contracts."
2021-06-26 03:19:10,wallstreetbets,Now quit while you’re ahead 😂

2021-06-25 20:17:43,wallstreetbets,Rock the wheel now. $100k can easily generate $3k per month in premium.

2021-06-26 14:21:23,wallstreetbets,Never bought an option before. Better risk the cost of a new car just to be sure I understand options.

If those shares were then sold at the peak of 55$ that would be 90,200$

There's a giant chunk of money missing from that equation

2021-06-26 12:42:47,wallstreetbets,Let it ride. LET IT RIDE!!!
2021-06-26 19:43:18,wallstreetbets,Contratz! If you're going to trade options going forward head over to TastyWorks. They're the best platform for it. That $100 commission would be capped at $10.00 to open the trade and no commission to close it.
2021-06-26 09:58:54,wallstreetbets,That's pretty cool. Does the bot only keep track of when your first comment is? As a long time lurker I'm interested in how long I been here.

2021-06-26 18:53:25,wallstreetbets,lmfao.. np 👍🦋🦋🦋🍆
2021-06-26 10:18:15,wallstreetbets,Very first option was 25k on a short dated ITM? I knew this was Geneva’s burner before I saw the order #.
2021-06-25 21:28:05,wallstreetbets,Uhh... where do I get my free one?  I was told there would be a free one but I didn't get my free one.
2021-06-25 22:23:23,wallstreetbets,Right? Thought I was a genius at first...
2021-06-26 00:48:23,wallstreetbets,I thought that was a joke. So one day i paper traded options and indeed came out on top. Next day i used my real account and lost
2021-06-25 22:38:31,wallstreetbets,"It really is, and let me warn you fuckers right now: if you waste your first one paper trading, there's no givemebacks.

t. learned the hard way making tons in paper and failed first real money option"
2021-06-25 22:25:25,wallstreetbets,everybody gets one... one
2021-06-26 00:17:49,wallstreetbets,The first options call is free? Where?
2021-06-26 01:39:07,wallstreetbets,"It really is. It's a free lesson on whether you might or might not come out on top. And let me tell you, it sucks learning that right at the start.

I lost money within 5 minutes of depositing cash. I literally clicked something stupid, clicked something stupider than that, and then clicked something to really even out the stupidity. Fucking $200 dollars like a dumbass."
2021-06-26 03:39:24,wallstreetbets,It immensely helps with my jealousy to know that OP won’t keep the money for long.
2021-06-26 00:35:41,wallstreetbets,"Thank you and yes that's correct. Been in SPCE since 2019 and saw 2 catalysts coming up, billionaire ego war, and another space flight. TBH if I had known about the FAA decision I would have taken a 50c instead of 40c"
2021-06-25 22:33:36,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I did something similar with gme back in January.

Still the only time I ever used options."
2021-06-26 11:29:44,wallstreetbets,and he didnt even get a 10bagger out of it

2021-06-26 00:21:41,wallstreetbets,Don't tease me with a good time LT
2021-06-26 06:31:35,wallstreetbets,"Right, makes me feel like a little bitch, dippin my toes in, dangling my legs in the water before deciding to slowly slip into the pool. This motherfucker the type that runs full speed jumps into a belly flop, grabs their heels, arches back, and slams into the water nuts first."
2021-06-26 10:31:34,wallstreetbets,"My first call option was on January 27th for GME $60. I think it was like 1.30 and I sold the next day for 10.50. 

If I held for another week it would of been something like $300.00. 

Anyway, that was basically my investing heroin and I've been chasing that dragon."
2021-06-25 21:44:45,wallstreetbets,Gotta eat the green ones
2021-06-25 22:01:34,wallstreetbets,Have you tried shoving the crayon up your ass?
2021-06-25 23:19:10,wallstreetbets,"You gatta start somewhat my anime friend! You could have bought 1 40c when I bought last week if you had wanted. But hindsight and shit, do your DD and invest in what you know.

2021-06-25 23:06:00,wallstreetbets,I’m in the same boat bro. Just bought my first two option contracts today. PSFE 14 strike price expiring in October. Still can’t figure out what my favorite color crayon is but they all taste the same once I pull them out of my ass.
2021-06-26 06:05:50,wallstreetbets,"prolly didn't eat enough green crayons b4 i went into my first options play, paid $7k for my first lesson.  but no worriES , have put $12k into my 2nd options play - CLOV $15 calls, 21 jan 2022. literally can't go tits up"

2021-06-26 15:54:49,wallstreetbets,You have 200$ and you come to wsb for investment advice. This is why you only have 200$ to invest.
2021-06-25 23:31:32,wallstreetbets,Maybe spend 25% on a boat and 25% on the fuel and upkeep. That's prob what you meant tho

why would anyone want boats? They just depreciate into oblivion, and you can't even have sex with it"
2021-06-26 00:26:51,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! I stopped on the way home to pick up a few bottles of nice gin to enjoy. I put up money I intended to set aside for cap gains on this trade, I think I'll be pulling a bit off the table for uncle Sammy"
2021-06-25 23:42:09,wallstreetbets,This.
2021-06-26 01:06:13,wallstreetbets,I unintentionally did that my first big win this year and honestly such good advice
2021-06-26 09:31:13,wallstreetbets,"I started with 700 and added a little bit (200ish) every month for three months now. strictly stock trading I am up to 6,600 now.  


I can honestly say this,  scared money doesn't make money, Money makes more money, So keep investing what you make, don't cash out your earnings, find another cash cow when the one you have dries up.

I have had a couple moves kick me in the sack and was left with bags that weren't doing anything. don't wait for that shit to come back, go find a winner and stop wasting time waiting for a flat lined stock to come back.

2021-06-25 23:42:08,wallstreetbets,I feel like this was a meme stock but then became real thing after that flight into actual space in May. Now the meme stocks are everything that reeks of desperation on the WSB homepage.

2021-06-25 23:26:57,wallstreetbets,Dude made ~$125k profit and u bitching about $100?
2021-06-25 22:32:57,wallstreetbets,Shut the hell up $100 is nothing if you’re getting great fills and 150k
2021-06-25 20:11:57,wallstreetbets,"It's only $1 per option, $2 per if you count selling the options too. This was 100 $40 calls. Worth it to use a good broker instead of Robbing-hood 🤷"
2021-06-25 21:43:20,wallstreetbets,Lol imagine about complaint about a < 1% commission to execute at best order instead of PFOF bullshit.
2021-06-25 21:04:27,wallstreetbets,“Easily” 42% a year 😂
2021-06-25 20:41:36,wallstreetbets,What is that? You can gain 3k / month with 100k? With apy?
2021-06-25 22:56:22,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Choose TSLA with a shot of QQQ and you’ll pull a few Gs each month in premiums. Idk about 3k, but you can probably pull $1.5k reliably."
2021-06-25 22:50:52,wallstreetbets,Where are you getting consistent 3% a month?
2021-06-25 22:53:44,wallstreetbets,How so?

2021-06-25 23:57:22,wallstreetbets,That is a great idea
2021-06-26 00:04:08,wallstreetbets,Dividends are a waste. Buy Apple and sell covered calls. Make your own “dividends” monthly equal to a dinosaur dividend company.
2021-06-26 17:16:46,wallstreetbets,Why would you go for dividends when instead you can just do risky covered calls and have a high chance of not paying tax on dividends?
2021-06-26 00:42:00,wallstreetbets,I bought the calls on the 17th after hearing of Bezos' flight and knowing it would spark the billionaire space race. But been buying shares of SPCE since 2019.
2021-06-26 00:59:16,wallstreetbets,Idk if the actual order number is PII but I see people blocking out all sorts of random shit so why not block it out with an Easter egg than only 4 people have commented on?
2021-06-26 08:33:08,wallstreetbets,And that's what makes an epic true WSB degenerate retard purist like all the legends of the past here.

2021-06-25 23:36:31,wallstreetbets,Maniac laughing ensues
2021-06-26 00:44:56,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! I bought my calls at 2.45 I hope this was you too. I need to learn about selling covered calls. Could I have gotten your calls if you sold for above or below what I bought at? Vanguard doesn't let me do market orders only limit orders, so that's what I set my limit at."
2021-06-26 00:17:12,wallstreetbets,"Bought the contracts last week after the billionaires started their space measuring contests, always been up since I bought. I've been in SPCE since the SPAC days and holding a bit more than 2k shares at a $13ish average."

2021-06-26 01:07:46,wallstreetbets,Part of this came from clov earnings 😅

2021-06-26 09:47:31,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like they had a lot more to play with to begin though.

Don't feel bad, I only made 9 dollars on my first call option - but that was like a 30 percent return."

2021-06-25 22:54:18,wallstreetbets,probably color blind and ate the red instead

2021-06-26 08:50:27,wallstreetbets,Leaps are great on low IV blue chip stocks if they have been depressed in price. Super cheap and you can effectively guarantee its going back up.. Presuming it's stock market conditions and not company performance.

2021-06-26 08:41:01,wallstreetbets,probably because it doesn't generate any income

Your strike was 40$? You bought 66 contacts aka 6600 shares? And later just sold the contract? Who .. would buy it? And do you have a guarantee that the selling of the contract goes through? 

I have so many questions.. I'm kind of postponing buying my first contract because I don't get these things, yet."

Maybe not a meme stock, but a risky motherfucker for a long-term hold. A month ago your stock was on track to wipe out all gains from the entire time you've held it the last two years."
2021-06-26 06:26:47,wallstreetbets,"I bought in 2019 too and still holding. My avg price is $18.76, 200 shares."
2021-06-26 01:12:44,wallstreetbets,It’s always been a meme stock.
2021-06-26 00:01:51,wallstreetbets,"True, not full meme anymore, but I’d still like to see them make a single dollar of revenue before I value the company at 11B.

I love what they are doing, space flight is amazing. But it’s not gonna be easy to monetize at all. And as of right now they have less lifetime revenue than NKLA.(lol)"

2021-06-25 20:15:19,wallstreetbets,"You'll find out how good your broker is with options when shit hits the fan. I use Interactive Brokers, and when Biden announced his tax plan, I learnt that Interactive Brokers do a poor job of getting contracts out of your hands if you try sell them at market. That being said, my contract closed about $30 below my stop price so I definitely didn't get fucked as hard as some others on that day."
2021-06-25 21:59:05,wallstreetbets,"yeah you pay more on RH despite it being ""free"", slippage is terrible

I've had to sell calls at the bid on spreads literally two cents wide on RH"
2021-06-25 21:49:01,wallstreetbets,"I started investing with Vanguard funds when I first started, then moved to stocks and now a margin account. Just been sticking with Vanguard since all my stocks are there giving me more leverage. Been thinking of moving eveything into a broker that has a better UI and eveything, but just starting to dip my toes into options so haven't looked for other brokers yet."
2021-06-25 21:41:05,wallstreetbets,"I have a Fidelity, TDA and Robinhood account and in terms of user interface Robinhood is the clear winner. I mean, I like that I don't have to worry too much about Fidelity not letting me buy/sell GME, but the amount of clicks and loading time just to get to the place where I can buy an option is absolutely ridiculous everywhere except Robinhood.

Some examples of where other brokers fail in terms of API:

* Drop downs to select which options we want to view instead of just showing us everything with a scrollbar for a given date. Why is the default showing us like 5 ITM options? 

* More drop downs once we click an option to tell us what we want to do, be it buy/sell/close etc. 

* Making us enter limit prices instead of just giving us a default (Fidelity isn't too bad, you still have to click the bid/ask price. TDA is awful)

* Making us hit a refresh button to see the actual price NOW after we've done all this since its definitely changed since then, instead of just updating automatically and showing the correct price

* Not showing the underlying's value in real time (I mean, this is pretty important if you're trying to buy an option, right?)

All in all, while I do like that they'll fill faster, it still takes me like 5 minutes of sifting through tiny text and awful interfaces to actually purchase the damn thing and often the trade is gone by that point. For long term options that you're planning to hold for 6 months it's not all that bad but for anything that matters short term I'd rather just use Robinhood's interface and not worry about the execution."
2021-06-25 23:28:34,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity charges $.01 commission on options so it is really reasonable given the risk/reward options players take.

Edit: $.01 to the cost basis, not total sum."
2021-06-25 20:53:13,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately for us poor apes, robinhood is the only brokerage that doesn’t require 25k in the account to be able to trade options. I wanna get my money out of there. Where can I go that will allow me to continue to trade options?"
2021-06-25 23:00:39,wallstreetbets,"seriously! 125k+ in profit with 100 bucks in commission. i mean, i hate paying unnecessary fees as much as the next guy, but that's a pretty small percentage and totally worth it to ensure best execution"
2021-06-25 21:02:44,wallstreetbets,Amen
2021-06-26 03:36:39,wallstreetbets,At my brokerage in Canada I would have been charged a total of $260 USD in buy/sell commissions to make that trade. Wild. $9.99 + 1.25/contract on the buy and sells side.

2021-06-25 22:58:36,wallstreetbets,"Lol i had similar run with GME, but luckily mine was with shares.

Bought 1k shares late Jan at $97.56, paper handed at $130 netting a gain of 32k.
Saw it continue running up, FOMO 200 shares at $230 to get back in on the dip, picked up another 500 on the dip again to $100 beginning of Feb. Doubled down with 1k shares at $41 mid Feb. Sold a few shares in June to finally cover how much I took out in margin in Feb, had 3 margin calls during this time. Holding over 100k in shares (give or take the day lol) waiting for 🚀🌕."

2021-06-26 16:20:59,wallstreetbets,Or I'm still really high on all the endorphins I got when spce went brrr yesterday.
2021-06-26 11:14:30,wallstreetbets,"I'm not super knowledgeable about options, just starting out trading options myself. I'll try and answer what I can, and hopefully some more knowledgeable apes here can help us/correct me if I say anything wrong. Figure the best way to learn is to post and see if I'm right or wrong lol.

You are correct 1 contract is equal to controlling 100 shares. I actually bought 100 calls at a 40$ strike price. I just edited out PII from the Screenshot, and instead of leaving the order number blank I figured I'd throw in a little starwars Easter egg for the fellow nerd apes.
I bought the calls last Thursday (6/17 the share price was around 35$ IIRC) paying a premium of $2.45 per share so each contract I bought was $245. To control 100 shares I paid 245$ instead of 3,500. Now multiply this buy 100 because I bought 100 contracts so (10,000 shares) with the strike price (right to buy the shares) at 40$ (and add 1$ per contract for Vanguard's commission. I needed the share price to go above 42.46$ to break even (strike price + premium paid).

Yea i just sold all the contracts Friday morning on the news of FAA approval. I could have been greedy and held them longer, but it was at the upper end of my exit price pre market already. I told myself I'd get out if the shares were around 45-50$ on Friday giving me an estimated sell price of 100k. I figured it had room to grow a bit more, and if it doesn't sell today I can aways wait for the flight planed for July 4th MERIKA FUCK YA! I set a limit order before going to work to sell all 100 contracts for 15$ (1,500$ per contract remember we are talking in terms of 100 shares per contract), and it printed right as I was getting on the highway to work, near the high of the day. I was happy netting 130k in gains, yes I could have waited for the flight, but what if it got postponed. Since my expiration date was so close to the flight I didn't want to risk it. I still have shares in the company for the long haul, I'm just exploring options for short term trades.

As for who bought the calls, hopefully another space ape with $550,000 to pay me and buy those shares at 40$ instead of 80$ or higher on a successful flight. And for why, wouldn't you rather buy shares at 40$ instead of 80$ you can turn around and sell for a profit right away or hold to purchase your space ticket. Selling/buying the contracts I'd say is similar to selling /buying stocks. With Vanguard I can't do market orders for options, only limit orders, set the price you want, when someone wants to buy at that price they meet you behind a Wendy's to trade Pokémon cards and blowies. 

Hopefully that answers some of your questions, if you got more let's try and work through them together."
2021-06-26 08:38:12,wallstreetbets,Keep learning and I would not buy options if I were you.

On TDA, you can cancel/replace your orders with 1 button press, so there is no down time where you don't have an order placed.  With robinhood, you have to cancel the first order and then do a new order.

TDA also has better fills. Enjoy getting a shitty option fill on RH for $5 worse instead of just paying the $0.65 commission on TDA.

You can also view the bid/ask much easier and set up spreads quicker"

Basically wishing for a completely unwarranted jump in price that would give me double/triple digit returns.

That did not happen. Options expired worthless (i.e. auto-sold for less than I bought at the end of the trading day)

So.... Now if I'm gonna buy options, I'll go long as I can. There's plenty of stocks that will show 15-30% gains in the course of a month or so, and since I'm a small fry, that seems like safe and reasonable returns.

I don't think I'll be playing with short expiring options, this one just happened to be two weeks since that was when I learned about the flight getting moved up to beat Bezos.

I think next time I'll try buying a bit more calls and spreading out the expiration dates. If I had gotten some 7/16 calls too those would have printed even more. I was going back and forth on 7/9 and 7/16 calls and ultimately went with the 7/9 cuz they were slightly cheaper."

2021-06-26 04:31:52,wallstreetbets,"Personally I think all the ape and banana shit is cringey as fuck, but you at least have a point. I guess my real point is people shouldn't pretend like buying and holding shares is some sort of righteous crusade. We're here to make money, and there are a lot of ways to do it. Best of luck to you both 🍻"
2021-06-26 15:15:53,wallstreetbets,"Anyone can use it, don't get me wrong, it's just that they charge a $10 monthly fee if you hold less than $100k. I think they have a Lite platform which is free, but I'm not sure how good it is (I'm European)"

2021-06-26 10:04:12,wallstreetbets,this. remember if someone is YOLOing 25k into a gamble they probably have at least a 500k sitting around.

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Investing in pharmaceutical stocks prior to PDUFA. It seems like one could look at the upcoming approval of pharmaceuticals and invest. Even if you sell prior to approval just in case it fails you could make a killing. Just the anticipation of approval seems to make the price go up. Obviously you should also do DD, but if you sell prior it's still a win. If you really think it will get approval then you would make even more if you wait until the PDUFA date. Am I completely missing something here or is this already a common strategy? I just recently discovered the magical world of pharmaceutical stocks and even without doing serious DD I've been consistently seeing gains. This is definitely not financial advice and my experience may be an anomaly, but I'm curious if anyone else has had luck with this particular strategy. I'm also interested in anyone's ideas for upcoming pharmaceutical companies. One stock I've been researching and am heavily invested in is AXSM, which I believe is an interesting new company with alot of potential."
2021-06-25 21:03:34,wallstreetbets,"I've tried this and it's not as easy as it sounds. The biggest issue is most small biotechs constantly dilute shares. So if the stock starts to run up in anticipation, they'll do an offering the next day. And if it does get approval, the stock will drop (oh it was already priced in, whomp whomp) and guess what? They'll also do another stock offering. 

Another problem is, sometimes the approvals are delayed for an unknown amount of time. So you're wasting capital in a stock with no real catalyst date. And while you're waiting, they'll do another dilution..."
2021-06-25 21:50:51,wallstreetbets,"1. If they reject, it tanks

2. If they delay, it tanks

3. If they approve, IT TANKS YOU MOTHERFUCKER!"
2021-06-25 20:56:44,wallstreetbets,"Not sure about the effectiveness of this long term.  I know I've been in some stocks where the PDUFA got delayed, and it definitely wouldn't have worked for those.

I think there are probably more failed drugs than successes, so without deep DD, selling before the PDUFA might be the play, if there is one."
2021-06-25 22:27:04,wallstreetbets,Its viable. I love biotech. I love the fact that some consistently swing +\- 20% monthly with zero news.
2021-06-26 03:51:22,wallstreetbets,"I too have recently got into pharmaceuticals etc.  I see the other DD you linked said AXSM had 5 products in play.  The reason for this post is I think there is a lower risk option which also has potential for upside.

There is another company that provides the anti-body mediums to pharmaceutical companies and clips fees/royalties on a) various clinical approval stages and b) commercialisation of approved drugs.  They currently have over 220 ""shots on goal"" (aka drugs in the pipeline) using various partners and anti-body platforms for lots of different medical conditions.

In other news they have a product they sell at great margins (Captisol which is used by Gilead to fight COVID-19), they are profitable, cash rich and have recently had an earnings upgrade for this year.  The ticker?  LGND on NASDAQ.  More info here : [https://investor.ligand.com/press-releases](https://investor.ligand.com/press-releases)

Their ""tear sheet"" under ""invertor centre"" explains it better than I can.  Also check out the investor presentations.  It's a complicated business and not for the faint hearted or impatient.

2021-06-25 22:40:28,wallstreetbets,You can see the date for them on the FDA website [here](https://www.fdatracker.com/fda-calendar/)
2021-06-26 01:24:57,wallstreetbets,I've noticed alot of them dip at pretty regular intervals... like right after they get to a previous high. Alot of people are saying the companies do a dilution when the price gets real high. Especially the newer ones without any products on the market. I figure they are probably raising funds for future research.
2021-06-25 20:06:07,wallstreetbets,[fda calendar link](https://www.fdatracker.com/fda-calendar/)
2021-06-25 20:05:20,wallstreetbets,"Seems like a month or two is adequate, but the great thing is it's an easy thing to compare."
2021-06-26 12:41:57,wallstreetbets,"I actually looked at LGND yesterday and it was one of the promising companies I found. I noticed alot of the PDUFAs on schedule are for pretty uncommon conditions. I can definitely see where the component product line of LGND makes it a good investment. Kind of like I had investments in UCTT which manufacturers products for the microchip industry instead of investing in INTC or NVDA, but after the whole chip shortage thing doesn't seem to be getting better for awhile. I decided that shifting my money into other sectors might be a good play. I had actually thought investing in UCTT would be a good idea since they would benefit from manufacturers needing to expand, but that didn't seem to be working out."
2021-06-25 22:41:43,wallstreetbets,I meant if there is a play to be had
2021-06-26 01:57:35,wallstreetbets,"Some dilute, some dont. Gotta wade through their financials…"
2021-06-25 23:34:50,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I see what your saying now. I guess I got lucky with AXSM, and it's been doing uncharacteristically well compared to alot of the other PDUFAs coming up. VCEL is also another good looking close one, but it may be a bit too close with a date of the 29th. I also noticed alot of the others are for pretty uncommon conditions. Whereas AXSM is potentially for 3 completely different conditions. All of which are either common (depression) which is it's current close PDUFA(8/22). Or semi common (alzheimer's agitation) which has few treatment options, and another very common (nicotine addiction). I guess once it gets a green light for the first one it will probably be very likely and quickly approved for the other 2. It will also be it's first drug to go to market. I will probably hold onto it because it's a proprietary formulation of two drugs already widely used and safe(wellbutrin and the stuff in cough medicine). So it would seem pretty likely to be approved."
2021-06-26 00:13:49,wallstreetbets,"If it's likely to be approved, could be a sell the news event... Gotta watch out for those, too."
2021-06-26 01:11:12,wallstreetbets,Strangely enough they haven't really been talked about. I've seen some PTs and an announcement about a completely different drug that isn't even going to be submitted for an NDA until next year. I just stumbled across it and did alot of independent DD. I actually just found a reddit post today that explains the ins and outs of whats going on from 2 months ago. It's probably the most thorough and well explained DD I've come across here or anywhere else on any stock.

2021-06-25 21:51:12,wallstreetbets,"I love BNGO, been in since January. It's done more for my account than GME ever did. Easily a $100 stock when it finally takes off.

For those who don't know, BNGO develops and manufactures the Saphyr system. It's purpose is to detect structural variants more quickly and efficiently than anything else on the market. Not only is it a new generation of tech in genomics, it's also supplemental to current technologies. How much are ILMN and PACB worth? 🤔"

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$MCW Mister Car Wash, the Chick-fil-A of car washes Mister Car Wash, previously known as Mister Hot Shine, has fortunately gone public. For those who don’t know, Mister Car Wash is where you go to get a good, quality car wash. This isn’t some spray down bullshit. This isn’t some get out of your car and do it yourself bullshit. This is a high tech, assembly line style operation complete with top notch customer service and free fucking popcorn. It is a well oiled machine cranking out car after car with interior and exterior options, not to mention, an Unlimited Wash Club membership so you can wash your car every time it drizzles or you drive through some Amish horse shit.

This place is a money printerrrrr. I don’t have specific numbers for you because that would take too much work, but having witnessed this operation numerous times, I can safely say they do quite well. The membership fees offer a steady stream of income and you’d be surprised how many people jack themselves off in those express lanes.

Mister is currently expanding at a healthy rate, operating in 21 states and opening a second location 7 miles apart in my area. $MCW? More like $MCD. But one of the most promising aspects of their expansion is the CEO trying to stay level and avoid watering down his product. He’s quoted as saying “What keeps me up at night is that trying to double or triple our footprint over time, we make sure we continue to raise our standards and not grow too quickly. When things start to wobble, the quality and the customer experience start to diminish. Many companies have grown faster than they can support.” Smart man.

Counter Arguments:

Why can’t I wash my own car? 
- Mister offers a premium product and service, therefor it operates in middle to high income areas. That translates to “people willing to pay”. It also means stability and big dollar signs.

I wash my car once every 3 months. How many cars could they really see in a day?
- A lot. You’d be surprised how often people wash their $40k+ cars and throw in a membership, they’re lining up. People like to keep nice things nice.

Why this car wash over other car washes?
- Because it’s the Cadillac of car washes and the only pure play, publicly traded chain. You wouldn’t invest in your favorite local restaurant because you can’t. You’d invest in McDonald’s and like or not, that’d be a pretty good fucking investment before they were in all 50 states and all around the world.

What are the fundamentals?
- I don’t fucking know.


Position: I’m not mister money bags by any means so take this how you will. Bought 20 shares today and looking to invest $1k total. That’s a normal investment amount for me relative to my income. I feel good about their growth potential and will look to reload on any dips to reach that $1k mark.

TLDR: Mister looking to give us all hot shines

Edit: Since I can’t comment on my own post due to low Karma, this is not a seasonal business for a reason someone had mentioned - street salt in the winter. Also, my position is listed at the bottom of the post where it says “Position:”. I even explained what the amount means relative to my income and other investments."
2021-06-25 20:06:43,wallstreetbets,"$135m cash flow but $5b market cap is really sus. Seems overvalued. They also have a 63 P/E.

Not to mention their debt situation. How do they have 1.8b in debt but only operate in 21 states? Surely it can't be that expensive to open a car wash.

Unless they open in the cont48 or all 50 states or worldwide, they're really overvalued. I'll buy at $8/share, not $20."
2021-06-25 20:22:03,wallstreetbets,"Car washes wash more money than anything. Thats like investing in a pawn shop.

They'll NEVER report there actual earnings, thus the CEO's will never sell, because you'll have much more money in the business then you could ever put on paper..... atleast thats how it was explained to me"
2021-06-25 22:47:28,wallstreetbets,"Ive never heard of this company. Why are they worth so much? Do they wash your balls too?

I’m thinking this will get halved pretty soon. I might look at this when it’s far lower. This seems like an OTLY to me - hyped up and over-speculated."
2021-06-26 00:42:00,wallstreetbets,Mister Hot Shine sounds like a blow job place.
2021-06-25 22:43:08,wallstreetbets,"I managed and worked maintenance at a similar carwash and saw financials. And holy shit they fucking bank money. On a busy day we could run 200 cars an hour, doing like 2500 in a day on the nice days between winter and summer at all average of $10-11 a car with no more 120 labor hours on the day."
2021-06-25 20:30:09,wallstreetbets,Positions or Ban.
2021-06-26 00:59:30,wallstreetbets,Didn’t read but my car smells like ass - in for calls at open 🚀🚀
2021-06-26 08:57:01,wallstreetbets,I love this company
2021-06-25 22:14:38,wallstreetbets,Let's all yolo on a car wash company that managed to go public right before the next recession!
2021-06-26 11:46:28,wallstreetbets,"They don't have any financial info available. Untill available, I am gonna wait."
2021-06-25 20:16:52,wallstreetbets,"Not a fan. Had a bad experience there once that's beside the point.

It's a car wash. Just like any other car wash. At least with Chick-fil-A you get good service, one of the best chicken sandwiches in fast food, and a clean well-run fast food restaurant. 

I never got my car washed and was like damn what great service and they clean my car better than another car wash. It's also a seasonal business for anywhere other than the Southwest."
2021-06-25 20:17:57,wallstreetbets,I believe it's because they were rapidly expanding. But it's also a seasonal business unless you're in the Southwest.
2021-06-25 20:18:49,wallstreetbets,Get off reddit. Don't you have some meth to make?
2021-06-26 09:03:17,wallstreetbets,If only so. Hopefully there will be a Misses and I'll go all-in on that birch.
2021-06-25 23:02:53,wallstreetbets,Only a few of us left I guess.
2021-06-25 22:37:00,wallstreetbets,Seasonal business?   Car washes here in NY have lines out to the road from sun up to sun down during the winter because of the road salt.  These things literally print 365 days a year.  I know because I worked at one when I was 16
2021-06-25 20:23:34,wallstreetbets,"Have you considered the impact of covid from last year? I think volume will increase y/y, and the recovery period could be distorting some of those ratios"
2021-06-25 22:07:22,wallstreetbets,Yes I do. I'll go now
2021-06-25 23:40:26,wallstreetbets,Seriously. I'm not even an old timer L. I just feel DD SHOULD HAVE POSITIONS.
2021-06-25 22:43:28,wallstreetbets,"If you are arguing sales in the winter are equal to or better than summer that's a losing argument. You literally can't wash your car if it's freezing out. 

There is a substantial drop in sales in the winter in cold areas.

But hey I'm not arguing what to do with your money. If you like it invest in it."
2021-06-25 20:48:36,wallstreetbets,I'm aware. Their headquarters is about 5 minutes from my house in Tucson. I already think they have the best locations mostly in the Sunbelt. Notice how they're not in the Northeast Mid-Atlantic and Midwest for the most part. They spend more money to expand in those areas it's going to be diminishing returns in my opinion.
2021-06-25 22:44:27,wallstreetbets,Nope you’re 100% wrong.   Sales go up substantially in the winter
2021-06-25 23:42:25,wallstreetbets,"i have no dog in this fight but I can say for certain. i can agree with what sham-wow is saying, I work for a ltl company and we actually ship more soap in the winter than summer... simoniz, kleen rite, and amor all.. by the 55 gallon drum, 30 gallon drums and tote tanks....but I won't be buying this stock i live in the north east and for sure auto-valet is massive in my area"
2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Been holding one of these calls since April. Not a lot but great for one day!

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Massive DD Thread on $BODY. Deep Value for Investors. Hello fellow Redditors! Here i will present you Due Diligence on a company i searched a lot and believe in it short and long term. Not only me but millions of people and huge names like **Shaquille o'Neal, Lebron James, and Arnold Schwarzenegger** since they are all shareholders in the company. The triple threat!!!

I will try in this DD to mention with few words the most important things you need to know and ill try to do it in a way that wont get you tired to read all the post till the end! Clean and simple for you. I share this DD only to show new investors the Deep Value and potential this play brings to the market and nothing else... *After all everyone should search and add his own DD on top*. Who wouldnt like to find $NFLIX early as an investor? Life changing stocks should be found early. Have fun and invest with your own risk to lose or earn! Also **important, not bagholding!**

Lets start the story with an

**Amazing All Star Management Team**:

The BeachBody team includes three former Disney senior executives — **Staggs, Mayer, and Salil Mehta**, its chief financial officer. Other directors, officers, and strategic advisors include Shaquille O’Neal, Peter Schlessel, Keith Horn, Sheila Stamps, Teresa Miles Walsh, and Martin Luther King III.Dont forget also Sue Collyns. No need to just mention that Staggs ([former Disney COO](https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/tom-staggs-disney-out-steps-down-bob-iger-1201745196/)) and Mayer (previously chairman of Disney’s Direct-to-Consumer and International and [briefly CEO of TikTok](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/tiktok-kevin-mayer-resigns-1234750556/)) who both serve as co-CEOs and co-chairs of the board are higly valued and insightfull people along with all the others. Also worth mentioning that in the board also joined a member of **GME** board. Lastly CEO of the company is **Carl Daikeler** who managed to raise a company from VHS tapes to a behemoth that has 22 years of presence without debt and clears above 1+ billion in revenues. All star team with all star celebrities along their side each one valuable for their guidance. I will put some links from Shaqs and Arnold twitter along with Ross Gerber twitter who is bullish from Day 1 like he was in Tesla with their support in the company and the well respected Meet Kevin who is well known in Investing community.

**Lets continue with what exactly $BODY brings to the market**:

Well $BODY was a 3 way merger means you have BeachBody, Openfit and Myx Fitness all together.

**BeachBody on Demand Interactive (BODi)**

BeachBody, historically known for their workout DVD’s and many famous programs (P90x, Insanity, 21 Day Fix, etc), successfully made the transition to streaming On Demand. They are taking it a step further with the addition of BODi, live virtual classes. This additional feature is priced at $20/month on top of BOD which is currently $99/year. (Remember 89% margins on digital subscription revenue). Link to that article [here.](https://tbc-cms-prod-assets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tbc-cms/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/19060123/BODi-Press-Release.pdf)

**OpenFit PartnerShips**

OpenFit (backed by Lebron & Arnold) recently announced a partnership with Concierge Health, a technology platform that provides health engagement solutions to reduce healthcare costs. Concierge Health has a user base of 150M People, which will now have access to OpenFit and receive credit for completing workouts through the app. (Again, 89% margins) Link to that article [here.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005208/en/Openfit-and-Concierge-Health-Announce-At-Home-Exercise-Incentives)

OpenFit also has a partnership with LA Fitness over 700 physical locations , giving all of their gym members access to the app for $5/month. Link [here.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fitness-international-to-provide-its-members-with-openfit-the-all-in-one-digital-fitness-nutrition-and-wellness-platform-301277399.html)

**Myx Fitness**

A simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors. Cheaper is obviously not always better, as a lot of times quality will suffer.But in our situation it seems that it is cheaper and better in quality than most of the competition. I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes. The most negativity I've seen were complaints about shipping times, but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue. A simple search will show you many people that dumped their old bike even it was more expensive for the Myx one. Interestingly, Myx has sold over 27,000 bikes in their first year of sales with the average user completing 15 workouts a month. The attractive pricepoint of their bikes at $1,299 is $600 cheaper than peloton’s basic bike.

**Nutrition (thats a big one) Shakeology**

Shakeology is a superfood nutrition shake that can be a spark that prompts positive change in your life. They’ve also recently acquired Ladder in 2020, “the sports nutrition company founded by LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ladder product is NSF Certified for Sport®, a third-party certification trusted by all major sports governing bodies and verifies that products do not contain any of approximately 270+ substances banned by major athletic organizations and that the contents of the product match what is printed on the label”

You can do a research on all of these on the official websites for more info.

Lets continue with

**Quick Financial Overview:** 1.1B (est) revenue for 2021, 68% gross margins on that rev (which is better than NFLX, DIS, PTON, etc). Digital subscriptions have 89% margins. 43% YoY revenue increase for Q1. Added literally a million subscribers YoY. 400M free cash on the books upon merger w/ no debt. Also expanding to 10+ countries globally in the future starting with Spanish and French from now. Growth company and also tech company as you will see below in the post. Beach body already has more than 2.6 + **MILLION** paid digital subscribers. We will talk about subscribers, coaches and followers below. All in all, this is a financially solid company with plans for growth and expansion (in an industry that is expected to have a CAGR of 33% by 2027, $59B) which happens to have a few meme-like qualities and dont forget **NO DEBT.**

**2021 Q1 Financials**

Total Revenue: $243M - 43% increase YoY

Total Subscriptions: 3.2M - 39% increase (record high)

(Not an actual earnings report, assumed to be released after merger)

**Q2** mentioned on interview will be even better.

**Future Plans & News**

Here’s where they’re really making moves. Carl Daikeler (CEO of BB) and BeachBody has been operating on free cash flow and has been profitable for 20 years. Upon this deal closing, they’ll have what they referred to as a “war chest” of $400M free cash (with no debt) on the books for M&A, marketing, and expansion.

**International Expansion**

The team has recently stated plans of expanding worldwide to 10+ countries in the near future.

**THATS IMPORTANT**. Lets make a break from facts and discuss numbers of followers and subscribers.

If you check company's website and social media and put all the followers together you will see that they have millions of followers, almost 3 million paid subs, thousands of coaches that each one have thousands of followers so again millions of people. Celebrities backing this one Lebron, Shaq, and Arnold together have 70 !!!! million followers only on Twitter, on Instagram they have over 100 million!!!!. Insiders have also thousands of followers, so here its good to say we speak about literally an army of people. **A cult that loves Beachbody.**

Important also is that Carl is a so well organized CEO that knows that BB has thousands of followers so as he mentioned lots of times he has well organized groups and teams in order to connect with each other, in order not to exist many groups on FB or any other social scattered all these people are well organized and managing thousands and millions of people, subs and coaches to connect each other.

Lets talk about

**Tech in Fitness**

Anytime you throw tech into an industry or sector, it instantly becomes more attractive. This is exactly what BB, MYX, and OpenFit are doing. 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded. OpenFit has good ratings on the app store, 4.9 stars from 15k reviews. (App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron) People like the idea of being connected in their workouts, giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike. There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews, this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym. He recently reviewed Tonal, and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward. Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym, or $3k Tonal, or an expensive exercise bike. This is where a $99/year BB subscription could come in.

What about???

**Future of At-Home Connected Fitness**

Why would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over? This is a valid question, but I fully believe people will continue to do so. A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87% (of 1000 participants) who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time. Links to those are [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200817005351/en/The-Future-of-Fitness-Americans-Embrace-a-Hybrid-of-Home-Exercise-and-Gym-Workouts) and [here](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/home-workouts-future-of-fitness). A survey of 3500 American by *The New Consumer* and Coefficient Capital found that 76% of people have tried working out at home during the pandemic—and crucially, 66% prefer it. Among millennials, the number is even higher: 82% made the switch and 81% like it more. Link to article [here](https://www.fastcompany.com/90587575/gyms-arent-coming-back-heres-how-youll-work-out-in-the-future).

Say the truth who prefers working at his own pace with his own music and great programmes instead of being next to people especially after pandemic waiting for his turn on the bikes.

Lets see if there is any

**Bear Case**

None. Only thing bears came in mind was something about MLM scheme but i wont discuss it since Kevin and Carl answered already on all their interviews plus i wont mention MLM companies that their stocks are 50-100 pps because bears are getting nervous.

Finally most important

**PAY ATTENTION TO THE Short Squeeze (summer lemonade) POTENTIAL**

**Check this image**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[8.8&#37; only public shares!](https://preview.redd.it/unkrgq17gh771.png?width=362&format=png&auto=webp&s=6849de07ad327d6a808d1f44d4fc55147312d165)

&#x200B;

Monday $BODY will have less than 30 milly shares available for shareholders that makes it a low float stock. Already buying pressure from retail is obvious. Already many tutes have positions with big names among them **74 total tutes, 65 long only**, 1 short only, 8 long/short with a total of 9 million shares already. As of 15/6 Short float was **20% !!!! in an already low floater**. Check this tweet for proof

[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404894383728730112](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404894383728730112)

Stock already hit 18+ back in February and since then shorts attacked it for several months creating 20% short float on a proven highly profitable growth company and dropping over 50% of its value. Now shares remaining are very low because **most float is locked**. Shorts need aprox. 8 days to cover and they getting trapped more and more every day and while trying to bash the stock everywhere in order to drop the price and get out since the dont have the shares to fight back the pressure. If everyone wants a little piece of this pie as it seems public float will be all locked fast and then ...

Dont forget Monday $BODY rings the bell and will attract more investors and retail plus all the cult behind this company as we mentioned above. This can creat a massive squeeze with shorts covering.

**IMPORTANT-->** Retail shareholders have high conviction and not selling shares, Carl already told that he wont sell even 1 share of his 41%, same applies for the insiders lots of them forgot to mention are unknown **Silicon Valley** investors.

**More MEMEish features**

&#x200B;

* $BODY ticker (hard to ignore) [This](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/stock-picking-buying-a-winner-is-easy-just-find-a-cool-ticker-symbol.html) article details a study that concluded that companies with cool tickers tend to outperform the market better than companies without. Its summer anyways right?
* Comparison to PTON
* Arnold, Lebron, and Shaq are all confirmed shareholders. Collectively, they have 128.7M followers on IG alone. You can imagine what will happen if they start being vocal about their involvement in the company. Dont forget anything big Diesel touch along with the others turns to **gold**, no need to mention other tickers we all know. Who goes against these guys? Everyone loves them.
* Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, both former Disney execs, will be staying on the BeachBody team to help with future growth, post-merge. Kevin Mayer played a large role in the success of Disney+, also former TikTok CEO
* 1+ billion revenue that Carl on interview said that we should add one or two zeros in the future on that **without DEBT** at all and with 400m on chest for marketing and promotion.

I dont want to post links to interviews and websites since we all know to google and search. All are available in youtube and www and i dont want to make this thread longer. **The only thing i will say is this DD thread was to put your attention on this company that as CEO mentions along with all shareholders, insiders and celebrities is the Biggest leading subscription Health and Wellness company offering Tech and Nutrition for the masses in the market. Its the PTON for 99% and the Netflix of digital fitness , all words from the all star team proven to turn into gold everything the worked with.**

Some people say $BODY to 0, 5, 20, 30, 50, 100 i wont post or mention any pt but with so low float and so big Short float **everything is doable with volume**. Share thoughts share anything like i shared mine , and also i have to share my memeish feeling of the stock since day 1. Somewhere my eye caught a quote i liked - its better to be in a Meme before it becomes one (unknown - 2021)! First time such an all star team behind the wheel with so many followers behind them thats the fact. Shorts already seems to be in trouble into my eyes. **DEEP VALUE** my fellow apes rangers Ogs whatever you like. Everyone likes the stock it seems in social and you know the power of social media from Kitty.

**Tip---> No pumpers (yet) on $BODY its a pure fundamental - growth - behemoth of a company that offers huge potential to investors in early stages. They target triple digits and they are capable of as a team.**

**Also dont forget $BODY rings the bell this Monday 28/6.**

Big thanks for taking some parts from the DD of Traditional-Studio-5 and some other BB followers. Any mistake i may not have seen please contact me to fix it asap since i double checked. Sorry for any typos also. Enjoy!"
2021-06-25 22:54:59,wallstreetbets,I made good money on the spac earlier this year and got out during the crash. Bought 2000 shares and 1000 warrants last week and they’re up 20% already. This hit $18 earlier this year without WSB. $BODY is going to fly 🚀 🚀 🚀

2021-06-26 19:28:04,wallstreetbets,"I've included a few links below to how Beachbody on Demand Interactive (BODi) will look like. This is their new fitness platform launching in September 2021. They will still have their world leading collection of fitness videos which can be streamed for $99/year, but BODi now allows subscribers to engage directly with coaches and other trainees for an additional $19.99 a month. We're going to see a major shift in the way consumers work out over the next decade. It's going to be hard to justify paying hundreds or thousands of dollars to a trainer at a brick and mortar gym when you can just engage with a multitude of trainers directly at home for $20 a month.

Post-merger, I can't see any other company besides Peloton that could compete with them on interactive fitness given all three (3) of their platforms can cover a different segment of the online fitness market. 

1. Bodi
2. Myxfitness
3. MyOpenFit"

2021-06-26 00:31:49,wallstreetbets,"So is the only path to growth through M&A? That's going to burn cash fast and only lead to further dilution etc. to raise more equity.

Sounds like their core business - as is - is not sufficient to keep them growing, basically is plateauing if I read you right, and the only way forward is to aggressively M&A. The latter can be a double edged sword as any M&A that doesn't bring the desired growth means the share will take a hit at quarterly earnings.

also, you mention they've been around for many years. Isn't it concerning that they haven't been going anywhere those many years?

finally, getting celebs on board is usually a cheap marketing ploy, doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Those guys are only lending out their names to give free publicity to the company."
2021-06-26 03:13:59,wallstreetbets,Theres no short squeeze here. But its a good long term play.

People are trying to spread the word about BODY atm since it's relatively unknown, so it can look shill-ish, but for me personally I do see potential in the stock. It's a bit like Nautilus but with more ready-made subscribers and equipment.

I'm no pro, so I can only give my opinion based on my research."
2021-06-26 00:45:21,wallstreetbets,Surprised you didn’t get downvoted for speaking so rational
2021-06-26 02:36:16,wallstreetbets,Because my bro i had no karma needed to post this DD so i needed people and new investors to know about it. So i asked for some upvotes to get the karma i needed!

2021-06-26 07:05:27,wallstreetbets,Why it really has the potential and thats a fact you cant deny if you read this part. Its higly possible scenario.

2021-06-26 02:39:07,wallstreetbets,I think its at bottom still. Imo showed real strength last 2 days. IF they start covering we wont see these prices again.Also as i mentioned on post noone has the intention to sell.

With 3 million paid subscribers, nutrition and worldwide expansion going nowhere? Also why would Shaq Arnold And Lebron would invest in a company without future? These 3 are not cheap marketing my friend this is the real deal ."
2021-06-26 02:29:45,wallstreetbets,"I completely see your points regarding this stock, and I personally don't see this company ever coming up to PTON's level, but it could easily get to Nautilus's level which is a 2-3x bagger (within a year or possibly around merger). They also have a headstart on Nautilus with content, subscribers and equipment.

Beachbody has been around for years, and I'd say that, although they have a lot of subscribers and have managed to operate with free cash flow, yeah, they plateaued. They had some big successes like P90x and Insanity, but the company style became quite outdated and didn't make the pivot online as well or quickly as they could have.

However, what makes me bullish is that they are now entering a growth tech field at bargain basement prices, and, importantly, have the ex-Disney+ and Tik Too CEOs guiding it. I wouldn't be investing if it was only the original Beachbody CEO doing it since I don't think they could do the pivot well enough. I'm looking to see a brand image overhaul and plenty of marketing. 

I think $BODY will have to be aggressive with growth at first, and yeah, this could reduce profits for a couple years like it did for PTON, but for me it still has great potential for stock price growth in the current market. I also that they have their content and equipment ready with established sales history in place. As long as PTON is doing well, I see good reason to get excited for this one.

(Edit: Formatting)"
2021-06-26 03:15:16,wallstreetbets,Future will say :)
2021-06-26 02:12:53,wallstreetbets,"Not OP, but I have 1,200 shares at an average of $10.37 right now. I plan to buy more with a view to long-term if it dips post-merger. If it moons I'll be taking profit incrementally on the way up.

I found the stock through DD on PTON (which is in my post history). 

I would have included BODY in that DD as a potential competitor, but sub rules there didn't allow SPACs. Fortunately, it's no longer a SPAC. I hope this helps."

While it's true this stock has a very high percentage short interest and there's always the chance that could happen, I'm not in it with a view to a squeeze, but based on its genuine potential and value as a company. I like this stock, and I was also in GME in January (which was an amazing ride)."

2021-06-26 02:01:37,wallstreetbets,"I think it just takes a high percentage of short interest. If a large percentage of the float is shorted, and buyers start relentlessly pushing it up, it gets a boost/squeeze as short positions are forced to cover at higher prices.

The higher the short percentage, the higher the potential of a squeeze. Above 20% is considered extremely high. It probably gets volatile though because it's in the interest of shorts to push the price down so they can cover at a lower price."

2021-06-26 00:25:05,wallstreetbets,They have subreddits here. Just depends how you feel about their business model since it's not all an MLM they have direct to consumer and you don't even have to be an active shiller in their coach network to use the workouts and the product itself gets good reviews even if the coaches are insufferable.
2021-06-26 08:50:55,wallstreetbets,You can’t buy product as a coach and hold it like a typical mlm. You can sign people up to be a coach but it isn’t pyramid style

2021-06-26 10:32:09,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I'll look into it a bit more.

My only advice is to try and think of the bear case on this one, and only after you have satisfied yourself that the price is still fair under a bear case to go in long and heavy. I'm not looking to dissuade anyone, but as a practice, if you have considered the bear thesis and you still find the stock good value, then it's the best of both worlds, because then you will have strong conviction you have bought at a (near) bottom price.

Thanks again"

Though you have to take what’s here with a grain of salt when it was less than 500k people it was fine but after the GME thing you even have media types in here which is weird."

Be advised: I’m not a sat com expert, nor is this investment advice and I really have no Idea what I'm doing here.

Also, I should say Price Targets for GSAT range wildly, I've seen targets over $200 per share floated around with some pretty impressive analysis behind it, but more conservatively I'm in line with suggestions it COULD be $30-$50 if and when all goes well in a very optimal scenario, and it seems there's a much broader consensus on a 7$ to 10$ target in the near term.

GSAT owns c band and s band spectrum, which with the push to 5G and Internet of Things has suddenly become incredibly valuable. Recent FCC auctions will attest to this.

For years, GSAT was waiting for FCC authorization on that spectrum, but by the time they got it, they had issues with debt and investors were wary to jump in without a clear Monetization plan for their spectrum. The heavy debt situation has since been resolved, giving them enough of a cash runway to continue in for the next three years. Their business model during most of the past decade involved satellite phones and gps tracking, which, with their aging satellites and limited market for that kind of stuff, was never meant to do much more than keep the lights on while they waited for the value of their spectrum to appreciate. Their share price languished under $1 for a long time until 2021, when a couple things started to shift. They partnered with Nokia to set up a secure redundant 5G node for the port of Seattle, with more similar collaborations likely down the line. Then, most recently, QCOM announced that their x65 next generation snapdragon modem, which is the most popular smartphone modem in the world, will connect to the n53 band specifically. GSAT owns this band of spectrum, nobody else. QCOM obviously did that for a reason, but as of now, there’s no widespread usage of that spectrum as it’s not really being used except by GSAT SPOT devices and phones, which is to say, hardly at all.

Exactly what that means for GSAT is unclear, but what it does mean is that within a few years, millions of devices around the world will have the ability to connect to their spectrum.

There’s a lot of DD out there breaking down price targets, but the truth is nobody knows, and the CEO and other execs have shown an incredible amount of patience and personal investment in terms of allowing their spectrum assets to appreciate while putting their own money on the line to keep things afloat over the years.

Starlink, AT&T, Verizon should all be interested in buying, and have probably all made offers or overtures, but GSAT has not bitten, even when they needed the money. Which also suggests that the company is not interested in a sale. And indeed, leasing the spectrum might be far more lucrative than an outright sale, and better for shareholders.

I won't bother describing the different possible monetization strategies here, as I've linked to a report published by Nokia at the bottom of this post that does a much better job than I could.

GSATs spectrum is sometimes compared to a large swath of undeveloped beachfront property in the middle of South Beach, completely clean and unsullied in the middle of an increasingly crowded and frenzied space.

They look like a penny stock at first glance but they are far from it, and it may be the ultimate 5G play.

You might ask: What about Musk’s Starlink? Aren’t they going to eat GSAT’s lunch?

EDIT: This is better addressed in a comment by u/squishjonesjr:

""Starlink use Ku band for their user terminal links and Ka for the gateway links, they wont need any spectrum in C-band. Also doubt they would purchase spectrum to ensure others cant use it, their main focus is not going bankrupt. Their initial constellation will cost ~$10B and could be much higher if more sats are needed (filed for up to 15k sats). Not to mention their gen 1 sats have a useful life of 5 years so they will have to replace those soon after service start.""

-u/squishjonesjr

Starlink probably doesn’t need GSAT spectrum, and for our purposes, GSAT is not really in competition with Starlink, as their current business model (which will be affected by Starlink) is not the source of the stocks theoretcal valuation. but if someone DID want to compete with Starlink, they would need to access GSAT assets. Which is another reason why Starlink might need to get there first, not because they need it but because they dont want anyone else to have it.

Starlink is a possible buyer for GSAT, not for their satellites but for their spectrum. The value of GSAT is NOT in its satellites or the ground units, its in the spectrum.

DISH is another possible buyer for GSAT.

Some people point to debt issues with GSAT . It’s true the company has diluted its shares quite a bit to remain solvent over the years, but they currently have enough cash on hand to give them a three year runway. It would make ZERO sense for another offering to occur BEFORE a major monetization event for the spectrum, and since this is 5G, that monetization event is going to happen WELL before they run out of cash.

Another issue often raised: “The FCC can just seize spectrum and reallocate it if they want, that’s what happened to (insert late 90’s early 2000’s Sat company here)

These other companies, from what I understand, had major issues with solvency, and so they basically went to the FCC to see what kind of deal they could get if they surrendered it to be reallocated. BTW, I’ve learned that the correct way to talk about spectrum is not as something that GSAT owns or holds but as something they currently control.

Seems Risky?

Betting on the value of Globalstar spectrum WAS a risky play, but now that QCOM has legitimized the value of the n53 band (albeit not explicitly or specifically in terms of eventual use case) by including it in the next gen snapdragon's connectivity ability, the risk associated with the play has diminished a great deal.

The bear case of the QCOM aspect of all this is that including n53 connectivity is more of a marketing trick than something they imagine will actually get used, but given that n53 is extraordinarily underutilized at this point, even that scenario implies that QCOM expects to see expanded usage of that band in the short term.

Also I thought it was interesting that Nokia would publish this on their website: https://www.nokia.com/blog/case-globalstar-6-ways-leverage-spectrum-asset/

From Nokia:

“Nokia customer Globalstar Inc., a U.S. based provider of mobile satellite voice and data services, is in the enviable position of having 2.4 GHz spectrum that works everywhere, meaning it has been globally allocated. 2.4 GHz spectrum is in the sweet spot from a physics perspective because it’s good for both coverage and capacity. Although it’s not yet a 3GPP standardized spectrum band, it has been approved by the Federal Communications Commission and recently in other countries. It’s remarkably clean meaning it’s clear, has no co-channel interference and provides network benefits for both indoor and outdoor deployments.

Globalstar turned to Nokia to help determine the band characteristics for its available spectrum and identify potential application options. Nokia’s Network Planning and Optimization (NPO) team conducted a small cell network study of Globalstar’s 2.4 GHz spectrum as compared to a similar HetNet network in 2.1 GHz. The study proved the versatility of Globalstar’s spectrum, showing that operators with a small cell network could benefit from Globalstar’s clean spectrum, while those without small cell networks could benefit from its huge capacity.

In our study, Globalstar’s spectrum outperformed outdoor small cell deployments by 20%, while requiring 33% less infrastructure. For indoors in an urban office environment, we were able to deploy approximately half the access points required since the band has no interference from macro towers operating in the same frequency. The full report can be seen here. The team went a step further to also provide six business model options for Globalstar to consider.

“We were excited to work with Nokia’s NPO experts to help determine how to best monetize and maximize the use cases of our spectrum asset so we can deliver the highest quality experience to the end users,” said Jay Monroe, chairman and CEO of Globalstar.

6 ways to monetize & maximize the spectrum

1.Lease the spectrum to incumbent operators – This provides extra capacity for operators and uses their own RAN equipment and services. Operators can use clean spectrum without incumbrance and it supports standard capabilities like Carrier Aggregation, roaming and redirection. For Globalstar, this is a simple revenue model without any operational burdens.

2.Dedicated in-building small cell spectrum – The analysis clearly shows the difficulties presented by macro interference to small cell deployments. Offering a dedicated, clean spectrum band would dramatically improve the performance of these HetNets and significantly reduce the cost to deploy them. Globalstar could lease the spectrum to one carrier nationwide or carriers in geographic regions that wanted to reduce the strain on their expensive macro tower infrastructure.

3.Use the spectrum as a satellite service enhancement – By deploying RANs in Globalstar’s high use areas, such as air terminals, shipping ports, military bases or cargo handling facilities, Globalstar can both provide satellite offload and support high data rates and advanced applications. Enhanced services are provided to customers where they normally congregate, and for these customers there is a layer of satellite redundancy in the event of disruptions in terrestrial networks.

4.Lease spectrum for private LTE systems to non-carriers – Cable companies are increasingly interested in pursuing wireless services themselves. Globalstar’s spectrum provides an opportunity to add a private LTE network on top of their dense cable plant. Alternatively, as the in-building networks are further developed there may be an opportunity to include Globalstar’s band as a private LTE service on top of neutral host models.

5.Directly provide private services to enterprises – By offering private LTE systems directly to enterprises, Globalstar provides spectrum, equipment and services to end user customers, which provides direct control over the user experience and maximizes private LTE system revenue opportunities. These deployments of Globalstar’s spectrum could be done while several of these other options are pursued simultaneously.

6.Mass market product enablement licensing – Globalstar could license spectrum to ODM manufacturers for use in mass market. This would include unrestricted use and products distributed globally. This option could address the Internet of Things or Connected Car markets.

No matter what Globalstar decides to do, Nokia will be there to partner with them – in the U.S. and around the world. We are also lending our support to the 3GPP standardization process and equipment manufacturing enablement, which are critical for the spectrum’s success."

2021-06-25 21:45:47,wallstreetbets,"Except there needs to be a buyer willing to bid them. Go to a stock and look at the options volume for some deep OTM calls and see what that volume is. It is normally very low. Not impossible to sell low, but pretty low.

Also if you look at the bid/ask spread for TWTR for these, it's sometimes over  a dollar per contract. So these ""gains"" are not as good as they appear. 

For instance the 145C says he has a profit of around 1200 with a mark of 2.25, but the bid is actually 2.00 and the ask is 2.51 (the mark being the average). So he could only sell these for 2.00 a contact and his profit would be quite a bit lower.

The 125C has a bid that is over 50 cents lower than the mark! The ask is 5.15 and the bid 3.90."

u/POTUSBIDEN YW, NOBEL PRIZE PLS

&#x200B;

**LAZY READERS SKIP THIS:**

For the bears who want a pull back so they can eat, you can have a pull back, after a run up. But stonks only go up, so why not just play the house side?

For the haters that arn't American or don't like being #1, go buy some Gourd or something.

For those of you who don't know what's happening, why are stocks going up. Here's how come stocks are going higher. You really need to paint the whole world into this picture in order to understand how critical the stock market plays for not only the US but every other country in the world.

&#x200B;

**LAZY READERS SKIP THIS:**

What makes the US stock market so incredible is that it is literally too large to fail. In the whole world, the most money invested is in the US stock market.

Do we invest in the US stock market because interest rates are at null? YES

Do we invest in the US stock market because of growth? YES

Do we invest in the US stock market because of dividends? YES

Do we invest in the US stock market because of fear of inflation? YES

&#x200B;

Now, we may wonder, or I wonder at times. Wouldn't the stock market crash if inflation is here and the FEDS raise rates? No there won't be a crash but a slow bleed because investors might try to find somewhere else to put their money and get more lucrative gains. Like WSB banned currency. For me I don't really like the wild wild west where you can have someone else blow up your account for you.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**READ HERE:**

**Hurry up! What's the big picture you said we're missing?**

Well you see.... the **US of A** has a lot of debt backed by the American dollar. The dollar falling 10% during this short-term inflationary period with no interest is actually favorable. The US actually owes 10% less debt than it did before.

What you don't know is that this is that interest rates don't need to rise to counter inflation. If the FEDS wanted a stronger dollar to counter inflation, they can start repaying some of these debts. With the debts paid in USD as you print more money through more stimulus packages and reverse repos. These weights balance out.

&#x200B;

Step 1.) Printer goes BRRRRRR (Dollar goes down), reverse repo goes Reeeee (FEDS pay a 0.5% interest lulz to banks and save the  ~~USA~~  WORLD, WORTH!)

Step 2.) Use money to stimulated economic recovery and development (Long term USD recovery)

Step 3.) Use money to pay debts (Short term USD brace and debt offset) (Those high rates are gone)

**Step 4.)** ????????\*

Step 5.) US ECONOMY HEALTHY AF AND EVERYONE IS RICH FROM STONKS. BANKS get 0.5% interest.

&#x200B;

**Step 4 explained**) What really happens here is the USD debt paid to countries are in USD. This USD need to be spent or put somewhere. Other countries most often and most likely will need to park their deflating USD into the stock market. The US STOCK MARKET. You heard it here first.

&#x200B;

Yes, this could inflate an inflated stock market since the whole world will be more invested in the US stock market. Implying a pop would happen would screw everyone. STONKS ONLY GO UP.

&#x200B;

**TLDR: STONKS TOO BIG TO FAIL, PLAN D (Debt) STILL NOT ACTIVATED.**

&#x200B;

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Did you Drink the Meme Stonk Kool-Aid? Time to wash it down with some good ol’ (K)entucky (H)ighed (C)hicken and let the tendies start busting in like the Kool-Aid Man. I’m getting really tired of people and media talking about “drinking the meme stock Kool-Aid”, like YES BOOMER, I sure fuckin’ did and I will do it again, damnit! Who tf doesn’t like Kool-Aid? 

That got me thinking about investing in actual Kool-Aid.

1. Kids love this shit. Drink it, dye their hair with it, whatever. Doesn’t matter. This is a fundamental beverage to the experience of American childhood. 
2. Jonestown. Did you know it wasn’t even Kool-Aid used at this massacre? It was Flavor Aid which is basically the 1978 equivalent of ordering Kool-Aid from WISH.
3. The mascot be busting through some walls and I could really use some of that BDE in my portfolio. 
4. Purple is a flavor and this is proven by both Kool-Aid and those frozen ice pops that slice the sides of your face up like they’re trying to turn you into The Joker.

With my Kool-Aid thesis in hand, I trace this shit back to the parent company and start getting excited. We got ketchup, mac n cheese, fancy fucking mustard, cream cheese, and a commitment to ecologically friendly practices by 2025. IS THERE EVEN A DOWNSIDE TO THIS COMPANY? 

Yes, in the interest of fair and balanced research, there is and I believe the biggest danger to this company’s growth is that unpronounceable condiment Worcestershire sauce, and fish. I know damn well this sauce is like the dark magic cooking secret and it’s fundamental when you have to trick a date into thinking you can cook but the problem lies in the useless ingredient that substantially ups the cost production while excluding a growing market of vegetarians. Lea & Perrins has brand name recognition but they insist on including anchovies in all their recipes. This is dumb and literally useless. An off brand with all the same ingredients except the anchovies tastes exactly the same and is friendly to vegetarians as well as folks who just think it’s weird to put fish gratuitously in things. The only reason it’s even still in there is tradition because it was supposed to be a fish sauce and *failed*. Essentially they are paying tribute to an idea that didn’t turn out to be relevant at all. I don’t believe the company will address this huge blunder and is likely to bleed profits from this particular weak point until it is addressed. BUT, I still believe my Kool-Aid thesis benefits outweigh this one fixable downside and so I will elaborate on each of the four benefits listed above. Kids love this shit. Teens love this shit. Gamers who can’t afford Mountain Dew so they have to mix a drink in the empty bottle love this shit. Grandmas love this shit. Nobody is going to stop drinking the Kool-Aid. Which leads to point two. How do we absolutely know that nobody is going to stop drinking this wonderful beverage where every flavor is better described as a color? Jonestown is how, beeches. This drink company survived one of the worse PR nightmares in all of history and kept right on chugging for *forty plus* more years. In case you don’t know, the Jonestown massacre was when a crazy cult dude convinced all his followers to drink poison. It was horrifying in every possible way. The method of delivery for this poison cocktail was Flavor Aid, a cheap off brand competitor. From a PR perspective this is doubly awful because Kool Aid was completely innocent but you can’t exactly call up the newspaper and be like “Hey buddy, I know this is a fucking terrible tragedy but could you please release a statement saying it wasn’t us they used and was actually a competitor?” Because how fucking petty is that shit. Makes you look awful even though you, nor your competitor, had anything at all to do with it. If Kool-Aid can survive that, what can’t they survive??? 

That brings us to the Kool-Aid Man. I like the cut of his jib, just busting through walls all wildly-nilly whenever he pleases. This anthropomorphic asshole is definitely going to drive up costs on building materials like steel and lumber and I’m long on CLF because that CEO spouted off on short sellers 2 years ago. Never mind that I only saw the video 2 weeks ago, I’m long on it now. Bring me some tendies, ohhhhhhh yeaaaaahhhhhhh. 

My last point is flavor profile. Purple is a flavor. Blue is a flavor. Green is a flavor. We’re hold these truths to be self-evident. Purple doesn’t taste like a grape, I’ve had a lot of grapes and nothing about them tastes like purple. Blue “raspberry”? Fuck you, I’ve seen a lot of raspberries and you know what color they aren’t? BLUE. Because blue IS the flavor. I’m tired of this myth being perpetuated that these color flavors have any resemblance to fruit. They don’t. I’m long on purple and blue because those are the best. Red can go fuck itself, puts on that shit. TLDR; I drank the metaphorical Kool-Aid so I might as well invest in the actual makers of Kool-Aid."

&#x200B;

Okay, you really only need that TL;DR to know this is a golden nugget of a stock. But I understand, I'm also a smooth brain, I also need images to be able to understand something.

https://preview.redd.it/eztpm2171h771.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=8143b2429204d3ed3ed2cda47b3a743db074325b

Look at those ridiculous margins. At the end of the day, this is a software business. Weedmaps provides the platform for dispensaries to market their goods (like Shopify) and the infrastructure to deliver those goods to their customers, who are loyal AF. I'm one of them. The growth of the weed industry reminds me of the gold rush and by that perspective, Weedmaps has created the market for selling gold. It's an even better play than selling shovels.

AND, there are a TON of upcoming catalysts with states legalizing cannabis left and right. Basically every state has either already legalized or has some bill in the works to legalize cannabis. You live under a rock if you haven't been hearing about all of this.

Next, we look at these weed ETFs. Right now, the only weed ETF that has Weedmaps is CNBS. This is a TON of untapped buying pressure as these ETFs add this name to their portfolios.

Lastly, the SQUEEZE. The beautiful fucking squeeze potential.

Now this data hasn't been updated, but we can say for certain that there are shorts on this stock. The thing to note here is the days to cover, because the daily volume on this stock is PUNY. This is a company with a market cap >2B and the amount traded per day is anywhere from $4-8M. Yes, you read that right, that's the dollar amount of volume traded. Just check the volume for today or any of the past days, IT'S TINY. It's the perfect cocktail for a squeeze.

&#x200B;

**If this stock rises too fast, these shorts are legit going to be trapped because it would take fucking ages for them to close out their shorts. JUMP ABOARD THIS 🚀**

2021-06-26 02:26:43,wallstreetbets,"Don't buy this stock until you see how far off their 2021YE revenue numbers they are. No way in hell they're going to make it with the C-Suite turnover and employee attrition everywhere from Sales to Marketing. All their clients hate them and think theyre price gouging with very few outside of Southern California finding value in their products. Think about it, once you find a dispensary how often do you go back to searching for it? Unlike Yelp where there's an infinite and revolving door of restaurants, dispensaries are more akin to drugstores where once you find one that's close to you, you don't need to ""discover"" one again through their services - you'll just go direct to the store. And anyone in the Cannabis knows their other business ventures are a joke that are easily outclassed by their competitors. They're not really a thing in other legalized states, especially onces that have been legal longer than California so what makes you think they'll be able to get their act together if the entire US opened up?"

For example I bought a shit load of Spy calls on the 18th when it took a giant shit. I sold Thursday this week for a really nice profit of like 10k. Of course, this Friday it climbs even higher, so I definitely left money on the table. But fuck it, I made money, that particular trade is over. And its just as likely I would have diamondhanded it even more and this Monday it might crash and I end up losing more money, you just don't know, you can't play the what if game.

This is especially important on the opposite side when your trade takes a monster 15 hit combo to the downside. Get OUT, stop hoping for the miracle, exit, retreat, re-strategize."

Luckily it hasn't gotten me into any trouble, but activities I've done while in this state:

1. I did it on Wednesday of this week, where for some reason I was drunk and went to buy a bag of Cocaine(on a Wednesday night lol?) at about 1AM and ended up hanging out at my dealer's house until about 4AM having deep conversations. Didn't end up going to bed until about 5AM. Had a relatively big meeting the next day.
2. Drove an hour to the casino at 3AM and played blackjack on a Thursday night until about 7AM. Then drove back in morning rush hour traffic feeling like absolute garbage. I never go to the casino.
3. Ended up going through the hooker ads and drove to some hooker in a shady motel at about 4AM on a Saturday night. Was creepy as fuck, and then after getting an unsuccessful BJ from her I ended up agreeing to drive her and her roommate to buy crack on a Sunday morning at 7AM. 

Keep in mind, I am a successful businessman who is attractive and relatively well-liked. No idea why, but Ambien unlocks some shit in your phyche that just doesn't exist in your normal personality."

Basically, debt has never been so cheap to finance for shitty companies which have no reason to continue to exist. Most of them barely earn enough to cover their interest payments. If Treasury yields go higher, so does their debt financing cost. And the risk of them defaulting. Fed is not gonna allow that - and it raises the risk of unemployment going up. My bet is Fed is going to continue to do QE for a long time. As Milton Friedman said: nothing more permanent than a temporary federal program. If yields stay in the current levels or go lower or even negative, precious metals should outperform as they compete with lower real yields. What about stocks? I mean lower yield should support higher stock prices. But if inflation picks up, stock returns become unattractive. Don't think we are going to see SPX returns outperforming in 2020s as compared to 2010s."

Everyone was excited about the prospect of a spike upwards at the EOD market today. That didn't happen. What did happen was a spike of 14 MILLION shares at precisely 12:59:59pm (or 3:59:59pm EST), with NO change in share price.

  
Can anyone shed light on this? How is it possible that a spike of 14 MILLION shares occurred in the last second of trading with 0 effects on the share price?

2021-06-26 12:44:42,wallstreetbets,"I kind of want to make a post about using TA to day trade FD’s. Mostly on SPY and QQQ, but it would work on high volume stocks as well. 

A lot of people shit on TA but don’t seem to understand that it’s not a Crystal ball but a line to gage reactions. Things don’t have to bounce at support and don’t have to sell at resistance. 

The neat thing is you can know when you’re wrong rather quickly. Especially day trading on a 1 minute. Why would I do that you may ask? Well except for buying leaps (really one of the most successful strats for smooth brain options newbs) I like day trading FD’s. 
1 because they’re cheap.
2 I don’t have to hold something overnight and lose sleep over it. (For real if you do this long enough you’ll really start to appreciate that aspect.) 
3 if my leaps are taking a shit it’s something I can do to keep my account up so I don’t get annoyed or upset and consider selling them. Though you should always have an exit strat, 

Anyway let me know if anyone would find that interesting, Probably save hours of your life trying to watch random YouTube videos. 

Don’t reeee at me. I won’t debate you in the usefulness of ta or anything though. Sorry if the one article you read about a retard trying it for a week and said it doesn’t work put you off."

I was pants less, and the gentle breeze blowing in through the farmhouse window chilled my insides. I stared down at the floor and she put on her latex gloves. She pet my back very gently and came in real close to say, 

“Good milk starts with the cow.”

I responded with a “moo”

She proceeded to milk me, slowly at first, then more quickly. I could tell she was in a rush, but that wouldn’t be a problem. I was helpless to her touch, and overwhelmed by the moment, I released my milk. 

She checked the bucket and sighed. “Not enough for dinner.” She began milking again. It was uncomfortable at first and I began to sweat. I let our a mournful “moo” but she only quickened her pace. I started counting cracks on the floorboards, but was once again overtaken by my senses. I let out a pitiful cry and released a little more milk. 

She sighed, clearly disappointed in today’s harvest. She took the bucked and left. I stared from my stable at the other cows, a little embarrassed. Their blank eyes looked on me judgingly."

The last two weeks were rough. 6/9 through 6/21, I went from my ATH in my account to sweating every close if I would stay above 25k since I already got flagged for PDT. Held that shit through it all even though I had to roll some 7/9 calls to 7/23 since SPCE always likes to break news at the last second possible. When I woke up and checked my phone, I saw that it was at $45 and couldn't believe it. Checked the news, and there was that FAA approval I'd been dying to see for the last week. I took some profits, but will probably buy back in on Monday depending on what happens next. What a ride."

Markets DO NOT react because it's a fucking Monday or it's a fucking Friday. Just because it's Friday DOES NOT mean it will automatically be a sell off red day. Also just because it's Monday it doesn't  mean it will be a roaring green day. If markets worked like that and it was that easy everyone would be billionaires but were not.

About 10 minutes later I felt that bastard crawling on my leg again. I once again attempted to smash him on the floor. I even saw what I thought was a small blood smear. Then I flicked him across the room. About twenty minutes after that, there he was again, crawling up my leg. I took him and flushed him down the toilet.

2021-06-26 15:23:26,wallstreetbets,"Here is how I see CLOV ending. 

Bank of America is the short seller here. 

I am not sure what they are doing by shorting this excessively but they are probably trying to end the fiscal quarter without recording a massive loss from CLOV maybe even booking a profit. 

Also share lockup expire July and insiders can convert their class B shares to class A and sell. 

This will increase the float and lower the borrowing cost at wish point if I was in BOA I would keep selling short. 

Basically if CLOV does not squeeze before beginning of July there is going to be some trouble for buyers. 

If the squeeze happen before share lockup expire than we’re at a very good place because as the stock price rise there will be new investors entering. Basically what happens with AMC. Insiders keep selling but it doesn’t effect price because new investors are buying expecting a squeeze."

2021-06-25 21:14:11,wallstreetbets,"JPOW and Yellen betting on 3 things to go right together:

Deficit spending without bond yields going higher and no dollar devaluation. That's a narrow road to go down.

In order for deficit to not cause bond yields to go higher, would mean it somehow doesn't cause inflation. But inflation in many cases is a product of growth. Inflation will not rise if the growth, as an outcome of deficit spending, doesn't go up. Whole thing is puzzling.

In case deficit spending goes on and inflation picks, Fed might be able to help jump in and do QE to keep rates artificially low. But this will result in dollar devaluation. Which is also not good, because US is a net importer rather than exporter.

Deficit spending can also be funded with substantial tax hikes. Especially on the upper band. But this might result in misallocation of capital.

Damn. Next couple of years are gonna be a nail bitter.

The stock market, with its gains over the last 11 years, is hardly in a goldilocks situation for any of these scenarios."

2021-06-26 12:48:10,wallstreetbets,"Inflation causes prices to raise according to the % of money printed

The tricky thing, is the prices mainly rise amongst hard capped assets. Houses, stocks, commodities. If 40% of total currency is printed in a given year. Consumer goods may rise 10%, while commodities rise 60-70%. It will reach equilibrium, as you cannot increase net wealth through printing

What this means, is the more assets you hold, the better you are under inflation. If 90% of your wealth is in assets, and assets rise 60%, while 40% of money is printed. You have gained 55% wealth. Making you have a larger slice of the pie.

Inflation is awful for everybody but the asset class

2021-06-26 18:14:51,wallstreetbets,"I think the next decade is going to be more about fiscal policy than monetary policy. Washington will try to address the problem of wealth inequality with tax hikes. UBI might become a more permanent phenomenon. Even inflation might be allowed to go higher. The US GDP is consumer driven primarily. So if it continues like how it did in 2010s, the consumer gets weakened. When normal people are not able to grow their income, not able to afford houses, the economy crumbles down. And so does the stock market eventually. So the next decade might be about prioritizing main street over wall street. In conclusion: poor stock market returns, but a strengthening economy. Value will probably outperform growth."

For real buy puts at a strike at the bottom of the nearest gap. ( a gap is the distance where it closed a previous day and opened the next. If price doesn’t go down there to fill the gap intraday then we have an open gap.) 

For instance we have a gap between 425.55 and 425.15. Then another at 422.50 and 424.73. 

Finding strikes at these lows a few months out makes your odds better. July is usually bullish so if you wanna fight the trend don’t get greedy,"

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My CRSR Technical analysis for next week. Strength:

* Price is higher higher and above 10, 20 and 50 SMA
* OBV is above 0
* RSI is rising above 60
* The $35 options chain exp on July 16 looks promising

Weakness:

* The low trade volume is concerning

Opportunity:

* On June 28, if price reached $35, then next target could fill the gap at $35.76

Threat:

* It could repeat a same history as June 3.

I bought the option.

\*\* This is not financial advice \*\*

EDIT During the last 15 min of trading, the $40 and the $42.5 option chain volume increased 87%

2021-06-25 22:35:10,wallstreetbets,Wkhs definatley can make a lot of us money. That’s the main point of this stock. As for when it’ll squeeze nobody can say exactly could be next week or next month. Too many factors at play. If we gain traction i believe it could happen any day now. But we’ve got enough people holding to keep the value roughly where it’s been last two weeks and shorts are losing money every day that we continue to hold
2021-06-25 20:30:50,wallstreetbets,The numbers in your fake screenshot do not add up.

2021-06-26 03:09:31,wallstreetbets,What’s their profit margin? 20/30%? Even if it’s 100% then that’s surely still a loss.
2021-06-26 04:02:09,wallstreetbets,"I mean, you're talking fundamentals as if everyone doesn't know that this is a squeeze play. SI is over 60% the highest. Momentum is picking up. When did this sub become all about long term plays. Nobody gives a shit about it's long term potential right now."

Jesus Christ you people see one guy make a bunch of money and don’t realize options are the only thing where your money can go to ZERO just like that. Swing trading is good enough for me. It’s risky enough to be fun but I know for a fact no company of mine is gonna go to zero.

Theirs real competition and they have infrastructure.   They also have something Tesla is horrible at.  Service.   We’ve had a Tesla now for 4 years.   The cars amazing.  But the service is a total joke.   Your car will come back in worse shape and with problems and they’ll sloppily get you out the door.  Tried 3 centers and know a ton of other owners all same treatment.  But like i said and pointed out theirs no catalyst to assist that type of movement now. And without a catalyst you can hope for $800 but you won’t see it hit $4000 like before.
2021-06-25 20:53:41,wallstreetbets,"Ah, well shit."
2021-06-26 13:55:36,wallstreetbets,Been here before I’ve learned to deal with it. I’ll be ok.

2021-06-25 21:25:34,wallstreetbets,Don’t ever let that hold you from selling. They can always remove the flag but you cannot get your unrealized gains back..
2021-06-25 20:17:07,wallstreetbets,don't you feel protected? next just throw 25k cash over there and off you go.
2021-06-25 21:23:18,wallstreetbets,Explain
2021-06-25 21:49:34,wallstreetbets,"Thought about it then the stock began to slump and I was basically locked in. 

693 came fast this morning and went just as fast as it came it was impossible to sell for any gain."
2021-06-25 20:19:28,wallstreetbets,Haha I wish man money doesn’t come that easy over here.
2021-06-26 00:52:22,wallstreetbets,Say you own the tsla 690c but you stupid and forgot you’re out of daytrades so you would sell to open the next strike up like the 695c for the same date for some credit then you can close the entire spread the next day.
2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,We eating steak and lobster for dinner tonight boys 
2021-06-25 21:12:26,wallstreetbets,I just wonder what gaining so much feels like. I can’t catch a break but it’s exciting to see you guys doin it up
2021-06-25 20:40:29,wallstreetbets,"I mean technically you gotta sell them to then buy the steak and lobster but I like your vibe, great play! Rooting for ya for this to head into itm next week."

2021-06-26 18:25:37,wallstreetbets,"In the Navy, when you get steak and lobster you know you're about to hear some bad news. Like, deployment extended another 4 months bad news."
2021-06-26 09:28:00,wallstreetbets,It's 10k
2021-06-26 12:34:10,wallstreetbets,Honestly it can be more panic inducing than losing.  You haven't experienced a real battle with FOMO until you get your first lucky hit of unrealized gains and suddenly you have to make the decision of when to bail out before the money train explodes.
2021-06-26 16:06:00,wallstreetbets,The feeling you get when u absolutely know you’re right about something and everyone else doubts you and then it finally comes into fruition and everyone praises you. Almost like an “i told you” feeling but way more satisfying because you actually get something out of it lol
2021-06-25 21:52:25,wallstreetbets,Ban

2021-06-25 20:59:51,wallstreetbets,Branson flying over 4th July weekend? That would be huge.
2021-06-25 22:42:18,wallstreetbets,"I agree, was lucky enough to grab a bunch of $47 strike calls for Aug in the morning (when the stock was at $46 and rising), closed at $56 in the afternoon. True it can keep rising but I'll take that 80% return for a day tyvm."
2021-06-26 05:23:02,wallstreetbets,Good luck timing it
2021-06-26 04:24:09,wallstreetbets,Playing safe is good. Its cool to loose a million but its cooler to manage your losses and focus on the big fat gains with a clear head.
2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Load your puts guys, the UAP report is set to release today and it's about to be a blood bath. For those who are not familiar with the UAP report, the U.S. intelligence community, in conjunction with the Pentagon, is due today to submit a report to Congress on the subject of ""unidentified aerial phenomena"", a fancy word for UFOs. The Pentagon in recent years has released or confirmed the authenticity of video from naval aviators showing enigmatic aircraft exhibiting speed and maneuverability exceeding known aviation technologies.  
 

Rumor has it that the report will disclose that these sightings of UAPs are not human technology. Guys, this is a civilization altering bombshell. I don't know about you, but I'm expecting the worse."
2021-06-25 20:15:48,wallstreetbets,So this explains the pump of SPCA and FAA giving them clearance to fly “passengers” into space.

2021-06-25 20:29:27,wallstreetbets,"Oh, ok. Cool cool, just wanted to clarify."
2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,$PLTRrd Party! Next stop $30??

2021-06-26 16:42:08,wallstreetbets,It's only 10% away from $30 lol.. So you're calling $27 as the top?  Interesting.. And random.
2021-06-26 09:43:52,wallstreetbets,A huge exercise of puts that I sold in the 28 range.
2021-06-26 08:30:44,wallstreetbets,"im down 4k shares at $34 average.

&#x200B;

HOW TF ARE U DOWN FROM $9 IPO?"
2021-06-26 09:46:08,wallstreetbets,"Greed, more or less.  An options play went south.  1k shares is OK to dip my toes in.  An exercise of like 200 puts at the 28 range was not.  Figured it'd recover if I got exercised.  It then went sideways/down for like...  7 months."
2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$AMD, BOOM! Let’s go ITM, 1000 calls at 86/1.30 strike! "

2021-06-25 22:04:41,wallstreetbets,I got July a few July 21 90c and praying there’s a catalyst before hand. Read some good DD here based on unusual volume activity a week before July 21.
2021-06-26 16:15:33,wallstreetbets,"i bought some AMD as well at $82.50 breakout, but jan $82.50 2022 calls for $10 each lol. These can def print but high chance u lose half fast if market stagnates another week."

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Identifying bots on WSB Spotting a bot:

1. Are they suggesting a company that you are not interested in hearing about? Bot

2. Does their advice sound logical and like would it make you money? Definitely a bot

3. Down vote them and if it sticks, they are a bot

4. Look at their account age. After seeing how old their account is, pick a number higher than that. If the age of their account is lower than the number that you just picked; they are a bot! This one can also be applied to karma.

Other signs: lack of crayons, lack of imagery and videos with green arrows edited into them, lack of OG stocks like GME and AMC. Any use of Robinhood is 100% a bot.

If you find a bot immediately report them to mods, if you are lucky and they're suggesting something that mods haven't invested in, their account will be banned very soon.

Congrats, you are now a bot hunter!

2021-06-26 03:53:11,wallstreetbets,The mods are breeding this. It's suspicious that there's easier squeezes out there with much smaller floats than AMC but the mods ban any mention of them. It's weird watching them fly on stocktwits with no mention on wsb
2021-06-25 20:01:24,wallstreetbets,"I think if I was getting any investment ideas or advice from here a bot would be the last of my worries as brokers I all know hire young apprentices to make cold calls back in the day, now pay then to sit on Reddit ALL day in several countries and pump out FUD and bullshit to suck in the rubes to moose pasture mining co's and the like....look up BreX and those clowns are there all day long chasing your savings and 401K's to bail out their shitty bets and I can't believe folks ain't seeing that now!

2021-06-25 20:31:35,wallstreetbets,"From like 100,000-1M users it was at least 50:50 in terms of useful:meme-spam posts. Daily threads were far more varied in what tickers were discussed, technical patterns identified, people posting actual positions they entered and reasons for doing so. 

From like 1M-2M it degenerated rapidly to like 10:90 useful:meme-spam. You'd still get submitted posts that had deep analysis and thoughtful discussion but you could tell people were commenting to get upvotes and those usually were just things like ""HURRR STONKS GO UP"" or something like that. 

Everything past 3M is just completely useless and it's pretty obvious there's bot-swarms used to just promote singular tickers over and over. And with how many new users there are it's completely flooded out any good analysis with endless spam and emojis.

The GME run from the end of last year really accelerated things, but it was already becoming obvious to people that have been around a bit how dumb this sub was actually getting, and a lot of good users just stopped posting because if you didn't post about GME your comments were just buried"

 >Napster is a set of three music-focused online services. It was founded in 1999 as a pioneering peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing Internet software that emphasized sharing digital audio files, typically audio songs, encoded in MP3 format. As the software became popular, the company ran into legal difficulties over copyright infringement. It ceased operations and was eventually acquired by Roxio.

I'm not sure why he would mention this because it's not really relevant.  You don't learn anything about the stock market, you do a ton of math and econometrics.  Almost everyone gets a fellowship (either from their home country or through the school), so its free and you get paid, so starving is definitely not a problem.

All of the people that I went to school with have extremely high IQs and wouldn't willy nilly throw hundreds of thousands of dollars into clov because they have nothing left to lose... They would research the crap out of it and then yolo if they felt it was the right decision for them...

It's been my experience that econ PhDs like to get in pissing matches with one another and they don't like to lose, so I'm not sure what OP's deal is, It seems more like he's throwing a temper tantrum than actually investing.

I'm 100% for a yolo, but not under the circumstances that you're doing it just because you have nothing left to lose..."

2021-06-26 00:32:02,wallstreetbets,No one with $300k is starving. I have a 6 figure salary. Sometimes it doesn't lead off with a 1. And I don't even have a spare $300k to yolo.

2021-06-26 07:56:09,wallstreetbets,"IMO you should have sold 30 Delta straddle 6 weeks out to lower your cost basis on those shares to like $9. But YOLO I guess. 

30 delta at 6 weeks is like a $24 call so it would still have given you plenty of room to run, and if it turns downward on you your cost basis on the shares would have been like $9."
2021-06-26 07:56:49,wallstreetbets,"Econ PhD and yoloing into CLOV. You belong here.

2021-06-26 08:28:05,wallstreetbets,If you got nothing to lose then just give that fat stack to someone who can use it.
2021-06-26 08:28:31,wallstreetbets,"Orrrrrr... here’s an idea you could just put 200k in index funds and get rich as fuck, still have 100k to make sure you never go hungry and stay away from spunking it all on dogshit clov options for attention on Reddit because you attached all your self worth to your wife as opposed to your intelligence, health, personality and success?"
2021-06-26 08:48:20,wallstreetbets,The options portion of this is so small why even buy them? Shares aren't enough to get me going anymore.

2021-06-26 15:30:14,wallstreetbets,Best place to park your money and watch it get a return right now.
2021-06-26 15:54:21,wallstreetbets,That little -6% loss would feed a lot of starving apes dude
2021-06-26 15:57:37,wallstreetbets,Wtf. Dude you are not starving if you have 300k. Go f yourself
2021-06-26 16:02:43,wallstreetbets,Title should read: “Trust Fund baby squanders 300k”
2021-06-26 16:57:40,wallstreetbets,"never seen a post title piss off so many people in this sub.

Fucking hilarious."

I'm happy to do it. 

^(*DISCLAIMER: No, I will not actually kick you in the nuts for money. Fuck is wrong with you. Also, this is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. You can still wire me $10k though, if your just throwing it away, I'll get you that PayPal link.*)"

2021-06-26 07:43:16,wallstreetbets,Apparently shills for HFs are supplied with screen shots like this to persuade people to join pump and dumps. I’m not saying this is the same just that it happens in Reddit

2021-06-25 23:07:57,wallstreetbets,Make him take a selfie with his shirt pulled over his head and write the date and user name on his chest.  If I can't see his ribs he ain't starving
2021-06-26 01:18:55,wallstreetbets,What a retard. Welcome home.
2021-06-25 23:25:15,wallstreetbets,7 Yolo in the past few months. Richest econ whatever I've ever seen.

2021-06-26 16:16:47,wallstreetbets,Yo these mods been getting vicious. I love it.
2021-06-25 23:13:30,wallstreetbets,I know right. “Starving” and “300K’ don’t really go together. Maybe if you’re Venezuelan.
2021-06-25 22:32:10,wallstreetbets,You might be if you work for Citadel. Or they’re just so out of touch with reality that they think PhD students have 300k
2021-06-25 23:23:36,wallstreetbets,Maybe he ate ramen every night to get where he is and his wife left him because she got tired of beef and shrimp flavored ramen.

2021-06-25 20:41:56,wallstreetbets,Literally the only place that’d be kind of true is if they’re in the hot zones of California where a 100k home elsewhere is 1.5M. Regardless yoloing the full value of a PhD is just dumb.
2021-06-26 15:35:43,wallstreetbets,300k without a job...
2021-06-25 20:35:48,wallstreetbets,That is funniest thing

2021-06-25 23:04:32,wallstreetbets,Student loans my dude. You don't have to pay them back until your out. So you make it big and drop out. Or get your PhD and flip burgers.
2021-06-26 13:37:01,wallstreetbets,Cause he’s full of shit? 🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-06-25 20:19:37,wallstreetbets,Having $300k doesn't mean he worked for a year and a half.
2021-06-25 20:49:36,wallstreetbets,And economist who does not know the value of money. Sounds funny tbh
2021-06-25 20:50:38,wallstreetbets,Cmon man she clearly left because they were starving.

2021-06-26 07:33:55,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they've already come to an agreement. Not all divorces are drawn out legal fights. Courts prefer the couple to come to an agreement without having to go to trial. Probably something like 90% are pre-made agreements in principal of so and so get XYZ, the other spouse gets ABC and then the judge just confirms that both parties understand the agreement before the judge signs off on it."

They currently operate in only 8 states, and plan to double their footprint in the next year. The market is huge, and they currently have a tiny sliver of it.

Laugh now, but check back in 5 years and we’ll compare notes."

2021-06-26 11:19:53,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, that’s why farms should be exempted from inheritance tax, we make nothing - literally negative numbers some years - pay property taxes, then unless pops is educated and slick enough to get a lawyer to tell him how not to transfer with no taxes like a wall street guy, we get fucked at inheritance time for the next generation if you can keep it."

2021-06-26 01:23:21,wallstreetbets,"So, if you buy enough bonds such that your return is enough to pay your property tax, firstly that's a huge amount of bonds depending on the cost of your house and the property tax rate. You have to have that cash, and then you have to lose access to it until the bond matures. So sure, you could give up access to a large amount of cash essentially permanently to invest and use the interest to pay off the tax, but yeah, seems to be an extreme additional cost to property."

Doing a rough calculation of $12/hour x 160 hours per month x .8 (to account for a 20% tax rate) I estimate that their take home would be about $1,536. I could live on that (and have) in my area (like with a 20 min commute) but for it to work I would need to rent a room for ~$4-500. Not impossible but it would be hard to find. I imagine these folks have to have lots of roommates. However, when I lived off this income, I had no safety net really, so I would have been fucked if an unexpected expense came up.

There’s no way someone could live off that income in the Bay Area though, unless they could live rent free somehow."

I'll have $10 mil in 40 years easily, based on salary alone and not accounting for investments. Whatever your bar is for ""rich as fuck"" is again, very low. You can take your index fund strategy and sit on 10% gains per year and be happy, whatever floats your boat. Only case where OP loses $300k is if CLOV goes to $0."

If you are able to easily save more than 250k per year without investing any of it then congrats, you’re clearly better off than 99% of people and you are certainly not ‘starving’ like OP claims to be, and you should have better things to do than sitting on Reddit telling people what the word rich really means

And no, I don’t just sit on index funds because I want higher returns. That doesn’t mean I’m gonna throw a hissy fit and put my entire net worth into risky option plays just to show people on a subreddit while claiming to be starving."

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Nokia is #1 company to benefit from 5G Nokia was completely out of favor by Wall Street and that’s one of the things that has me so excited. Now that Wall Street recognized Nokia as #1 company to benefit from 5G, the stock will have an exponential growth. 

Remember we’re still in the early stages of a decade-long 5G boom, which we’re on track to take off this summer and begin to see 5G services offered. It is predicted that shipments for 5G devices in 2021 will exceed 500 million. And that’s when 5G will start to get really exciting and 5G networks will be live in hundreds of cities around the world. We’ll see applications like the Internet of Things… robotic surgery… holographic telepresence… and self-driving cars. All of these technologies need 5G and Nokia is the only company with an end-to-end 5G platform."

Think ""internet of things"" but not as smart fridges or smart toasters as touted here in this thread but rather operation oversight/efficiency monitoring/remote access/self-monitoring automation etc. If you think strong enterprises aren't looking to continuously upgrade their networks for more security and reliability you are wrong. If you think NOK will not grow their market share in this sector, I disagree but I can't say you're wrong about the future yet."
2021-06-26 11:44:26,wallstreetbets,"5G isn't already done. You may only be looking at the general consumer angle, in my opinion the real gains are in the corporate contracts, manufacturing, government, remote sites, and security aspects. 5G is huge for remote monitoring of operations and security for business and government. 5G isn't really going to take off because a memelord can view memes quicker, professionals are going to utilize private networks to take advantage of remote access and monitoring. 5G will also drive the IoT industry, but more specifically on the commercial and industrial end of IoT."

Also! Also they have instructive/educational videos on their website that will teach you what options Greeks and trading styles from beginner to advanced tutorials! There is no reason **NOT** to be as educated as possible before diving into the stock market. Good luck!

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Story of Ole' Grandape Foley and my YOLO into PSFE.  ***Gather round the campfire kiddo's - let me tell you about Good Ole' Grandape Foley.***

Many know the merits of Grandape Foley, but lots of you young monkey-like, natural resource handed savages may not. So let me paint the picture for you.

You think you have hands of Diamond? Well let me tell you.. Grandape Foley has diamond hands of the highest kind. Carats so large he doesn't only drag his knuckles, his forearms scrape the floor too. Here are some fun facts about Grandape Foley that will explain the legend behind the Ape.

&#x200B;

* He's 76 years old and still kicking wall street bankers in the dick. He does things his own way and builds empires with his glorious diamond hands mostly from scratch. I'll touch on that below.  
 
* He was born **4** months and **16** days before Hitler died. 4 days short of a 420. Coincidence? I think not.  
 
* As a young ape he lived in Texas, papa and mama ape Foley were ranchers (simple folks trying to make a living). He didn't have a silver spoon in his mouth and he built everything he has from scratch. He played something called [Shinny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinny) which is like informal Ice Hockey. He used a fuckin' broomstick on thin ice to play hockey. Everyone should hail Grandape Foley for his large balls and come up from nothing.  
 
* In 1967, while still in school...He made $40,000 in the stock market in his spare time. ***In 1960 fucking 7***. That's the equivalent of $322,000 today. He made the equivalent of more than a quarter of a million (in his spare time) before your daddy and mommy were out of grade school. Did I mention he wound up losing it all. Sounds like ***one of us.*** *(One of us! One of us!)*  
 
* He went to the Air Force and left after getting bored of negotiating multi-million dollar defense deals with Boeing. Grandape Foley had other goals in mind. So, he took his diamond hands and diamond balls and got into business...  
 
* Foley got involved with Fidelity National. Back when they were *only* doing $6m a year in revenue and grew the fuckin' thing to a current **$90B** market cap. Let that sink it. Diamond hands if I've ever seen any.  
 

**Grandape Foley is building his legacy, from scratch, everything he touches turns to gold with those glorious diamond hands. Fast-forward a bit and here's what he does next:**

&#x200B;

* Remember when I told you he played Shinny (informal ice hockey w/ a fucking broomstick). Well he developed a lifelong passion for Ice Hockey. So what does a rich, self-made ape do with his money and passion for Ice Hockey? Well, he buys an NHL team of course.But this isn't just any old regular ape schmo we're talkin' about here. This is Grandape Foley. He doesn't just buy the best team in hockey and take over the league. That would be too easy. Nope, he ***starts a new team, from scratch.***  
 
* In 2017 Grandape Foley brings the Las Vegas Golden Knights into the NHL and in their 2nd year they're already in the finals for the Stanley Cup. They didn't win, but that's likely because Foley wasn't on the ice with his broomstick.  
 

***And now the most important part in the legend of Grandape Foley.***

All the while, he's been building an almost silent iGaming Empire. And if there is anything we can learn from all of this, it's that Grandape Foley ***is a winner!***

He took PaySafe (PSFE) public around 6 months ago to not much fan fare. But Grandape Foley doesn't give a fuck. He's been silently moving his big balls all-through the iGaming industry making large strategic moves.

Grandape Foley once said it was hard to handle poker chips in his hometown of Vegas because they fall out of his diamond hands. So he's envisioning an entirely chipless casino industry, in person and legally online. While everyone is focusing on digital coins and old outdated movie companies getting eaten alive by Netflix. Foley is building a new world in iGaming and doing it on the back of PSFE.

Here's some more DD on Grandape Foley incase you haven't heard:

&#x200B;

* [He invested $100M in a 'strategic' move in sightline payments.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWoEz9BeqGQ) Which is bringing cashless payments to casinos. Strategic typically means, 'we intend on acquiring you'.  
 
* [he is bringing Wynn Casinos public.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/05/11/wynn-resorts-online-gambling-platform-is-going-pub/) Synergy baby! not to mention the ticker symbol... AUS, autists... he's speaking to us.  
 
* PSFE is currently landing deal after deal with iGaming providers to be their payments platform.  
 

This is a huge industry almost none of the big providers are touching because of the legal red-tape on iGaming and supporting their payment flow. So quietly, Grandape Foley is building an empire through PSFE.

A couple of thought provoking questions to think on in your Monkey brains:

&#x200B;

1. Isn't it obvious what's going on here? Foley is using the underlying payments platform PSFE to leverage his relationships in Vegas to completely dominate the iGaming industry.  
 
2. Good ole' Grandape owns an NHL team in Vegas. You better believe these Casino CEOs are coming to his owners box and talking business deals.  
 
3. Strategically investing in Sightline (cashless casinos tech) and Wynn (a large casino in and around Vegas)... hmmm...  
 

**Finally and most importantly what caused me to YOLO hard into PSFE**

From one Diamond handed ape to another, ask yourself... Why would Foley who is 76 years old, has all the money in the world and owns a major winning sports franchise waste his time messing around with PSFE and all the strategic plays if he didn't think this was going to be his biggest deal yet, and maybe ***his life legacy?***

I believe it will be. I believe he knows exactly what he's doing. You don't go from playing 'Shinny' with a broomstick on thin ice and milking cows to becoming a multi-self-made-billionaire if you don't know what you're doing.

I'm betting on good ole' Grandape Foley.

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PUBM NOW HAS LISTED OPTIONS!!!! Pubmatic just listed options today. This stock is in the hot Ad Tech  space. Similar to the Trade Desk TTD. They have a very high short interest 43% with a low float of 8.3 mm shares. Recent IPO end of last year. It got crushed anticipating lockup expiry. The IPO lockup expiry happened two weeks ago and was absorbed nicely. Volume has been increasing nicely as the stock has risen off bottom range and is now breaking out above key support levels. 
The recent Googl news that lifted other ad tech cos like TTD also helped lift the stock recently. Options were listed TODAY which should garner more interest in the name and could potentially provide more fuel for a gamma squeeze. I suspect other strikes will be added in coming days as it continues to go up. This is a great opportunity to buy into a company in a growing field with great potential. The dynamics of low float, high short interest, high borrow cost and limited stock borrow availability make this a good candidate for further moves higher. Plus options!!!!!   I bought TTD at the ipo and sold when it doubled...way too soon.PUBM In my opinion has the same growth trajectory!!! Not financial advice. I am long and simply love this setup for future gains.

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SPR due diligence (disclaimer: this is my $14M play) Figured it's time to write some brief words on my YOLO and why I think we need to be extremely bullish at current price levels (see: [$14MM YOLO post](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4bfal/made_14mm_in_1_year_finally_hit_14_million_friday/)).

TL;DR -- If Spirit AeroSystems’ revenue simply grows at conservative consensus estimates, then SPR has 60-70% upside ($80+ implied share value). It has short interest of 5.25% with 2.9 days to cover.

Spirit Aerosystems, not to be confused with Spirit Airlines, is the world's largest first-tier aero structures manufacturer. Most notably, they were spun off from Boeing 15 years ago and now make parts for several Boeing jets. Their largest revenue generator is from the 737 Max and 787. Though they also make shipsets for Airbus jets and for military purposes.

Currently, SPR trades at $49, a price which implies that SPR will never recover from the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic it was trading at $69 and prior to the 737 Max issues it was trading at a high of $101. I believe SPR will trade upwards of $80+ this year, especially when [China recertifies the 737 Max](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-15/u-s-talking-to-china-on-boeing-737-max-approval-raimondo-says), which they will need to do, as their current suppliers cannot possibly build enough jets to meet the travel demand in China this year and into the future.

Supporting catalysts:

* It's rumored that **United will announce a 100+ 737 Max purchase on Tuesday**.  With safety agencies in the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Australia, the U.K. and the E.U. allowing the return of the 737 MAX, orders for the aircraft are picking up again. This year, [United Airlines](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/03/01/united-airlines-orders-boeing-737-max-planes-post-covid-travel/6877944002/), [Southwest Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/southwest-airlines-adds-100-orders-for-boeing-737-max-jet.html), and [Ryanair](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-737max-ryanair/ryanair-buys-75-boeing-max-jets-in-largest-order-since-grounding-idUSKBN28D27O) have placed a combined 200 (6% of Boeing’s current 737 backlog) orders for the Boeing 737 MAX. For reference, Spirit AeroSystems made just 71 B737 deliveries in 2020. 
* Travel demand and [TSA travel numbers](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput) are increasing sharply
* [China recertification will happen this year](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-15/u-s-talking-to-china-on-boeing-737-max-approval-raimondo-says) at some point, opening up Boeing to deliver on 25% of its order book
* 737 Max will help lead the recovery, as narrow body planes are the largest segment of the market and make up 60% of the global fleet (Boeing estimates that airlines will need 32,270 narrow body aircraft over the next 2 decades)
* As seen with Southwest Airlines, switching airplane costs are sky high and therefore customers will stick with Boeing, who will stick with Spirit
* Spirit AeroSystems has $925 million remaining for future repurchases under its current authorization. Once the firm recovers from the disruption to its business, shareholders should expect repurchases buybacks to resume
* The recent recovery in oil prices also pressures airlines to upgrade aging fleets with new and more efficient aircraft. Should oil prices persist at elevated levels, then airlines could be motivated to increase orders, which could quickly improve both Spirit AeroSystems’ profits and share price
* The firm can manage its operations for 42 months before needing additional capital

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$VIAC $BIDU $JD - Billy Hwang's Guh Might Have Found A Bottom I'm sure most of you remember [this past March when Bill Hwang lost $20 Billion days](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/luxury/article/3134631/bill-hwang-wall-street-investor-who-lost-us20-billion-days) \- the ultimate degenerate. Well, during his (many) margin calls he liquidated a few stocks that are now fundamentally undervalued - and have great technical setups. 

The best looking ones right now are $VIAC, $JD, $BIDU. Not only that - but they all are breaking key reversal patterns as we speak.

**$VIAC**

[$VIAC 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/9kxri3jazf771.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=9deb3c36f38a5b8f4056068ba96480fa0afdfdad)

This one is an ascending triangle coming from downside - which can be an important reversal pattern. It breaks up today above **43.75** targeting **48.54** and above that as far as **60.71.** The timeframe for a setup like this is **2 weeks - 1 month.**

**Position Idea** \- August 50c

**$BIDU**

[$BIDU 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/84o2pkhlzf771.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=57099ef9163a66b3df62086556da312d91754904)

Here we have a symmetrical triangle. Normally this would have a bearish bias - but it can honestly be played either way. In this case we are breaking to the upside so long as we hold today's close above **199.50.** From here it would target **228.88 --> 244.79.** Again -  timeframe for a setup like this is **2 weeks 1 month.**

**Position Idea** \- August 230c

**$JD**

[$JD 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/skmvc9ol0g771.png?width=2224&format=png&auto=webp&s=df78ebd187e70158e1dc172237913fc184eb50ac)

This is an inverse head and shoulders - a major reversal pattern. In my opinion - this setup looks the best. Was seeing a ton of dark pool buying as well - also increased volume today. Needs **78.00** on today's close to enter. Targets **88.00.** Timeframe **2 weeks - 1 month.**

**Position Idea** \- August 90c

It's about time these names reversed - and longs have seen so much pain no one talks about them anymore. Tells me they are ready to *rip*.

New York, June 23, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service, (""Moody's"") upgraded Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.'s (Cliffs) Corporate Family Rating (CFR) to Ba3 from B1, its Probability of Default Rating (PDR) to Ba3-PD from B1-PD, its guaranteed senior secured note rating to Ba2 from B1, its guaranteed senior unsecured note rating to Ba3 from B2 and its senior unsecured note rating to B2 from B3. The company's Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating was upgraded to SGL-1 from SGL-2. Its ratings outlook remains positive.

""The upgrade of Cleveland-Cliffs ratings reflects the materially improved steel sector fundamentals, which will support a robust near term operating performance and solid free cash flow generation and lead to a sizeable debt pay down and a strengthening of its liquidity profile and sustainably stronger credit metrics."" said Michael Corelli, Moody's Senior Vice President and lead analyst for Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.

Ratings Upgraded:

..Issuer: Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.

.... Corporate Family Rating, Upgraded to Ba3 from B1

.... Probability of Default Rating, Upgraded to Ba3-PD from B1-PD

.... Speculative Grade Liquidity Rating, Upgraded to SGL-1 from SGL-2

....Senior Unsecured Regular Bond/Debenture, Upgraded to B2 (LGD5) from B3 (LGD5)

Outlook Actions:

..Issuer: Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.

....Outlook, Remains Positive

RATINGS RATIONALE

Cliffs' Ba3 corporate family rating incorporates its inconsistent historical operating performance and free cash flow generation due to its exposure to cyclical end markets and volatile iron ore and steel prices, but also considers our expectation for a **significantly improved operating performance and substantial debt reduction in 2021 that will result in near term metrics that are strong** for the rating. The rating also presumes the company will maintain moderate financial leverage and ample interest coverage in a normalized steel price environment when supply and demand come back into balance.

Cliffs rating also considers the company's large scale and strong market position as the largest US flat-rolled integrated steel producer in the US with flat-rolled steel production capacity of about 16.5 million tons, and the benefits of its position as an integrated steel producer from necessary raw materials through the steel making and finishing processes. Cliffs has a strong position in the North American iron ore markets, and the start-up of its new HBI facility enables it to provide raw materials to growing domestic EAF producers given the freight cost savings relative to imported pig iron and also the option to sell this product to its own mills. Cliffs rating also reflects the benefits of its contract position, particularly with the automotive industry, which provides a good earnings base. Its performance won't benefit as much from a high steel price environment and the benefits will lag the rise in pricing due to the nature of the contracts and renegotiation periods, but this does provide downside mitigants in a falling steel price environment.

Cliffs evidenced a weak operating performance in 2020 given the impact of automotive production shutdowns on the acquired AK Steel business and generally weak economic activity due to the impact of the coronavirus which resulted in weak steel demand and prices. However, **its operating performance will materially strengthen in 2021 due to a quicker than anticipated recovery in steel demand, along with the addition of ArcelorMittal's assets and the recent surge in steel and iron ore prices. Cliffs expects to produce about $5 billion in adjusted EBITDA assuming hot rolled coil prices (HRC) average about $1,175 per ton during the remainder of 2021**. ***This assumption could be conservative considering HRC prices are at a record high of about $1,700 per ton in June 2021*** after declining to a 4.5-year low around $440 per ton in July 2020 due to the effects of the pandemic. The price surge has been attributable to industry consolidation, a temporary dislocation of supply and demand, low steel inventories and rising iron ore and scrap prices. Cliffs will also benefit from historically high iron ore prices which have surged to more than $200 per ton from below $100 per ton a year ago (62% Fe fines, cfr Iron ore from Qingdao).

...Steel prices are likely to remain elevated for the remainder of 2021 with industry consolidation improving competitive dynamics and capacity reductions and maintenance outages tightening supply. Even if steel prices return to a more normalized historical level, Cliffs will be able to materially reduce its outstanding debt and strengthen its liquidity position this year.

...If it only pays off its revolver borrowings and no other debt in 2H21 this will reduce its adjusted leverage ratio (debt/EBITDA) to around 1.0x and raise its interest coverage (EBIT/Interest) to about 10.0x...

Cliffs' Speculative Grade Liquidity rating of SGL-1 reflects the company's very good liquidity profile, which is supported by an upsized $3.5 billion asset-based lending facility (ABL) and our expectation for strong free cash flow this year...

The two notch upgrade of the senior secured guaranteed notes (Ba2) and the senior unsecured guaranteed notes (Ba3) reflects the expected pay down of the revolver borrowings as well as the company's sizeable unsecured debt and underfunded pension liabilities which provide an uplift. The B2 rating on the senior unsecured notes reflects their junior position in the capital structure.

The positive ratings outlook incorporates our expectation for a significantly improved operating performance in 2021 that will result in credit metrics that are strong for the company's rating. It also reflects the possibility of further ratings upgrades if the company continues to use its free cash to pay down debt as it becomes callable in 2022.

FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS

Cliffs ratings could be considered for an upgrade if steel prices and metal spreads remain above historical averages and the company demonstrates a clearly defined and more conservative financial policy and pursues further debt reduction. Quantitatively, if Cliffs sustains a leverage ratio of no more than 3.0x and CFO less dividends in excess of 30% of its outstanding debt through varying steel price points, then its ratings could be positively impacted.

Cliffs ratings could be downgraded should leverage be sustained above 4.0x or CFO less dividends below 20% of its outstanding debt or it fails to maintain a good liquidity profile.

Headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. is the largest iron ore and flat-rolled steel producer in North America with approximately 21.2 million equity tons of annual iron ore capacity and about 16.5 million tons of flat rolled steel capacity. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 Cliffs had revenues of $9.0 billion."

2021-06-26 12:36:12,wallstreetbets,How would being smart with your money be a bad thing? I’m talking investing in good stocks with a solid foundation. Take Pinterest for example. I’ve been following it for a while and bought in @58. The app isn’t going anywhere and has now been steadily climbing since then and it’s almost @80 and will probably climb higher. Had this guy put in his 100k into a stock like that he would have profited 37k in 2months. It’s not the 2k a day I’m talking about but it’s still a safe bet.

2021-06-26 06:12:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, exactly, this proves my point. He's talking about value investing, which is buying undervalued stocks, and waiting for them to rise over the long term. He's saying you need to look at the company financials and work out your own price and then compare that to the ticker price to find out if something is overvalued or undervalued.

Edit. Holy shit, you think he's saying ""price is meaningless, don't worry about it."" That's what you thought he said isn't it. Jesus fucking wept son, I've seen some retards on this forum, but you really stole all the extra chromosomes didn't you!"

2021-06-26 07:40:40,wallstreetbets,"The share price isn’t a direct reflection of the company. You idiot. Lol.   
  
“Get fucked VG is worth $55 a share “ - evaluate the company, see if $55 is a fair value. If it is then look to invest or not. No one cares if you do or don’t, but don’t go around spewing nonsense because you have a personal vendetta against a company.   
It is literally a new company in a brand new field doing something no other company has done before and you think you know how to evaluate it before it has become operational??  
  
Lol!!
  
Buffet merely states he would ignore the share price initially and come up with his own evaluation, then look at the share price afterwards to see if it is over or under valued.   
  
Just because you personally don’t see value in SPCE or see the $55 share price as high, doesn’t mean everyone else does or should.   
  
If so, the 200 million transactions that occurred today are by people who have no idea what they’re doing.  
  

If you know exactly what companies are worth then you are Warren Buffett and you should be making billions by now.   
   
Then fact you are here whining about a company that owes you nothing probably means you aren’t."
2021-06-26 07:30:14,wallstreetbets,"Errrr….what?  
  
That’s what you got out of that?   
  
You either buy it because you think its worth what you paid for it and has value and want to use it or you buy it to sell to someone else down the road for hopefully more that you paid for it.   
  
The “down the road” is different for different people.   
  
Some might say I’ll buy now for $55 and flip it the next day for $56.   
Others might say I’ll buy now for $55 but in 30 years time it might go up in value to $500 and I’ll pass it to my kids.   
  
A bubble is only present if everyone is trying to do the quick turnaround. But you, as in individual, don’t know what the 200 million shares transactions that occurred today incentives are. If you think you do, again, you’re doing it wrong. 
  
Not everyone has the same incentive.   
  
If you don’t like what the game is like, why are you here?  
  
You either buy the stock because you think it’ll go up eventually and can sell it for a profit to someone else.  If you think it isn’t going to go up in value or you can’t sell it to someone else eventually, you are literally wasting your time and should go do something else"

2021-06-26 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TLRY I have posted the last two days about $TLRY and I wanted to update you all. Next week on Tuesday the full House appropriations committee takes up legislation for Fiscal 2022 policies to fund various federal agencies. 

“ A House subcommittee on Thursday approved a large-scale funding bill that includes provisions protecting banks from being punished for working with marijuana businesses and allowing Washington, D.C. to legalize cannabis sales.” 

“Both measures are attached to a bill to fund various federal agencies for Fiscal Year 2022 that was approved by the House Appropriations Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) Subcommittee in a voice vote. The full House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to take up the legislation on Tuesday.“

CNBC, MSNBC are not talking about this and it is a huge deal! That means businesses would be able to take loans and etc… from banks without penalty to the banks! That will be huge for growth in the cannabis industry. I bet you they start “PRing” this next week. There is a reason they were silent about the subcommittee approving the spending bill yesterday. To allow market makers time to accumulate shares. 

Allowing cannabis sales in DC is a HUGE step towards federal legalization! There is too many upcoming catalysts to ignore and with $TLRY being the largest marijuana company, I believe they serve the best chance to succeed! 

I am not a financial advisor and I do not recommend buying or selling any stock. This is my personal opinion and I hope this has already benefited some of you! I will continue to update as necessary! #ApesStrongTogether

2021-06-26 00:41:56,wallstreetbets,Isn't respect part of plur?
2021-06-26 08:21:43,wallstreetbets,"I manufacture like LZB, you’re really rolling the dice. Im very rich on paper right now, but that’s sold orders not produced product. There is a foam shortage with no end in sight. If the foam pourers can’t ramp up, it’s all spreadsheet theoretical money and will never turn into real money"
2021-06-26 06:53:47,wallstreetbets,"LZB has some really cheap jul 16 calls that are only like $.33  a share, so say you buy a a call for .33x100 ($33). If the premium appreciates to 1.33 on Monday at open you can just take your $100 and be off with it. And at sub $1 premiums even smaller portfolios can manage the risk. If you’re a degenerate I could see how this looks attractive. The premiums jumped up like crazy on Friday so who knows, another good day or two in a row and these calls could net some serious gains weeks before expiry."
2021-06-26 10:01:59,wallstreetbets,"It’s more so that the calls were cheap, and I wanted to take a gamble that has high risk/high reward. IMO, it’s a sort of truism, in the market, that most reactions are overreactions (see the recent drop in price). This is also what OP is saying more or less. These calls are going to be profitable if that holds true and we see a correction to the price."
2021-06-26 00:18:42,wallstreetbets,"I’m viewing from the perspective of demographics and the fact that others in the industry are all reporting strong numbers with strong projections into the next year. Take RH or William Sanoma for example. Truth is LZB earnings absolutely crushed it but a few large sells based on a brief part of the earnings call (re: supply chain potentially being an issue) and lingering fears about inflation pushed shares way into oversold territory. It’s kind of crazy in my opinion, considering they stated the next quarter is showing no signs of slowing down and the lowest analyst call is at 48 with the average at 50. All 4 analysts that cover the stock have reiterated their price targets and buy ratings. I honestly can’t say what the future will bring but this is a pretty staple name in an industry that is showing no signs of slowing down. I don’t think people will stop furnishing their homes because the pandemic ends nor do I really buy that working from home is the sole reasoning for the increase in sales. My thesis is a new, very large, generation is finally at a stage in life where they can afford to buy furniture and upgrade etc. Just a theory— best we can do is look at the numbers when trying to make a decision and from everything I see, LZB is undervalued by a good amount, especially after their recent performance. That spells profit in my eyes."
2021-06-26 00:32:36,wallstreetbets,"Sorry for the long ass response lol. To be more direct, I’m probably going to close my calls when we get near 50 (depending on volume and timing), if this thing breaksout i’ll let it ride but regardless, i will most likely move into a long position and just buy and hold my shares for at least one year. I think we’ll be significantly higher than 50 by then and being able to roll my profits into the long term capital gains tax rate would be sick. This is all assuming the next few quarters look good. I expect margins might be slightly lower next quarter like they said on the call but as long as everything looks ok, I’m staying put. This company has a strong ass balance sheet and will most likely announce the dividend in the next month or two (which has been going strong for like 9 years) so I think there is plenty of upside. Who knows tho, i might be living under a bridge in a year."
2021-06-26 08:58:22,wallstreetbets,He sure did.  I tried telling him that wasn't good enough. He needs hookers and cocaine.
2021-06-26 00:22:20,wallstreetbets,"Great thoughts, thanks for taking the time to write them out! I'm gonna look more into some longer calls through the fall, this would be massive if we get anywhere close to $50"
2021-06-26 08:28:21,wallstreetbets,"You’re right about everything, except there’s no foam buddy. I manufacture like LZB and on paper my company has x4. You can Google why there’s no foam, it’s about 5 reasons. Factor in hurricane season coming up (increases plywood costs), but hey maybe I’m so close to the situation that I’m not seeing it right"
2021-06-26 01:24:41,wallstreetbets,"Better hedge your position and buy a recliner for living under that bridge lol. Good luck, I think I'm probably gonna stay in this a little longer than I initially planned. Gambling on La-Z-Boy lol what the fuck has my life come to... 🍻"
2021-06-26 01:30:28,wallstreetbets,How much did you invest into the calls for them to be up 33k?
2021-06-26 10:38:02,wallstreetbets,"thanks for mentioning that. I haven't looked into foam specifically but will definitely check it out. From my brief, (5 minute) research-- is it accurate to say it was primarily because of the texas freeze and the shut down of 3-4 plants that produce propylene oxide (which is needed to create foam)? Do ya'll primarily get your foam domestically or does it come from overseas? Thanks in advance, always appreciate learning something from someone on the ground."
2021-06-26 01:28:30,wallstreetbets,lmao well said 🍻
2021-06-26 04:45:02,wallstreetbets,Cost basis was around 64k but I’ve added an addition 26k or so yesterday. Why the fuck am i still awake
2021-06-26 00:39:19,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm, was high. Gonna leave it"
2021-06-26 16:57:34,wallstreetbets,"Foam is generally too large to transport efficiently, and it doesn’t weigh much it’s like shipping air so yeah most of it is domestic. It was due to those things as well as labor shortage, they didn’t see the increase in sales coming, and they’re greedy all the big boys got slapped with price rigging class action suits 6 years ago"
2021-06-26 17:02:16,wallstreetbets,"Labor shortage because those specific workers are around the $15 an hour, lot of them got laid off during the panic, hard to get them back when the government is paying very well to not work still"

2021-06-25 21:06:40,wallstreetbets,"I still feel like self-driving would be most beneficial if all the vehicles on the road were self-driving. Because if youre car is doing the speed limit, but shit for brains next to you is doing a thousand miles per hour on the shoulder and loses control, I mean, I dunno. If the cars were all communicating with each other it would be alot safer Im sure. Flawless intersections etc.

Though Im old school. I like having a steering wheel to execute tiny micro-corrections while on ice/snow etc. Something about hoping that my computer doesnt malfunction while in a truck that weighs a few tons just doesnt sit easy with me. Im not sure that it ever will honestly. Once my generation dies off itll probably be alot more popular."

This was on the tail end of Canoo announcing it's plans to build a 'mega-microfactory' in Perry, Oklahoma which was orginally meant to be the planned location for Tesla's Gigafactory that went to Austin, Texas. With a connection in construction, I can confirm that bidding/planning for the Canoo factory is in full swing.

2021-06-26 00:03:57,wallstreetbets,"Can someone explain to a noob what the $9.78 current price and 0.67 avg cost mean in the screenshot with respect to buying the calls? OP bought 7 contracts and paid a premium of $0.67 per share (so 700*.67 = $469)? And because the Nike share price went up to $154 now his calls are paying a premium of $9.78 per share? 

What determines how it’s worth $9.78 per share now. Just because that’s the amount over the OPs call strike price? why would someone pay a premium to buy OPs $145 call now if it’s already in the money and the buyer would need to pay a premium just to get it. Does the buyer somehow still make a profit?"

2021-06-25 23:46:27,wallstreetbets,"i collect/resell sneakers, 95% of release on one of their quick strike apps sell out. They release anywhere between 40-60 quickstrike shoes a month, with stock numbers usually ranging from 50K-200K. Again this is only sneakers released from quick strike. 

Nike is up there as one of the strongest brand names worldwide. They appear in pop culture, there’s a huge sneaker head community, and they make very functional sports accessories."
2021-06-26 09:54:49,wallstreetbets,"Nah, with your luck the stock would have tanked after you bought in"
2021-06-26 04:22:50,wallstreetbets,"A single option contract is essentially leverage to 100 shares. So this isn't how it actually works but 10*100=1000 percent return. 

Like I said, not how it actually works. But that's how you can get a massive gain off of a small price movement"

2021-06-26 15:08:43,wallstreetbets,Traders were mispositioned. CNBC was saying to buy puts and a lot of people sold calls so perfect catalyst once Nike dropped good news

Simple supply and demand once you understand it - people FOMO if a stock is shooting up rapidly, so option prices skyrocket to meet the sudden demand etc"

2021-06-26 12:02:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah WKHS SI is off the charts.
2021-06-26 04:36:23,wallstreetbets,I scrolled through the comments and the OP hasn't said a single word to anyone. That's really sus to me. This post is very FUD'y and is obviously some sort of mistake on ortex's part.
2021-06-25 23:53:45,wallstreetbets,Yeah pretty sure it’s at 63% and I check Ortex today
2021-06-26 04:30:34,wallstreetbets,"Welp, looks like the fuckery has commenced and I'm about to lose some fucking money on calls again. Smfh. How is this possible? I've been telling everyone the SI is over 60% and when I looked at the chart, I saw no big movement that showed any type of big covering events happened. The only thing I can think of is maybe WKHS themselves are cutting some sort of deal with them and selling them shares without effecting the share price."
2021-06-25 23:55:30,wallstreetbets,Lol I set my sell price at $69 for WKHS…I hope the Market Makers enjoyed seeing that statistic 😆

2021-06-25 21:34:04,wallstreetbets,"100%.  The CEO is legit and has understated forward guidance to avoid a miss in the 2nd quarter of being a publicly traded company. I'm amazed at the high short interest the stock has amassed in the last few months. Sure that trading at 10x revenue is pricey but given the overall market pricing and the promising future the company has, 31% of the float shorted seems way too much. Depop has been bought at 20x revenue and is just a website, no assets, no moat, nothing.

Even though avg volume is 680k, most days the stock trades between the range of 150-250k shares. That's about 12-15 days to cover wich is fucking nuts. I wish this sub paid more attention to trading based on fundementals coupled with possible squeezes instead of simply looking at short interest and following the herd.

Another thing is that $IBUY, and actively managed ETF based on online retailers, had a 500% return in the last 5 years. ThredUP is now their highest holding, which tells you something.

Happy to see others following the stock, hope we get paid sooner than later!"
2021-06-25 20:07:25,wallstreetbets,"TDUP published a report this week, written by a third party but I believe paid for by TDUP, so take it with a grain of salt. It does have a lot of information on market research they have performed that supports their business mode. Obviously biased but some of it is compelling. Of course they need to make it through the skinny years now before they have any hope of profitability. Quite a high ceiling though IMO.

2021-06-25 21:23:00,wallstreetbets,"Full disclosure, I tried to play most every meme the last 3 weeks and came out ahead in all of them. Not a ton, but cash nonetheless and still in a couple. 

2 examples. $WOOF bought 100 sh PM the day it was going to run right away on Fidelity. It ran and sold a CC over it for a decent chunk near top. Sold very next day PM again. Left the CC that would never get exercised. Probably close to $1500. 

$WEN smaller side. Bought PM again cb $24.20. Thought hardly any downside risk. Sold CC for $32 at top for decent chunk and then rolled down twice for same DTE last Friday. Like $500 in premiums and net cb probably about $19 now and just sold a CC for $25 for 7/16. So still in that one and will let it ride unless gets called away. But cant lose on it. 

Folks have done much better and others worse. Just trying things out and trying to play with nearly no downside risk while having some decent upside potential. 

Everything is probabilities. Fucked up and have wanted to post this. That is all."

Troll alt came to wsb and memetron banned it. Reddit added an ip tracker and subsequently anytime any of the alt accounts went to wsb it was temp banned and then finally perma banned sitewide.

2021-06-26 15:29:12,wallstreetbets,It will. They just posted positive earnings. Buying calls as far out as you can might be a great move.

2021-06-26 16:54:51,wallstreetbets,"Curaleaf did $260MM USD in Q1.

Green Thumb and Trulieve were around $195MM in Q1 and Cresco was around $178MM. All 3 expect to be above $250MM/qtr by Q3-21 or Q4-21.

Check out r/WeedStocks and r/CannabisMSOs for more info 👍🏼

Sundial did like $8 million revenue last Q. Tilray did like $55ish IIRC"
2021-06-25 22:06:19,wallstreetbets,Which fund is this? I didn’t know there was a way to see who was short or long in anything.

2021-06-25 23:35:17,wallstreetbets,"yes they would be profitable

you would have to take into account deferred revenue and elons compensation program as well. 

but thats too much math and thinking for gay bears"
2021-06-26 03:28:46,wallstreetbets,me too. but lets be honest almost nothing in the infrastructure bill will go towards infrastructure or worthwhile use and green energy is mostly a leftist misnomer for nepotism and paybacks to big tech campaign donors. those subsidies are just going to be more of your middleclass tax dollars being funneled to solyndra type garbage as thanks for democrat party campaign contributions
2021-06-25 21:42:20,wallstreetbets,Oh I guess that means they won't sell a million cybertrucks then haha

It was either planned to break, or was a total guess of who knows what will happen - not exactly something you confidently go with as a demonstration.  They then even put out those silly rehearsal videos with the hammer and the door slightly ajar.  Cringey as shit."

2021-06-25 20:00:35,wallstreetbets,"Portnoy, if you happen to read this (and you've got enough of an ego that I think you will):  You say nobody that was in these trades had money and don't understand what it was like because you do.

&#x200B;

You're a gambler, right?  I've got a bet for you.  You, me, audited net worth.  I use PwC.  If you come within just five percent of what I have - just five measly percent -  I'll not only give you the 700 grand you ""lost"", but I'll buy enough shares in whatever you had to make you whole in the equity again.  And I'll make it a double or nothing bet for you, against 700k on your end.  I can have the contracts in a week.

2021-06-25 20:24:07,wallstreetbets,Dave’s a little bitch for running up SNDL with his hedges a few weeks later in Feb and selling at 4.20 in the pre market. Bipolar fuck.

2021-06-25 22:32:19,wallstreetbets,I gotta be honest I’ve only partially paid attention to wsb and the whole meme stock thing but having a fox business host call a guy a little butch in your guys’ name is pretty fucking cool.
2021-06-25 22:35:32,wallstreetbets,"""Well HAHA I live in a pretty big house I'm not worried about that "" 🤣🤣🤣 Payne is fucking triple OG !!!"
2021-06-25 22:46:09,wallstreetbets,"Portnoy is such an elitist. Love Charles for pressing him. Dave should clear the hundred dollar bills from his ears so he can realize the point Charles was making: some people only had 5¢ to invest and lost it all, Dave lost $700k and was still a multimillionaire."
2021-06-25 22:53:55,wallstreetbets,"I just witnessed a “bruh moment” when he asked “who is Gary Gensler” after talking smack about the people calling him paperhands, who probably know who Gensler is. SMFH. Even I know who he is. What a little bitch."

2021-06-26 18:46:17,wallstreetbets,Portnoy is rude and a paper hand bitch
2021-06-25 20:44:09,wallstreetbets,"Blah, just a game of candy points. The ending had me though, Portnoy is a moron who thinks he can do good because he used to bet on some sports plays. He's just a wannabe', his investing strategies and lack of understanding just show he belongs on his cell phone using Draft Kings while he's 8 Budweiser in and he waits for his hotdog at the tailgate. I mean he blatantly tried to redirect the whole time and wouldn't let up to be properly interviewed."
2021-06-25 20:03:21,wallstreetbets,this needs 2 be a tshirt
2021-06-25 20:04:18,wallstreetbets,David portnoy has the self awareness of a child. This was infuriating to watch.
2021-06-25 20:20:24,wallstreetbets,This is a dirty word here but did anyone see Portney try to trade crypt0? That was hilarious.

2021-06-25 21:46:24,wallstreetbets,I personally don’t care that he paper handed. That guy has done more for small businesses and business owners during the pandemic then the fuckin government. He might be a paper handed little bitch. But he’s alright in my book.

2021-06-26 02:24:34,wallstreetbets,"Lettuce.


Why?"
2021-06-26 17:50:57,wallstreetbets,"Hello Portnoy?

Your move...."
2021-06-25 21:34:19,wallstreetbets,"In all seriousness though, I don’t think he has to apologize to anyone. It’s his money, if he wants to sell, he can sell and doesn’t owe anybody anything. The only thing he has to apologize to is his wallet. But he doesn’t have to apologize to you, me, or anyone in Ape Nation."
2021-06-25 20:42:02,wallstreetbets,"Payne was wrong Ive been on this train for awhile and I had not a single clue that Portnoy was involved. There will only ever be one face of this movement and we all know who that is. 

Portnoy should stick to watching clips of frat bros pounding beer and paralyzing themselves."

2021-06-26 00:15:17,wallstreetbets,I still like both of them
2021-06-26 01:07:39,wallstreetbets,my favorite part is when payne acts like a little bitch and pathetically tries to humblebrag about the size of his house because he thought davey accused him of being a poor peasant
2021-06-26 11:45:15,wallstreetbets,What a pointless conversation. How old are these guys? 10? This is actually on television. Gross.
2021-06-26 13:08:21,wallstreetbets,"Why do y’all care?

Did it change anything about your holdings?"

2021-06-26 06:05:24,wallstreetbets,"How is it competitive? Or at least one of the most competitive?

Not doubting your statement by any means I’m just curious, who’s the competition? I can understand it being the hedge funds but would that be mainly referring shorts. 

I’m under a year in and just curious what you mean by what you said."
2021-06-25 21:21:16,wallstreetbets,"We live in the weirdest timeline.

I have never seen a person called a little bitch during an interview on a business channel"

2021-06-25 21:22:30,wallstreetbets,He’s the president of barstool
2021-06-25 21:37:34,wallstreetbets,His monologue he put out when all the brokers shut off trading GME was pretty good though

2021-06-26 01:13:09,wallstreetbets,"This may be a dumb question given your post history on this sub, but was the bulk of your fortune amassed from trading or your profession?

2021-06-25 20:29:10,wallstreetbets,Barring maybe this interview business channels seem to be the only informative news nowadays.
2021-06-26 00:05:49,wallstreetbets,"Channels make money by selling ad spaces. Price of the ad spaces depends on viewership. So there's incentive to maximize viewership, not to create authentic informational content. 

A provocative, misinformational news channel would be very profitable as it'll bring in viewers regardless of how they feel about it. An accurate but, for that same reason, boring news channel would have very low viewership and  would be naturally shut down or move to the former type to stay alive.

It is usually argued that if most of the revenue for the channel could be met by viewers by paying higher fees to access it, that would incentivize authentic reporting. But as someone who works in marketing, people don't necessarily want the truth, they usually want something that confirms their biases.

Iirc, the industry he was in gave him knowledge that helped him with it, but (while he was presumably decently paid) isn’t where his fortune came from. He rode the dotcom bubble all the way up, multiplying his money left right and centre, and then had his own Big Short moment and rode the bubble all the way down. With his resulting fortune and knowledge, he established his VC, which has probably only grown his piles of gold since.

He’s also held several thousand pieces of devil gold since the very early days of it"

A lot people on here with their ""retard"" masks on are actually experienced, professional traders using sentiment they generate here to help move stocks. Posting a huge ""yolo"" buy can move a stock a couple of dollars by encouraging a bunch of people to follow. Buy puts at the same time. Take profit by selling the underlying when the stock moves, grab more profit on the downside with the puts. Wait a week and do it again. Even if you only move the stock $1, that shit adds up when you have 1000s of shares. Micro Pump-n-Dumps.

BB just announced IVY advisory council and GEICO is going to be on board as a part of the team to accelerate IVY leadership in transportation. Geico has 24 million cars insured and 15 million customers. Analysts who downgraded BB after winning the Frost & Sullivan technology innovation award wants you to think that Amazon and Geico are wasting time partnering with BB. Do you think IVY is going to fail with AWS and Geico ,Here , and Telus all working together on one project. Allianz Asset Magement recently bought 27 million Blackberry shares. Do you think Allianz made a big mistake buying BB. Analysts who downgraded BB after beating revenues wants you to sell your shares.

Allianz Asset Magement recently bought 27 million shares of Blackberry. This vote of confidence by instituonal Investors confirms that Blackberry turnaround is complete. Institutional investors are buying in John Chen's turnaround strategy and trust in his ability to execute the plan. Blackberry turnaround story is turning into a growth story and together with Amazon Blackberry is revolutionizing the software defined smart car ecosystem. With GEICO on the team as a part of the IVY advisory council Blackberry is dancing with the giants and back on the world's stage as a leader in technology innovation. An icon is forever. Blackberry is an innovation icon. They invented the smart phone, instant messenger BBM was around and used by political figures and business leader well before WhatsApp. Blackberry smart phones were the first smart phone on the market well before the iPhone. Blackberry is making a phenomenal come back and the best is yet to come. Hold, be patient and like John Chen said "" Stay tuned"" . The pending settlement with Facebook over IP licensing fees turned into Patent sale and may be a partnership with Facebook is in the works. John Chen meant by saying stay tuned ...Good News is Coming, don't sell your shares. FB just launched WhatsApp stores and enterprise messenger with premium membership . This had Blackberry written all over it. Don't sell your shares. Hold. Amazon may acquire Blackberry in 2023 when John Chen retires after 10 years at BB. His turnaround strategy to save BB will be taught at Harvard Business School."
2021-06-26 10:58:52,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry share price today is irrelevant., It's unimportant. As long as the share value in 2023 is higher than what it is today , that's what 
matters. ...That's important. 
Blackberry Launched BB IVY advisory council in partnership with AWS  GEICO Telus, and Here . 

IVY roll out is around the corner. , Feb 2022. Blackberry made tremendous progress in the software defined smart car ecosystem. They are pioneering the transportation system innovation. Amazon may acquire BB in 2023 and it one John Chen time for retirement after being at Blackberry for 10 years and the turnaround time is over. He sold Sybase to SAP after staying at Sybase and  saving the company from bankruptcy. At Sybase John grew the co from 3.6 billion to 50 billion market cap and took the share price from 6 to 65 during his 10 years term. Hold . Be patient. John Chen said stay tuned when asked about the patent sale. He meant hold , don't sell . Good news is coming. The future is very bright for Blackberry. From smart phones to smart cars, Blackberry transition is a miracle, beyond phenomenal and the best is yet to come for Blackberry.

2021-06-26 15:03:09,wallstreetbets,"Today's share price is unimportant, it's irrelevant. Hold long term and you will be just fine.

In October this year there will be BB IVY preview. Numerous customer wins are already in place for IVY. Blackberry just invested in Electra Italian based auto software AI battery technology innovator and brought Electra to accelerate IVY. 
Be patient and hold. It doesn't matter how much you paid today. 17 , 20 , 28 who cares when the share value is much higher than it is today and fairly valued according to peers in the same sector. If Blackberry hits 100 in 2023 and Amazon aquires BB at 50% mark up who care what you paid today."

2021-06-26 15:08:34,wallstreetbets,So relax. Be patient and hold hold long term. Let the man do his job. John Chen had done an outstanding job so far and transitioned the company from hardware to software. And John and Andy Jassey are in one team making progress tremendous progress. You just sit back and relax. What more can you expect. Andy Jassey was the man behind AWS and John Chen is guinus. John had a reputation for turning around ailing tech companies that's only second to o Jobs when Steve fixed Apple.
2021-06-26 10:43:28,wallstreetbets,Hold. Blackberry is about to bounce back. IVY roll out is around the corner. Geico. Telus AWS after all team in the IVY advisory council. They hired 23% more sales force. Won big list of US Government contracts. Read the earnings transcript. It's very good. Hold

Otherwise WKHS should have hit $20 Friday.  Some BIG sells occurred right near the close keeping it at $15.60, I saw a couple in the 120,000 range and everyone who posts are either holding or buying dips and holding, something does not smell right.  However all they are really doing is making it harder for them to cover when the squeeze occurrs."
2021-06-26 15:53:34,wallstreetbets,"I have been in it and watching it daily for 6 months, it is  a growing infant that the Shorts have singled out to destroy.  I first bought at $15.15 and bought more on the way down, loaded up at $8.10 (when the short interest hit 26%) and continued buying on the way up.  Now the short interest is 60%+.  Insiders own less than 6%, institutional investors hold 43% of the stock.  Now I own more than most of the insiders and I am still buying.  I see a short squeeze like happened with  GME in the not too distant future.  I made over $3mil on TSLA stock and most of it is now in WKHS."
2021-06-26 15:55:20,wallstreetbets,"agree, and WKHS looks WAY better on paper!"
2021-06-26 15:57:31,wallstreetbets,"You are backed by the numbers, what I see as strange is there supposedly no more shares to lend out, yet they continue to short?  I think they are playing some games and WKHS short interest is at least 65% as of Friday's close."
2021-06-26 16:05:56,wallstreetbets,"I agree, what really bothers me is AMC and GME (the companies) are selling stock as fast as they can, so WSB's are helping them as much if not more, than they are fighting the Shorts.

They are making the Companies Rich.  WKHS is not selling shares and does not have the shares that AMC and GME have to sell.  So we are in a direct battle with the Shorts, we do not have to worry about WKHS (the company) flanking us.   WKHS is in much better position for a short squeeze, the Numbers look Too Good to be True and they keep getting better!"
2021-06-26 17:11:44,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-26 17:26:51,wallstreetbets,"Agree, the numbers look too good to be true!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have a ton and am still buying on the morning dips when the Shorts trash it.  WKHS follows the same trading pattern almost every day.  This is liking taking Candy from a Baby!

On research yesterday, IF you trade on Margin, your Broker can lend your shares to the Shorts.  If you are not on Margin, they still will lend them, however you can request that they do not lend them out and they should stop, IF they say they won't simply threaten to transfer to another brokerage and they will then comply.  I trade with a Margin account, but in around the 2nd week of August my largest stock will start hitting the 1 year long term capital gains requirement and If I sell it (which I intend to), I can buy out of my Margin account and request that my broker recall my WKHS shares (currently 222,000 and still buying).  This could be a BIG wake up call to the ?Shorts that have been sitting on my shares!"
2021-06-26 17:37:15,wallstreetbets,"That got a laugh out of me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   WKHS.

Women have cost me $$Millions.  First wife pulled a Jeckle and Hyde on me, dated for 3 years, 1 month after we got married she turned into Hyde!   current wife is Perfect, does not like to shop or spend $$, she works right beside me on any job I take on.  3 years ago we built a 730' long 6' high block wall around our property, 6500 Cinder blocks, 48 Pallets of 60 lb bags of concrete from Home Depot, mixed it all in a mixer.  She worked right beside me every day for over 2 months.  And on top of it she is cute, 5'3, 125#'s.  

Best of luck with yours!"
2021-06-26 17:16:46,wallstreetbets,"YES, and it is a huge separator that puts it ahead of the competition.  a couple of days ago they tested their drones for transporting Organs and Blood for Transports between Hospitals and from Airports to Hospitals. WKHS passed EVERY the tests with flying colors!"
2021-06-26 17:29:00,wallstreetbets,I want to se more posts like yours!  WKHS is on the launching pad!
2021-06-26 17:39:39,wallstreetbets,"much safer to just buy the stock and sit on  it, there is no time frame, but WKHS will go."

2021-06-26 18:52:51,wallstreetbets,"I have none.  I see this as a long term play with the price around $43 a year from now.  IF or when the short squeeze occurs, it all depends on when the ""Naked Short Selling "" stops.  I am actually hoping that they continue to short it and dig themselves into a 100' deep hole.  They have already entered the Illegal deceptive Short selling area, trying to drive the price down and make us sell.  This is why we all need to hold and buy of the dips they create daily.  the longer they sell, the deeper they dig their graves and the more we will make on the other end.  IF they bought back today, you might get $30, mid July $75, Mid August $130, September $300 and it goes on and on.  Bottom line they will eventually have to cover and the longer they take the more they will lose and the more you and I will make.  HOLD and buy the dips."

2021-06-25 23:53:58,wallstreetbets,Demand is definitely not low. The drop in stock price was because they said there could be a 20-30% hit to their profit margins thanks to the sky high raw material prices. The maximum possible hit has already been priced in. I expect a full rebound by mid-August just in time for the next earnings report and also the dividend they pay in early September.

2021-06-26 19:29:22,wallstreetbets,Know when to sell? Just don’t be greedy. Take the small wins and ignore the “paper hands” comments. People with money can afford to lose it. Be happy with 50-250$ gains until you figure out what you’re doing. I made the mistakes of waiting too long and passing up reasonable gains for what I put in.
