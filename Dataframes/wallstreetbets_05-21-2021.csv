2021-05-21 19:39:25,wallstreetbets,Do you think we are due for a pretty big SPY correction in the next year? I am thinking so just based on how much the slope has changed in the past five years or so.
2021-05-21 19:45:58,wallstreetbets,Really appreciate the work!! Bought some Monday 418c since the 415 supports hold through.. maybe I’m wrong but... who knows..

2021-05-21 19:02:51,wallstreetbets,"Opposite problem here, looking for it to break 418 next week 😂"

2021-05-21 19:16:25,wallstreetbets,I look for direction after 15 min of opening bell and I prefer to wait and buy Calls after a day or two of SPY closing in the red with exp. 2 weeks out. This takes timing but it seems to work for me

2021-05-21 16:36:33,wallstreetbets,LONG TERM yes but potential acquisition target for a quick gain. I am an Alteryx user with bascailly no coding skills. BEST PRODUCT OUT THERE
2021-05-21 16:17:26,wallstreetbets,Yes but you misspelled Athenex.
2021-05-21 16:24:05,wallstreetbets,"search for biotech smallcaps, especially those that citron washed down from 2016 starting. I do not disclose that list publicly. Do your DD there are several gems that are about to blow up in the coming 3 weeks."
2021-05-21 16:21:59,wallstreetbets,"I read there last earning. It's extremely promising long term. However, expect a slow growth with the market, it's not some crazy outlier. It's just a good, well used product, with crap lodes of people trained on it and will continue to use.

I took like 50% gains on last earnings gamble and then jumped back in days later. 

I'm currently averaging 10% down on some 5x leveraged stocks. 

I'm hoping to see 100%+ gains... Eventually... However I'm realistic to how the stock is moving too.

It's following tech, more specifically, Tesla.

If you've seen my comments Ive shorted Tesla before and might jump back in late next week depending on what the 8 ball says. 

This means I'm effectively hedging my own gains...

After the may event not really turning heads, and I've not read anything about it yet, I think it might rise but collapse with other stocks too. Growth stocks don't look good for a potential market crash next month. 

If I were you. No. Definitely not all in. 

So there we go... From someone bag holding already. Hoping to average down. Knowing I can buy lower, but would regret leaving my entire position even if I believe it's going down further...

Not very wall Street bets of me. But I ain't super bullish on it at the moment."
2021-05-21 16:44:53,wallstreetbets,"I doubled down yesterday. 

I see them as a tech COVID recovery play. They also have the best margins in the business. If/when growth picks up again they will skyrocket. I also think valuation is more than reasonable now - good risk/reward. 

Good luck!"
2021-05-21 19:10:32,wallstreetbets,Any good stocks to buy right now ?!
2021-05-21 18:04:28,wallstreetbets,"Not advice.

2021-05-21 17:52:19,wallstreetbets,"Problem is the last 2 years revenue shrank, meaning they’re not growing at all so the massive P/E isnt worth it. Most tech stocks apple,amzn,msft,pltr grow sales 20%+ a year for decades"

2021-05-21 16:27:43,wallstreetbets,"Duly noted. Maybe ill wait for a cross on the Weekly MACD then, before accumulating more longs."
2021-05-21 16:46:46,wallstreetbets,Another point for doubling down. Lets get some tendies sir.
2021-05-21 17:25:30,wallstreetbets,Markets about to crash. People will get burned on this lol. It isn’t a strong economy.

Jokes aside, great DD, yep seems like a solid investment, good upside and with a nice perspective not only for growth but for revenue. Will probably get a medium sized long position."
2021-05-21 17:08:59,wallstreetbets,"I plan on getting a position soon and building it out...very good DD and this is a really solid investment with the housing market where it is now, eventually more and more people will begin to sell their homes again post pandemic and begin to borrow money once again.

Next spike never came.

2021-05-21 19:34:17,wallstreetbets,"Noob question….how long must the minimum equity requirement of $25k remain in an account to satisfy the PDT rule and avoid 90 day PDT suspension?

For instance, say I deposit funds sufficient to push account balance over $25 k (at least 2 business days) before I PDT over the course of a few weeks. After those weeks are over, I cash out, bringing my balance back below $25k, but I no longer PDT after doing so. 

In that scenario, would I still be flagged as a PDT and would the account become frozen for 90 days as soon as I took my money out, leaving me unable to make non PDT trades with any remaining funds? Basically what I’m getting at, is that once I’m flagged as a PDT must I always keep the account above $25k from there on to avoid a penalty, or could I go back below $25k, provided I did not PDT’d after doing so?"

Raising wages at 10% Mcdonalds means your dollar McChicken would only cost 1.10 to pay people double.   

And that is assuming that paying people more doesn't result on greater effeciency by adding more employee loyalty and allowing Capex ROI calculations to justify more automation.

Instead we are refusing to pay people more and having things like chicken prices double because none of the supply lines can find enough labor to remain stable.  Product prices make up like 65% of McDonald's expenses.   We need to replace the SPY CEO for his piss poor management of the market."

2021-05-21 18:37:54,wallstreetbets,"**Components of a bet:**

**Bet Size:** How much money you are putting down up front.

**Duration:** When will this bet play out? For options, this is the time until your option expires.

**Payout Ratio:** If you win, this is how much you stand to gain divided by your bet size.

**Potential Loss:** For options, this is typically the same as your intial bet size.

**Probability of success:** How likely are you to ""win"" this bet? Backtesting can reveal potential empirical probabilities of your bet scenario playing out.

To find your bet size, plug your probability of success and payout ratio into the kelly criterion formula. This will optimize profit making."

Keep your losses a secret from family and friends, that way when you get a big win you can surprise them!  Money isn't real, so borrow as much as you need to break even.  Studies show that gambling is a great way to deal with loneliness and stress, stave away sadness, and even blow off steam. Drink alcohol. Get high."

2021-05-21 16:50:42,wallstreetbets,"How the stock market works

stock market is like a shop where like the limbs of a company is sold.  Now, the money you used to buy their limbs will be used by the company to fund other things for their own. U might wonder why some stocks are expensive. Well let's put it this way, let's say that Angelina Jollie announces that she's selling her parts. And we know that Angelina Jollie is very popular, so that's the reason why her parts are more expensive. We can also say that she have done some controversy so her value declines and people will be selling her parts to somebody else. People sometimes will take advantage of this because the value is now cheaper. But we know, Angelina Jollie is can regain people's trust and again will boost value. How do we know this? It's publicly displayed in the media. Media will be our market. We check the TV for news and see what's currently happening. From there, we can see the current status although in real world, their are tickers for this. Ticker names is like Apple is to APPL. Now let's say that Angelina Jollie's stock price was $50 when you bought her back in 2000 and today the price is $150 because you know, Angelina gains so much popularity she was all over the media. You decided to sell the stock and now you just made $100 out of your $50."

I’m not saying they can’t fuck each other and enjoy fucking each other, I’m saying that when it comes to relating, there is a giant gap, one which is incredibly unlikely to be bridged. Miracles happen, this dude could be one in 100 million, or, instead, he could be fooling around with a teeny bopper who is in over her head, which is much much more common."

Most stocks trade with an expectation of future earnings over time, or have debt which must be satisfied before equity, so dumping such a comparatively large dividend would potentially even violate the terms of the debt agreements, especially if such a move threatened the company with bankruptcy (which it may very well do, even if they can ""technically"" afford it)."

[Foreign language] There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was KRW 5 trillion with customer base of 1,720,000, by funding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to KRW 12.1 trillion with 5,370,000 customers as of April end of 2021. We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.""

This equates to a 312% customer increase in only 4 months.  Many advisors would believe this to be a strong positive sign of continued growth for KT Corporation in their financial sector but members are intelligent enough to come to this conclusion.  Along with the customer growth came deposit growth.  Deposits in KBank grew 242% in the same time frame.  If this is an illustration of growth in the beginning do you think they will sustain and beat the growth already recorded?  Kim Young-Jin -- Chief Financial Officer believes they absolutely will see continued exponential growth."

2021-05-21 17:35:18,wallstreetbets,As THC products get stronger the CBD companies are probably something worth investing in. CBD counteracts the effects of THC which are anxiety and paranoia and in certain cases where people overdose on THC which is easier than you'd think with edibles CBD can counteract most of these effects and bring them down. I couldn't tell you for certain if it will be those CBD companies that profit off of this or if it will be medical companies but I think this is going to be something that gets pursued in the future.

That $70M will seem like nothing in comparison to all the payroll taxes, state taxes, etc that they will have to pay.  Illinois state sponsored pensions are so underfunded it's not funny.  Should have stuck with Quebec.

Also, I don't believe Canada is mandating all EVs by 2035, just Quebec (1/4 of the population).

Even though it's owned by the Chinese, BYD has a factory in Ontario, Canada, which would put them in the running for any contracts.

Huge opportunity for these guys, provided they can provide good tech going forward.  We'll have to see how their batteries and motors stack up in 2-3 years."

And I just like the stock."
2021-05-21 14:37:36,wallstreetbets,"It'll take some time, we just have to be patient. While browsing through their financials, they definitely have some improvements to make. My question is, ""will they use their assets taken from Aphria effectively?"" We'll wait and see!"
2021-05-21 17:22:08,wallstreetbets,My dad has been asking me to find a cannabis company to drop some money on. I havent been able to find a listed company that doesn’t lose tens of millions every year. I haven’t read any updated info on TLRY but in 2018 they lost what 50mil? Do you have any other information that makes your bullish on TLRY besides the tea leaves
2021-05-21 17:29:48,wallstreetbets,"TLRY isn’t TLRY anymore, exactly. It was purchased by APHA, and APHA now wears the skin of TLRY. Sort of a ‘bug merger’ if you will. APHA had/has much more respectable financials which is what allowed them to be in a position to make that acquisition. Maybe you already know that, but it’s easy to miss since TLRY is the one still trading and the name most people recognize"
2021-05-21 17:27:48,wallstreetbets,"I'm not a professional fundamental analyst, but after browsing through their financials, I made a few observations (both good and bad):

- They've been working on cutting down Liabilities
- COGS and SG&A costs have been cut down
- They've had consistently negative operating income,  but that's consistently and drastically (as COGS and SG&A costs improve)
- Net Income is still negative but has improved drastically
- Total Equity has doubled
- Long-term Debt has been nearly halved
- CapEx is consistently negative but improving
- Accounts Receivables is inconsistent
- Net Cashflow is now positive and improving

It may take some time for them to mature, especially after their merger. What I want to make sure of is that they're using their assets effectively and efficiently, especially after they've acquired more through the merger. The big key we want to eyeball is their cashflow."
2021-05-21 17:44:45,wallstreetbets,"This is correct! There were some hints to me that Tilray may have been mismanaged a bit in the past. I'm not too sure in exactly what, as I'm not a professional fundamental analyst nor have I paid attention to Tilray for that long. No matter how many assets they have, poor management can lead to a crash and burn. So if you have any more insight on their leadership, I'd love to hear some of it!"

2021-05-21 13:52:46,wallstreetbets,"YOLO'D ALL IN AT 20$

Most of the reason the share value and public interest fell so drastically the last couple months was because VG didnt put out a single shred of publicity as to what was going on after the last failed test flight. 

Now that people know ""Oh damn their still here testing"" it will renew faith a little. 

I'd almost wager that even if the test flight fails, it might still go up."

2021-05-21 13:33:58,wallstreetbets,What’s your price target if it fails?
2021-05-21 13:40:05,wallstreetbets,"the weather will be trash tomorrow, flight will be delayed again, price will drop 20+% on monday"
2021-05-21 18:56:20,wallstreetbets,"This seems pretty realistic, $10 is a little low IMO."
2021-05-21 16:01:20,wallstreetbets,Only reasonable expectations I've seen.

2021-05-21 14:56:02,wallstreetbets,Well it was $60 not long ago on hopes that it would succeed. It didn’t succeed.. but what if it does? Over $60 at least.
2021-05-21 13:53:36,wallstreetbets,You had me until that last wager but I respect the balls on you
2021-05-21 14:08:50,wallstreetbets,Agree. Set up my straddle this morning at 20.
2021-05-21 15:44:11,wallstreetbets,Buy or sell??
2021-05-21 15:53:00,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn’t this be susceptible to IV crush then on the Off Off chance it succeeds or fails (but that was expected already... it seems everyone expects either..  so what’s the surprise?

2021-05-21 16:54:07,wallstreetbets,I think we will see an IV crush after the launch good or bad. Options prices will go down some because of this. I have a bear call spread that will lose on a success but gain some back on the IV crush and theta decay.
2021-05-21 13:45:36,wallstreetbets,"Ive been following SPCE for many years. They wont fly again unless they are 100% sure.  I know there is nothing 100% in life but VG wont fly unless they are 100% sure. they are flying tomorrow. They are de-risked at this point. A successful flight guarantees FAA certification and the beginning of commercial flights in 2022. Branson flies first. If the weather for whatever reason is not good, the back up date is Sunday. VG will fly and it will be successful. All investing is a risk. this is just a bigger one than most."

2021-05-21 13:59:31,wallstreetbets,"Lol thanks. Yeah I guess the last part might be wishful thinking. I just remember after the last test flight failed it dropped, but then the real attrition started when VG just went silent on everyone and all Branson did was tweet about nonsense social justice events"
2021-05-21 15:08:07,wallstreetbets,My broker no straddle or I’m too smooth brained to figure out how
2021-05-21 14:01:31,wallstreetbets,Second this on VG. I’ve been following it since 2009-10 when my father bought a ticket and their original plan was to be flying by 2013. Hopefully they get it right this time!
2021-05-21 14:59:04,wallstreetbets,"Bro they were trading at $50-$60 before the last test flight, why do you think only $30 if it’s a success this time? I bet the hype in this market right now would push it over $60 closer to $100"
2021-05-21 13:47:51,wallstreetbets,I don't know I guess I am in trouble then . . . still hope it will be delayed into next month
2021-05-21 18:34:08,wallstreetbets,There are additional things that have changed besides for just the flight itself Richard and Chamath have both reduced their holdings and ark sold out completely so that changes things
2021-05-21 15:24:56,wallstreetbets,Buy both a call and a put for the same strike and same expiration. If you're approved for options you can do it
2021-05-21 15:01:10,wallstreetbets,"More fear this time, and previous highs were during the SPAC boom. $60-$100 after Branson flies, if Blue Origin and SpaceX haven't made significant moves before then."
2021-05-21 18:38:17,wallstreetbets,Richard and chamath have both reduced holdings since then and ark sold out completely so that changes things for the price action

IPO at 24 dropped to 17 people screaming it was overpriced, lawsuits and now it's 300 a share one of the most profitable companies in the world. ABNB feels like this except it was profitable in 2019 before covid land hit.

This forced them to trim the fat and really focus to stay afloat when no one was traveling. If they can survive that, then they're going to flourish as people start dumping money into traveling as seen already.

2021-05-21 14:00:39,wallstreetbets,"Idiots in this thread, Jesus. Shortage issues? AMDs market share gains have slowed down due to shortages, they're selling every chip they can make.

When supply catches up to demand (which isn't happening for another year at least), their sheets will still look great because they'll start chipping away at Intel and Nvidias market share. With the Xilinx merger they'll become the largest customer at TSMC. As they start transitioning to 5 nm, they'll be able to allocate 7nm to lower margin GPU products, a segment which is currently neglected due to shortages, both by Nvidia and AMD.

Besides that, they just announced a $4b share buyback. AMD have never had this kind of free cash before. This is going to prevent any sub $70 targets, unless there's a very sudden macro cause, and even then they'll eat it up because they want to buy the shares at a decent price. The reason they're doing share buybacks and not investing in the company? They have no factories, so they don't need capital to increase production levels. They've already effectively maxed out on R&D, and as Intel have proven over the last 4 years, you can't throw extra money at semiconductor R&D to get better results.

Their product roadmap for the next 5 years is amazing and they have a proven track record of delivering.

They said themselves that their gpu lineup should get another 50%+ per/watt improvement next gen, and leakers who have been pretty reliable previously are pointing to much higher numbers.

In the CPU space, Intel's next two generations are no threat whatsoever, and AMDs iterative design approach means consistent gains in performance and power consumption every year. Intel's 10nm laptop CPUs can increase their performance by 10% for a 50% power consumption tradeoff. It proves how bad the state of their foundries really is.

The Xilinx merger is a big brain play if it goes through, which it should. It gives them the FPGAs necessary to chip away at Nvidias monopoly on machine learning. Xilinx already easily outperforms Nvidia here, but Nvidia has an ecosystem that needs to be broken. As we move towards smaller processing nodes, transistor size reductions will no longer be the way to get better performance. A mix of FPGAs, ASICs, and general compute units is the future. That's what AMD have recognised and why they're building an arsenal of integrated CPU and GPU products now. They're building the experience required to meet the demands of the future.

I don't have much money so I've got 265 shares via CFDs on 5x leverage. Assuming the Xilinx merger is successful, $100-130 EOY is easily manageable imo. It will likely take a hit after the merger as Xilinx owners sell their converted shares, but that's to be expected. With the guidance AMD have for this year it's also plausible they may increase the buyback program depending on demand/shortages, which could alleviate Xilinx sellers."
2021-05-21 13:10:59,wallstreetbets,If you're the guy who bought my december 17 $100 covered calls I want to thank you for the money
2021-05-21 15:40:53,wallstreetbets,Even if AMD will grow this year if there is a tech-sell of AMD will bleed a lot. I like AMD long term but short term it feels like the risk-reward is not worth it.

2021-05-21 13:22:39,wallstreetbets,It was already close to 100 on new years eve 2020. It dropped too much since. I have calls and keep them
2021-05-21 15:15:07,wallstreetbets,I mean if you're expecting some short squeeze then sure.
2021-05-21 15:02:33,wallstreetbets,"It's bonkers seeing AMD down to a 31x PE multiple, just by growing into their revenue so strongly. It was up past 150 for so long. 

Despite all the revenue growth, the stock hasn't moved higher, perhaps on chip shortage fears, but this will subside. I'm hoping TSMC sees what a chance they have here to grab more of Intels market share by preferring AMD as a partner. 

Imo Xilinx is the way to buy AMD right now, with the buyout paying you 1.7 AMD shares per, and trading under that right now."
2021-05-21 12:57:09,wallstreetbets,"Where are you getting the $100 figure from? Your arse? There are some big shortage issues looming, massive bottlenecks to work through for a lot of big players in this industry, and it's only getting more worrisome.. I agree that the big tech corps like AMD have a light at the end of the tunnel but it will not be this year IMO."
2021-05-21 15:07:37,wallstreetbets,You might at well donate your money to the food-bank if you’re going to consider a yolo for $100 call. $50 by year end isn’t even feasible.
2021-05-21 19:15:19,wallstreetbets,"yeah, but i want amd to be a 500 dollars stock, it deserves it, best processors out there at a great price, if only they’d also start going into evs, they’re the closest thing to having an nvidia like potential."
2021-05-21 13:54:38,wallstreetbets,Were you saying the same thing when it was 92 or so in January? My guy's analysis is all red and I pay him and he's great although a little off the mark with GME recently still I trust him more than a kid with crayons.

2021-05-21 18:10:45,wallstreetbets,"This comment is too intelligent for this sub. But I do agree with you and any points I have issue with would be, I suspect, arguing if orange is yellow-red or red-yellow."

2021-05-21 13:17:10,wallstreetbets,"Many companies performance are dependent on broader market conditions.

2021-05-21 19:45:17,wallstreetbets,"AMD is the only company offsetting material shortage by preemptively buying a couple bils in silicon. Furthermore, intel and nvid are two separate but
Similar places in the market and amc occupies both meaning they will produce more than their competitors by virtue of diversification of goods even in a overall shortage.

$100 is kinda low imo, but it’s a nice number for smooth brains"

2021-05-21 19:39:31,wallstreetbets,It's pretty rare that I wait for them to expire. I try to keep it within the year for tax reasons.

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"After almost 20 years of generally being very happy with Schwab, I am changing brokers. A short summary of my grievances. **EDIT TLDR: OG chuck built an amazing pro retail firm that others slowly turned into PFOF grubby flaming pile of shit.**

Can't believe I'm gonna throw shade on a firm I used to love but they have REALLY gone down hill.  Don't feel like writing a wall of text but want to warn others who are thinking of switching into them so I'm just going to bullet point problems I've had.  If you are with them already and feel so-so about them... there are better options out there.  Moving money is a pain in the ass but it might be worth it.

**Issues I've had with them**

* Margin approval is like pulling teeth.  They want to grill you to death for like half an hour and slowly increase your options approval one step at a time (honestly some of those guys seem like idiots and I'm not sure how they got their certifications).  If they don't like exactly how you answer questions even as an experienced trader that's been doing it for a while, they will delay your application by up to 6 months before you can try again.  That hasn't happened to me fortunately but apparently they do that so I'm always very anxious talking to them.  I have $600k ish with them in all my accounts and my risk per trade is typically capped at $50-60k.  I tend to have extra cash if I need to average down or add something to hedge my position.  Never used margin even though I have it since it's required to do a lot of different trades.

* Frequent outages (especially at market open), error messages, slow to load in the browser portal.  Desktop platform ""StreetSmart"" is terrible IMO but I suppose that is a matter of taste.  They're portal option trading is otherwise aright, I've seen better and worse but nothing to write home about.

* $1k recently mysteriously disappeared in my account.  They were quick to correct it and apparently it's some ""very rare"" programming error but who the fuck knows for sure.  I'm sure a lot of retards out there don't even notice if money is ever missing.

* Finally, something that has always bothered me is that their execution doesn't seem that good.  With options especially +/- a couple pennies (or nickel for larger contracts) can actually make a huge difference on your P&L for a trade.  They are THE LEADER in PFOF revenue.  Fuck them.


When I joined them close to 20 years ago, I worshiped Charles Schwab.  You can google him but he was Good Guy broker when no one cared about retail back in the day.  Basically the OG pioneered the discount brokerage business.  You should read about his life, such a cool mfer.  Anyways, the firm it is today is totally different and basically a scummy imposter just using the name, if you're thinking about joining.  DON'T.

**Edit 2:** to those who think trade execution doesn't matter, [a good post on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fdoq6o/ysk_execution_quality_is_far_more_important_than/)."

2021-05-21 17:34:40,wallstreetbets,"I have a IBKR and Schwab account and here are my observations:

Things that bother me with Schwab:

1. Higher options trading level approval is pain in the ass 
2. Margin rate is much higher
3. Pre/after hours market is not open for the whole duration, rather \~2h pre/post market
4. Street Smart Edge is unnecessarily complicated and slow to use. Besides, you can't trade all instruments in it - Futures can only be traded in Street Smart Central via browser. Although IBKR's TWS looks archaic, I find it more streamlined and faster in use.
5. You have to set up separate trades to buy/sell during regular and extended trading sessions (In IBKR you can tick the ""include extended hours"" box). This one is really annoying - for example, I want a GTC order to buy AAPL at $100. I don't care if it will be executed during standard trading session or after hours or tomorrow morning - I just want it bought (or sold) at a particular price. That's impossible to do with Schwab. You have to set it up separately for each and every extended hours trading. Super annoying.
6. Pre/post market is unavailable for 5 mins just before or just after standard trading session. There's no such 5 min break with IBKR. Super annoying.
7. Standard margin requirement for holding particular shares is 30%. If I sell cash covered put, it will require 100% margin. If put gets executed, and I'm assigned shares, the required margin will again be 30%. I guess this has something to do with your option level approval but I don't see why higher options approval level changes the basic math. Very illogical and super super annoying.

Good things with Schwab (comparing with IBKR):

1. Zero fee shares trading
2. Schwab zero fees debit card
3. Support is generally more knowledgeable and accommodating. IBKR has a great support as well only if you get a US customer service representative. The problem is most of the times you'll get Indian with poor knowledge of the products.

And here you are apes, those are my observations."
2021-05-21 10:53:04,wallstreetbets,"I have had Schwab for years and have not experienced anything that you just mentioned.

2021-05-21 16:42:48,wallstreetbets,Fidelity gave me 503 internal service overload errors for over 2 hours last night at the login screen.
2021-05-21 18:32:31,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, but fuck Fidelity. They're a SCUMBAG company and nobody should use them.

I opened a Fidelity account in late January to hop on the GME train. I gave them all my personal info, everything they asked for, all honestly. I trade for a month.

Then one day I log in to make an important trade and it says my accounts have been closed. No notification, no warning, just closed my accounts out of nowhere. 

I missed out on $10,000+ of profit on the RKT trade I was going to make. It doesn't even give a reason WHY they closed my accounts, and there is nothing you can do it address this issue on their website. YOU CAN'T EVEN WITHDRAW THE CASH YOU HAVE. THEY DISABLE THE CASH TRANSFER FEATURE, HOLDING YOUR MONEY HOSTAGE.

I call (this is a month after the GME squeeze, everything should have calmed down) and I'm on hold for TWO FUCKING HOURS.

I'm fucking livid. I demand to know why they closed my accounts, and they say they ""need more verification"" and they want me to fill out some IRS form or some shit with a bunch of personal info.

What the fuck? I already gave them all my info, and I have an extremely unique name so it's not like my info conflicted with someone else. These shitbags closed my accounts out of nowhere without even bothering to send me an email about it, causing me to lose out of thousands of dollars. They've essentially stolen my money by making it impossible for me to withdraw, AND they keep me on hold for two fucking hours. I demand they send my money back.

Here's the best part. FIDELITY REFUSES TO GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY. They insist that I HAVE TO fill out a form with a bunch of info then wait an indeterminate amount of time before I'm even allowed to withdraw my own money.

It's not until I start threatening to sue for theft and/or fraud that they send my money back to me.

Oh and I didn't even mention the ancient website design and retarded rules for sell order prices.

Fuck Fidelity. Shady, scumbag company. Don't use them."
2021-05-21 10:54:11,wallstreetbets,"Basically after a trade, my cash balance in my trading account didn't make sense.  So I have my own spreadsheet to track my trades outside of Schwab and low behold all the transactions showed correctly but somehow the total came out wrong."

2021-05-21 17:05:52,wallstreetbets,i LOVE the thinkorswim mobile app.  Can't really wrap my head around the desktop app yet though but I'm not that experienced yet and plan to learn it.  Thinkorswim mobile plus the regular website works well for me.  But i have a fidelity account and damn is that site off-putting.  It's like 1994 quickbooks level stuff.  I just can't stand to look at it
2021-05-21 14:03:26,wallstreetbets,As I mentioned in my other post.  I've heard good things about TD but they got bought by Schwab and I can no longer trust that company as the parent so it's a no-go for me.

2021-05-21 10:56:00,wallstreetbets,"Well I used to say the same.  Been there forever.  But maybe the massive PFOF money is changing them idk.  If you are buy / hold it's probably okay but I wouldn't trust them for options execution.

Although that said actually my dad moving to Fidelity after having problems with Schwab was also one of the straws that broke the camel's back.  He doesn't trade short-term, just boomer stuff but he likes to have an actual advisor to talk with and apparently the dude was just giving him straight up bad advice.

Edit: his new advisor at Fidelity he said he really likes and is sharp.  I don't use advisors bc I'm retarded so can't personally comment."

2021-05-21 10:50:21,wallstreetbets,😂 underrated comment!
2021-05-21 11:04:41,wallstreetbets,I switched to td and Robin Hood actually does give u way better prices and lower interest on options
2021-05-21 14:46:00,wallstreetbets,I used to think execution quality didn't matter but now I think it's a way bigger deal than most people think unless you're trading very small amounts.
2021-05-21 14:44:48,wallstreetbets,Got a lot of BRK.A lying around?
2021-05-21 11:20:30,wallstreetbets,For real?  Jesus.  I wonder if that's standard for all brokers.
2021-05-21 16:10:24,wallstreetbets,I've read you can get around this if you are on the streetsmart platform although I've not owned anything I can verify that with.
2021-05-21 16:10:43,wallstreetbets,Are you sure? I was under the impression this was only a limitation of setting limit sell orders. A market order over 10k share price wouldn't go through online?
2021-05-21 18:23:16,wallstreetbets,wow! is this true? where did you read that?
2021-05-21 18:46:14,wallstreetbets,100% false
2021-05-21 15:53:10,wallstreetbets,"IBKR and Fidelity were seamless, I don't get why Schwab makes you talk to these assholes for half hour, after waiting for 1-1.5 hrs, only to be told that I'm basically an idiot.

I legit want to buy $10k puts on SCHW regardless of how rationale it is a couple weeks before their July earnings."
2021-05-21 16:20:56,wallstreetbets,Even more reason not to do with business with Schwab which takes PFOF from the MM's like citadel.
2021-05-21 16:02:18,wallstreetbets,Yea me 2 but I can't blame Schwab for those.
2021-05-21 11:22:37,wallstreetbets,"Man maybe you had a good guy to talk to.  Even getting level 1 was a pain in the ass.  Actually level 2 was easier, maybe the guy was just chill.  Level 3 was the worst.

Honestly though I wouldn't trust them with options execution.  Shares probably don't matter though."
2021-05-21 18:13:38,wallstreetbets,"Omg yes vanguard 🤣 can't stand, it both desktop and mobile app. At least the fees are low"
2021-05-21 15:41:12,wallstreetbets,"Reading this makes me sad because I remember when I got my first job 20 years ago working at a department store, I was so proud to open up my first brokerage account with Schwab.

It was my first gig outta college, and even though I was minimum wage I tried my best to save at least a little and put it into index funds.  Customer service was awesome, they had really good checking services too.  Now I fucking hate the company with a passion, hiring such pieces of shit to work there."
2021-05-21 14:08:57,wallstreetbets,That was my level 2 experience funny enough.  Level 1 and 3 were a nightmare.
2021-05-21 12:41:53,wallstreetbets,Similar experience here
2021-05-21 10:44:06,wallstreetbets,Sorry in case you haven't heard.  Schwab bought you guys out.  Hope their grubbiness doesn't bleed over.  I can't trust a company that they are parent of.
2021-05-21 14:11:16,wallstreetbets,I'm so glad that this post seems to resonate with a lot of people and it wasn't just me having one weird unique experience.
2021-05-21 14:08:24,wallstreetbets,"That's what I keep hearing.  ""Leave Schwab for Fidelity"""
2021-05-21 14:04:55,wallstreetbets,"LMAO that's exactly how I felt about their options team customer service.  LONG ass wait times, just being talked down to like a child and not really servicing the customer."
2021-05-21 11:42:15,wallstreetbets,"They were, Schwab's MO was all about leveling the playing field for the little guys."
2021-05-21 15:59:48,wallstreetbets,"Apparently Fidelity is good.  I hear almost always good things.  Thus far I am very impressed but I just opened an account.

IBKR has excellent execution, rock bottom margin rates but the interface just wasn't for me.  Lack of free real-time quotes annoyed me too.  They're still better than scumbag Schwab though."
2021-05-21 14:17:55,wallstreetbets,"That's fine, at least Fidelity (thus far brief interactions) treats me like a Classy Retard worthy of their business.  Schwab just lets me know I'm a dumbass to my face but still wants me to keep paying them for the honor of treating me like that."
2021-05-21 14:47:02,wallstreetbets,"Whatever, they don't have to treat me like garbage.  Also doesn't change that their execution is shitty.

I know I'm an autist, doesn't mean you have to rub it in my face like they do."
2021-05-21 14:56:09,wallstreetbets,"Also I had the ""trading system unavailable"" and down a few days back in PRE MARKET at 7:30 am.  Do not tell me that is ""high volatility.""  Volume should not be a factor at all."
2021-05-21 12:49:02,wallstreetbets,"I got denied twice for options approval with fidelity, guess they know that I’m retarded with my money so I guess it ain’t that bad"
2021-05-21 10:37:00,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity will kiss anyone's ass with a 250k+ account.  

They are a lot less friendly with smaller accounts."
2021-05-21 13:46:49,wallstreetbets,Fidelity is amazing. The only bullshit I had with them is they had to charge me 25 dollars to direct rollover a 401k to a Trad IRA within their same institution. IE Fidelity was managing the 401k which I thought was some BS but probably valid. Otherwise zero fees on HSA. They are great.
2021-05-21 13:54:56,wallstreetbets,"If Fidelity doesnt have any major issues, can you do a follow up post? I really need to get my ass off RH"
2021-05-21 17:34:55,wallstreetbets,Schwab gave me level 3 when I first asked and had 0 experience
2021-05-21 18:39:32,wallstreetbets,Maybe Schwab has changed their options approval. I recently switched from Fidelity to Schwab and they approved me for margin and level 1 options in a couple days without even calling me
2021-05-21 18:49:44,wallstreetbets,ATP is a clunky pile of shit.  Worst trading platform ever.  TOS is the best platform.  TradingView has the best browser based charting I've ever seen plus backtesting and a kick ass screener.  In my opinion of course.
2021-05-21 10:56:53,wallstreetbets,That is a real fucking problem. I have so many trades in Schwab this would be a huge undertaking.
2021-05-21 12:36:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I bought some VXX calls before the 4-1 reverse split. I called and talked a derivs guy that treated me like the dumbest pussy he’d ever talked to."
2021-05-21 12:34:48,wallstreetbets,Sounds just like r/wsb
2021-05-21 17:36:39,wallstreetbets,Bizarre. Every time I talk to them they pat me on the back for my trades
2021-05-21 17:33:39,wallstreetbets,That's my thought about vanguard. Not user friendly in the least for both mobile and website. The app is just the browser version shrunk down.
2021-05-21 17:27:31,wallstreetbets,"Maybe that's why they bought TD, because they know they're trash. I personally love think or swim. For access to margins, options etc all I had to do was say ""I have X amount of knowledge and experience with these"" and they were all approved within a day or two.

Fidelity I've heard good things about and they're now going to have trade accounts open for kids and teenagers. Starting 'em young lol"
2021-05-21 12:37:27,wallstreetbets,Outside of not getting margin approval what options trading issues were you having?
2021-05-21 10:57:40,wallstreetbets,Cant go wrong with Fidelity.
2021-05-21 11:20:01,wallstreetbets,And now Schwab owns TD
2021-05-21 18:33:28,wallstreetbets,GME
2021-05-21 14:12:55,wallstreetbets,It's not. It's a boomer Schwab rule.
2021-05-21 12:40:57,wallstreetbets,"When I got lvl 1 approval the guy on the phone complimented me on my new account name....sT0nKs....

They're not so bad on the phone

Some people in life just suck and others are mayhe having a rough day/week/month. I know it's not part of your job to cheer them up but it's part of being human. You'll be surprised at the responses you might get to a seemingly agitated phone rep when you say something unexpected and offscript."
2021-05-21 18:52:31,wallstreetbets,"I've even gotten a price improvement on a limit order for options, just like shares.

0 interview for the levels, just a paper form. Appreciate your anecdote but don't feel like we're getting the full story"
2021-05-21 10:47:21,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I did hear that. Well everything is working normal, so I dont know what should be the worst case scenario any ways I have 2k account so not that worried"
2021-05-21 14:59:51,wallstreetbets,"Totally, I often wondered if I was just being paranoid and making shit up in my brain 🤣 thanks for talking about this so I know I wasn’t crazy"
2021-05-21 14:46:27,wallstreetbets,"That company sucks ass and knowing that Think or Swim/TD is owned (or partially owned) by CS tells you to stay away from that brokerage as well.  Damn, Charles Schwab truly pisses me off to think about their bullshit service and lack of response."
2021-05-21 16:07:07,wallstreetbets,Thank you !
2021-05-21 14:36:02,wallstreetbets,">lets me know I'm a dumbass to my face but still wants me to keep paying them for the honor of treating me like that.

That's way i hate most corps"
2021-05-21 15:43:22,wallstreetbets,"I’m just jokin my guy. Using WSB language, not coming at you personally lmao"
2021-05-21 13:50:07,wallstreetbets,"That's odd I just answered some questions and was approved with almost no experience trading, this was a few years ago so maybe things have changed."
2021-05-21 10:49:28,wallstreetbets,"What would happen if you get in with +250k then for some “retarded” reason you end up with less....

Will they keep treating you like a good boy?"
2021-05-21 13:49:37,wallstreetbets,This is every brokerage
2021-05-21 13:48:15,wallstreetbets,"Wrong, I have a small account with them sub 30k and they are awesome, also they have a physical location a few miles from my house."
2021-05-21 15:36:49,wallstreetbets,Tell me about it. Had to bitch them out in email exchanges for 2 months before I got my little $3000 account approved for anything other than buying and selling stock.
2021-05-21 10:38:55,wallstreetbets,Maybe that's why they were so nice haha.  If I fully move it'll be about 600k.
2021-05-21 14:03:50,wallstreetbets,"Yea, they're like one of the only brokerages where I haven't really heard any major issues with."
2021-05-21 14:02:37,wallstreetbets,!Remindme 1 month
2021-05-21 17:34:29,wallstreetbets,Do it like yesterday.
2021-05-21 14:02:18,wallstreetbets,Will do!
2021-05-21 10:58:48,wallstreetbets,"That's the thing, what if it happened before I started tracking or some shit.  Probably truly is rare and small if it does happen but fuck them with all the other problems I don't trust them."
2021-05-21 14:10:09,wallstreetbets,"I spoke one time to a guy that was chill and didn't make me feel like the biggest fucking idiot in the world, which was everyone else I interacted with there.  The cool guy helped me get to level 2 smoothly, whole chat was like 10 minutes, level 1/3 holy shit.  I felt like I was begging for a job there or smth.

I have a $600k account there, I don't care that you think I'm retarded, be a god damn professional you cocky mfers."
2021-05-21 14:07:27,wallstreetbets,"Execution quality seemed bad.  Slow to load pages / order statuses / change order on portal.

Trading system straight up having outages or temporarily just down for like 10 minutes when market was tanking last week for example.  Errors on displaying different option legs correctly.  Eg. ""you want to buy GME C 05/21 shares but have 100 GME contracts long""  It's like WTF that is completely reversed and confusing.  Just so much random little shit like that.  Plus the missing money which they fixed but still annoying."
2021-05-21 11:33:33,wallstreetbets,Well makes sense then
2021-05-21 19:01:23,wallstreetbets,"Well they told me I had to wait like 2 weeks or something with just the paper form.  So I called and asked if they could expedite, leading to the ""interview"".  They literally told me that if they want they can close my application for SIX MONTHS if they desire.

Like I said elsewhere, level 2 was fine.  It was level 1 and 3 where I felt like I was treated like I was the biggest idiot ever spoken to.  I've gone through two other brokers now, IBKR and Fidelity.

All I can say is that it has been 100x easier.  Based on other posts on this thread it seems I am not the only one with very negative experiences *shrug*.

Edit: also just because you get a price improvement doesn't mean they have good execution... surely you see that?"
2021-05-21 15:45:30,wallstreetbets,"Dude I don't mind the autism part at all.  I am a grade A autist and retard.  

I'm just saying the whole outage thing is nonsense, I don't think it's an ""every broker"" thing.  I heard they are behind in tech and it wouldn't surprise me if that's totally true."
2021-05-21 10:52:02,wallstreetbets,"No. 

Better than UBS where they start charging you more if you drop below 250k."
2021-05-21 19:26:13,wallstreetbets,i also called them and got approved for level 1 options with 300 dollars in my ira if your wanting to do more yeah they probably suck but all i do is otm calls like a true retard so thats all i really needed
2021-05-21 17:28:54,wallstreetbets,Holy shit I have to call them and i dont want to wait hours on the phone. I use webull and its a pos for trading would never use  but i like the graphs and free stuff they do.
2021-05-21 14:14:24,wallstreetbets,Yea I think the missing money is the biggest thing and appreciate you bringing that to the rest of our attention.
2021-05-21 14:58:14,wallstreetbets,Hate UBS
2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Galactic (SPCE) Curious about y’all’s thoughts on SPCE..?

I think either going to the moon, or it’s going to crash and burn (quite literally). 

They are in the market of passenger space flights. It’s really between them and SpaceX, but Virgin Galactic is publicly traded, and less known. They hit a high around $55 last February, and after a few setbacks, it’s sitting around $20. After a first quarter with zero revenue, they announced yesterday that they will be resuming test flights as early as Saturday."
2021-05-21 10:28:33,wallstreetbets,"Picked up some shares two months ago.  Will likely be a while but figured why not.  Space flights will happen eventually, the kicker is the *when* that they’ll happen."
2021-05-21 10:40:54,wallstreetbets,Yea I bought at like $50 so I'm loooooong
2021-05-21 11:46:14,wallstreetbets,"If you don't gamble on stuff like this, then not sure what you are doing... place a bet man"
2021-05-21 10:31:03,wallstreetbets,I feel the same as you. I’ve got a few shares that I’m holding but it’s not something I’d throw big bucks at.
2021-05-21 10:34:17,wallstreetbets,"It’s simple. If you believe they will be successful this is a great entry point. The hype is no where near any other flight announcement. 30-35 before flight Dec 55-60 before flight Feb. They have done everything to prove they are being safe after their disaster which has come with many delays but now they  need to prove they can do this consistently for this stock to take really off. If they are successful this weekend, There will be a significant increase before open Monday. So it’s a gamble now. If successful this flight and the next 2 following flights the stock price will really take off."
2021-05-21 10:43:36,wallstreetbets,"I'm bullish (and long,big) on them overall long term but it's prob a good time for a straddle. Two most likely options are success or delay. Delays at this point will probably be a nail in the coffin on investor confidence."
2021-05-21 10:58:38,wallstreetbets,"Just bought a couple calls. I don’t think they will delay. They need this. 

5/28 $26c"
2021-05-21 11:58:10,wallstreetbets,"I’m all in rn, tanked pretty hard along with a lot of other high growth stocks but holding through the test flight and beyond"
2021-05-21 10:28:15,wallstreetbets,I would buy some shares but every time i go to my brain goes no thats stupid dont. Honestly dont know if i should or not....
2021-05-21 11:43:38,wallstreetbets,"SpaceX is not their competition, at all. SpaceX are orbital class rockets meant to deliver payloads (and maybe travelers) out of orbit. Virgin and Blue Origin are sub-orbital. The possibilities, market positions, and overall go-to-market are very different."
2021-05-21 13:29:18,wallstreetbets,Winds are forecasted to be right down the runway from the south with a high scattered clouds. Absolutely nothing weather wise that is gonna stop this from launching.
2021-05-21 18:16:48,wallstreetbets,"I bought some yesterday looking for a home run, we’ll see."
2021-05-21 10:35:15,wallstreetbets,"It seems like an amazing organization and venture but not a viable source of revenue and therefore, not a viable source of profit. There aren't any real commercial opportunities for this - it's a fun adventure model for the uber wealthy."
2021-05-21 10:33:05,wallstreetbets,With the way their stock and company is going they should rebrand themselves to passenger flights to the center of the earth
2021-05-21 10:48:54,wallstreetbets,"I am a bagholder and have been telling people to stay away. Their leadership is terrible and they've touted their test launch like 5 times now. 

Investing in SPCE was one of my worst moves in 2020."
2021-05-21 11:54:07,wallstreetbets,"My prediction: test flight is a failure, but justified as a learning experience. Virgin Galactic investigates the matter whilst Chamath manages his liquidity."
2021-05-21 12:43:20,wallstreetbets,"People are prepared to pay millions to fly to space and back. 
I was going to carry on and hypothesize about other revenue streams but I’ll just leave it there."
2021-05-21 10:37:45,wallstreetbets,"I got a few shares around the current price, during the May dip. I figured the upside is pretty high, and the risk makes sense for my portfolio. Their schedule is way ahead of SpaceX for test flights... but if Virgin Galactic crashes a test flight, they seem doomed."
2021-05-21 12:30:30,wallstreetbets,Short squeeze!!
2021-05-21 12:52:34,wallstreetbets,"I have 5 puts expiring Monday, one hugely out of the money call (is gon moon if it works), and a few shares. I’m a baby. Mostly think it’s gonna fail but I want to at least make up for the puts if it succeeds"
2021-05-21 13:53:21,wallstreetbets,"Bot 100 shares and sold cc.  Max profit in 2weeks, 400, max loss 2000."
2021-05-21 12:12:00,wallstreetbets,"Time to buy puts on this trash. Nobody is going to the moOoOon 😂

No revenue and no hope with Chamath n the social peodphilia group selling their stake in this dumpster fire"
2021-05-21 14:11:47,wallstreetbets,"Both Blue Origin and SpaceX are likely going to beat Virgin in sending tourists to space.

Virgin has failed to prove that their space plane is cheaper or more reliable than using rockets. Until they can do that they are going to get trampled by SpaceX and Blue Origin. 

I sold all my SPCE shares. They might get enough hype going for their next flight attempt to get back to $30 but I think it will be trading around $10 by the end of the year."
2021-05-21 17:18:16,wallstreetbets,"They had to, the stock is literally tanking."
2021-05-21 12:33:11,wallstreetbets,Virgin Galactic is an amusement park ride that should have been in operation a decade ago...
2021-05-21 11:25:25,wallstreetbets,"ha, my average price is in the 40s.  both branson and chamath have dumped shares, which isnt a confidence builder.  still holding onto shares, because at this point, why not"
2021-05-21 10:42:43,wallstreetbets,"Both of those previous highs were during the SPAC boom when everything SPAC related was going absolutely insane.

This company was valued at $2.2B when it merged in late-2019 and it has done nothing but miss deadlines in the 1.5 years since.

What possible argument is there for this thing to be worth 2x/3x/5x/7x that $2.2B valuation? Has anything changed for the positive since merger?

All that said, it’s 2021 so maybe this runs completely out of control on momentum again."
2021-05-21 11:36:00,wallstreetbets,Biggest hurdle is not the delay itself but the actual launch going perfectly well. Odds are they rarely do because again one thing is to build a rocket and another is to successfully launch into space without any problems. Even Nasa and Elon's company has hiccups and problems what makes you think SPCE won't with a high probability of messing up. Puts should be your higher chance of making money.
2021-05-21 18:41:03,wallstreetbets,You won’t know until you should or not until you know... ya know?
2021-05-21 11:58:03,wallstreetbets,"Elon Musk has stated his intention to launch passenger flights via SpaceX. It’s the Space Tourism industry. How is that different than passenger flights by Virgin Galactic? Are you just making your statement based on the fact that SpaceX has more operational areas, whereas Virgin is solely focused on passenger flights?"
2021-05-21 11:34:06,wallstreetbets,Buy puts. Knowing that this company is run by incompetent people it is clearly going to get postponed another time. I think this is a hype company to promote space or even Richard Branson himself.

2021-05-21 10:51:09,wallstreetbets,"Not that I give a shit about analysts, but if you’re really curious and not just straw-manning, go do some research. The street is overweight and PTs range from $18-$50. Plenty of arguments and models to be made either way."
2021-05-21 12:25:02,wallstreetbets,Nasa and SpaceX don't launch from an airfield like a normal plane with a mothership and then head to sub-orbital heights. Mechanically speaking launching vertically with a rocket is a whole other kind of hurdle. Personally I hope everything goes well to sell these 26 bags asap but comparing Spce to those companies *launch-risks wise* is just wrong.
2021-05-21 11:41:15,wallstreetbets,"They all have hiccups, but failure rate on launches across the industry is like 5-10%. SPCE may fail for sure, but odds are definitely in their favour. It’s not their first time to space."
2021-05-21 12:34:57,wallstreetbets,The biggest hurdle is a delay...my options expire on the 28th!!!
2021-05-21 13:52:28,wallstreetbets,"What im saying is people need to be more cognizant of the different obtainable customers for opportunities to “tour space” through virgin/Blue or spaceX. Orbital travel will require a lot of training (literally for the participant, on top of what virgin/blue travelers already have to get) to be comfortable with the 3-5G load sustained in flight. Things like this point to spce and blue being the primary adoption vessel for “tourism” for whatever that experience will become. 
A couple minute view above the VK line and weightlessness? Or a a couple day stay in a space station? One is further fetched then the other and theres a reason why SpaceX is staying private/sustaining off of satellite launches/iss trips. I know someone can’t wait to suck Elon off and say “but wait! Some billionaire already agreed to be the first tourist, spacex to the moon!” Thats not going to happen for a few years, let alone, the average billionaire. What a world."
2021-05-21 16:09:04,wallstreetbets,Thanks y’all. 🚀🌝
2021-05-21 12:59:39,wallstreetbets,Good bot.
2021-05-21 10:57:11,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but as is the case for every “business of the future”, there are always people on both sides, some think it’s revolutionary, others think it’s useless garbage 

All I’m asking is, why is the company worth 5x what is was a year and a half ago?"
2021-05-21 14:21:05,wallstreetbets,"Besides the differentiation between orbital/suborbital space flight, another aspect that doesn’t get enough attention is:

Space Planes vs Rockets

Virgin Galactic’s success is predicated on proving that space planes are a cost-effective and reliable vehicle. Over the last 20 years no one has been able to get any kind of reliability out of space planes.  And if Virgin can’t solve this problem in the next couple years they are screwed."
2021-05-21 11:02:48,wallstreetbets,"When you’re pre-rev like this you’re being heavily discounted against the risk of it never working. As the risk of that subsides, the tolerance to buy into and trust the long-term opportunities grows. One may believe there’s a strong 10 year outlook for the company but until they demonstrate they can actually start, that 10 year outlook carries too much risk for real money. So if they tackle those early hurdles, they’re not a night and day different company vs before, but the risk becomes night and day vs before. SPCE investors right now are essentially public VCs."
2021-05-21 11:16:06,wallstreetbets,"That’s all perfectly reasonable.

I think the disconnect is occurring in time horizon. They have still never even had a successful test, and with a best case scenario this weekend this company is likely still a year away from commercialization (assuming there aren’t anymore delays down the line with further testing, and tbh, I don’t know if that’s a safe assumption)

Despite this running to nearly $60/sh in February, I just think people are being a bit overly optimistic in the short-term"
2021-05-21 11:22:41,wallstreetbets,"Also, there’s currently 0 shares available to short, so that could move things unnaturally again."
2021-05-21 11:19:13,wallstreetbets,"Yep, and with each successful test the perceived risk to near-term commercialization drops significantly. So again, the company won’t have changed much today to Monday but the risk will have a lot (up or down). That will be reflected in the SP, but unlikely to move like it did last time around."

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if buy Myovant (MYOV) &#x200B;

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money.  This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when.  How can I be so sure?  They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.  

Should you trust me?  Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips.  Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago?  We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist?  What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill.  Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.  

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal.  They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year.  Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay? 

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no.  They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted.  Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap.  They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner.  Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth.  The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here.  Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks.  You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear.  No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential?  Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself.  Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued.  MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down  - whatever could they do with that cash?  $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down.  With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them.  And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone.  FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one.  Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point.  It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason.  FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution:  they will monitor bone density.  That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer.  Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs.  Truly can’t fucking lose.  so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese."

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Alien Trade The government is releasing the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) report as early as June 1st. It was Congressionally mandated in the last stimulus bill and gave the government 180 days to release an unclassified report to the general public and a classified report to congress. We are approaching that time, and June/July could be a heavy shift in perspectives and R&D priorities. [Sen. Rubio's Comments](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ufo-reports-should-be-taken-seriously-rubio-says-11621245038) [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/23/ufo-report-covid-bill/)

These UAP’s exhibit unexplainable flight characteristics: near instantaneous acceleration, airplane/submersible hybrid characteristics, visual disappearance, odd acoustics, etc. Also, multiple “types” of craft have been observed. 

There are patents filed by the Navy for inertial mass reduction craft (basically creating a quantum vacuum around the craft to avoid air/water resistance; useful to go Mach 16+ in the atmosphere). Here’s the patent: [Triangular UAP Patent?](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10144532B2/en). Additionally, we have heard rumors (and they may just be rumors) of anti-gravity temporal displacement craft. These craft can accelerate by utilizing gravity waves, bend light through a gravity well (stealthy), and externally perceived time could be affected as well (think Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar) ([Gravity Wave Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10322827B2/) ) This UAP sightings might be manned craft or something else, or a mixture of both. These patents could also be counter-espionage missions to throw foreign countries off true technological breakthroughs, but we do know there was a demo of the tech: [Navy acknowledging demo, but not production ready](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37134/emails-show-navys-ufo-patents-went-through-significant-internal-review-resulted-in-a-demo)

Okay great, so what’s the play…

**Long-Raytheon ($RTX)** has the Advanced Targeting Forward Look Infrared Sensor, which can be utilized to track UAP’s. This technology has been out for over a decade. Additionally, Raytheon is the go-to company for research into lasers, targeted radiation, or proton beams (still no word on proton torpedoes). ([UFO Targeting Pod](https://sofrep.com/news/following-pentagon-admission-raytheon-touts-gear-ufo-spotter/))

**Long-Lockheed Martin ($LMT)** a major defense aerospace firm, which developed many prototypes over the years and is famous for the Skunkworks R&D lab. Former Senator Harry Reid believes Lockheed has UAP fragments in their possession ([UAP Fragments](https://deadline.com/2021/04/ufo-fragments-in-possession-lockheed-martin-says-harry-reid-1234748095/)). These fragments are believed to be made of an unknown metal/alloy, and potentially 3D printed at an atomic level.

**Long-Northrup Grumman ($NOC)** is a defense giant which developed the B-2 stealth bomber and is a contractor on multiple space infrastructure missions. They would be vital for advanced composites/metallurgy, advanced avionics, spaceflight, and tracking systems.

Additionally, we have no clear knowledge of where the Chinese and Russians are at with this technology. Maybe this is partly why we founded Space Force? This is a \~2 month play to see if we can get more decisive acknowledgement of the technology whether it is manned or alien, either way it could make for an interesting news summer."

Not a bad first attempt. I have been following the whole UAP thing in some detail. Recognise everything you have mentioned. However, cannot see a tradable angle yet. I get why you mention these stocks, but cannot see anything happening this year that would say these businesses would significantly benefit. 
 
I am still trying to get my head around the 5 Navy UFO patents, which are mind blowing. If any of those get implemented then whichever company is involved will moon!  LMT and NOC are potentially good calls, if you believe those technologies actually are being developed. Timing for any type of trade is unknown.

The start is a little dated and well not that good but the rest is good."
2021-05-21 18:04:04,wallstreetbets,The last time I saw this movie was at Fort Chaffee Arkansas. On the last night of a big river assault exercise we strung up bed sheets between some bunks and used the company projector to watch both predator movies. Filled trash cans with ice and hundreds of beers. That was a good night.
2021-05-21 18:20:48,wallstreetbets,Its on Hulu - watched it last week.

2021-05-21 11:51:48,wallstreetbets,My entire childhood I had Carl Weathers and Billy Dee Williams confused as being the same person. This is made funnier by the fact that I watched Star Wars and Predator repeatedly in the 90s

2021-05-21 18:47:48,wallstreetbets,He did.  So did the grenadier guy who got fucked up by the log trap. They nearly get his injured ass to safety and then he just takes a plasma blast to the side of the head.
2021-05-21 18:55:54,wallstreetbets,Billy chose to challenge the Predator 1v1
2021-05-21 12:02:06,wallstreetbets,Yes haha but if we posted only Predator memes with people who live it would just be Arnold haha too many good scenes to appreciate

2021-05-21 12:52:13,wallstreetbets,Yes but if we only did memes on who was alive it would just be Arnold. Too many scenes to appreciate in this movie!
2021-05-21 13:47:26,wallstreetbets,Think they would get a lot of people coming in to watch these movies to fill the gap until the new movies start showing
2021-05-21 15:24:34,wallstreetbets,"I rented a theater for $99 and watched Beverly Hills Cop recently with 5 friends. I'd totally do it again, and again, and again, even after normal. They sent me a survey after, sounds like it's being considered."

2021-05-21 18:16:58,wallstreetbets,I love how my mother let me watch this as a 9 year old. It should be shown in school today.
2021-05-21 16:56:35,wallstreetbets,I mean I love the movie but it is totally cheese. Greased up body builders dual wielding SMGs is peak 80s action cheese.

2021-05-21 14:57:26,wallstreetbets,"This movie was probably the pinnacle of 80's action films.  The cast, the premise, and the action set pieces are all phenomenal. But it's more than that.  The cinematography, the pacing of the story, almost everything about how this movie was crafted is masterfully done.  It's a case study in how to do ""dumb action"" right."

2021-05-21 11:37:44,wallstreetbets,"Good point. This movie is still fantastic. I guess I’m speaking more to 80s and before action, sci-fi, and horror movies generally. Perhaps the feeling is more to do with them not being the final survivors  lol."

2021-05-21 17:00:36,wallstreetbets,"Ha fair point but the tone is totally serious, no goofiness or straight humor thrown in besides the jokes in the helicopter which was really character building IMO.

2021-05-21 19:44:48,wallstreetbets,"Aliens  2 is one of the most copied movies of all time, especially in video games. The over the top tough as nails Sergeant in Halo? Copied from Aliens 2. The line  “I like to keep this one for close encounters” from one of the 46466 Call of Doodies? when referring to a shotgun? Copied from Aliens 2. The tough female heroine who keeps her shit together while everyone else is falling to pieces? Had anyone done that before Ripley? Sarah Connor didn’t become badass until T2

Off-topic, but I respect Ridley Scott a lot. He’s like a slugger in baseball…he always swings for the fences but he strikes out a lot. Raised by Wolves redeems Prometheus"

How Fox continued to miss the mark on Alien and Predator movies after such a great start is beyond incredible to me. The AvP crossovers should have been slam dunks but they turned in to garbage.
I wonder if Disney will do ANYTHING productive to them without making them cash grabs to sell Alien or Predator plushes to the kids."

Do NOT watch the 2000’s movie that shares the same name. It was formulaic Hollywood crap."
2021-05-21 14:18:07,wallstreetbets,"A classic 80’s horror flick based off a novel from the 40’s. Decent practical effects for the time too. 

Some genius at TBS would play the 25th anniversary edition during the winter of 2007 every time a big blizzard would be predicted. Having the wind howling and blowing snow outside added a lot of atmosphere. Have a look at it, it holds up pretty well."

2021-05-21 14:50:13,wallstreetbets,"So I was thinking about Alien as I wrote that other comment. Predator and Alien are two of my favorite movies ever, but I put them in like 2 different sub genres.

Predator: man vs monster, but it's a team of highly trained humans vs a highly trained monster. I place it in the ""monster action movie"" sub genre.

Alien: also a man/woman vs monster, but the situation is so different, and I dont mean space vs jungle. Alien is a group of ""everyday blue collar"" individuals stuck on a space ship with limited supplies and no where near the same combat skills as the elite soldiers in predator. They had to figure out a solution to their monster problem that wasnt just, ""lets do what were best at: kill"". I put this in the ""horror/survival monster movie"" sub genre.

That way, I can legitimately say they're both my favorite movies for their ""sub genres"". Both amazing movies.

Thank you for coming to my ted talk."

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"It's time I let you in on my secret: balls deep in $CSIQ Canadian Solar $CSIQ

**Legitimate company and not a meme?** Yes. 

20 year old company with a solid balance sheet, solid earnings, profitable every quarter, and beat EPS consistently all of last year. Every damn quarter they provided positive guidance, yet the wallstreet cucks would still under-cut their expectations, only for CSIQ to crush earnings.

**Does it have a future?** Yes

They make fucking solar panels, and have been doing it for 20 years! Tesla solar roofs are meme products. When my employer wanted to add solar panels for our 3 factories, we didn't call up Tesla. We called up a EPC firm who chose Canadian Solar as the supplier.

**What are the numbers?** Yes.

Lots of cash, lots of assets, low debt, consistent income etc.

**Are there any catalysts that would make it moon?** Yes

This post

**Positions?** Yes

600 shares since 2012. I bought them when I started making real money in my adult job. I was an intern at Canadian Solar in 2009.

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Guaranteed Buyout and Doubling of Funds if grab Myovant (MYOV) &#x200B;

The only thing certain in life is death and taxes – well add to that list the fact that Myovant is going to be bought out and when it does you’ll double your money. This isn’t some wishy washy bullshit oh it’s going to be bought out by big pharma since they have such a good product or such good potential, they are going to be bought out by a Japanese pharma company named Sumitomo it’s just a question of when. How can I be so sure? They already own 54% of the company which they acquired at the same time as 4 other companies that all end in vant and each of those 4 other companies is now fully owned with Urovant being the last one to be bought out at like 95% premium in the fall.

Should you trust me? Am I financial advisor – good god no but I am a doctor so maybe you should trust me but more so to remove whatever the fuck you have stuck up your ass rather than to give you stock tips. Does this sound a little like what Lipkissy posted a week ago? We work together and he made the kool aid and I drank it in believing in this company and you can’t lose.

**What is it?**

Their drug is a GNRH antagonist? What the fuck does that mean – fuck if I know I did med school 10 years ago but the end result is they can use the drug to treat prostate cancer in men or Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis in women when sold as a combo drug with the birth control pill. Hormone sensitive Breast Cancer is the holy grail and should be in the offing to be studied soon which will rocket the stock.

**Ready for Primetime?**

They didn’t just do some shitty company sponsored study that is on their website, they have been published twice in the New England Journal of Medicine – kind of a big deal. They are already FDA approved for prostate cancer and will be approved for Uterine Fibroids before June 1 and then Endometriosis next year. Oh and did I mention that they just got approved this morning for fibroids in Europe – think FDA is going to delay?

**Sell themselves at any cost?**

Hell no. They got a $4.2 billion dollar partnership with Pfizer for half of their lead drug meaning that they will have the weight of Pfizer marketing and distributing it and it means they have the funds to continue on their own if they wanted. Added bonus – Pfizer’s big Prostate Cancer XTANDI has to be paired with this type of medication and its oral also – or I guess you could get your nuts lopped off but I think most people would rather have the pill.

**Buyout Price**

This sucker ain’t going cheap. They are FDA approved for prostate cancer and the massive market of Uterine Fibroids is 2 weeks away with Endometriosis around the corner. Sumi owns 54% of the outstanding shares but isn’t allowed to buy the whole company without approval of a majority of the other shareholder who all know what this is worth. The non-SUMI board members all have to agree and guess who that includes – former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – not piece of shit pharma we have here. Going rate for takeovers is at least 100% premium and they have even ticked up to 130% in recent times.

**Sumiwho?**

Sumitomo Dainippon is a massive Japanese pharma with their best drug being the psych drug Latuda that is about to come off patent and they are shitting bricks. You don’t have to speak Japanese to read some DD on their IR site and see the genuine fear. No problem they have lots of cancer drugs in the pipeline with huge potential? Ha no such luck as they had 3 pretty high profile flops of their oncology drugs in a company where Treating Cancer is one of their 3 priorities – hmm if only they had this drug that could treat prostate cancer and literally save men’s lives by not having them die of heart attacks which is actually what is more likely to kill them than the cancer itself. Especially if they are on the dirty old injectable drug Lupron which Myovant’s drug absolutely crushed in the New England article.

**Why buy now?**

Ya you fucked up not getting it when it was like $17.50 dragged down by Biotech just utterly shitting a brick but this is still preposterously undervalued. MYOV had strong earnings last week and Sumi reported as well last week showing almost $2 billion in cash on hand a billion more than last year with R&D expenses going way down - whatever could they do with that cash? $44 a share wouldn’t even cost them that $2 billion and would lock this down. With June 1stFDA deadline for a decision on Fibroids the stock is primed to run up into that and shoot up post approval as the scripts start flowing in – remember this isn’t some shitty ass sales team this is the might of Pfizer behind them. And we got the Fibroids decision today for Europe and I can’t see America falling behind and letting them get the approval alone. FDA has been known to hand down early approval for drugs they’ve already approved in new indications like this one. Lots of money flowing in from these regulatory approvals triggering milestone payments and Pfizer might give them $50 mil more to license in Europe for prostate cancer at any point. It’s down today because of the market and quite literally the stupidest reason. FDA put a parital hold on their study evaluating if the combo drug prevents pregnancy until they monitor bone density – the solution: they will monitor bone density. That was its biggest advantage over competitors in their fibroid and endometriosis studies.

**Summary**

Kick ass product with pretty much guaranteed buyout that gets more expensive as the days go on – doesn’t that sound like incentive for them to get their ass in gear and make an offer. Even if they don’t Myovant has zero debt, zero risk of an offering, cash coming in left right and center and a hell of an opportunity to make a killing on their drugs. Truly can’t fucking lose. so why is it trading so cheap? Well cause no one knows about it, and the upside is only written down in Japanese."
2021-05-21 10:38:12,wallstreetbets,Well it sounds like a decent company but you make is sound like GNRH antagonists are something new. There are quite a few GNRH AND LNRH antagonists already approved and commonly in use. Think Lupron as example and used for these same indications for decades.
2021-05-21 10:37:54,wallstreetbets,Did some work on Kisspeptin and was following myovants trial closely - they in-licensed the compound from Takeda. Myovant is a subsidiary of ROIVANT which is an umbrella company who acquires “failed” clinical compounds and repurposes them for other indications - they basically do piggy back drug development and this is smart AF. This Doc Autist makes sense to me. Myovant is a likely acquisition target and given SUMO already own 54% of the company who the fuck else is going to buy 46% percent of a company - it’s got to go to SUMO

Well, October seems the answer.

From Wiki: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_largest\_daily\_changes\_in\_the\_Dow\_Jones\_Industrial\_Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average)

I know, in the last week many talked about a possible future crash in the stock market, inflation and there is too much liquidity and bla bla bla. I am not here to say the next crash will occur this October or on any other date (I well know that correlation is not causation). I have no subtle purpose to share, it's just for the curiosity of this pattern.

p.s. Probably the cause is because October is my birthday.

I don't know if there is something to discuss this, but I would appreciate your opinions.

# TA Notes

* Resistance still at 416-418 gap fill on the 1d timeframe
* Support at 415-414
* 20 SMMA support. I believe we need to test the 20 SMMA so this will be dip buying opportunity if bullish.
* Expecting small moves today. Play tight and ITM 0dte if you're a degen.
* Bulls need to break 418 and test support. I think we top out at around 420 if 418 support holds.
* Bears need to break 414. I don't think we go below 410 tho but we shall see.
* Bullish 🎯 - 419 - 420 - 420.53 - 422.29
* Bearish 🎯 - 412 - 410 - 409.08 - 408.07 - 407.12
* Not pictured but we are at the upper level of the BB. BTFD if bullish.

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"FUBO: amazing quarter 1 results FuboTV posted its Q1 results on the 11th. Seasonality in sports is obviously huge, with Q1 and Q2 being the worst periods of the season.

Consequently, there was always a sequential decline in the number of subscribers in Q1 and Q2 in 2019 and 2020. Typically between -8 and -9% sequentially. Given the amazing performance that was achieved in Q3 and Q4 last year, it was heavily expected that this Q1 would again see a decline in paid subscribers.

And then the results were published. For the first time in its history, Fubo delivered a sequential growth in paid subscribers and revenue in a Q1! The inflection point as been passed, the business momentum is stronger than the seasonality of sports. Looking ahead, with the Olympics, the soccer world cup qualifiers, the main leagues restarting everywhere, I expect massive growth in paid subscribers.

Now, onto the revenue side. The ARPU is approximately constant at around 69$/month since Q3 2020. The low seasonality of Q1 means that the relative share of ARPU due to the advertising is quite low compared to Q3 and Q4 last year. Which means that a great improvement of the subscription ARPU has been reached in Q1!

Now, when we'll go into Q3 and then Q4, with the absurd growth in number of subscribers and the massive gains from advertising, I'm expecting the ARPU to again grow. Expected advertising growth is 100% YOY.

And what happens when you combine massive subscribers and ARPU growth? You have massive results.

The cherries on the cake are:

1. Fubo betting which comes as a free version in Q3 and then paid version in Q4. It can be massive as Fubo will be the only player in the industry to control end to end the viewer/bettor experience.
2. International expansion, in Europe first probably, starting in 2022.
3. Accepting wagering in unconventional currencies.

The potential is so large it's not a cherry anymore, but rather a pineapple on the cake 🍍🎂

TLDR: Long Fubo 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-05-21 09:14:25,wallstreetbets,Bag holder checking in.
2021-05-21 10:58:37,wallstreetbets,"Fubo bull . 

Need to consider the bear case here also; Fubo customer acquisition costs were high to accomplish there subs numbers. Now what is there retention rate ? That will be the key metric. 60$ / month is quite pricey for a streaming service I’d like them to offer more tiered pricing.

$60 /month is a lot of money for euro poors. 

The ad growth number was promising but still a paltry 6million.

Need to see tangible progress on Fubo bet. No idea what the product looks like rn or the cost to build and run. I’d personally like to see partnerships with mlb , nba etc where Fubo gains viewing content and data in return for a split of betting profits. This will drive user numbers. the increased ad revenue and subs revenue  is still going to be there bread and butter. 

Long on fubo but I think it’s still high risk potentially very high rewards for the stock"

2021-05-21 12:51:41,wallstreetbets,Because you have to believe in betting being thing for this to actually have value. They are just a new cable provider currently. The margins on that are not great.
2021-05-21 12:56:49,wallstreetbets,"The way I see it is as follows: 
1) start getting the ball rolling with getting momentum in paid subscribers. Low margin. Done.
2) leverage the data to push tailored advertising which is impossible on TV. High margin. Ongoing.
3) complete the experience with wagering. High margin.
 In development.
4) people who came for content convert to wagering. People who came for wagering convert into subscribers."
2021-05-21 12:59:18,wallstreetbets,I just don't see what is going to make their sports book stand out. Not to mention I think wagering is a few scandals and increased broken homes away from being legislated out.
2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$AUPH is easy decision even for smooth brain apes This is my first deep dive so be gentle. No crayons no pictures no colors, just facts and fundamentals.

Voclosporin, the first FDA-approved oral therapy for lupus nephritis, will be sold as Lupkynis by Aurinia Pharmaceuticals and is approved for use in conjunction with immunosuppressive treatment. And a quick Google search will verify rumors of a potential buyout by larger company.

Stonk is up 15% in the last two weeks, and 50% off 52 week high
Market cap is 1.6 billion
Only 128 million shares outstanding
44% currently owned by institutions
Short interest just under 7% of the float

Unlike most other stonks on WSB, This company actually becomes more profitable as it spends more money. Yes, I'm looking at you UWMC. If they continue at this rate, they will be profitable before end of year. Check their earnings.

Now please rip this deep dive to shreds in the comments below. If you agree with any of it I will assume you are a Wall Street douchebag.

TL/DR: first FDA approved therapy for lupus has room to double, and not many shares outstanding.

At $65k/yr/patient in revenue they will need about 3000 patients to break even by then. In Q1 they were able to get 250 new patient signups, if they get 250 new patients each quarter and those patients use the drug for 3 years (FDA approval guidance was for 1 year!) they will NEVER make $50mm/qtr.

Bet is they will get MANY more patients than 250/qtr but that is much easier said than done and they will likely dilute shareholders bigly trying to do so."

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. Explosive fires have started everywhere already. Stock markets are on fire and so are property markets, as well as bond and debt markets. The problem is that fires are initially explosive but always end up implosive. 

How predictable events are (and people). This is particularly true in the world economy. Empires come and go, economies boom and bust and new currencies come and without fail always go. All this happens with regularity. 

&#x200B;

 Everything really on fire :

 We have seen  about inflation running wild and it is not just happening in stocks. Property markets are literarily exploding, especially the high end. We see this all over the world and not just in the US. In the UK for example, HSBC stated that March saw the highest number of mortgages EVER issued. In Sweden properties sell for up to 40% above asking price in a frenzied bidding war and second hand leisure boats are in such demand that they cost virtually the same as a new boat. And if you want a new boat, there is none available until 2022. It also seems that people are desperate for company after the lockdowns as prices for puppies in the UK are up to 100% higher than last year.

 Yes, everything is really on fire as people are desperate to just spend, spend, spend after a year of lockdowns and restrictions. 

 AN ECONOMIC BUBBLE OF AIR

 Since air is free, governments can produce unlimited amounts of it. And without exception, gullible people want to believe that it is actually real money and not just empty air. The beauty for the government is that they can just produce and borrow trillions of dollars at ZERO cost. And by manipulating interest rates they can borrow this money also at virtually ZERO cost. 

 So first the government manufactures the money at no cost and then they pay NOTHING for the privilege of borrowing that money. 

 The money obviously creates massive bubbles in stocks, bonds, houses, used cars , boats, puppies and other massively overvalued investments and consumer items. 

 Just look at how, for example, the Dow has gone up **exponentially and parabolically** **in the last year in an historically unprecedented straight line.** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lnjdj8xvlg071.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b514632f262f311d158e14416251b98f6d00e

 

**US Federal Debt up 74X**  
**Total US debt up “only” 49X**  
**M2 Money Supply up 29X>**

**Debt to GDP 1971: 37% – 2021: 127%**

 Bubbles are called bubbles because they consist of air. And when bubbles become too big, they ALWAYS and without fail burst and implode. 

 Technically markets are giving very clear signals that THE END IS NIGH.

Whether that means days weeks or a few months, is totally irrelevant. We know that we are at the end of the most remarkable period in history in regards to money, investments and the economy.

 GOLD, SILVER AND WEALTH PRESERVATION

Gold  and Silver  have not at all reflected the massive creation of money in the last 50 years. That catchup phase is likely to start very soon based on both fundamentals and technicals. 

As regards securing your finances in periods of crisis, gold and silver have always been critical to hold.

 Everyone can afford some gold or silver. An ounce of silver is $28 and one gramme of gold is $50. So saving in precious metals will not only be very useful but essential at whatever level you can afford.

 The upside potential for gold and silver is multiples of the current prices and that is at today’s price levels. Higher inflation could take the metals to unfathomable heights.

Let's play ""identify the quote bingo"" :

* ""Time in the market beats timing the market.""

* ""So-and-so has predicted 14 of the last 2 market crashes.""

* ""The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.""

Unless you believe capitalism writ-large is going to end within your lifetime, just buy index funds and go to sleep on them.

As soon as you go to cash or shiny metals, you've started down the path of the retired couple whose kids discover $200,000 cash stuffed in mattresses ""because they were afraid of the stock market.""

That $200,000 from 1980 [could have grown to $6,704,000 in 2021](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/), right through Black Monday 1987, the Dot-Com-Crash, the GFC and 2020's short-lived COVID crash.

Here’s another bingo quote for you:

* “Going back to 1930, if an investor missed the S&P 500′s 10 best days in each decade, total returns would be just 91%, significantly below the 14,962% return for investors who held steady through the downturns.”

If that’s not the final word on **staying invested**, I don’t know what is.

So I'm investing in companies involved in food production. After there's a big collapse in the market, the government will figure out how to keep food production working (probably subsidizing it or whatever) so my investment is safe. If the government doesn't figure out how to make food production work, I'll probably starve so my portfolio doesn't matter anymore, does it?"

2021-05-21 16:46:54,wallstreetbets,It would be foolish to invest your entire portfolio in precious metals or to hold gold indefinitely. But the risk of inflation right now is real and with interest rates already being so low a minor economic downturn could easily lead to stagflation. You'd expect gold to go up 2x during that time while everything else drops 30-40%. So you hold 5-15% of your portfolio in gold now and then when things get ugly turn it in to your favorite discounted stocks. Time tested strategy.

Is the stock market bottom or top of the wealth cycle? Is gold and silver at the bottom or top of the wealth cycle? To me the answer is obvious.

The only time precious metals are valuable is in a moderate financial downturn where people can cling to something with limited global inventory and hedge it against the decreasing value of the dollar.  

If there is a moderate crash where all your normal financial systems continue to exist you would have done better investing in a commodities market than physical assets that are difficult to trade at fair value.

2021-05-21 16:47:32,wallstreetbets,"Did you bother to finish reading his comment? Based on this comment, I'm starting to think you got halfway through then got so upset that you raced to the bottom to start replying. This was addressed.

You may also want to go look up what a factoid actually is before you keep using the term.

And I'm thinking it's less an issue of the quote being stupid and moreso that you can't understand it. It's often cited for a reason, and that reason isn't because you're actually just smarter than everybody else.

But hey, go ahead and miss out on exponential growth to avoid a few downturns. Even though it was just pointed out to you that taking those downturns just mathematically isn't worth missing out on the growth days, I'm sure you're just smarter than all those dumb people. Clearly *you're* going to be the one that can predict which days will be important before they happen.

Good luck."

At some point ""buy gold"" will be the right play. Is it right now? I don't know - haven't done my own DD yet because I've had my feet in other arenas

On the other hand, you're on WSBs my dude. People here want plays that will either go +1000% or higher or blow their account to smithereens (and the accompanying gain/loss porn). Safe plays ""buy metals"" is more acceptable in other finance subs."
2021-05-21 11:37:17,wallstreetbets,"More life experience =/= relevant life experience. Too many boomers think they're knowledgeable on things they're not just because they're old as fuck.

The current market environment is leaps and bounds different from 40 years ago and the generational gap can easily be observed by which investors have managed to capitalize - and a lot of older investors have notoriously turned their noses up to some of the most blatant moneymaking opportunities in the past decade. 

If an old dude wants to teach me how to fix a car because he was a mechanic for 2 decades in his prime, fire away my man, you could run circles around me. But I've had boomers try to tell me how my electronic equipment that I maintain for a living functions and be smug about it (they're always completely wrong by the way.

2021-05-21 18:59:47,wallstreetbets,Refinance now while rates are low. You want to have debt during inflation since it loses value. Your wages should hopefully increase and that will make it easier to pay off the debt. Although your purchasing power for goods and services will decrease.

2021-05-21 15:35:27,wallstreetbets,Ah good find. I agree that it's a bad way measure but OP has a story to sell.
2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Nokia succeeded in overtaking Huawei and Ericsson Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract. Ericsson, which previously led Nokia, has only received 138 global 5G commercial contracts. Huawei had won 91 global 5G contracts.

I suspect Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark. Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 – 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips. This lowers the total cost of ownership for wireless providers and it is a great selling point."

2021-05-21 11:35:41,wallstreetbets,"I always go back to Pekka’s comments from his last few presentations. It’s basically this, “Nokia has picked up roughly 50% of revenue on contracts that have changed hands in the last 3 years.”

Essentially, he’s saying that for every $1 in revenue Huawei loses because of all of the bans, Nokia is picking up .50 cents in revenue.

They demolished their previous earnings and there is a small rumor from a Finnish firm that they think Nokia will raise guidance in their next earnings. Their current guidance puts them around a $75B market cap company in 2023 if they received the same valuation the rest of the 5G market gets. So around ~3x from it’s current price."

Been reading about and following Nokia for a few weeks. Slowly increasing my quantity of held shares as well. 

Go, go cellular infrastructure improvements!"
2021-05-21 13:51:26,wallstreetbets,"Copy pasta my old comment:

""Nokia is only western company which offers complete end to end solutions. When huawei gets foothold positions in western telecom companies it pushes other industry to make own private networks. Whats the best place to buy your equipment for that? :) nokia has double digit grow for private networks.

Bonus thing is that there is major movement to stop huawei's western expansion. Very bullish for long term investment in nokia imho. (I have 1871 shares).""

Also nokia offers fastest inhouse switch fabric (FP4) and competitors have nothing to compete against that. Nokia is gaining market share from cisco etc. Because of this chip. Google ""Nokia and Elisa push network boundaries with world’s first 1T deployment"". Theres this line: ""Most networks are still operating a multitude of 100GE ports, with 400GE on the horizon. Nokia’s trial with Elisa is proving out terabit interfaces today.""

I personally work in telecom industry and I see Nokia as great investment for atleast next 10 years. It has been bashed for a reason before and because of that Nokia has negative weight of history. We can use that for our longterm gain."

2021-05-21 12:17:58,wallstreetbets,"I can try without it being too funky. The management program for programming Nokia equipment is a super nice GUI, and Ericsson’s is just a command line interface that is super annoying.

The Nokia stuff is generally easier to mount on the tower. Easier to program, easier to maintain. 

Speaking of actual specs Nokia is the winner. They’ve had 5G equipment for about 3 years now and we’ve been installing it since. It would run 4G back then and then all they had to do was a remote software update to use 5G as well as 4G. 

Then lastly Nokia has had these fiber optic ports called QSFP ports which run at 40GB/s and Ericsson and Huawei still run regular SFP ports which only run at 10GB. There’s a lot to the actual core data center side too which I’ve heard Nokia dominates but I really haven’t done too much data center stuff, just towers for the most part."

All these things fucked up people do to ""save money and get rich!"" These are normally the most desperate and depraved types...

 Moms tactic is baby daddies and child support payments. One more kid and she is ""set for life"" But I am not falling into the same cycles of addictions and abuse. Can't really get anywhere like that, especially in the modern era.  


When i was 16 I saved up 3000 for post secondary educations and stuff... You know, a future or something... Not even sure where that went towards now other then my moms pocket. I never got to go to college unfortunately...."

Only -philes care about best quality beyond an acceptable point. For everyone else there is always an appreciable trade off between cost/quality. If Nokia' can provide technology that over 5 - 10 years lowers costs then perhaps whatever additional one might pay for their equipment might make it an attractive purpose for companies over other providers such at Ericsson."

Great news! The landlord my wife and I rent from decided to sell so we’ve got to be out in July! Said I’d put an offer in. Listed for $430k (2 bed 2 bath condo). Sold for $500k, no subjects. 2 days on the market. We live in the greater Vancouver area, not even downtown. Got blown out of the water. 

Of course I could not offer any higher as my portfolio is down about 25% and no news or positive earning release seems to make anything pop these days. So fuck me. The first time home buyer incentive for up to $35k doesn’t do fuck all when you can’t access it in time to pay the deposit.

2021-05-21 06:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Futures are moving higher this morning, with the Dow and S&P up about 0.4%. Nasdaq is 0.2% higher. This follows a rebound yesterday when tech booked major gains (Nasdaq rallied 1.8% and is now on track to break a four-week losing streak).

Another post-pandemic low in initial jobless claims yesterday does appear to have helped. Goes to show that just when you don’t see any catalysts for a rally, investors come in and bid things up. This tends to happen in bull markets. We’re still in a bull market. Probably will be for a little while.

Today we have purchasing manager surveys out at 0945. . That’s it for economic data releases. No major earnings reports either. May be a quiet day. May see more buying, as tends to happen in bull markets. Oh wait, I already said that. 

Anyway, have a great weekend."

There isn’t any hard set rules. Average down, but also average up. Sell for gains, but also sell for losses. Make the best decisions possible with the information you have that day with the overriding question being what will be the best return for me personally from this day forward.

The table is huge and so much food out there. So much that there is room for all of us to have a seat and feast.

Stay positive and don’t let the negative people suck the life force out of you.

Good luck.

Anywho, enjoy.

Credit goes to u/TheYoungPaulBlart for a gift from OG WSB I found in my saved posts. It seems relevant in these dire times:

Stocks only go up


*This economic data looks grim,* I think to myself. *This is the right move.* I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.

I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.

I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. ""What am I-"" 

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he asks.

""Huh?"" I respond, confused.

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he demands, louder this time.

""I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-"" **WHAM!** One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.

""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short the domestic market?""

Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&P has climbed back to 2850. *Impossible*, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!"" I manage to answer. **WHAM!** Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.

""Repeat after me: stocks only go up,"" Powell demands.

I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary *guh* escapes my mouth as it falls agape.

Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?""

I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.

""Stocks only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.

The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.

""Stocks only go up,"" I say."

PLTR at 28? Just let it go. GME at 220? Free yourself from this burden. TSLA at 800? It will be okay. PSFE at 16, or CLOV at 12? You can do this guys. It’s never too late to make the right choice."

The availability of the ""commerical"" model will likely be late 2022. It will be insanely disappointing, and it will become more and more evident that the entire Lightning presentation was solely to try to retain shareholder confidence. Ford will be lucky to produce and sell more than 20k Lightnings next year. They will perform poorly. The EV hype for Ford will fade. Ford will drown in crippling debt.

You heard it here first.

!RemindMe 1 year

E: best case scenario, Ford cannibalizes it's F150 ICE sales with the Lightning that they sell for thin margins or even a loss. They still drown in their debt."

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Thoughts on $SPCE puts vs call/put spreads for launch tomorrow? Virgin Galactic announced they have a test flight scheduled for tomorrow and the stock moved up by 14% yesterday. I’m overall bearish on this company, as founder Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares. Cathie Woods doesn’t even own it for ARK. 

I want to buy puts in anticipation of a drop Monday, this seems like the most likely outcome to me. Whether the launch is a failure or people just sell the news after a big move, it seems unlikely that it continues to rally Monday. There’s a lot of bag holders who bought at $40-60 a couple months ago that would love to get out if it bounces which would theoretically limit its possible gains Monday. On the chance the test flight greatly exceeds expectations or there is another announcement included along side the test, the stock could fly however. I feel that this is a slim but non-zero possibility. Basically whichever way it moves, it’s going to move hard. June 4th options have an IV of 165% per thinkorswim. 

My question is whether I am better off buying straight puts on $SPCE or if I should buy some sort of call/put spread to hedge my downside in the event the stock continues to fly Monday. My main concern is making the right move and still getting IV crushed. I’m looking at 6/4/21 $20 puts, or a spread at the same strike and expiry. In your opinions, is that a smart move or is there something else I should be considering? I’m still relatively new to trading options. 

Thanks for your input!

(I have no positions in $SPCE at the time of posting, I will update if I enter any contracts)"
2021-05-21 06:06:06,wallstreetbets,"FYI Virgin Group / Branson is still SPCE’s largest shareholder w/ 24% ownership. He sold a portion, nowhere near all, as he secured billions in covid rescue packages for his airlines / hotels. 

Look at the docs don’t just read the headlines.

2021-05-21 06:09:21,wallstreetbets,I'm holding a strangle. Believe it could go either way. Hopefully will go hard both ways
2021-05-21 08:36:39,wallstreetbets,#here is my honest opinion: it could go tits up or tits down
2021-05-21 07:22:01,wallstreetbets,Be careful with puts. If they are successful it may go back to $60. This is financial advice.
2021-05-21 07:32:35,wallstreetbets,You lost me at 'Richard Branson and SPAC-backer Chamath Palihapitiya have both sold basically all of their shares'
2021-05-21 07:54:33,wallstreetbets,"I honestly wouldn’t touch puts for this. Hear me out, if they end up complete if a successful test flight this weekend (which is highly likely all things considered) they will then be in uncharted territory. They will then finally be a company with a proof of concept and investors will have much more confidence. They also have two more test flights planned for this summer (the last one being the Branson flight and final flight prior to full on commercialization). Basically what I’m saying is, on Monday, it is possible this could shoot right back up to $60 like it was a couple months ago. There will definitely be some sell off but how big of one? No one really knows."

2021-05-21 10:07:10,wallstreetbets,"The continued bearish sentiment against spce is just going to contribute further to a wild spike if they execute this weekend.

2021-05-21 08:07:08,wallstreetbets,"That’s fair. I don’t think it will hit $60 again anytime soon, but it could definitely bounce Monday. Unless it moves up another ~10% today I think I’ll hold off on outs though. I do think there will be a sell the news event sometime Monday, regardless of what happens, so I may wait to buy puts till then"

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"FORD DD - $F - Don't worry about debt Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.

**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    
**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**

While Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**

In other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.

In short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.

Additionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.

At this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.

Therefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.

From old post:

1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.
2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.
3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.
4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.
5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.
6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.
7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.

The 21 F-150 is impossible to keep on the lot and I’m probably sold out for the first two years of Broncos. Might already have my first year of lightnings sold as well. Even Bronco Sports are sold before they arrive. Mach E hasn’t really taken off yet but I think when BlueCruise comes out that’ll get better. On the flip side I have maybe 20 new cars in stock instead of my usual 100-150, but as far as Ford is concerned those cars are sold the minute we order them, and they collect interest through floor plan until we sell it to a customer. And brand loyalty is huge with Ford, I still get customers who only buy Ford because “they didn’t take the bailout in 2008”.

2021-05-21 11:03:53,wallstreetbets,"So a Ford buyer moves from a high production, high margin ICE F150 to a BEV F150 that has zero to negative margin due to up front costs and development.

How is this a positive?   They are losing on 2 fronts.  The high margin market it shrinking due to their own success (and other entrants) and the EV's won't show profit if they can't scale, which they have no capacity to produce.  

They are entering the EV market with no advantages.  No battery cost advantage, no pricing advantage, no performance advantage, no charging advantage, no production cost advantage.

Go on Autotrader and look at all the Mach-E's available.  Hundreds in my area.  They aren't selling out, because Mustang buyers buy V8 Mustangs.   If they buy the EV version, that's bad for the ICE sales and bad for profits because it's less profit, not more."
2021-05-21 12:44:27,wallstreetbets,"Ford commercial sales here. Commodity constraints are crushing ford right now and are expected to significantly impact production through next year. 
Its not just semiconductors either. Dumb shit like spray in bedliners and rims are hard to get. 

The electric transit will be a flop. It serves a very niche market and not 1 business owner i talked to would buy an electric f150 or transit. Look at the diesel F150. Everybody raved about it now no one wants them or even stocks them. Diesel F150s are super bagholders. 

Mach E straight up sucks for dealers. MSRP and invoice are the same. Dealers must jump through hoops to earn profit on them. Salespeople are getting paid $100 flats for selling them which is destroying motivation. This new pricing structure is expected to continue with all elecrric vehicles moving forward.

Even in my more rural area Teslas have nearly lost their ""automatic cool"" status. They are still ranked alongside BMW, Caddy, etc but just being a Tesla is no longer enough. I know Tesla seems massive but compared to the reach, resources, and connections of a GM/Ford/Fiat Chrysler.... Not so much.

2021-05-21 09:52:33,wallstreetbets,"The dirty secret with EV's is that it takes nat gas and coal to produce electricity, not to mention the elements that need to be mined for batteries. It takes 7 years currently to break even on carbon emissions with an ev vs. A combustion car. Solar isn't enough for power and we don't currently have the grid to support it.

The problem is every other manufacturer across the globe needs the same batteries to succeed. They can make the best EV cars and trucks known to man, but if they cannot find enough cells they are just pet projects. Their partnership with SK gives them about 60K Lightnings/year initially, then about 125K in 2024. This is not enough.....

I feel like they are more focused on their shift to EV's than GM/Stellantis, which is great and I am rooting for them. GM puts out the Hummer which is $120K and high fives on a job well done....Not near good enough to be serious. I hope their actual trucks are a real effort."

They are battery technology is going to be able to revolutionize the energy industry and even while the car manufacturing numbers explode upward or for the next decade, the auto percentage of revenue will continue to decrease.

Next thing, if you believe in full self driving, the last year has increase the probability the Tesla is the only company that is going to solve it. And they are getting very close. Feel free to harass me about it but we really should postpone any discussion on this until July.

Last thing, within three years. Driving will come to fruition and the model two will be released, tesla will become the biggest company United States, and then take the state of the art engineers that it has and start expanding into boats and, depending on battery technology, some sort of aerial transportation possibly."
2021-05-21 13:17:06,wallstreetbets,"1) To believe that in approximately 3 years Tesla will become the largest company in the U.S. is the exact pie-in-the-sky nonsense that one must believe to justify a 580PE. “Aerial transportation possibly”, I mean you’re literally just making stuff up because it sounds good. 
2) You really need to understand what a P/E of 1200, or even 580 for that matter, means. If you look at the numbers Tesla simply isn’t that profitable of a company compared to its peers. It is not reasonable that overnight this technology that hasn’t been super profitable yet will miraculously increase they’re earnings 500x or 1000x. 
3) You should brush up on history of booms like Tesla. I don’t know why you would have “infinite comfort” if you knew anything about the 90s dot coms, the 80s growth stocks, the 60s tronics boom, 18th century south sea company, Mississippi trading company, etc. The current valuation of Tesla is simply not sustainable. You should be able to like a company and still recognize when it is overvalued."
2021-05-21 13:23:19,wallstreetbets,"1. I’m being careful with my word and because there is a chance that they don’t end up pursuing aviation. There is also a chance they end up trying to pursue smaller jets rather than go in commercial. Lots of possibilities. Then you also have other companies in the same space seeking a quad copter approach towards regional transportation, like 4 to 500 miles. But this is not what the valuation stems from, I am just speaking in the very long term

2. You do realize that the biggest companies on the NASDAQ all at times had similar ratios? Go look at what Amazons was. Pointing to a high ratio is like the dumbest fucking argument because it completely ignores the fact that skyhigh ratios exist for a reason. Expectations of growth. What do you think will happen to the ratio when Austin and Berlin are both fully online? 

3. Just because you can refer past bubbles doesn’t mean that this is a bubble.

Let me leave you with one final thought. When you look at the cost per car, most of that is due to battery costs. Tesla has battery technology they will provide higher power output and density per dollar than its competitors in a huge way. Then, on top of that, you take into account the economies of scale they are going to achieve, and low cost they are going to achieve with the casting machines. What you get is a car body that is cheaper then the competitors, with battery technology that can provide the same range, acceleration, and longevity for a far cheaper price. Add to that the insurance angle and you have a total car that can be produced far more cheaply than anyone else, the profit margin‘s will be very high. 

And this ignores the energy sector, this ignores the software angle. This ignores the fact that dojo will soon be the most powerful dumb AI in the world for creating dumb AI solutions to other things. This ignores the fact that tesla can play it’s engineer and and battery advantages into many more fields."
2021-05-21 13:35:36,wallstreetbets,"1) Again with these “possibilities”. You can’t take “possibilities” to the bank. All of that is simply over optimistic talk about what “could” happen. Talk of “possibilities” would not give me “infinite comfort”.

2) Amazon was a true success story. But let me ask you, for every Amazon how many other tech companies went bankrupt? A lot, and so just pointing out that a few other companies that started with high P/E’s had success does not mean jack. Hoping Tesla is the next Amazon would not give me “infinite comfort”.

3) You’re right, just because there have been many similar bubble is the past does not make Tesla a bubble. But on the flip side what you’re failing to recognize is that it very well could mean that, and there is a trail in history to support that possibility. Just by looking at history I would not have “infinite comfort”

I think you’re missing the point of this whole argument we’re having and why it started. I’m simply making the point that you are over confident and overly optimistic about Tesla’s future. Maybe one day they will have earnings to justify their valuation, but that day has not happened yet and anyone who “guarantees” that it will happen is just talking with nothing tangible to back it up."
2021-05-21 13:37:27,wallstreetbets,"Just give it all to Berkshire and be done with it, leave WSB lmao. If you don’t have the stomach for discussing unknowns and basing In argument off of reasonable assertions of the future then you don’t belong here"
2021-05-21 13:36:35,wallstreetbets,Do you not realize that high growth companies with high ratios are inherently built on possibility? If you want a guarantee with rock solid evidence and no risk then go back to value investing.
2021-05-21 13:48:27,wallstreetbets,"Let me try to make this very simple because you seem to still be missing the entire point of this argument. 

“Unknowns” and “Reasonable assumptions” are NOT the same thing as “infinite comfort”"
2021-05-21 13:40:48,wallstreetbets,Please re-read what you just typed. You literally just argued my entire point for me. I said you should not have “infinite comfort”. You just said Tesla is not “a guarantee with rock solid evidence”. So then you agree “infinite comfort” might be a little bit of an exaggeration?
2021-05-21 13:50:42,wallstreetbets,"I understand what you’re trying to say. I should clarify my original point. To you these are possibilities, to you these are unknowns. I have vastly higher confidence in the positive end of the scenario list than you do

How long have you been tracking Tesla? The challenges that they face today are nothing compared to what they faced in 2017 and 2018. This is like mopping up an army that is already broken. For Tesla to realize the most positive ends of the most hyperbolic scenarios all they have to do is cover their bases rather than reinvent the wheels and break massive barriers like they had to years ago"
2021-05-21 13:53:11,wallstreetbets,"Essentially, a high PE ratio just reflects the lag time that it takes institutional investors to realize where things are going — that alone isn’t proof of “nobody knows”. Sometimes the market is wrong. Information is in perfect, people are overly cautious. In the long term things are competitively priced so feel free to drop a remindme on me"
2021-05-21 19:09:52,wallstreetbets,"Lol your second paragraph is backwards af for auto.  The bigger they get the harder it will be to control costs, match supply to demand, and remain competitive.  You speak of their multiple when their new plants come online - since their car operations lose money it ought to not be a positive catalyst; but knowing the cult and the incestuous relations Tesla has with Wall Street banks I’m sure it will be bullish as ever."
2021-05-21 13:58:52,wallstreetbets,I understand that. But I don’t think you realize what an incredible P/E 580 is (not even to mention 1200+). So you think that in the near future that Tesla can go from a company making 31 Billion in revenue annually to 18 TRILLION in annual revenue? Are you serious? You think that in just a few short years that Tesla will have more annual revenue than the entire GDP of China and nearly equivalent to the current US GDP???

2021-05-21 14:30:38,wallstreetbets,thanks for the laughs guys
2021-05-21 14:02:54,wallstreetbets,"??? Lol..... If annual revenue goes from 31,000,000,000 to 18,000,000,000,000, that’s a 580x multiple of earnings. Dude where are you getting your numbers?? 

Go redo your calculation and assume Tesla increases revenue by 10x by 2030"
2021-05-21 14:06:16,wallstreetbets,Like where in the hell are you getting 10x from? Is that your own prediction? Because if so then you 100% must agree that the current valuation is extremely overvalued and not at all justified??
2021-05-21 19:29:52,wallstreetbets,"I can’t get over how foolish you made yourself look, “DuDe WhErE aRe YoU gEtTiNg YoUr NuMbErS?” 😂😂. I can’t even comprehend how you thought Tesla’s P/E of 580 (or 1200+ not long ago) translated to 10x earnings😂😂😂"
2021-05-21 14:04:53,wallstreetbets,Yeah no shit it’s a 580 multiple??? Please tell me you do understand that a Price/Earnings ratio of 580 means that that current stock price of Tesla is pricing in 580x the current earnings of the company... you do understand this right?
2021-05-21 14:06:15,wallstreetbets,"Your math is wrong. 580x is 580,000%. Seriously, like I’m not trying to be a dick here but you’re out of your fucking mind if you think that the market is pricing Tesla as having a future revenue estimation of 18 trillion."
2021-05-21 14:16:36,wallstreetbets,"For example just to help you understand this, a company with a P/E of 20 means that an investor is willing to pay $20 for every $1 a company earns. So for this company to be valued fairly, the company would have to start earning $20. In the case of Tesla, investors are willing to pay $580 for every $1 of earnings. Well, they have 31B in earnings. So for Tesla to be valued fairly, they should be expected to have earnings of (31B x 580) a.k.a. 18 Trillion. I hope you just realized how foolish you are!"
2021-05-21 14:11:02,wallstreetbets,"First of all that’s not how math works, 580x is 58,000% not 580,000%. Second, I really think you should look up how a P/E ratio is calculated because I think you finally just realized how incredibly ridiculous Tesla’s valuation is"
2021-05-21 14:18:10,wallstreetbets,"Your math is wrong. 580x is 58,000%. Seriously, like I’m not trying to be a dick here but you’re out of your fucking mind if you think that the market is pricing Tesla as having a future revenue estimation of 18 trillion."

2021-05-21 14:18:10,wallstreetbets,So the math checks out then? 😂🤡
2021-05-21 14:21:08,wallstreetbets,"Like hang on a second I really need to understand your position now. Your previous comment said I was “seriously out of my mind” if I thought that Tesla is valued with future earnings of 18 Trillion, but now that my math has checked out wouldn’t that make YOU “seriously out of your mind”?????😂🤡🤡🤡"
2021-05-21 14:17:52,wallstreetbets,"Wait so since you didn’t have any real comeback to how math works, are you conceding that I was correct? You don’t have anything else to say about Tesla’s valuation?"
2021-05-21 14:20:16,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you’re totally right. 

Please please be a fucking man and put your money where your mouth is. How about some 2023 $100 puts?"

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Vizio: A Macroeconomic perspective  

Inflation is gonna destroy non-asset holders. I’m a bit worried about discount retail (5 below, DG, Dollar Tree) holding up because the business models are predicated on selling commodities at a certain price point. If commodity prices skyrocket dollar tree especially is gonna have a tough time adjusting since literally everything in their store is a dollar. So I think the better bet is to buy the actual companies that create goods that the poor are capable of buying (since inflation will eradicate much of the middle class.) Vizio products would never be sold in one of these stores but they sell really cheap TVs with internet accessibility. They sell a really good product considering the price point. I check their books and it’s a profitable company that’s been improving margins that last two years. Pretty low market cap so I wouldn’t be shocked if a larger company sought to buy it in the future. Worth ripping OTM yolos for the next two years"
2021-05-21 02:52:30,wallstreetbets,You've got me lolling at the idea of the two dollar tree. The dollarish store. The dollar generally speaking adjusted for inflation. It'll be pretty easy to change those signs.

Inflation was actually close to 10% for much of the 80-90s, and we didn’t die. Plus, it is a very tightly controlled parameter which obviously will get lowered by rising interest rates (which will fuck the growth stocks but whatever).

Stop saying that inflation is gonna end the world, it’s stupid."

2021-05-21 02:55:50,wallstreetbets,">it is a very tightly controlled parameter

You should probably not pretend to know what you're talking about on this one. It's mostly at the whim of the economy in general and the only input that anyone controls is the supply of money. And the knee jerk reaction to it that politicians always try is to print their way out of it. It's happened over and over again. It is controllable, but it is not controlled. Whenever a leader need to buy votes that's where you'll find inflation."
2021-05-21 12:08:49,wallstreetbets,Highest Core CPI increase in a quarter in the last 40 years. Biden is going to feel political pressure from his voting base to continue the handouts. Those who are too poor to own assets (the middle class typically only has a home ... little equity) are going to see the buying power of the dollar shrink without any substantial wage increases.
2021-05-21 02:56:10,wallstreetbets,"High interest rates = harder to borrow money. 

Growth stocks are the ones that need to borrow money the most (obviously to “grow”), since they usually don’t even have any revenue and just a huge amount of debt.

That’s why these previous months have been so good for them, because o% interest rate basically means “infinite money” for these stocks and they can keep burning cash and trying to expand and grow... but when this free money ends, they are a bit fucked. That’s why you see huge crashes in the growth sector whenever rumors of inflation come up etc."
2021-05-21 02:59:13,wallstreetbets,"The cost of money. Our interest rates have been at historic lows since the whole 2008 thing. That's allowed business to borrow money to create products and has supercharged the economy. Eventually the shit hits the fan though when there's too much debt to be paid back easily, at that point the fed needs to raise the rates making it harder for those growth companies to justify borrowing money to raise funds to produce new products or expand their production."
2021-05-21 02:57:54,wallstreetbets,"Lmao are you retarded? The governments usually aim for a 2% inflation increase every year, and they will definitely increase interest rates and make almost everything for it to not surpass that.

the 2-3 percent fluctations were not ""crashes."" Unlike popular wsb hysteria, markets do not just climb in a straight line. they actually fluctuate  from time to time. blowing off a few percentage points is a healthy and normal behavior.

but like i said, a QQQ P100 implies a 70% drop. No interest rate bump is going to melt 70% of the US economy. 10% maybe. 20% maybe.

It literally was when first introduced. There was a speech about it

> In my Inaugural I laid down the simple proposition that nobody is going to starve in this country. It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By ""business"" I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living.

FDR on the act that introduced the minimum wage."
2021-05-21 05:32:03,wallstreetbets,"Sure, the purpose of minimum wage might be able to support your family back in 1933 when inflation is at -5.11%, but it is not feasible in the market when inflation is at +4.16%, a dollar in the past is 20 bucks in todays world. when minimum wage was first introduced at $.25 and eventually to $5.15. I personally believe its the prices of the goods that are too expensive and I do not believe that we had found an equilibrium between price/minimum wage. The increase of wages will not help anyone as it will just trickle down to most corporates bottom line and you know the boards are not willing to take less so they'll just push it to the consumer which repeats the cycle."
2021-05-21 10:47:59,wallstreetbets,The profit margins could go down instead of up and the balance could be used to pay workers and keep cost of goods the same.
2021-05-21 12:37:22,wallstreetbets,"I was responding your earlier assertion that minimum wage wasn't meant to support a family in the US. This is a persistent myth. It absolutely was. On your point about inflation, though

>It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for   
existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right   
to continue in this country. 

This should not be arguable - if your workers qualify for social assistance then you're a *cost* to the economy, not a benefit, and should close (or at least be on the hook for that social assistance). It's a direct cost to you as a consumer that happens every day - you are directly subsidizing these companies and their behaviour.

>The increase of wages will not help anyone as it will just trickle down   
to most corporates bottom line and you know the boards are not willing   
to take less so they'll just push it to the consumer which repeats the   
cycle.

Your point here is that companies will raise the prices, but there is still competition; the often quoted statistic is the price of a big mac in Denmark, where the wages and taxes are significantly higher (It's $4.87 in Denmark and $5.66 on average in the US, incidentally). Unless literally everywhere raises their prices at the same time, anyone who does will be at a competitive disadvantage. In reality, prices would rise a bit and settle into a new equilibrium.

The health of the economy is based around the velocity of money. Every dollar that goes to someone who will spend it is worth far more than one that's sitting in a bank account somewhere. Raising the minimum wage will do way more for the US economy than giving companies billions in tax breaks."

Currently BIGC is trading at 17x revenue and I think that a fair value for this stock is 20 to 40x revenue (especially since it will be compared with Shopify). Average growth the past few years per quarter is around 8.4% per quarter.

Currently the stock is down this year trading around $50, peak was $140 last year.

Projecting out growth over 5 years shows that:

1. 2021: Revenue $211M, stock $60 to $120
2. 2022: Revenue $292M, stock $83 to $166
3. 2023: Revenue $403M, stock $114 to $230
4. 2024: Revenue $556M, stock $158 to $316
5. 2025: Revenue $768M, stock $218 to $437
6. 2026: Revenue $1B, stock $302 to $604

Personally I think that as the company continues to show strong growth the share price will grow overvalued in the short term (before EOY). I do think the stock will be a 5 to 10x bagger in the next five years though. They may also be able to hit $1B in revenue sooner than 2026.

TLDR; BIGC good, like SHOP, but undervalued.

Position: 2000 shares @ $55

they burned 30 mill of 190m cash last quarter. so along with these increasing revenues, they've managed wider net losses every quarter. So they've essentially let costs skyrocket to acquire more revenue. 

You've got 1-1.5 years before they run out of cash, meaning either dilution or debt facilities, and there looks to be plenty of room for a 50 dollar stock to get diluted.

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Youtube just updated their terms to put ads on every channel, regardless if they are part of youtube's partner program which requires 1k subscribers and 4000 watch hours. This happened roughly 4 hours ago from making this post and the new terms go into effect June 1st. 

I really think this is huge for GOOG/GOOGL ad revenue. According to socialblade, there are 56 million channels under 1k subs(10-999) as of November 13 2020. Youtube previously demonetized smaller channels but I guess is going all in.

From Youtube: ""YouTube’s right to monetize: YouTube has the right to monetize all content on the platform and ads may appear on videos from channels not in the YouTube Partner Program.""

With GOOG's stock rising $600 EPS over the past 6 months and with this, I almost see nothing that can stop tremendous ad revenue and a moderate EPS during Q3 earnings call."

2021-05-21 05:27:02,wallstreetbets,YouTube has become a site for ads with videos in between them.

I can hardly remember a single youtube ad I was interested in or remember. the ones I liked I don’t know what they were selling, and the ones I do remember, i hate (I’ll never buy axe body spray, shampoo or any of that shit)

Edit: i love all the defensive marketers telling me how critical youtube ads are to the function of the entire world 🙄, keep the justifications coming. No one gives a shit about your ads"
2021-05-20 23:48:02,wallstreetbets,Google is going anywhere and everywhere for more revenue while cutting costs. Its weird.
2021-05-20 23:47:40,wallstreetbets,"I can’t stand youtube now. I avoid it as much as possible, and if I am forced to see an ad I develop a hatred of those who worked so hard to destroy what used to be a wonderful service."
2021-05-21 00:51:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that’s nice and all, but they won’t give any ad revenue to the person who makes the video at all. Win loss but guess it may go in favor for Google"
2021-05-21 00:42:30,wallstreetbets,"I'm guessing they won't go all in right away but just focus on higher traffic creators or specific categories to link ads to. As much as I hate to give them money, I pay for YT Premium because they are so ad heavy already on monetized channels...anyone ever get a 2 hour seminar ad in the middle of a 20 minute video but you're not near your phone to skip it? Wtf is that shit?
Same road I went down with Pandora Premium because I got tired of the Kia, Accident Law, and Keiser University commercials blasting because I like my music loud. YT knows everything you do but they haven't quite figured out the algorithm yet. Just because I like watching car content doesn't mean I want to throw away my career to go to Mechanic school....
That being said, Youtube will probably kill itself off sooner than later if they keep selectively enforcing the community guidelines, killing channels with millions of subscribers and forcing people to watch ads on channels that aren't monetized. Widespread ads seems more like an austerity measure than for additional revenue."
2021-05-21 01:50:48,wallstreetbets,"I struggle with YT these days. I wanna watch, but the ads kill me. 

They couldn’t leave well enough alone. I could tolerate the occasional advertisement, but they have kicked that bull in the nuts and let it run. 

The “content creators” are equally to blame. They bow down to YT and comply. Ever wonder why every influencer’s video is just over 10 minutes?

Sorry. Old guy/boomer signing off."

Use YouTube vanced

It’s not just a sense of stubborn principle; on YouTube I feel genuinely alienated, a very real sense of not belonging there; the content is not for me, it’s for algorithms. Also, browsing the site simply leaves me in a bad mood. So, like Facebook, I abandoned it. In its current form, it’s a bad product destined for failure.

I think a lot of advertising companies and organizations just do not want negative associations with their products and will do anything to avoid them. However, someone honestly reviewing a product or service and giving a real review is worth so much more than a stupid advertisement. I have purchased things in the past knowing that the product has specific issues or shortcomings, but I'd rather know what the limitations or issues of a product are before I buy it rather than discovering them through use."

2021-05-21 14:44:42,wallstreetbets,People who use NoScript and uBlock origin.
2021-05-20 23:46:12,wallstreetbets,"Not only the 'skip' and 'ignored part but alot of people like myself, when a video we are watching gets interrupted with an ad, it immediately makes me dislike that product and that dislike compounds until I avoid it at all costs"
2021-05-21 00:23:48,wallstreetbets,Most of them are some asshole who slapped together a shitty make money from home course
2021-05-20 23:45:44,wallstreetbets,"Almost every product (unless I NEED it) that has an ad during YT, I boycott"
2021-05-21 06:47:07,wallstreetbets,Have you heard about raid shadow legends?
2021-05-21 05:57:10,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, who needs branded soap and shampoo? I only wash with soap I make myself from human fat that I pull from dumpsters at liposuction clinics."
2021-05-21 00:19:21,wallstreetbets,Ads need a little curiosity to keep people engaged perhaps.   The claymation surgeon simulator ad was a good example of that
2021-05-21 02:43:24,wallstreetbets,Youtube ads are useless i always skip them and forget instantly.
2021-05-21 08:28:01,wallstreetbets,YouTube ads are exactly why I hate fucking webull ugh their ads are obnoxious as fuck.
2021-05-21 09:06:57,wallstreetbets,"I know that I will never use Grammarly because they seemingly bought all youtube ad space last summer and my work computer couldnt have adblock.  Idk if their service is good, but jeez I cant hear the company name without thinking about how annoying that was."
2021-05-21 02:32:33,wallstreetbets,Go ahead! Skip this ad! Just like you skipped on buying oh look 5 seconds is over.
2021-05-21 05:59:46,wallstreetbets,If I can't skip the ad I usually have YouTube minimized and I'm working on things until the ad is done.
2021-05-21 06:05:24,wallstreetbets,Agree. Youtube ads are always for useless products.
2021-05-21 07:07:34,wallstreetbets,I go out of my way not to buy the product its annoying as heck
2021-05-20 23:47:09,wallstreetbets,"I see more and more ads putting in 5 second ads like with snapchat that you cannot skip and if advertisers are smart they'll do just that. But they also pay Google less if a user skips the ad, but I am pretty sure(my opinion) at least 90% of non premium users skip ads and maybe with this influx, many more might start going youtube red which will increase revenue even more imo"
2021-05-21 06:39:36,wallstreetbets,I remember this protein powder this jacked Asian dude was flogging off. I had zero interest in buying it but God damn did I watch his 10 min ads. I dont even know why.
2021-05-21 11:29:30,wallstreetbets,How do you people not have ad blocker? I haven't seen a YouTube ad since 2012.
2021-05-21 00:34:50,wallstreetbets,"Are you trying to outsmart an ad agency data science team?

I wish you luck."
2021-05-21 04:26:31,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you understand advertising on YouTube. As an advertiser, it doesn't really matter if you forget their ad, their brand will still be in your subconscious when a purchasing decision is required for that product.

There's so little understanding of advertising on Reddit, and the people who say ""I'm not impacted by advertising"" are just as likely to purchase a product if the campaign is good.

For Axe, you're probably not the actual target audience anyway as their brand is polarising, Unilever don't care if you don't buy their product. It will still be the top of mind deodorant for most men in their teens/twenties though."
2021-05-20 23:48:06,wallstreetbets,Ads are just extortion to get Premium. I paid up the instant I found out there were no ads.
2021-05-21 05:43:51,wallstreetbets,">I can hardly remember a single youtube ad I was interested in or remember.

I'm no marketing wiz, but I don't think it matters all that much whether you remember the ad or not - it's about imprinting the brand name into your memory. And it certainly did do that.

>(I’ll never buy axe body spray, shampoo or any of that shit)

No advertisement is expected to reach 100% of the audience, and I bet the reason you aren't buying Axe products isn't *because* of the ads, it's because they're disgusting products that is mostly aimed at 13-14 year olds."
2021-05-21 15:59:01,wallstreetbets,You didn't invest in tai lopez's wealth creation program!!????
2021-05-21 06:20:31,wallstreetbets,"You know Axe exists and that it is a body spray. You even posted it on the internet to spread the word.

Means their advertising pretty much fulfilled its purpose. Of course this is more likely from TV commercials but same principle."
2021-05-21 10:18:27,wallstreetbets,"That's just bad marketing. Agencies and marketing pods not setting their backend targeting correctly. If you don't know what they're selling, that's creative doing a poor job of communicating the product. 

The fact that you remember any of them is a win, regardless what you feel. Let me tell you, and others in this thread, marketing and ads are more popular than ever and work better than ever. Plenty of people are engaging with them."
2021-05-21 16:25:53,wallstreetbets,if this were true the ad business would not be growing at the pace that it is
2021-05-21 17:17:35,wallstreetbets,"Someone go tell advertising for the last 40 years they are wrong. 

You have to not play annoying commercials. In fact, no commercials at all so people don’t take a personal boycott against your company for taking up their precious 5 seconds of time before they enjoy their paid or subsidized content."

2021-05-21 07:56:41,wallstreetbets,Google products used to be fun and enjoyable to use but now is just straight up suffering
2021-05-21 00:01:09,wallstreetbets,"Companies have caught up to them, I see them losing market share slowly but surely.  This is the cycle for all things that have advertising as their backbone."
2021-05-21 11:10:35,wallstreetbets,"A company that keeps trying to make money. Yes, this is exceptionally bizarre behavior for a business."
2021-05-21 01:51:19,wallstreetbets,Just use an ad blocker or Vanced Youtube.
2021-05-20 23:49:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah rip old youtube really. But even if you or I won't use it, the billion + active youtube users will still watch, and get revenue from those 56 million channels that were previously off the table."

Those people should invest in GME to make money instead of LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE REALLY HELP US OUT all and every day"
2021-05-21 13:55:34,wallstreetbets,"Ad blockers have been an essential part of online life for at least 15 years by now. You have no excuse to not have it, your age should make it more likely, not less. Install ublock origin and be done with it, as you should have in 2006"
2021-05-20 23:52:41,wallstreetbets,"Also you can just skip to the end of the video really quick, replay it, and no ads."
2021-05-21 00:26:59,wallstreetbets,"Can I log in with my Google account to have all my playlist functionality? If so, does that give the Vanced dev access to my Google login info?"
2021-05-21 04:19:20,wallstreetbets,"great recommendation thanks!
just sadly doesn't work well on Tablets if you want to search for videos since its locked to vertical and scales everything up so you can only see 2 videos before you have to scroll."
2021-05-21 13:21:19,wallstreetbets,"If it's inefficient - go to advertisers right now, tell them they're wasting money! They'll reward you greatly for your analysis and saving them billions of dollars!"
2021-05-21 06:01:05,wallstreetbets,Also Vivaldi
2021-05-21 13:17:54,wallstreetbets,"Not gonna try to sound like a skeptic, but if adblocking becomes more popular and a serious threat to google's revenue they're probably going to make steps necessary to make sure it dies completely. So staying within gray area of ""minority uses adblock"" is the best."
2021-05-21 00:20:04,wallstreetbets,"psst, don't tell em, who is gonna play ""Raid: Shadow Legend"" if everyone uses Ad Block?"
2021-05-21 13:24:27,wallstreetbets,Adblocker only works if minority uses it. You don't want to know what will happen to it if majority starts to use it.
2021-05-21 01:15:41,wallstreetbets,Who exactly do you think is paying for the free service you're getting?
2021-05-21 01:35:51,wallstreetbets,Reminds me of the Black Mirror episode where the ad paused when the character looked away.
2021-05-21 07:13:50,wallstreetbets,"Into the memory hole, bring in the ads for beheadings and heinous acts of violence"
2021-05-21 00:26:52,wallstreetbets,And you know they were planning it since they made partnership requirements unattainable for 98% of content creators
2021-05-21 01:33:32,wallstreetbets,I mean it's not like Youtube isn't doing anything.  Hardware costs and bandwidth for instance.   Not to mention the behind the scenes stuff.
2021-05-21 01:34:40,wallstreetbets,Stupid take. You use Google’s servers and bandwidth by posting videos on YouTube.
2021-05-21 06:21:22,wallstreetbets,"This is kind of a weird take.

Do you say the same thing about Reddit? That they're making money by showing ads while profiting by using your comments as content?

Don't forget, the fact that YouTube even *started* sharing ad revenue with uploaders way back when was a pretty big deal. It was just a video sharing site before that, like imgur is to images or Reddit is to links/posts."
2021-05-20 23:55:36,wallstreetbets,"Its only a matter of time before they sell ads cheap to ""demonetized"" videos. Anything to scrape for change, they'll do.
Edit: spelling"
2021-05-21 03:44:18,wallstreetbets,the site has never made a profit ever.
2021-05-21 00:28:30,wallstreetbets,A good little extra DD would be to figure out what % of video hits are to partnered channels vs. not partnered channels. That would tell you a lot about how much revenue to expect
2021-05-21 00:12:11,wallstreetbets,"With 2 billion + active users that log in and watch videos a month, and about 30 million + subscribers of youtube red/music (5 million on trial), those 1.965 billion users will now get ads on those 56 million channels"
2021-05-21 13:28:53,wallstreetbets,"What do you think would happen if they did? Youtubers lose their jobs? Google suddenly becomes a charity? No, they would absolutely destroy any attempts at blocking ads on their websites, probably changing the whole internet as we know it in the process.  


Adblocker only works if minority uses it. The second majority starts using it, you're entering a dangerous space of fucking with revenue of a $1.5T company, and you don't want that."
2021-05-21 13:35:17,wallstreetbets,If it was a bad product destined for failure it wouldn't be used by every third person on earth (it has 2.3B users) and increasing year over year.

2021-05-21 10:49:15,wallstreetbets,"Ad blockers are cool.  Brave has one built in.  They allow you to select how many ads you want to see (0 is an option).  If you choose to be sent advertisements, they're non-invasive, they don't track you, and you get paid for your attention."
2021-05-21 10:07:43,wallstreetbets,Ad blocker needs to IPO to raise money because ain’t no one who uses them daily donates enough to keep operations running.

2021-05-21 12:45:53,wallstreetbets,"works as a browser, with no ads. Vanced Youtube is the app you want to get around ads and still have a nice experience. It's a 3rd party app, so a little more complex to install."

Maybe one day you see an ad for a new fast food item. While you don't really care about it to actively go buy it, maybe the next time you are out around lunchtime and see the place you figure maybe ill try that new sandwich it seemed interesting enough.

Ads aren't meant to make you go buy or order an item right away, just to make it so that they are in your mind."
2021-05-21 12:42:59,wallstreetbets,almost as bad as instagram ads....wanna pay $150 for some mail order shoes from a company you've never heard of that will take a month to arrive? me neither.
2021-05-21 07:14:53,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, the ad creates a pavlovian negative association"
2021-05-20 23:50:10,wallstreetbets,"It’s a net positive for google for sure I think, bad news for people expecting good results from these ads IMO"
2021-05-20 23:58:35,wallstreetbets,"I stopped using YouTube, it's a waste of time, advertisements just kept reminding me of that, so I stopped surfing it.  If there's something I need I'll find it, but I stopped just watching.  YouTube numbers will decline as better platforms grow.

You fed right into it immediately.

2021-05-21 13:35:06,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure the majority of users on the internet use it. There is nothing YouTube can do about it. On their end, the ad is still being played as part of their video player coding, the blocker just blocks it from showing. 

YouTube may own the player and video content, but the codecs and plugins needed to play videos on a browser are free source. They will never be able to stop that. 

Could they potentially block access to YouTube? Sure. They can even put a paywall, but then they would lose too much traffic and it would hurt them.  Most content creators use several media web hosts. They would just stop using YT."

2021-05-21 08:13:35,wallstreetbets,Can confirm. Google can target users so well that it is basically guaranteed that everyone that clicks on our adwords ads will make a purchase.
2021-05-21 16:26:26,wallstreetbets,"Yep, people can say the ads don't work on them, but they likely do."

2021-05-21 03:48:44,wallstreetbets,"This is incredibly naiive and so are all the people upvoting you. Every company spends money on advertising. And if you didn't learn about a product through an ad, the person telling you about it probably did."
2021-05-21 03:28:34,wallstreetbets,Clearly you have zero understanding of marketing and selling a product lol
2021-05-21 12:46:03,wallstreetbets,"This is so dumb. As a small owner, there is no viable way of getting your online shop etc seen without advertising lol"
2021-05-21 05:48:03,wallstreetbets,"Marketing helps you sell the product which gets everyone paid and increases the budget for developing the product (s) further.

Most businesses rely on marketing in some form. There are rare exceptions like Tesla but even their CEO is constantly pulling stunts that keep the brand in the news.

Maybe you're being targeted by weaker companies because you fit into certain demographics but you don't necessarily share common interests with your cohort.

I mean Apple and Nike are two of the most successful companies on the planet and they constantly advertise just to maintain social relevancy. And I bet you have at least one of their products in your household."
2021-05-21 03:09:13,wallstreetbets,Correct
2021-05-20 23:54:17,wallstreetbets,"Most of snapchat's ads are 5 seconds and advertisers get their point across. Kinda like when in the first 5 seconds of a youtibe ad, some guru tells me ""wait don't skip if you don't want to lose money"" they 100% know everyone skips"
2021-05-21 02:26:23,wallstreetbets,"Unless those competitors have Google levels of money, they’ll never be able to compete. YouTube was operating at a loss for years (and they still might idk). Even with the amount of shit a lot of creators get from YouTube, they rarely move to a site like Dailymotion or Vimeo because the market share isn’t there. The closest competitor I can think of is Twitch and that’s only because they’re way ahead of anyone with live-streaming

Thankfully, I don’t think YouTube has started doing anti-Adblock shenanigans yet so this isn’t a huge change for me"
2021-05-21 00:02:22,wallstreetbets,"Vimeo has also been around for a while and I'm pretty sure youtube showed them up as I rarely even hear of them anymore. I hate to say it but I think youtube is around to stay. The invested tons into youtube TV and youtube red exclusive content and I hate to say it but I'm one of those users and even though it is $10 a month for yt red, playing videos in the background and no ads really makes the process a whole lot better and I know that each time I watch a channel's video with red, they get paid."

Google chrome has some of the best extensions for blocking YouTube ads and it’s been downloaded millions of times. 

It’s open source. They can’t do anything about it. YouTube has continually gotten more strict with ads and content, and users push back and create apps to bypass it. This isn’t new. It’s been happening for years and years. Maybe you just haven’t been aware of it.

2021-05-21 05:50:58,wallstreetbets,"> It's not naive. 

Of course it is. Every single company in the world uses marketing for their products. If the criteria you have for choosing products is *marketing in channels that I'm not watching*, that just makes no sense at all. 

>There's a particular shitty radio ad where I live, and I will never, ever do business with that stupid shit company, because I hate their ads, and change the station as soon as I hear the first second of it.

you mean to tell me they intended to become a S corp? 

Is that also why they tried to get everyone to use their real name and tie it to their google email account.. Colored me shocked. trying to set up marketing profiles with peoples real ID like Microsoft does.

If you can't figure it out I am taking the piss and still doesn't refute my claim that youtube by it self doesn't provide enough revenue to pay for it's costs. Sure Google can use it to justify its use for other means but as a profit seeking company their fucking whale isn't profitable to maintain it self it was left alone.

2021-05-21 18:42:55,wallstreetbets,"We've gone from ""money pit"" to ""not profitable"" to ""not profitable if you take out everything Google builds with it"". I think you're getting the picture.

The one part I think you're still hung up on is ""why does no one else do video hosting if it really is a good investment"". That part's really down to scale.... it really only makes sense if you're a trillion dollar tech giant. The value of the dataset comes from its colossal raw size, so you need to be able to foot the cost of hosting a huge video site (at a loss, like you said), and also have use cases that can exploit all that data to earn the billions of profit needed to make up on it. 

FAANG sized corps can eat that loss as a long term investment, then they use it to make AI products that AI 10x harder than any startup or midsized firm's can. They earn billions on those, and eventually that money pit starts looking more like a moat.

Say Waymo uses Google's superior video data set to create road-safe computer vision algorithms, then uses it to get first-mover advantage in self driving cars. The couple billion of losses Google ate hosting cat videos will all be paid back 100x over."
2021-05-21 14:04:23,wallstreetbets,"It’s even funnier that we live in a world where reading is difficult. Had you even bothered, you’d see the data for 27% only account for useage in the US. 

You’d also see that the article warns that several large countries aren’t included, such as China and Hong Kong, or that the article was only looking at those who use the google search engine, which is only 1 of many search engines used by people. 

Nor does the article cover anything about ad blocking on YouTube.

And you also skipped over the part that the US data was taken in 2019, which is before COVID-19 where internet usage greatly expanded due to everyone being stuck indoors.

2021-05-21 11:22:55,wallstreetbets,"I didn't care for their business model. You had to wait in line for people ahead to go through the concession line before you could get tickets and go in. Then when you get close people show up with super fan pass club, or some shit, and skip to the front of the line. I liked Hollywood theaters much better."

Not only that, but you have eyes dont you? look at the charts. in 4 months we are already at half way point of the highs we were at back in january just from buying and holding the stock. When it comes or how long it takes does not matter, charts dont lie. AMC is on a uptrend, we are beating down the shorts, we are very clearly winning. We just need to break that 14.50 resistance."

2021-05-21 13:03:52,wallstreetbets,Of course it has potential but right now GME is not going anywhere near the moon until it gets volume. If gme was trading around $50 it would of squeezed long time ago but its too expensive for retail traders because its already overvalued on top of no sentiment its just going to barcode for a bit until amc flys. I think the guys who is bashing amc isnt experienced traders and riding that first squeeze or whatever it was like its a normal thing in the stock market.
2021-05-21 15:28:46,wallstreetbets,Man I dont want to see a bunch of conservative shit either. Honestly what is so bad about not wanting politics to be injected into the place I go to escape from how shitty society is?

2021-05-21 11:02:24,wallstreetbets,You are too retarded to talk to or you are too embarrassed to say you do not know how to read and interpret charts. 99% chance you are both tho. Convo is done.
2021-05-21 16:26:19,wallstreetbets,My $800 flat screen and $400 speakers are much better than the theater that we have. Live in a small town. We don't have a cinamax.
2021-05-21 17:09:22,wallstreetbets,Eh I dont really have a metric for it. It’s really just if I feel like a decision was made for political reasons as opposed to what makes for a good movie. Like if you’re doing a movie about NWA then of course you are going to have a scene with police brutality. If you’re doing a remake of Cinderella do you really need to make the fairy god mother a black gay man in drag?   Anything that takes you out of the movie is a problem regardless of wether it’s political or not. Politics is just a sure fire way to do it though. Honestly it seemed like they just didn’t plan on opening up so soon because it was a lot of seemingly low budget movies that are more celeb art projects than actual movie people want to see. Again I’m usually very big on theatres and love the previews but I saw maybe one movie coming up that looked good

2021-05-21 09:24:14,wallstreetbets,"We'll see. It was trending downwards before the pandemic, so you might see a surge from people tired of staying at home, but people are turning away from movie theaters year after year.

YOU may think it's something people will continue to enjoy and do more and more, but everyone downvoting are likely AMC bag holders who don't want to hear the truth, that the movie theater industry is continuing to decline in attendance and sales."
2021-05-21 11:48:36,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Watching a movie at home does not match the same energy and feeling from watching it at the theaters. Theaters are a special experience
2021-05-21 12:16:29,wallstreetbets,What’s the strike? I think you’ve got a chance— there’s definitely a potential ramp set up for today
2021-05-21 11:34:19,wallstreetbets,Probably has it shorted...
2021-05-21 17:30:23,wallstreetbets,Okay but a black gay fairy godmother sounds fucking awesome. Why does the remix upset you? The OG isn't banner. 🤷
2021-05-21 09:39:35,wallstreetbets,AMC really needs to change the experience of the movies. We will see if they can actually do it. I think all major movies will still release in the theaters first but if disney decides to move all their kids movies to streaming then the theaters are going to be in some trouble.
2021-05-21 10:01:02,wallstreetbets,"Does no one on these boards know how to read charts? we have been having upward trend for AMC since after that january high. The chart is very bullish for AMC right now. even if you ignore the fucking squeeze, this is CLEARLY a bullish movement for AMC just on technicals alone."
2021-05-21 12:17:59,wallstreetbets,XD I should be fine. I bought 28$ calls but sold 29$ calls for the exact same price.
2021-05-21 11:37:51,wallstreetbets,"Nope, only puts."
2021-05-21 17:36:53,wallstreetbets,It in and of itself doesn’t bother me at all. I super dont give a shit. Again it’s just very clearly them making a political statement. I just want to watch a movie and not think about politics....again why is that so bad.
2021-05-21 10:03:23,wallstreetbets,"AMC  stock may be behaving independently from earnings for the time being, but the overall outlook of the industry will not sustain this.

If a squeeze does happen, sure, there will be some short-lived gains, but long term does not look good here. So if you're in it for the squeeze potential, good luck, but if you see this lasting beyond a little squeeze to $20-30, you may end up holding these bags all the way back down."
2021-05-21 13:37:41,wallstreetbets,"Charts? No one knows anything about market cap and shares outstanding that buys into this stock with that thought in mind. Sure it might of hit $30 years ago. But that was when they had **350,000,000 LESS SHARES OUTSTANDING!** The stock is currently trading at a higher valuation than it's ever had in it's history. But most apes are too dumb to realize this, and too new to the market to understand this basic principle."
2021-05-21 12:18:19,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-05-21 11:05:22,wallstreetbets,"Company has been making positive turn arounds last few months, not sure why people are ignoring this and just looking at what they were pre pandemic. only time will tell how the turn around the company after retail pulled them out of bankruptcy. CEO has admitted this multiple times btw and acknowledged how retail are the ones that saved them. We own the company, CEO is actually communicating with community. We will see if those efforts were in vain or not."
2021-05-21 17:22:11,wallstreetbets,"Really not sure what you are not understanding. I thought i made it clear before. It should be plain as day. The price is going up on the stock. The malicious and blatant and aggressive shorting of the stock is losing to the retail investor.  I pointed out charts to show we are winning, that amc is not the penny stock shorts want it to be.

You need to understand that they tried to bankrupt this company purposely and they almost succeeded.  But retail investors stepped in, seen the bullshit, saved the company, and now we own the float. We are saying this company is worth more. Alot more. Analyst saying this is worth 0.01? Bull shit. No ape is selling their shares for that much"
2021-05-21 12:18:50,wallstreetbets,but hey. if it had been today I'd have made 10.9k XD
2021-05-21 12:30:22,wallstreetbets,I'm actually doing the same for next week 27-28$ calls both are at .08. I have 0 risk but a shit ton of upside when it does pop off.
2021-05-21 11:19:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm not going to go as far as to say it's a dying industry, but all signs point to it being a struggling industry. The company can do whatever they want behind those front doors, but if the trend is moving away from movie theaters and towards streaming, there's not a whole lot any movie theater CEO can do. 30-40 years ago, phone companies made their money on phone land lines. Technology shifted this towards internet and cellular, and the phone companies became broadband internet and cellular companies in response. Technology threatens the movie theater experience in much the same way. A monumental blow was the decision to offer box office new releases direct to streaming on day 1. There's talk of pulling back on that post-pandemic, but the threat remains.

I'm only one person, so you may view this as anecdotal, but seriously look up the trend away from theaters and towards streaming, it began in 2018-2019, long before the pandemic. I personally have gone to movie theaters less and less over the last 20 years, from 1-2 visits per month in the 2000's to 3-4 per year in 2010-2015, to 0-1 per year 2015-2020. It also doesn't mean I just never go out, I just don't consider a movie a ""going out"" activity anymore, it's been replaced by zoos, snowboarding, go-karts, golf driving range (Top Golf is fun as hell for non-golf-types), carnivals, apple orchards, hiking, outdoor concerts, beach volleyball... etc etc etc. Movies are: get some popcorn going, rent a new release to play on my 65"" tv with surround sound in the basement. My next home will have a dedicated theater in the basement with an 85""+ sized screen and even better sound.

Again, let me reiterate, while that's a lot of personal preference, I am part of the statistics that clearly show a trend away from movie theaters over the last 3-4 years."

How close are we to that?  You didn't bring it up, you don't want to fix things. you just roll your eyes and bitch about people wanting to defend themselves rather than address the real problems.

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Does the government and fed allow/ encourage naked shorting. So I went down the rabbit hole a while back after being a meme stock bear.  Mind blown. All I have to say is watch Wes Christian. I had been trading for a decade and you apes opened this world up to me.  

However I was deep thinking, so I started digging.  We never recovered from the 08 crisis.  They just dropped interest rates and turned on the printer.  

Now in 11-12 I was a security guard for a company that made coins for the us mint/ tiff jewelry.  Gold was crazy 16-1700$ an once.  It’s gone up 150-200$ an oz in the decade where we printed more money than we have since our founding. 

What if the government knew they were fucked and told hedge funds to naked short everything till oblivion. 


Hear me out, you naked short bonds, stocks and precious metals on paper. Like diluing the silver paper market and wal lah you drive the silver market to the ground which effects the price of actual silver.  You now control inflation or anything. 

Where does this leave us? In a market where everything is fake that 25$ an once silver you bought is actually worth 100$ because for every legit oz on the market there’s at least 4x the oz that are sold are synthetic. No rules for short sellers. 

What if the government gave the green light to the short sellers to do what they do and dilute so the masses love the government for free money but at the same time keep inflation under control.  Short the market so that we don’t have to answer for the fact we never recovered from the 08 crash and never raised interest rates.  

Apes look up academic papers from the 08 collapse and what’s going on now naked shorting is on the rise.  

It’s nuts

So fuck it 1000 shares on the market.  When in reality there’s only a 100. Retail buys and they are all classified as FTRs (failure to receive) the other end of ftd.  Congrats you just innocently diluted the market 10x over.  Now when you purposely manipulate it you send your ftds outside the secs jurisdiction.   Guess what the buyer got his synthetic and the seller passed the buck.  Usually in Canada, Asia, or just wrapped up in a bond. 

It’s all done by computers dude.  You need a lawyer to dig through every trade for years to see where the synthetics came from ( they are 100% doing that on meme stocks because of the loss of income due to dillution) or have the company issue dividends.   The company pays the real shares the dividend, the synthetics get paid by the creators of the synthetic. You slowly drain them of their money.

2021-05-21 09:19:21,wallstreetbets,"I feel for you. It may not be your path in life to have biological kids, but adoption is always an option. There may be a child out there right now who needs you as a parent."
2021-05-21 06:06:18,wallstreetbets,harder than my coc when my wife’s boyfriend gets out of the shower #nohomo
2021-05-21 15:56:07,wallstreetbets,You look at me. I am the patriarchy now.
2021-05-21 09:22:58,wallstreetbets,The more kids the more ROI. Go get as many as god will give you!
2021-05-21 16:38:46,wallstreetbets,Hollywood kids 😆 if you have enough one will become famous and support you
2021-05-21 02:06:52,wallstreetbets,Sorry brother for telling the only thing that will happen. In the next few years PLTR will contract down to 1x Revenue.
2021-05-21 03:25:55,wallstreetbets,2 dollars = 3.8 billion market cap. No reason to trade at 30x revenue.
2021-05-21 09:03:39,wallstreetbets,Cathie gonna come in and buy millions of shares like she has when it dipped to $17-$18
2021-05-21 02:07:58,wallstreetbets,Will not happen. The data they collect can't be used at other customers. Lol. It's a shitty business.
2021-05-21 07:43:29,wallstreetbets,That's what their Apollo software is for.
2021-05-21 09:34:57,wallstreetbets,"Yep, we're in the system"
2021-05-21 07:24:41,wallstreetbets,Thats just respect
2021-05-21 06:14:20,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-05-21 11:46:01,wallstreetbets,Go get as many as Dog will give you!
2021-05-21 02:29:08,wallstreetbets,"I mean that’s your opinion but I see the bear case for PLTR being $100 2025 minimum and that’s fine by me, Rome wasn’t built in a day. Realistically PLTR is one of those companies that get in and stay in, continually get larger and larger deals with the companies and government industries and they can’t get rid of them because they don’t know how they even survived before foundry."
2021-05-21 08:22:56,wallstreetbets,Yes PLTR will def trade at half the market cap of an oat milk company
2021-05-21 02:49:10,wallstreetbets,"They don't ""collect"" data."
2021-05-21 02:14:51,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. It's an enterprise software business, but heavy on services with highly customized deployments. It may not get down to $2, but it definitely won't skyrocket."
2021-05-21 09:38:11,wallstreetbets,"I know it's pretty rough right now. I have close friends who are wanting to adopt, too, but they said the number of cases available to people since COVID hit are much, much smaller than before. They're keeping their spirits up but I imagine it's got to be tough."
2021-05-21 09:59:53,wallstreetbets,o7o
2021-05-21 06:50:33,wallstreetbets,harder than my wifes cock
2021-05-21 08:04:28,wallstreetbets,That's one of the most retarded price targets for any stock I've ever seen. I hope for your sake I'm missing the sarcasm here.
2021-05-21 02:40:08,wallstreetbets,Lol. Trading at 200x revenue? What's your expected profit and revenue for 2025?
2021-05-21 09:02:00,wallstreetbets,You try to milk an oat and then tell me a company that has figured out how to do that isn’t worth billions.
2021-05-21 08:45:42,wallstreetbets,Now you understand.
2021-05-21 02:52:40,wallstreetbets,Aloo these clowns really saying PLTR will drop to 2 dollars a share ?!
2021-05-21 02:55:20,wallstreetbets,Why don’t you think the price will increase after multiple good earnings beats?
2021-05-21 02:20:03,wallstreetbets,"Well, maybe not two but four dollar a share. Those professional services companies don't earn more than 15% operating margin or in the palantir case 210 million EBIT. Subtract 20% Tax and you get to ca. 170 million in earnings. What's a fair valuation for a service company? Maybe something like 20x or 3.4 billion in Market Cap?"
2021-05-21 09:46:17,wallstreetbets,We need people back in the clubs so we can get those unwanted pregnancies up.
2021-05-21 06:55:35,wallstreetbets,"Wait... how long did it take her to grow one? Mine doesn’t have one yet, been waiting for long time too."
2021-05-21 11:53:52,wallstreetbets,Infinite.
2021-05-21 03:31:06,wallstreetbets,"I'm not saying it's not overvalued, but man... That guy 🤡🤡"
2021-05-21 15:04:04,wallstreetbets,After GME ruined this sub I have a really hard time telling when people are being ironically retarded or they are just actually retarded.
2021-05-21 09:23:26,wallstreetbets,I have literally no idea what the fuck PLTR is but if Reddit Stock ExpertsTM are pushing it I'm going to avoid it with a 10 foot pole and assume it's gonna be worth $0 after 5 years because it turned out to be one scam or another.
2021-05-21 03:22:00,wallstreetbets,"That clown will wait and see how it goes down month by month. As I mentioned, there's no rationality for a 40 billion valuation. Not even for 10 billion. ;) Even the management doesn't believe in that business. Slowly selling shares... Lol don't be dumb owning a piece of crap in your portfolio."
2021-05-21 07:34:53,wallstreetbets,Because there always has to be a contrarian
2021-05-21 11:04:53,wallstreetbets,"They do professional services but they also do SaaS like a Salesforce or SAP.

And their partnering with amazon for ERP....oh yea"
2021-05-21 07:41:09,wallstreetbets,wait.....girlfriend's don't have the peen?
2021-05-21 12:21:33,wallstreetbets,"Alright guys, good luck. Come back to that comment as soon as you lose all your savings. Lol."
2021-05-21 15:35:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah.   I’m very confused.   Oh well.    I’m not leaving and no FUD is going to run me off.
2021-05-21 08:53:42,wallstreetbets,Harder than my wife’s gf coc on a blue chew
2021-05-21 12:32:35,wallstreetbets,"I mean, if it goes to $2 then I technically haven't lost all my savings :)"
2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Damn you retarded apes! Damn you all to hell! 
2021-05-20 22:26:47,wallstreetbets,Why are you mad? You're now among our top candidates for this month's retard of the month !
2021-05-20 22:40:08,wallstreetbets,The market can remain retarded longer than you can remain solvent
2021-05-20 22:08:43,wallstreetbets,Yo 13k for 1 contract that nuts what is even upside in this play even it goes to 10$ max you would make is 20k risk reward is terrible
2021-05-20 22:05:32,wallstreetbets, It’s not our fault that you’re retarded
2021-05-20 23:59:22,wallstreetbets,Same guy that shat on DFV.
2021-05-20 22:10:46,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow. Anyways, what did everyone have for dinner?"
2021-05-20 22:39:28,wallstreetbets,"Options trading monkey business, do not blame apes"
2021-05-20 22:14:52,wallstreetbets,"Oh well, good thing its just money."
2021-05-20 23:53:37,wallstreetbets,"You could have actually made money on that most of February, why the duck did you keep holding it?"
2021-05-20 22:11:24,wallstreetbets,"Should've sold that put, not bought it, dumbass."
2021-05-20 22:08:15,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for sharing, never go full retard"
2021-05-20 22:45:32,wallstreetbets,Respect for posting this in a room full of animals
2021-05-21 04:31:37,wallstreetbets,"Of all the things you could inverse on this subreddit... you choose the one thing that stings the hardest. I hope you are aware that in the 4 coming weeks, GME is expected to rise further and may even squeeze / go nuclear."
2021-05-20 22:08:22,wallstreetbets,LOL
2021-05-20 23:58:12,wallstreetbets,"
Decide to burn 14k in a single contract, and you bet against GME?  At least you only have 46% left to lose. 🤣"
2021-05-20 22:46:46,wallstreetbets,Ahahah. That break even price is what hedge funds have wet dreams about. Ain’t happening!

2021-05-20 22:08:48,wallstreetbets,Dumbass you went puts on support
2021-05-20 22:33:51,wallstreetbets,"Been out of the game too long, you’re losing money because you paid too much to buy the option, requiring a drastic drop in stock price to break even, even though you’re ITM right now?"
2021-05-20 22:59:44,wallstreetbets,"Always wondered about what happens with those deep itm options with high premiums. Good now I get it, thanks for trying it out."
2021-05-20 22:04:30,wallstreetbets,Haha stonks go brrrrrr
2021-05-21 00:13:55,wallstreetbets,"Wow. I don't even feel sorry for you.

2021-05-21 00:40:26,wallstreetbets,"Dumbass, why not buy actual shares?"
2021-05-21 01:07:39,wallstreetbets,"lol. But I don't blame you for this bad decision, you're just misinformed"
2021-05-21 02:46:01,wallstreetbets,Your stupidity is not apes fault. No ape told you buy Put/Call instead shares. And you went full retard to Put on very volatile stock.

You should also consider making less retarded plays, but you always gotta weigh USD versus karma gained."
2021-05-20 22:36:10,wallstreetbets,Wtf is a $210 put?

2021-05-20 23:46:32,wallstreetbets,You have till July so you may make money. Then again if IV goes down you will lose money even if the stock drops.
2021-05-20 23:51:53,wallstreetbets,"Geez, GME doesn't fall below $140. Suppose it does fall below $140, then it's a buy or a call. This is true until a significant number of States return to the office at full capacity in the U.S."

2021-05-21 01:25:48,wallstreetbets,You should’ve short the stock for the unlimited loss 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2021-05-21 01:27:44,wallstreetbets,Hahaha yesss. Bleed for mee. Thanks for posting this actually. Melvin and Citadel won't show us theirs😝
2021-05-21 01:29:49,wallstreetbets,"Can’t he sell a $220 strike put for the same expiration and essentially turn this into a put spread and recover this trade to a lower his overall loss? 
Collect premium for the $220 strike put. When/if they expire itm in July, the sold put gets exercised and the bought put covers the sell. 

You’re still probably gonna lose money but this way not as much."
2021-05-21 01:33:07,wallstreetbets,"It’s a drinking night, so I’m pretty sure I’ve got this wrong, but it looks like you bet against GameStop and then posted it on WSB.

2021-05-21 01:40:50,wallstreetbets,Those are rookie numbers
2021-05-21 01:53:20,wallstreetbets,"You're getting Theta gangbanged. Unless you intend to own the underlying asset you don't really want to hold onto options long especially this high of IV.

I mean you can go long or short it's just... well yeah the math isn't on your side. You paid a 14,000 premium for a single contract. Meaning the price of the asset needed to drop 140 from your strike just to break even (in rough terms)

IOW shares would need to trade at sub 70 just to make a profit. It can happen but damn. And option pricing isn't always linear especially with the IV on GME."

2021-05-21 04:10:31,wallstreetbets,Sawy!
2021-05-21 04:11:08,wallstreetbets,Maybe next time it'll work.
2021-05-21 04:26:11,wallstreetbets,"Mate, you obviously don't understand how an option contract works.

There is something called time decay in options (among other things), meaning the value of the options exponentially decays in value in the last 1-2 months until expiry and it will converge to the intrinsic value i.e. the value of the stock and your strike price. one way to think of this is your option contract will lose 2/3 of its time value in the last 1/3 of its life and the value of the options is made up of time and intrinsic value.

if you ever want to speculate again, best to buy longer-dated options, at least 2-3 months longer than the expected event. e.g if you expect some news to happen in July, you should be looking to buy the September/October dated contracts so that you have time to get the heck out if the 'event' does not occur with some of your money (approx 2/3 of the time value).

&#x200B;

good luck in the future and better luck next time.

&#x200B;

you might find it useful to spend $1k on some options course to educate yourself before you lose anymore money. Alternatively, there are heaps of youtube videos on this topic."

2021-05-21 05:08:04,wallstreetbets,They blew it all up!
2021-05-21 05:10:32,wallstreetbets,That’s what happens if you invest based on market sentiment😉

2021-05-21 06:04:15,wallstreetbets,Why are you guys purposefully burning your monies? I thought we were supposed to be retarded as a joke...
2021-05-21 06:08:14,wallstreetbets,Even at the current value you could sell that and get 35 shares. Or you can hold it until it’s worth zero.

2021-05-21 12:43:40,wallstreetbets,"~~They're going to print though~~

EDIT: holy shit, just realized you got fucked by the high premium, you need $GME to totally shit the bed just in order to break even. RIP. You can maybe try to wait for $GME to dip in order to gain a little bit more time value, but risky as theta will rape you if $GME stays flat."
2021-05-21 12:47:50,wallstreetbets,"Did you click the put button instead of the call button by mistake??![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface) Just 2 more dollars then I'm back to even, then waiting for the 26th. I was such a retard buying at 177 need to learn some patience but anyway I'm in."

2021-05-21 17:38:15,wallstreetbets,Hard to buy puts on GME. I've tried before for just quick flips and even though the price went lower I was lossing on the put. Made no sense. Need the price to move pretty fast and significantly to make money on the puts. Same with AMC.
2021-05-21 17:49:47,wallstreetbets,Break even price $70 LOL

2021-05-21 07:24:53,wallstreetbets,"Dafaq how you got this cash?

1Min of real research would change your mind from Put to Shares.

2021-05-21 09:16:22,wallstreetbets,Why would you buy puts on GameStop you pussy
2021-05-21 09:52:32,wallstreetbets,Idk how anyone is still in on GME. Amc was such a better investment I day traded AmC for months while it went from 4$ to 7$ then to 9$ to 11$ and finally 14$ and I pulled out fully. And it was great. While you fools have stated in the dying horse this whole time for no reason LOL
2021-05-21 09:54:32,wallstreetbets,That's what you get shorty!
2021-05-21 10:01:07,wallstreetbets,Are you here to be consoled that you bet against us and lost?

2021-05-21 11:50:19,wallstreetbets,"I really don't get you guys and your puts, for GME is easy, you just buy, hold and then you become greedy. You started by being greedy with puts."
2021-05-21 12:00:16,wallstreetbets,"If you dont believe in GME just sell. There are enough ppl holding that cost those currupt hedge funds millions of dollars each day. And one day the squeeze will happen, there are enough ppl holding. You can be one of us, or just sell now lol."
2021-05-21 12:03:35,wallstreetbets,"If you blame the apes you have understood nothing. It's the shortselling HFs who are naked, over-leveraged, and over-exposed. Apes are just buying and holding."

So I feel like I know a lot about the videogame industry. I feel like most of you are gamers too. 

So I'm genuinely curious as to how you think Gamestop is going to prosper. What are your top theories/predictions?

2021-05-21 02:14:34,wallstreetbets,"They can actually pay out well, as well. It just depends on how much capital you have to front it. What may not pay out is buying options with high premiums due to extremely high IV mixed with time value. Or buying stupidly OTM options."

2021-05-21 01:41:58,wallstreetbets,"Right? If he opened one right now (well tomorrow) he could reduce his loss greatly by selling the $220 put and turning this into a spread. 
It could be reduced or possibly even reversed if there’s a dip soon and prices turn downward for a couple of days. Premium will be even higher on the sell."

2021-05-21 02:11:44,wallstreetbets,I made 4k in one day betting against GME. Then it shot up. Ironically I was going to turn around and buy the bullish calls which would have printed even more money but I put it into something safer. Once that plays out in a couple weeks I'll look to scalp bear or bull options on GME again. Hopefully AMC is still up because I'm definitely buying puts on that overpriced crap. I probably should now but I don't want to liquidate the other position just yet. Couple more weeks.
2021-05-20 22:06:35,wallstreetbets,This is the way!

2021-05-21 02:36:15,wallstreetbets,"Or reinvest the remaining value by eating the loss. Passing on unrealized gains is worse than taking a realized loss or even a realized wash.

His option is currently 40 in the money. His premium means it needs to be over 70 to have any real value.

I'd sell to close, take that 6k and buy 13p on AMC for July. He can get 20 contracts. Large drop will print or gradual drop but he needs to sell it mid June if gradual before he gets theta banged again. I think AMC will drop sharply so it'll at least print him 2k if I had to guess. That's a quarter of what he lost."
2021-05-21 02:39:38,wallstreetbets,"That would have printed very decently for a very short position for most of February whether he exercised or simply sold to close. Then if he turned around and actually bought shares with the proceeds... he would be up quite a bit for a 14k investment

But if ifs and buts were candy and nuts then every day would be Christmas."
2021-05-21 01:27:26,wallstreetbets,I thought it could go lower haha

2021-05-20 23:16:09,wallstreetbets,GME _is_ the game. Meta.
2021-05-20 23:29:38,wallstreetbets,"Just some thoughts off the top of my head:

- Moving into esports
- Expanding online sales by providing a wider variety of PC components and same-day delivery
- Hosting in-store tournaments
- Implementation of a more native digital games purchasing pipeline (connecting GS account with Steam/PSN/XBL account)
- Customer-centric business model
- Loyal customer base (both to GameStop and RC)

I don’t expect every b&m store to remain open, but I believe GameStop will finally catch up to the rest of the industry as far as online sales & offerings, service, and esports. I think the future is bright for GameStop under the new leadership."
2021-05-20 23:20:43,wallstreetbets,Well then you should know about diehard fans
2021-05-20 23:27:39,wallstreetbets,"Get some shares you retard,
Predictions? Every Ape will continue to support GameStop whenever they want to buy games, consoles, monitors, etc  why buy from anywhere else when GameStop’s got it? Kinda like how we always shop on Amazon instead of going down the block"
2021-05-20 23:23:40,wallstreetbets,"There are a few options:

* Gaming accessories (controllers, mice, keyboards and other things you wreck when you spill soda on)
* Hardware (consoles, video cards, motherboards, CPUs and power supplies come to mind that you need to play that latest / greatest release)
* Software (games, collector editions, posters)

Some of us do like to get the hands-on experience and would like to get a feel for different headsets, or have an immediate need for a controller for the kid home from college.  

Even though there is a niche for e-commerce and online downloading (e.g. Steam and the M$ store) some of us still do go for a hard-copy, though digital downloads are available.  

E.g.  I just ordered a $40 trilogy copy of the Dawn/Rise/War for the Planet of the Apes and realized there's a poster that comes with it.  Same thing for Aliens 6-disk version.  

If there's an older game I've got interested in for nostalgia, such as Gauntlet or Diablo (before a new version is released) it's a GME that I might head to.  

And they need an internet cafe, with coffee.  I'd go there over SBUX at that point for the background conversation / noise."

From curing diseases to cleaning up the world to buying a house for the first time in generations for a family so sir this is why we hold this why we are ape this is why you lose this game

2021-05-20 23:44:50,wallstreetbets,"For a perfect medium rare grilled strip loin...

Beat your meat hard. Seriously. Tenderizing does wonders and it lowers stress.

Add salt and pepper, or your favorite steak spice or marinade. (Note, if marinating, let it sit in the marinade for at least least few hours, preferably overnight.... good quality steak needs nothing added)

Get the grill hot. Greater than 500F, but if your grill can push 6 or 700 go for it.

Sear it on each side, max 2.5 minutes depending on thickness. One flip only.

Remove it from the grill and enjoy."

2021-05-21 02:24:22,wallstreetbets,"Protip: High volatility and no real merit to valuation means cash that out when you can.

If you think about the math it would have told you this was a bad play to hold that long. If I buy your option right now, for 60 bucks, I'm out 6,000 and the price difference at the moment is 4,000. I'd lose 2k unless it dropped further. There's still some time value to try and make some profit but since this stock keeps trading sideways for weeks with some spikes up, it's a losing proposition for me.

Now cheap FDs for intraday scalps.... risky as fuck but more likely to print some money over yours.

I would sell that thing for a loss and put that 6,000 to work making money back.

I speak from experience. I ate a 8,000 loss on GME... but the 16,000 I got out of it I scalped GME for 4k and now have it elsewhere that is up 12,000. So I'm double profit what my loss was. Worst part is I could have easily quadrupled profit had I bit the bullet earlier and put my money to work. 

Oh well, I was stubborn because my position was actually a money maker it just tied my capital up for a long fucking time unless I ate a loss. Instead of losing 8k I'd be up a good 36,000... instead I'm only up 16. 

So you're losing even more money off of unrealized gains because you're letting it decay on a shit option even if it did pay out days before expiry and for a measly few hundred bucks."

And if you look at the position it expires in July."
2021-05-21 15:16:43,wallstreetbets,"🤦‍♂️

Look at how much the option cost originally and then look at how much it's worth now.

How exactly do you figure the guy who sold it to him *isn't* up?"
2021-05-20 23:09:05,wallstreetbets,"The IV was fucking retarded so the price he paid for the option contract meant his actual profit strike was WAAAAAAAAAY below the actual strike.

The cheaper your contract costs, the better your breakeven will be, because the price of the contract always eats away at your profits, which in turn changes your breakeven price."
2021-05-20 23:30:18,wallstreetbets,"There are a number of factors that go into an option’s price. The easiest one is the intrinsic value which for a put which equals the strike minus the price of the underlying (if it’s less than 0 the intrinsic value is 0) so in this case 210 - 170 = 40. And it represents 100 shares so 40*100= 4,000. It’s the value you make if you immediately exercised the option and then sold all the shares. 

The remaining factors that go into an option’s price are collectively called extrinsic value. The two main ones are time value and implied volatility. The more time till expiration an option has, the more time for the price of the underlying to move and the more time for the option to appreciate in value. So when you buy an option you pay the seller for all of the extrinsic value. As you get closer to expiration that extrinsic value will start to disappear and the time value of the option will slowly fall off. Look up more about theta if you want to learn about that. Options thats are out of the money time value decays faster, options in the money time value decays slower. 

The other big one is implied volatility which is a measure of how much the price of the underlying is expected to move. When he bought this, gamestop was moving like crazy, the implied volatility was through the roof. When he purchased that option, he had to pay the seller for that volatility. Well now the price bas calmed down so the volatility has disappeared and lots of time has passed so time value has devoured most of the value of this option. 

Like it says above he needs gamestop to be at $70.20 by expiration for this to break even. Or he needs this to absolutely tank in the coming months for some delta movement in his favor and for iv to pick back up."
2021-05-20 22:51:46,wallstreetbets,"Premium dude, PREMIUMMMM"
2021-05-21 04:00:09,wallstreetbets,"It says there that his break even price is $70. Even though it was a $210 put, he doesn't actually make any money due to how *crazy* expensive the option was unless the price drops below $70, preferably *significantly* lower than $70."

2021-05-21 13:32:36,wallstreetbets,"Making a guess tbh, we know AMC is a WSB favourite and their CEO said during their earnings call that 80% of the float was owned by small individual investors, and GME has a bigger following than AMC so i think it would be pretty safe to say the GME float is at least 80% retail owned

&#x200B;

""AMC said it had 3.2 million individual shareholders as of March 11, who own about 80% of the 450 million shares outstanding. Many of them were inspired by the r/wallstreetbets Reddit page to purchase the stock."""

2021-05-20 23:29:36,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm ok. You really seem to emphasize 'customers first'. Can you be more specific on that? 

I imagine most companies would like to to be 'customers first'.

Also, how do you imagine Gamestop would get a chunk of digi sales? I don't imagine Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo is going to cut them in."
2021-05-20 23:36:21,wallstreetbets,"Those are some interesting thoughts. 

In terms of online sales, I think it's going to be *incredibly* difficult/impossible to get a piece of Microsoft, Sony, or Nintendo's online sales. I think the best they could do is keep selling online gift cards.  

In-store tournaments sound like a cool idea, but that also sounds like something that would require a ***very*** dedicated and passionate staff, at each store, to maintain.   


Trying to scale that to their 5000 stores doesn't seem feasible."
2021-05-20 23:22:06,wallstreetbets,You mean DieHard Trilogy on PS1 or DieHard Arcade on Sega Saturn? Please be more specific.
2021-05-20 23:26:54,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm those are interesting theories. 

&#x200B;

But that all sounds pretty similar to what they've already been doing for the past couple decades. 

&#x200B;

I guess selling CPUs and power supplies would be pretty new, but I think that would require a pretty large inventory and pretty educated staff. I imagine your average Gamestop employee has probably never applied thermal paste before."

Absolutely hysterical.

2021-05-20 23:31:23,wallstreetbets,"Ok well that's all wonderful, but I thought this was initially about Gamestop's share price being artificially manipulated downward by shortsellers. 

Aren't you kindof proposing the same thing, but in reverse?"
2021-05-20 23:44:09,wallstreetbets,"Except, and hear me out, the more one tries to close the market gap, like Nintendo, the more people don’t like the inconvenience of waiting, or having few options. 

That’s why so many companies exist to bring you food, or drinks, or drive you around. Digital is all fine, until it isn’t. 

There will also be collectors, and traders in games and products. 

It’s easy to say avenues will close, but inventive people find ways around that. A lot more people want gamer stuff. The comfort, and the quickness. 

I doubt Nintendo sells chairs, headsets, and gear. 

It won’t just be T-shirts, there’s a lot that belongs to being a hardcore gamer. 

People need to stop making GME dead, and acting like in the future gaming magically exists because you can download the game. 

It would cost Nintendo more to set up their own warehouses for distribution of their systems than just allowing another retailer to have them for sale, and let that cost burden be on them. 

If GME was smart they would have talks about being the only ones who can warehouse their systems and do same day delivery. 

There are more options, it’s what the new CEO and board decide."
2021-05-20 23:31:49,wallstreetbets,Lol fair enough
2021-05-21 13:04:39,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure what you're referring to. 

  
I'm not aware of any trend pointing in the direction of people spending more money on physical releases and less on digital.   


The newest consoles (PS5, Xbox Series X) are $100 cheaper if you buy the versions without disk drives."

2021-05-21 05:03:34,wallstreetbets,"I get your drift, I'm saying it's even worse than most people suspect. The HFs that are eating shit through all of this brought this on themselves by *intentionally* building out a sub that glorifies losing money on options, and a small section of the sub saw through the bullshit and decided to hold onto one of the biggest stocks they were shorting instead of buying options. That's the real reason for the ape migration to other subs. My thesis is that they didn't just fuck themselves by shorting so hard. They double fucked themselves by trying to goad retail into shorting it as well, and that didn't work out. Ie, the post we are commenting in right now."

2021-05-20 23:42:48,wallstreetbets,"Lol first off I don't know why you're being downvoted it was a genuine question from you i think.  But reddit is weird sometimes i've been downvoted for translating OP for something before lolol.

I've read and seen posts about Ryan Cohan but don't think i can dig them up to link for you, but here are some quotes/anecdotes i'm butchering but i'm sure you'll get the spirit of it.

First off 'customer first' is the standard big corps adhere to but there is customer first and EXCEPTIONAL customer first.

\-Ryan turned Chewy into multi billion dollar company that is better than even amazon when it comes to pet stuff.

\-IIRC someone quote Ryan as saying ""if you have a choice of making some extra money or delighting a customer always delight the customer""

\-Poster talked about how her dog died and chewy legit sent her flowers or some shit

\-Gamestop was having a ton of issues with customer service.  Ryan Cohen personally emailed a customer about some return policy that the customer was stuck in a months long cycle with 'old' GME with

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-gamestop-cohen-insight-idUSKBN2BF1AS

\-Same day delivery-- they use doordash to deliver items to customers.  Sick.

""Cohen aims to turn GameStop into the “Chewy of gaming” with lower prices, better selection and faster delivery times, said the sources, most of them speaking on condition of anonymity.""

&#x200B;

TBH i'm not sure how he's going to get a cut of digi sales ATM."
2021-05-21 05:19:49,wallstreetbets,"You shorted GME without knowing any of this?

You truly have a Teflon brain."
2021-05-21 06:22:21,wallstreetbets,"You also are underestimating memepower. Look at dog themed money, the previous president of the usa, tsla, etc. Gamestop is about to be the most popular gaming company (if it already isn't). Memes are the most bullish indicator in today's market."
2021-05-20 23:45:43,wallstreetbets,"They have already transformed some of their stores into tournament hubs. Which looks promising. You also don’t need tournaments in every single store. I have three GameStops within a 3 mile radius of me, with like 5 or 6 in my city (which isn’t even a big city). So I would only expect one store in that cluster to host a tournament.

As far as getting a piece of online sales, that could be true. But they already get a piece of the sale of membership cards, digital game code sales, point cards, etc. Not to mention, Microsoft and GameStop already have a great partnership, so it wouldn’t be out of the question, imo.

Like I said, a lot of stores will probably close if they can’t make them profitable. But they are valuable as they serve as mini-fulfillment stores for same-day delivery."

Why would Nintendo want to limit their consoles to one store?"
2021-05-21 00:56:22,wallstreetbets,"Well that’s the whole point people don’t want to wait... we’re not queuing up at midnight for a new game ever again, it’s all ez pz downloads ... shit even better than disc that never get damaged.. new games cannot even fit on any disc because their 100gb+ so don’t deny for a moment that people will opt for a plastic disc to act as a fake key because maybe they can sell it back to GameStop for $4 store credit next year 🤣 unfortunately that has always been GameStop’s bread and butter selling a .05cent disc for $60 ... consoles just won’t make up for that loss long term.. those are facts .. there is a good reason GameStop was targeted to be shorted down to hell. But that’s a different story now. Facts are that digital downloads are going to cut GameStop out of the picture. Period. Now the heat is on them to milk the new consoles for all they can. Paint a story for investors that a specialty online retailer can be worth a multi billion dollar valuation (maybe it can be? A lot of new dumber things are making those numbers) and they have to figure out what to do with basically having a store in damn near every mall in America that sells a staple product that will no longer be physically bought within a few years (anyone remember seeing around a tower records?) This just is what it is the way I see it because that’s the way it really is man... great pickup at $4 a share for a undervalued company with assets... but 100 whatever + for a dying retail chain is more risk than a lot of people want to think about... long term I hope they do better than a toys-r-us kinda story but I’m not holding anything I don’t have a clear belief in.. shit I went into a GameStop a couple weeks ago to buy the new Xbox and they told me I would have to sign up online and do this and that and wait and whatever and I said fuck it I’ll just order that shit in a few months on Amazon because it’s no different and less work... anyway bottom line is you can find something better to invest into at this point if you want to buy and hold with less headaches and more upside... I always recommend and hold Google for instance"

As far as myself personally, yea I'd love for there to be more places to sell games, but this isn't really about what I want, so much as what I think customers are likely to do with their money.   


The cheaper Xbox and PS5 skus don't even have disk drives and PC games haven't been a thing at retail for over a decade."
2021-05-21 13:53:57,wallstreetbets,"Well which digital sales market are you talking about? 

&#x200B;

It's hard to picture Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo allowing Gamestop to have their own separate store on their platforms. 

&#x200B;

It's possible that they could try to launch a Steam competitor, but in order to do that successfully, you ***need*** to have exclusive titles. I suppose they could pay for exclusivity the way that the Epic Store has, but it's still a massive multi-year undertaking."
2021-05-20 23:18:23,wallstreetbets,"That's where you're wrong,  kid"
2021-05-20 23:14:59,wallstreetbets,"$210 put, if the stock had a $0 price, that’d be worth the full $210 per share.  $210 x 100 = $21k.  Probably not the smartest play OP could have made"
2021-05-20 23:15:26,wallstreetbets,Do the math for me please 210p worth 50k whats the fucking breakeven for someone to buy it god damn retard
2021-05-21 15:26:07,wallstreetbets,"Ever wonder why? I mean there are companies doing less worth more. Why is there such a negative sentiment around this particular stock?

2021-05-21 10:00:32,wallstreetbets,"Not everyone downloads (most, but not everyone) and consoles/pc components combined with same-day delivery is a huge perk for customers. Amazon isn’t even that good. 

Yeah, it’s going to be a lot of work for sure. But every great business transformation is.

I personally believe the new leadership can do it. They’ve already done an incredible job just in the last five months by paying down all debt, raising $500m (which is now $800m in cash on hand), setting up same-day delivery, setting up their esports department, and improving their customer service by moving the call support to the US from overseas. 

They have a long way to go, but they aren’t even close to the same company that they were 6 months ago and I think that’s worth investing in.

What’s the slot machine thing you’re talking about?"
2021-05-21 04:22:31,wallstreetbets,His post is about his puts..

2021-05-20 23:44:29,wallstreetbets,See we’re not manipulating the stock we’re showing it has value... way more value they anyone gave them credit for were saving an undervalued American company which we need more of..
2021-05-21 04:30:49,wallstreetbets,"I had hope for you but I don't think you're gonna get it.

Maybe buy another round of puts and see what it does in about a months time 😉😉😉 

Good luck with whichever direction you end up going"
2021-05-21 11:05:46,wallstreetbets,How is it manipulating if all we do it buy and not sell 🤣
2021-05-21 14:06:49,wallstreetbets,"Similar to steam or epic, but the one thing GME has that those 2 dont, is a worldwide brand name. Yes it’s a massive undertaking, but no one said this pivot would be easy. Also, this is just one small piece in their grand plan. They are also introducing same day delivery for more than just games, and they are going to be entering the esport arena. Imagine COD tourneys being held at refreshed GME stores, that could host everyone and while people are there, either spectating or participating, they would probably see something on the shelves and think “ oh yea, I need one of those” and buy it in the stores. They are opening themselves up to multiple revenue streams. Just think, RC and crew have already turned GME from a company that was 300 mill in debt, to a company that has no long term debt and is sitting on half a billion dollars to implement their new strategies. That is not something I would want to bet against atm. Also, the IV alone will absolutely obliterate any chance you had at gains because the cost of that option was outrageously priced. Best of luck to you though."

2021-05-21 08:13:23,wallstreetbets,I was not aware. How does clean up go tho?
2021-05-21 15:19:08,wallstreetbets,"....but you didn't actually say ""I think that"" or anything like that in your comment.

I'm pretty sure that claiming things like that without disclosing that it's only in your head is called ""bullshitting""."
2021-05-20 22:31:26,wallstreetbets,Ban
2021-05-21 00:26:46,wallstreetbets,"Well, to be fair, ""brick and mortar store that sells a few chairs, PC parts, and console games"" doesn't really sound super exciting. 

It sounds kinda like Radio Shack / Circuit City / Comp USA / Fry's."
2021-05-21 13:20:15,wallstreetbets,"Well I think most of the things you're giving them credit for are a result of this subreddit, not their amazing leadership. Yall filled their pockets with cash.

&#x200B;

I think a new online store specializing in PC and console hardware is going to have a much more difficult time than [Chewy.com](https://Chewy.com).

&#x200B;

If I'm looking to buy a RTX 3070 GPU (assuming a future where they're actually available), I'm going to go for the lowest price, even if that means I have to wait a day for delivery. 

&#x200B;

Also profit margins on things like that, because of all of the competition, are very slim."
2021-05-21 14:12:19,wallstreetbets,">As far as the esports tournament idea goes, I'm a little skeptical:  
>  
>1. That sounds like the kindof thing that would need specialized dedicated staff. Seems like it would be almost impossible to scale that up to their \~5000 stores.   
>  
>2. It doesn't seem like your average gamestop store would have enough floor space to host both tournaments and display inventory."
2021-05-21 14:31:23,wallstreetbets,"Also, to address your point on worldwide brand name, I'm not sure that the Gamestop brand is known outside of the United States"
2021-05-20 23:25:50,wallstreetbets,I'd love to know exactly how I've given you money?
2021-05-20 23:19:05,wallstreetbets,The maximum value of the put contract there is $21k.  He bought when IV was fucking maxed.  Nobody is paying >$21k for that contract unless they’re fucking retarded.  Do you know how options work?
2021-05-20 23:21:11,wallstreetbets,Bruh you gotta stop trading
2021-05-21 15:39:28,wallstreetbets,"I let it rest before and after.

I think cooking it hot and fast “lock” in juices in the sense that you aren’t losing all the juice on the grill. The longer it cooks, the more moisture you lose.

So... “lock in” isn’t the right word, but I’m not sure how to casually describe it.

Keeps the meat moist?"
2021-05-21 08:50:39,wallstreetbets,Oh I dont know sorry. I just googled. I still use the one time uses.

2021-05-20 22:33:09,wallstreetbets,"A part of me wants to just start banning people who say “buy shares never play options,” just because they’re too idiotic to know what options are and don’t realize WallStreetBETS is a gambling sub."
2021-05-21 01:05:16,wallstreetbets,"its not just that, GME is stepping into the realm of “trend” stores (think hot topic but for gamers) and selling toys plushies and other trinkets that are harder to get a hold of for more casual consumers"
2021-05-21 09:28:32,wallstreetbets,It isn't about the brick and mortar lmao wtf? They are moving into the PC digital space and PC parts DELIVERY space. They deliver consoles and other nerd shit what more do you want? They sell everything videogame related and deliver it same day so not sure where your comparison to boomer retail stores is realistic. No one can predict the future but the moves they are making paint a good picture.
2021-05-21 00:36:46,wallstreetbets,"Online sales, like Chewy or Amazon.  In fact they just leased a 700,000 sq ft fulfillment warehouse.  Gaming makes more money than Movies and all American sports combined.  And gamestop is going to focus on that

2021-05-21 13:57:56,wallstreetbets,This is a great company. They write USDA loans in Rural areas. The direct loans are middle class income earners. And the PMI is low compared to FHA.  I sure hope it doesn’t fail. Lol. I bought today on the dip. Couldn’t help it.
2021-05-20 22:20:34,wallstreetbets,"Sell Jan 2023 $17c and get $9,000 today and collect $5,000 more in dividends until then with a chance of 2x+ if called."

2021-05-21 16:34:45,wallstreetbets,"97 shares, figured I didn't want to miss the squeeze if it does happen.
Still waiting on amc 😂😂"
2021-05-21 18:19:16,wallstreetbets,I’m in at 170 shares average of $8.05. Let it ride
2021-05-21 18:46:43,wallstreetbets,"I'm in 5200 shares deep and the more it dips, the more I buy"
2021-05-21 19:27:02,wallstreetbets,And I thought I was being retarded for having 300 shares
2021-05-21 17:41:15,wallstreetbets,Fuck your shares.
2021-05-20 23:21:16,wallstreetbets,If I have 5/21 7.50c should I just sell them tomorrow? I was hoping this would squeeze this week but it's starting to look like it won't.
2021-05-21 01:46:39,wallstreetbets,Now that u say that it will open at $0 tomorrow 🤡
2021-05-21 06:44:44,wallstreetbets,Good luck. You’ll need it

2021-05-21 16:05:31,wallstreetbets,13 shares at 8.03 :')
2021-05-20 22:44:10,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, set some limit orders. Wait for an intro-day dip. Then accumulate and average down with every dip. At the end of the day, UWMC has huge upside with little risk. Dividends are still yielding ~5% based on the current share price, it pays to be on the margin."
2021-05-21 05:26:31,wallstreetbets,Ill hop in on this for a few shares after open
2021-05-20 23:12:08,wallstreetbets,Candle sticks still bullish! Still good to enter tomorrow!
2021-05-21 09:53:47,wallstreetbets,Right now is the good entry price
2021-05-21 14:23:04,wallstreetbets,"I had positions with both. Ultimately divested RKT and went with UWMC. 

RKT has pretty good margins on the retail side. However, UWMC is gearing up with really aggressive pricing on the wholesale side that RKT cannot sustain.

Matt Ishbia is laser-focused on one thing and one thing only. Capturing share on the wholesale side. Whereas RKT is focused on diversifying into auto and other loans. They also spend a ton on customer acquisition costs."
2021-05-20 22:06:28,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-21 14:23:58,wallstreetbets,Thanks for sharing your perspective
2021-05-20 22:30:36,wallstreetbets,How many calls do you have to sell to get that???
2021-05-20 22:23:31,wallstreetbets,Good thought. Sold all of my covered calls. Will be loading back up soon.
2021-05-21 18:00:48,wallstreetbets,Just sell monthly 9c or 10c and profit more
2021-05-20 23:14:03,wallstreetbets,Jesus what kind of stop loss did you have. Thing barely moved all day
2021-05-20 22:45:55,wallstreetbets,"Yes. The MMs will fight hard to keep the 5/21 calls OTM. But once tomorrow passes, they have less incentive to keep the price depressed. I feel like this stock will start making moves next week."
2021-05-21 07:02:57,wallstreetbets,"I can't stop trading enough to stop using it tbh, and that instant settlement"
2021-05-21 00:22:57,wallstreetbets,$10 please god
2021-05-20 22:12:14,wallstreetbets,Whats happening tomorrow?
2021-05-20 21:52:11,wallstreetbets,"Low float, won’t take much"
2021-05-21 14:31:59,wallstreetbets,"You only live once, so make a sound long term investment in a stable company 🤣"
2021-05-21 03:55:35,wallstreetbets,"yeah, sadly, would have been a good accelerator"
2021-05-21 08:49:40,wallstreetbets,"It was a $20 ""fuck it"""
2021-05-21 07:03:54,wallstreetbets,Yes.  It keeps my lists consolidated this way.
2021-05-21 04:31:14,wallstreetbets,"I mean, that’s cool that you own one stock..but you don’t need to buy a stock to keep track of a company. Depending on which brokerage you use there are different ways to setup customized watchlists and you can keep an eye on stocks easily. Wait till the stock hits a price you like and then buy in with an actual position."
2021-05-21 10:17:56,wallstreetbets,"Right there with you on the ""buy one and watch it move"" bit.

Helps me from buying into shitty plays and lets me still get that sweet dopamine hit.

That being said I've got 650 shares of this and I wish GME would have done something by now, I was really hoping to be able to dunk all my GME profits into this before the dividend :("
2021-05-21 16:09:13,wallstreetbets,Oof
2021-05-21 17:42:35,wallstreetbets,Nice average
2021-05-21 09:27:47,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is very undervalued, pays a 5% dividend, and selling covered calls is usually a sure win because it doesn't pop over 10 easily. It's basically guranteed income that can feed other gambling habits mwahah"
2021-05-21 10:46:15,wallstreetbets,What’s the Bull case? Would love to see some DD.
2021-05-21 11:06:10,wallstreetbets,Up a whole .13 over the past 3 months
2021-05-21 11:41:41,wallstreetbets,"Sell covered calls then, easy money to be made off these degenerate gamblers"
2021-05-21 17:43:38,wallstreetbets,Eat mine if UWMC has better Q2 earnings 😘
2021-05-20 22:17:03,wallstreetbets,Bearish. Refis expected to go down in Q2. UWMC is the only originator projecting growth.
2021-05-21 07:04:33,wallstreetbets,Ja! Garbage comment.
2021-05-21 16:19:36,wallstreetbets,lot of people had calls expiring today.
2021-05-21 17:42:15,wallstreetbets,Thank you 😘
2021-05-21 00:26:08,wallstreetbets,"If u have $7.50 calls, u will own 100 shares by the end of the day, unless u sell the call."
2021-05-21 05:14:58,wallstreetbets,Often times selling the call yields more. You should do the math.
2021-05-20 21:45:34,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Slow sure moves over years, you'll be ok."
2021-05-20 22:13:21,wallstreetbets,That’s definitely the goal!
2021-05-20 22:06:59,wallstreetbets,What’s your Bear case?

2021-05-21 18:49:04,wallstreetbets,I sold PLTR leaps for $6 that are worth $0.40 now. Monthlies/Weeklies are not always the best call.
2021-05-21 00:34:13,wallstreetbets,"Wet, shit stained toilet paper hands stop loss"
2021-05-20 22:47:37,wallstreetbets,"I’ll be ready. I saved up some capital for this, Fighting to close above 7.50."
2021-05-21 03:38:30,wallstreetbets,"If you're begging, might as well ask for $11."
2021-05-20 22:14:13,wallstreetbets,"Shitload of open interest on 5/21 options. Could be nothing, could be something. I’m riding it out either way."
2021-05-21 11:24:55,wallstreetbets,if you had bought those nvda calls ;)
2021-05-21 12:00:57,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, shares just sit.  Covered call is the way with this one."
2021-05-20 22:32:30,wallstreetbets,"I like to think I’m a fan of mortgage lending but the industry appears to be lagging and mortgages to be getting cheaper and cheaper on consumers, that’s just how I feel. BUT with low interest rates this looks like potentially a great play for the next few years especially when rates go back up."
2021-05-21 07:53:30,wallstreetbets,Glad I sold at $13.10.
2021-05-21 17:46:29,wallstreetbets,Head over to r/investing

2021-05-21 00:16:45,wallstreetbets,Its a phrase that had nothing to do with gme at first. Run along and play with the other kids
2021-05-20 22:43:22,wallstreetbets,I would have to own 8500 shares right???
2021-05-20 22:21:15,wallstreetbets,"Got it. Mark my words, its nothing."
2021-05-21 11:36:32,wallstreetbets,"True, but it's yolo nature versus wealth building. I bought a couple AMC calls last Thursday that ended up doing 2400%. If I had put all I had in UWMC in that instead it woulda printed hard. But I tried it the next day and lost money right away

My point simply being that UWMC can be guranteed income versus glorified gambling income. Risk versus reward, and there's extremely little risk here with good reward"
2021-05-21 12:03:48,wallstreetbets,Do t forget that nice dividend too
2021-05-20 22:43:14,wallstreetbets,"Interest rates are down but home prices are at record highs. And unlike refi specialists, originators will profit from post-pandemic interest increases."
2021-05-20 22:53:09,wallstreetbets,Gain on sale margins (commission/total loan value) are expected to decline for UWMC to ~1%. Pricing for consumers will be very competitive. UWMC intends to take share. At 1% it can still be profitable unlike its competitors.
2021-05-21 08:15:46,wallstreetbets,"I'm glad I sold in the double digits too,  and glad I bought back in when the price pushed down into $6 territory.  😙"
2021-05-21 17:50:27,wallstreetbets,UWMC pays a dividend too! Love my boomer stock
2021-05-21 19:07:18,wallstreetbets,It went down today! Didn’t do a lot of research was busy getting shoes!
2021-05-21 19:07:47,wallstreetbets,Looking to liquidate some of my portfolio so I can get into AMC. Hopefully big moves next week with AMC!

\>nobody will ever believe me because I have bipolar disorder and was having a manic episode at the time

The thing I don't understand is that my mental illness doesn't cause visual hallucinations. There were no other anomalies or sights during my many months of being extremely manic, although there were definitely mental delusions and erratic behaviour. The aliens I saw were crystal clear both times, one sighting being just a UFO at night but the second encounter I was literally less than 5 feet away from two creatures that had just parked a normal-looking minivan in a dark parking lot at the beach at 4:00am, letters $SPY on the side.

2021-05-21 00:52:19,wallstreetbets,A couple weeks back Someone here joked made about buying defense stocks due to the recent UFO news. That argument now has credence. We are going to need the fanciest Lockheed laser weapons if UFOs are real

2021-05-21 11:45:56,wallstreetbets,"More like this:

Bush talked about releasing UFOs files then 9/11 happened. 

Last year Trump signed executive order saying Pentagon was one year deadline to release all UFO files. Then CoVid 19 happened."
2021-05-21 13:57:53,wallstreetbets,Truly insightful. It's rumored that 'they' are trying to get us used to the idea of aliens before the US government comes out of their alien closet to the public. I bet those smart little buggers could make a fortune gambling on stonks. Put us retards to shame.
2021-05-20 21:33:50,wallstreetbets,100% correct. Each major release happens between April and May.
2021-05-21 06:26:32,wallstreetbets,Alien working for the Pentagon here..... can confirm we have shorted SPY but it was an accident. then it worked out so we left it.

2021-05-20 21:58:20,wallstreetbets,When did you buy this? At that cost it must have been months ago. Should have cut your losses.

2021-05-20 21:31:44,wallstreetbets,I honestly have no idea where to even start with options.

2021-05-20 21:32:00,wallstreetbets,I don’t get how people can continue to hold still after more than a 50 percent loss lol
2021-05-20 22:59:43,wallstreetbets,Dude I just started options today (see my post) and even I know you just gave yourself a load of croc 🤣

2021-05-20 22:50:29,wallstreetbets,When you buy options can you lose more money than you have? I’m asking if you can do puts and calls that are not on margin so you only risk money you have in your account?

2021-05-20 22:18:55,wallstreetbets,QS was poppin off and I thought for sure with Biden taking over and the push for clean energy 😅
2021-05-20 21:26:38,wallstreetbets,I’ll take my dollar and from the ashes I will rise!
2021-05-21 01:27:19,wallstreetbets,"Right, most expensive options ever. Must have bought when IV was through the roof."
2021-05-20 21:39:27,wallstreetbets,Then you probably shouldn't start with options
2021-05-20 21:48:53,wallstreetbets,Don't get curious. There's no way out
2021-05-21 01:35:24,wallstreetbets,Be a seller. Sell people like OP these types of calls
2021-05-20 23:16:25,wallstreetbets,That’s how you start 😊
2021-05-21 05:54:04,wallstreetbets,Start by buying and selling them. Trading them is easiest and pretty profitable if you have time to pay attention to the markets.
2021-05-21 01:01:30,wallstreetbets,Just do what he did
2021-05-21 00:59:30,wallstreetbets,I think it happened because the contract is expiring worthless and he is losing the whole entire premium. I’m new to options so just double check what im saying. I believe the maximum loss is the premium. Can anyone confirm lol?
2021-05-21 01:07:15,wallstreetbets,"My initial investment was $6,680 to purchase a call contract for 100 shares of QS and this was back in December just before it peaked. So the contract expires tomorrow and is now worth $1."
2021-05-21 01:15:10,wallstreetbets,"Do you see in the top left of his screenshot, he purchased (+1 ""contract""). A contract is equal to a batch of (100) shares. In the middle right of his screenshot, you can see that the stock price at the time of purchase was $66.80.  

If you move the decimal over 2 digits to the right of the share price, you will get what the purchase price of what 1 contract would equal to. . . 66.80 ---> 6680.00, or $6,680.00. 

His sole bet cost him $6,680.

OP is placing a bet, (he says at the time this was in December of 2020, that the stock, QS would reach $121.80 by expiration, which is tomorrow, 5/21/21. Since the stock did not do well,  currently @ $27.60. . . he did not fair well on this ""bet.""  

Anything above the ""strike/breakeven"" price, and he makes good money. He's no where near that, but there is a few hours left, and all of tomorrow for a miracle to unfold. 

&#x200B;

Good luck!"
2021-05-20 21:33:32,wallstreetbets,They happen to not be a paper handed bitch like you 🙂

2021-05-20 22:55:47,wallstreetbets,Damn. Thats your first mistake...No elites in power really want clean energy. They fly their private jets to events to tell you what you are doing is bad. Do you know how much it cost to fly Air Force One? They dont care unfortunately 😅
2021-05-20 21:53:32,wallstreetbets,You’ll not have that dollar when contract expires 😂
2021-05-20 22:29:19,wallstreetbets,Agreed however how will I learn without taking a chance?
2021-05-20 22:28:26,wallstreetbets,It's too late I'm already curious the risk is high but the reward looks amazing
2021-05-21 02:04:06,wallstreetbets,"Umm yeah. He just hates money pretty much. Should have tried to bail out months ago. But, imagine this thing just gets passed around repeatedly to multiple people while the seller took a ski trip. Be the seller."
2021-05-21 01:19:23,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. What if he came in slightly below the break even price, would he still make money, or just lose less?"
2021-05-20 21:38:23,wallstreetbets,Well diamond handing obviously didn’t work this time
2021-05-20 23:48:00,wallstreetbets,I don’t but would love to know
2021-05-21 00:59:39,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-20 22:53:08,wallstreetbets,Dude. No. That is not the way believe me. I tried. I ordered a book just to start learning. Try that
2021-05-21 03:36:54,wallstreetbets,"You learn by learning about them, not buy panicking as your money inexplicably bleeds out of your portfolio on an option you thought would profitable. Investopedia has all the information you need. If you need more the book 'understanding options' is basically options for dummies.

They aren't super complicated but the concepts can seem pretty foreign at first and take a while to wrap your head around, but once you start to get it they are pretty intuitive. 

Here's a short list of questions you should be able to answer before you start trading options.

1. What is the difference between a Call and a Put

2. What are the potential benefits of buying a call VS buying shares. What are the risks?

3. What are the potential benefits to selling Covered calls on the shares you already own? What are the potential downsides.

4. What are the two main uses for buying Puts?

5. What does it mean to sell a cash secured put? What are the pros/cons of doing so?

6. What are the Greeks? Specifically what are Delta, Theta, and Vega? In what ways do they impact the value of an option?"
2021-05-21 03:17:42,wallstreetbets,"I mean learn CSP first, and several other theta gang strategies, that is probably the only consistent way to lower your holding cost for your underlying asset."
2021-05-21 01:34:23,wallstreetbets,"There's lots of ways without losing real money, quickly.

But if you want to learn the easy way, send me $25K, I'll send you my 3 part patented options education system"
2021-05-21 02:08:14,wallstreetbets,"Eh that’s what I did. Let’s just say I learned some EXPENSIVE LESSONS REAL QUICK. 

Tbh though for me it ended up being worth it in the long run because now I know how to react to catalysts and pick solid options."
2021-05-21 07:46:59,wallstreetbets,"These people think you have to bet the farm on options apparently.

You can buy FDs for $5 a contract on some companies.

Just pick a few winners out of those and see how they do in the next month. You’ll see how underlying moves change your gains and how theta crushes you as you get close to expiry. 

Totally possible to learn through experience without getting crushed. 

Just ya know, don’t do it with $60 options."
2021-05-21 01:33:23,wallstreetbets,"No problem mate, In your scenario, he would still be ""Out of the Money, or OTM,"" which means that his option bet has no ""intrinsic value."" But if you tow that line with no ""diamond hands"", you can still trade OTM options to other traders in strategies such as covered calls or protective puts, and earn some of your investment back."
2021-05-20 22:56:59,wallstreetbets, 👆 hes not wrong though
2021-05-21 00:04:05,wallstreetbets,"4 billion a year. Maybe a little less. But you know...""they care"""
2021-05-21 01:01:31,wallstreetbets,I bet 50 cents if anyone buys it 😂
2021-05-21 00:44:32,wallstreetbets,"4 bill was the estimate to replace Air Force One under Trump. Green transportation may well fail to take off due to elites being comfortable, but come up with a better argument than ""one plane costs 4 billion a year to fly"", cause it doesn't"
2021-05-21 01:19:39,wallstreetbets,See this is what I love. You are right in I read my article context wrong. I'll admit that. But now seeing every article talk nothing but about Donald Trump tells me all I need to know. Okay. Now instead of that same fucking story on every article ever. It cost well over a hundred K per hour. Now you go do the math on how much it cost per year...it to much. Moral of the story. Trump or not. They dont care...

2021-05-21 03:38:02,wallstreetbets,You’ve been holding longer than me. December 2019.
2021-05-21 06:39:12,wallstreetbets,"This isnt just a nat gas play. It is an LNG play. TELL has an Integrated business model. Being the producer as well as the liquefier. Also, world class management team. Charif Souki practically single-handedly created the US LNG export industry at Cheniere. Project is shovel ready. Much of the engineering is complete. All permits secured. Just need to secure the long term deals and financing."
2021-05-21 02:46:09,wallstreetbets,"Current estimates are for the peak oil/gas demand to be in 2040. At the same time, investments in oil and gas are severely reduced already. This will lead to the oil price and the lng price having tea on the moon.  


People heavily underestimate how much fossil fuels are needed. And gas is so much better compared to coal that right now (!) we are building gas power plants. I don't see that demand coming down any time soon."

2021-05-20 23:28:45,wallstreetbets,Ride w me marmom!
2021-05-21 03:08:03,wallstreetbets,"Story time: I'm living in Germany. We put a lot of effort into renewables and we have plastered our country with wind power plants. We do not really have good sun, but we put tons of solar panels on homes anyways. [This is our current energy mix](https://strom-report.de/medien/strommix-2020-stromerzeugung-deutschland-1.jpg).

How should we close the gap? Keep in mind that the energy demand is rising each year. We need to up our solar like 6x because everything else barely scales at this point. Just not going to happen. Hope we get to fusion before 2050 and until that time, we try to replace our coal with gas. Nuclear is politically not feasible, but I think we will be importing nuclear power from our neighbors at some point.

EDIT: Also solar has problems with storage. Imo it will never be a base-load energy source.

EDIT2: And this is Germany, a super developed country. Now ask yourself what is going on in china, India or African countries when they start pushing into an industrialized stage."
2021-05-21 05:29:38,wallstreetbets,How do you think power is/has been generated in our day and age? Genuinely curious of your answer.
2021-05-21 09:53:23,wallstreetbets,"There are some ways it's being used in a less damaging way, for instance converting coal plants to LNG. If every step in the supply chain is managed ethically (extraction, transport and eventual use), it can be significantly cleaner than the plant would have otherwise been.

Yup, it's still fossil fuels so it's not green but the grid can't reliably run 24/7/365'ish on renewables alone at this point. Large scale battery deployments would be a game changer in smoothing out renewables' ability to become primary sources for our grid (in the US at least) by filling in demand gaps when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.

Sorry for the long winded answer."
2021-05-21 10:01:01,wallstreetbets,"They are [developing plants to capture emissions](https://netpower.com/technology/) which is a step forward, they do burn cleaner than coal. Maybe someday they'll  be able to retrofit the existing fleet of gas burners."

2021-05-21 08:27:02,wallstreetbets,"Not a lot of it is actually green, I know that much."
2021-05-21 10:59:42,wallstreetbets,I mean ya that's nicer than what we've been doing but as you said it's still not green... And especially batteries  we gotta fix those too.
2021-05-21 10:58:23,wallstreetbets,"I mean that sounds nice, but I'd still rather innovation that gets us off the things that are bad for the environment"
2021-05-21 08:35:54,wallstreetbets,"What do you think we have done for the past 10+ years while the US government was busy denying climate change?

Massive investments are done for a long time already and research is moving slowly. What technology do you see on the horizon to save us quickly?"
2021-05-21 11:01:35,wallstreetbets,"That's why I ask if we are better off spending our money on a dinosaur or the pockets that fuel progress. 

For me this has nothing to do with politics, we only have one planet (until we colonize Mars ;))"
2021-05-21 17:03:40,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I don't understand how this relates to natural gas."

2021-05-20 22:13:39,wallstreetbets,"What was your best case scenario? Uwmc is a real stock now, it’s getting less volatile by the day. If anything you should be selling puts into a decreasing IV. If you’re trying to go to the moon amc or a biotech. If you’re just trying to make a few bucks, then selling puts will work nicely."

2021-05-20 20:08:41,wallstreetbets,"The fuck are you saying ""here goes nothing""?? Clearly you have a shit ton of money. 

You say ""here goes nothing"" when you got 50k in debt make $20 and hour and buy a weekly calls with the $1500 you saved up. 

THEN you say ""here goes nothing"". Thats legendary status. 

You just a rich man playing with shares. Pshhh."
2021-05-20 20:14:08,wallstreetbets,That's a huge position on ARKK. 1m notional

Hint, if you want to really try nothing try options"

2021-05-20 21:59:50,wallstreetbets,How the fuck do you have that much money to begin with

2021-05-20 21:14:18,wallstreetbets,TQQQ made me a lot of green after the covid crash. Also TNA. Sucks in a sideways market though.
2021-05-20 21:22:59,wallstreetbets,I’m holding RIG long term. Set a side enough I don’t care if I lose it all. RIG is too cheap here.

2021-05-21 00:34:10,wallstreetbets,Damn it took me a minute to get it.  You were pretty red recently lol!
2021-05-21 06:23:41,wallstreetbets,Any thoughts on IQ?
2021-05-21 08:27:09,wallstreetbets,Just curious why the whole ARKK not individual stocks from cathies porfolio?
2021-05-21 18:53:23,wallstreetbets,Damm how much did you make off of ba today
2021-05-20 21:59:52,wallstreetbets,Yo OP. Help a broke brother out and spot me 100 shares of that ARKK. You won't even notice they're gone from your portfolio and meanwhile it would make my portfolio look amazing compared to what it is now.
2021-05-20 20:45:33,wallstreetbets,I'd get rid of rig.buy more ARK
2021-05-20 22:08:09,wallstreetbets,"![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy) it’s a strategy that works for me, it’s like a sore dick you leave it alone. Lol thanks man!"

2021-05-20 20:28:10,wallstreetbets,Picked a great day/week to start.
2021-05-20 20:47:11,wallstreetbets,I trade from 1mil - 2mil range... 😵‍💫I don’t hold anything to long maybe make 4-10% and out. This market is a wobbly mess. I think I made 30 something trades today.  I don’t care profit is profit. I had trimmed a lot I was up to 12k shares of arkk. I dumped a lot due to Tesla being the biggest portion of the fund. Today seemed like a short covering
2021-05-21 00:17:42,wallstreetbets,"I’m a boomer bruh,  only way I can sleep options made me nuts knowing I was gonna get crushed."
2021-05-20 20:55:50,wallstreetbets,Good ol boomer stonks my friend. That’s how I made my money trading like a boomer. Options are fun but your assed out if you miss your strike price.

2021-05-20 20:15:18,wallstreetbets,The stock tanked and recovered slightly above original cost today.
2021-05-20 20:50:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I trade quiet a bit, at open, during my 9am break time (20min), any shitter breaks and 12pm lunch(35min) (pacific time). I got hosed yesterday. Eveyone selling on fed news to only recover… psh."
2021-05-21 10:15:25,wallstreetbets,"I do palantir, I was in an out of beam and tsla"
2021-05-20 20:59:04,wallstreetbets,"Why, it’s a casino my friend. Don’t you know the cheap stocks are what the poor kids go for?  It’s a psychological thing only reason Tesla had a split…😵‍💫"
2021-05-21 01:33:01,wallstreetbets,This is a casino sir. Please pull up your pants.
2021-05-20 22:10:34,wallstreetbets,"I’m just having a little fun. ARKK, not so boomer. Can make you cry or celebrate even with shares. 

But ping me if anyone *shames* you for having a enough money to trade while on a trading sub. Fucking bullshit lol"

* Filled gap convincely.
* Hit resistance 🎯 but not bullish 🎯s. Reached high of 416.63 or 0.18 from first bullish pt from this mornings read.
* Spiked @ 86 ish on RSI and ended the day @ 52 ish (Bullish). 15 min. timeframe.

W-shape with today's price action.

* For the w-shape to hold true we need to push over 418.

https://preview.redd.it/3wbsfzmypc071.png?width=2163&format=png&auto=webp&s=140453b61e599b3d2c0ff80256b7bfecf66b6df7

# 5/21 Outlook - Bullish - Neutral

* Bulls need to fill the gap on the 1D timeframe. Gap fill is at 416.72 - 418
* If Bulls find support at 418 then I believe that we hit the call wall at 419-420 - 420.53
* Best case for bulls is that we gap above and test new support @ 418.
* Bears need to protect gap. If gap is tested and resistance holds look for 415 - 414 - 412 (gap fill) - 410. I don't think we see below 410 but we shall see.

1D RSI

* RSI at 53ish (>50 = bullish)

2021-05-20 22:12:30,wallstreetbets,I've been following this for days and learned so much from you! Seriously you are a legend!
2021-05-20 21:51:37,wallstreetbets,How do you judge when a gap up or down has been sufficiently filled? I understand we’ve had a lot because of low volume. Is it some kinda implied high bid ask spread?

2021-05-21 00:50:51,wallstreetbets,what’s your suggestion on how to proceed with 419c/413p expiring tomorrow? i feel bullish and your post seems to hint that way too but i might have messed up by going a bit too far otm. also bought the put as a hedge since we are getting rug pulled without a moment’s notice these days

2021-05-20 22:28:45,wallstreetbets,Looks to me like it's time to double down.
2021-05-20 20:08:43,wallstreetbets,SPCE to the MOON you ape!
2021-05-20 20:38:54,wallstreetbets,I'm buying puts tomorrow morning.
2021-05-20 20:15:06,wallstreetbets,I rode some puts at open. Made some coin. Switched over to some calls before close on case of a run tomorrow before lift off. If it's flight next week may be good for you! Good luck.

Nope... ya bought shares and rode it down the flagpole like Super Mario."
2021-05-20 20:15:28,wallstreetbets,No bc those are shares

2021-05-20 20:54:10,wallstreetbets,You're set up pretty good. Rumour is there might be a buy out. Just hopefully the offer is over your strike...
2021-05-20 21:03:47,wallstreetbets,I with ya dude this trade ticks all my boxes.  I’m in 30 x   $50 1/21/22.  Hopefully can pick up 30 more if price is good
2021-05-20 21:13:16,wallstreetbets,Paw patrol approves this message. Id bet when football picks up and people start subbing for inside the NFL and romocasts it'll show numbers bigly
2021-05-20 21:57:10,wallstreetbets,"CBS has been an acquisition target for years. They have a complex distribution system mainly due to their Owned and Operated stations as well as affiliate distribution model. Viacom added international distribution, and a bunch of content. So it’s still an acquisition target."
2021-05-20 23:30:28,wallstreetbets,Your balls are bigger than your brain definitely.
2021-05-20 20:06:08,wallstreetbets,That stuff is good!...... I don't know what its called when you own puts and calls on the same company. I know spread is a buzzword that pops up in options talk so I figured that's what it is!
2021-05-20 20:17:36,wallstreetbets,That's an interesting mix of calls and puts
2021-05-21 04:04:55,wallstreetbets,Fk it I’m in. For some sept 17 44c’s
2021-05-21 06:53:24,wallstreetbets,"so this is a split price synthetic,  actually not a bad set up,  if price runs up your calls will be good and sell the puts worthless,  if VIAC drops you convert your puts to stocks and sell some calls on them.  please tell me you had a plan or was this random?"
2021-05-21 08:35:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that’s kind of fucking retarded there, boss"
2021-05-21 09:18:37,wallstreetbets,Ahhh goes nicely with my $90 LEAP I bought the day before it crashed 🥴🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️👜
2021-05-20 21:25:15,wallstreetbets,There’s only one yolo play and that’s GME
2021-05-20 23:46:11,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts on VIAC is mixed. First of all the stock crashed a couple months ago right when it hit 100.34. I know it might be sensible to buy it now at a discounted price but the risk is large since you would sort of want to put a bit of money in. I think over a long period of time t will go up substantially but for now I’m not certain it will make much progress to resume where it was at a couple months ago. 

-Disclaimer-
This is only a speculation from a small understatement of the actual analysis of it."
2021-05-21 00:41:42,wallstreetbets,Making money both directions. Nice.
2021-05-21 02:30:28,wallstreetbets,The big problem with these guys is that they're not a global play like most other subscription services. Paramount Plus is more of a national product. That's going to hurt them moving forward. Same thing with nbc.
2021-05-21 11:54:11,wallstreetbets,Why now tho?
2021-05-21 17:12:01,wallstreetbets,Still going up for some reason. This is a very weird feeling.
2021-05-20 22:58:34,wallstreetbets,Hey I’m short 3 $40 6/18 puts too! Also long a 1/2023 $42 call
2021-05-21 13:59:10,wallstreetbets,"They cannot compete with NFLX, Hulu, Prime, Disney. What is left is very regional, segmented content. How are they to grow subscription?"
2021-05-21 14:18:59,wallstreetbets,MS paint?
2021-05-20 21:00:06,wallstreetbets,"I only bought it because of Sponge Bob, well, if I’m honest Patrick. I’m pretty sure if he were a human he’d of yolo’d on GME."
2021-05-20 21:06:30,wallstreetbets,Any link to that rumor
2021-05-20 21:15:39,wallstreetbets,Well I don’t know what a typical premium on a take over bid but Whole Foods was 27% as an example that would bring it up to $50.80 based on $40 current price.
2021-05-20 21:16:06,wallstreetbets,And I think Bezos has a hard on for Romo... Shari  needs to pimp his sketcher wearing ass out..
2021-05-20 22:04:15,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, I only bought it because I like Sponge Bob."
2021-05-20 20:09:05,wallstreetbets,I’m sure my wife’s boyfriend is spreading her right now as I slobber over my short lived VIAC gains...
2021-05-20 20:25:41,wallstreetbets,"I’ll give you a hint, all of his positions are betting on the same direction"
2021-05-20 20:35:02,wallstreetbets,I really don’t know what the Fuck I’m doing. Out of anger I really just sold those puts.
2021-05-21 09:17:43,wallstreetbets,Yeah.. Basically I won’t sell a put unless I’m happy to be assigned at that price. I probably will buy to close those 45s if we aren’t trading around that in the next couple weeks. And I’ll sell some more 40.
2021-05-20 20:53:06,wallstreetbets,This isn't a spread. He sold puts and bought calls and shares. He's all in long.
2021-05-20 20:01:00,wallstreetbets,A spread? I don’t know what that is. Is it like Nutella. I had Nutella this morning.
2021-05-20 21:30:22,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but that cuck Cramer was bitch talking VIAC, and Melvin and Citadel also have decent short positions on it, so I said fuck it. Plus I the only show that I can watch and understand is Paw Patrol."
2021-05-21 00:09:01,wallstreetbets,Amazon’s $9B bid for MGM Studios at a p/b of 3.4x is what’s starting to fuel the Viacom call buying.  VIAC is trading at 1.4x p/b and has a rich media portfolio that could say interest Apple.  If Amazon closes MGM expect Viacom to get a massive sympathetic bump.
2021-05-20 23:56:46,wallstreetbets,"I only bought it because I watch a bunch of sponge Bob. I didn’t know it was a hundie. I just googled who owns sponge Bob, Google said viac. So I said ok Google, 🙏 I’m yolo’ing my life savings on VIAC"
2021-05-21 00:42:31,wallstreetbets,I sold dem puts. Hopefully to Shitadel.
2021-05-21 02:53:13,wallstreetbets,"They own Pluto tv, it’s ad based and global.  Which means it’s more accessible in developing markets"
2021-05-21 15:56:57,wallstreetbets,"I don’t have time to explain it. But vertical integration. 140 TV shows, 3500 movies, pulling licensing from other streaming platforms.. NFLX is esp. fucked... live sports, news, events. Pluto TV. 50 million MUAs... it’s an AVOD... works in synergy with SVOD, P+/Showtime.. 35 million subs... just look at the content they own, the studios they own, the channels they own... and that will answer your question... also it’s why Amazon or Apple is going to acquire them for 40-50 billion."
2021-05-20 21:28:25,wallstreetbets,"Whatever way it starts the day, it almost always ends the opposite."
2021-05-21 15:04:45,wallstreetbets,Yes. Make sure you post that loss porn. I need to jerk off to something.
2021-05-20 21:09:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah there was a double upgrade by BoA today... pretty strange to see an upgrade on speculation. Also, heard the talking heads on CNBC commiserate about it...

For your reading pleasure!

2021-05-20 21:35:03,wallstreetbets,"They have some really good assets... if a guy gets really lucky you'll have a bidding war... like the recent CN CPR rail spat for Kansas City Southern. From the article posted it seems they may have multiple suitors.

Fuck that'd be nice... but before you get a woody this is all SPEC.

On another note, it has come up pretty frequently on CNBC as a top pick. Both Karen Finerman and Salty Dan recommended it as did Dan Niles. Reading between the lines something is up. 

Now be warned that they're billionaires and will trick fuck you and your wife quicker than I go down on your sister... but that Dan Niles guy... I think he is quite clever. Rational thinker and doesn't seem to crave attention like these other billionaire ego-maniacs. He totally nailed Magna. I took his advice on that one and made out all right. I will continue to listen to him until I get fucked... which will happen eventually.

Do your own DD but good luck to you and yours pal.

Full disclosure, I got around 25 calls... $45/$50 strikes out in September."
2021-05-20 22:12:43,wallstreetbets,I did something similar.  Sold 3 puts at 45 and bought 3 calls at 45
2021-05-20 21:35:30,wallstreetbets,Cramer told me to buy lion electric at 32. I did. it went to 21. He told me to buy more lion electric at 21. I did. It went to 11. I sold it and everything else for GME. I might buy lion electric again after the squeeze but I hate the ugly fuck Cramer. He’s a liar and cocksucker. I personally think until all the dust settles there’s only one sure play. GameStop. Maybe Viacom will squeeze as well who knows. May the gods be with you and Viacom too.
2021-05-21 00:44:54,wallstreetbets,Sick. I’ve been meaning to try out that trade.
2021-05-21 07:51:30,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, how can I ever forget Pluto TV! They're going to make billions!"
2021-05-21 16:12:03,wallstreetbets,Amazon just had an acquisition. But eventually. Maby.
2021-05-20 21:39:29,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’ll pick up another $20k in options tomorrow
2021-05-20 22:42:18,wallstreetbets,So you’re trisomy 21 too!
2021-05-20 22:48:02,wallstreetbets,"Oh no, wait, you actually did a spread intentionally it sounds like. You actually are intelligent."
2021-05-20 21:47:47,wallstreetbets,"GME is going back to $400 and higher. It’s inevitable, and any gains I get from VIAC are going all in on GME."
2021-05-21 00:33:31,wallstreetbets,Cramer is awesome if you do the opposite of what he says.
2021-05-21 10:29:33,wallstreetbets,Comcast/nbc universal is global. They also own Sky.
2021-05-21 16:35:53,wallstreetbets,"Lol.. who did Amazon acquire? They only are in suspected talks with MGM... look, I really don’t care if you don’t like VIAC or not. But bottom line is they are a major media conglomerate, the only one left standing of any size and worth - CBS alone is huge, the most dominant prime time network, it destroys the other networks in ad revenue - also, ViacomCBS is the second largest content producer in the world, only behind Disney, and not by much... in a business where content is king, ViacomCBS has it, and it’s vertically integrated... it’s the golden goose.. and again, I cold care less about trying to convince you of anything. You’re obviously way uninformed and ignorant of the entire media space and how the industry works, because of you had even a bit of understanding, you’d see how incredibly valuable ViacomCBS is..."
2021-05-20 22:58:57,wallstreetbets,Its a synthetic stock. Same risk/reward as a stock but $0 down.
2021-05-20 21:55:18,wallstreetbets,Try millions sir.
2021-05-21 12:16:49,wallstreetbets,I'm talking subscription service.
2021-05-21 17:20:40,wallstreetbets,Wow. So defensive and aggressive and offensive. Enjoy your bag holding.
2021-05-21 00:02:02,wallstreetbets,"So. Ok. My brain. Synthetic, like a stock. Wait. Not a stock but like a stock. Wait. What."
2021-05-21 12:29:16,wallstreetbets,"Sky also offers broadband, tv, wireless and mobile just like the the US unit does."
2021-05-21 18:36:05,wallstreetbets,Lol... does it look like I’m holding bags :).. I’m up 4K on those positions... soon to be over 40k
2021-05-21 00:06:46,wallstreetbets,Ya. Fake stock. If it goes up or down the profit and loss is the same. But you dont own any of the stock.
2021-05-21 13:59:35,wallstreetbets,"They cannot compete with NFLX, Hulu, Prime, Disney. What is left is very regional, segmented content. How are they to grow subscription?"
2021-05-21 13:57:45,wallstreetbets,"I understand. I am talking about the highly competitive and segmented streaming market. In that market, in that competition. Not traditional shit they own and operate."
2021-05-21 00:10:19,wallstreetbets,Nah I get it... but it’s a piss poor way to lose all your money.
2021-05-21 14:31:26,wallstreetbets,"1. They own a tremendous amount of news, sport and other type of channels that operate all over the globe with content from all over the globe. The content is in no way segmented and is tremendously more diverse then NFLX. In Addition to a massive catalog of live tv, hit shows and movies in addition to a very large movie studio and a large theme park bussiness.
2. Peacock offers a free add supported service and a premium version for 4.99 and 9.99 a month. Peacock will be basically free for comcast to run and basically is all profit after they exit growth mode.
3. You can buy a subscription through infinity or comcast broadband/wireless to Nflx,Hulu, Prime, Hbomax, Showtime, a Starz etc. Etc.etc. so comcast wins either way because they take a cut out of all those business.
4. All of these companies pay comcast for NBC universal/Peacock content
5. Peacock grew signups from 42 million in q1 up from 33 million in the previous quarter so they must be doing something right."
2021-05-21 15:06:08,wallstreetbets,"True true. I worry about intent. ""LiveTV"" is great...but available via a lot. I'm not saying the company isn't a good play. I'm just saying they are going to have a significant struggle when it comes to subscription services. Who is going to pay for peacock over Hulu Netflix or disney? The market is so segmented, that's why everyone has been buying up each other and forming partnerships. I agree Comcast is a money maker, but again in terms of general content. They have serious issues.

I personally think that most Netflix content is shit. But they have such a first mover benefit. Also people like new content. I love AP Bio. So I sign up whenever that comes back on.lol"
2021-05-21 15:06:46,wallstreetbets,"It will be interesting how AT&t plays HBO Max as well. What's the global versus regional subscription going to be. They're at supported service is definitely going to help. They're simply too many services though. People can only afford two, at the most three. At that point it makes more sense to get a basic cable subscription and use the free services the channels provide."
2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why does JPM have to save COMEX at all? Why does JPM have to save COMEX at all?  
It might be to their advantage to do so because they are able to profit off of the availability of COMEX -- but at what price?  
In other words, saving COMEX yet again may be becoming just too *expensive* for JPM's bean counters/risk managers.  
Or maybe they simply don't have the available unencumbered silver to do this with any longer.  
JPM and their billion ounce mountain of silver may be a paper tiger. 

&#x200B;

Lets dign in !

**Comex silver warehouse .... another 1,000,000 oz is OUT OF THE VAULT, 43,000,000 oz is gone since the silverbacks arrived. This time it is all HSBC bank. And what did big powerful JP Morgan do? Nothing!! Maybe all their silver eligible is spoken for.** 

 You may be wondering why I  track JP Morgan so closely. The short story is that registered stocks are very low compared to deliveries ... a Ratio of about 3 months of supply at current delivery rates.

Yeah, so what's that got to do with JP Morgan? In the past, like July 2020, JP Morgan rode in on their big black horse and deposited 30 million oz at the onset of July 2020 deliveries. This time, at the onset of May 2021 deliveries, they rode in on their little pony and deposited just 3 million oz.

Comex needs 50 million oz to get back to a typical ratio of registered silver to deliveries. Meanwhile the bleed continues and JP Morgan has no answer or tourniquet.

The long story can be read in the links below.

2021-05-20 23:42:08,wallstreetbets,This is separate from any. This is silver being drained from the comex since the physical price is too high over the spot price.

There is little difference in their lines of business at the moment, margins are similar, products are similar. There’s very little differentiation, he’ll they’re in the same city. UWMC has had a better post-earnings period not because their top line YOY growth was so good or even indicative of something remotely possible to sustain moving forward, but really just because of the dividend and chest pounding against RKT.

I have a position in both, and before either camp starts screaming about how one is more revolutionary, or has better blah blah blah, realize that the only thing driving price action for either is public sentiment. UWMC declared a regular dividend while RKT only a special. 

Next week, either Jay Farner gets flashy (new dividend, massive auto rollout, something new) and starts publicly pushing back against Ishbia, or RKT continues downward. I think it’s 50/50 but looks ripe for anyone looking for a straddle yolo, with IV not as bad as it was before.

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Bull Cruise $CCL primed to explode 🚀🚀📈🚀 The cruise line industry has been nearly brought to extinction during the pandemic, but with the vaccines being distributed, cruise lines are making a major comeback. 
This type of play has been a gamble based on whether cruise lines are coming back this year. Now, that uncertainty is disappearing. Carnival has announced that they will resume cruising this July!
Let’s go over some pros and cons though.

Pros: 
1. They will resume cruising this year. The CDC has been loosening restrictions with cyclical industries except for cruise lines. But with pressures on the CDC, they finally gave in.

2. Carnival survived through the pandemic even with no revenue coming in. Having no revenue should be enough to destroy a business right? Well not for Carnival, they survived and in fact their assets increased throughout 2020. Their assets increased by 18% on their balance sheet from November 2019 - November 2020.

3. It has been announced that fully vaccinated people don’t need to wear masks. This news just brings in more confidence that everything will soon be back to normal and that also means cruise lines will be back in action.

Cons:
1. COVID can mutate into something much worse. With the new mutation in India, there’s a possibility that in can spread across other countries. If that happens, cruising might be delayed even more and have to survive in their remaining cash.

2. Young Children are currently not allowed on cruises at the moment. Young Children are not able to take the COVID vaccines which are a requirement to board cruises. Families love going on cruises, but they will not be able to bring their little ones. So most likely Carnival would have to rely on the revenue coming from older folks/couples with upcoming anniversaries.

Overall, I’m bullish and have over 30 call contracts expiring this July 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-05-20 20:11:35,wallstreetbets,"Something to add to your DD.

I am sure it will run because people are fucking crazy, but the following is to keep in mind because correction will come, without a doubt, when common sense (ie fundamentals) kicks in:

Right before the pandemic was declared, they had 685M shares outstanding; the current number is at about 1,200M. Those shares were trading at $51.9 per share at its peak; today they closed at $27.53. That provides a market cap of $35.55B at the peak before the pandemic and $33.04B currently.

At the same time, long-term debt increased from $12.94B to $31.33B. Cash on hand as at Feb 28 was $11.51B, up from $9.51B. That provides the enterprise value of $38.98 before the hit and $52.86B currently. This is a very rough calculation and some numbers may be slightly different, but it isn’t far off.

So, while they lost $11.43B last year (and made about $3B the year before), market cap hasn’t significantly changed and enterprise value rose by a whooping $14B! Pretty sure everyone in their right mind understands that this is fucking insane.

This does not take into account that they will still be burning cash for the next few months, at least; and thus, issuing more shares or assuming more debt. Income prospects are also questionable for the foreseeable future for obvious reasons. For example, RCL’s CEO was talking about “favourable bookings” for 2022 (!). That was on the earnings call a couple of months ago (if I recall correctly).

Then add the green regulations that will come rather sooner than later since there were talks about it in not such a distant past and the current environmental concerns of the decision makers. That will require additional capital, which leads to more dilution and/or higher debt.

What I am saying is that it isn’t even remotely as bright as people are assuming it to be. Keep in mind that what I wrote above is really just the stuff on the surface and there is more shit to scratch. When the real market correction comes, cruise liners will be taking one of the biggest hits. When that correction comes is up for debate (not in the next few months, in my opinion, but I was wrong before). You should also keep in mind that they can dilute at any time and the last time they did was at the end of February; so we may be about due for another one, maybe not. Their next earnings call is on July 9, so that dilution may come before or right after, or not at all.

Good luck on your quest and hope the tendies will find their way to your gains."

2021-05-20 22:17:14,wallstreetbets,That would cause it to drop even lower.

2021-05-20 20:22:12,wallstreetbets,Nice job! T is awesome for cheap calls. Always buy puts on att after it runs. It never holds gains. Usually good for some quick $$ scalping options.
2021-05-20 23:36:44,wallstreetbets,Sure wish I could wrap my head around calls and puts...just dont get it...
2021-05-20 20:36:19,wallstreetbets,"Good job, now get off RH you retard"

2021-05-20 22:19:52,wallstreetbets,I have no idea how calls/puts work but that’s some nice gain porn!
2021-05-20 23:17:49,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit congrats, took some real balls on that dirtbag company."
2021-05-20 22:03:25,wallstreetbets,"Well played, I killed it on these too. I took home 5600% on $32 puts"
2021-05-20 23:37:55,wallstreetbets,Sure wish I could wrap my head around calls and puts...just dont get it?
2021-05-21 01:04:03,wallstreetbets,"I am dreaming of 10 baggers all the time. Thought I had it with GME, but I was too late, too greedy 🙃"
2021-05-21 12:02:33,wallstreetbets,Get off of RH . Why would you still use them?!

2021-05-21 14:40:54,wallstreetbets,Fuck you mean man if you think it’s going up buy call down buy puts.
2021-05-21 15:36:35,wallstreetbets,"The most important thing to know is that with calls you can only lose what you put in (if you buy $1000 of calls, you can go to zero). With puts, your losses can be INFINITE, because as long as the stock price goes up your losses increase. Puts are for big balls or small brains. I don't think I'll ever buy puts"
2021-05-20 20:21:31,wallstreetbets,These are puts retard
2021-05-20 22:33:46,wallstreetbets,I can't be certain but he mostly when T gapped up Tuesday morning after the deal with DISCA was announced.

2021-05-21 17:38:02,wallstreetbets,"I only see minus signs in my account, am I missing something?"
2021-05-20 21:05:19,wallstreetbets,"My goood man, how long have you had these pits?"
2021-05-21 16:40:06,wallstreetbets,"Wrong. 

If you BUY OPTIONS be it puts or calls the max you can lose is whatever you paid for the options. It's only when you SELL OPTIONS that your losses can be ""Infinite"" as you say."
2021-05-21 18:58:23,wallstreetbets,Selling Naked puts can have an infinte loss i believe. Cash covered puts limit your risk
2021-05-20 20:44:57,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂
2021-05-20 23:23:37,wallstreetbets,First clue most of the people here are super new.
2021-05-21 16:36:53,wallstreetbets,Actually this was the dividend news
2021-05-20 20:08:52,wallstreetbets,That’s dope
2021-05-20 21:06:03,wallstreetbets,"Holy snap. How often do you do this? Do you normally make money or lose?

Edit:  on average, are you making more money than you lose?"
2021-05-21 18:18:00,wallstreetbets,RobbedyouNood
2021-05-20 21:09:38,wallstreetbets,Are these not $32 puts?
2021-05-20 22:31:27,wallstreetbets,"That's rad!  Oh and I must be blind because I still don't see the AT&T at the top, but thanks for letting me know. Great gains man!!!  Nice job"
2021-05-20 23:31:35,wallstreetbets,I want to know how did you catch the momentum when it happened? Really congrats!
2021-05-21 14:23:16,wallstreetbets,Your name says don't message me but your comment says I'm friendly
2021-05-21 17:29:19,wallstreetbets,That’s what my wife’s boyfriend told me
2021-05-21 10:04:32,wallstreetbets,Prefer banging over bagging
2021-05-20 22:06:17,wallstreetbets,1 day
2021-05-21 17:24:08,wallstreetbets,"Selling options, or take a short position like a 🌈🐻"
2021-05-21 17:28:53,wallstreetbets,"Right...but you can't lose infinte on calls. Theoretically, it's puts that can cause infinte losses. With calls, your losses stop when the stock hits zero. With puts, your losses are caused by the stock going up, which is theoretically infinite. A stock can't go lower than zero. The distinction you make is important, but it doesn't make me wrong."
2021-05-20 22:45:30,wallstreetbets,You’re all fucking idiots
2021-05-20 21:09:30,wallstreetbets,Would also like to know
2021-05-20 21:47:57,wallstreetbets,I dont think you can
2021-05-20 23:03:50,wallstreetbets,"You can't buy AH options on stocks. Till 4:15 you can buy options on QQQ, SPY, DIA and indexes."
2021-05-20 23:24:55,wallstreetbets,"If he could do this consistently he would be a billionaire.

He cannot do this consistently."
2021-05-20 22:10:31,wallstreetbets,Why yes. Yes he does normally make money or lose it.
2021-05-21 00:13:28,wallstreetbets,And yes PLAY $SNAP tomorrow

2021-05-21 13:06:07,wallstreetbets,Wow reallyy
2021-05-21 17:40:30,wallstreetbets,"Bro, you're talking about shorting shares, not buying puts.

Buying puts is the same as Buying calls, but in the opposite direction."
2021-05-21 17:35:57,wallstreetbets,No. With a purchased put you can only ever lose what you paid. Same with purchased calls.
2021-05-21 00:57:02,wallstreetbets,"Lmao. You made my day. I was like, I wish we could trade options pre and post? I was confused at first as to how this thread went this far down."
2021-05-21 00:14:36,wallstreetbets,Well ive bee 3/4 5/6 of positive plays lately so hey cant complain on avg 3k a week not trying to brag or anything but i do this
2021-05-20 22:28:38,wallstreetbets,"Look dude, your wife’s boyfriend is looking for you and I rather not be bothered by your stupidity."

2021-05-20 20:25:57,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2021-05-20 21:24:34,wallstreetbets,"Weird. For puts, it’s usually premium + BE = strike. Must be losing my mind."
2021-05-20 22:35:32,wallstreetbets,"🤣 I'm definitely retarded! I now just realized that ""T"" is the ticket symbol for AT&T."
2021-05-21 14:24:56,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure I didn't pick my name because I take 0/7 days serious
2021-05-21 18:10:54,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-05-21 00:15:33,wallstreetbets,"Damn, that's nice. Maybe consider posting your trades here more often. 🤔"
2021-05-21 01:17:07,wallstreetbets,Hey can I get in on the profit? I’m new to trading but eager to learn
2021-05-21 19:01:38,wallstreetbets,Do you use scanners like trade ideas or are you shooting blind and hoping something sticks? Asking because i too want to be rich
2021-05-20 22:44:40,wallstreetbets,"Since when is wife having a boyfriend not a complement?

2021-05-20 22:45:46,wallstreetbets,If it makes you feel any “better” I’m a smoothed brained 🦍 that has no idea what puts/calls/strikes any other lingo besides buy and sell shares means and I even was able to figure out that “T” meant AT&T ticker. Just trying to make you feel better ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)
2021-05-21 00:15:58,wallstreetbets,Oh i will

2021-05-21 02:47:11,wallstreetbets,Appreciate it. Would’ve probably missed the reply and continued to think I was an idiot.

2021-05-21 00:56:24,wallstreetbets,I hate so much the swap of commas and periods in numbers. It’s so distracting. Can’t we all just use one form.
2021-05-20 23:33:58,wallstreetbets,How much is this in real money
2021-05-21 01:30:28,wallstreetbets,This screenshot only proves there is 35k euro in your account but doesn't proof you own gamestop at all?

2021-05-21 15:57:01,wallstreetbets,"Lending: you can't short US stocks on Degiro, which implies there's no lending (regardless of type of account). Also, as you can imagine, this is a FAQ in the Degiro sub, many have reached out to customer support asking this Q and got confirmation: no lending of US stocks. Even on Twitter.

Cheapest: ok, I should've said cheapest *European* broker as some 0% brokers like Etoro and Webull are also active in EU, but they're not European.
Why does it matter (to me)? Several EU countries have a *""financial transaction tax""* every time you B or S. Degiro will collect that tax on my behalf and pay it to the taxman, so I don't have to do it. I know other Euro brokers that also take care of it, but they're more expensive so..yeah.

Etoro and/or Webull might be a little bit cheaper but they lend out my US shares while not taking care of my transaction tax. Degiro is the cheapest *European* broker that takes care of both.

I stand by my point :)

Edit: custody is the type of account that doesn't allow lending and shorting.
Trader account will let you lend and short, still with exception of US stocks."

2021-05-21 00:31:55,wallstreetbets,Hope noone tries to steal them at the homeless shelter.
2021-05-20 22:57:05,wallstreetbets,"Do you know what calls are, or are you talking about shares on WSB?"
2021-05-21 00:38:36,wallstreetbets,"Someone gave you gold so I will answer. This is  two pictures showing multiple positions. 

Picture 1. He bought 33 7/16 300 calls. He is down 48K on them. He paid about 1500 for each of them. (Math). On expiration he needs gme to reach 315 to break even, or some IV magic before then. 

Picture 2. He has 928 shares and 6 more of the same calls. It doesn’t list if he’s up or down on those. What we know for certain, OP is both retarded and jacked to the tits. New home or homeless is very fitting."
2021-05-21 03:52:20,wallstreetbets,"Your house is worth 250k right now. Based on market conditions, I think it will be worth over 500k by mid-July. We enter into a contract where I pay you a couple thousand for the option, but not the requirement, to buy it at say 300k at any time between now and then. As the homeowner, you are betting against that much of a price increase, so you sell the option with the idea of pocketing that money and keeping the house. If, by the expiration date, the house is appraised at less than 300k, then it doesn't make sense for me to exercise the option and pay more than it's worth. Options are contracts where I pay an amount, far less than the price of the underlying asset, for the guaranteed option of buying it at an agreed upon price for a period of time."
2021-05-21 00:31:08,wallstreetbets,"I'll give it a shot. I am new too.

From the top: The date the call expires or can be exercised on.
The price ($300) the shares can be purchased for on that date.

The 9.25 is what their shares are worth right now per the calls value.

Position quantity of 33 is 33 calls worth 100 shares each. So 3,300 shares.

The cost is what they paid to buy these calls (someone else is putting their owned shares on the line at $300 on this date regardless of the current market value of the share). They paid $79,518.57 to buy the calls.

The value of their calls have dropped in value by $48,993.57 and are now worth $30,525. (3,300 shares times $9.25 =)

If on july 16, the shares are worth $350 each, he exercises his calls and buys 3,300 shares for $30 each and then can immediately turn around and sell them for $350-$300= $50 *3,300 shares = $165,000 - initial cost ($79,518.57) = $85,481.43 profit.

But more than likely selling the calls themselves would be worth more money perhaps at a time before or after it's hits $300.

Edit: there their

Edit2: I just saw the second picture"
2021-05-21 00:44:28,wallstreetbets,"If you want to keep your money, don’t attempt to understand. Just know that this position will be worth $0 by July."
2021-05-21 02:43:15,wallstreetbets,"Not gonna lie, I read this as APESEKS"
2021-05-21 01:00:07,wallstreetbets,if it got to $220 tomorrow he could sell the option for a grip of profit - but he has diamond hands so he will hold it until it expires worthless expecting it to moon the next day.
2021-05-20 22:20:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but technically breakeven is a little over 300 because you pay a fee (aka premium) to buy the options. Note this only applies if you actually exercise the option and buy the underlying shares. Also note that American style options it can hit >300 *anytime before* or up to 16 July.

You can also make money even if it never hits 300 by selling the call to someone else. If GME has a really good day (let’s say it goes to 200 tomorrow) then OP could probably sell the call for a profit, even though it’s nowhere near 300.

If this doesn’t make sense, google options greeks to learn more about how options are priced"
2021-05-20 22:15:49,wallstreetbets,"Anytime in between, but options are confusing af."
2021-05-20 22:19:25,wallstreetbets,Yes. If it goes above $300 he can exercise the option and buy 100 shares for every call at $300 a share.
2021-05-20 22:57:19,wallstreetbets,Yes. The closer  ITM. (Below current market price) the less the stock will have to move in order to break even.
2021-05-21 09:46:53,wallstreetbets,With premiums and such factored in he really needs it to be closer to 315 in order to make a profit.
2021-05-21 00:43:19,wallstreetbets,"Are ya kidding, it could easily stay at 175 that long the way things are going. Seems like a bad play. Why not buy shares."

2021-05-20 23:09:28,wallstreetbets,He’s down $0.25 on those and they are worth $9.25 at the moment of the screenshot so he purchased them for $9.50. His break even would be $309.50 at expiration

2021-05-20 23:29:59,wallstreetbets,"Do you know how to properly read a screenshot of a position, or are you fucking retarded"
2021-05-21 00:54:10,wallstreetbets,"Lmao thank you for the explanation. Tbh I didn't even know there was a second picture, so I'm still focused on the first. Just one follow up if you don't mind, when you said 315 for him to break even, do you mean it would need to reach 315 for him to be able to sell the contract ITM and break even? Because these contacts would cost 9.9m to exercise at the strike correct? So he likely has no intention of exercising, but selling the contract ITM for profit? Which is another thing I don't get, why would someone buy an ITM call? Okay maybe I should go over to r/options like the other guy suggested haha.  

Thanks again :)  

edit: okay now I'm realizing that by 315 to break even you probably meant for him to exercise (buy at 300) and then sell at 315. I'll go to r/options 🤪"
2021-05-21 09:00:56,wallstreetbets,"> He bought 33 7/16 300 calls. He is down 48K on them. He paid about 1500 for each of them. (Math)

$80k in net cost for the calls, and there's a total of 33 contracts. 

The cost per contract is about 80000/33 or about $2400. 

The loss per contract on the contracts he sold, provided he sold them at the price shown when he took that screenshot, would have been the 1500 (math) you said. It's just 50000/33.

The statement ""what he paid for them"" is kind of ambiguous. Especially since he locked in the loss on some of them and is still in the others. I don't know if it's worth a semantic argument about whether paying $2400 and earning $600 should be described as ""he paid $2400"" or ""he paid $1500"", but I wanted to be explicit for the benefit of u/RealSalte and also I wanted to type a bunch of numbers to fuck with the bots."
2021-05-21 02:35:20,wallstreetbets,"What I dont get is, pic 1 OP has 33 call 7/16 300, but in pic 2 he only has 6. Why would that be 6 more ? Fidelity would be showing the total number he has"
2021-05-21 01:01:11,wallstreetbets,"Hey thanks man. I think you did a really good job explaining this. Paired with the other guys explanation I think I really understand now! Just wanted to clear one thing up, when you say the cost of the shares currently 9.25, you're referring to the premium correct?"
2021-05-21 09:02:37,wallstreetbets,7/16 190 call options are going for his break even price.   He would need it to move 100 dollars to break even.   This position is completely fucked

2021-05-20 22:39:41,wallstreetbets,Generally earn 36% a year in returns on investments. First house our house fha 5k down 2 years later rolled to 15 year with no payment change since mip shaken off due to it going up like 50k in that time and lower interest rates basically evened out. Then year later rolled 30k into a conventional 2-4 unit mortgage. 15% down provided we take one of the two units as a primary for one year. Luckily with housing prices that died is valued 100k more than it was when we bought half that was we got is stupid cheap other is the 30% rise in home costs. We have half a million dollars in homes and less than 300k debt it's insane how things are right now. Have another 30k now to do it again but past few months haven't found anything near what I would want to pay anymore.

2021-05-20 23:37:08,wallstreetbets,Bold of you to assume he can read
2021-05-20 23:41:50,wallstreetbets,"I do not know how to read this position, Is it granting him the right to buy 6000 shares at 300$ each, so if the price goes above 300$ it's pure profit, otherwise it expires worthless? Or did he create a covered call and sell it to others, and if the price goes over 300$ he would lose all his stocks as someone else could then sell them for the excess value?"
2021-05-21 05:39:28,wallstreetbets,Tf do you mean? OP posted a screenshot of his calls and this retard starts talking about owning shares.
2021-05-21 01:19:19,wallstreetbets,"Break even is $315 because share price of $300+ the $15 per share ($1,500 per contract) premium that he paid

The $9.25 price you see in the first picture is the current premium for the contract, $9.25 per share so $925 per 100 share contract. That’s how much he could sell them for now, and the break even for the buyer would be $309.25"
2021-05-21 09:47:08,wallstreetbets,"Exercise / breakeven are about the same thing usually... unless the underlying assets would cost you a fortune to exercise (like in this case).

OP has 39 contracts of 100 shares each at a strike price of $300. (39 x 100 x 300)

He will need $1,170,000 to exercise all of these. So you're likely correct in that their goal is to sell them ITM for a profit. Which means GME has to go well above $315 for this retarded endeavour to be worth it."
2021-05-21 09:27:52,wallstreetbets,"You’re right, thank you!"
2021-05-21 02:22:48,wallstreetbets,"You are correct. He probably shouldn't have said ""shares"" because ""shares"" usually refers to stock, not options. $9.25 is indeed the current premium, ie the current price of the call options (quoted on a per/share basis, even though each contract is actually for 100 shares of the stock).

So basically, today, you could buy the same option contract (same strike and expiration date) for $9.25 that he paid $15 a while back. So why has premium (option price) gone down? For an OTM option, there's a few reasons:

1) Stock Price: the stock price hasn't moved up substantially. Obviously the closer it gets to $300 (or above), the more likely his call is to end ITM.

2) Time Decay: Time is ticking away. For an OTM contract, the more time remaining before expiration, the higher the chances are that the share price will make its way into the money before expiration. Think of it this way: what are the odds GME breaks $300 in the next day? Not good. What are the odds it breaks $300 during the next 5 days? Not good, but definitely higher. Maybe even 5 times higher? What are the odds it breaks $300 in the next 100 days? Definitely higher still (although probably still low). So the longer the time remaining on an option, the more likely the stock price will move before expiration, because it has more time available to move. Thus, as time ticks away, if the stock price isn't moving favorably (such as staying flat), then the value of the option is going to decrease. You can see this in the options chain. Options with expirations that are further out have higher premiums (more expensive).

3) Expected/implied volatility: If an option is currently OTM, the odds of it going ITM is also a function of the expected amount of volatility in the stock price. A stock price that is wildly bouncing all over the place certainly has a higher likelihood of moving far enough to get ITM than a steady stable boring stock price. The steady stable boring stock price is most likely to just stay where it's at (OTM in this case) and thus expire OTM (worthless). So, expected volatility affects premiums. So, if he bought the OTM calls when volatility was high, he paid a higher premium because that volatility increased the chances of his calls ending ITM. So now, if GME had flatlined and shows no signs of big moves in either direction, that will hurt the value of his options. On the other hand, if news leaked that a big board announcement is coming up, or perhaps an earnings release is coming up, or suddenly GME starts getting more attention again and the stock gets a lot more volatile, those would all increase expected volatility, which would cause his options to rise in value, since now there is a higher likelihood of a big stock price move that could put his options ITM before expiration.

So there you have it:
1) stock price relative to strike
2) time remaining until expiration
3) expected volatility

Changes in any of those will change the value of his calls."

I had bought just out of the money then the price dropped big time. I noticed those calls were going for super cheap and the price of the option would fluctuate by a few cents now and then. I start buying a shit load of calls on the down spike until I averaged down enough to be near the upper price fluctuation. Sold a few at around cost, then it actually rebounded and this time my premium avg was so low once they were near the money I had more than 3x my investment. I actually average down somewhat fairly often if I still believe in the outcome, but then again I'm not blowing money on weekly FDs."

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Tesla Model Y Is Spotted Testing LiDAR With Manufacturer Plates 
2021-05-21 04:24:41,wallstreetbets,"LIDAR simply allows the system to train and validate how well it works. For example the vision sees a certain type of object on the road and using the NN it determines what type of object it is and how far away it is located. You can then use LIDAR data to verify that it is calculating depth correctly, if yes then you are good, if not, then use the LIDAR depth info and the vision info to retrain the NN to correct the how depth is computed.

Basically, it helps the system label and validate data at the training level and has nothing to do with the cars being able to self-drive. This would be like saying that since a human is needed to help label data for self-driving systems (which every self-driving system so far requires) they cannot self-drive without a human, which is obviously ridiculous."

Firstly o researched the average penis size worldwide which was reported to be 5.16 inches when erect. Based on this I found out what the average height was in the swampy country of Rwanda, the data shows the average hieght is 5ft 2 inches. With this data I calculated that the average penis is 12.0155% of the human body in Rwanda.  
  
Using this data I searched up what is shreks height, the most common answer was 8ft (96 inches) based on the findings of my previous data I calculated that shreks dick is 11.53 inches.  
  
This lead to me wondering what Fiona (shreks wife) height was as she must have been ruined pre ogre transformation, based on my research she was 5.10 meaning that pre shrek transformation she was taking ogre dick account for over 19% of her height!"

It’s exhilarating how much money you can lose in a few minutes because you see DD with a 6000 page essay and you see that it has a lot of upvotes for validity. Thank you for the fun “memes” that you guys keep telling me how the squeeze is happening for 8 months. Thanks for giving your thesis on sectors that will undoubtedly go up due to news like semiconductor shortages or how a stock is severely undervalued based on their low PE and how it compares to the “best” stock in the industry trading 30x that. 

Love y’all"

When they get inside, Chris Hansen walks out dressed as a butterfly and asks them to “take a seat”.

He asks what they’re doing there today and they’ll stutter that they just came to talk to the young butterfly, so recently hatched from the nurturing chrysalis.

As they deny sexual intent, their words are interrupted by the soft sound of sugar water dripping from their dick and onto the kitchen tile...

The year is 2001. You’re at a Chinese restaurant.Your uncle puts extra walnuts in your portion of shrimp. Sweet !

The year is 2008. You're a kid at a Chinese restaurant with your family. While waiting for the food to come, you entertain yourself by looking at fish and prawns and crabs in their tanks. Life's good.

The year is 2019. You’re walking at night down a chilly city street when you see the glow of the Chinese restaurant that you used to go to with your family. You don’t know what comes over you, but you decide to go in. The waitstaff are different but the flavors are the same. It reminds you of a simpler time. And for a moment, you’re not alone anymore.

The year is 2056. You sit back at a big round table at a new Chinese restaurant after dinner, slightly tipsy. Around the table are your family. Your children, all grown up now and sitting close to their partners. Your grandchildren are chattering away, playing with toys in their laps. You never thought that you would get to this point, but here you are. You lean back in your seat and relax. Your belly is full, as is your heart. Finally.

The year is 2057. The dementia progressed rapidly. Who are these people anyway? Food

The year is 2058. Shjslabdn Dim sum

The year is 2059. Your family gathers around your casket, celebrating your life, remembering the days you spent together. They commune at the chinese restaurant your family has been going to for nearly 80 years. A cure for Alzheimer's was found 2 weeks later.

2021-05-20 20:52:47,wallstreetbets,"Tech is the most obvious buy in the market right now by far. Valuations in reopening stocks are getting absolutely ridiculous. Imagine investing in garbage like Build a Bear, which in 2019 had a revenue growth rate of 0.6% from 2018 to hit 338.5M revenue in 2019. Then in 2020 and they had 255.3M in revenue, or a -24% growth rate. Yet the stock is WAY WAY WAY higher than before pandemic and before Pandemic their growth rate was practically 0%. Now it is negative. Even if Build a Bear would regain its entire 2019 revenue the fair value of the stock is below $5. Don't listen to the news outlets pushing reopening socks so they can dump these massive bags on you. The market has Build a Bear style stocks everywhere right now. Look at SEAS it is the same story and its fair value is under $20 based on pre-pandemic revenue. These reopening stocks are priced to grow at 50-200% rates like tech companies and their historical growth rates are non-existent. There is no reason to believe they will achieve massive growth after the pandemic."

This is my interpretation of todays 8k

-In todays 8k they announced plans to buyback shares via treasury stock method?

-after the merger, discovery will buy/own 70% of all its stock/public float and existing discovery shareholders will own 30% via fully diluted basis

-the merger will be via reverse morris trust so HBO, CNN, and TBS etc will be spunoff and merged with discovery, thus creating a new company, as to avoid taxes?

Am I right or amirite?"

2021-05-20 21:02:51,wallstreetbets,"tech doesn't rely heavily on products like materials and resources like many of these others businesses. Remember prices of things are rising and tangible things are more expensive and intensive when it comes to capitalism. What is easier to manage? An app that or a company that needs a plethora of materials to build a bear and then ship all those materials into warehouses etc. etc. And one thing that apps can do or provide faster in terms of product or whatever is convenience. This is why the videogame industry is taking off because instead waiting for weeks or months for a the game to put on shelves people can avoid that and so can businesses and do it digitally. 

It is fair that some tech companies are overvalued and they are redundant but when it comes to convenience and time they are way ahead."

2021-05-20 22:09:35,wallstreetbets,No. This was bought about an hr before market close
2021-05-21 12:27:03,wallstreetbets,Genius TA. 416 support broke now. Waiting on the drop to 412 now. Wish I had your balls!!
2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I’m definitely a moron 
2021-05-20 22:47:42,wallstreetbets,Hey its only 7k after the loss allowance
2021-05-21 02:37:32,wallstreetbets,And tomorrow theta will take half of that premium just cause
2021-05-21 10:11:59,wallstreetbets,One of us

2021-05-20 21:17:43,wallstreetbets,This guy skipped the basics and dove straight into options. What a retard

2021-05-20 21:23:13,wallstreetbets,"Closed after hours at 415.83. OP better start praying to every god under the sun, because futures are rocketing."
2021-05-20 20:35:21,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, friend."
2021-05-20 21:47:58,wallstreetbets,Op is fine.  He only paid $1.23.  650 contracts.  He isn't losing too much man.
2021-05-20 21:24:35,wallstreetbets,Don't make me buy 420 calls again. I got flamed last time I did that.
2021-05-20 21:51:02,wallstreetbets,"Since when was $69k not too much? I guess to some it isn't, but he could've just given that money to me. At least I would've lost it all at a slower pace"
2021-05-21 00:05:11,wallstreetbets,Found the 1% lol
2021-05-20 21:52:27,wallstreetbets,He can just sell for maybe 50% loss tomorrow if he is lucky.  Or maybe break even or come out ahead.  Who knows.
2021-05-20 21:55:49,wallstreetbets,Of he gave you the money he loses on tax write offs.
2021-05-20 21:54:40,wallstreetbets,"Also remember someone or multiple people sold them those contracts.  Those people had good gains.  Op loses, others win.  So balances out."
2021-05-20 21:21:05,wallstreetbets,"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay liquid. You mightn't think the market is in a good state, but evidently more people do than don't, otherwise we wouldn't be seeing green days like these. There are plenty of good arguments as to why inflation worries are overblown, I'm on that side, but I'm sure there are just as many arguments to why it's not overblown."
2021-05-20 23:36:03,wallstreetbets,"My fears are coming from people  unloading everything they have expecting big paydays, losing it all and defaulting on their debt and that becoming a cascading effect."
2021-05-21 08:53:17,wallstreetbets,"We're not the real players in this market, we just watch. Those people looking for big paydays tend not to be rich, otherwise they'd have no reason to even want a big payday in most scenarios."
2021-05-21 09:47:41,wallstreetbets,"I was referencing defaulting on car payment, mortgage, rent.  Not big players.  Just a bunch of people being told that micro corn will one day soon become the same price as big corn, so they keep tossing more in."

2021-05-21 00:04:46,wallstreetbets,"You know that in 2020, about 85% of the companies (from a report) had more votes than the issued shares? Statistically you're absolutely wrong to claim that."

2021-05-20 21:27:00,wallstreetbets,"They only hold like 700k AMC shares and that's literally nothing. They're probably short a hundred times that.

2021-05-21 00:11:43,wallstreetbets,It's supposed to be one vote per shareholder of record. So you'd expect no more votes than the total number of shares unless a clearing house made a mistake.
2021-05-21 02:10:16,wallstreetbets,Why is it not set as an 18+ community then?
2021-05-21 02:11:41,wallstreetbets,"You actually think I _show_ this shit to a 4 year old lmao? No, I have the volume on and im sitting beside my brither who is watching tv. Could you not even think for one second? Jeez"
2021-05-21 00:33:14,wallstreetbets,Zactly
2021-05-21 01:23:20,wallstreetbets,Depending on your broker they should have emailed you with proxy vote information. If you broker is Robinhood you should contact them immediately for voter information. They seem to be not sending out the votes. And you should get off of Robinhood
2021-05-21 13:43:58,wallstreetbets,"If you don't vote it won't be counted. Not voting is a disservice if you are a GameStop share holder. That is why there is such a heavy push to vote. Most companies proxy votes are not accounted for. Most people don't care or simply ignorant to what the company they are invested in are doing. Now with GameStop you have maybe millions of people owning 1-10 shares. There are people like me and others with hundred and some thousands of shares. If the thesis is correct and more votes come in than shares it legitimately proves naked short selling. Which in the USA is a crime, while usually overlooked in this instance I would speculate it would not be. Regardless of your take the GME phenomenon is extremely interesting. If you're holding vote, if you're not enjoy the show!"
2021-05-21 07:48:47,wallstreetbets,Thank science!
2021-05-20 21:41:41,wallstreetbets,The point isn't to shift current positions to new ones like is the point usually. The point now is to vote to show that you voted at all. The record of you votings counts as direct evidence that there are more synthetic stocks than real stocks which proves our suspicions. So vote. Doesn't matter what you vote unless you really have an educated opinion on what your voting for. Just vote if you can.

2021-05-21 07:08:09,wallstreetbets,Then I really don’t know what you are crying about??  If your brither wasn’t watching it what’s the big deal?  There was no audible profanity.  Do you think he could actually comprehend what was happening in the scene?  Sounds like YOU didn’t think for one second that you wouldn’t get ripped apart for complaining about your brither’s virgin ears on a WSB chat thread.  You must have never been on 4chan then...So do you normally watch South Park with the volume on with your brither sitting next to you??  I’m just more confused now.  😰
2021-05-21 01:25:38,wallstreetbets,So there needs to be more info like this and less memes... thank you

2021-05-20 20:40:19,wallstreetbets,"I don't think that's true, in fact I think (pretty certain after watching the stock drop in March twice) there may be far more now unreported."

2021-05-21 14:02:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah there is pretty much no reason not too. It just seems as if RobinHood is not sending out the ballots/proxy material which is why I urge to contact them if you have shares and haven't been able to vote.
2021-05-21 15:31:36,wallstreetbets,Yes I believe you had to own shares back in March/April.
2021-05-20 21:50:52,wallstreetbets,"no its not, its only recorded and counted if you fill out your proxy form you can get from your brokerage"
2021-05-21 18:45:50,wallstreetbets,Why would you default to thinking this? Did you just assume something and categorize it as fact in your head? You must be a fucking handful in real life.

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My first time playing around with options using BNGO.  So this is the first time I've ever played around with options and I'm probably doing it in a dumb way but get that's more fun for you guys to watch. I have 200 shares in BNGO with an average price of about $6 and I decided to sell 2 calls for $358 premium with a strike price of $12 expiring in January, 2023. Now I believe in BNGO and I think it could go to the moon. But I might have to stay on earth while I watch the rocket fly. My goal is to grow a dividend portfolio to pay me some good dividends while I'm a full time student and don't work a job currently. So here's what my current play is:

I sold those 2 calls for the $358 premium. If those calls get exercised I am perfectly fine with cashing out $2,400, which is roughly a $1,100 net profit off my original investment of $1,300. That $2,400 will very much go towards buying some great monthly dividend stocks. But I also decided to make another play to make things interesting.

I also decided to sell 1 put for a premium of $38 with a strike price of $5 expiring on June 18 of this year. I think BNGO can stay above that but even if it doesn't, I'm more than happy to buy 100 more shares. If I get assigned, I'll only have to pay $104, which I'm fine with.

So in summary, I could have a short term gain of $396 if the put expires worthless or a net loss of only $104 if BNGO closes under $5 on June 18. But even if I get assigned, I could always sell another $12 January 2023 covered call for those 100 for roughly \~$160, meaning I could still end up making a small profit when all is said and done. I have no idea if there's a name for this ""strategy"", if you can even call it that, or if I'm just a moron lol.

2021-05-21 06:51:10,wallstreetbets,Imo it would be better to do something like selling August $9Cs for $90 premium each. If they don't get assigned you can keep rolling them over to net more premiums and your not locked into an immovable trade for 2 years
2021-05-20 23:16:36,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t actually do the math but yeah you’re right, if the underlying tanks then there is downside risk for sure.   I was kind of assuming flat to up based on the underlying being widely regarded as a strong buy and $14 pt, but there are no guarantees so you’re right it is a faulty assumption in reality for any stock.  

Realistically I believe that BNGO is in the stages of wide adoption and will soon begin to realize consumables revenues in a big way, and my personal price target is around $22 in 3 years.

2021-05-20 23:10:08,wallstreetbets,"Well even if I have to shell out $100, I can always sell another covered call on those shares and gain roughly $160-$180, gaining back my $100 and still coming out with a profit."
2021-05-20 23:21:39,wallstreetbets,"I’m bullish on bngo and working to continue accumulating, so if it dips down I like to sell csp’s against it.   If it goes up again I buy them back cheaper and make money, and if it dips below the strike I get assigned shares and keep the premium.   Typically I’ll sell $5 strike puts when it’s in the $4’s, so they’re ITM at time of sale and usually valued around $1 or so.   If it doesn’t recover then I’ll be assigned with a cost basis of ~$4, but so far it has recovered each time and once the short puts are OTM I’ll just take the profit on a Green Day.  Boring, but whatever.   It’s a great way to build a position IMO but takes time and risks letting the underlying run up before a position is established.   I usually just hold the profits from csp’s and try to DCA into more shares.

Personally I’m hoping to get assigned at some point to get the shares, but it’s hard to complain about profit in this market.  If you try this strategy make sure to remember the taxes, it’s not all profit and Uncle Sam wants his cut.   There’s no reason to necessarily buy the puts back when it runs up, I just do it to secure profits, and wait for another red day to sell a new one."

If the put gets exercised then that means I have to buy the shares at the strike price, which is $5x100. I gained $396 in premium from both the covered calls and selling the put, which means the most I can ""lose"" is $104 of my own money. But because I believe in BNGO, I won't mind having to buy 100 shares if the put gets exercised."

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PUBM DD #1  

A little bit about myself for context:

1. I work in enterprise mergers and acquisitions.
2. I've been an armature securities analyst for about 6-7 years now.
3. I'm careful about where I put my money. Pubmatic is a compelling investment, so lets get into it.

What is Pubmatic?

* Pubmatic was founded in 2006 and operates in programmatic digital advertising market. They are generally considered an old school adtech company by much of the adtech community. In a nutshell, their platform-as-a-service provides tools to help connect publishers to advertisers so that they can sell ads. Pubmatic is known as an ""SSP"" or supply-side-platform. Supply being ad inventory on a publisher's website. Advertisers looking to purchase ad inventory will work with their own demand-side-platform or ""DSP"" and the whole transaction happens automatically. This has advantages over simply calling up a publisher and purchasing the ads in person. Namely speed and data analytics that these platforms have. Keep in mind that I am no expert in adtech whatsoever. Here is a high level info graphic:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/555339dhob071.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=42585b1cfe4cf1c85eab62b0cc01791f5321f1e2

* I would encourage you to look into this further, as it is quite interesting and fun to learn about.

The SSP Market:

* Unlike the DSP side of the equation, the SSP market is highly saturated and commoditized. I've found dozens and dozens of SSP competitors and they generally sell the same ad inventory. Publishers often times will work with many different SSPs to sell their inventory in an effort to capture as much revenue as possible. This has led to the saturation of the market and you see publishers sometimes working with 10-20 SSPs at a time. So how does an SSP compete?

The competition:

* There are a few different ways SSPs can compete with one another. Technology and scale are the two that come to mind. If an SSP has sophisticated analytics or advanced features, it's an easier sell to publishers. Additionally, if an SSP can operate at a large scale, they can get a higher percentage of the ad dollars flowing to the publishers, and can provide better fees. Pubmatic is the 3rd largest SSP behind Google and Magnite\* (**fact check needed**).
* The biggest players in this market are Google, Facebook, and Amazon. These are obviously some heavy hitters and they control a majority of the internet. They are often called ""walled gardens."" Think about youtube ads for example. Google simply sells their own youtube ads using their own adtech installations, no need for Pubmatic. They can also buy ads from themselves and put Google ads on youtube. So they play both sides of the market. It is extraordinarily difficult to compete with them since they are basically the government of the internet and control a mind-blowing amount of personal data on each and every one of us. However, the ""open internet"" is still very much alive and growing, and this is where Pubmatic competes.

History lesson section: I'll need to do some more research on the history of the programmatic ad market and I'll post it in the next DD. Historical context is important to the story. Basically though, the digital advertising market is constantly going through dramatic shifts. If you look back, Pubmatic has grown resilient based on the fact that they've needed to reinvent their products a few times over. Some examples are the rise of header bidding, and most recently the sunset of the 3rd party cookie in Chrome. This is why Pubmatic doesn't hold any debt. Their revenue stream is sensitive to market shifts.

Pubmatic's Moat:

1. I don't have much insight into the competitive advantages of Pubmatic over other SSPs, but I can definitely say that there is some kind of moat.  

   1. First:  

      1. Pubmatic's net dollar based retention rate is 130%, up from 121% last year. That tells me that for one reason or another, more ad dollars are flowing through their platform. This is probably due to the SPO deals that they've been cutting, or ""supply path optimization."" These deals cut out a number of the existing SSPs that a publisher works with, and drives up market share for Pubmatic. They've been making these deals for a while now and it's a big growth driver. Smaller SSPs are going to suffer, but Pubmatic is big and a beneficiary of this phenomenon.
   2. Second:  

      1. Management describes their competitive advantage as being an ""infrastructure first"" company. This is unique - they own their own infrastructure rather than operating on something like AWS. I'll get into their financials later, but I like this part of their business. Magnite and many other SSPs operate on AWS, so they're giving a portion of their revenue to Amazon, who also competes with them. So you can see how that's a problem. Also, by owning their own infrastructure, Pubmatic can engineer their way to better outcomes for the publishers and advertisers. They are still working on this, but theoretically, they could offer lower prices and faster speeds. They aren't there yet, however. Take a look at their cost per ad impression:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kffnxp4gob071.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=db940e67eaabd3471afac9b2d50c7765744964ed

A nice downtrend on the costs. This is the benefit of the infrastructure first approach.

And yes, the T on the left is TRILLION. They deliver trillions and trillions of ad impressions every month.

1. One final note on the moat: creating a moat in the SSP market is notoriously difficult, but somehow Pubmatic seems to have found one. I would love to hear more from someone experienced in this space to help me understand better. A lot of the adtech community describes Pubmatic as ""generic"" or ""not interesting,"" but the numbers tell a much different story. Lets get into that next.

Pubmatic product and revenue mix - This will be in the next post.

1. High level:  

   1. Mostly mobile ad sales
   2. omnichannel - meaning they can sell inventory across multiple channels (desktop, CTV, mobile, etc)
   3. One note about CTV  

      1. Linear TV (boomer style cable television) is going by the way side in favor of connected tv, or CTV. CTV is compelling because there are no walled gardens controlling the market, so it is all up for grabs. Competition is quickly heating up between the likes of Disney, Roku, Fubo, Magnite (through Spotx M&A), and others. Pubmatic has a CTV implementation, but they were late to the party. That said, they already have the necessary tech to compete in CTV, so now it's just a matter of selling it. They'll need to work harder though to steal market share from competitors.

Financial condition:

1. This is the part that gets *very* interesting. Pubmatic's financial condition is really something special:  

   1. 18.5% GAAP net profit margin for 2020
   2. 32% EBITDA margin
   3. Zero debt
   4. 73% Gross profit margin
   5. 7+ years of positive free cash flow

These type of numbers clearly say that there is something here. Nothing about these numbers is ""generic."" If Magnite's products are so much better and if Magnite is a ""market leader"", why are they losing market share and not growing organically? Why are their margins worse even though they have a larger scale? Why haven't they been able to achieve high profitability? Seems to me that Pubmatic isn't so ""generic"" after all. But again, **I am not an expert in adtech**, so please please fill me in if you know more.

Revenue and margins have been increasing nicely over the last 3 years, even with the COVID headwinds. Management has indicated a long term revenue growth rate of 20%. I'll make another post later with a more detailed financial analysis and valuation (hint: it's higher than 1.6 billion).

I want to stress how unusual it is for a growth stock IPO to have such a high level of profitability. Often times with IPOs, the company has to go out and prove that they can make it, or that they can grow into profitability. Pubmatic is already in a more mature state and path the higher risk phase of posting losses (Magnite is still 1-2 years away from profitability, that makes it more speculative)

""The next Trade Desk"" - I've heard this before. Bottom line: the SSP and DSP markets are different. There is no ""next trade desk"" The trade desk is leading the charge against the walled gardens, and no SSP will take that place simply because they aren't right in front of the advertisers. Advertisers pay for the internet, not publishers. That said, Pubmatic has high profit margins and growth rates, very similar to TTD.

Short interest:

1. Most people seem to be the most interested in this part, which is understandable. I find the above more compelling myself, but lets get into it :)  

   1. Public float:  

      1. \~7 million shares
      2. Yes you heard that right, just 7 million shares are available for purchase. It's not a mistake.
   2. Institutional ownership  

      1. North of 90%
      2. This is what makes the public float so small
   3. Short percentage  

      1. North of 50%
      2. This is not a mistake, it really is that high
      3. What's more, it seems like there is **just one fund shorting this stock**. Northern Lights Trust Fund II (**fact check needed**, I looked into their SEC filings, but I couldn't find where the short sales were shown)
   4. Speculation time:  

      1. **Tin foil hat activated**: Magnite is the primary competitor to Pubmatic. By almost every measure, Pubmatic is a better company. Wouldn't it make sense to coordinate with a fund to drive down the price of Pubmatic? If they didn't short to such a high degree, my guess is that Pubmatic would have an equal or higher market cap than Magnite even with less revenue. That would be very embarrassing for Magnite, so they need Pubmatic's price to struggle. And why not? With such a low float and low volume, it wouldn't be hard for a short seller to be in control of the price. I have half a mind to message management and find out what they plan to do about this. Why would a short seller short Pubmatic to such an intense degree? How could a smaller company (pubmatic) with better profitability, better margins, and better organic growth rates trade at a LOWER multiple than Magnite? Is SpotX really that good? What if the Disney contract falls through? Magnite is a good company, but I see red flags all over. Doesn't make much sense. **Tin foil hat deactivated**

Risks:

1. The adtech industry is constantly shifting and management will need to be nimble enough to roll with the changes or some other company is going to eat their lunch.  

   1. Rebuttal:  

      1. Pubmatic operates with a high level of efficiency and doesn't hold any debt. Their engineering team in India is crazy efficient. I have worked with similar teams in the past.
      2. Again, Pubmatic has been growing their revenue and profit margins for a long time. I think they understand that it is important to maintain a certain level of nimbleness.
2. The oligopolistic internet super powers (I.e. Google) figure out a way to crush them  

   1. Rebuttal  

      1. This is a risk, but they haven't been successful in crushing Pubmatic so far. In order to do this, these walled gardens would need to own the whole advertising market on the internet. This is a very low risk. The open internet isn't going anywhere.
3. Ad dollars drying up  

   1. Pubmatic is totally and completely at the mercy of advertisers spending money on their platform. If they stopped spending due to some unforeseen issue (global economic meltdown), they lose reveune  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. We saw a huge drop off in ad dollars in Q2 2020 during the initial stages of the pandemic. Nevertheless, Pubmatic grew their revenue, so they've shown they can still compete even with this type of headwind.
4. Transparency  

   1. This is a weak point for Pubmatic. Transparency is becoming a hot ticket item. Advertisers are becoming more and more sensitive to where their ads get placed. For example: a family theme park isn't going to want their ads displayed on a porn site because it can damage their brand. They also want to defend against ad fraud, or when a bot clicks on an ad but obviously doesn't buy anything. Why would an advertiser want to pay good money for an ad if a bot is going to click it?  

      1. Rebuttal:
      2. Pubmatic needs to work on this. They have a fraud program that is available on all of their products, where they provide a refund if fraud is detected. So that is good, but I think they can do more. Pubmatic is incentivized to sell as many ads as possible, even to bots. I'm not sure what else they could do, but I think this could be a good selling point. I know that they've been giving more visibility into the data to publishers and advertisers, so that is good. Again, I think they could do more on this. That said, they aren't having any trouble selling their products, so maybe this isn't too big of an issue. At the very least, management mentions it all the time so they are aware of the concerns from advertisers.

That's it for now. **Please feel free to poke holes in the DD so far**. I consider DD to never be complete and I try to have a scientists perspective, where my conclusions are adjusted with new evidence. I have more to post, so please bear with me as I am very busy."
2021-05-20 20:52:08,wallstreetbets,Promising DD and company looks pretty good on paper. Why do you think it’s dropped so much in the past month ?
2021-05-20 22:57:04,wallstreetbets,"so glad someone over on Reddit understands Pubmatic and did a thorough DD on them. I invested heavily into this. The management looks sharp. I really came away impressed with their growth and pulled all of my capital out of Magnite and deployed into Pubmatic. Magnite will continue to be fintwit darling because there is a Wedbush analyst who had called it a TTD in the making, which I thought was horse sheet. Pubmatic's margins are great and the fact that they are profitable puts them in a niche category of IPOs right along with Good Rx, Zoom Info, Olo, etc. I am continuing to accumulate shares on weakness. I see them being a $10B company in the next 5-10 years. They hired away Spotify executive to take care of CTV business and then hired another lady from Disney Hulu. IMO they are doing the right things. The market may not have realized the potential of this company but I can tell you that I'll be rich when the market realized that Pubmatic is a great business. This stock can go parabolic like Upstart IMO."

From the \~50% short ratio, I'm assuming \~50% of the shares are currently being shorted. Due to the relatively low amount of shares being traded, it would be hard to buy back all at once.

 Assuming the above is correct, my question would be if the short sellers wanted to buy back what they shorted, it would be very hard without pushing the price up a lot I believe. In my opinion, this could lead to a very dangerous bubble for this stock. Do you think this scenario is plausible?

2021-05-20 20:58:22,wallstreetbets,We saw big price action in March for some reason. Could have been a mini squeeze since their Q4 earnngs might have caught short sellers off guard.

2021-05-21 09:42:08,wallstreetbets,I'm going to make a valuation post but I estimate it to be worth somewhere between 2.4-5  billion by the end of the year
2021-05-21 10:40:56,wallstreetbets,"I primarily look at evidence that a company is growing and profitable and trading at a reasonable valuation. At first glance, Viant looks like it has nice profitability, but I would need to understand why their revenue and profit margins are fluctuating. I like a company that is steady and predictable. Nice smooth revenue growth rate, smooth profit margin increases, and smooth cash earnings increases. Not saying Viant is bad, you just need to have a strong thesis. Viant valuation looks somewhat reasonable to me at the moment. Tangible book value is increasing well, but still very low. I would also need to understand why they are spending so much money. Looking at their income statement, what is ""other operating expenses?"" Why did they spend 89 million on that in the last 12 months? Looks like they also spend a ton on the sales team. Are they investing enough in R&D? Are they investing for the future properly? Look at the number, they will tell you everything you need to know."

2021-05-21 10:32:24,wallstreetbets,and what is the stock price  that equates to that in normal circumstances? or what is the fair stock price in your eyes considering their growth currently?
2021-05-21 13:27:31,wallstreetbets,I can say that IPOs typically don't get options chains until after a few months in the market. I would probably bet they'll be available before too long.

2021-05-21 09:50:10,wallstreetbets,Not too convinced; I feel another flight delay because of the dicy weather; they literally picked one of the worse times (weather-wise) to do this test flight…
2021-05-21 12:06:00,wallstreetbets,SPCE is being manipulated for calls expiry.  Should have easily seen 22-25 prior to the test flight.  5-6 1.5K walls on each side
2021-05-21 14:40:31,wallstreetbets,"If by rocket you mean crash and burn then yeah it is going to the moon, Spce is a 5 year - 10 year hold stock minimum"

2021-05-20 22:47:04,wallstreetbets,"Chamath sold his personal stake - he's still got millions indirectly through his companies.

Branson sold less than 10% of his stake in a move he announced last year to redirect funds to his business that were hit harder by the pandemic.

You might want to do 5 minutes of research before speaking up."

2021-05-21 07:49:37,wallstreetbets,"I think that’s backwards. These suborbital flights are more like 20 minute Disney rides. They don’t even match the Mercury program from the 1950s.

The real ballers are starting to buy orbital rides on Dragon and Soyuz. That’s an adventure you can one up everyone with.

And if SpaceX Starship works, suddenly the real adventure is available for the same price as suborbital flights. If that happens Virgin and Blue see all their suborbital business vanish overnight."

2021-05-20 23:28:31,wallstreetbets,Who the fuck wants to pay for 200k to see the thin line of space for like a minute and come back. It’s like being on the worlds most expensive rollercoaster. It’s cheaper to get a hot air balloon and go up just as high like Felix Baumgartner except you come back down with ballon instead of jumping off.
2021-05-20 20:29:12,wallstreetbets,You do know there design requires essentially new engine ( hence you don’t use hybrid engines) after every flight and costs around 300k..
2021-05-21 11:08:29,wallstreetbets,Figure out who “runs” the company then maybe folks will give a shit about what you have to say. But still likely not.

So SI gives you the net full story of where the market is positioned, vol just gives you half the story (how many were added not how many were closed)."
2021-05-21 01:45:23,wallstreetbets,You're underestimating the level of income inequality on this planet. Walk buy a true high limit room in Vegas and you'll have some idea of the people that would be on that ride. $200k is nothing for an experience that most of humanity will never have access to.

2021-05-21 08:14:20,wallstreetbets,speculating is a form of investing your money. It is an investment of one's money in a speculative asset with an emphasis on volatility and the playing of volatility in one's favour.

2021-05-21 08:12:41,wallstreetbets,"that is and was my exact point. i literally said that exact same thing in my last comment. They are **not** attempting to be a proper aerospace company. They never were trying. This is the worlds most expensive and thrilling Disney ride. It is why the company is full of ex-disney employees. Geez. When this company starts flying people on their ride up into the edge of space on a consistent basis, they will have accomplished goal #1 and the company will be hyper-successful and our investments will rise. This is why we are all here....anyone analyzing the science and comparing it to a rocket ship has missed the entire point and is a dolt."

2021-05-20 22:48:04,wallstreetbets,"Years ago, I remember showing up at an airport far from home, going to the Hertz kiosk, and being told the car I'd reserved and paid for had been given to someone else.  They were waiting for turn ins to resupply back to the waiting crowd.

Meanwhile their ""premium"" gold line, kept on moving and getting cars.

At which point I remembered, technically I was a premium gold club member as a perk from work.  Got my car in minutes.  But still years later never got over the fuckery of selling something they couldn't deliver.

There are few moments more satisfying, then watching a business that f'd over its customers on the regular going bankrupt.  But I am also overjoyed for those that managed to make a bit of profit on their bankruptcy.  Like dancing on a grave.  Good show."
2021-05-20 22:51:15,wallstreetbets,"Im confused if that’s chapter 11, which I think is a type of bankruptcy, wouldn’t shorting stock for a company that won’t exist for a long time be the option? 



Conversely if a company is going under and then gets bought out like this would I need to payback those shorted shares?"
2021-05-20 20:53:25,wallstreetbets,"Don't believe me? Here's Hertz telling you itself: ""We also expect our stockholders' equity to decrease as we use cash on hand to support our operations in bankruptcy. Consequently, there is a significant risk that the holders of our common stock will receive no recovery under the Chapter 11 Cases and that our common stock will be worthless."" That's according to Hertz in its 10-Q for the period ended Sept. 30, 2020p"

2021-05-20 21:07:37,wallstreetbets,"Serious question, I held a small amount of shares at some point (think I bought early March) and sold a few weeks later, however I recieved the same docs from my brokerage. Am I still getting paid. 

Full disclosure - I am but a simple ape, and I just fling my money around with little real idea of what I'm doing. It's a casino right?"

2021-05-20 21:32:26,wallstreetbets,"MOST bankruptcies. By most, I mean almost all. The while reason you file is that your can't pay your debts & usually that means equity = $0.00 and debt some value between $0 and $1 (full repayment on a different timescale). This is a miraculous outcome for equity holders."
2021-05-20 21:43:15,wallstreetbets,First bankruptcy? You’re getting squat pal and any securities you do get will be held at a transfer agent...which means they can’t be traded. Good luck

2021-05-21 14:28:06,wallstreetbets,"sort of.   Basically you go to the company you owe money to and say ""I'm going to declare bankruptcy. I'll give you X and you eat the rest or you get in line with everyone else and see if you can even get paid X from the scraps"".   Many times companies will take that small payment as it's better than nothing.     After that the company managed to pay everything and have left over money.  Their credit rating will be toast but that doesn't matter as whoever bought them already has their own credit rating and doesn't care about the old dead companies rating."

2021-05-21 11:16:10,wallstreetbets,Cars are currently valuable right now. Remember that not many are being produce because of resources and scarcity.
2021-05-21 09:51:46,wallstreetbets,I'd be interested to know how many cars they actually have now. A lot of rental companies sold off big portions of their fleets during the pandemic to mitigate costs and recoup some losses.

Another point of interest is that the SlowRSI is currently @ 33.29. Typically a bottom is put in when this reaches the 20 level or below. This itself is no reason for a pullback, but everything said put together strengthens the pullback argument.

All said and done, I am bullish on AAPL but believe we need to see a deep pullback in order for it to be more attractive to the masses and drive more volume into the stock. After this potential pullback I can see AAPL rallying hard to the upside, so pay attention and be patient for a good entry."

\*\*\*My average in @ $5.10, currently at $5.52, May 20th, 2021

I am not investing in the company as a get-rich-quick scheme, but plan to hold long term. **Saphyr** technology will continue to improve directly with design improvements, but also indirectly with the data that it continuously collects will create more accurate correlations of DNA with individual predispositions for disease. 

I believe the technology will allow for a more personal approach in the field of medicine, and should not be viewed solely as a research-based company.  

Recent earnings showed it was being stunted by large laboratory facilities having covid restrictions. The future increase in revenue will be reflected by the number of consumables the company sells. These consumables are required for every iteration the Saphyr Machine conducts. More machine sales lead to more consumables used, and in turn, will create the ability for cheaper future consumable production and ultimately greater and more feasible adoption of technology throughout the scientific and medical community. 

* **Large institutional investments have nearly tripled (3X) from 5% to 14%.** 
* **Earnings beat expectations in Q1 2021.**
* **Recent large insider procurement.**
* **New patents, research breakthroughs, Large Lab facility adoption.**

This is why I have a strong conviction for **Bionano Genomics (BNGO)** being a great growth stock to investigate and follow. 

There are some negative indicators fundamentally, but considering Bionano is still in its infancy I am very optimistic in my outlook. The positives tip the scale in my opinion and at the very least, Bianano Genomics (BNGO) should be on your watchlist!

In this post I'm going to not talk about some kind of currency that can get this post removed. Hint: it crashed big time yesterday. You know the one.

There is a new kind of this currency that uses a lot of computer storage space. How much? Well - 7 EXABYTES and it's currently adding 1 exabyte every 3 days. I'm going to assume you know about this currency and if not you can look through my post history and see which subreddit I've posted to recently involving this particular one.

#Topics of discussion:

* Why WDC is going to moon in the next 2-12 weeks

* WDC Fundamentals

* Bear case

#If you are reading this on May 20th - you are early

WDC just came off one of their best earnings beats in recent memory. WDC was a beaten-down stock in 2018 after NAND (SSD memory) prices declined, and analysts thought that HDDs (spinning disk hard drives) were going the way of the dinosaur. WDC did see a big increase in data center sales and consumer devices (think external drives for work from home setups) during Covid, but analysts priced in declining sales in 2021 as covid restrictions begin to end. By all accounts, it looked like WDC had no future growth prospects and should be some kind of dividend-yielding boomer stock. WDC reported earnings in April for the quarter ended March 31 - with revenues down only 1% compared to the 20% that analysts expected. The EPS was way higher than expected - non-gaap was expected to be around 0.68, and WDC delivered 1.02. The analysts are already wrong and they don't know what else is coming: The new currency thing that I won't name. They didn't even mention it in the earnings call. None of the investors on the line in the Q&A even asked about it. It's totally under the radar. In the next quarter, WDC is going to deliver their biggest earnings beat ever, and they are going to raise their revenue guidance for the rest of the year as a result, possibly by a gigantic, unheard of margin due to the new demand caused by the currency. When this happens, this stock is going to test its ATHs at around $110 per share but I would not be surprised to see a new ATH far above anything in the past. This stock can double, and it's going to happen AT THE LATEST during WDC's next earnings call. This is expected first week of August. 

#Fundamentals

WDC is an American company, they have been publicly traded since 1973 and they have been part of the S&P 500 index since 2009. This is a solid company - we are not betting on dog shit turning to gold, we are betting on gold turning to diamond. WDC has like 64k employees, and is vertically integrated in HDDs and SDDs thanks to a long road of acquisitions like SanDisk in 2016. They own their own supply chain, so they can make bigger margins in the event of the inevitable price increases reminiscent of the GPU market thanks to another currency.

WDC is close to fairly valued at the moment at about $70 per share. They saw some spikes to 75+ recently after earnings but it keeps selling off due to WDC suspending their dividend and boomers wanting out, plus S&P indexes falling and selling off here and there. Suspending the dividend is MAJOR good news. This company has been stagnant for a while, but they are ready to expand. They want to be a growth company again, and they are going to get it when they realize increased HDD and SSD demand is here to stay.

#The new reality is not priced in: WDC's TAM market just increased 50% and nobody knows about it

An industry expert at Forbes, Tom Coughlin, has estimated that WDC shipped 125 exabytes of HDD storage for Q1 2021. Next quarter, they are expected to ship around the same amount. WDC says there is seasonality but I really don't see it in the numbers. WDC owns somewhere about 35-40% of the HDD market, and around 17% of the SSD market.

The new currency is currently at 7 exabytes and consumes around 300+ petabytes daily at this point. Even after yesterday's events, the profitability is so high that even if it loses 50% of it's value, it's still worth buying HDDs over MSRP. Farmers can buy HDDs at $50 per TB (double the msrp market rate before the rise) and break even in 1 month. This is unheard of in the space. That's how profitable this is. While it's hard to farm solo if you are a small time farmer, it's worth it for the whales and the whales will eat HDDs until a 8TB drive goes for $400. WDC and Seagate are selling every drive they they can possibly make. If we apply WDC's market share to the current size of the network, we are looking at, conservatively, 2.5 exabytes of extra sales that is not expected or accounted for. 

Let's look at it another way - with 125 exabytes shipped in Q1, 90 days, that means WDC ships 1.38 exabytes daily. Half of this goes to datacenter clients in long-term contracts, so say 700 petabytes daily. If the new currency is growing at 300 petabytes daily, and 40% of those drives are WDC, that's an extra 17% more demand than anyone so far knows about. If that doesn't seem like a lot, it's because it's massively understated and not nearly as high as it is in reality.

The network space is a lagging indicator. People buy hard drives ahead of time, and fill them with plots over time. Plotting speed is the bottleneck. Behind that 7 exabytes of networks space is likely 7 exabytes empty space already purchased, waiting to be consumed, or even more. And its not only farmers buying drives - scalpers are buying drives to scalp the farmers too. Go look on amazon and tell me how many drives you see in stock that are bigger than 6 TB. They are sold out. Supply is also a bottleneck - the new currency would grow even faster if they could buy even more storage. For all intents and purposes, that 700 petabytes of storage provided to consumers daily is almost all consumed by currency farmers. If they could deliver double the storage to consumers, at 1.4 exabytes per day, they would probably still sell all of them.

But wait - there's more.

WDC also makes SSDs, and Seagate does not (Seagate has 0.2% marketshare of SSDs). I didn't think the new currency would have much affect on the SSD market since the are needed in far smaller quantities than HDDs, and the go-to has mostly been enterprise drives by Intel and Samsung rather than WDC. But I was wrong. Just this morning, I was making my rounds on Amazon and noticed that WD SN750s 1TBs are almost out of stock, there are only 2 available. SN750 2TBs are out of stock. SN 850s are sold out. I'll go into why this is significant.

A company called Phison makes SSD controllers. They recently said they are raising their prices 10% due to supply constraints as the new currency has driven up SSD demand. This is a big indicator that the SSD demand is actually super high. You know those SN drives I talked about earlier almost being out of stock? Yeah, WDC makes their own controllers for those. They don't need Phison. If other manufacturers have to buy more expensive controllers, WDC can just raise their prices and make that profit themselves. SSD demand is certainly less than HDD and it's lagging behind HDD, but an NVME SSD drive shortage could be right around the corner. The new currency is very intensive on the SSDs and they are destroyed quickly, so buying NVMEs are not one-time purchases, they are like the gas the fuels the car. They will need to be purchased as more and more HDDs are purchased continually.

#Bear case

Nobody likes bears so I will address the risks quickly. The obvious risk is that the new currency is over priced and will either die out completely or crash to the point people will stop buying HDDs and the demand will only be a momentary spike in the rear view. I strongly do not believe this is the case and I think yesterday is a good test that shows that even under extreme pressure, the new currency is well positioned and strong. It's not going to 0 because of a market crash. I can go far into detail into why I believe this new currency is here to stay, and the demand will persist for potentially years, but I would have to say enough words that I think this post will just be removed.

The second risk is that NAND flash memory continues to decline in price. Since the pandemic the price has gone up, as datacenters are forced to expand, but I think the effects of the pandemic are not going to end any time soon and in fact that there will be no return to normal at all. I believe work from home is just going to be part of the future regardless of covid, which means more network and more servers and more data is going to be needed. I think the analyst expectation that revenue would collapse in 2021 as the pandemic ends and being surprised that it at least remained flat is going to be wind in WDC's sails even apart from the new currency's affects.

The third risk is management not dealing with the new currency demand well. If they are really bearish on the currency, they may not raise supply enough to capitalize on the increased demand. They may think the demand is temporary and they will be left with oversupply if they ramp now. David Goeckeler became CEO of WDC last year and he's got a background in tech of course, but more specifically in Cisco. He is known for transformational leadership and I think that shows with his decision to suspend the WDC dividend. If he is looking to transform WDC, I think this is the perfect opportunity for him. 

#Summary TL;DR

HDD demand has sold out everything there is to sell out. Price increases are imminent, and SSDs could follow soon. All of this is due to a new currency that uses HDDs and SSDs, which is currently so profitable that whales will continue to buy them even at 30, 50 or 100% premiums. None of this was accounted for in WDC's most recent earnings call, and the price has not reacted to it yet. This thing is a ticking time bomb. WDC was already on track to a better than expected 2021 and this will launch it to interstellar space.

I believe that this trend is lasting all year and we are going to $150+. If you want to make a short term play and go balls deep I recommend July or October calls for 80-90c. If WDC's next earnings are the catalyst, the July calls may not be the best value, but there is a pretty good chance that the market will wake up and see that WDC is killing it well before the first week of August. If you are a real smooth brain ape, you can't go wrong with shares. There is virtually no downside risk, WDC was already turning heads this year even without the new currency. STONKS ONLY GO UP"

2021-05-20 22:06:45,wallstreetbets,"“Morgan Stanley’s Moore last week noted that Western Digital sells about 40% of its drives via distributors and retailers, while Seagate sells about 30% that way.”

The first leg of this catalyst is going to benefit WDC more than Seagate in my view. Especially if you look at WDC’s product mix. This is a once in a lifetime demand catalyst for WDC’s product mix given the shift to SSDs over HDDs."
2021-05-20 23:52:48,wallstreetbets,"I bought about 1000 shares of STX back when it dropped to $20.  It was paying a $2.52 yearly dividend at that point (12.6%).  At that rate you are doubling your money in 6 years just on the dividend, which is insane.  Been a bit of a bumpy road since then, but never regretted it.  Anyway, rode that baby up to $73 and sold off about half back in January.  Never thought it would make it all the way to $100, but I'm letting what I have left ride."
2021-05-20 22:21:26,wallstreetbets,Also since covid we've had a hard bounce from a low of 28 to the high 70's I believe WDC is worth at least 100 by EOY
2021-05-20 22:16:40,wallstreetbets,"The opposite is true - hard drives use very low amounts of power, like 5-7 watts. For reference, gpus use like 100-300 watts. As the network grows, the environmental impact will grow too, but you would need 20 hard drives minimum to equal 1 GPU. Asics for b*tcoïn are even worse. I did some analysis on this when the netspace was around 5 exabytes and at that time the ratio of power used (ballpark figures  & napkin math of course) was like 10,000:300:1 for b*itcoïn : Athareum : chia. 

If there ever was an environmentally friendly new currency, it's chia. Proof of stake is more eco friendly but it also introduces controversial features like no protection from 51% attacks and way more centralization."

But hey, I enjoy seeing people who bought upper 200's still trying to rally folks to squeeze another 3% in the stock here and there and getting excited when the CEO tweets an emoji.  Anywaysss.  catalysts to come, dont have your money stuck in old ideas, it's time to have paper hands.

Been riding weeklies on WDC for 3 weeks, and made a nice cushion with that rally up on the 17th.  Now in the same boat running leaps. Up to about 4 weeks ago, I could get 12TB Externals at best buy for $200.  Now they're either out, being scalped on Ebay or 50%+ retail price increases.   Keep an eye out on pools release date and when Chia moves to US markets - I'd imagine whichever companies correspond influx of hardware into stores around these potential peak times, will get a ton of awesome exposure, especially with most folks who throw money at the market like a dart board.  First come first serve.  GL bud, Bram said the netspace growth rate will outpace all data on the internet thus far, in plots in less than 2 months.  Bullish AF."

2021-05-20 21:55:31,wallstreetbets,Proof of Work is unprofitable for most people because of ASICS and because Proof of Work is most viable for people with access to cheap unlimited electricity. There is a new PoW called randomx that uses CPUs because it rotates the mining algorithm on a regular basis which nullifies ASICS. Proof of Space Time does not suffer from economies of scale like PoW does. The profitability can certainly decrease but major players and home miners should have ROIs that are much closer to each other because they are not using specialized components. Bram Cohen talks about this on Twitter btw

2021-05-20 21:36:06,wallstreetbets,"Cool bud, not wishing you ill will, but ""Diamond hands"" on a stock that's been sideways for a month, what's the endgame? You should realize the gains and find another opportunity that can compound those 800% gains. ""I'm not selling""  you should, I would.  I did.

&#x200B;

I mean, actual question, what are you holding onto it for, a potential market correction?  Do you think it can continue to rise, but the whole, ""I like the stock"" is a good stance and all and it had it's time and place - but will it really gain enough resurgence to push it higher, and certainly seems unlikely that it'll get squeezed again.

I always think of having to file taxes as my base example. I’ve always used turbo tax and just never had problems. There definitely could be a better experience behind it all, but at this point it works, I know how to use it, and saving some potential money for a better experience here doesn’t make sense. I have a hard time believing any company doing tax filling better would have any chance of disrupting the market and capturing meaningful share. 

Mortgage lending? Yea that’s been around forever so that’s one of my main concerns, you are gonna get a lot of old fart players that will do dirty tricks to try to hold on. 

Best of luck though, I have a call on another stock expiring tomorrow and it was -99% until it went up 1000%. There is hope for you 🤗"
2021-05-21 17:36:47,wallstreetbets,I have an RC Plane. We coming to rescue you.
2021-05-20 23:14:21,wallstreetbets,It’s a good strategy for sure. I may have been too ambitious about my targets though. I said i would sell when $17 hits. Bought at $15 so I didn’t think it’d be a bad swing. I do need to set better stop losses though and cut it short when I’m seeing a reversal.
2021-05-20 22:23:11,wallstreetbets,Woah he made money on coin puts? I wanted to get in on that so bad but the premium was so high it made it look like it wouldn't actually pay off.

2021-05-21 00:33:14,wallstreetbets,"I think I was down from 30k -> 8k -> 36k. Literally if it even tapped $17, that was my exit. Think it went to high 16s and dumped, unfortunately. True advice right there, especially for a speculative stock. Doesn’t matter how much I believe it should be, markets gonna act like a market 💀"
2021-05-20 23:46:02,wallstreetbets,"Definitely agree  on the take as well man. It's all just speculation at this point, but scared money don't make money. Although stupid money definitely loses money aka me on this  play.

You will know if I come back from the grave if I make a post tomorrow! Thank you for the insight, boss!"
2021-05-20 23:18:11,wallstreetbets,"Options Alpha basically convinced me not to do any stop losses. They will hurt you more than help you.

At least with $MVIS. (And with the game store) you can see a dead cat bounce after the stock tanked. In the future, use this second peak to sell. You won't need to set up stop losses that may be subject to slippage that way.

(Hell, you can even sell calls or buy puts after you see this happen)."
2021-05-20 23:08:55,wallstreetbets,Apparently lol I scrolled back in our chat and checked out his positions he mentioned having during his killer run. Not too sure how much he made on each position tho coin may not have been lucrative
2021-05-20 23:00:46,wallstreetbets,Why didn't you sell calls?
2021-05-21 04:06:06,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-21 13:15:13,wallstreetbets,I thought we were inversing hedge funds?
2021-05-20 23:09:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah 90% options 10% stock 0% buying power is the saying right ?
2021-05-21 06:08:52,wallstreetbets,Like I wanted to own that over priced stock.
2021-05-21 10:21:18,wallstreetbets,"Could you explain this strategy? I'm having trouble understanding how selling calls would solve that problem. 

If he sells a call he can offset the premium of the put, I get that. 
So if the price decreases, his put gain in value and his call is worthless so he would've effectively make profit. 

But if the price increases, his put would be worthless and he'd have to either deliver the underlying stock at a cheaper price (bc of the contract) or buy a call contract at a higher price (bc the spot price now increased) to close his position. So he would lose money. 

So selling calls would only be benificial to offset the put premium if the price decreases. Did I get the logic right?"
2021-05-21 13:29:16,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, I bought puts on bond etfs. I’m making paper"
2021-05-21 12:27:51,wallstreetbets,It is and this is what happens in a casino
2021-05-20 23:13:02,wallstreetbets,"Actually, I'm turning my portfolio into something like 50% cash and 50% options. The cash buffer makes it easier to leg in and out of trades and enter new ones.

I don't like stocks because you are a victim to the crash and boom cycle of the markets. Your parents probably had their retirement accounts wiped out in 2008. At least with options, you have enough leverage and versatility to survive in any market environment. Is SPY staying neutral? Sell an iron condor. Is the market bullish? Sell puts and buy LEAPS. So on, so forth.

You have the added benefit of having so much more exposure with options. Why don't more people trade these?"
2021-05-21 08:06:18,wallstreetbets,Do a spread?
2021-05-21 12:43:08,wallstreetbets,Selling a call does not result in an obligation to own the stock
2021-05-21 10:26:11,wallstreetbets,"Not what I'm referring to.

With this call spread, you sell one itm or atm call, and buy one otm call to reduce the collateral requirement.

Here you're only collecting premium"
2021-05-20 23:21:02,wallstreetbets,Yeah if you be realistic with strike prices/expirations And you actually pull profits instead of getting greedy life gets real good
2021-05-21 08:14:59,wallstreetbets,Dammit. I didn't even think about offsetting the put premium with selling a call. I honestly looked at the put premium for puts I thought would print and said lol no and didn't look at the call premium which I bet was also high due to IV.
2021-05-21 12:52:44,wallstreetbets,No but you need to cover it either by having the stock or the free capital.
2021-05-21 10:29:16,wallstreetbets,Oh ok thanks. So basically you offset your position by taking a long otm and short atm and collect only the difference in premiums?
2021-05-21 10:38:44,wallstreetbets,The otm call you bought acts as insurance in case things don't go your way.
2021-05-21 10:43:21,wallstreetbets,Selling options allows you to take advantage of theta decay and decreased volatility as well.

Was making good money till I got too confident and Schwab took away my options trading privileges. Now yolo with PLTR shares bought during DL. Still up over 30% with current price. I understand the apes here can trade large quantity’s with less money. BUT, it’s total crap shoot and the odds are against them. Many unseen forces behind the scenes. Last year market was primed for making money (study Softbank) regardless of experience. Now not so easy. Please take my advice just buy shares and wait till company is a bonafide champion in the world of public companies. It will happen. Patience my fellow traders."

2021-05-21 03:30:44,wallstreetbets,Haha...
2021-05-20 20:03:48,wallstreetbets,Yeah that makes sense. I've dabbled with calls a bit and had mixed results. Just one OTM contract to keep it cheap and less risky for now. Maybe my confidence will rise and I'll end up posting a stupid loss here someday lol. Thanks for the help!
2021-05-20 20:07:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'd say just go ahead and buy some shitty ass calls. Like maybe a PLTR call that's just slightly OTM on the Thurs before exp. It's unlikely to be more than $20 or so (given current prices), and you can legitimately see the price trickle down as time goes on. And maybe it'll go up and you can make... uh... $25. Don't waste money on expensive ass options like DASH- the premium there is too high a price to pay for options school :("
2021-05-20 20:19:46,wallstreetbets,Sounds good. Thanks again stranger!
2021-05-20 21:13:03,wallstreetbets,"Here's a tip, when you deal with these options near expiration that's out of the money, never go all in. I personally learned the hard way when I first started almost a decade ago and wiped $100k like a retard.

If you are confident and good with your perception, its possible to make some decent consistent money, but you will ALWAYS win and lose some. If you go all in and reinvest your income, you might win big the first time, and win big for the next five times, but all it takes is one all in where you lose and say bye bye to 80 to 90% of your money. So if you go in always do so with a fixed amount, maybe 10% of initial portfolio."
2021-05-20 21:19:04,wallstreetbets,Yeah man I got kids so I'm not all about a yolo like that!
2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"VIRGIN GALACTIC MAYBE GO BOOM?! Alright, listen up fuck heads. Today Virgin galactic just released this Tweet. They're planning to test out their new space ship 22nd May, and if the test flight is successful, then SPCE go to da moon.   🚀  🚀 

https://preview.redd.it/atjw6r0lza071.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dee70e4fcf252de71da4829d35816b716396bd4

  
How high could it go? Well If we take a look at the graph below, we can see that SPCE peaked at around 60 bucks  back in February in ANTICIPATION for the previous test flight which was delayed until May for safety reasons (They had some problems with electromagnetic interference which is fixed now). 

https://preview.redd.it/7gkt6q2b0b071.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf751660b6ec987adb3614000e9d1d19f4dd6b7b

So if the test flight actually happens on the 22nd, then could be really big boom. Currently the price is around 18-19 bucks, so it's an absolute steal in my opinion, but there is always the risk that some shit fucks up and the test flight is delayed even further, in which case I will have to sell the house.

And before any of you autistic fucks say that SpaceX is better, just keep in mind that Virgin Galactic is playing a whole different game. SpaceX is trying to go to Mars, and Virgin Galactic is just trying to do some space tourism. Also keep in mind that Virgin Galactic was founded 2 whole years after SpaceX, so SpaceX has had a bit of a head start.

To conclude, possibly spaceship go fly this weekend, if so, big money, if no, I go bankrupt."

2021-05-21 00:42:11,wallstreetbets,"According to what I'm seeing, they have little to no debt. They've cut net loss by more than half. Granted, they're not profitable *yet,* however neither was Amazon at first!

As a space *tourism* sector, I think VG has nailed it. I think it'll be huge. There's nothing the rich are looking to blow cash on more than a space exploration tour. With Branson's passion for space, catering to the rich, and (well) being rich I see huge upside potential on some LEAPs.

The beauty of SPCE is with Virgin Holdings (not VG) being the parent company, they can pay expenses down to show better figures on 10Q until they're operational. There will be opinions for this as being good and bad, but it doesn't show as negative in the short term.

Disregard the P/S is 20,000+++

2021-05-21 08:23:24,wallstreetbets,"For me SPCE  is a quick in and out play, if launch is successful price will spike for a month or so, long term space x will bend galactic over and smash them , space x is already delivering astronauts to the space station and have quite a few nasa contracts , then you also have blue origin owned by Bezos who is selling a billion of Amazon stock every year to fund blue origin , I really can't see virgin galactic being around in ten years.

I know that space x long term goal is to colonize Mars and musk has confirmed that starlink is only bing pursued because it helps fund space x main mission , I can see space x getting into tourism flights in the next couple of years to increase revenue, and I don't feel like galactic can compete with them on any level of they decide to get into space tourism (and not just low earth orbit flights)"

Then they fly the Italian Airforce in the fall, on a $500k per seat astronaut training flight.

Then they go operational from Jsn 2022, and scale the business to 400 flights a year in New Mexico whilst looking for other global sites to build local spaceports. 

The delivered the latest SpaceShip3 in March which looks awesome. They have a new Delta class on the drawing board. 1,600 places reserved for passengers. New tickets to go on sale late summer, after Branson flight!

Now your spread earns you $2 a share if your covered call hits and you sell shares for $14 plus premium you have left. The other thing you could do if you want to grow you position is average down with puts. Sell the 8 put a month out and do the same ramp, sell 2x 8p one month out, buy one 8.5p if you can for a net credit over all. It’s basically a butterfly, but instead of buy 1 sell 2 buy 1, one is covered by shares or cash."

2021-05-21 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Because I don't think people on this board understand the idea of ""diversification"" or ""risk-adjusted returns"" I want to first start off by saying that I'm not liable for financial losses. I recently built an app that can generate efficient frontiers when you plug in individual US Equities. 

If you aren't familiar with the efficient frontier, what it tries to find is the *mean-variance portfolio.* This type of model deals with portfolio management / optimization. In terms of the efficient frontier you are trying to find the best portfolio allocation weights that give you the best risk adjusted returns. 

**In simple words:** you give it stocks and it tells you the best percentage holdings

I recently built an app on some python code that does this sort of optimization. There is no programming required to use the app. When running the app it will give two portfolios, minimum variance, and maximized sharpe (same as mean-variance, mean-markowitz). Minimum variance will tell you the least riskiest holding strategy (green), and max sharpe will give you the best reward-for-risk holding (red). I call that portfolio *the-juice-is-worth-the-squeeze.* Here is a sample output. 

&#x200B;

I used around 100,000 simulations, and 10Y of adjusted close data. 

The reason why I bring this up is because it does two things. The first is that it promotes portfolio diversification, which I know is pretty uncommon here. Also it finds the most aggressive returns in terms of minimizing risk. If you have high returns and wonder why you returns are so much higher than standard investment funds its probably because you are here

https://preview.redd.it/qrmgyru6ta071.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8f856e00960d9d8669f442edf7729e2ddbfaae5

Yah you may good returns, you are probably taking on more risk than what you are getting in return.

&#x200B;

**If your brain has folds in it:**

Essentially the code is using a monte carlo simulation to solve this optimization problem.

It feels like they controlled the narrative with the media and made it seem like lending was in for a rough year.... but UWMC is growing every month. I get that people are shorting this because 99% could never know how great UWM actually is (since they are a whole sales lender they give small brokers the same platform the big banks have with better rates).

2021-05-21 17:11:05,wallstreetbets,"As a mortgage broker/banker. Fuck UWM. Never, in my 10 years has a lender made a borker sign a legal document making them not do business with a certain company, never mind sue their asses off if they violate it. Some brokers signed it with not reading the ""$50,000 penalty if it was violated. Very plainly UWM was getting beat by a couple competitors and the Cry baby CEO didn't like that and gave brokers an ultimatum. I don't think I would believe what you see on the news. They probably are and will be hurting for business. Example. They used to have a minimum credit score of 640 and woulnd not take a modular home, nevermind a manufactured home. And I was told on the past they never will take lower credit scores and manufactured or modular homes, because they want good high quality deals. Lo and behold they lowered their minimum credot score and taking manufactured and modular homes. TRANSLATION: they lost so much business from brokers not signing the addendum that they had to change their business model and lower their requirements and add manufactured housing to try to get more loans in the door to keep their employees busy. Furthermore, not letting brokers shop every lender available, in my book, is considered steering. I do not miss doing business with their moronic underwriters and policies."

2021-05-20 22:32:36,wallstreetbets,Current shareholder equity is 405M. Current market cap is 13B. About 60% overvalued at current prices.
2021-05-21 18:04:08,wallstreetbets,"Ummm....I looked over the replies.  Some replies were a bit off.

It's a mortgage that is higher than allowed by the ""Agencies"".  It is the oposite of what is know as a conforming loan.  The limit varies by market.  The mechanics mean the broker can't turn arround and sell it(as easily) as a conforming loan.  The take away is it can't be sold as easily as a non-jumbo.  They are particularly popular in California & NY.

In the past(before the metldown), jumbo's rates were higher.  Nowdays, it's the opposite, the risk on jumbo's is lower(mostly because the lenders tightened up, because it was on their books).  

For a wholesaler, it means more money is tied up vs the fees he would get for a conforming loan.  In other words, with the same money, the wholesaler could originate 2-3 mortgages, and collect the same fixed fees on each instead of just one jumbo.    In the end it means when the wholesaler reaches his in house money limit on the books, the less fees he collects.  I don't know how much day-to-day operations money UWMC has or what limits they face.  But, I do know it used to be wholesalers/lenders were compensated by higher interest rates of jumbos."
2021-05-20 22:36:15,wallstreetbets,"I don't want bullish, I want more cheap shares lol."
2021-05-20 22:37:54,wallstreetbets,"I, buy hold, sell covered calls on the spikes, buy shares on the dips. (sometimes buy covered calls back if it really spikes, then reposition the cover call at a higher strike when it's done running.) And dividend + Premium all = free stocks. Make stock make stocks! DIG IN, DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING, BUT BE READY FOR EVERYTHING!"
2021-05-20 23:12:28,wallstreetbets,"Buy shares, they print money or more shares, then use that to buy more so the dividends compounds. 1000 shares = 100$ on dividend which is 12 shares. Sell 10x covered call at 10$ strike for = $700 which is 82 shares (at current price). Which is 94 free shares, buy 6 more shares with deposit and then you have 1100 shares, 100 are almost free. Now you still have 100 shares of profit to the upside over $10 . Or the contracts expire worthless and you have 100 shares. The trick is to sell the premium on the runups and get the shares at a cheaper price so you can make 100 shares without deposit. Next time you will make $110 in divy + whatever you sell 11 contracts for. (If you keep the shares) If you get the same amount which was 11 x $70 = (770 +110 = 880) = or 100 shares at 8.80 each and total shares to 1200 (which make even more next time). In this way your investment will compound, or you sellem all at way more than you bought them.  Rinse and repeat. Then once a year Every year put some divy and premium back for your taxes. Worst case is if it runs up to $20, then you have to sell your shares for more than you bought them (If you don't buy the calls back) but not what people are willing to pay."
2021-05-20 22:49:45,wallstreetbets,"I don't think retards told you to buy options. When they say buy the dip, they mean shares bro. The shares print either a: Money or b: more shares. If you want shares at a good price and in multiples of 100, sell the puts, LOL!"

Any disciplined investor does that."

Buy100 shares of stock at $x.xx 
Sell a covered call at a strike price of $x.xx +$y.yy (something higher than your initial purchase price per share).  

If the price hits your strike at least it was above your initial cost and you get to keep the premium.  If it doesn’t hit your strike you got to keep the premium.  Rinse, repeat."

And 410 mainly because energy will dump on lower oil prices, and also some other commodities that have been getting ahead of themselves 

This happened in tech, tech dump has been over done, hence we saw the come back maybe even the last whole week, QQQ has been much stronger than SPY"

2021-05-21 07:25:11,wallstreetbets,"No margin is less 

Each 1 point movement on the VIX = $1000 gain/loss for the VIX futures contract, so when VIX is 23 each contract is ""worth"" $23k, that is you would lose $23k if VIX went to zero.

The $1M comes from $23k/contract x 45 contracts."

2021-05-21 00:50:31,wallstreetbets,"It’s a CBOE traded index only options or futures allowed. VIX Index is a calculation designed to produce a measure of constant, 30-day expected volatility of the U.S. stock market, derived from real-time, mid-quote prices of S&P 500 Index (SPX)call and put options. On a global basis, it is one of the most recognized measures of volatility.

2021-05-21 08:16:50,wallstreetbets,"It stops just at the edge of troll, because it's within the circle jerk and meant as a jovial overstatement in support of the topic at hand"

2021-05-21 08:35:30,wallstreetbets,If only you were able to understand it lmao.
2021-05-20 22:18:09,wallstreetbets,"You keep using that word ""fear"" when it's already been pointed out to you that it's juvenile to assign emotions to price movements. People can buy puts for many reasons, not always fear."
2021-05-20 22:45:33,wallstreetbets,"If you think it's juvenile to assign emotions to price movements, clearly you don't know the first thing about equity markets and you shouldn't be investing without the aid of an advisor for your own financial security. I recommend you call your broker or bank. 

Also what reasons other than hedging/speculating do you think options are for? Sure people buy put options at all time. Did you think that the reasoning behind the calculations of the VIX is that put options volume was 0 at all times except when there is fear?

No. It's only that it **INCREASES** in fearful times because **MORE** people hedge their position. There is a direct correlation. 

Just shut up man seriously you're an ignorant twat and you can't be taught shit no wonder you probably dropped out. Either take a look on Google (which you ignored) or take a look at how much your dumb fucking ass is getting downvoted and how I'm getting upvoted, it should give you a small clue, imbecile."
2021-05-20 22:50:05,wallstreetbets,"Like if at this point you still don't understand there's just nothing else more to do, I explained it from various angles multiple times and you're still completely failing to get a grasp of anything that's been said. 

You're probably the type of guy that doesn't 'believe' in vaccines or doesn't 'believe' the earth is round just because you can't understand jackshit of the phenomenon."
2021-05-20 23:05:58,wallstreetbets,"🤡. Lol. You actually believe internet points matter as if this place is some bastion of higher learning. Lmfao. And you wrote like 60 paragraphs because you were so embarrassed that you didn't realize what the ""V"" in VIX stood for this whole time. 😂"
2021-05-20 23:10:26,wallstreetbets,"Still don't understand uh? Sad that you can't actually withstand my arguments because you've literally got none other than 'tHe v sTaNdS FoR vOlAtiLitY' 'tHe cReAtoR cAlLeD iT VoLaTiLiY🥴🥴'

You can't form any intelligible argument. And you still think that VIX isn't an index of fear after all of that🤡🤦‍♂️. So sad that people like you that stops learning at 16 think they know everything, and thinks that knowledge isn't a continuous road, it's people like you that is a gangrene to society."
2021-05-20 23:14:34,wallstreetbets,"To reiterate ; believe me I've known far longer than you what the VIX is and what its 3 letters mean. Unfortunately I didn't stop at learning just those 3 things, I also learned all its implications, which again you showed us all that you clearly didn't, and you're now too embarrassed to admit that you didn't know it was an index of fear 


(did you notice the psychological pattern of how whenever I've won the argument you twist the original point around and project what you feel unto me? Don't worry though, it's pretty common)"
2021-05-20 23:21:30,wallstreetbets,"Nope. My original word was correct and it's still correct. It measures volatility and volatility only. Any other emotions projected onto a math equations are infantile. And I'm confident that anyone reading this will come to the same conclusion, and that you will eventually as well once you get over your bruised ego."
2021-05-20 23:28:58,wallstreetbets,"Aggregate behavior can be derived from market movements. Volatility measures market movements. Thus, yes, you can absolutely infer an emotion toward a certain extreme behavior and you can clearly understand that if you did any research whatsoever (because yet again you're failing to provide anything material). 

And I'm also very confident that anyone reading this will come to the same conclusion because it is literally backed by verifiable facts.

I don't however think that I will come over to your conclusion that the VIX isn't a gauge of fear because that's false. Sorry that you can't accept it and/or are too scared to admit you didn't know. Oh and thanks for your concern but my ego is doing very well, as some random wannabe advisor that has nothing further to discuss has absolutely no credibility in my educated eyes."
2021-05-20 23:38:54,wallstreetbets,"""Anything material""? What do you call the creator's explanation of it? you never even read it 😂 

https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/vix/"
2021-05-20 23:43:31,wallstreetbets,"Show me one place other than your precious definition, that I've already said I knew by heart, where the creator says the VIX is NOT a measure of fear. No where 😂🤦‍♂️. Because that's essentially what it is."
2021-05-21 00:04:35,wallstreetbets,"You say they have to explicitly DENY your claim even though they never mention your claim, not even once? And they specifically say it measures volatility like I said? 😂

By that logic they haven't explicitly denied that it measures unicorn farts so therefore it's possible it measures unicorn farts. I don't understand why the founders explanation isn't good enough for you. You can't get a more accurate description."
2021-05-21 00:29:20,wallstreetbets,"What do you think volatility is exactly? I think I've found out the problem and it's that you've got a misconception of what volatility means. 

It makes me laugh that you think the creator **himself, just himself and absolutely no one else** has to explicitly mention it to make it true. Can't you figure anything out by your own? It's as if you were trying to tell me that black holes aren't true because einstein didn't explicitly said it was the case even though with **his creation, his formulas**, you can clearly derived that conclusion. (And in this analogy einstein definitely was against black holes, whereas in this case I'm pretty sure that even the creators themselves agree that it's a measure of fear 🤣). 

There's ton of other papers like the one I posted above (and that you clearly failed to read). The VIX is an index of fear. Period."
2021-05-21 00:56:05,wallstreetbets,How convenient for you that the most accurate and important source by the authors isn't good enough for you.  It's hard for me to imagine the mental gymnastics you must be going through to save yourself some embarrassment. It's ok. You were wrong and looking a bit foolish but you still have a chance to redeem yourself but just reading the definition of VIX 😃
2021-05-21 08:32:14,wallstreetbets,"Oh don't worry I know it's very hard for you to use your brain to come to any conclusion. I don't expect you to understand 100% of the 'mental gymnastic'. You're just not that smart ☹️. 

Sad of you that you can't recognize any verifiable paper with verifiable facts by people that's got far more knowledge than you. But it's ok. If your dumb ass is to scared to admit he doesn't know shit about finance it's really alright 🙂

How much of an uneducated, arrogant, condescendant fool you look to everyone right now. Especially to me lmao you've got no credibility tradesman🤡 how small in your shorts you gotta be 😂

I'm literally a finance bachelor and have a professional designation, how uneducated and unknowledgeable do you think you look?

What do you got dummy? A high school diploma? 😂"
2021-05-21 11:33:13,wallstreetbets,"I see you completely dropped the reliance on sources because the creators directly contradicted you , and you're too awkward and embarrassed to admit your mistake 😂. And since you ran out of sources you're resorting to personal attacks. 

I feel sorry for your professors if you think that mathematical formula explicitly designed to measure price volatility was designed to measure a human emotion, even when that's not what the designers of it said it does 😂."

2021-05-21 11:47:49,wallstreetbets,"The creator directly contradicts me? 

-------------------------

'I see you completely dropped the reliance on sources because the creators directly contradicted you'

Just quoting you to make sure your stupid ass won't edit 

-------------------------

Lmao I literally just asked you to show me one place where he did contradict me and you basically admitted you couldn't find that. 

Oh and btw you're the one that resorted to personnal attacks. Do you finally start to see the psychological pattern that I was talking about before? The blatant cognitive dissonance going on in your head since yesterday?

Oh and I noticed you also conveniently dismissed to explain what volatility is. You see, that's because you've got no idea. You can't explain anything. You're ignorant as fuck. And you're a lost cause in the progress of educating humanity. 

You can't even comprehend the basics explanation and various examples I gave you. You can't even understand the various papers that explain why it is an index of fear and why it was given that name. Do you think people pulled that name out of their ass just for the fun of it? How dumb are you seriously?

You've got every professionals and experts in the area agreeing that it is an index of fear, hence why it's commonly called between professionals the index of fear, and then there's you. The unknowledgeable idiot. But Bob obviously knows more than all of those that studied in the subject (me), those that are expert in the subject and those that work in the subject. You look like a damn clown by claiming the VIX **IS NOT** an Index of Fear and still too embarrassed to admit you didn't know what it was. 🤡

Oh and btw don't worry for my own professors, I'm next to a straight-A student"

And again you're avoiding literally all of my points and turn right around trying to argue something that was never even my point in the first place 🙂 Damn you're such a clogged up dummy

You really look like an idiot, you should maybe start reading some books, might help with your reading and comprehension capabilities."
2021-05-21 15:01:50,wallstreetbets,"The wiki says ""a popular measure of the stock market's expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options."" 

Wow , even your sources agree with me, thanks for finally admitting you're wrong 😅"
2021-05-21 15:29:47,wallstreetbets,"Nope. That's again because you fail to read properly. 😂 you also conveniently cut the rest of the quote lmao. And btw your source doesn't even address my point 🤡.  Seems like you've really got some trouble to understand what is even the point you're trying to argue. Because it is sure as shit not what I've been explaining to you for the past 24 hours 😂😂. And as long as your ignore the arguments I tell you whenever there's nothing in your small brain that can be thought of and argued back, I won't ever take you seriously lmao."
2021-05-21 15:50:19,wallstreetbets,"So YOUR source literally says it measures volatility and you still deny it? What else could you possibly need? 

The very thing you linked says what I've been saying all along - it's designed to measure volatility.  There is literally nothing able to convince you, even your own sources agree with me. I think you must be incredibly lonely in real life or something to want my attention that badly."
2021-05-21 16:27:48,wallstreetbets,"To reiterate because that's like the seventh time now, I literally never denied that it measures volatility. But you couldn't understand that because you don't even know what volatility means. Read the comments again, because as I said, you've really got some understanding issue.

2021-05-21 18:12:24,wallstreetbets,"> I literally never denied that it measures volatility.

Thanks, then I win 😃 It measures volatility and not fear just like I said originally. I see you've grown as a person. ☺️"
2021-05-21 18:16:19,wallstreetbets,"Nope.  You're still wrong and you know it but because I keep roasting you, you feel way too embarrassed and angry to admit that you were wrong and are now trying to make it seems as if you won by voluntarily misquoting the point of the argument. And again, if you don't believe me, just take a look at the original upvotes retard. 😂🤦‍♂️

You're such a sad person"
2021-05-21 18:18:19,wallstreetbets,"How old are you out of curiosity? And what have you studied in? What do you work in?

Really just curious because I'm fairly certain that everything that I've assumed is right. The more you speak and the more delusional you appear. It's almost like dementia. If you're old, I'd be concerned. If you're young, I'd be equally concerned. 🤡 Be careful xx"
2021-05-21 18:30:11,wallstreetbets,"Let's see, so far my source agrees with me, your source quoted me almost word for word, then you subconsciously started mimicking me language, so my original point was and is still accurate which you probably realized about 59 posts ago but are too awkward to admit it. 

You've even stopped arguing your original point and seem to pathetically attack me personally , which is really odd that you think I could remotely care what you think. At this point you're desperately lonely and just need someone to talk to."
2021-05-21 19:43:48,wallstreetbets,"No, your source doesn't agree with you. It only agrees on what numbers they use to calculate the daily VIX price, which was never the point even 59 posts ago, if you could actually read carefully. 

The only reason I stopped arguing my initial point that the VIX is a gauge of fear is that you clearly couldn't communicate in the language I was using and was getting extremely redundant to hear you repeat the exact same 3 words and being absolutely illiterate trying to elaborate your thoughts, even after I clearly pointed out that those 3 words had literally nothing to do with my point. 

Again, look at the multiple sources I have posted (do you want me to post them again, because clearly you haven't read anything, unsurprisingly, as reading doesn't seem to be your forte) and it might help you understand. And if it doesn't do, again for the 6th time straight, just take a look at the upvotes dumbass. I seriously don't understand how someone that got downvoted like you still could think they were right. Just shows how deep your denial is. 

'At this point you're desperately lonely and just need someone to talk to' lmao here's the projection again, as you're the one coming back every damn hour to keep the argument as if you had actually researched anything during those hours."

2021-05-21 01:21:58,wallstreetbets,"Probably better off considering it from the angle not of who’s going to be supplying SpaceX, but rather who’s going to benefit most from SpaceX-based infrastructure.  Getting things into space is expensive and dangerous and that’s the bottleneck SpaceX is trying to break open, but in doing so they’re going to be the equivalent of railroads in the 19th century and airlines in the 20th, and essentially they’re just transporting things from point A to point B for third parties.  

So, who’s going to be using this infrastructure?  

The first mining company that captures an asteroid loaded with heavy and rare earth metals is going to become incredibly valuable until a second company does the same.  Similarly, anyone who looks at building steel smelting plants operating in hard vacuum will have a uniquely valuable product, as hard vacuum causes impurities to escape to an extent that you wind up with steel an order of magnitude stronger than anything that can be refined on Earth.  To my knowledge, no one has announced that they’re pursuing this, but that’s because the infrastructure isn’t there yet and has been greatly neglected by governmental agencies since the end of the Space Race.  I also expect that such a company will keep their plans for either avenue a close secret until they’re poised to actually implement them, so keep ears open.

A riskier but potentially rewarding bet would be on energy companies and Lunar gas mining.  The possibility of helium-3 being the key fuel for sustaining nuclear fusion with a net gain of energy remains speculative, mostly because it’s scarce enough on Earth to prevent significant testing.  The best reserve of He-3 in reach is locked up in lunar soil, so *if* it turns out He-3 *is* the key to bootstrapping self-sustaining nuclear fusion reactors, whomever gets to the Moon first with the intent of strip-mining it for helium will essentially be the new oil barons, and the energy companies that can build and operate fusion reactors the new energy barons."

2021-05-21 04:27:39,wallstreetbets,"I think this is a clinical stage bio pharma, so people do need to remember that. IMO it's a good stock to hold long and wait for a few of the pipeline candidates to materialize into revenue. That takes time. 

The company is very well run from a science standpoint, it has a healthy financial position and backing, it has excellent partnerships, a very broad pipeline with a couple of products that can translate into revenue within this year.

It has made a very bad partnership in the past and there is an ongoing trial on that, where Sorrento is expected to get compensation of somewhere between 200 mil to 1 bil dollars. So that was a mistake, but currently it's expected to bring in some revenue.

I think they are lacking in PR. The CEO isn't charismatic at all, they need to work on that aspect, IMO. 

They are constantly hiring. They are currently setting up a sales team country-wide. I don't see a scam angle here."

Hinderburg is a pro-shortting company that dishes out false, derogatory, news-catching reports to benefit its short positions. It is one the worst things that exist in the financial world and its owners should be outright jailed. 

Sorrento was right to immediately react with legal action against these horrible, horrible people who make a living out of manipulating prices with lies and negativity.  SRNE might or might not be a good investment, but it's a real company actually trying to make real scientific discoveries and manufacture real health products. Hinderburg manufacture lies for profit while causing harm to people and institutions without an ounce of morality. If anyone nowadays should be suffer from cancel culture, it should be these clowns."

2021-05-20 21:19:22,wallstreetbets,I thought its cuz they figured out the so called source came from 4/8 chan and the whole thing turned out to be made up. I know they also got a couple grand from that lawyer by pretending to be one of the sexual assualt victims. They called him and he said he will give them money if they will testify or announce to the media they were a victim and obviously they didn't and stole his money.
2021-05-20 21:34:28,wallstreetbets,"As far as I know the claim is somewhat legitimate and even by all fact checking accounts could still very well be true, it's just that it's just as likely a fabricated story coming from the DNC' pocket for defamation"
2021-05-20 21:34:40,wallstreetbets,Let's just say.....your orders getting filled
2021-05-20 22:07:15,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget it was an anonymous person that started the whole thing.

According to anonymous, it was from anonymous.

However, according to anonymous, it was from anonymous.

Are anonymous and anonymous the same person, a persona anonymous created to fool anonymous? Or is anonymous really anonymous? Or did anonymous just take credit for something anonymous created, and he convinced anonymous of its importance? How do we know if anonymous, anonymous, and anonymous are even real? It could be a trick to distract us from the real author of the dossier, unknown.

These are the questions that are difficult to answer when the media runs with unverified anonymous sources."

2021-05-21 11:20:34,wallstreetbets,"You're speculating more than a bit here. No disrespect, but from what you wrote, you don't have a grasp of dynamics or the components involved. But that's okay. These auto manufacturers employ teams of engineers that spent years studying this stuff. Did you know you have to take Calc I, Calc II, Calc III, and Differential Equations just to take a precursory Dynamics class? Some engineers will then go on to specialize their entire careers on these suspension components. 

As a side note, the lack of performance from the Endurance at Baja had nothing to do with suspension or ride quality from sprung/unsprung mass. LMC simply grossly underestimated the energy required to traverse sand. One can perform the same experiment by taking a walk at the beach. Is it easier to walk the firm sand near the water or far off in the sunbaked dry sand? 

As embarrassing as it was for them, realistically, Lordstown fleet customers are unlikely to have much use for wide open throttle in desert sand."
2021-05-21 14:49:40,wallstreetbets,"I only took Calc I (as an elective... enjoyed it for some odd reason). I don't claim to be familiar with the math so going from a very simplistic approach. I think the basic physics are what they are even if you lack the math knowledge to measure it.

Here is some data I could pull from the SF250 which may shed more light on this.

A typical trophy truck would have completed that 40 mile stretch in 35-60 minutes (I think about 50-70 mph). They put out around 850-900 hp (maybe more).

Kyle Seggelin, took an off-road 4 runner and swapped a Nissan Leaf motor in (which puts out about 107 hp) and using an otherwise typical off-road truck setup averaged about 20 mph on that 40 mile section (took about 2 hours).

The Endurance supposedly puts out about 600 hp using the all wheel drive. It completed that 40 mile stretch in about 2 hours at an average speed of 20 mph.

We can speculate all we want, but the fact is, that regardless of their miscalculation of the energy usage, the Endurance with its 600 hp averaged the same speed over the 40 miles as the modified 4 runner with 107 hp. Neither is close to the top speeds. For the 4 runner, well it simply lacked an engine with sufficient power, but for the endurance either the guy driving was an idiot or there was something about the way the truck is built that prevented it from going faster (heck, it went the same speed as a truck with a lawnmower engine). I am going to stick with what seems to make sense to me that it was primarily due to issues with unsprung weight (as the performance aligns with that expectation).

I agree this is speculation on my part (as to unsrprung weight being the culprit) and I agree that the SF250 is mostly irrelevant for anyone buying a truck, but the concerns about unsprung weight are what they are and they have not yet shown a vehicle that performs properly."

I know the tax law before I even do the RE deals or make the trades.  Unfortunately I am in the top tax bracket.
Not to try to roast you or anything but
People who call them ""loopholes"" are usually the media and broke people. I know I used to be one.

My other points are my explanation for why i believe gross margins won't stay as high when/if they get to producing enough volume."
2021-05-21 10:24:26,wallstreetbets,"""herp depr it's not a car company"" is not a justification for the value, because:

A - It's still massively overvalued, regardless of what market you put it in.

B - It's a car company.

> most Auto Companies haven’t sunk a fraction of the costs that Tesla have into clean energy or even electric vehicle technology

Ehhhh, not quite true. Renault and Nissan have invested comparable amounts into their own EV divisions. Since most companies are working on an open standard for charging, they don't need to sell their own chargers or infra, they can rely on the industry standard. Tesla has to sell their own because they're going with the Apple route of having a special snowflake charger. That's cool and all but **they do not make any profits from their energy products or utilities, those are losses they eat to sell cars**.

> Tesla heavily out performs its competitors when it comes to money invested in driverless technology

I've addressed this in another comment. Tesla are not the only people who provide level 2 advanced driver assistance.

> clearly ahead on clean energy

They're not *anywhere* on ""clean energy"", they don't actually produce their own solar panels, they simply assemble them and stick their logo on. They ""produce"" solar panels the same way autistic gamers ""build"" computers, they are not a solar company. As for batteries, it's a similar story, they produce only a tiny quantity of batteries, and they are not the only company in the world that researches batteries (look at Schneider Electric). They're ""ahead"" in the minds of redditors who don't read anything but Tesla PR, take your head out of your ass and start talking to people in the energy industry. Competitors don't bother exceeding 200km range, because the added cost is not worth the additional range to consumers. 200km is basically good enough, it's not a question of being ""behind"".

Let's pretend that everything you've said is correct. Would that still mean that Tesla sells all cars sold in the world for the next 10 years? Because that's what their current valuation would require.

Keep drinking the kool-aid all you like pal, ignore the competition all you like. I've bought my TSLA puts and I'm very happy with my results to date.

**Bottom line is this, and you retards don't seem to understand this: I am not saying Tesla is a shit company, I'm ASSUMING that it grows into the top 3 auto makers in the next 10-15 years. Even if they become the most successful car company in the world, and sell more cars than Ford, BMW, Nissan, and Toyota combined... the current share price for Tesla is too high.**

You retards don't seem to be smart enough to understand the nuance of what I'm saying so I'll give up on this thread. The stonk market is *slightly* more complicated than ""hurrr rdurrrrrrrr company good so stonk go up more"". It is entirely possible that a company is guaranteed to grow, but still be overvalued.

Fucking retards, whatever, keep buying, the P/E ratio is only 800 now, what a bargain..."
2021-05-21 10:43:37,wallstreetbets,"> The driverless/autonomous side particularly sets Tesla apart in my opinion

OK, let's pretend that's true. That still makes Tesla overvalued as shit. If we assume they sell 90% of the cars sold in the world... their share price is still too high. This is not a question of ""Tesla good"" or ""Tesla bad"", or me claiming they're not going to grow like they claim they will, the car market is simply not big enough to justify their share price as it is today.

> I don’t know any other car manufacturers that are actually developing that technology

Then you should shut the fuck up and start doing some research before spouting useless, uninformed opinions. Literally every car company is working on *advanced driver assistance* (that's what they call it, since ""self-driving"" is a fucking pipe-dream that only retards fall for).

> Tesla is the only one out there right now,

Uhhh no, again, every big car company is working on advanced driver assistance, some Volvos can park themselves, and overtake on motorways, just like Teslas.

> Autonomous cars will take over from drivers and once again Tesla is the winning horse in that field

A - Fully autonomous driving is a pipe-dream. I say that as a software engineer with a masters in AI. Tesla themselves are backpedaling on self-driving claims.

B - Tesla have only reached level-2, just like Volvo and Nissan.

https://www.telecomtv.com/content/automotive/canalys-8-of-new-cars-in-europe-sold-with-level-2-autonomy-driving-features-36247/

Have you done literally zero research on this? I'm not even going into the latest research here, this is fucking basic shit...

> EVs will take over from petrol

2021-05-21 10:36:48,wallstreetbets,"If you don’t want to buy the stock don’t buy the stock, and don’t worry the ‘nuance’ isn’t lost on me that’s why Tesla make up less than 2% of my portfolio, I’m simply giving you a reason why they should be valued at $100 a share which is what you originally asked, stop crying over valuation and be happy you made some money, there’s too many bitter people in this game you don’t have to be one of them"

Valuable? Hardly. Talented? Insofar as Trump is talented in marketing himself. Musk has been nothing but marketing and that is entrepreneurial  no doubt.

PT Barnum did it better way before him. Bernie Madoff or Charles Ponzi did bilking way better before him.

Yet, he does it and succeeds so he has his place. Just nothing special about his thoughts or opinions or ideas 

I've been hearing electric cars and spaceships for decades. Many attempts have been made and many more are being made. It's just the government is backing it more now due to politics, nothing altruistic there."
2021-05-21 01:22:22,wallstreetbets,PayPal made him peanuts compared to government contracts from current endeavors. But then you knew that. PayPal was a good service and genuinely his own. This other stuff... none of it original. I mean good for him to bilk taxpayers and morons out of their money I am all for it but it doesn't make him a genius. He hires engineers to do the work while he makes sad attempts at being relevant.
2021-05-21 10:47:32,wallstreetbets,"I'm not bitter, I'm just tired of explaining to cultists why Tesla can be simultaneously be a ""good company"" and still be massively overvalued. At $100, Tesla would still be overvalued.

Your ignorance of their competitors is the clearest signal I need for why it's so overvalued. I'm more confident than ever that Tesla's future has been grossly overestimated by people because they're unaware of competitor products."

20 years ago there were EVs that were not golf carts.  Credit card processing on the internet is useful, but again this is not a novel **technology**.  GM was working on self-driving cars in the 1940's.  He is integrating technological advancements not necessarily authoring them.  

I don't think that is relevant in the long scope of history.  Everyone knows who Louie Pasteur is.  I doubt anyone remembers who the first dairy producer to use the pasteurization process was nor would they call that 'shaping history'."

Evs are more than just hooking a battery to a car and saying look ma i got an electric car. Motor development, battery tech, charging infrastructure.

That might not be the case in the future but it is the reality we are living in. 

You want to claim anyone else is making constellations of satellites. I hear a lot of talk but no one elae has one. 

You are having a problem seeing reality for what it is.  I'm not saying he didn't take government money but a lot of other companies did too and  they didn't make it. The same government funding that tesla got so did a dozen other companies. Solyndra ring a bell? 

Oh you weren't talking that government money? How about ford, gm, and dodge getting bailed out in the 80s when they couldnt compete with toyota and honda. Cant forget 2008 when gm and dodge got bailed out. Your logic is fucked."
2021-05-21 14:17:50,wallstreetbets,">Motor development, battery tech, charging infrastructure. How quickly you morons pretend all that existed before him.

Lithium ion batteries (1991), electric motors (1800s) and chargers (1800s)?  What, in your opinion, is his contribution to those?  I think you mean the charging station not infrastructure which is nothing special from an engineering standpoint.  The charging infrastructure is the electric grid itself...

I never claimed companies are making constellations of satellites, but funny you point that out.  In reality we have SpaceX, Planet Labs, Spire Global, Iridium Comms, OneWeb, Intelsat, ORBCOMM, EUTELSAT and many more with constellations of satellites.  In total there are 1,613 different entities that own/operate commercial satellites.  

The guy integrates technology that obviously already exists.  I can't remember a ton of integrators in the past getting credit for shaping history, which is the topic in this thread.  Is he very skilled at integrating in a disruptive way?  Totally.  He's a very good marketer and your rabid rant is a great example of how skilled he is.  

I don't understand how the government subsidizing other companies has anything to do with this.  Lately Elon focuses his businesses on things that will earn government subsidies and/or contracts.  You're really this upset over a disagreement about how influential someone is?  That's not good dude.  Hope you feel better."

You could prob sell the $10 ones ahead of ex-divy (depending on current price) then buy more if it does drop. It's just what I'm doing, not advice or anything.

2021-05-21 01:35:47,wallstreetbets,Then how about you do it too 🌝
2021-05-21 01:19:02,wallstreetbets,"Brokers don't assign the options. The Options Clearing Corporation randomly assigns exercised options. Robinhood did not exercise your call unless they bought your call. Someone, somewhere bought an AMC 6/18 6c and decided they wanted to exercise their right to call away your stock. They can do so at any time or not at all.

Of course, you now need to purchase said stock 


AMC won't go much higher and the selling of stock will probably net more than selling their option to close so it makes sense to call it in now given current stock prices."

2021-05-21 02:09:16,wallstreetbets,Things not always happen according to the textbook. Also not make sense to maximize the profit. Your profit is less than just resell the options

2021-05-21 02:45:20,wallstreetbets,"> Your profit is less than just resell the options

Not necessarily but probably true at the moment. They may believe it'll go up some more and want the stock on hand to sell for max profits. At the current price points I don't see why they wouldn't close the option but who knows? They want the stock now for some reason. Is there a dividend on it? Maybe it's taxes reasons shows as a wash or loss but they still own the underlying asset. I don't know."
2021-05-21 02:50:11,wallstreetbets,"All I am saying is it doesn’t make sense to maximize the profit buy exercising and then resell. Even if the stock price would go up, the option will worth more. And they can always resell the options to close the position. That’s why I highly suspect it’s done by Robinhood if it’s not done by mistake"

2021-05-21 01:49:24,wallstreetbets,"Shit logic. Even at $20 game stop was overvalued. It was a dog shit company that deserved to be shorted. You really think gme is worth 170 or more now? Ridiculous. People don't understand that it was mostly fomo buying and holding that ran up the price. It only stopped because of the great fuckery that Robinhood and other brokers pulled. Both gme and amc could have went ALOT higher. The reason amc or gme will squeeze is because of the buyers and holders. Same logic used here to why a certain shit voin with a dog on it rose to .7. value of a company does not matter. What matters is retail buying it like a hive mind and never selling. Its amazing how fast you retards forgot that lesson from GME.

2021-05-21 05:52:52,wallstreetbets,"I am not sure where you think I said GME was properly valued at $170.

I don't think your last paragraph is true. Knowing the fundamentals is what will keep a bunch of people from bag holding. Neither of these companies are worth their current prices so it doesn't make sense to own them unless you accept it is a pure gamble. Same as a lotto ticket. If people would admit that this is pure gambling and using less than a couple % of their portfolio then it is all good. Adds some excitement. But, anyone that is putting all their money into these at these levels are just plain dumb. Could it work? Sure. Likely? No.

In regards to shorting, I think it is dumb and has probably blown up more accounts than it has made. There is a saying that the market can be irrational longer than you can stay solvent. People are going to go broke shorting either one of these.

Also, it needs to be said that not everyone will get paid even if the squeeze happens. Only enough people to cover the short shares of the HFs that are margin called."

Base effects are adding about 1%, PCE is the only metric the fed watch or care about, so I guess on the whole, if 30% extra costs to build a house because of steel and lumber are offset by everything else, net inflation is still really low , so no worries.
Markets are pricing forward, the yield curves and commodities futures all point to lower inflation, so I agree with you.  Was just trying to point to places where one can start to look for data"

Money supply and interest rates are the common tools of the fed, but there are others or they’ll find new ways. Just pretty sure that US cannot afford higher rates because debt is refinanced with debt and it would cost so many jobs that then again would force populists into politics and we go again. We went Down that road many times, there has to be another way"
2021-05-21 03:11:32,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn’t this depend on if you’re debt is paid on variable interest or fixed interest? 

If fixed, then inflation is okay. Everything costs more but you can also park your savings in a savings account. Maybe it’ll even earn enough interest to keep up with debt payments. 

If variable and in hyperinflation, your BigMac costs $100,000 but instead of paying $15,000 in interest a year on your loan, now you’re paying $150,000 interest a year."

Lol you boy has your house and has putting it on the line against Tesla 
He must think we're going to go back to gas and away from EV bc I just realized, I just bought a ford VW A CHEVY A PORSCHE A FISKAR A LUCID A POWER WGEELS JEEP FROM MY CHILD HOOD.
One problem now, I'm on the road, far from home like you know 1 hour and its middle of winter. I'll even keep my location, I don't lve in the most populated city in America. 
I would like to go home but I have  a real problem. I bought a car that cannot be charged anywhere but where ever I am.  So if your friends all have nema 14-50 220v outlets right outside by the curb like all of mine do,...... you’ll be fine , but if you don’t , we’ll then you’ll be doing credit swaps too with the Tesla dealer on a trade in , full disclosure , I bougbt a Tesla for my wife using Tesla proceeds the. At 3000 it split , I said to my self what the hell these guys make140 cars a day Vw made that many whe. Yoh got the the second sentence  Tesla loses money on there cars every other automaker profitable.
What gives?
Oh that’s right a Tesla is now a status symbol that of Mercedes and bmw .
Oh wait thAts not DD however here is some, if yoh want to drive an electric car, underhand yoh are either buying a Tesla or your driving on an extension cord that’s half the range if it’s 95 degrees out of that battery.

If it’s 10 degrees out, we’ll , good luck to you . 
Why are these car companies  not seeing that you can just deliver electricity to gas stations or requires infrastructure, and that’s fine maybe they can build them out quickly but how quickly Tesla is worth more the. All the companies combined 
You can outspend them , they do it without looking , oh look another loss this quarter , perfect stock should pop 20 percent that means .

The service is like the worst you have w ever seen or heard of.
150k car no loaners , Uber credits lmaooooo.
And they come back like it’s crack for share and for cars.

Dr burry - maybe if it was 2008 maybe if we didn’t ha eacxess to the info yoh did then now as regular people 
Maybe if yoy had an EV maybe if you drove around califonaoa which I believe he lives in, you would rwlIe one thing .  Tesla’s are not the only electric cars , they are the only ones people buy if they don’t want to compromise and change them wntire lives based on their cars single charge range .
Imagine I still couldn’t drive to east coast to Miami from NY and not have to go out of my way and not using all the range to keep filling up.  If yoi buy any other EV amd fbat cross Bronx expressway is like  the 5 or the 10 in Cali during rush hour and it’s December 23 , I hope you are either a yankee fan or a fan of beautiful Nj because that’s where tou will get to .  And then to get back , we’ll AAA can come with a gallon of gas to get you to the station that won’t work maybe they can come and tow you to an iPhone charger aomehweee and you can plug in and on NYE you cna get back to your house which was 2 subways and a quick LIRR ride. And then you call dr burry and say can I ha e some money back from my mortgages you made a fuckin killing on Bc my apartment building doesn’t have an EV charger well it does but it’s Tesla only .  
The guys a genus I’m. Jerk off I get it , but he had what one good call and made billions while banks lost and the clients , all the home owners lost there homes instead of getting to keep your house maybe some money back no dr burry made banks sign solvency contexts or be paid first . 
WhTs going to happen here the stock goes to 0 and EVs are no longer the future lol.  This bet will pay out millions foe him I’m sure but if you smart and your a real trader like him yoh j ow you’ll be out of there maybe even on the other side rifbt or wrong .

But the issue here is not the compa y it’s the product the infrastructure and only amazo. And Tesla are tremdendipus companies who were laughed at and my favorite filled with corporate ignorance 


Sure and Jeff bezos was selling used books..... at finite margins and no room for error and crazy logistic to get it done 
Jeff bezos brilliant but not Elon musk brilliant he didn’t change the worlds view on shit except he exploited how lazy us  Americans are is all.
And they ga e 75 -100 cargo planes amazon prime millions of vans and trucks and trailers and maybe one day more planes the. FEDEX  AND UPS .  I don’t see anyone shorting UPS . You think amazo. Will over take them ? I’m sure that actually could but that would be stupid like buying a. Non Tesla EV h less you ha e a predetermined daily commute and plan to use another vehicle for any trips longer the. 100-120 miles 

Then there’s those times you have e no idea where on earth yoh are the gas stations are closed and you panic, we’ll that’s now your daily situation except your down the block from work and everytbings open

Like I said he’ll make million short term, that’s abojt it.
And if he’s lucky Elon musk doesn’t tweet anything 
Kind of ironic the fund is called Scion LOL.
I too rmeber the largest automaker owning a compa y and car called that  too and now the largest automaker makes 4. Cars made to order amd Witb no options the worst service and no loaner cars and they love it 
That’s a little different t the. Offering mortgages to people who can’t afford them 
Quite the oppsiorw that’s shorting mortgages of people that can afford the. Did the homework and Can refuel outside of their driveway 
But what do I know 
Not As much as the good doctor who made more by putting those head lines out through the biggest financial platforms ,using terms like “big shorts fame and The most famous short .  Duh any idiot trying to be really late to the party is going to join thag move and just like in 2008 you’ll ha w no house no account and burry walks aaay Witb all of it and the. Buys Tesla stock

2021-05-21 08:59:43,wallstreetbets,"So looks like Ford is using the Osborne effect;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne\_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect)

Basically ICE car manufacturers hate electrics. Their dealers hate it. Their workforce doesn't know how to produce them

So F decided to build 20k of their electric F150 out of millions of cars they produce every year... why? to do the same shit Microsoft did back in the day.

New innovative company comes on the horizon with product A... so Microshit will annouce product B exactly like A but better and ""to be released at a later time"".

Consumers would wait for B... meanwhile the new company is killed and fails and Microshit picks it up.

Sounds familiar here? we need to spread the word as this is BIG. Bigger than GME... this is about the future of Tesla and other EV makers.

If a company like Ford is willing to use a very destructive Osborne effect to not only try to kill off a very small competitor but also have this grenade backfire on its own sales of the ICE F150, which I guess they try to mitigate by only targeting fleet owners and a ridiculously low volume in 2022, then it shows the DESPERATION. They are willing to resort to illegal tactics and borderline mafia methods. Every dirty trick in the book short of ordering hits on CEOs of those EV competitors.

Tesla slipped through the cracks but the legacy shitmakers have a noose for every other startup out there. They realized the existential danger and while Tesla is 600:1 on its valuation there's plenty of nascent EV car makers that are where Tesla was in 2006... and the ICE cabale understands it's now or never to kill them off. Not make the mistake they did with Tesla again. And the Hedgies as well as complacent ""analysts"" will help them. After all a short and distort campaign is sophisticated by very design.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short\_and\_distort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_and_distort)

And maybe if Tesla ends up being the ONLY one left kill it off slowly too by death from a thousand cuts.

We cannot let that happen. Millions of diamond hands need to buy RIDE today and skyrocket it to $100 at least..."

2021-05-20 22:27:42,wallstreetbets,"I get that, but your comment is in reference to the market I’m talking about just sheer ridiculousness. it’s not about winning or losing it’s about common sense. 

What I’m talking about has nothing to do with the market it has to do with life in general. If you have no fucking idea what you’re doing, and it involves enormous risk take the time needed to learn about the topic or find someone that’s willing to guide you in the right direction (those people that make up 5% of the people on Reddit) who are willing to help you learn and point you in the right direction via resources and *****basic***** common questions.

There’s some good people on here who will literally spend 10’s of hours of their precious time trying to help someone who knows absolutely nothing about this topic, and they’ll provide them with resources and info to learn the knowledge needed to do this shit, and with no personal gain for themselves, and the person taking such advice can fact check it after the fact.

Other people are fucking sheep and they come on here not knowing *****anything***** about the market not knowing *****anything***** about day trading just following everyone else hell a lot of them can’t even distinguish something that’s complete and utter satire (which his comment clearly was) and to reply to such a comment saying 

“how can I enable options and buy calls on everything “I just changed my settings now what” 

It’s astonishing. Firstly the dude wasn’t even talking to him he was having a conversation w someone else, and was making a joke, and some guy who creeps this sub literally responds thinking it’s real and follows everything he says without knowing anything about him or the topic, and not realizing it’s a joke.

Like do yourself a huge fucking favor if you know so little about a topic that you can’t distinguish a joke from real life then don’t creep on a sub you know nothing about and risk your money. If this was a health sub his joke would translate to stocks to health like him saying to smoke 5 packs of cigarettes a day to improve cardiovascular health, and the guy who has no idea on the topic responds being like okay I just bought a carton of cigarettes now how do I smoke them? 

You can’t make this shit up lol"

2021-05-21 01:08:46,wallstreetbets,More importantly Ericsson didn't go down.
2021-05-20 20:36:04,wallstreetbets,You can’t die from ass burgers
2021-05-21 12:08:08,wallstreetbets,When does that occur?  When the next inflation numbers come out or months down the road?
2021-05-21 14:18:09,wallstreetbets,Perhaps the June fed meeting
2021-05-21 01:30:29,wallstreetbets,"How is it going? I finally added positions 12 @ 233.08. Hopefully, it stabilizes and steadily rises to 300.00. Did you adjust your technical analysis? If so can we get another DD?"
2021-05-21 09:49:45,wallstreetbets,"I just re-ran the analysis and Q2's average daily volume is 39% above Q1. I have adjusted by forecasts (i.e. the table in the post) to slightly to account for a modest 10-25% increase in Q2 over Q1. Current price target estimates point to \~$470 assuming a PE ratio of 40 to 50.

&#x200B;

I will provide an update at the end of june (Q2 end). Two days ago, coinbase witnessed a record high in trading volume, and I'm unsure if it will sustain for the remainder of Q2.

&#x200B;

Edit: $233 is an awesome starting position. I would average down if coinbase cannot find stability. My average now is \~296 i believe"
2021-05-21 12:12:09,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the insight
2021-05-21 01:34:42,wallstreetbets,Did you average down or waiting for a bounce? I got it at 233.08.
2021-05-21 19:28:16,wallstreetbets,Updates? Looking bright
