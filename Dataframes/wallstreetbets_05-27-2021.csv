2021-05-27 19:58:16,wallstreetbets,I spent 1k in SP500 puts can’t recommend this but who knows... But in the end the bull fucked me and i liked it
2021-05-27 19:50:34,wallstreetbets,"I’ll take it, however I can get it 🤙"
2021-05-27 19:37:55,wallstreetbets,"I own 1,500 contracts at .99 for the 9.50 strike for next Friday expiration"
2021-05-27 19:31:39,wallstreetbets,Holding Jan 2023 $40 calls for hopefully a huge run over the near term and the coming year

2021-05-27 19:46:51,wallstreetbets,Balls
2021-05-27 19:32:27,wallstreetbets,Most I’ve got is 20k right now
2021-05-27 19:57:38,wallstreetbets,"I hope you get very, very rich."
2021-05-27 19:50:33,wallstreetbets,"No, but I have my baby 60 12C contracts expiring next week @ .23 average closed today at .48 so I’m not unhappy"
2021-05-27 19:40:30,wallstreetbets,truly magnificent!
2021-05-27 19:51:01,wallstreetbets,$40 is big cajones!  Best of luck :)
2021-05-27 19:58:27,wallstreetbets,"Dude, You got balls.  To the moon🚀🚀"
2021-05-27 19:35:11,wallstreetbets,Nope
2021-05-27 19:39:18,wallstreetbets,"A little too soon for my risk tolerance, but I sure hope we are way higher than 10.5 by then"
2021-05-27 19:48:17,wallstreetbets,"Love the risk to reward on these far dated contracts, gives me a ton of time for $BB to spike and can still move extremely quickly with price moving up."
2021-05-27 19:58:44,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the love, I have faith these contacts will go to $10+"
2021-05-27 19:51:21,wallstreetbets,"A 100% gain is a 100% gain, hoping those go ITM soon!"
2021-05-27 19:52:30,wallstreetbets,"I don't expect to hold these till expiration, maybe a year or so before Theta starts to eat them. Doesn't have to go ITM for some big gains. I have 18 months left on these contracts, DFV v2."
2021-05-27 19:39:54,wallstreetbets,This is decent DD… while I savor the AMC hold I will invest new $ into GE… for the boomers that are no longer with us.
2021-05-27 19:31:34,wallstreetbets,Exactly GME to the moon.
2021-05-27 19:35:37,wallstreetbets,Clearly the letter M is missing from this ticker
2021-05-27 19:42:51,wallstreetbets,TLDR: $GME 🤩
2021-05-27 19:57:19,wallstreetbets,You spelt GME wrong
2021-05-27 19:55:52,wallstreetbets,"I’d be more confident saying Tesla would become an energy giant than I would saying GE would provide significant gains. 

I’m installing panels on my house with geo-thermal, and I’m sure that’ll be much more standard in the coming years. I’m also doing this because I love Tesla - so pretty biased here"
2021-05-27 19:28:00,wallstreetbets,Double down. Buy. Hold. Sell. Buy more.
2021-05-27 19:24:03,wallstreetbets,"Me and only me, I sold all my 40 dollar call and bought 20 dollar for next week :) shit tone"
2021-05-27 19:33:53,wallstreetbets,This can half just as quickly as it doubled.... Take some profits and gamble the rest.
2021-05-27 19:44:48,wallstreetbets,"This is where it gets tricky. Share price is crazy high,  option price is crazy high. This is now the FOMO area. Where people are left holding bags. If anything. I'd buy shares. But only if morning volume is still extremely high,and in a clear uptrend."
2021-05-27 19:52:59,wallstreetbets,What app is this?
2021-05-27 19:24:41,wallstreetbets,Take the win. Don’t double down.
2021-05-27 19:46:56,wallstreetbets,"I’m pretty new to options honestly, and never made this much in options ever.. I legit bought these this week lol, and this still has so much room for growth. Was thinking of calls purely because of how much I’ve made from these Yolo ones but the shares may be a safer bet... thx!"
2021-05-27 19:49:20,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino!
2021-05-27 19:55:26,wallstreetbets,"The problem with options,  is how much they cost now.  Look at what the breakevens would be tomorrow.  I wouldn't be to confident how much this can run either. It took 700 million in trading volume to go up 10 bucks.   This isnt a squeeze. This is sheer mass buying."
2021-05-27 19:49:01,wallstreetbets,Buy more shares this rocket still has a lot of fuel in it.
2021-05-27 19:59:50,wallstreetbets,Good points. Thank you!

2021-05-27 19:45:04,wallstreetbets,LFG !! 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-27 19:38:48,wallstreetbets,BB has all time high short interest right now. The most shares ever short in the history of the stock.
2021-05-27 19:29:16,wallstreetbets,I’m ‘baiting whether to play it safe and play with BB or Yolo and go all in with AMC. I do have FOMO about AMC which is why I might just stick with BB
2021-05-27 19:30:42,wallstreetbets,"Accordin to puja Tayal: less than 10% of BlackBerry’s shares outstanding have short interest, leaving little room for a rally. The stock surged as much as $11.73 on May 26. Redditors won’t buy the stock at a higher price unless they are sure that they have enough short sellers to buy BlackBerry stock for a premium. I don’t expect the stock to go above $14 in this squeeze."
2021-05-27 19:23:48,wallstreetbets,What’s in the pipeline which would validate that movement?
2021-05-27 19:33:06,wallstreetbets,As a side note Reddit needs to make the up arrow green
2021-05-27 19:34:16,wallstreetbets,Blackberry short interest is higher now than in January
2021-05-27 19:26:06,wallstreetbets,Money go brrrr
2021-05-27 19:26:35,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry has the services the market wants with IVY and QNX, they need to succeed in selling and some revenue growth, which from the recent 10Qs, they are starting to get a better vision. QNX can be in almost all IoT devices, ALL"
2021-05-27 19:35:55,wallstreetbets,Hope so
2021-05-27 19:38:20,wallstreetbets,For the January run it was about 7% today I'm seeing about 9%

2021-05-27 19:40:25,wallstreetbets,"Well done, they should loose even more on #AMC and #GME.

2021-05-27 18:56:58,wallstreetbets,Meant to say “bombed my interview”. This lack of detail is probably part of the issue 😭
2021-05-27 19:32:46,wallstreetbets,Shit bro you're not getting that job if you bombed the interviewer
2021-05-27 18:57:49,wallstreetbets,Are you for sure that you bombed it?
2021-05-27 18:59:03,wallstreetbets,You've probably made more than your interviewer anyways. Here's an award.
2021-05-27 18:56:26,wallstreetbets,You don't need to work anymore

2021-05-27 18:56:01,wallstreetbets,"My cost basis was like 20-50 bucks for each of these, but too complicated to capture a shot of as I sold them. 

I think they were long term cap gains too, but my AMC history is a clusterfuck. 

Still holding on to a deep ITM contract for potentially more gains. I’m more of a GME meme guy though. 

Fucking engineering interviews expect you to be fast and smart... at least I can still make money as a retard buy buying memestonka amirite"
2021-05-27 19:09:39,wallstreetbets,Nice now you can buy a nice suit so next interview you don’t even have to talk!
2021-05-27 19:34:59,wallstreetbets,Where can I learn what a contract is and how to make 4k in one day lmaoo
2021-05-27 19:41:37,wallstreetbets,Those first 4 words are Sus AF.
2021-05-27 19:52:48,wallstreetbets,Not a bad day at all 👍
2021-05-27 19:31:08,wallstreetbets,Lol!  Those mundane details will always come back at you.
2021-05-27 19:14:33,wallstreetbets,The bar is pretty fucking high so no most likely. I think there is a chance but not holding my breath.
2021-05-27 19:16:16,wallstreetbets,Haha at least today I did! Thanks for the award!
2021-05-27 19:14:55,wallstreetbets,If GME would hurry the fuck up this could be true!
2021-05-27 19:15:47,wallstreetbets,My biggest weakness is selling too late. Working on resolving that.
2021-05-27 19:15:25,wallstreetbets,I’ve been doing better with retard trading moves than the job honestly. So you’re not entirely wrong
2021-05-27 19:36:05,wallstreetbets,Explain middle management to me then...
2021-05-27 18:58:49,wallstreetbets,* by buying

2021-05-27 18:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Haha, I'm always impressed with 20s something with this much cash. I'm 44 and had nothing like savings until mid 30s. Bravo"
2021-05-27 18:44:44,wallstreetbets,Looks like you have unallocated cash?
2021-05-27 19:24:22,wallstreetbets,Congrats dude!  I maxed 250k at 29.  -3k at 30.  2000 sucked.  You are properly weighted for your age.  Keep it up

2021-05-27 18:45:12,wallstreetbets,I think you’re doing it right! Haha
2021-05-27 19:51:46,wallstreetbets,How did a 26 year old get that much?
2021-05-27 19:12:39,wallstreetbets,Lmao. Im 26 and have a similar portfoloi. My percentages are a little different- 84% gme and 16% amc
2021-05-27 18:45:51,wallstreetbets,Fuck. I’m jealous.
2021-05-27 19:17:01,wallstreetbets,Please switch the ratio to 69% $GME and 42% $AMC
2021-05-27 19:35:30,wallstreetbets,How does your 401k account allow you to invest in individual stocks?  401k's only allow funds as far as I'm aware of.
2021-05-27 18:59:38,wallstreetbets,"Probably not.  If you retire at 27, you’re gonna be bored AF for the rest of your life."
2021-05-27 18:45:56,wallstreetbets,"I mean it’s pretty dumb when this thing retracts but hey, I’m sure you will do fine."
2021-05-27 18:48:38,wallstreetbets,"Had all that money been in AMC you would have almost doubled just in shares, let alone options"

2021-05-27 18:55:19,wallstreetbets,"He has rich parents,c’mon"
2021-05-27 19:50:22,wallstreetbets,Yours must be a restricted 401k.
2021-05-27 19:56:07,wallstreetbets,"Vanguard offers within my 401k a “Self directed brokerage fund”, which allows you to send a balance to a TD Ameritrade account. It’s restricted because is still a 401k, but I can trade stocks but not options with it. Check if your plan allows it."
2021-05-27 19:15:44,wallstreetbets,"My 401k also is just dumb Vanguard funds. But at least with company matching, I basically get free 80% gains for every dollar I put in."
2021-05-27 19:45:43,wallstreetbets,Bad take. You’d have the time and money to take up any hobby you wish.
2021-05-27 18:54:38,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the FUD, you snek.  


You have anything to contribute to this conversation other than fear?  We're coming for your tendies."

2021-05-27 19:14:35,wallstreetbets,It’s a 401k dude
2021-05-27 19:12:26,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily.  Somebody who starts investing right out of school can get there.  I wasn't (I finished school at 24), but I was within 5 years of getting out of school."
2021-05-27 19:54:22,wallstreetbets,Damn...I would retire in a year if I could use it.
2021-05-27 19:49:42,wallstreetbets,Our company switched from Schwab to Vanguard a few years back. I dunno which company heads got blow jobs to switch but now our options suck big hairy donkey balls.
2021-05-27 19:32:06,wallstreetbets,401k's are the Government's way to ensure u pay higher income taxes when u retire. That's why it is deducted tax free now. So when (if) you make it to retirement age they can count on your income tax (which will be higher) till you die.
2021-05-27 19:42:07,wallstreetbets,Yea same with matching but I would rather be able to take the maybe 35 k it would of been and yolo that shit.
2021-05-27 18:59:06,wallstreetbets,"I mean, every short squeeze stops somewhen? 

It’s not FUD, it’s realism, I hope it does go up more, but you’ll make multiple times the number of hedge funds richer than you’ll put out of business."
2021-05-27 19:40:24,wallstreetbets,"I am aware of little tax plays right now. Can you school me. So I deduct the money I put into the 401k every ye right ? I think I did but not completely sure .

Edit nvm: u mean it goes in before being taxed??"
2021-05-27 19:04:49,wallstreetbets,"This isn't a short squeeze.  This is Citadel getting it's hand caught in the cookie jar.  We're coming for their fucking yachts.  This never goes down until heads roll or we get paid.

The goal is not to bankrupt all hedgefunds.

Hedgefunds engaging in illegal naked shorting have diluted the value of your dollar.  They're stealing from you in plain sight.  


Just like my erection, this is never going down."
2021-05-27 19:46:41,wallstreetbets,"You don't need to deduct anything, your W2 will show the cash going into your 401K and you will only be taxed on your gross less 401K contributions."
2021-05-27 19:47:24,wallstreetbets,"Sorry edited my verbiage.  Yes, you don't pay taxes on the money now. You pay taxes when you retire and draw from your 401k. I do minimums. Whatever ivy league genius thought up 401k's really put nails in our coffins by the added enticement of a company % match."
2021-05-27 19:06:58,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I vibe with your point.

But you realise most almost all citadels positions are profitable? 

Plus how do you know it’s Citadel shorting this stock?"
2021-05-27 19:12:09,wallstreetbets,"Why are you even posting here? Go home, snek."
2021-05-27 19:14:06,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I like what I’m seeing and I still have a position in GME, but my point remains, how do you know it’s citadel. And are you not frustrated that this will make many more hedge funds richer?"
2021-05-27 19:16:54,wallstreetbets,"Why would I be angry that other hedgefunds jumped in to help the apes save their movies and video games and that they made a lot of money doing it?

Citadel was standing over the fainted corpses of AMC and GME as the pandemic closed in, their fate seemed written on the walls and the vultures descended.  Carnivorous titans walking the financial world surrounded them and began to pick at their flesh.

But the apes stepped up and started carebearstaring their cash into their once lifeless corpses.  The heroes rose to their feet one last valiant time.  The fight scene usually plays out a little differently after this happens."
2021-05-27 19:19:14,wallstreetbets,"You really think other hedge funds care about the average investor? 

And citadel didn’t stand over them, it brought the portfolio from the short company at a very comfortable price tag.

I agree that what they did was wrong and it should be illegal, but then again, I short several companies and sure as hell will short robinhood the moment it comes and ipo’s"
2021-05-27 19:21:08,wallstreetbets,"I see nothing wrong with short selling in general.  This is not a moral crusade against short selling.  For some, that may be the full extent of this.

  
For me this is personal.  They cheated.  I hope they get caught.  And I hope we get paid."
2021-05-27 19:22:30,wallstreetbets,"Depends if you sell or don’t I guess, all short squeezes retract, it’s a squeeze for a reason, and amc is at GMEs market cap now so who knows.

But go the Chinese company that sold at a massive profit"
2021-05-27 19:31:15,wallstreetbets,"but what?  That last sentence does not parse into ape.  


You don't think they saw exactly what was coming, and just how volatile this was going to be?  Why would they risk that investment in an american company where the outcome may very well rest in the hands of the corrupt american El-ites?"
2021-05-27 19:35:14,wallstreetbets,"Sorry to interrupt but, you are a moron, if you really think what you wrote. Remember, not an ape, a complete moron."
2021-05-27 19:36:51,wallstreetbets,"I'm so much dumber than that.

You can't insult me more than I can insult me so stop trying, you dumb snek.

If you have anything to contribute beyond attacking me personally, carry on.  If not, suck fat smelly ape weiner."
2021-05-27 18:49:45,wallstreetbets,"All on margin?? 
Damn bro. Join the ape community and make some
Money"
2021-05-27 19:34:51,wallstreetbets,Ask for a refund
2021-05-27 18:45:18,wallstreetbets,I feel the pain with Tell and F myself right now.  Thankfully I have been able to roll mine up and not lose money to do so.
2021-05-27 18:47:16,wallstreetbets,Bought $25p for early July I think tomorrow might me tasty.
2021-05-27 18:44:25,wallstreetbets,"Rolling the calls costs me $1700 because I fucked up on a few and increased the price instead of just rolling the date to break even. Got a put to cover for the correction but IV is going to kill me more than likely if it doesn't drop tomorrow.

Congrats and fuck you all that held."
2021-05-27 19:03:50,wallstreetbets,"All I did was roll last weeks $10c into $15c until it was over $25 a share. Then I paired a couple of 15’s off and made them 20’s. But a month out. 
The 4000 share in sittin on like mother hen did well too YaY me!  And I fuck myself once a day. Good for the prostate."
2021-05-27 19:13:05,wallstreetbets,I think you can gamble with 1-2 month OTM puts on $20 and less if you have some money left to cover some losses.... still it is dangerous since these are put‘s lol
2021-05-27 19:37:32,wallstreetbets,"I’m a newbie at investing and I’m using Robin Hood as an entry app. People are saying that Robin Hood sucks but I want to know what app I can use to buy calls and contracts like this. It seems like the smarter play since I’m a “safe” investor. 

Please help this fellow ape. Is it Fidelity?"
2021-05-27 18:55:19,wallstreetbets,"Margin account but it is all actually cash.

fidelity wants 8% on their margin so I am not fucking with it unless I fell like doing blue chips and selling CC to pay of the interest. 

Honestly selling CC on Spy would be fine but I don't have enough in the account to do it."
2021-05-27 19:10:01,wallstreetbets,What is the advantage to rolling multiple times?  If it drops hard tomorrow/next week you want the calls to be short dated so they drop faster.
2021-05-27 19:41:44,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity is good their mobile takes some getting used to as it isn't as easy to set up trades and takes a little longer but I did all of this on my phone.

If you have only a few K in cash Robbinhood gives you access to options that Fidelity won't allow."
2021-05-27 19:42:59,wallstreetbets,So I have 4K for now. Those are things like Limit Orders and Stop orders?
2021-05-27 19:50:43,wallstreetbets,"umm no. 

limit orders and stop orders are strategies that are used when setting up a trade. They themselves are not options.

2021-05-27 19:51:24,wallstreetbets,"I’ll be looking into that, thank you"
2021-05-27 18:42:23,wallstreetbets,What are the chances that it will be the same tomorrow? :)
2021-05-27 19:09:06,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you!! Well done!!

2021-05-27 18:47:44,wallstreetbets,I'm retarded.. what does this mean
2021-05-27 19:25:45,wallstreetbets,"Is there a problem selling call options the same day they expire? Not talking about theta but will you even be able to find a buyer? I’m a rookie, thanks"
2021-05-27 19:17:07,wallstreetbets,Time to jump on over to SPCE for the real rocket ride! To the moon 🌝 and back! 🚀
2021-05-27 18:39:32,wallstreetbets,"Retarded question... why did the share price change? You bought the options at 1.08 a share correct? And the you closed your position at 12.17 a share?

Also nice job!!"
2021-05-27 18:43:17,wallstreetbets,And that is how it is done!
2021-05-27 19:10:25,wallstreetbets,Very nice!

2021-05-27 18:45:25,wallstreetbets,Do you think the climb continues? Everyone is negative that it’s going to level back down
2021-05-27 19:31:34,wallstreetbets,I’m in space and no one will hear me scream when the boosters kick in.
2021-05-27 19:09:30,wallstreetbets,Option value grew
2021-05-27 18:46:56,wallstreetbets,I really hope it continues 🤞
2021-05-27 19:26:15,wallstreetbets,Personally I think there might be a dip tomorrow but I might buy more once the dip sets in. June 18th is the big day with all of the $40 call options. The short squeeze hasn't started yet. Short interest is continuing to increase
2021-05-27 19:50:23,wallstreetbets,"If it dips, we double down. 

*This is the way*"
2021-05-27 18:24:15,wallstreetbets,why are the letters so mixed up on your screen?

2021-05-27 18:20:23,wallstreetbets,That’s why the price dropped.

2021-05-27 18:24:23,wallstreetbets,What about it? Is there any reason why it would skyrocket? Catalyst?
2021-05-27 18:47:38,wallstreetbets,Wow!! Very nice 👍🏼

2021-05-27 18:10:33,wallstreetbets,The only way!
2021-05-27 18:12:20,wallstreetbets,That's what she said!
2021-05-27 18:42:04,wallstreetbets,"Because the media is trying to add to the stocks we back, and some are falling for it. They want to dilute our power. 

Together strong has real meaning behind it."
2021-05-27 18:42:55,wallstreetbets,This!
2021-05-27 18:20:20,wallstreetbets,I am kicking myself not averaging down when it was sub 20.  Fucking tax bill killed any large average down play.  Debating going in now or wait for a slight correction. I don’t think it’s going sub 20.
2021-05-27 19:20:36,wallstreetbets,For real she said that!?
2021-05-27 18:26:43,wallstreetbets,"I agree. 20-20.5 will act as support since some huge players bought a boatload of pltr shares during the dip !
It could slightly correct in the short term, but nothing at the level we've seen in the past month."
2021-05-27 18:26:04,wallstreetbets,I doubt you sold and already posted before. Show us the status in a month
2021-05-27 18:00:28,wallstreetbets,How much have you made so far? I’ve just seen gains this past week.
2021-05-27 18:01:15,wallstreetbets,"Hot dog! Nice, my leaps were +20% but i chose to hold, now -20% lol"
2021-05-27 18:03:47,wallstreetbets,It is time to see it at $21 again
2021-05-27 18:16:51,wallstreetbets,Sell before June 11th! Inflation / CPI data of May will be released and since April CPI data was worse than 2008 don't expect June CPI data to be good. And nothing has crashed the stock market more than inflation FUD last couple of months
2021-05-27 19:35:48,wallstreetbets,I didn’t post before. I posted the position last night and this screenshot is what I sold today.
2021-05-27 18:01:05,wallstreetbets,I don’t share my balance and profit/loss sorry.

2021-05-27 17:57:46,wallstreetbets,Did you sell?
2021-05-27 18:06:51,wallstreetbets,I bought 1/23 $12 leaps at the  end of last month when it was trading just over $11. Doing pretty well rn myself.

2021-05-27 18:04:34,wallstreetbets,"Sorry man.

Missing out on investments I'm not watching (like AMC today) is alright. That's something I wasn't originally planning. Something that I've been eyeing... that hurts a little, but overall fine. But missing out on a confident investment but missed the fill.. that makes me mad :-("
2021-05-27 18:02:22,wallstreetbets,"I more than doubled my position around 14.40 for a higher strike and a full month for expiration. I'm expecting this to slowly climb through June (EV Tax highlights). The Michigan Senator is doing great work lobbying for Ford and GM. 

My targets for the next month are 16\~17."
2021-05-27 18:12:38,wallstreetbets,Congratulations on your win and on a beautiful entry price too. Are you holding strong through the summer?
2021-05-27 18:06:39,wallstreetbets,"I feel you, I got in on the AMC train possibly at the ass end. I'm not sure. I netted 2 grand from AMC. I'm a super baby APE. Though considering I doubled my cash today between AMC and a couple other calls, I really can't complain."
2021-05-27 18:02:52,wallstreetbets,"if it’s good enough to screenshot...

best of luck to you

I sold my $F calls at a loss two weeks ago. Expiring next year. Oops."
2021-05-27 18:16:19,wallstreetbets,"Not sure yet. I scalped them for like $2.20 and it’s already more than doubled. I really like what Jim Farley is doing over there, and I think they’ve got a good shot a giving Tesla a run for their money. It seems they’re making all the right investments in all the right places, I’m excited to see how it turns out."
2021-05-27 18:06:06,wallstreetbets,I played their earnings too a few weeks ago - just chump change but that didn't go too well with the supply shortage issues. I'll share the next screenshot with both my positions if it goes well :-) thanks for the luck
2021-05-27 18:22:11,wallstreetbets,"[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-panel-advances-ev-tax-credit-up-12500-2021-05-27/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-panel-advances-ev-tax-credit-up-12500-2021-05-27/)

Here's a little boost of confidence. Currently, Ford still qualifies under the <200k limit; this new bill (if passed) would boost the $7,500 EV tax credit to $12,500 (for Ford bc their cars are both built-in USA + have labor unions). In its current form, this would help both GM, Ford, and Tesla. Even if it's modified for a smaller tax credit or amount of vehicles, Ford is reaping the most benefits here. Something to look out for."
2021-05-27 18:25:18,wallstreetbets,"I too noticed this, heard also that Tesla is about to lose their tax credits soon due to a moratorium that was in place."
2021-05-27 18:28:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, Tesla will have some chop. They have a lot of great events in June so more towards the bullish side but there is a heavyweight on this EV tax bill. Luckily Biden is EV friendly but we'll see how Congress responds to it :-)"
2021-05-27 17:25:49,wallstreetbets,Your first mistake was listening to Cramer
2021-05-27 17:29:30,wallstreetbets,Never give importance to Cramer.
2021-05-27 17:25:02,wallstreetbets,"I saw Jim Cramer the first time on the Iron Man movie.

I seriously thought he is just an actor, hired to make that scene.

Imagine my surprise when I found out he is a real and has a real money show."
2021-05-27 17:59:56,wallstreetbets,He wants to add more to the meme stocks. Goal is to take our money away from AMC and GME. He wants to dilute the pool so we have less power.
2021-05-27 17:24:59,wallstreetbets,Did you set a stop loss order?
2021-05-27 17:28:08,wallstreetbets,Cramer is never right unless he’s giving advice to rich friends off the records even then he’s full of shit
2021-05-27 18:29:46,wallstreetbets,"Cramers a crook, but the stock is legit. 1/4 the valuation of Tyson Foods. When have you seen someone tagging a Tyson Burger? ... they are not only right on trend, they are transforming a commodity in a brand product ... you’ll be fine"
2021-05-27 17:26:34,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is a con artist. I am sure he was positioned to make tendies before he said anything yesterday. Self gain crook.
2021-05-27 17:45:25,wallstreetbets,Could he be getting to deflect our dollars and Interest from EMC ? bYND is heavily shorted but it’s expensive.... let’s keep focused
2021-05-27 17:32:56,wallstreetbets,It’s been roaring the past week.
2021-05-27 17:35:37,wallstreetbets,You listen to that cuck? Ok
2021-05-27 19:47:09,wallstreetbets,"Well, he’s either right or wrong?"
2021-05-27 18:34:36,wallstreetbets,Bought $180 calls today at the bell.
2021-05-27 18:05:47,wallstreetbets,I work for a freight brokerage and Beyond Meat is one of our customer. They have a lot in the pipeline and we move 10+ truck loads of finished product and ingredients a day. And we ain't the only brokerage/freight company they use. Its definitely a good bet!
2021-05-27 18:02:50,wallstreetbets,He’s WRONG!  I’m watching live and I cannot believe the hosts on CNBC - Jim Cramer right now - continue to falsely claim BEYOND MEAT is a WSB target. No wait…I can believe it. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)
2021-05-27 18:19:20,wallstreetbets,"What is wrong with y'all.  This is a huge bet for me.  Also the market cap of AMC, BYND, and GME are all 10 billion so there's plenty of firepower to go around.  The short interest of BYND has nothing to do with AMC and GME.  I'm trying to find the next thing BEFORE it pops."
2021-05-27 17:32:08,wallstreetbets,Why's the man so disliked for?
2021-05-27 17:37:21,wallstreetbets,"You'd make more money shorting Cramer's recommendations.  


Unless he recommends lobster futures"
2021-05-27 17:33:42,wallstreetbets,It’s making a comeback
2021-05-27 18:25:47,wallstreetbets,Didn’t watch CRAMER. What were his comments on $BYND. I’m holding large in 140calls expire tomorrow. Like what I see AH...149+. Hope holds morrow. Again what did CRAMER say?Thanks. Regardless of what people think of Cramer they buy into what he says.
2021-05-27 17:31:54,wallstreetbets,Lol good luck
2021-05-27 18:15:59,wallstreetbets,Off of Jim Cramer tip?!? Your brain is not smooth my friend
2021-05-27 17:34:27,wallstreetbets,He gets his news from this place 😂. By the time he recommends a hot new Reddit stock red is soon to follow
2021-05-27 17:59:01,wallstreetbets,He was right about wish watch what it do
2021-05-27 19:17:41,wallstreetbets,I’ve got fucked listing to Cramer a few times.
2021-05-27 17:47:17,wallstreetbets,"Second was, believing in him after listening.."
2021-05-27 17:56:20,wallstreetbets,I came here to say this! lol
2021-05-27 18:05:52,wallstreetbets,This!
2021-05-27 19:40:52,wallstreetbets,Exactly!
2021-05-27 17:38:35,wallstreetbets,what is the angry devil in your profile pic about?
2021-05-27 17:33:17,wallstreetbets,No I did not.  I just bought it today.
2021-05-27 19:51:49,wallstreetbets,Every money manager is like that...  Or maybe he should buy a stock and say that it's bad?
2021-05-27 18:31:28,wallstreetbets,100%
2021-05-27 17:49:50,wallstreetbets,Bear -Stearns for starters
2021-05-27 17:36:31,wallstreetbets,Bruh how are so many people so uninformed. Cramer works against us
2021-05-27 19:05:07,wallstreetbets,Not always true. I got blasted shorting Roblox. Luckily I knew when to cover and buy my own shares to recoup the losses.
2021-05-27 19:48:10,wallstreetbets,"On the show Wed, he was saying how BYND could be the next short.  Also RBLX and I forgot the third one (will write if I remember).  Because BYND has a 20% short interest and it's a good company in general because of the deals it was making and how betting against BYND in the past failed."
2021-05-27 17:53:07,wallstreetbets,Third was using RobbingHood.
2021-05-27 18:05:47,wallstreetbets,"Third was using Robinhood to read the Cramer article, and believing that this is anything besides a distraction. 
 Hedge funds belive if they throw a ball we will chase it and change our positions! #AMC500k #GME500k."
2021-05-27 17:43:37,wallstreetbets,"His Twitter feed is always lively. 😂

He can't go a day without mentioning WSB."
2021-05-27 18:14:14,wallstreetbets,Fourth was not YOLOing on GME
2021-05-27 18:26:35,wallstreetbets,5th was posting it on WSB telling us this
2021-05-27 19:36:43,wallstreetbets,6th was thinking axe body spray would get you laid.
2021-05-27 17:23:35,wallstreetbets,Branson all my trust
2021-05-27 17:40:09,wallstreetbets,Up 226% on my call expiring tomorrow and happy :)
2021-05-27 17:27:40,wallstreetbets,On board
2021-05-27 17:29:01,wallstreetbets,Do you think it’ll continue to rise? I bought too high today and sold real quick but might get back in now that it’s dropped a little.
2021-05-27 18:01:45,wallstreetbets,"Have to sell my AMC, RBLX, or TLRY options to get in on SPCE. Don’t wanna do that yet. But good luck."
2021-05-27 17:41:27,wallstreetbets,Maybe ill buy some more tomorrow. This and clov are my 2 stocks. Hoping for more guys to come over and help squeeze clov because it's shorted like 40% right now.
2021-05-27 18:55:06,wallstreetbets,To the moon 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎
2021-05-27 18:43:47,wallstreetbets,Love the burn!!!
2021-05-27 17:29:01,wallstreetbets,Pullback tomorrow?
2021-05-27 17:49:40,wallstreetbets,"And Branson has already confirmed that he’s going through training for his own space flight.

https://youtu.be/BUi09sd9HsQ"
2021-05-27 19:47:04,wallstreetbets,Same here! 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-27 18:35:58,wallstreetbets,No reason to sell unless Branson comes flying back down to earth in an uncontrollable spin
2021-05-27 17:30:27,wallstreetbets,The short sellers have not cover their positions yet! If price stays like this we’re going to have a beautiful squeeze 🚀
2021-05-27 19:00:35,wallstreetbets,"our late day spikes have been put coverings from last weeks bets who thought the test flight would blow up. Shits not even close to over.

I remember performance's like this from GME in the late Feb-Early March secondary squeeze. The firms writing those contracts have every ability to hedge their losses across multiple weeks pushing squeezes out and slowing it down so its not completely out of control. You'll see what I mean over the next several weeks as random spikes occur in the last hour of trading, usually on weds/Thurs. I think the general rule is the position has to be covered 48-72 hrs after contract expiry. You do the math on that."
2021-05-27 19:58:02,wallstreetbets,In that case it’ll be some assembly required.
2021-05-27 18:00:37,wallstreetbets,How does a dumb ape like myself learn to read when shorts cover their positions/begin panic buying?
2021-05-27 17:31:15,wallstreetbets,Nice nice
2021-05-27 19:16:34,wallstreetbets,"This.

&#x200B;

Short interest was last reported at 20%-ish.  New shorts were helping to drive it sub-$20.  Cathie's exit gave them extra gumption to pull it off.

&#x200B;

If it follows GME's squeeze->gamma play, which the rise to $31/$32 almost follows the exact same script in early January then tomorrow could be a +90% return day.  Tuesday and Wednesday of next week would be absolutely epic for call chains hedging 0DTEs that turned ITM on the last day.

&#x200B;

Not advice.

&#x200B;

For the record, here's the Thursday-Friday that I am speaking of (date - open - high - low - close - adj close - volume)

Jan 22, 2021	42.59	76.76	42.32	65.01	65.01	197,157,900

2021-05-27 18:29:08,wallstreetbets,Ban
2021-05-27 17:36:38,wallstreetbets,Why is it not listed on Robinhood?
2021-05-27 18:26:08,wallstreetbets,And how do you know who the NDAs are with? I didn't hear that on that video
2021-05-27 19:00:40,wallstreetbets,I like the Sona. If it’s retarded enough for me it should be retarded enough for you.
2021-05-27 19:33:57,wallstreetbets,I've been bag holding for months help
2021-05-27 17:40:32,wallstreetbets,"You answered your question.  
TD Ameritrade is pretty cool especially  the think or swim app"
2021-05-27 17:23:34,wallstreetbets,"My calls are making me stupid money on the regular, which makes it super easy to buy stupid amounts of shares on the regular!"
2021-05-27 17:31:57,wallstreetbets,Yeah I fucked up and didn’t hold my 139 $12 for the 4th smh
2021-05-27 17:23:24,wallstreetbets,How many contracts is that?
2021-05-27 17:26:09,wallstreetbets,"What platform are you using to trade, need the change."
2021-05-27 17:56:48,wallstreetbets,What's the AMC price expected to hit if a squeeze happens?
2021-05-27 18:14:12,wallstreetbets,"Congrats!

PS: I made an audible ""ugh"" sound lol"
2021-05-27 19:10:21,wallstreetbets,Which would be better amc call 27$ june18 or the 40$ call? Which would make more? New to options.
2021-05-27 19:19:23,wallstreetbets,Will I have a problem selling call options on the day of expiration? Any advice is appreciated
2021-05-27 17:23:49,wallstreetbets,When you selling? Don’t know if I’m an idiot for selling today.
2021-05-27 17:34:49,wallstreetbets,That's some nice gains there! 💎🙌
2021-05-27 17:56:02,wallstreetbets,The will wait on it. Waiting  on the squeeze
2021-05-27 17:26:17,wallstreetbets,Lemme get some 😍
2021-05-27 17:24:30,wallstreetbets,"Thank god for amc, literally printed 100k in 3 days"
2021-05-27 17:24:11,wallstreetbets,I got 115 at the moment had to roll over a few
2021-05-27 17:28:53,wallstreetbets,that's fidelity.
2021-05-27 17:29:12,wallstreetbets,It’s fidelity
2021-05-27 18:01:13,wallstreetbets,No price target just watch the levels and once rsi and other indicators start to cool off I would sell
2021-05-27 18:48:44,wallstreetbets,Thank you! May we all be in the green
2021-05-27 19:35:08,wallstreetbets,"The 40$ calls are cheaper but much riskier, it’s up to you both options aren’t extremely expensive comparing to gme or other big stocks"
2021-05-27 19:36:01,wallstreetbets,"Your broker will automatically sell them if you don’t, I would recommend just selling it manually just in case"
2021-05-27 17:36:16,wallstreetbets,I’ll sell at around 500-1000 if the squeeze happens
2021-05-27 17:36:25,wallstreetbets,Thx playa
2021-05-27 17:26:45,wallstreetbets,Everyone wants to hate on the option chain..... and I’m all “do you not like money?” 😂.
2021-05-27 18:06:18,wallstreetbets,Apes alone weak. Apes together strong.
2021-05-27 17:36:34,wallstreetbets,Thank you
2021-05-27 17:36:43,wallstreetbets,Thank you
2021-05-27 17:40:49,wallstreetbets,If you’re in amc or gme right now I wouldn’t recommend switching in case we are close to the squeeze. Fidelity took around 2 days and a 75$ transfer fee for me
2021-05-27 18:10:32,wallstreetbets,"I’m watching the volume and MACD. MACD was above the signal line almost all day. Also, the red volume didn’t really out pace the green. I expected the drop at the end of the day. Some people don’t like to hold over night. Day traders jumping out. If I start to see red volume out pace green and MACD is dropping below signal, then I’ll drop out and buy back in at a lower price for a rebound."
2021-05-27 18:04:47,wallstreetbets,How to read? I’m a dumbass but want to learn how to trade so I can make nice gains too. Tired of working paycheck to paycheck
2021-05-27 19:40:07,wallstreetbets,"Cool, thank you!"
2021-05-27 17:37:06,wallstreetbets,But short volume is so low... what squeeze is left?
2021-05-27 17:45:36,wallstreetbets,I’m hoping my weeklies pop a little more tomorrow cause I have no idea what the fuck I’m doing
2021-05-27 17:51:00,wallstreetbets,"I just don’t get it, this ape is too smooth brain...and too poor to risk turning on margins on my Fidelity account.  I have options on, but don’t know how to buy them, especially for what little money I have to invest."
2021-05-27 17:44:23,wallstreetbets,Yeah your other firm charged the $75. If you transferred over 25k call fideity and they’ll reimburse you
2021-05-27 18:08:23,wallstreetbets,"For amc specifically, watch the live streams by Matt kohrs and treys trades on YouTube. They take it price by price and give great learning advice"
2021-05-27 17:44:40,wallstreetbets,They still haven’t covered a single short share and ortex just released a short squeeze single alert
2021-05-27 17:52:25,wallstreetbets,"Spend hours on YouTube and months losing money and you’ll become a pro, I guarantee it"
2021-05-27 18:10:28,wallstreetbets,Can their advice be used to trade other investment vehicles as well? I realize this AMC gravy train won’t last forever but I’d like to be ready for when the next run begins
2021-05-27 17:48:23,wallstreetbets,How? Outstanding short volume is 30% from float that could’ve been covered in a day like today. I think shorts are going to end up getting liquidated and it’s not going to pop more than 30%. Short volume could’ve been covered 6x today.
2021-05-27 17:58:08,wallstreetbets,"The fact that there was enough overall volume for shorts to cover today is really irrelevant though. Once they start to cover the selling pressure will get eaten up so fast and the price will start to fly. 

They're not going to sneak in 130M bought shares without the price skyrocketing just because people are day trading a volatile stock."
2021-05-27 18:00:47,wallstreetbets,The days to cover would take around 4 and we’re about to hit a gamma squeeze with the amount of call expiring itm. I guess we’ll just have to find out where this goes. I’m holding my calls until they reach my desired price
2021-05-27 18:07:00,wallstreetbets,I don’t see a squeeze till at least $30. There have been a bunch of $30 and $40 calls expiring in June bought this week. Today there wasn’t enough of an upswing for the squeeze. Stopped just short of $30 a couple times.
2021-05-27 18:07:55,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t the itm calls just get dumped once the shares are bought?
2021-05-27 18:50:27,wallstreetbets,"The more shares bought to cover options = higher price, higher price= more calls itm"
2021-05-27 18:57:57,wallstreetbets,Itm calls don’t bring buying pressure when the are bought at a lower price. It doesn’t help the current price.
2021-05-27 17:13:32,wallstreetbets,I’m literally the dumbest of all dumbest dumb fucks!
2021-05-27 17:19:42,wallstreetbets,"I read a post on a guy who put all his money into cockroaches, trust me it can get worse"
2021-05-27 18:03:37,wallstreetbets,I’m down 6 K on wish.
2021-05-27 17:20:08,wallstreetbets,I wish you luck
2021-05-27 17:23:26,wallstreetbets,Looks like Cutler plays
2021-05-27 18:17:32,wallstreetbets,What about the guy who did 360K in 412P 5/28???
2021-05-27 17:15:45,wallstreetbets,I bet you are not.
2021-05-27 17:38:13,wallstreetbets,Lmao! Thanks for putting a smile on this face
2021-05-27 18:40:38,wallstreetbets,Wtf is WISH?
2021-05-27 17:37:30,wallstreetbets,Thanks man!
2021-05-27 18:45:19,wallstreetbets,Something I wish I never bought.
2021-05-27 19:13:36,wallstreetbets,Agree!! But I have more invested in my vanguard account. Bought 150 shares at $27 and change. Then bought another 400 or so at $8.08
2021-05-27 17:07:15,wallstreetbets,There no rumors or news right now... am deep ball into bb but we will continue on the hype till next week
2021-05-27 17:11:19,wallstreetbets,Blacker the berry sweeter the juice 🚀
2021-05-27 17:05:01,wallstreetbets,What rumor?
2021-05-27 18:07:31,wallstreetbets,All my money is in AMC 😂😂.. not selling!! I wish I could buy BB!!!
2021-05-27 18:40:05,wallstreetbets,Dumped my AMC like a ppr boi. Add to my BB holding?? Asking for a friend.
2021-05-27 18:16:50,wallstreetbets,Fuck it. I’m about to drop my last 150 DOLLARS on BB
2021-05-27 18:18:47,wallstreetbets,R u selling them
2021-05-27 17:38:54,wallstreetbets,Where do you guys get the data that pushes you to a certain stock? Everything go bet on either freezes or shits the bed and I lose. It's stopped me from putting real money into this game.....
2021-05-27 19:00:10,wallstreetbets,"what if I told you, I never pulled out...."
2021-05-27 17:06:15,wallstreetbets,BB to the fucking Moon 🌙
2021-05-27 19:15:59,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-27 18:38:07,wallstreetbets,I put my last 2 hundo into amc during the last dip of the day and I think I might actually regret it
2021-05-27 19:17:38,wallstreetbets,I sold my 5/28c & picked up some 6/4
2021-05-27 18:18:58,wallstreetbets,It’s all about entry
2021-05-27 18:10:46,wallstreetbets,#not your fault.  You have bagholder genes
2021-05-27 18:05:46,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the solid DD.
2021-05-27 18:45:05,wallstreetbets,No regrets it’ll be higher tomorrow
2021-05-27 18:39:19,wallstreetbets,Why? Rumor has it the squeeze hasn’t even started yet
2021-05-27 19:58:37,wallstreetbets,But how do yall know where to enter :')
2021-05-27 18:46:56,wallstreetbets,"I honestly think it will. I'm half and half on AMC and GME and the only thing that stopped them from going up more was market close. If not, sell on the way down and still rake in a good profit."

2021-05-27 17:05:25,wallstreetbets,Let’s go to the moon
2021-05-27 17:53:55,wallstreetbets,"Tilray's stock held the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) as support and regained the 21-day EMA as well. Tilray's stock should continue to rise and the eight-day EMA will cross back above the 21-day EMA, which would be very bullish.

Tilray's relative strength index is registering at about 50%, which is very comfortable for the bulls because it has a lot of room to move higher before going into overbought territory.

Bulls want to see the eight-day EMA cross above the 21-day EMA as they continue to push Tilray's stock over resistance near the $17 mark. If the stock can regain that level, it has room to move up toward the $20 level."

2021-05-27 18:41:48,wallstreetbets,TLRY is looking really really nice!
2021-05-27 19:02:10,wallstreetbets,"I like that it broke 17 today even with 14,000 open interest. The fact that aphria is now with them as well just basically means fans of one are fans of both. So much volume today as well. contract sellers are busy elsewhere, the week of reckoning"
2021-05-27 19:55:21,wallstreetbets,Let’s goooooo!!!!!
2021-05-27 17:07:28,wallstreetbets,"Love the TLRY action.  Got in at 6.60 - 25000 shares - kicked myself for not selling in 60s.  Sold at 30.  Started buying back in - now have 33,334 shares at $22 Ave price.  I think we will hit 20s in June and back above 30 this summer.  Maybe a lot higher."

2021-05-27 19:23:01,wallstreetbets,"Jealous of $25, Bag holding since 2018 and wasn’t paying attention in Feb. This now has my full attention! Go TLRY!!!"
2021-05-27 17:16:13,wallstreetbets,"I only have 200 @ $22. I’ve got limited funds for stuff like this. I figured I would buy and hold for the long haul. I’ve been tempted to buy more again and again during this low period but I’ve been hesitating because it’s the worst performing stock I own. 

Not financial advice, but why are you holding so much?"
2021-05-27 17:51:45,wallstreetbets,I have checked the loft the plants are doing well. The high is coming.
2021-05-27 17:49:45,wallstreetbets,"You’ve gotta be kidding me, right?"
2021-05-27 19:32:27,wallstreetbets,"i have 875 shares and i am ready!

2021-05-27 18:31:14,wallstreetbets,"I’m on this one too. People think of the past. They don’t see the changes and improvements they have done. By the time a lot of people do, they will have missed the big part of the ride."
2021-05-27 17:31:27,wallstreetbets,I got 200 @ $16. Made decent gains last squeeze and bought back later. Long position of course!
2021-05-27 17:18:39,wallstreetbets,normally I can count on going short on natural gas every summer.  This year it blew the fuck up in my face like a hesitant new recruit on the grenade range for the 1st time.  Ive never seen natural gas behave likeit this time of year
2021-05-27 18:54:12,wallstreetbets,hey this is actually really interesting lol which is refreshing since i havent seen anything interesting on here since feb and the gme bullshit. fk yeah.

2021-05-27 17:54:38,wallstreetbets,Bro the stock has been $10 to $12 the past 4 years. It’s going nowhere. It didn’t even move shit along Biden’s campaign lol
2021-05-27 17:37:02,wallstreetbets,Inflation is an explosion just waiting to happen in Nat Gas!
2021-05-27 19:08:34,wallstreetbets,"Thanks.

I only heard about WSB right after GME hit 400. Was some of the funniest shit I've ever read, as the newbies were getting roasted. Myself included of course. 

I'm just getting the hang of reddit trading now. Got in on SPCE, NOK, UWMC, PLTR, which are all green. Just brought BBBY today, and am hoping CRK will be my first DD to become a meme stock. Next step, FDs until I'm broke.🤣"
2021-05-27 18:05:42,wallstreetbets,CNN has AMC at $3.70.
2021-05-27 18:45:12,wallstreetbets,They look good to complete their recovery from March 2020. Not enough shorts to squeeze but is a good investment all the same.
2021-05-27 17:57:46,wallstreetbets,"It's been consolidating for 4 years. This is a very bullish sign as the shorts haven't been able to budge it. Now, with NatGas set to explode, it's going to the moon. Upside breakout imminent."
2021-05-27 18:47:13,wallstreetbets,"Got 35 $20 calls — 1/21/22, Im hoping you are right. Plus shares, but it’s WSB so you know."

2021-05-27 18:41:21,wallstreetbets,"Noob question, you’re obviously in unrealised profit today, but if GME doesn’t hit that price tomorrow, are your calls worth jack shit?"
2021-05-27 16:54:37,wallstreetbets,Why is it ending tomorrow?
2021-05-27 16:52:16,wallstreetbets,No one else is selling bud

2021-05-27 18:38:35,wallstreetbets,F
2021-05-27 19:14:11,wallstreetbets,"Correct. And even worse, GME needs to be higher for me to make a profit. GME needs to be over 192.5 ($182.5 GME price + $10 price I paid per stock to open the contract. A contract has 100 stocks.
1. I paid $1000 to open a call option that expires 5/28
2. I can sell or exercise the option anytime.
3. Below are the possible outcomes:
If <182.5, go YOLO on the next Option, do money hands and sacrifice a wallet/money clip.
If >182.5 but <192.5, in this range my profit is in the negatives
If >192.5, pretend i knew all along 💯🙌, go YOLO on next option"
2021-05-27 16:57:27,wallstreetbets,They’re holding a 5/28 call
2021-05-27 16:57:56,wallstreetbets,His call expires tomorrow
2021-05-27 16:59:05,wallstreetbets,It’s a call
2021-05-27 16:59:27,wallstreetbets,Ah understood. Sorry I'm not into options yet so I totally missed that.
2021-05-27 16:59:20,wallstreetbets,Ah understood. Sorry I'm not into options yet so I totally missed that.

2021-05-27 16:52:20,wallstreetbets,Snagged 10 5/28 30p today on that rip to 30. I think tomorrow MM’s take y’all to the wood shed but it’ll bounce again. Plenty of money to be made on volatility here.
2021-05-27 18:34:47,wallstreetbets,"what is your definition of ""to the moon"" ? like $50 per share? $300 per share? $2000 per share?"
2021-05-27 19:46:50,wallstreetbets,"HEADS UP- If they GAP up the price of $AMC in the morning, that will signal the funds will be dumping on the retail crowd that will FOMO into the morning market!! Expecting a huge sell-off tomorrow as the funds and power traders take profits before the long weekend 😁"

2021-05-27 18:06:35,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I think MM’s are gonna drop it like a rock tomorrow. Brought a crap ton of puts expiring tomorrow with pocket change."

2021-05-27 18:00:38,wallstreetbets,Sorry I speak English not sure what you are saying.
2021-05-27 18:50:07,wallstreetbets,"Trevor Milton was the scam artist and Nikola appears to attempting to continue with the original vision. 
Can they succeed probably not but they sure as heck are trying to right the wrongs."
2021-05-27 19:08:38,wallstreetbets,I switched over to cashapp I have a fidelity account too
2021-05-27 17:33:57,wallstreetbets,Which app is better?
2021-05-27 16:42:42,wallstreetbets,Buy high sell never
2021-05-27 16:45:29,wallstreetbets,Why would you sell AMC....you should buy more when it dips to $26 range.  I eat crayons don’t listen.
2021-05-27 16:48:27,wallstreetbets,Would you rather buy at $27 or $107?
2021-05-27 16:46:10,wallstreetbets,I would hold amc through next week at minimum
2021-05-27 16:45:58,wallstreetbets,If you're only talking 4 shares then just keep it
2021-05-27 16:48:37,wallstreetbets,"Idk about you, but I’m going to keep on buying until it hits 100 then just ride those shares to fucking Pluto. I’m jacked to the TITS"
2021-05-27 16:47:03,wallstreetbets,Invest in AMC. Buy and hold..
2021-05-27 16:45:26,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you're ripe for a promising gambling addicti - erm - I mean, *hobby!*

YOLO that shit right into whatever meme stock you like best!"
2021-05-27 17:18:06,wallstreetbets,Sounds like your looking for Financial Advice here.  Not qualified to offer financial advice here
2021-05-27 16:45:31,wallstreetbets,"Now I'm no expert, but amc is lookin kinda THICCC



(Nah but seriously, I reckon it's not too late to invest in amc, it's going TO THE MOOOOONN)"
2021-05-27 16:42:39,wallstreetbets,"""Hi I'm retarded"""
2021-05-27 16:46:34,wallstreetbets,STAY IN AND HOLD.  HELP MAKE THIS THING POP.  IF ANYTHING BUY HIGH.  DONT INVEST WHAT YOU CANT LOSE.  TOO THE 🌕🌕🌕
2021-05-27 16:46:55,wallstreetbets,"AMC seems to be getting ready for lift-off so I would definitely suggest keeping your 3.99 shares as they will theoretically become very valuable in the near future.  Indeed, you have sufficient resources, buying in now might make sense, too.  Yeah, I know we are in the mid- to high-20s range, but if this hits $1,000, $10,000, $100,000, $1M per share, will it really matter that you got in at the mid- to high-20s range?"
2021-05-27 16:50:05,wallstreetbets,"I honestly don't know what level this will reach, and nobody else does either.  If you say $1,000 per share, folks will laugh at you and say, ""no way, the floor is $1M!""  I do not think it will reach $1M/share, but if it did, I'd be thrilled as well as many others, too."
2021-05-27 16:54:07,wallstreetbets,This is the dip
2021-05-27 16:56:55,wallstreetbets,Okay I emailed to change it
2021-05-27 17:18:21,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell higher, and put on your shades cause the sun is bright above the clouds 😎 ☀️"
2021-05-27 19:06:25,wallstreetbets,WeBull allows full access to pre market and after hours.
2021-05-27 18:35:17,wallstreetbets,"Been holding 158 shares since late January early February. Just yolo’d and bought another 40 shares today at 24.42 usd. It ain’t much but gotta fuel up the rocket ship. We are going to the moon after all. Buy buy buy. This is not financial advice. I’m a retard with some spare capital, don’t listen to me."
2021-05-27 18:39:48,wallstreetbets,When to sell AMC after this bullrun?
2021-05-27 16:44:38,wallstreetbets,You could sell it while it's high and buy back when it's low.
2021-05-27 16:49:33,wallstreetbets,"Really depends what your goal is, but over all just throw as much money as you’re willing to at low prices and hold for a looong time until it’s prices skyrocket. 

You might want to try buying every week, putting more in at lower prices and less in at higher prices, and don’t panic sell!"
2021-05-27 17:18:27,wallstreetbets,Bcrx is the one man
2021-05-27 18:48:40,wallstreetbets,Just hold through. Those shares will be able to be a down payment on something that will change your life
2021-05-27 18:13:53,wallstreetbets,Buy high go long
2021-05-27 16:58:50,wallstreetbets,I bought the dip final 15🚀🦍
2021-05-27 16:51:41,wallstreetbets,Bought more at the dip 27$ 🚀
2021-05-27 16:48:59,wallstreetbets,The problem with op is RH. If op buys more and is on margin. Technically that goes against us cause we know what rh does with shares on margin.
2021-05-27 18:34:09,wallstreetbets,Let the FOMO kick in at 40 dollars!
2021-05-27 16:48:36,wallstreetbets,"Haha maybe it wasn’t clear but I’ve only put in a total of 120 into RH, I’ve made that back and have reinvested everything else to grow to 430. I didn’t know if it sounded like I’ve just kept adding more in"
2021-05-27 17:25:20,wallstreetbets,Fair enough
2021-05-27 17:38:35,wallstreetbets,I agree. It’s still affordable right now at cost per shae for anyones income or buying power and it’s literally going to blow past $40 soon
2021-05-27 18:37:35,wallstreetbets,This week is fomo + ape purchasing. Next week is share count + free ride to tendie town. You’ll thank yourself for holding those shares in 2 weeks.
2021-05-27 16:59:07,wallstreetbets,He belongs here
2021-05-27 16:43:23,wallstreetbets,"I won’t deny I’ve not made the best choices, but I was hoping the apes could help me"
2021-05-27 16:49:56,wallstreetbets,Biggest problem with op is the RH broker. Shares could be given away if on a margin account. Make sure it’s cash and then buy away!
2021-05-27 18:52:12,wallstreetbets,HELLL YEAH! Lemme know what their reply is. I’ve seen HILARIOUS replies from RH customer service!!
2021-05-27 18:52:48,wallstreetbets,"Also, were you able to find out what account you were on? Cash or margin?"
2021-05-27 16:46:54,wallstreetbets,What is sell?
2021-05-27 17:05:13,wallstreetbets,Even i know thats fuckin retrded \*shits pant\*
2021-05-27 16:52:13,wallstreetbets,I have no idea what that means but I’m gonna figure out how to check
2021-05-27 16:57:01,wallstreetbets,It’s like buying on credit....almost.
2021-05-27 16:58:17,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, and rh (which owns your account) can sell them off if it’s in their interest. Messaged op in a chat regarding the difference between the two"
2021-05-27 16:59:05,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t he first get margin called? I don’t know if they sell it automatically or not
2021-05-27 17:00:30,wallstreetbets,There were posts all over the place the last time it fluctuated with people pissed that rh wouldn’t let them sell or buy at the prices they were at due to it being margin. And apparently they switched peoples accounts without them knowing. And when you sign up some of the users reported being put on margin automatically before having to contact and have them switch it
2021-05-27 17:31:10,wallstreetbets,Just a play by Exxon for people to think they are moving to more clean energy. I work in the oil and gas industry too. Just my opinion
2021-05-27 16:45:43,wallstreetbets,"Hi, I'm just a lurker here, but I would love to know what the people here think about this article.  
  
It appears that some 'activist investors', led by a hedge fund called ""Engine No. 1"" managed to place at least 2 directors on Exxon's board for the purpose of forcing Exxon to go more clean energy. Is this the only real way to force big companies to change, or is there something I'm missing here?"

2021-05-27 16:41:29,wallstreetbets,I'll let the jiggle factor touch me in my no-no square.
2021-05-27 16:41:52,wallstreetbets,Are you buying or selling the indicated put?
2021-05-27 18:13:29,wallstreetbets,"Good idea because they popped big on the last earnings, not sure if it would pop again but I like chewy so let’s go"
2021-05-27 16:43:41,wallstreetbets,"Low IV is relative. 

Some opportunities are showing up where current IV is 20% and earnings runups peaks at 60%. 

Downside is low open interest which usually means high spread."

They have to buy shares to stay delta neutral when they make market selling calls. I know that’s probably more than your brain can manage, but buying calls is another thing that forces them to buy shares."

Hope you all had nice gains today and best of luck out there, play smart!"
2021-05-27 16:27:54,wallstreetbets,This is good stuff.
2021-05-27 16:55:54,wallstreetbets,Monday? Markets are closed for Memorial Day. How accurate is this stuff for gamma squeeze?  This works for stocks that have lots of attention?
2021-05-27 16:24:29,wallstreetbets,So do I sell and buy again in a few days?
2021-05-27 18:11:22,wallstreetbets,Can you put this in layman's terms for a dipshit. Should I buy more AMC tomorrow?
2021-05-27 16:39:22,wallstreetbets,Here's hoping. Bought some $11 calls and have 100 shares. It's not much but I'd love to see it follow AMC the last few days haha
2021-05-27 17:34:58,wallstreetbets,Ganggg

Break the sell button so it doesn’t work"

2021-05-27 16:11:37,wallstreetbets,So u are a lil bitch for securing profits?
2021-05-27 16:10:16,wallstreetbets,What the plan is for tomorrow? 🤔
2021-05-27 16:10:50,wallstreetbets,You can never go broke taking profits. Af least you made money!
2021-05-27 16:13:39,wallstreetbets,"You made a profit. Diamond hands didn’t, at least not today."
2021-05-27 16:10:12,wallstreetbets,"Its just starting to go up, don't paper now!"
2021-05-27 16:14:54,wallstreetbets,"Don't be a bitch, nobody has gone broke from taking profits. I secured almost 100% profits today and am letting the rest ride out. Don't fomo back in when it hits 50 and lose everything"
2021-05-27 16:11:03,wallstreetbets,"Hindsight

A ton of people on here are going to get left the holding the bags (again), and I can guarantee it won’t be the people taking profits"
2021-05-27 16:13:16,wallstreetbets,Load up on some more calls to make it up?
2021-05-27 16:16:54,wallstreetbets,Don’t bit urself up just learn from the experience and better ur mind to be a strong diamond hands because it a not even started yet believe me. We will reach 500000 k just hold we are strong together
2021-05-27 16:34:56,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you something about the initial investment off the table thinking: it's pure crap. 

Think of it as water, what do you get when you mix new money with old money? Right, fucking money. 

Whatever your balance is as of this moment it's in the past, the question is: what are you going to do with it going forward? 

If the reason for investing remains for your risk tolerance, you should buy more or hold. If not, you should sell. You can do it in parts because no one can predict the top or the bottom, but you don't take away some money and leave the rest to rot. End of rant."
2021-05-27 16:40:37,wallstreetbets,"Never complain about pulling profits to cover initial expenses. Sometimes you don’t time it right, but think about what would have happened if it fell apart and you didn’t pull profits. If it would’ve fell apart after you pulled profits you’d walk away happy that you got to enjoy the ride and didn’t go broke. You played the odds and you still can’t see it as a win?"

This run is just beginning... $10 soon"
2021-05-27 16:21:38,wallstreetbets,It's only trading around what it did in february. And yeah there's some good news about them. But I'm concerned with that kind of volume and volatility that there might be issues tomorrow. Do you see it as still a buy?
2021-05-27 16:41:47,wallstreetbets,I'm with you. I like where TELL is headed. Great work securing the 10 year supply contract today too.

2021-05-27 16:24:19,wallstreetbets,The chatter is that more big announcements like the one today are coming in June.  Buy the dips.
2021-05-27 16:27:21,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I do. They paid off their debt, announced major contracts, and the rumor is that there are a lot more to come. The new CEO they got in November grew a similar energy company from a 20b market cap to a 40b market cap over his time there. He has tons of experience and seems to know what he's doing.

Edit to add: the January/February pop was on no news, just speculation. Now there is a ton of good news that is leading to lots of institutional buying."

2021-05-27 16:50:54,wallstreetbets,Maybe I'll circle back on Monday. I try to stay out of fomo Fridays.
2021-05-27 18:15:15,wallstreetbets,"I am not the original poster, but I keep jumping on these threads to show support. I have been collecting since August 2020. So they have a few more contracts, and we should get some construction news as well. I really think this keeps climbing even before the next deal isannounced, a lot of meme stock hype had people distracted today. TELL investors are mainly institutions not FOMOing, so this announcement today will garner more interest. It should keep rising for the next five years as long as they continue to deliver and stay on track. I am holding 7.5k shares and have no plans to sell before $15 which I hope to see by Q2 of 2022, and that is a conservative estimate. Q1 2022 is the foretold date of FID at which point this should be a $15 dollar stock. I also have some calls, which I was going to be my set aside profits area, but the end of the rainbow price might be 50-80 in 5 years and that’s based on what Chenerie trades at as company. I am super bullish on this stock, and I am so glad other folks are catching on."
2021-05-27 16:53:58,wallstreetbets,"Solid decision. Letting it consolidate before jumping in is always a smart decision, too."

2021-05-27 16:34:28,wallstreetbets,Some of these comments are hilarious. Majority of people in this sub have been saying the same things since $5 🤦‍♂️. You’re either delusional or a bot. Train just started moving. Jump on while you can.
2021-05-27 19:35:08,wallstreetbets,"Dude.

I bought at 42 @ $10

Somehow I had forgot to cancel my limit sell at $12…..

….then the fucking stock goes to $29. 

I’m so pissed."
2021-05-27 16:31:23,wallstreetbets,"Just like last time its very risky. If your okay with losing your investment again, go head."
2021-05-27 16:35:58,wallstreetbets,Nope just Enjoy your fomo for being a puss 🤝
2021-05-27 16:08:07,wallstreetbets,"Ofcourse its still worth it GME and AMC is 2 stocks that is forbidden to sell !!! Dont sell your stocks man 
Get back in tomorrow and enjoy the ride"
2021-05-27 16:53:08,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell depressed."

2021-05-27 16:22:51,wallstreetbets,"I sold AMC at 6.6 after the first big dump cuz i listed to a friend.

I regret it deeply, would be worth 22k now instead of the 5k i sold it for"
2021-05-27 16:27:39,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Buy high, sell low. This is the way."
2021-05-27 16:41:26,wallstreetbets,Yes buy high sell low.

2021-05-27 18:39:15,wallstreetbets,"HECK YES!!!  Catch the short dip overnight.  Buy more in the morning.  BUY & HOLD!!!  Look what we did with GME over a month.  We are doing it again TOGETHER AS ONE, APES! 🚀🦍🚀💸🤑🚀"
2021-05-27 19:15:54,wallstreetbets,"There, there, my stupid ass brother did the same thing just recently.  Bought at $17 held until recently and sold at a lost, event though I told him to HOLD!  When I showed him the current price, he went silent."
2021-05-27 16:06:50,wallstreetbets,Why? Just why
2021-05-27 17:05:13,wallstreetbets,I did that too!  Paper handed bitch that I am.
2021-05-27 17:27:41,wallstreetbets,I sold today. I like GME’s chances better. Both are going up but IMO AMC has too many shares on the float. Idk I’m a fkn retard don’t listen to me.
2021-05-27 16:25:37,wallstreetbets,Wait. It’ll drop again when everyone sells. Pick up their baggage to keep the other primates safe.
2021-05-27 17:11:24,wallstreetbets,What does your wife’s boyfriend think?
2021-05-27 17:59:45,wallstreetbets,"Oh man, that was a very bad idea, but not to late to buy in this was all fomo and some short coverings, but not the meat of whats about to happen, it in a dip right now you would be wise to buy in first thing"
2021-05-27 18:36:57,wallstreetbets,Dumb ass!! Never sell for a loss! If your giving your money away just call me I’d be happy to collect it from you. I hope you learned your lesson 💎🙌
2021-05-27 16:08:57,wallstreetbets,You didn't lose enough last time ? Almost 700 million in volume today to get to its current price. No way it doesn't start dropping. Retail can't possibly keep this up very long
2021-05-27 16:21:13,wallstreetbets,Lol buying a $16 stock at $25 after. 7x volume surge? Sure why not.
2021-05-27 16:10:58,wallstreetbets,"In my uneducated opinion, looks like it'll dip the rest of the extended trading period. The candles are riding the bottom bollinger band on the 5m chart. Might be a buying opportunity...if you think it will go up again tomorrow. Here's to hoping it will 🍻"
2021-05-27 16:10:29,wallstreetbets,"I doubt it, there was over 600 mil in vol today. But why would you sell!?"
2021-05-27 16:09:40,wallstreetbets,F
2021-05-27 16:52:13,wallstreetbets,Some people never learn their mistakes. The cycle continues...
2021-05-27 16:26:54,wallstreetbets,"It's currently tanking in after market. Very risky buy imo but it could very well be a huge squeeze. The smart buy right now if SPCE. It has squeeze potential, they just had a successful test flight with several more flights coming up this summer which will all drive the price up on hype and if they go well. So many catalysts to drive this up, and it's had incredible support on its way up. My PT is $100 in a month and $200+ by end of summer if all flights go well."
2021-05-27 17:05:21,wallstreetbets,Make it all back
2021-05-27 17:17:04,wallstreetbets,Ahhhh... So you are the reason the stock took off. Nice. Usually I'm the catalyst for that sort of thing.
2021-05-27 17:21:16,wallstreetbets,Might be a bull trap discount tomorrow
2021-05-27 17:41:11,wallstreetbets,"Buy now for sure!!
You are right on time, then you can sell @10 again for a good old buy high sell low"
2021-05-27 17:52:08,wallstreetbets,"Yes! Buy high, sell low"
2021-05-27 18:22:43,wallstreetbets,Top
2021-05-27 19:44:51,wallstreetbets,You're supposed to buy low and sell high and not the other way around

2021-05-27 19:08:12,wallstreetbets,Could have gone to zero.
2021-05-27 19:44:13,wallstreetbets,this is the way.

2021-05-27 18:14:47,wallstreetbets,"Friendly advice since I see a few people posting who seem overwhelmed, take it or leave it. 

Imagine someone you care about (but who you think you're a bit smarter than) said out of nowhere ""omfg, I've got a 1200% gain...I'm up $20000 on this thing that's blowing up...I don't even know how to think about this...what do I even do? Should I sell...when do I sell...should I ever sell? wtf is happening...what should I do?""

Memes and bullshit aside, ask yourself what you'd tell them, or what you'd hope they'd tell you if the situation was reversed.

Be your own best friend."

Its hard, damn near impossible to keep buying dips when you have no money, hold on to dogs, sell stocks that are losers to keep piling coal into the furnace of the Titanic. I even had to stiff the Fed the 8k I owed Uncle Sam for taxes because I didn’t want to sell my losers......but the past two days are what make it all worth it!!!

I hope you apetards and your massive swinging dicks are all feeling as good as I am. I love you all of you faceless nameless stupid janitors, 17 year olds, truck drivers, crayon eaters and virgins ! 🐂 Gang for life!!!!"

2021-05-27 16:33:24,wallstreetbets,"I don't get it. Who's still holding/opening shorts on these meme plays?

I'd never ever short a stock but I do know the rules

1. Never join a crowded short.  If 1 large position cashes out it can burn you to the ground
2. If your short goes all MOMO/FOMO bail, go lick your wounds and live to fight another day

It's like they are sticking their heads in a financial woodchipper and hoping no-one turns it on

Congrats to all you Stock-Tards!  Can't have any sympathy for the poor fools (actually poor now) that are shorting this stuff. They 100% have this coming"

The least I could do was wish him a happy birthday. But I didn’t. I am a terrible son, I have gambling problems on the stock market and I cannot fathom with the moves I am making due to emotions. 

To date I have lost an Overwhelming amount due to greed. From days I am up 17k to just plain losing it all from greed. That’s no excuse to not celebrate my dad’s birthday.

Tomorrow, I am getting a cake, driving all the way to my parent’s place (1 and a half hour drive) and singing happy birthday to him as I walk in. Losing a substantial amount of my net worth and anger issues doesn’t give me the right to put it out on my family by ignoring them.

They are family. Happy Birthday Dad ❤️"

“Smart money” traders went to schools that taught to sell to lower the price. But degenerate apes are not respecting that principle. Stock goes up apes buy, stock goes down apes buy more. This unknown behavior is making them dig a bigger hole.

So retarded it's brilliant.  

This is why you Buy and Hold. 
Don't be shocked if they cause panic tomorrow.   They are dying for people to sell off their position with the June 2nd stock count starting.  If your stock isn't settled into your account by then, then you won't be counted for those shares. 

Today wasn't even  remotely a squeeze. Just Retail FOMO glomming  on.  Imagine a day with 1 billion in volume.  

Shorts lost over 800m just today on AMC, and are still doing it- which means they haven't even begun to cover.   

The next few weeks are huge, but the rules are simple.  
1. Buy
2. Hold 

Enjoy today's success! 
To many more 🥒

2021-05-27 18:18:04,wallstreetbets,"None. I’m ditching my CVX shares once they turn profit. As strong of a dividend as they have, I’m going to bank on greener energy companies for the future now that renewable energy is costing less."

2021-05-27 19:29:00,wallstreetbets,The idea that inflation is under control requires you to have your whole head in the sand. The Fed is just lying to everyone.

2021-05-27 16:12:37,wallstreetbets,Is that a insult? 1.5x my initial 10k on a joke stock is why I play the game.

2021-05-27 15:46:06,wallstreetbets,All in time friend. Let me take care of business with AMC first.
2021-05-27 19:50:54,wallstreetbets,Lets go 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
2021-05-27 15:44:13,wallstreetbets,Why PLTR
2021-05-27 15:52:03,wallstreetbets,Please switch to robinhood casino app idk what im looking at but it’s not pretty and hurts my eyes
2021-05-27 17:50:00,wallstreetbets,Ooof. I hope. But that will be best case scenario
2021-05-27 17:52:05,wallstreetbets,"While I don’t want to doubt you, I have zero belief that any AMC or GME holders will sell at a time it’s opportune and actually dump money into pltr or other growth stock.  It seems as if any squeeze will never be seen as THE squeeze and most will just stay in with hopes of an even bigger squeeze. Just quick two cents and not much thought behind it"
2021-05-27 15:47:06,wallstreetbets,Bc it’s a distraction. How does no one notice the instant flood of these bs posts all the sudden. Citadel hired more interns lol
2021-05-27 17:38:09,wallstreetbets,hope this is sarcasm
2021-05-27 18:18:04,wallstreetbets,Well have they/we been wrong yet? Did the squeeze happen and we didn’t know it?
2021-05-27 16:06:28,wallstreetbets,"You're an idiot. PLTR is an old meme that a lot of us have hundreds of thousands in. We've been constantly posting about it for months, the volume of PLTR posts right now is actually the lowest it's been in months.

Take your conspiracy theories elsewhere."
2021-05-27 15:52:06,wallstreetbets,Cringe
2021-05-27 18:10:26,wallstreetbets,Why the downvotes and salt? Lmao
2021-05-27 18:21:56,wallstreetbets,"You really think there will be a time when everyone is like “ok this was the squeeze, we good.” I don’t. There will always be people who think it didn’t really squeeze till each share is worth a new car.  Edit. I’m not saying they were wrong on the short interest or the play, but the general idea that a large group of holders are going to sell and invest in other stocks like pltr seems slim to none."
2021-05-27 18:16:49,wallstreetbets,Where were you when robinhood shut down trading for gme? Upped margins requirements over night and sold shares without orders.
2021-05-27 19:52:58,wallstreetbets,idk why you reply me? I Didn't downvote
2021-05-27 18:25:10,wallstreetbets,I’m certain we will know after the fact as we have in other short squeezes and we have not seen it yet.
2021-05-27 18:20:12,wallstreetbets,Saw the whole thing lmao. Idk if i should r/whoosh you because I’m not being serious and it seems obvious or if I just wasn’t obvious enough by calling it a casino app with pretty colors. I have schwab thats where my actual investments are jn terms of actually owning shares. I just gamble options on robinhood.
2021-05-27 18:25:32,wallstreetbets,Your sarcasm skills suck bro.
2021-05-27 18:27:41,wallstreetbets,I called it a casino app. Not my problem you jump to conclusions and take everything so damn serious 😂 jeeeeez
2021-05-27 15:34:32,wallstreetbets,"Hey whitey i got a nice discount today @ 1,700 @ 9.03 . We just need more volume 🚀🚀🚀👍👍 Whats your target???"

2021-05-27 16:19:23,wallstreetbets,"Holding 68,500 shares. It’s set up real nice."
2021-05-27 16:24:38,wallstreetbets,"I had 90% of my account in UWMC for a while. Just dumped the rest in, fuck it."

2021-05-27 15:53:23,wallstreetbets,Most of my options are at $20 soooo....
2021-05-27 16:28:24,wallstreetbets,"They may own 80% of my house, but I have 0.00001% of their company, so it basically cancels out."

One day though... one day"

PS: I googled it and have an idea now but dont know how to find that info on my beloved robinhood app"
2021-05-27 16:29:09,wallstreetbets,"Oh I know :p I meant if UWMC had 600 mill volume itd pop off much harder than 50%

Pipe dream I know, but if we gain enough organic ground maybe more will take notice"
2021-05-27 16:37:55,wallstreetbets,I approve of this strategy!

2021-05-27 15:33:31,wallstreetbets,I jumped into SPCE a couple of days ago! Now I’m thinking to take a dip on into BCRX & BYND. I read a quick article saying the both are being significantly shorted. Also BYND obtained a contract with KY🍗🐔. Any thoughts?
2021-05-27 16:13:32,wallstreetbets,BYND seems interesting. i’ll have to take a look.
2021-05-27 18:59:14,wallstreetbets,So I threw $100 in & well I’m up $4 lol
2021-05-27 16:11:29,wallstreetbets,Crazy they both have the same name of Redacted. Is that of Czech origin?
2021-05-27 15:25:00,wallstreetbets,Lol 2 people got caught trying to snitch on each other. Anyone wanna bet on who those 2 people are? This page has got me dying... can it be any more obvious that 2 people thought they were going to get fucked and the SEC knew nothing about them and they both snitched with claimant #1 being the first to offer information?

2021-05-27 19:07:41,wallstreetbets,"Bro damn.  Just saying it’s an unpopular stock even by institutions so if you think you’re buying the dip it could keep dipping.

2021-05-27 15:12:18,wallstreetbets,"I have leaps im holding for long term because, but I’ve been in the stock long enough to know that it’s coming back down short term so I sold for a 500% profit.

2021-05-27 15:35:51,wallstreetbets,Is SPCE a squeeze or do we just like the stonk? AMC is a little bit of a squeeze right now isn’t it? & of course we live the stonk
2021-05-27 19:43:33,wallstreetbets,"10/4, any idea when their next test flight will be?"
2021-05-27 18:53:42,wallstreetbets,"Seen an article talking about it being shorted it was in a top 20 chart of shorted stocks i read last week.

 Not saying it is a squeeze just saying what I've read on it recently. That chart by the way was to the end of April."

Fellow apes plzz watch this! Hedge funds are gonna intentionally make AMC hit $50 tomorrow in an attempt to try and get us to sell but don’t be fooled! It’s critical that we hold for lots of reasons that are layed out in the video. Plz watch!!"

2021-05-27 15:30:31,wallstreetbets,So it’s not too late for me? I just bought 300 shares💎🙌🥵👀 let’s do this
2021-05-27 16:23:21,wallstreetbets,Patience and you will be rewarded
2021-05-27 14:51:33,wallstreetbets,Let’s fucking goooo
2021-05-27 19:07:10,wallstreetbets,"Before you roast me, here me out fellow auts....  
Tomorrow will be big profit taking. The recent massive reverse repo may be the hedge funds last stand to try and blow up our rocket ship to the moon. One last cash land line to support a short push plus open short interest has only increased this week.  
THIS IS NOT THE SQUEEZE.  
No one has started covering their positions yet which means its a trap. My gut tells me institutions and funds will flush their shares soon....like Friday. In an attempt to ignite a sell off and use their media outlets to say the squeeze is over; aw shucks the WSB boys got us again! Do NOT fall for it.  
The squeeze hasn't started yet. This isn't the show or even us in the lobby waiting for the show. This is pure FOMO, price action, and small gamma daisy-chained squeezes. And sec under Gensler is restricting dark pools access and increasing mark to market timelines for the shorts.  
If we close above $26 on Friday that is 220k call options in the money - they will have to eat 22+ million shares. That is INSANE. Just. DON'T. SELL!"
2021-05-27 16:17:05,wallstreetbets,Pick me up by the legs on the way up. I bought the exact top today impulsively. Not selling.
2021-05-27 16:22:27,wallstreetbets,"Supposed to buy the dip! Good job though, mucho love"
2021-05-27 16:22:20,wallstreetbets,"Hopefully tomorrow goes well, otherwise mate, I’m sorry for your loss"
2021-05-27 16:43:47,wallstreetbets,I always see posts here of bagholders and wonder how. Then I see something like this and it all makes sense

2021-05-27 15:41:34,wallstreetbets,Remember what happened in after hours last time?

2021-05-27 15:47:19,wallstreetbets,"I'm usually against the ""HOLD"" crowd. But why would anyone sell at $50?

Wsb is 10million (vs 2 for the start of gme), we know the hedgies dirty tricks, the float is smaller, and we've done this before.

$50 is an entry point."
2021-05-27 17:05:00,wallstreetbets,"I just bought 45 more shares,I’m too broke, at 26.8"

2021-05-27 16:54:20,wallstreetbets,$100 is chump change not chimp change!
2021-05-27 15:27:22,wallstreetbets,"You meant 100k right? That’s what its going to be when the squeeze starts. Margin calls on shorts are in the near future.

2021-05-27 17:49:16,wallstreetbets,"I bought at $3 11 months ago and forgot about it until the GME thing happened. I bought it for longterm and hoped it would get to pre-covid numbers after the pandemic is over (which is what it's at right now). So I'm holding longterm anyway since that was the original plan, but I didn't think I'd reach my sell goal so soon, so yeah, I'm holding"
2021-05-27 15:40:10,wallstreetbets,You may well be right! But it is a lot of fun.
2021-05-27 18:04:15,wallstreetbets,Thank you
2021-05-27 18:02:24,wallstreetbets,"Bigger numbers are better,
thats why I buy stock at ATH"
2021-05-27 18:05:56,wallstreetbets,"HL didn't backstab me during the first wave of GME I trust them enough. Sometimes when Its really volatile they don't do quote and deal only fill/kill. But I've had no real issues with HL.
Though I wish they'd show a performance graph for total account balance."
2021-05-27 15:34:03,wallstreetbets,You clearly haven't been paying attention then.
2021-05-27 16:14:50,wallstreetbets,I'm not selling until it reaches 100k.
2021-05-27 17:54:59,wallstreetbets,U should probably read up on the dd and get familiar with the game plan

2021-05-27 16:38:06,wallstreetbets,"Let’s hope, because everyone around me is selling to take profits, ha, I’m staying till the moon, so I can do my dance with no gravity"
2021-05-27 19:07:04,wallstreetbets,"Pulled out of AMC with profit cuz I had a bad options position with the high IV and overpriced options since I bought late, I was at risk of losing too much, but I hope for y’all sake it keeps going up"

2021-05-27 18:03:32,wallstreetbets,This
2021-05-27 17:53:38,wallstreetbets,Honestly I missed the gme ordeal and bought for the same reason as you and then this community took me buy storm so I have been dedictIng 3 hours a day to it. Playing a shitbton of options and buying a ton of stock. Once this is over I will need to detox from this. Lol. The fomo is real and so is the anxiety. But it's worth it in the end. Let's go AMC. Also I will buy back in to support AMC and the CEO once the squeeze is completed. If this does the gme deal this could squeeze like a stress ball for months on end. Back and forth. Lol.
2021-05-27 15:38:37,wallstreetbets,"Not until today, hence the question...how far is it going to go?"
2021-05-27 18:05:38,wallstreetbets,Buy high sell low. You developed true autism
2021-05-27 15:40:30,wallstreetbets,"Ortex also triggered their short squeeze indicator for amc, which the do very rarely"
2021-05-27 15:37:25,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, thanks!"
2021-05-27 17:13:24,wallstreetbets,You can't. Short interest is only officially updated twice a month. Other sites can 'guess' like Ortex but aren't official.
2021-05-27 16:54:02,wallstreetbets,"Just got ride these dips, it's not as if they aren't expected. Anyone who shit the bed and got out because of a $2 drop isn't cut out for making big money."

2021-05-27 16:32:41,wallstreetbets,Great Scott Marty!!!
2021-05-27 16:19:07,wallstreetbets,Really shows how retarded someone is when they ask you to predict the future. If we knew that we’d all be rich

2021-05-27 19:58:37,wallstreetbets,"...And I'll tell you more.  Paper handing is literally cashing out way too early or panic selling a dip.  Selling shares and options for a 500+% gain is literally a great trade.  You just keep holding until the bubble bursts every time.  At least you can say you have diamond hands when your wife's bf kicks you out and mr paper hands here is rolling in his lambo... Which makes you, literally a retard."

2021-05-27 14:31:30,wallstreetbets,Difference being that Shopify is actually just slightly over price. Down to 1000 maybe more realistic. The growth is incredible and the ecosystem is solide.

2021-05-27 16:42:27,wallstreetbets,"I see those calls. I’m curious what your exit strategy is? Do you have enough cash to execute all of those, or are you trading them back? Do you think there will be enough volume of people trying to cover to trade them back?

I’m only asking because I have never taken such a huge position until relatively recently with NOK and I’m curious to hear others’ strategies."

2021-05-27 16:12:36,wallstreetbets,"I mean.....You simply jumped on the rocket and made quick and easy money when the rocket was already well under way.      If you have $1.5Mil to just chuck at something on a whim then this gain really doesn't mean shit to you.

2021-05-27 17:50:17,wallstreetbets,LOL I was saying “when” as in when the shorts start covering it’ll go a lot higher
2021-05-27 16:32:15,wallstreetbets,Oh ok so In essence when the market doesn’t have enough shares to supply the ask then they won’t show on the order sheet? Do I have that right?
2021-05-27 16:41:20,wallstreetbets,once  the price rockets up and we trip circuit breakers throughout the day we may be in the squeeze

2021-05-27 15:21:03,wallstreetbets,"Good question. I honestly didn’t consider owning Porsche Holdings stock instead but I think VW may be more liquid and more directly related to the auto group. Porsche Holdings is a bunch of Porsche and Piech family members holding onto their assets, one of which includes VW AG, which in turns owns 100% of Porsche brand."
2021-05-27 14:34:41,wallstreetbets,I think you misspelled Tesla
2021-05-27 18:27:37,wallstreetbets,VW seems to be the real tech powerhouse. Ford's small EVs will be based on VW's MEB platform.
2021-05-27 17:49:54,wallstreetbets,"My quick thoughts would be that they will be hurt in the short term with chip shortage and medium term with lack of competitive EVs. That said, they are a massive automaker that shouldn’t be written off. I think it’s a hold if you already have some, or buy at the next big dip."

2021-05-27 19:08:22,wallstreetbets,Maybe in 10-15 years but right now FORD is the only car company actually making cool EV’s and competing with Tesla.
2021-05-27 15:26:33,wallstreetbets,"VW AG holds all the EVs… Porsche Holdings would include VW AG and things like Porsche Design for laptops and pens and expensive shoes, and other assets like commercial real estate, retail, and things typical of family wealth management portfolios."

2021-05-27 19:21:04,wallstreetbets,Lol if you actually think the ID4 or Quattro are good EV’s or even competing on price and range. Also 2 of those cars are $100k+...
2021-05-27 16:42:58,wallstreetbets,"Yes thats why I have 7.5K on VW…

But no investment is safe. And this is WSB after all 😂"

2021-05-27 17:39:23,wallstreetbets,Break this down for me.  UWMC is valued around $10-14/shr.  But if a Gamma happens it could hit triple digits like GME?  Me dumb ape say thanks.
2021-05-27 16:42:06,wallstreetbets,"Difference between GME, AMC and other “meme” stocks, and UWMC, UWMC is a viable company with what its trading for and then some, with a bright outlook long term, and a moon shot is a very realistic thought. Short percentage wise, UWMC should moon before AMC and GME, if those 2 even moon"

2021-05-27 19:08:18,wallstreetbets,We must’ve boarded together.
2021-05-27 15:30:19,wallstreetbets,$9 hit and its not dropping!
2021-05-27 13:46:14,wallstreetbets,What are those targets? I have 500 shares and a bunch of Summer calls
2021-05-27 18:58:29,wallstreetbets,Only have $200.00 worth of calls. Might have to ask my wife’s bf if I can unwind some positions tomorrow.
2021-05-27 17:00:57,wallstreetbets,I cant give you financial advice I will just say I will hold it till it gets to 20.
2021-05-27 14:39:12,wallstreetbets,It makes sense as a way to preserve some of your amc/gme gains.
2021-05-27 14:33:58,wallstreetbets,"Yep, it's the next in line"
2021-05-27 16:39:52,wallstreetbets,"Probably smarter to YOLO into something that has not just peaked, just my 2 cents"
2021-05-27 16:24:04,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't be surprised if this has AT LEAST the gains that AMC has...
2021-05-27 14:19:13,wallstreetbets,"For me personally, because UWMC actually makes money year over year. AMC definitely has the momentum and top-notch meme-ability right now, but UWMC should be more stable for the long term. Plus divvies. Yeah yeah, I sound like a boomer..."
2021-05-27 14:36:35,wallstreetbets,"Amc has had a great run, hope it keeps going some more. Uwmc run has just started"
2021-05-27 13:39:39,wallstreetbets,"i wish i could buy more AMC but i also invested some money in GME, CTRM and HRPK"
2021-05-27 13:42:58,wallstreetbets,Why not let the guy decide what he invests in?
2021-05-27 14:03:57,wallstreetbets,Best part is it ain't even a gamble when you get 5% divitendies anyway
2021-05-27 13:52:22,wallstreetbets,Deutsche Bank has a $12 target. Goldman and CS are at $10.50.
2021-05-27 13:51:30,wallstreetbets,"UWMC has targets from $10 all the way to $14. Many were made before the earnings and buybacks, so I think we have a lot of room to run to the high end. 

A squeeze could 3x from here though."
2021-05-27 19:04:02,wallstreetbets,"Ya, uwmc is just starting its run, nice chance to get in early"
2021-05-27 13:44:23,wallstreetbets,That’s true no problem 😃
2021-05-27 13:55:10,wallstreetbets,"To clarify for a dumb ape like me, you're saying UWMC might squeeze once it hits 10-14, right? Or are you saying those values would be the peak if there's a squeeze"
2021-05-27 14:22:28,wallstreetbets,"The stock is worth $10-14 *regardless* of a squeeze. If no squeeze, this is still a stock worth $10-14 according to investor publications. 

We don’t know when exactly a squeeze will happen (if it does), but the pieces are in play. High short interest, hard to borrow shares, high short borrow fee. 

If a squeeze does happen, this goes parabolic and can easily do three times its current share price. So maybe $24-27. Could be more. Could be less. But squeezes are big violent moves."
2021-05-27 14:08:59,wallstreetbets,"The price should go to around $12, once it gets there, the squeeze/FOMO happens and pushes the stock to $20-30. If it follows the same pattern as RKT, it then quickly falls back to sub $10.

Edit: I'm also dumb but taking a SWAG here."
2021-05-27 13:59:30,wallstreetbets,Also dumb and need clarification
2021-05-27 15:04:19,wallstreetbets,I just got a boner that caused me to grab a filthy handle of $10 mid-June contracts.  So cheap right now.
2021-05-27 16:17:44,wallstreetbets,"I gotta think closing over $9 today was huge. Now that it cleared that, it should move smartly to the $12 price target and then boom! we're riding that parabola."
2021-05-27 15:00:33,wallstreetbets,Thanks for that.
2021-05-27 18:45:26,wallstreetbets,Same condition with 9 June 21
2021-05-27 15:17:36,wallstreetbets,Excellent DD 👍

2021-05-27 15:27:22,wallstreetbets,"Great DD

Just sold all my CHPT at a profit today and put in in AMC. Will get back in to CHPT when I have even more money."
2021-05-27 14:46:41,wallstreetbets,"I dont see a ton of their chargers here in the Portland area. It seems to be mostly dominated between Blink and Volta.

You're right in the regard and while Volta $VLTA (still waiting on IPO) is nice because it offers free L2 charging, it is easily repeated. 

I wouldn't discount Blink though. Its a unique partnership that they form with businesses that get a small cut of the charging revenues."
2021-05-27 15:26:40,wallstreetbets,Was also looking at charge point thanks for the DD.
2021-05-27 14:17:32,wallstreetbets,When was there ipo
2021-05-27 14:52:09,wallstreetbets,It became public through the spac Switchback Energy Acquisition Corporation(SBE)

2021-05-27 14:41:36,wallstreetbets,Daiyum your $5415 loss made AMC soar in millions of profits for us?  I'm too stupid to understand how that is calculated.
2021-05-27 15:12:48,wallstreetbets,Die bear
2021-05-27 13:46:40,wallstreetbets,"People who ask for money when posting losses are the same assholes who rub it in your face when they somehow get it right.. get fucked OP, go back to giving hand jobs behind the local Wendy’s..

#2  you bought puts. That means you're shorting the stock. The losses are your own."

2021-05-27 14:33:45,wallstreetbets,I love reading downvoted comments. I don't know why.
2021-05-27 16:33:47,wallstreetbets,"I had paper hands and sold AMC towards the start of the year, then went back in and held. Learnt my lesson, but damn, if I had stayed the course my gains would have been sitting pretty. 🤦🏽‍♂️

Harsh lesson learnt. 😂"
2021-05-27 14:27:54,wallstreetbets,Ouch. Your wife’s boyfriend won’t be happy when you have to tell him this week that you can’t pay next month’s rent.

2021-05-27 13:35:51,wallstreetbets,"Noice.

Even though I bought puts that expire in July, they went UP in value because of the volume today, I actually saw all my puts increase in value too.  Not like my Calls, my Calls went up 400%, the long haul puts about 8%."
2021-05-27 16:41:24,wallstreetbets,Shame I had sold my AMC for GME awhile ago. Was shocked when I was monitoring GME today that AMC was at $30. I couldn't believe it xD

2021-05-27 18:45:33,wallstreetbets,So did this retard bet the stock would go down
2021-05-27 18:46:02,wallstreetbets,How the fuck does one lose on AMC?

2021-05-27 18:58:30,wallstreetbets,used my 100 shares as collateral and sold a $14 call when amc was at 10... -970% but its okay cause i get to keep the $40 premium lol
2021-05-27 19:07:01,wallstreetbets,I like puts but not once it's on tv. That's one one the best/easiest clues you'll ever get
2021-05-27 19:08:15,wallstreetbets,I was mad about the $200 I lost. Good lawd I’ll be quiet about my coins.
2021-05-27 19:09:21,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service kind internet retard

2021-05-27 19:17:27,wallstreetbets,It rose because I sold at 12.
2021-05-27 19:24:44,wallstreetbets,I hope this was hedging your shares...
2021-05-27 19:27:15,wallstreetbets,We don't sell shit
2021-05-27 19:29:38,wallstreetbets,You bet against a community that you are now asking to cover your losses? 😂
2021-05-27 19:29:41,wallstreetbets,No no... It was me that sent the price soaring. Right after I sold at 15.00. I can use my gains (because I did make a gain) to buy some new boots. Mine are all worn out because I keep kicking myself for selling.
2021-05-27 19:31:36,wallstreetbets,"Well, you still have tomorrow!"

2021-05-27 14:48:57,wallstreetbets,You think AMCs fair market value is $30 a share?
2021-05-27 15:02:57,wallstreetbets,Short rocket mortgage
2021-05-27 17:35:16,wallstreetbets,Wish there was a extend expiration time option
2021-05-27 17:52:05,wallstreetbets,"To be fair who thought GameStop would be staying as high as it is, could be looking at the same situation here. There will be a bottom, is it $15? I don’t know."
2021-05-27 19:12:21,wallstreetbets,"Especially with streaming giants like
Hbomax Amazon and Netflix"
2021-05-27 17:19:57,wallstreetbets,Some of you idiots take things so seriously. you need to relax man.
2021-05-27 14:48:03,wallstreetbets,"While I understand this guy deserves no consolation for betting against the majority of the AMC bulls and bag holders, that's a bit much.  GTFO woulda sufficed."
2021-05-27 14:39:56,wallstreetbets,Why are you so bitter today?
2021-05-27 17:49:12,wallstreetbets,Why all the hate?
2021-05-27 13:41:13,wallstreetbets,"I’m no expert, but $26 amc in a week? It’s next to hitting the lottery"

2021-05-27 17:51:38,wallstreetbets,I look at charts to get off
2021-05-27 19:50:37,wallstreetbets,Same. Losing almost half my portfolio over the last three months after going 5k to 25k has me weak handedly taking profits all over the place
2021-05-27 18:49:47,wallstreetbets,"Off to get charts, I look."
2021-05-27 19:41:02,wallstreetbets,Sell mean buy

2021-05-27 19:38:56,wallstreetbets,"You see, when a buyer and a seller are in love with each other..."
2021-05-27 19:21:39,wallstreetbets,Sell? Get rid of your stocks is the simplest way of explaining it lol

2021-05-27 14:46:05,wallstreetbets,"I believe you.  

Please start posting your trades beforehand though - so I can do the opposite."
2021-05-27 17:39:10,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, just stop lol. I mean I know you mean well but bragging about losing is not bragging. I do hope your future endeavors don't continue to be detrimental to your pockets."
2021-05-27 14:20:49,wallstreetbets,Lmao in your dreams buddy
2021-05-27 19:10:54,wallstreetbets,Imagine having -100 comment karma

2021-05-27 17:43:50,wallstreetbets,DM me
2021-05-27 13:41:51,wallstreetbets,"No sir this is WSB, 🌈🐻 like you get no lube up the dookie chute."

2021-05-27 14:15:00,wallstreetbets,You're welcome
2021-05-27 13:39:48,wallstreetbets,It's alright. I just bought a 26c at 25.80 for the lols. You'll see $21 by the end of the day.  👍
2021-05-27 18:24:19,wallstreetbets,"I bought in a $3 11 months ago for the longterm, but didn't think I'd reach my sell goal this early. I was prepared to hold for up to 5 years. Thanks for the boost!"

2021-05-27 18:27:28,wallstreetbets,Ok mom lol
2021-05-27 17:23:09,wallstreetbets,No it was not because you bet with us. It’s because you paper handed when you saw your account down by half.
2021-05-27 13:52:17,wallstreetbets,"Ok Kenny 
9 posts and all short positions 
Thanks for giving us your money"
2021-05-27 17:05:02,wallstreetbets,It’s like playing roulette. You were betting on calls (black) and it wasn’t hitting your down so big so you change it up to puts (red) with the last of your money and black finally hits. Haha you never switch you gotta ride that shit lol
2021-05-27 17:30:34,wallstreetbets,This is the smartest comment you've made yet.
2021-05-27 15:22:18,wallstreetbets,"I meant to buy them for July, but apparently I cant read so, such is life"
2021-05-27 15:09:18,wallstreetbets,"Of course not... no one who owns AMC or GME right now thinks it’s fair market value. It’s about the potential it has due to shorts, as well as demand"
2021-05-27 15:36:52,wallstreetbets,I dunno how to short it can u teach me ?
2021-05-27 19:14:27,wallstreetbets,Amazon bid on MGM so should be sweet for Prime in the long run! Hope Netflix and Amzn step it up with the quality content though. At least were getting seinfeld sometime this year on the Nflix
2021-05-27 17:22:32,wallstreetbets,Nah man. You would of happily accepted people’s money if offered just to make a bad bet again. You can eat my ass.
2021-05-27 15:07:07,wallstreetbets,"Not just AMC APES, About 600k EMPLOYEES as well. F this dude and anyone defending him..."
2021-05-27 14:41:13,wallstreetbets,"You sided with the class enemy, you deserve all the losses they get"
2021-05-27 13:41:40,wallstreetbets,Right? I know. I know.

2021-05-27 17:44:02,wallstreetbets,Because it literally breaks the rules
2021-05-27 15:02:31,wallstreetbets,Right
2021-05-27 18:40:56,wallstreetbets,This is a casino....
2021-05-27 13:42:31,wallstreetbets,Wsb is the reason I’m down 40K on my other meme stocks lol
2021-05-27 14:40:00,wallstreetbets,"Shit I'd fuck myself with a banana for 6k, lol"
2021-05-27 16:25:31,wallstreetbets,"I got a real life laugh out of this, thanks buddy"
2021-05-27 17:25:12,wallstreetbets,"I cant paper hand options, they expire eventually lol."
2021-05-27 17:05:32,wallstreetbets,We’ll use it better than him clearly
2021-05-27 16:32:56,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-27 17:23:39,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty sure if people sent you money you’d accept it to so stop wasting your time and emotions here. I’m down 8K this week but you’re acting like a bigger bitch than me with your long paragraph
2021-05-27 15:25:33,wallstreetbets,"Hey I'm an AMC holder too since January so I get it, and I don't feel bad for him at all.  Our victory is coming soon so it's just a waste of energy and negative vibes to get upset.  We're gonna be on the moon soon, just wave and laugh at him!"
2021-05-27 16:03:17,wallstreetbets,"He bought puts, he didn't short...you can bet on the stock price moving up and down without people losing jobs. Don't extrapolate Shitadel trying to drive GameStop into the ground with normal trading activity.

By your logic, if AMC DOES rocket, that could be a threat to their competition. So if you buy calls, you're basically saying you want Regal Cinemas employees to lose their jobs, right??

We're all just trying to make money here (well, some of us are, anyways)...let's not pretend we're morally superior to those who disagree with our short term price predictions."
2021-05-27 19:16:16,wallstreetbets,Sure
2021-05-27 15:03:35,wallstreetbets,Thank god
2021-05-27 14:42:46,wallstreetbets,I thought this sub was full of retards...

2021-05-27 18:21:01,wallstreetbets,The charts get off from looking at me
2021-05-27 19:18:16,wallstreetbets,I hold my phone up in the mirror as I look at my own ass to get off!!!!
2021-05-27 16:07:47,wallstreetbets,Your comments are as stupid as your investments
2021-05-27 18:57:39,wallstreetbets,I don’t think you know what shorting is
2021-05-27 15:04:24,wallstreetbets,Lmao stfu you are begging for money from poor people.
2021-05-27 17:31:15,wallstreetbets,I'm gonna go out a limb and say that this was your whole portfolio or close to it? 🤣
2021-05-27 13:43:31,wallstreetbets,It’s ok Kenny we will give you a job when you lose your shit
2021-05-27 15:44:19,wallstreetbets,"r/wsb does not give financial advice. 

That's entirely your fault."
2021-05-27 16:08:53,wallstreetbets,"No the reason you're down 40k is because you're retarded. Own up to it. ""Not financial advice, this is a casino"" is all over these boards."

**Myovant and Pfizer's uterine fibroids med scores FDA nod, setting up showdown with AbbVie**

**by Noah Higgins-Dunn | May 26, 2021 5:31pm**

The FDA approved Myovant's relugolix, marketed as Myfembree, to help women manage heavy menstrual bleeding linked to uterine fibroids. (Myovant Sciences)

Fresh off the back of Myovant Sciences’ first FDA win for relugolix in prostate cancer late last year, the Swiss pharma can now add a second indication to its flagship drug's resume.

The U.S. FDA on Wednesday approved Myovant’s relugolix in combination with two hormone drugs as the first once-daily treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding linked to uterine fibroids in premenopausal women, with a treatment duration for up to two years. The drug will be marketed as Myfembree.

Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that develop in the uterus. They're among the most common reproductive tract tumors in women, Myovant says, and can cause serious symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, abdominal bloating and, in some cases, infertility.

They can be treated with birth control to address bleeding and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, which can shrink fibroids. Patients with more severe symptoms may need surgery.

Millions of women in the U.S. are affected by uterine fibroids, which account for over 250,000 hysterectomies each year, Myovant CEO Dave Marek said.

Myovant predicts roughly 19 million women in the U.S. have uterine fibroids, although only a quarter of those women, or about 5 million, will experience symptoms and seek care from a physician, Marek said. About 3 million will fail on first-line treatments, he added. The company's immediate goal will be to target those patients.

""We are going to need to do education to get (women) to know that there are options for them and that what they're having is not normal, and that there's something to do about it,"" Myovant Chief Medical Officer Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira said in an interview.

RELATED: Myovant leans on new partner Pfizer as it dives into first launch for cancer drug Orgovyx

Wednesday's approval marks the second FDA nod for Myovant in less than a year after relugolix scored a go-ahead in prostate cancer in December, sold as Orgovyx. The company is also testing its flagship drug in women with endometriosis, another painful disorder involving the uterus’s tissue, and as a pregnancy prevention medication.

Pfizer will help Myovant sell Myfembree for uterine fibroid patients in the U.S. as early as June. The pharma giant doled out $650 million upfront plus sweeteners last year to get a piece of the drug, which launched in prostate cancer patients in early 2021.

""We are shifting from a development stage company to a commercial stage company,"" Marek told Fierce Pharma. ""A key part of that was finding a partner in Pfizer that has tremendous strength, not only in prostate cancer but also in women's health.""

But Myfembree will have to battle against AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences’ already standing Oriahnn (elagolix) for a slice of the uterine fibroid market.

After receiving the FDA’s clearance to help treat heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids nearly a year ago, AbbVie's med has a sizable head start. Oriahnn, which is approved for both uterine fibroids and endometriosis, raked in $121 million in U.S. sales for the Illinois pharma in 2020.

For Myovant's part, it has not provided any forecasts into potential revenues, Marek said. However, Myovant believes physicians will favor the convenience of its once-daily pill versus the twice-daily pill from AbbVie.

A bottle of 28 Myfembree tablets will cost about $975 before rebates, according to an SEC filing.

RELATED: Myovant's uterine fibroid med hits the mark in 2nd phase 3 trial

The FDA based its Myfembree approval on two replicate phase 3 trials—dubbed LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2—that showed the med significantly beat placebo in preventing blood loss among women with uterine fibroids. Specifically, 72.1% and 71.2% of women in the relugolix arm responded to the treatment compared with 16.8% and 14.7% of women in the placebo groups after 24 weeks, respectively.

In its approval, the FDA warned the drug shouldn’t be used for longer than 24 months due to risk of continued bone loss that may not be reversible.

2021-05-27 15:31:47,wallstreetbets,"Ford should do good, as they have orders from freight companies for the truck. I have 100 contract as well make $10k today."
2021-05-27 12:44:48,wallstreetbets,Ford for the win! Let’s go!!!
2021-05-27 14:18:44,wallstreetbets,"Was looking into some 18c Jan 2022, thoughts?"
2021-05-27 14:49:59,wallstreetbets,U we’re just early to the party ...huge win.... micheal burry style!
2021-05-27 12:51:56,wallstreetbets,"They have big plans for EV going forward. They are going to pick Tesla for sure. I can’t say they will catch or do better but a little competitive spirit between them is good for both I think.
Edit: I also hold 2000 shares in my IRA but I bought them well after these at about 11.50"
2021-05-27 12:58:14,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree obviously. And also, it’s not ridiculously overvalued. Up until a few days ago really it was at a PE of about 10. I know you really can’t compare Ford to Tesla but I’m just saying the valuation has so much room to go up now that they are moving into the EV space."
2021-05-27 12:46:08,wallstreetbets,Finally. I thought I missed my chance to sell these back in late March but held them anyway.
2021-05-27 15:36:46,wallstreetbets,I can certainly see it going there by 2022 I will say that. I guess we will see
2021-05-27 13:00:07,wallstreetbets,You can’t really compare Tesla and Ford though. Ford is a car company. Tesla is… … . … well. Tesla lol
2021-05-27 13:01:25,wallstreetbets,Yea I totally get that. I’m not comparing the companies in that way just saying I feel Ford is undervalued in a big way.
2021-05-27 13:03:26,wallstreetbets,Oh for sure. Way Undervalued. I’m glad I got a few hundred shares when they were under 10$ 😂.
2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Happy to see everyone make it all back on GME and AMC... Anyone still holding BB like a retard? Makes me wonder why didn’t I yolo into those two and instead to of BB 
2021-05-27 11:54:19,wallstreetbets,I am still holding BB w $20 average. Help me
2021-05-27 11:58:14,wallstreetbets,BB HOLDING STRONG!
2021-05-27 11:47:23,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I'm like a retard on BB duh!!"
2021-05-27 15:09:33,wallstreetbets,"I worked at BlackBerry for six years - from it's very highs to it's very lows.

My new life goal is to make more money trading BlackBerry than I made in the six years I worked there."
2021-05-27 12:05:05,wallstreetbets,Holding BB and AMC with the grip of a true ape
2021-05-27 11:48:25,wallstreetbets,I bought bb today

2021-05-27 12:14:36,wallstreetbets,I’m in at 20...
2021-05-27 11:53:53,wallstreetbets,"BB still has a lot of potential,  just hope people realize before your calls expire 🤣"
2021-05-27 11:47:54,wallstreetbets,"I think I got some still.  Waiting for that turn..... 

💎 ✊"
2021-05-27 13:32:49,wallstreetbets,Got in on bb at $18......
2021-05-27 11:53:23,wallstreetbets,BB will have its time sooner or later! Just bought myself 7 and then 13 more = 20 contracts @ 10. We will hit the moon just like GME and AMC mate.
2021-05-27 14:59:33,wallstreetbets,BB going past 10.00 right now.... feelsgoodman.
2021-05-27 12:36:58,wallstreetbets,"I’m long on bb. Long as fuck dude. 50 contracts for 2023 atm and itm. 400 shares. 111 fds too. 
Bb is a deeeeeeeeep value play. If ivy prints cool- if patent sale prints cool- if it gets a heads up valuation like it’s peers, I’ll be itm across the board. 
Tldr- bb Long mün"
2021-05-27 11:51:44,wallstreetbets,"I love BB, I'm hoping berry picking season coming soon!"
2021-05-27 12:32:15,wallstreetbets,One more BB retard here ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)
2021-05-27 13:50:04,wallstreetbets,"I have been eating a lot of blackberries lately for breakfast, not because of the health benefits regarding high vitamin C, K, maganese, and fiber  but because I’m very rudimentary and I have been HODLing BB at 25 per share. My hopes to eating blackberries often is that it reminds me that sticking to my HODL will be met with great moon views with my fellow smooth brained apes one day. 

Bless you apes. I love you all in a very retarded way."
2021-05-27 13:25:27,wallstreetbets,Bb will have its day
2021-05-27 15:15:15,wallstreetbets,BB TO THE MOON SAVE ME AT $20
2021-05-27 13:35:35,wallstreetbets,"BB will be next. These things come in waves. Ride one up, move on to the next one. I've already put gains from AMC into BB calls."
2021-05-27 13:39:18,wallstreetbets,I'm still holding BB lol
2021-05-27 13:51:28,wallstreetbets,It's berry season 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

2021-05-27 12:27:29,wallstreetbets,Holding strong on BB!
2021-05-27 15:12:00,wallstreetbets,I'm in BB. Think of putting more of my hard earned money into the stock. Is anyone adding here??
2021-05-27 15:44:36,wallstreetbets,I am holding BB also and buying.

2021-05-27 12:47:56,wallstreetbets,Me hahaha
2021-05-27 13:27:36,wallstreetbets,"Look at the on balance volume for bb YTD it is in the exact same position in as amc gme, vast majority of bb holders never sold, I hold 1 share of bb and xx of GMe so I'm not really in bb, but I think ye are in the same position"
2021-05-27 12:00:40,wallstreetbets,"Because they said bb actually a good company,  not a meme stock🤣"
2021-05-27 12:42:03,wallstreetbets,Soon
2021-05-27 13:34:08,wallstreetbets,BB in due time.. one at a time
2021-05-27 13:45:07,wallstreetbets,Green day. Nice
2021-05-27 16:41:39,wallstreetbets,My thesis is that BB will cycle in next run and be the front of it. Current trend GME 🚀-> AMC-> 🚀-> BB 🚀
2021-05-27 11:48:01,wallstreetbets,Am still holding we are doing better than gme but seem all attention is on amc today but if we can get bb to 15 by tomorrow that be great lmao
2021-05-27 15:04:20,wallstreetbets,I caught the BB knife early on but I still believe in the fundamentals of the company. I can easily see $20 before EOY.
2021-05-27 16:29:16,wallstreetbets,Still holding @ around 9.81 and no money left between GME and BB to invest lol
2021-05-27 16:32:05,wallstreetbets,Gotta diversify your YOLO’s bro
2021-05-27 16:38:32,wallstreetbets,183 @ $17. No money to average down :/
2021-05-27 17:03:13,wallstreetbets,Holding BB. In red since January. Not selling until it hits 50 or more.  It’s up 10.30 AH 🚀
2021-05-27 13:34:50,wallstreetbets,Nokia too!  BB and NOK were part of the meme stocks and everyone ditched them.  AMC just recently picked up popularity steam again so I hope the same happens for these two.
2021-05-27 13:49:40,wallstreetbets,BB is a moon shot compared to those two has beens. The tape action is off the charts......a triple by June 30.
2021-05-27 13:40:06,wallstreetbets,Holding bb and need your help :) gotta hit 40 and sell lol
2021-05-27 13:45:50,wallstreetbets,sTILL HOLDING bb
2021-05-27 14:23:54,wallstreetbets,BB holding. Do you think BB go up?
2021-05-27 14:31:42,wallstreetbets,"319 @ $16.63, was hoping to throw my profits from whenever a certain nameless canine money reached a certain price so I could average BB the hell down. But alas, that's not happening as of yet."
2021-05-27 14:45:21,wallstreetbets,Bought @15.5... HELP!!! I just want my money back!!!

2021-05-27 15:22:53,wallstreetbets,I've been holding BB since $6 (BB.TO). I felt like I missed the boat for the longest time when it sank from $30+ but I'm just on for the ride now. Still holding GME tho. To the 🌙
2021-05-27 15:31:08,wallstreetbets,"Bought my first BB @10.73 in Jan. Missed the moon and sold later @14 and 10.9 for small gains in Feb. 

Coming back with as much retard and as little brain cells with a 2% share of my portfolio ready to double, triple and quadruple down until we bring this gem to a moon full of blackberries 🫐

2021-05-27 16:33:00,wallstreetbets,"For what it's worth, put the last of my money into BB to go long just before close, choosing it over NVDA, BYND, and BA."
2021-05-27 14:40:06,wallstreetbets,BB IS VERY STRONK COMPANY THE MOMENT YOU SELL THE MOMENT IT WILL MOON FORE SURE WERE ALL HOLDING BRUH
2021-05-27 15:15:52,wallstreetbets,"I believe BB is a very solid investment, likely to have large gains this year. I like the stock."
2021-05-27 11:47:56,wallstreetbets,I sold bb a long time ago and bought more amc in March of February...

2021-05-27 15:52:53,wallstreetbets,AMC and BB
2021-05-27 15:57:18,wallstreetbets,Holding BB. Its a long term one. Given the advancements in ev cars and software its just a matter of time.
2021-05-27 15:57:40,wallstreetbets,I'm long on BB. I like the stock. I buy more whenever it's low.
2021-05-27 16:00:48,wallstreetbets,Yup 20k shares @ 10.15
2021-05-27 16:04:00,wallstreetbets,"BB in comparison to AMC & GME is a great stock but for some reason doesn't get the same attention.

I am hoping as time progresses the stock will go up purely due to inflation.

Riper the berry sweeter the juice."
2021-05-27 16:07:43,wallstreetbets,I did the same. I choose bb over gme and AMC. Holding 46 down over 43%. Im good at this.
2021-05-27 17:07:36,wallstreetbets,Just went long BB $10 Jun-18 call...up 5%. Ready for loss porn!
2021-05-27 11:46:52,wallstreetbets,"AMC is the only one that “made it all back”, and people are just going to keep holding and fall into the same exact thing again"
2021-05-27 11:51:53,wallstreetbets,It’s not AMC or GME ...so I don’t get it?
2021-05-27 12:13:21,wallstreetbets,I'm still on BB like an idiot... Basically lost so much on it that it's not worth selling at this point...

2021-05-27 15:56:04,wallstreetbets,Bought at 20. Holding until 40. Don't even care to know where it's at until then. BB is the ugly Chad duckling amongst virgin hot ducks. It's swan day is coming! 🦢
2021-05-27 15:59:50,wallstreetbets,Hold you retarded apes this is just the beginning AMC to 1000k an beyond apes strong together you will regret selling that is facts

2021-05-27 16:18:51,wallstreetbets,I’m still getting ReKT if you guys can come back for me soon
2021-05-27 16:18:53,wallstreetbets,"I think BB got washed up in the whole short squeeze mania but in reality it has strong long term potential. Look into QNX and BB's recent partnership with Baidu. BB will have it's place on the moon in time. 

Full disclosure: not holding any right now but I certainly plan on buying some after GME moon 🚀

*Not financial advice"
2021-05-27 16:22:27,wallstreetbets,"Sell it and put it in AMC, new highs today, and Lee pushing it up, make them sell their shorts for losses"

2021-05-27 16:35:09,wallstreetbets,Man it feels like January again. I love it. Let’s get fucking rich again.
2021-05-27 16:39:37,wallstreetbets,I'm still holding. Bought in at $10. The stock may have some long term potential. It wasn't heavily shorted like the other two
2021-05-27 16:41:11,wallstreetbets,Feel like an idiot too don’t worry. I didn’t lose money but I threw all my money in calls for other things then I sold covered calls on ONLY AMC with a $12 share price for $16 calls
2021-05-27 16:42:11,wallstreetbets,"Yup, holding 200 @ 18.5 like a retard. Considering buying more now that GME is on round 3."

2021-05-27 18:23:41,wallstreetbets,sold my bb shares took what i had left and invested in amc. made it all back and some this week.

2021-05-27 18:51:34,wallstreetbets,I'd average that call down before the price pops.
2021-05-27 18:53:36,wallstreetbets,And NOK ????? Go to the moon with NOK 💪🏼🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-27 18:56:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes - today bb went from 9.4 to 9.51...

2021-05-27 19:14:41,wallstreetbets,Haha fucked around and bought two calls because they’re dirt cheap. Hopefully I can use it to buy more amc but the way things look I should have used it for amc. Thankfully it wasn’t much
2021-05-27 19:16:11,wallstreetbets,60 shares at 9.00 fam
2021-05-27 19:19:39,wallstreetbets,This guy
2021-05-27 19:21:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’ve been holding for sooooo long. my AMC took off today, BB next"

2021-05-27 19:48:42,wallstreetbets,bb is about to explode too. Dont worry
2021-05-27 19:52:50,wallstreetbets,BB? Whhhyyyyy? I feel like I should buy some shares just to help all of you out
2021-05-27 19:53:17,wallstreetbets,Hold on BB brothers!! We're coming with a new rocket ship just for us! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-27 19:56:35,wallstreetbets,I bought both GME and BB. I figured BB might have the same attention and some short interest like GME but actually has good tech that will be useful in the future. Closed out my GME position at $350 and ended up dumping all profits right into a black hole otherwise referred to as BB. Many months later I'm refusing to sell at a loss. I have until 2023 so I guess I'm going for long term tax bracket....
2021-05-27 11:50:10,wallstreetbets,Dam got suckered into a technology company that dies a decade ago... you got swindled my man.
2021-05-27 18:51:25,wallstreetbets,Genuinely curious why you bought this trash in the first place when it wasn’t even shorted? Makes no sense lmao
2021-05-27 12:41:39,wallstreetbets,It’s not too late to switch

2021-05-27 15:07:17,wallstreetbets,"jesus.  
I bought BB at the top and felt bad. Like the peak."
2021-05-27 15:15:18,wallstreetbets,Because you are an idiot??
2021-05-27 15:33:40,wallstreetbets,"BB always was a little sketch. Like some others have said, it'll probably have it's time. I wonder if this crazy retail trader unification will become cyclic. When one moons, on the the next."
2021-05-27 15:52:53,wallstreetbets,"All my BB puts expired 😟

I wasn't wrong. I was just early. BB will go into the basement eventually."
2021-05-27 19:03:02,wallstreetbets,The DD on BB was always shit.
2021-05-27 17:01:56,wallstreetbets,BB @17.99 you’re not alone 🙃
2021-05-27 13:39:18,wallstreetbets,"I’m too scared to realize the loss so I’m keeping it in BB until it goes back up to $18-19. If it doesn’t go back up to price within the year, that’s probably my sign to quit this bullshit."

2021-05-27 15:06:39,wallstreetbets,"Same, just bought a few more to bring my avg down!"

2021-05-27 17:58:50,wallstreetbets,Lmao bro I was their I sold like a bitch at a loss but it’s cool . GME got that money when it was at 40
2021-05-27 18:28:39,wallstreetbets,Hey that's me!
2021-05-27 19:32:25,wallstreetbets,$16 average.  But AMC/GME have more than made up for any BB-pain.
2021-05-27 19:38:17,wallstreetbets,Thank you. My average is USD6.16
2021-05-27 19:48:55,wallstreetbets,I’m at $22.30.  FML.
2021-05-27 18:34:04,wallstreetbets,"Yesterday for me.  My first real stock, if you don't count MindMed."
2021-05-27 16:13:18,wallstreetbets,I’ve been holding bb for a bit average around 11 but I bought some 12.5 June 4th options late yesterday that are doing well today. Hoping tomorrow continues the green line and I might cash out then
2021-05-27 14:52:47,wallstreetbets,"I feel dumb, I was hoping it would go back to 8 CDN before so I could average lower since I've been in since 10 :( but didn't still not enough faith though to average up haha"
2021-05-27 17:08:32,wallstreetbets,Me too. Beginning of day.
2021-05-27 15:24:39,wallstreetbets,21.75 here

Nice to be in the green for the first time."
2021-05-27 12:00:34,wallstreetbets,So say we all!
2021-05-27 14:10:19,wallstreetbets,Is BB actually going to moon? I feel like it's going to steadily increase over the years since it's more of a long term investment.
2021-05-27 14:05:23,wallstreetbets,Where my forgotten NOK peeps at?

2021-05-27 16:48:50,wallstreetbets,"Haha, same here! Bought BB after reading a alot of good DD in here, think my average is around 8.60"
2021-05-27 16:37:32,wallstreetbets,"Nokia has 5.4B outstanding shares. A price movement of $0.01 equals to $50M change in valuation. It's hard for something with that many shares to have large price movements even as a short squeeze candidate. NOK went from $4.20 to $6.55 in the original short squeeze, that's a 12.6B change in valuation, almost a Coors, Gap, or Hasbro's worth. There was better return potential in the other 7 short squeeze stocks."
2021-05-27 15:36:13,wallstreetbets,Recently? AMC has been talked about non-stop since march
2021-05-27 16:52:04,wallstreetbets,For sure! If there's an impending crash I'm ready to buy more
2021-05-27 11:48:09,wallstreetbets,I fucking love this stock!!
2021-05-27 11:53:20,wallstreetbets,Been following amc all day moving my stop loss up every time the price moves up a dollar lol. Wont be caught bag holdin this time damnit lol
2021-05-27 12:05:53,wallstreetbets,"BB started as a meme stock, but it looks like a good long term buy."
2021-05-27 18:43:18,wallstreetbets,"This is the way, glad to not be alone!"
2021-05-27 14:22:41,wallstreetbets,Average down
2021-05-27 16:32:47,wallstreetbets,Try holding for 5 years.
2021-05-27 15:03:49,wallstreetbets,"MVIS was my worst performer, it dropped immediately after I bought it. Since I was down about 26%,  I decided to follow the advice of averaging down. Within a few days it shot up 98%. I took my investment out, so what was left is up about 38%. 

It seems a little weird but it works."
2021-05-27 19:39:01,wallstreetbets,Don't give up. It will go up BOOBZ. It will.
2021-05-27 17:53:14,wallstreetbets,26.6 here

2021-05-27 16:28:17,wallstreetbets,"Is in one of the 50 shortest stocks so is NOK  that’s why they are starting to green line. They are trailing off of GME, AMC follows and the rest that are shorted will too, but most likely won’t moon like the other two."
2021-05-27 14:53:28,wallstreetbets,"Oooooh so we should be buying long calls, heard"
2021-05-27 16:33:52,wallstreetbets,It won't moon like GME and AMC because there are too many shares outstanding and no near-term catalysts.
2021-05-27 14:26:25,wallstreetbets,sold it all the other day and bought more  AMC at $16
2021-05-27 15:27:52,wallstreetbets,"I have some bb but have ton of NOK. Nokia is a value stock and is still undervalued right now, I'll climb eventually"

2021-05-27 12:53:51,wallstreetbets,"Business wise yes,alot! But I ment today is moving up more % wise not by much but there"
2021-05-27 16:41:40,wallstreetbets,"Yes I realize that, and that NOK run up made me a lot of money.  It can be done again.  AMC has made me a lot of money as well recently, but it's incredibly overvalued currently."
2021-05-27 15:41:13,wallstreetbets,"Yes it's been mentioned, it had a nice run up in February then went down to 8-10 area for some time.  Recently meaning it just had the big move."
2021-05-27 14:41:56,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-27 15:08:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I don’t have that kind of money, I kind of went all in on BB"
2021-05-27 16:47:12,wallstreetbets,"I agree with some others today in thinking a small hedge fund was margin called. Even my worst performing ""meme"" stocks have gained ground. I think it will turn around."
2021-05-27 16:41:56,wallstreetbets,This isn't r/investing
2021-05-27 15:09:30,wallstreetbets,"It works if you have capital however I went all in on BB, I don’t have the capital to average down"
2021-05-27 17:02:47,wallstreetbets,I feel your pain on MVIS still holding it.
2021-05-27 17:20:00,wallstreetbets,"Mine is MNMD. Remember when everyone hyped that? Yeah, my (unrealized) loss."
2021-05-27 16:11:27,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you
2021-05-27 16:37:16,wallstreetbets,"I've been doing this primarily on one account to rebuild from an insane 5k -> 1k growth. It's been working well, the price action in March helped grow my positions more. Just make sure you're not getting in too high otherwise when BB inevitably drops for a while your faith will get tested."
2021-05-27 15:23:38,wallstreetbets,I want out of both personally 😅 more GME!
2021-05-27 13:04:21,wallstreetbets,Im long on bb..but it has moved glacially since the hf fuckery
2021-05-27 15:51:19,wallstreetbets,"...GME and AMC have been talked about almost exactly as much since March, both on Reddit and in the mainstream media...  Actually, AMC moreso because of theaters opening up. What are you on?

Run is one thing, popularity is another. It's been popular for months is what I'm saying and the important thing to grasp. As for the price, it has been littered with manipulation and artificial moves - which this current spike is feeling like and we'll see it dip back to the 16-19 range by the weekend so that when it rises above $20 again on Monday, cowards are scared into selling."
2021-05-27 16:46:35,wallstreetbets,you earn money atleast biweekly
2021-05-27 16:53:49,wallstreetbets,"Now we just gotta corner slightly bigger hedge funds. And bigger. And bigger. Think ""God of War."" ;)"
2021-05-27 16:03:36,wallstreetbets,"Dont worry, I made the same mistake"
2021-05-27 15:28:11,wallstreetbets,"I made that mistake as a ""newbie"". I have some in BB and couldn't take advantage of the dip. I would be up a hell of a lot more if I knew that when I started."
2021-05-27 18:02:52,wallstreetbets,"Lol I have that sucky one too! I have small positions in companies, using them like bookmarks, just to keep an eye on them."
2021-05-27 18:38:10,wallstreetbets,sold my first CSP on that this week...i may be in line for another learning experience
2021-05-27 16:46:02,wallstreetbets,"I'm a poor boy , so I can only buy calls in small numbers lol, but it makes me care less about watching the loss.
Also, I've managed to hold a fully red portfolio for months at a time, I think I'll be good😅😂

Momma didn't raise no paper handed retard"
2021-05-27 14:39:26,wallstreetbets,"It moved pretty quick, just moved the wrong direction."
2021-05-27 17:08:52,wallstreetbets,"The fact that I post on this sub should tell you, I lose money at least biweekly"
2021-05-27 18:38:50,wallstreetbets,watch lists are a less expensive way to do the same thing...lol
2021-05-27 16:58:55,wallstreetbets,I feel ya. I think I went from around 4 cheap calls that did well to 9 that I'm now playing the waiting game on. It's always fun to see green when your bb stock avg cost is higher than current 😄🤡 Helps make up for prior mistakes.
2021-05-27 19:33:10,wallstreetbets,Have an upvote!

2021-05-27 11:44:51,wallstreetbets,I think AMC changed people lives.  I had 10 $15 Dollar calls but im on vacation and had a stop loss of 1.50 but no complaints. paid for the Honeymoon
2021-05-27 11:38:38,wallstreetbets,Take all my money

2021-05-27 12:15:58,wallstreetbets,Fill us in when you're back to 10k.
2021-05-27 11:46:33,wallstreetbets,Bravo.  Set some aside for Uncle Sam now so you don't fuck yourself later.
2021-05-27 11:59:57,wallstreetbets,Great.. I lost everything and am out.. almost the same
2021-05-27 11:42:14,wallstreetbets,Wanna give me 10 k so I can do the same 🤷🏾‍♂️
2021-05-27 14:11:16,wallstreetbets,You knew exactly what you were doing OP...congratulations and fuck you...I swear my option plays either get me little profit or no profit at all..but im the idiot that gets weekly options and let’s them expire worthless
2021-05-27 14:48:59,wallstreetbets,but how much money did you lose first to end up with only 10k?
2021-05-27 15:39:55,wallstreetbets,"Lol that insane AMC weekly, don't try this at home kids."
2021-05-27 12:06:14,wallstreetbets,Let us all admire his profits. Let us all learn that VOLUME is key to gaining this much too. I only trade with 5-10 contracts per time and see some modest gains before selling. Im thinking of adding another $$$ more just so I can get volume and trade like this Man.
2021-05-27 11:42:12,wallstreetbets,"AMC is about the luckiest trade ever. Sell and be happy you made gains.

And congratulations."

Congrats and fuck you."
2021-05-27 13:15:30,wallstreetbets,What are you using to buy and trade?
2021-05-27 13:37:15,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain to a smooth brainer that is new to investing like me what these calls and trades you are making mean? I am so lost, but so happy for your gains."
2021-05-27 13:22:49,wallstreetbets,Thank you AMC
2021-05-27 16:20:23,wallstreetbets,"Brilliant, the best play I have seen on this sub, shows that you don't need to start with a fortune to make a big return"
2021-05-27 19:31:42,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you
2021-05-27 19:53:44,wallstreetbets,I need confidence to YoLO money on risky stuff like this.. why did you hedge your SPY position and not hedge your AMC position? You were expecting the mad AMC momentum?
2021-05-27 12:00:36,wallstreetbets,QQ: are you verified to day trade or were these using your allotted round trips within a specific time frame?
2021-05-27 13:54:30,wallstreetbets,I really need to learn what puts and calls are.
2021-05-27 11:46:42,wallstreetbets,This is ludacris. Savage!! One day I will be just like you!!!! May good things happen to you and your family!
2021-05-27 12:31:10,wallstreetbets,You are a fucking legend.

2021-05-27 12:31:32,wallstreetbets,What would be a good broker thing to use for options? I’m tryna dive into options since I’m not broke enough
2021-05-27 11:46:28,wallstreetbets,How is that possible?
2021-05-27 17:14:04,wallstreetbets,Wheres the 10k to 364k? All i see is 86% gain
2021-05-27 18:02:15,wallstreetbets,started at $400 and now over $3800
2021-05-27 13:55:58,wallstreetbets,Ape confused. Your numbers are green and don’t have a dash in front of them. Does that mean you eat green crayons? How did you remove the dash?
2021-05-27 18:49:20,wallstreetbets,The fucked up thing is if he didn’t sell he would be sitting on a mill right now
2021-05-27 17:41:24,wallstreetbets,"weekly OTM options 2 days from expiration? I think you have better odds rolling a single number on a roulette in Vegas. 

I also bet you blew up a few 10k accounts before this win.

GL bud"

2021-05-27 17:56:49,wallstreetbets,"This is very interesting being the past 3 days, SPY was going sideways a lot too where it was hard to predict it going up or down. It looks bearish and bullish too where it was way too risky making any trades.

Then I saw AMC giving you that boost."
2021-05-27 18:04:41,wallstreetbets,"1,000th comment - you the man.  That last $18 call was epic."

2021-05-27 16:25:12,wallstreetbets,I would cash out now and put it in safe investments. You can lose all that just as fast as you earned it.
2021-05-27 16:25:24,wallstreetbets,Nice. Hope that's all in an IRA so you're not losing $138k to taxes.
2021-05-27 16:26:03,wallstreetbets,"TOO BAD, my bank doesn't sell options/contracts.

2021-05-27 16:30:29,wallstreetbets,I turned my 10k into 10k... nothing works
2021-05-27 16:31:37,wallstreetbets,"Someone walk a lower ape through this...

If OP had the $10,000 as something he was totally prepared to lose...did he at ANY POINT risk more than $10,000 initial investment + ANY amount of ""house money?""

Like could he ever have lost more than his $10,000? (effectively risking more than the $10k) I think this is the last hurdle I have in understanding options. The buying/selling of calls/puts makes sense to me, but I have wondered at times if someone thinks they are risking $10,000 without realizing they can lose $100,000. (bc the $10k is only part of a ""down payment"" of the heavy leverage)

So if unclear, English is my first language, but I am not wise"
2021-05-27 16:34:04,wallstreetbets,Wow

2021-05-27 19:57:22,wallstreetbets,Wtf
2021-05-27 19:57:45,wallstreetbets,AMC is the way
2021-05-27 19:59:08,wallstreetbets,"Save money for taxes, trust me."
2021-05-27 19:59:11,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you
2021-05-27 19:59:38,wallstreetbets,and next week you'll be at the bread line
2021-05-27 15:50:08,wallstreetbets,Pointless post. Keep it to yourself. Go buy cocaine and strippers
2021-05-27 15:31:10,wallstreetbets,"You’re gonna lose it all. 
I have no doubt, unless you cash out. That’s what you won’t lose"
2021-05-27 17:18:33,wallstreetbets,I wish things were orchestrated better on this thread so that we could all manipulate the price and get rich asf.
2021-05-27 14:20:52,wallstreetbets,That is still risky as fuck. Sell the option and buy shares now.
2021-05-27 15:34:46,wallstreetbets,I am INSPIRED! Not letting my lost rent money get me down! Just bought 35 options in Beyond Meat (BYND) I'm not missing the next short squeeze
2021-05-27 16:13:32,wallstreetbets,Wait this is wsb fucking sellouts

2021-05-27 17:28:29,wallstreetbets,*IRS has entered the chat.*
2021-05-27 18:21:06,wallstreetbets,Yeah sure you did
2021-05-27 18:31:11,wallstreetbets,"Someone please help me do this! I'll help you work on your car or something. Trade knowledge for knowledge or something, we'll figure it out. My family is going to be homeless on Sunday. My dad is in a coma and his work is fucking him out of his retirement money. The city bought the place we were living and are kicking us out to the street. The USPS won't let us get our mail and are returning it all back to sender. Shelters are full of the 100k+ prisoners California released because of covid. People who are convicted child rapists, people involved in theft rings, people who go around shooting other random people just because. This last week alone 3 people, including a 6yr old kid, were shot and killed while in a car on the freeway! Its getting worse rapidly. Each one of us is medically jacked up in some form and even when we tried to get a job recently as things have been opening up, we are turned away because we don't have an address, don't seem reliable because how much is going on, and we don't have everything they want. We've been living in poverty our whole lives and I dont want to see my parents suffer anymore. My dad's worked for the same place for 35 years and when he went into his coma, they basically stole his retirement. My moms had a heart attack and has 8 stints and now sleeps alone without her husband after 30 years next to each other. The long term care facilities that my dads been to have been mistreating him. They've dropped him on his face, he's had infections, rashes, and sores they couldn't explain (except the bed sores he has), and he even ended up with a UTI. Thats absolutely unacceptable. My dad's sacrificed everything he ever had and always chose others over himself and this is how he gets thanked? We've been trying every day to make a better life and get anywhere to live and every day some agency or organization steps in and shits all over it. Its pushed me to the point where I'm only living to make sure my dad gets taken care of. I've sold everything I have just to make it this far. I dont understand the market or how to get started and I dont have any money to invest. I found all my pokemon card collections going back to at least 98 but I dont have the time to sell them or wait for them to get graded. My dad is laying on a cold hospital bed able to hear everything but unable to see or move. Imagine being in that situation. I love my dad and I never got to spend a lot of time with him and the morning he had his asthmatic episode, we all did what we could to keep him alive. He ended up dying on my shoulders and with the help of a stranger, my brother, and the paramedics, we got a heartbeat after 5 minutes. The system is not helping us, the city state and government assistance programs refuse to help, and we're 2 days away from living on the street. Im not asking for free shit, im asking to barter your skills for my skills or time once I can secure somewhere to live. This is no fake b.s. and im not a prince from Zimbabwe. Im from a shithole town in Southern California full of fucked up people. I just want to see my family smile for once.."
2021-05-27 13:14:49,wallstreetbets,"I think it means they made something called money. I'm not too sure though, it's not something I've ever done."
2021-05-27 14:28:10,wallstreetbets,"Ah, did you buy high and sell low? If not you're missing out on some cheap tendies from Wendy's."
2021-05-27 16:21:25,wallstreetbets,And that's why I don't fuck with options. Co-worker of mine bragged for a week about making 10k on tesla options a while back.  A month later he lost it all the same way.
2021-05-27 15:44:29,wallstreetbets,You turned your 10k into part of his 375k. Short term trading is a zero sum game
2021-05-27 15:05:11,wallstreetbets,Lmfao I’m sorry but shit that makes my loss feel easier.. were you playing options?
2021-05-27 16:22:00,wallstreetbets,Hey man I was down to my last $166 yesterday and threw it all in amc and now I’m at $2750! There’s still hope!
2021-05-27 16:17:17,wallstreetbets,i think everyone is laughing because you accidentally left the K off the end of your post making it appear as though you suffered a ridiculous loss.
2021-05-27 16:22:57,wallstreetbets,"Damn you with your remaining money! I turned 30k into zero once.

Never looked back. Never made any more than that.

Looking for a job."
2021-05-27 17:51:55,wallstreetbets,"Turned my $10,000 into $200 from January to early May. Just hit $6,000 today. Still down quite a bit, but I thought I was entirely fucked.

Bought a few GME $230c on Monday. Lucked out. 

The FD giveth and the FD taketh. But mostly taketh."

2021-05-27 19:07:57,wallstreetbets,did you try asking for a refund
2021-05-27 19:20:44,wallstreetbets,If upvotes were dollars you'd be even.

2021-05-27 17:55:07,wallstreetbets,I thought you meant $163k and then remembered the sub I'm on
2021-05-27 17:57:52,wallstreetbets,Lmfaooo lmfaoo. Haven't laughed this hard in a long time.
2021-05-27 18:05:27,wallstreetbets,Are you a hedge fund?
2021-05-27 18:09:00,wallstreetbets,Make an actual post with a screenshot so we can celebrate you properly

2021-05-27 18:40:01,wallstreetbets,"When I first start d trading I only put $4,500 into a separate account to play with.  After a lot of hard work and research I was able to turn it into $2,200.  Then thanks to AMD who I had bet decent on jumped to the $20’s and got all plus some back.  That account is sitting quietly almost solely in SCHD now and a 100 shares of AMC."
2021-05-27 18:41:45,wallstreetbets,You were just supporting op
2021-05-27 19:14:13,wallstreetbets,At least you've got all this karma now!
2021-05-27 19:14:47,wallstreetbets,HEY! You still got a chip and a chair... Hang in there!

2021-05-27 19:49:10,wallstreetbets,LOL
2021-05-27 17:58:55,wallstreetbets,I mean...yous a sucker...
2021-05-27 18:56:59,wallstreetbets,Cuz you're an idiot
2021-05-27 19:23:11,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service
2021-05-27 12:07:27,wallstreetbets,Does your wife need a boyfriend OP?
2021-05-27 12:18:22,wallstreetbets,The highest compliment I could receive. Thank you.
2021-05-27 17:48:13,wallstreetbets,"OP had the balls to throw 38k at OTM options that expire in 4 days. Strike price of 18 when AMC hasn't been over 18 since January, even then it was only over 18 for only two hours, been lower ever since.

&#x200B;

Each of OPs balls are so heavy they probably form their own black holes."
2021-05-27 15:14:15,wallstreetbets,This no good for my mental health
2021-05-27 15:06:40,wallstreetbets,This is some real gain porn
2021-05-27 15:43:35,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you turned 10k to 500k in a matter of days, AND closed out....

Absolute legend

You can brag about this for the rest of your life"
2021-05-27 12:15:33,wallstreetbets,Jesus fuck. You inspire me. Have an award.
2021-05-27 14:12:37,wallstreetbets,Big dick moves. Congrats and fuck you
2021-05-27 12:10:59,wallstreetbets,I understood none of that. Congrats
2021-05-27 12:54:32,wallstreetbets,"Saw this screenshot and knew you had to be the same degenerate he called out on the stream. Congrats, and fuck you!"
2021-05-27 15:52:30,wallstreetbets,"congrats and fuck you, living the dream, quit while youre ahead, dont forget taxes"
2021-05-27 12:55:51,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure how long you've been doing this, and I don't want to take away from your genius, but you got extremely lucky. If you haven't already, I would withdraw at least half of that $364k so you're only playing with house money. Just my 2 cents.

Oh yeah, congrats and fuck you."
2021-05-27 14:22:01,wallstreetbets,The funniest thing is you made insane gains yet you could have just made ludicrous gains with AMC tickling 30 but ofc good call.
2021-05-27 13:41:03,wallstreetbets,The only thing I'm confused about is how did you double your money buying and selling 15.5 calls when the stock price hit 15.5?
2021-05-27 14:44:01,wallstreetbets,"Half a million off of fucking AMC calls.

Please for the love of tendies don't lose it. PLEASE store at least 50% of it in untradable cash.

CONGRATS!"
2021-05-27 13:34:53,wallstreetbets,Honest question.  What’s the advantage of selling and rolling into new options vs just holding onto the original call?
2021-05-27 12:14:31,wallstreetbets,Ohhhh fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck you dude and congrats
2021-05-27 16:05:55,wallstreetbets,"This was a masterpiece. Truly admirable, happy fuck you."
2021-05-27 16:53:09,wallstreetbets,">  into $15.50 AMC calls expiring. A few hours later when AMC hit 15.50

I don't understand how options work at all.  If you bought 15.50 calls and sold at 15.50, isn't the amount of money gained $0? 

Be gentle, I'm retarded."
2021-05-27 13:38:09,wallstreetbets,Wish I knew what all this means
2021-05-27 14:47:15,wallstreetbets,Can I give you money and do this so I can pay of my mortgage?? A measly $145k... 😫
2021-05-27 18:17:22,wallstreetbets,"I'm too dumb for calls and puts apparently.  Good on you, sir.  One day maybe I'll figure it out, but probably not."
2021-05-27 14:35:36,wallstreetbets,How do I go about doing this if I live in Canada ? Is there an app I can use ?
2021-05-27 15:02:41,wallstreetbets,"When you say expiring, do you mean this week on Friday?"
2021-05-27 14:16:47,wallstreetbets,How does one practice this with paper trading?
2021-05-27 13:28:33,wallstreetbets,This is just absolutely insane... Incredible 😍
2021-05-27 14:07:51,wallstreetbets,Just so I understand. You bought 15.50 calls people were selling because they didn't want to exercise to buy the stock. You then sold those yourself without exercising. Is that right?
2021-05-27 14:35:36,wallstreetbets,Maybe I will try options at some point. Congrats!
2021-05-27 15:40:05,wallstreetbets,"In all honesty, I don’t know how this works, but I really want and need to.  I’m quite inspired to learn something right now, for my family and their future. Thanks for this post. I’m reading all I can now."
2021-05-27 15:42:29,wallstreetbets,"serious question. when one of those turns on you and you go back down to McDouble levels, how tf do you handle taxes next year?"
2021-05-27 16:14:33,wallstreetbets,Spend it all on hookers and blow before you pay your taxes on it.
2021-05-27 16:50:38,wallstreetbets,"Congrats man, couldn't get my shit on point today. Ended up down $600 on all these crazy runs."
2021-05-27 17:12:57,wallstreetbets,I really need to learn this wizardry so I can hurry up and fuck up my financials
2021-05-27 18:10:41,wallstreetbets,"When you mean buying expiring calls, you mean these calls are set to expire this Friday?"
2021-05-27 18:17:06,wallstreetbets,As per the WSB tradition: Don't quit while you're ahead! Put it all on black at roulette.
2021-05-27 18:49:41,wallstreetbets,So what are you doing for the rest of the year?
2021-05-27 19:30:06,wallstreetbets,"Omg I wish I understood any of this. I’m true Ape, dumb af. I can barely write my own name and now you add math? I’d invest that kinda of money if I was as smart as you! Lol"
2021-05-27 14:29:56,wallstreetbets,"Me retarded and me do not understand calls, or contracts or puts. Lord ape where can I learn and congratulations."
2021-05-27 13:53:42,wallstreetbets,"Well played, congrats."
2021-05-27 14:01:41,wallstreetbets,"Congrats man that’s gotta feel awesome, any tips for day trading? I feel like I understand it, but I don’t get how some people are making so much from it."
2021-05-27 14:30:13,wallstreetbets,Wait what?
2021-05-27 14:31:02,wallstreetbets,What made you decide to go for AMC calls this week as opposed to any other time?
2021-05-27 14:54:12,wallstreetbets,That fucking amazing dude congrats
2021-05-27 14:58:37,wallstreetbets,fcking great trades bruh.  now the taxes...all worth it though heh
2021-05-27 15:08:41,wallstreetbets,Is this a margin account?
2021-05-27 15:12:55,wallstreetbets,Congratulations my man. I would be stoked.
2021-05-27 15:13:49,wallstreetbets,you are the man

2021-05-27 15:22:04,wallstreetbets," Nice work!!!  I need to get smarter on this stuff. 

Also I’m an AZguy too but 101…not 303.still west side tho."
2021-05-27 15:26:35,wallstreetbets,What program do you use for trading?
2021-05-27 15:30:40,wallstreetbets,"This is a better post.  Congrats, great plays.  Now go buy a house and a nice dinner."
2021-05-27 16:00:37,wallstreetbets,I have no idea how to even make these purchases on stocks but this is motivating on how to learn
2021-05-27 16:07:34,wallstreetbets,but you're gonna roll the 500k into something else right?
2021-05-27 16:07:52,wallstreetbets,You jammy bastard. Nice one. And fuck you
2021-05-27 16:15:53,wallstreetbets,"first off: congratz and fuck you!

second: I wish I knew how to buy calls in germany. trade republik doesn‘t offer calls on amc 😔"
2021-05-27 16:21:09,wallstreetbets,"Honestly congratulations, hands down some of the best shit I’ve seen recently. Care to explain why you yolod on weeklies at this particular time ? Any TA or analysis to have backed it ?"
2021-05-27 16:23:58,wallstreetbets,you are an inspiration
2021-05-27 16:27:33,wallstreetbets,I'm not gay but I'd suck your dick

2021-05-27 17:31:03,wallstreetbets,Maybe I should try doing calls.
2021-05-27 17:32:37,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-27 17:52:08,wallstreetbets,Eli5 if you can...what would have to happen for that to go wrong and you end up margin called? I'm trying to get my head around all this
2021-05-27 17:57:06,wallstreetbets,God?
2021-05-27 18:04:59,wallstreetbets,"I really don't understand, if the actual price for AMC went up like 40% in the past few days, how did you make so much money?"

2021-05-27 19:47:09,wallstreetbets,I wish I had the knowledge and means to do this. It must just feel so great to not feel any financial pressure for a while. Kudos to those who are.
2021-05-27 19:49:01,wallstreetbets,Where do I buy theses calls you speak of?
2021-05-27 19:55:05,wallstreetbets,Wow my cashapp is $mctrades01 btw 😉😅😭
2021-05-27 13:07:16,wallstreetbets,they're doing it wrong
2021-05-27 17:21:31,wallstreetbets,You guys have money?
2021-05-27 18:22:41,wallstreetbets,"Just think back to all the loss porn we've seen of $18 AMC calls. 

This guy made a winning bet, and all those other losers were too early. And there are so many more losers than winners."
2021-05-27 15:50:49,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-05-27 18:52:01,wallstreetbets,"Well, if you can build a big enough stash, then you can leverage that towards posting some truly epic loss porn. The thing is, like any community, this one is subject to saturation. If we see $10k-25k losses all the time, they become commonplace enough that you really don't feel like your loss porn was given its proper due. 

Add a zero or two to those losses, and then the community will take notice."
2021-05-27 18:56:54,wallstreetbets,"You have to sell low, buy high. I've been doing it for years."
2021-05-27 18:59:43,wallstreetbets,"Well I don't mean to brag, [but I 10x my investment on an FD](https://imgur.com/9C81K8u.png) call option today.

I think this is my first call option to not end up expiring worthless and I only put $5 into it because I still had an few dollars cash on robinhood and I figured I'd just waste it on a cheap call and this happened. Goddamnit, life is so stupid."
2021-05-27 19:12:09,wallstreetbets,Wait you guys have money
2021-05-27 14:57:37,wallstreetbets,Congrats my dude! That counts as a win.
2021-05-27 15:53:28,wallstreetbets,"> I think AMC changed people lives.

For sure, in both directions. The short term stock market is a zero-sum game. Every gain is someone else’s loss."
2021-05-27 11:39:38,wallstreetbets,And my wife
2021-05-27 17:40:16,wallstreetbets,That’s how a zero sum game works! Fun stuff!
2021-05-27 18:42:30,wallstreetbets,He already did

Actual example: I'll make an agreement with Tom to pay him $10 for the right to buy his 100 Snicker's bars at a price of 2$ per Snickers bar. This agreement will expire June 1st. That's the call. 

Right now, his Snickers bar is worth 1$. If June 1st comes around and his Snickers bars are worth $1.50 on the market, the call is worthless because anybody, including me, can go buy Snickers from the market for cheaper than the agreement I had with Tom. I just paid $10 to make this contract that turned out to be useless. I lost $10.

IF it's June 1st and Snickers are now worth $3 per bar, I will exercise my contract with Tom and pay him $2x100 = $200. I now have 100 Snickers bars that are worth $3 each or $300 total. Subtract the $10 I paid for the contract and you have a profit of $90 if you sell your 100 Snickers on the market immediately after exercising my contract. 

Hopefully this made sense."

2021-05-27 17:57:38,wallstreetbets,It’s gambling.  On average the people selling the options are making the money.  The house always wins at the casino.  Selling options is also risky and usually has small returns that are limited with infinite loss potential so not good for small accounts.

2021-05-27 18:49:29,wallstreetbets,"\>untradable cash 

serious retard advice"
2021-05-27 13:39:28,wallstreetbets,You get to buy more cheaper premiums that multiply faster. Let's say you have 10 option contracts and the premium value is $2 each. If you think the stock is going to keep going up you can sell that $2 and buy 40 out of money contracts for 50 cents. If it goes up you just multiplied your gain significantly. It doesn't go past the new strike price you can lose it all.
2021-05-27 17:11:52,wallstreetbets,"So there is the stock price and then the price of the option contract. The option contract has intrinsic and extrinsic value and it's highly correlated to the stock price and the expiration date of the contract.. 

So when I bought the $15.50 call the stock price was around $13 and I paid $.59 ($59) per contract. So at the time of my purchase the break-even price would be $16.09. (15.50 strike price plus .59) ... 

Now immediately after I bought it the stock price went up to $15.50. I then sold the calls for $1.12 each because value of the contracts go up in relation to the stock price. So the person who bought them from me would need the stock price to get to $16.72 ($15.50+$1.12). 

So I took the money from my calls and I rolled them to cheaper options which were $18 strike price calls that only cost .55 ($55) per contract. So I was betting that the price was going to go above $18.55 by expiration day Friday.

2021-05-27 16:29:46,wallstreetbets,"TA: it has been making higher highs and lower lows the past 3 months. Once it broke over the eight level and held I knew it was a matter of time for it to retrace.

Fundamentals: about a month ago Borrow utilization was above 90% with heavy borrow fees and steadily increasing price. Short interest was around 20 to 25% as well. 

Also it was a reopening play, the better the vaccines the more people are going to movies. That weekend mortal Kombat came out and the ticket sales crushed it kicked off the stock rise as the shorts were getting heavier. 

Timing is really hard to get. If you look at my history I was playing the last 3 weeks. Two weeks ago I went up a hundred thousand, them to last week got crushed and lost 90,000, volume picked up again Monday so I thought there was a hell of a good chance happening this week.. 

And I was lucky"

I know some American brokers will cover the cost and take that once the shares are sold at profit/autosell but I'm Canadian and I suspect the shares won't be sold automatically and I would have to pay up IF ITM...

2021-05-27 17:29:45,wallstreetbets,So now you sell your options to someone that’s willing to buy at that price? What if there’s no one in the market wanting to do that? Do they expire and you lose it all?

I’ve been trading as a hobby for 20 years and have had my ups and downs but this year I actually started getting a few grey hairs on my chin from the stress lol.. so now I’m just not chasing multi baggers I prefer not baby sitting stocks all day so as of last month I’ve been focusing on just picking up monthly dividend paying etfs .. so far I have JEPI WHICH is a great new etf that has an impressive strategy aside from large cap stocks they do covered call options.. definitely worth looking into! And there’s no minimum like many etfs. It’s name is jp Morgan income equity etf

2021-05-27 15:09:33,wallstreetbets,rofl this sub has gone to shit. +10 for not understanding what a simple call or rolling an option is and -8 for calling him a retard.
2021-05-27 19:44:55,wallstreetbets,I need someone to teach me 🤦🏽‍♂️
2021-05-27 15:18:09,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Wow that is awesome!
2021-05-27 14:55:45,wallstreetbets,Hahaha best one yet
2021-05-27 14:41:17,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the reply. Does this mean that the price and value of call contracts changes as the stock price changes and the expiration date draws closer? I was under the impression they were fixed when written.
2021-05-27 16:49:47,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely. I’m not looking to get rich quick (though who wouldn’t love that?)... But I am looking for someway to stop drowning.  I’ve always been fascinated with stocks and this is a side of it I’ve never been exposed to.  Knowledge equals power, and I really need some power right now."
2021-05-27 16:46:48,wallstreetbets,"If it's a Roth, you can take it out early, you just have to pay the cap gains and a 10% penalty."
2021-05-27 19:01:52,wallstreetbets,"That sounds absolutely delightful.

Safe travels ☺️"
2021-05-27 14:49:52,wallstreetbets,Is the author Michael sincere. Thank you ape I will also search for YouTube videos. Do you know anyone in particular
2021-05-27 15:18:09,wallstreetbets,How much did you loose on options the last 3 weeks b4 the big hit this week
2021-05-27 15:10:25,wallstreetbets,how old are you
2021-05-27 15:34:48,wallstreetbets,"That’s awesome. Love seeing people succeed. I’m small time and way behind if things I should know by now (41) but putting money in stocks and crypto and trying to learn and pull good percentages and turn my 3 figures into 4. Then 4 to 5. 

Hopefully I’ll be able to post something like yours soon!  Congrats to you and your family!"

I made 25k off gme in January and have hated myself for dropping to 10k, questioning every move and having worse timing every week. Starting to recover this week, but every day I feel like pulling out just to prevent my fucking heart from stopping.lol"
2021-05-27 16:32:40,wallstreetbets,Interesting analysis. Well played and god speed to ya.

2021-05-27 18:29:53,wallstreetbets,does it have to be ROTH or any IRA is good

2021-05-27 17:14:35,wallstreetbets,Basically. I had 40K in collateral for iron condors. So I decided to take the 10K that I had profit from AMC the last 2 weeks and push it as hard as I could. I almost rolled my 18s to 21s yesterday but didn't pull the trigger. Would have worked like a charm though.
2021-05-27 17:46:28,wallstreetbets,Can confirm. I sell OTM weeklies to retards here. I always win.
2021-05-27 14:53:18,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely. No idea why I got downvoted. High short interest options plays aren’t a matter of if, but when. 🤷🏼‍♂️ so I guess that qualifies as luck? Wouldn’t say luckiest though."

2021-05-27 19:58:14,wallstreetbets,lol you mean gambling
2021-05-27 17:52:16,wallstreetbets,"Kind of. I lost about 10 to 15,000 learning about options the first few years... 

As far as AMC goes. I bet $40,000 2 weeks ago on weeklies and made 100,000 profit..

I rolled it to last week and lost $90,000... 

Wanted to Reduce my exposure and decided only to put 10K in but play it super aggressive. 

And yes I was hella lucky.

I've been posting the positions the past few weeks"
2021-05-27 17:32:17,wallstreetbets,Basically. You want to find stocks that have decent volume where you can sell. AMC for example traded over a half a billion today.
2021-05-27 18:44:28,wallstreetbets,"That's exactly what I'm doing with it. I'm basically doing a weekly iron condor with 25,000 capital each week. And buying leaps in EV."

I literally can't figure out what they mean.

Are you able to use them on platforms such as Robinhood (not a proponent, just asking) or only at places like Vanguard?"

2021-05-27 19:31:44,wallstreetbets,"they hold the money until settled, like 2days before you can use?"
2021-05-27 17:44:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah sorry, I'm still learning options. Thought you paid a premium buying calls and assumed you needed to put more down than that. 

Congrats, buddy!"
2021-05-27 17:25:19,wallstreetbets,Even if it doubled thats 400.

But stocks only go up and this was a sure thing right?"
2021-05-27 16:05:34,wallstreetbets,"sir, this is a wendy's."
2021-05-27 17:00:32,wallstreetbets,"Mathematically, if the chance is more than 2% that you'll be able to turn 10k into 500k, then it's worth it. 2% is 1 in 50. If you tried 50 times to turn 10k into 500k and succeeded once, you'd break even (assuming that all other 49 times you lost everything). Of course, you'd need a bankroll of more than $500k to afford this strategy."
2021-05-27 16:55:24,wallstreetbets,I'm wondering what the actual odds were here (and I'm sure someone will say 50%).
2021-05-27 17:17:16,wallstreetbets,"Man, this is correct."

I watched it for 10 years, waiting for a dip.  The dip never came.   Had I held it would have been worth tens of million of dollars.  FML.  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)"
2021-05-27 13:04:21,wallstreetbets,It's an IRA and don't need it right now plus don't want the taxes right now
2021-05-27 13:35:29,wallstreetbets,"that is 100% accurate and exactly how this will play out, normal trades will feel dull, seeking more and more gains, going higher and higher risk until it's all gone"
2021-05-27 15:41:31,wallstreetbets,"I've been playing at the last 3 weeks. Profited 100K 2 weeks ago. Lost 90k last week. Up 500k this week. Just the volume picking up, the social media involved, short interest and utilization, also being a reopening play and people going back to the movies would add to the fire."
2021-05-27 15:33:14,wallstreetbets,"Simply put it's fear.

The moment out of money options become near the money, if you don't exit your position (or have the stock to cover its exercise) you can face a stock squeeze. You as the bag holder will then need to deliver 100 share lots that can get more and more expensive to buy as you buy on increasing ticks.

Naked options have extreme risk to big changes in tickers."
2021-05-27 18:47:23,wallstreetbets,"In fact that’s probably the best way to profit off options. Sell as soon as you’re in the green. They lose value incredibly fast. Waiting for it to hit the strike price is a fools errand 

 \- guy who learned the hard way"
2021-05-27 14:45:23,wallstreetbets,Remember that the downside to switching to cheaper premium calls is that those have a higher chance of expiring OTM.
2021-05-27 18:28:34,wallstreetbets,"Yup. I'm buying to strictly sell at a higher price, not to excercise."

2021-05-27 15:26:52,wallstreetbets,"sincere? i don't know what that means.

i have no reco for videos, just search for what you want to know and watch videos until it makes sense. there are dozens of people making videos. there's a learning curve, it probably won't make sense right away.

in the beginning stick to just buying. later with more understanding you can expand to spreads, nakeds, and other strategies.

it's 80% mental, 20% mechanical. best!"
2021-05-27 17:23:26,wallstreetbets,Went up 100k 2 weeks ago. Down 90k last week. Use that 10K to play super aggressive and limit my exposure.
2021-05-27 15:38:50,wallstreetbets,"I'm 35 and just started 3 years ago. There's a lot of learning and I recommend paper accounts. I lost about 15 or 20,000 before I started catching my groove and finding different plays other than just calls or puts. Don't get confused I did research about this but this is 90% luck to get the exact timing with my contracts. I gambled on weeklies higher risk higher reward.   If this happened on Tuesday instead of this week would have lost the entire 10K."
2021-05-27 18:03:50,wallstreetbets,If I can suggest moving some money to clean energy. Buy and forget and play the game with the rest.

2021-05-27 14:59:23,wallstreetbets,I mean I was still lucky as hell. I was betting weeklies and you never know the exact day is going to happen.

Good luck man 👍"
2021-05-27 18:46:35,wallstreetbets,Sweet. Have you wheeled any tickers before? I'm curious to know how effective it is on high IV stocks like RKT
2021-05-27 17:55:06,wallstreetbets,"Wrong sub, this is the ape sanctuary not a financial school. But if you’re serious. A put is just a contract stating the seller will purchase from the holder of the contract, 100 shares at the strike price. It’s useful to buy one when you are worried an investment of shares you have might go down in value (below the strike). If it does you get to sell your shares for the strike. If not, you bought peace of mind for the premium. 

The seller of the put has to put up collateral to buy the shares (so 100 * strike price). And they get paid a premium. If the stock goes below they start losing money. If the stock doesn’t go below strike, they got free premium. 

From my experiences gambling around this place, puts blow unless you’re learning theta gang techniques. Or selling them on high IV to get really high premiums (just make sure you like the stock)."
2021-05-27 17:55:43,wallstreetbets,"Eliminate the word “put” from your vocabulary. Life is better as a bull, my friend."

2021-05-27 19:34:28,wallstreetbets,Options settle after 1 day on TOS
2021-05-27 17:53:19,wallstreetbets,"You pay a premium, but it’s cheaper than the shares at the time of purchase.  It’s kind of like using credit. It’s called leveraging.  I pay $1 for the option to buy a $15 stock for $20.  That is a $6 premium on the stock at the current price.  This seems like a bad deal at the time and it is.  But if the stock goes to $25 my $1 just turned into $5 because I can buy the stock for $20 and sell it for $25.  So if I am poor and can only afford $1 for the stock I can still get in on the gains.  my losses are also limited to $1 since I can’t go below $0."

2021-05-27 18:17:57,wallstreetbets,This stupidity is why I'm here
2021-05-27 19:08:01,wallstreetbets,"There's the utility factor of money. If that 10K is all that's keeping you from being homeless you should not risk it. You only live once goes both ways.

If you're financially set to where you can risk 10K 50 times and not suffer too bad then yeah you take those odds every week.

This is also why buying insurance makes sense even though it's mathematically not in your favor. Most people can not recover from the financial ruin of getting sick or losing 6 figures in a car accident lawsuit."

2021-05-27 16:18:00,wallstreetbets,"Still possible to do this without ever expecting to execute the calls. If there's a price spike and enough time left even OTM options typically see a decent tick up. Risky but we're already watching this guy in the casino.  


Like take AMC right now. MASSIVE price spike. If you think that'll pull back you could buy OTM puts and sell them back after they gain value even if they're never near the strike assuming they beat out the decay.   


Big advantage to OP rolling up is that he was able to have multiple exits and could have taken money out as long as the stock went up any appreciable rate. If you'd known AMC was going to spike to 25+ when it was at 10 you could have bought some $20 options and made a killing without incrementally buying/selling and rolling up."
2021-05-27 15:04:34,wallstreetbets,"So if there is a frenzy and the price is going up and down like crazy, this person took the risk it will go up?"
2021-05-27 16:21:01,wallstreetbets,"I know what a call is, just can’t wrap my head around how lucky this guy was and how he figured it out so quick. That’s why I’m on here, to learn and take some chances.   Retard is just one word I don’t like people to use on account of having friends with special needs children. It usually shows a sign of immaturity by the person  using the term."
2021-05-27 15:13:52,wallstreetbets,That would be great. Options is something I'm still wrapping my mind around.
2021-05-27 18:10:35,wallstreetbets,Great minds think alike. I literally started positions in clean energy this afternoon https://imgur.com/a/oRMyqvi
2021-05-27 13:53:17,wallstreetbets,"Yah youre right was thinking 75 was the max ur right its 70

Still not a big enough tax shelter for shit"
2021-05-27 16:09:12,wallstreetbets,"Well I literally got my first Roth IRA earlier this week. But it's through Fidelity and to my understanding you can have full control of all the funds and stocks within that account. I haven't tried options since I'm sticking to just buying/selling stocks.

There are yearly contribution limits to put money directly in. But you can fund a traditional IRA and then roll it over to a Roth. Then any gains in the Roth are not taxable because they were taxed before putting into the account.

But I'm not a financial advisor so do some more searching online and talk to your accountant."
2021-05-27 18:02:42,wallstreetbets,"ETSY, AMD, MU, DAL, SNAP, PTON. That's just a few off the top of my head. Sell puts on red days at strong supports. I aim to collect at least .30 per contract. Open numerous trades and it adds up. I'm up 5% portfolio growth in 2 weeks"
2021-05-27 16:18:53,wallstreetbets,Lol truth. Good on ya though. Takes massive fucking balls to keep rolling those calls.

2021-05-27 19:08:46,wallstreetbets,This. Is. SPARTA!
2021-05-27 17:37:16,wallstreetbets,"There are other factors at play that make it more complicated. On one hand, just because something has a 1 in 50 chance doesn't mean it'll happen within 50 attempts. It could take 100 attempts or 200 attempts. Theoretically, you could try it a million times and not succeed once (although this is very unlikely). So, you'd probably want to have enough money for more than 50 attempts. On the other hand, in reality there are more outcomes possible than simply either winning $500k or losing all of your money. You could pull your money out early if things don't look good and cut your losses. You might also have some attempts that result in smaller wins than $500k. Like, maybe you turn your $10k into $20k. So, you likely wouldn't need $500k to have enough money for 50 attempts."
2021-05-27 17:20:37,wallstreetbets,That's what they mean by bankroll.
2021-05-27 18:47:13,wallstreetbets,I went into a casino with 200 bucks and left with ~2600. Only time I've ever been. Because I will not let the casino beat me.
2021-05-27 19:09:33,wallstreetbets,I don't even have $10k to try this lmao!

2021-05-27 18:57:09,wallstreetbets,"Casinos always win because of the law of larger numbers and their house edge. Except for struggling casinos who don’t have their own sufficient bankroll, they don’t really care if individuals are winning or losing. They play statistics, not in individuals. 

Plenty of people are lifelong winners."
2021-05-27 18:18:33,wallstreetbets,"Not really. They put betting caps in place to stop the house from losing. Roulette, for example, in theory, you could just keep doubling your bet until you won back your loss. However, they have -max bets- in place , so even if you had a big enough bankroll, it would'nt work."
2021-05-27 18:58:03,wallstreetbets,"that's not how value works. it's not that you need to be able to repeat the bet, it's that that 10k can't have way more value to you than the potential winnings."
2021-05-27 18:17:23,wallstreetbets,With options it kind of is
2021-05-27 19:04:11,wallstreetbets,"True, with margin you can go from $10k to -$10k."
2021-05-27 18:40:11,wallstreetbets,"If you would not risk 10k to win 500k at 60% odds your a moron. I understand cases like the 10k saves your life or family member life and you have no other way of getting it, but give me a break."
2021-05-27 19:17:03,wallstreetbets,Too bad if it’s not a Roth
2021-05-27 13:36:15,wallstreetbets,he's not retiring at 35 with $375k lol
2021-05-27 13:40:39,wallstreetbets,Retire at 35 ? man go YOLO it in GME so that you can retire at 30.
2021-05-27 17:39:53,wallstreetbets,If it’s an IRA he can’t use it til he’s 59 and a half without paying taxes and (in most scenarios) penalties.
2021-05-27 17:54:51,wallstreetbets,Good point to illustrate that OP was still hedging along the way.
2021-05-27 15:11:31,wallstreetbets,"When you're buying a call, you bet on the stock going up. OTM just means you're being risky with the selected strike price relative to the selected expiration date; if the stock goes up a bunch, you're gonna get a higher multiplier on the OTM call. But if the stock stays neutral, or dips, your loss will be way worse. It's like a double edged sword"
2021-05-27 16:37:06,wallstreetbets,I’ll have you know I call myself a retard all the time!

2021-05-27 16:50:13,wallstreetbets,Can you explain why you need to do the trick with funding a traditional IRA and then rolling it over to a Roth instead of starting with a Roth directly?
2021-05-27 17:06:56,wallstreetbets,How do you roll over a traditional IRA to a Roth that's like a giant loophole on the $6000 yearly contribution limit

2021-05-27 17:29:09,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha, well yeah basically options give you a greater risk greater reward type deal. Stock goes up 50% your calls can go up 2000%"
2021-05-27 18:03:15,wallstreetbets,Please spend some time learning before YOLOing all in to options tomorrow. Outcomes are generally binary(you win or lose everything). Plus you should know when to book profits or take loss quickly or time decay will kill you despite the stock holding up ok.

2021-05-27 14:40:10,wallstreetbets,He can if he moves in with his wife and her boyfriend.
2021-05-27 17:07:27,wallstreetbets,"He actually could if he's, say, 25. He actually made $500k in total. If he just put that into an index and made 8% on average per year, he'd have $1.079 million by 35. If he made 12% a year, that would be over $1.5 million. At that point, you can just out everything in dividend stocks and live off of the dividend income for the rest of your life. Lol.

If he were to give it 20 years to build, he'd have $2-5 million. This guy could be set for life if he just treats most of this money as low-risk capital."
2021-05-27 17:05:10,wallstreetbets,"Depends on their age, but assuming they're 25 then just throw that 350k into S&P500 or some shit, reinvest those dividends, and preferably add as much as you can each year and by 35 you'd EASILY have a million. 

For example, if you put all that 365k into SPY, assume an 11% average yearly return for 10 years with dividends reinvested and you'd have about 1 million in 10 years without adding anymore money. 

That's not including the 150k more that OP made and it's not including any further investment. If you just take OPs 500k and put it into SPY, use the 10% lifetime historical average return, add no extra money to it AND don't reinvest your dividends, they'd be just shy of a million in 8 years. 

So yeah you could definitely retire of this money."
2021-05-27 16:19:25,wallstreetbets,"I mean at this rate, give him like 2 more trades and he can...

2021-05-27 17:13:28,wallstreetbets,"First I created a traditional IRA account with Fidelity and funded it. You still have the $6000 limit. Then I bought the shares and called customer support to do a rollover to a Roth IRA.

You have to wait for the shares to settle so you can't do it all in one day. But maybe if you rollover the cash it would be faster. The goal of doing the rollover is that you aren't allowed to fund a Roth IRA if your income is high enough in that year. If GME/AMC shoots the moon then your straight Roth deposit would be invalid.

By putting it in a traditional first, then rolling it over, you can bypass the income requirements.

# Discussion:

**What’s a good bet in the short term?**

Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Tech (didn’t think I’d be saying that) is looking pretty nice in the short term. The follow companies in Tech (XLK) have shown some strength and gone on a bit of a run.

https://preview.redd.it/utk79n1qlo171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c33200cbf190f0898afe16c76a22a9353257f036

The following companies are showing signs they may run up in the coming months. Personally, I’d narrow my research to these companies. I’m a semiconductor nerd, so I’m happy to see signs of a turnaround in INTC, AMD, and MU.

https://preview.redd.it/sz9ubhkslo171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=43812473c30a230ed2108ef37c6954bb2e3cda64

**What’s a good bet in the long term?**

Utilities (XLU), Consumer Staples (XLP), and Healthcare (XLV) all look like good sectors for long term bets. The problem is that they are starting to underperform the SPY in the short term.

XLRE seems to be floating around with the SPY, and slightly outperforming in the short term. 

Personally, I’m going to focus on short term investments within strong short term sectors until I see the trajectory for these long term plays start to turn around in the short term.

**This is a Casino Sir - My Bets/Positions:**

**XLK -– Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**

**XLY -– Long Call - 7/16 @ 0.7 delta**

Wanted to enter a PAYC PCS but the B/A was too wide.

**MU –- PCS – 7/16 @ 0.7 delta for credit > 1/3 strike width**

2021-05-27 11:16:46,wallstreetbets,Well. explain it to me then. I may actually be retarded. When do you buy and sell your contract?
2021-05-27 15:36:10,wallstreetbets,Ford?!?!  Clearly you missed the part where we all told you to go for that high risk stuff.
2021-05-27 11:16:20,wallstreetbets,Novice here. Always wondered how options work. Could you summaries the basics of it? Much appreciated!
2021-05-27 11:18:32,wallstreetbets,What was your strike price?

2021-05-27 11:39:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm still new to this. I guess I'm confused on how you made a profit. Am I right that if your strike price is $17, you were obligated to buy at $17/share? It looks like ford hasn't reached $17 so you bought higher than market price, right?"

2021-05-27 14:16:04,wallstreetbets,I too have been lucky with Ford today :) bought $10 calls way back in feb that expire 6/18 and bought more $13 calls maybe in March? Sold my $13 calls today for 40% profit. My $10 call is up 90% but I’m thinking about exercising bc I like the stock

2021-05-27 11:26:38,wallstreetbets,"I still have no idea what an ""option"", ""put"" or ""call"" mean, and every source ive tried so far has been extremely condescending."
2021-05-27 11:15:54,wallstreetbets,What app is that on?
2021-05-27 11:29:18,wallstreetbets,"Please feel free to correct me.
1) call option you are expecting the price to go up.
2) puts option you are expecting to go down.

long term options the price will be more but give you have longer time in market.
 short term options the price will be cheaper but you have less time in market.

Also the price depends on volatility of the stock.

Expiry time: the time your contract expires, before it expires you need to do either of these two.

1) sell your contract, don’t wait till the end you can only sell if there is some one to buy it. If you wait on the last day the chances are you won’t be able to sell it.

2) exercise the contract: which mean based on you contract you would have said I will buy the stock at $9 if it goes up $15. You can only do this if it’s goes above $15( which is your break even price)"
2021-05-27 11:25:56,wallstreetbets,Same here. Please teach.

2021-05-27 11:25:05,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-27 11:30:49,wallstreetbets,"Calls - provides the option to buy (call) for a stock at a specific price (ex: F is at 14.99, but you expect the stock price to rise over time you buy a call to buy F at 16, also called the strike price. There is a premium/charge per contract) so you may pay 5.00 per 100 contracts. in this example you’d be making money if F exceeds 21$ (the 16$ call + 5.00 charge)

Puts - pretty much the opposite of calls where you are expecting a stock price to fall and gives the option to sell (put) the stock a specific strike price. (Same ex: F is 14.99 but think it’s going to drop. You buy a put option to sell F at 12.99 at 2.00 per 100)... if the stock price drops below 10.99 (12.99-2.00) you make profit

This is excluding other more specific type of call/put options and look at calls vs puts. The internet could also explain it much better than I could, so if what I said doesn’t make sense I’d recommend doing a quick Google!"
2021-05-27 11:27:59,wallstreetbets,"Basically, its like paying a fee.

You pay a fee which gives you an option.

The option you gain is whether you want to buy 100 shares or not.

You buy the 100 shares at a set price depending on which option you paid a fee for.

If you choose the option to not to buy the 100 shares, you're still out the fee.

If you choose the option to buy the 100 shares, you get to buy the 100 shares at the set price that you paid a fee for.

Then you turn around and sell the shares. Or not.

You can also sell your option to someone else. Like if you don't have the money to buy the 100 shares.

This is what I'v learned. I'v never bought an option though so iono"
2021-05-27 11:28:25,wallstreetbets,They work by taking your $ 90% of the time and giving you $ 10% of the time

2021-05-27 11:46:29,wallstreetbets,"Instead of exercising the contract, which would be buying up the shares at the strike point like you mentioned, he probably sold the option for a premium that was higher than his own. You have the option to buy the 100 shares, or you can sell that option to buy 100 shares to someone else for a higher premium if the price is really volatile or if it just goes up enough"
2021-05-27 11:46:37,wallstreetbets,"I bought 100 contracts when the price was around $9. Each contract was $45( a contract would have 100 stocks), which said if the prices reaches $17 then I can excerise the contract and can buy 100 stocks at $9(when the market price of stock is $17+).

Current the stock price was $13+ this  also increased the contract price  from $45 to $200 for a single contract. I have 105 such contracts."
2021-05-27 12:27:25,wallstreetbets,"You are not *obligated* to buy for $17 a share. Since what you have is a contract, you have the *option* to *exercise* (*buy* the 100 shares at *strike price*) or *sell* the *contract itself* for whatever is worth at *anytime* you want (as long as it is *before it expires*), given if it is below, at or over the strike and break-even prices and how close it is to expiration will determine what it is worth when you sell and thus making a profit/loss. *Or* you can let it expire worthless (and lose the money you paid for up front).

You make a profit by getting closer and *passing* the break-even price. Other factors such as *time till expiration* affect this as well.

edit: reminder most of the time people don't exercise their options unless they really want to own the stock.

Hope this helps."
2021-05-27 14:44:16,wallstreetbets,I will be holding it too.

2021-05-27 11:43:38,wallstreetbets,"Also new to this, so maybe I have this wrong, but doesn't the price have to reach $17 before you can exercise your option?  So you haven't actually 'made money' yet have you?"
2021-05-27 11:38:14,wallstreetbets,What was the cost on the contracts?
2021-05-27 11:27:07,wallstreetbets,That might be a little too simple
2021-05-27 14:48:48,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the detailed explanation. Means a lot :)
2021-05-27 19:33:39,wallstreetbets,"So using AMC as an example (novice here too):

If I put in a Call of AMC at 100 shares for $15 and I can see the stock of AMC is $27 now, I can spend $1500+price of call to get my hundred shares for 1500 bucks? Then I could immediately sell it for $2700 if I wanted to?

I watched a couple videos but my smooth brain just wants someone to confirm this is the thinking."
2021-05-27 11:59:34,wallstreetbets,I see. So you're making a profit on the contracts rather than the stocks themselves. Very cool. Congrats!
2021-05-27 12:42:54,wallstreetbets,"Please look into this and correct me if im wrong, because im also new to options play:

I think 1 thing is wrong here, if you choose to exercise contract when it strikes $17, you will be buying 100 shares at $17 per contract, not $9. If it goes above, to like $20 you still able to exercises and buy at $17 x 100 shares per contract.

So i think you better off selling the contracts before due date than exercising, unless you have cash to exercise AND believe that it will goes beyond $17 ( if it goes $20, thats $3 profit per share, $300 profit per contract)."
2021-05-27 15:17:08,wallstreetbets,Very helpful. Thank you!

2021-05-27 11:51:18,wallstreetbets,"You can also sell the contract, you don’t need to wait for it to reach the strike price of $17. You can excerise the contract when it reached above $17. The value of contract increases as well."
2021-05-27 11:51:53,wallstreetbets,"No, you can exercise your options at any time. If you did this, you'd be buying the 100 shares at the ""strike price."" People usually don't exercise their contracts, unless they really want to hold and keep the underlying stock."

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"War profiteering for the common man Have you been watching the news over this past year and thought to yourself “there’s gotta be a way to turn these problems into money”? 

Did you secretly wish you were one of the degenerate gamblers from Star Wars: the Last Jedi? 

Have you ever seen the movie War Dogs staring known stock expert [Jonah Hill](https://www.businessinsider.com/jonah-hill-hospitalized-fake-cocaine-in-wolf-of-wall-street-2016-8)?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, I’ve got some juicy DD for you. No longer is profiting off of human uncertainty and violence exclusively a rich man’s game. Allow me to explain: 

Vista Outdoors ($VSTO) is an outdoor sports and recreation company that owns several recognizable brands such as Camelbak, Camp Chef, and Bushnell. But that’s not important. You’re reading this because you wanna make quick cash off of the collapse of society. Well $VSTO has got you covered.  

$VSTO owns a massive portion of the shooting sports market. In September of last year they acquired all of Remington’s ammunition factories, the last of which began full-scale production earlier this [year. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/aaronsmith/2021/02/04/bullet-sales-are-booming-as-vista-brings-remington-factory-online/amp/)

In addition to Remington, $VSTO also owns the ammunition brands Federal Premium, CCI, Hevi-shot, Estate Cartridge, and Speer. This accounts for the majority of ammunition produced in the US. 

They also own Alliant Powder, one of the largest producers of smokeless gunpowder in the United States.

You get the idea: if someone is buying ammo, they’re doing it through $VSTO. 

Why is this important? How will this make me money? 

Well right now the US is experiencing one of the largest ammunition shortages in [history.](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/cant-find-ammo-why-great-bullet-shortage-could-last-years-185734)

This shortage is being driven my unprecedented demand for guns and ammo. A combination of fears over [Biden’s ](https://joebiden.com/gunsafety/) gun control plans, a rise in civil unrest, and plain old boredom have caused ammo sales to [skyrocket.](https://thecrimereport.org/2021/01/13/gun-sales-spike-across-the-u-s-following-capitol-riots/) 

Last year roughly 9 million Americans bought guns for the first time. In January 2021 alone, the ATF reported 4.1 million background checks for gun purchases, the largest single month since record keeping [began](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/43371461)

All of these guns are being purchased, and you can’t find ammo fucking *anywhere*. I don’t think it takes a rocket surgeon to understand that guns are useless hunks of metal without ammo to make the boomsticks go boom. 

To prove my point, you can do a little experiment right now in the comfort of your wife’s boyfriend’s home. Try calling your local gun store and ask if you can come in today and purchase 500 rounds of 9mm ammo. When they laugh in your face you’ll see what I’m talking about. 

Late last year, when demand wasn’t as high as it is now, $VSTO reported a backlog of $1 billion dollars in ammunition sales. 1 fucking [BILLION.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/vista-outdoors-ammunition-backlog-billion.amp)
 
They have nearly [doubled ](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vsto/earnings) their estimated earnings for the past three quarters, and the trend shows no signs of slowing down. 

Their P/E ratio is still hovering at around 8.5/9.0 indicating that the stock is still criminally undervalued. 

This company is printing money as fast as they can make it, and they’ve just acquired more money making factories. You don’t need so much as a single brain wrinkle to understand what I’m saying. 

Fuck a rocket, I’m taking pure American lead and brass to the moon."

2021-05-27 11:16:51,wallstreetbets,So why is there a shortage of ammo and what are they doing to fix that? Just curious

Ammo is only is short supply on the local level. Online distributors are actually fairly well stocked."
2021-05-27 11:24:53,wallstreetbets,"Simply put, unprecedented demand. We’ve never had as many people trying to buy ammo as we do right now. There is a line outside of every gun store on days they get ammo shipments, and in a few hours the shelves look like a scene from a shitty apocalypse movie. 

Vista’s acquisition of Remington ammunition was done in-part to meet increasing demand, but the demand got even higher once Biden took office and the Capitol riot became a massive fiasco. They’ve also hired 1,500 new employees to keep their new factories churning out ammo as fast as possible.

Here is a video released by Federal’s president regarding their efforts 

https://youtu.be/KIgvoJKovIg"
2021-05-27 11:20:45,wallstreetbets,"They are looking to expand production but it can't be done immediately.  Takes time to build, hire and train qualified employees. I think they're also holding back production because they don't want to pull a Hillary Clinton where they oversupply. It's better to create a shortage and continue raising prices. Until people stop paying for ammo (it's still sold out everywhere), they can continue raising prices on lower quantity to increase profit margin.  


With the low P/E they have right now, imagine if a war broke out. This is a gold mine waiting to happen.  


I like their electric bike purchase too. With chip shortages and electric bikes becoming even more popular to travel around in, great acquisition for a green approach."

2021-05-27 12:07:33,wallstreetbets,"The majority of what is listed are foreign imports that are much more expensive than domestically manufactured counterparts. I’m also seeing a lot of steel cased ammo which is widely disliked among gun owners for having a reputation of being low-quality and corrosive. Even with all of this, every price listed is about 60-100% more expensive than what you can expect at a local gun store when ammunition is available (at least in my experience). Even with the shortage I was able to find a single box of federal ammo for $12.99 at a niche gun store after a 45 minuet drive to the middle of nowhere. Still more expensive than what 9mm is typically sold for, but nowhere near the $20-35 a box I’m seeing on this website."
2021-05-27 11:57:40,wallstreetbets,Okay but who’s paying 41cpr for steel 9mm?  Available but still obscenely priced

2021-05-27 19:57:36,wallstreetbets,This
2021-05-27 11:45:42,wallstreetbets,So?  Get back in.
2021-05-27 11:47:03,wallstreetbets,I’m just playing with options at this point
2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cassava Sciences | Finally a cure for AD? [Cassava Sciences](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/1/1nCATL9Q.png) is developing an Alzheimer drug, which not just slow the disease, but reverses it! In February they announced some incredible data for their 6-month open label study. That was the reason for the massive price increase. After that, the share price started declining due to some uncertainty. But a few weeks ago they announced to present the 9-month data set on a huge scientific conference in July.

For me that's a very very positive signal! Just imagine - would you present a failure on such a big stage? Certainly NO! Personally I used this opportunity to buy more shares.

The anticipation of the data release has already started but I am still adding below 60$. The CEO already spreaded some excitement about the data. He didn't want to ""spill the beans yet"", since Cassava is not allowed to publish the new study data before the conference. 

I am actually super bullish on this and can't wait to see the new data. 

&#x200B;

**My price target per share is > 400$**

2021-05-27 10:59:04,wallstreetbets,"Been holding it since $4 in 2020. It’s a roller coaster, not sure it’s fair value is $60, but we’ll see."
2021-05-27 11:01:30,wallstreetbets,I am also in since 2019 at 5$. The fair value will be beyond 400$ if the study data show some further improvement.
2021-05-27 11:59:25,wallstreetbets,"I have high hopes for Sava too, didn’t get in low like you but I’m still up nicely.  I also agree they wouldn’t have accepted the invitation to the conference to present bad data.  It has to be on par with the 6 month or better for them to go up on a world wide stage.

I’m seeing 80-100 after the conference and 250+ after the 12 months data."
2021-05-27 13:18:07,wallstreetbets,Hope this works. Dealing with family member with AD and it is brutal to deal with.
2021-05-27 14:25:48,wallstreetbets,SAVA has developed a drug WORSE than Aricept... Please rethink your journey. ANAVEX-73 look into it
2021-05-27 15:37:04,wallstreetbets,I still cry to this day today when i see this ticker 😭😭😭
2021-05-27 16:07:37,wallstreetbets,"Ahh.. I remember SAVA when it was around 8, I thought of buying.  I heard about SAVA on a IBRX conversation board.  The person on the board was big into SAVA.  Then they had prelim data come out and the stock opened in the 2's.  I thought of buying too but the price seemed too cheap then.  The person is doing quite well now on SAVA.  IBRX will get to where SAVA is tho."
2021-05-27 15:34:47,wallstreetbets,I am a scientist and know what this research means
2021-05-27 14:35:56,wallstreetbets,I totally agree with you! I guess we will see 60-80$ even before the conference
2021-05-27 14:37:15,wallstreetbets,I really spend a lot of time comparing all AD drugs which are currently being developed. IMHO Sava has the best product with the best chance to succeed
2021-05-27 14:40:22,wallstreetbets,Do you have any research experience or are you just reading documents you don't understand?
2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,GME Covered Calls sold yesterday (Friday Expiry) 
2021-05-27 10:52:34,wallstreetbets,Option traders r fucked
2021-05-27 11:41:38,wallstreetbets,That might hurt later lol
2021-05-27 10:59:27,wallstreetbets,Are you saying buy more GME?
2021-05-27 17:22:53,wallstreetbets,What 🦍 buys this?
2021-05-27 10:49:40,wallstreetbets,You’re down bad
2021-05-27 11:46:07,wallstreetbets,Position is closed now. Theta did me well enough over this amount of time. Not worth holding the shares until the calls expiration lol. I’m almost 100% certain GME starts to bleed out from here.
2021-05-27 11:07:17,wallstreetbets,You can do whatever you like. If it gets to the point of being ITM I’m not gonna be upset by missing out on some potential gains. But realistically that will not be happening
2021-05-27 17:26:37,wallstreetbets,I genuinely do not know why anyone would buy them 😂
2021-05-27 11:25:01,wallstreetbets,Theta decay accelerates exponentially today and tomorrow. He's likely going to be green by market open.
2021-05-27 10:56:17,wallstreetbets,"I just don’t want to get completely f’d again sorry. I lost over $5,000 on GME because I bought at the top earlier this year. This is my payback lmao. I’ve made it all back and some, so I’m not down bad. The bag holders will be down bad when GME tanks again though 😂"
2021-05-27 11:53:09,wallstreetbets,I'd love to see it stay above $230 for a week lmao
2021-05-27 13:51:05,wallstreetbets,It’s closed !? Well done and fuck you!
2021-05-27 11:42:25,wallstreetbets,"I think he was talking about what would happen if the underlying moves down in price drastically. I don’t think he doubts the calls will expire worthless. But any profit on them would be outweighed by the losses. I just closed my position a few minutes ago because of that exact reason. I’ll take the extra $3,000 and consider this a win. Not quite the $5,000+ max profit on the calls but much better than holding 1,100 shares when GME inevitably plummets again. He’s not wrong about GME on Friday’s either"
2021-05-27 11:26:18,wallstreetbets,That’s not the point to why I said this at all
2021-05-27 10:59:14,wallstreetbets,Boo
2021-05-27 11:00:26,wallstreetbets,You hope that goes itm and let it get called away.
2021-05-27 10:59:28,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t ask for you life story. This is your first post and you’re excited. I get it. We all made money and all lost money. Just don’t count your chickens before they hatch. Take wisdom moving forward, and take what you can. Not financial advice, but GME tends to come for blood in the water. And shit bleeds on fridays for GME."
2021-05-27 11:57:51,wallstreetbets,I think I’d be willing to put my life savings on that not happening lol
2021-05-27 13:06:04,wallstreetbets,I like you more and more I get to read your comments lol
2021-05-27 11:04:24,wallstreetbets,"Well sure, but I’m trying to be realistic here lmfao. I don’t think there’s any chance in hell it goes ITM by tomorrow."
2021-05-27 12:57:23,wallstreetbets,Lots of fake douche canoes don't believe everything you read
2021-05-27 11:03:02,wallstreetbets,"I’m ready to close my position and take profit whenever. No need to worry, I appreciate the not financial advice advice though."
2021-05-27 11:59:18,wallstreetbets,Better yours than mine! 😂😂😂
2021-05-27 19:10:44,wallstreetbets,It may it it pulls a 30% day.

2021-05-27 10:42:22,wallstreetbets,"Avg price was $8 (exercised some contracts instead of taking 11k profit!)
Went down to $5.61 via me changing from RH to Webull"
2021-05-27 12:59:50,wallstreetbets,"Your tittle is a bit misleading, cus it feels like you thought the squeeze went down and that you sold your position."

2021-05-27 14:26:02,wallstreetbets,"I'd cash out with your $7k+ profit (at time of comment, well played!) and call it what it is, a good day gambling. At least bank that profit as it starts to drop"

2021-05-27 11:15:42,wallstreetbets,"I beg you— please, please get off RH. Some anecdotal evidence: I’m Bulgarian. I’m a year younger than ya boi Vlad.

2021-05-27 11:31:11,wallstreetbets,if you only have $25k in life savings you should seriously consider using that to learn a trade or get a degree instead of betting it on stocks.

2021-05-27 17:00:17,wallstreetbets,"I invested a bunch in AMC during the first wave and ended up in the red. I decided to wait until the stock steadily climbed back up so I could sell later and get my money back.

I’m glad I stuck around. Even decided to dump another few thousand into the stock. Now I’ve already made $2000."
2021-05-27 17:22:13,wallstreetbets,best leave RH
2021-05-27 17:26:07,wallstreetbets,Robinhood is retarded.

I have an IRA account 99.5% of my money is in a broad ETF, 0.5% of my money is in AMC:

Today I made $6 more on AMC than on my ETF!"

2021-05-27 15:46:25,wallstreetbets,"Good luck to AMC holders.  Traded it for a mere $15 bucks today.  I'm partial to AMC since I enjoy the experience of actually going to movie theaters in person.  I think with squeezes maybe it goes to pre-pandemic highs of 2017.  Due to the large float, I doubt it can reach GME type prices.  I'm long on IBRX tho, important pancreatic cancer trial announcement to be made June 4th."
2021-05-27 11:05:49,wallstreetbets,Good work 👏
2021-05-27 11:07:49,wallstreetbets,This is the way.

2021-05-27 14:44:00,wallstreetbets,"The squeeze has not even begun, so anyone saying good luck at that price etc... makes no sense. We are still on the ground.. imagine buying at $1,000 and selling at 100k ? Uh, you still won. LFG"
2021-05-27 14:45:00,wallstreetbets,"Where are the Chats, WHO you are speaking for next time. Please. I'm a big Fan"

2021-05-27 15:22:01,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations, you have made a good decision"
2021-05-27 15:22:31,wallstreetbets,Where we go we don’t need luck. We just need some time for hedge to give in 😂😂💎💎💎
2021-05-27 15:22:55,wallstreetbets,Just sold all of my WKHS and bought AMC. I hope I did the right thing.🙏
2021-05-27 15:25:33,wallstreetbets,Better In GME
2021-05-27 15:25:43,wallstreetbets,Risky Idont think this is gonna do what GameStop did this would have been a good investment couple months ago when it was at 6 a share
2021-05-27 15:26:39,wallstreetbets,Bout time

2021-05-27 15:44:38,wallstreetbets,Hold strong apes this is just the beginning AMC to 1000k an beyond apes strong together you will regret selling
2021-05-27 15:45:52,wallstreetbets,Thinking about getting some AMC T-shirt’s made should be about $ 15-20 dollars each. I feel like as this is going to go down in history it would be sick if we all had a T-shirt we could all wear when SMC hits 500 k. At this point we all share it on social media and tag every single hedge fund and manager that has fucked with peoples dollar in the past.  Give them a few nice notifications 😂 if this sounds like something people wanna get involved in let me know 😂🤷‍♂️
2021-05-27 15:46:49,wallstreetbets,When does the squeeze take place ?
2021-05-27 15:47:30,wallstreetbets,good luck retard

2021-05-27 16:06:02,wallstreetbets,Been holding since $2.91 I don’t think there’s a purpose for me to sell cause the only way to go is up... but I’m poor so I can’t sell till it hits triple digits
2021-05-27 16:10:16,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck are people talking about average costs? The whole DD of this movement is based on numbers far greater than that so who cares.
2021-05-27 16:12:18,wallstreetbets,AMC all day!!! Let’s go!

2021-05-27 19:19:48,wallstreetbets,"1 advice is GTFO of Robin Hood.

2021-05-27 11:10:23,wallstreetbets,"Guys if you have TD Ameritrade you can request a fund withdrawal out of Robinhood, it will take about 3-4 days. simple"
2021-05-27 17:32:56,wallstreetbets,"It is all about valuation, very sad to see so many people not understanding anything about how things works in the market, a bankrupt company with 5 billion in debt, little revenue and negative profit (and no plan) cannot have a valuation that it has now, it might go up with the hype but it cannot last long, just trying to save some people. Take your profits and run. :)"
2021-05-27 17:55:18,wallstreetbets,I sold when it hit $14
2021-05-27 10:55:41,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 30 days

2021-05-27 11:15:44,wallstreetbets,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)
2021-05-27 13:53:28,wallstreetbets,I'll never understand the people who decide to throw their entire life savings into something after it has already gone up 115%. Why not the week before?
2021-05-27 14:13:29,wallstreetbets,Hold that bishhh 🦾💎🙌🦍🦍🦧🦧

2021-05-27 18:33:49,wallstreetbets,I have no idea about any of this. I missed my chance with gme but I’m not missing out on fucking over hedge fund assholes this time. In a coles note version. What’s this short squeeze timeline? Is this like a 3-6 months type of thing or should I be having my phone on me at all times with my volume up and notifications on scenario?
2021-05-27 17:44:04,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you 😁
2021-05-27 18:17:07,wallstreetbets,"You forgot you had $1500 in stocks??

Man wish I had that kind of money."
2021-05-27 18:48:55,wallstreetbets,"Same. I did not buy in at $3, but I randomly logged in to see a nice surprise in my investment account."
2021-05-27 19:43:51,wallstreetbets,"There is a 5 in the number of shares I have, but one less 0 on the end, haha. I went heavy on GME and put a bit in AMC."
2021-05-27 19:18:42,wallstreetbets,Same! I have a couple hundred and completely forgot until this morning!
2021-05-27 15:47:06,wallstreetbets,I could not give a single reason why I’ve been holding AMC this whole time but I’m suddenly glad I did

2021-05-27 17:37:56,wallstreetbets,average cost 6$ 💪 just wish i invested more than only 100.
2021-05-27 13:58:26,wallstreetbets,"avg cost of $27 here, I don't care, still think it's cheap"
2021-05-27 11:30:02,wallstreetbets,Glad I can lift your confidence. Don't compare with others no one is the same
2021-05-27 16:15:40,wallstreetbets,Lol that’s what mine is but I just have one 😔 but here’s to 100K $AMC

2021-05-27 19:23:26,wallstreetbets,Mine is $8.  I’ve been selling in portions as it rises.  Gonna sell 7 more at $30 and hold the remaining 10 shares.
2021-05-27 13:02:34,wallstreetbets,Welp... When wallstreetbets starts posting pics like this i guess that means it's my cue to sell and put my gains into gme
2021-05-27 12:36:17,wallstreetbets,more like 1 million times of warning
2021-05-27 13:22:37,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity is they way!

(add more ways under this thread my fellow apes.)"
2021-05-27 12:32:15,wallstreetbets,Geezus what an ape 🦍
2021-05-27 16:38:34,wallstreetbets,"Fuck Robinhood! CEO apologizes and says it’s oversight that stopped the GameStop buy. Go FUCK your self. That’s shady ass business practices and I would have pulled all my god damn money from their platform. If an investor on Robinhood wanted to drop a $mil, they wouldn’t have stopped that shit. I use* Fidelity right now and I love it. I got all my retirement and then my “fun” stocks too."
2021-05-27 16:37:00,wallstreetbets,RH will fuck em up again lol
2021-05-27 13:59:53,wallstreetbets,I have my doge on robinhood before all the bad shit that happened with them and you cant transfer crypto it pains me.
2021-05-27 15:00:16,wallstreetbets,I’m not worried about selling or buying because I’m not fuckin leavin
2021-05-27 14:39:10,wallstreetbets,"What's a better alternative?  I know Robin hood is shit, but I am worried about using another shit service.  And how does one transfer what we have at Robin hood without selling?"
2021-05-27 17:09:09,wallstreetbets,These idiots on rh I’m baffled
2021-05-27 18:43:56,wallstreetbets,Glad this is the top comment.
2021-05-27 11:16:09,wallstreetbets,No fucking way!! They block you from selling?
2021-05-27 14:11:37,wallstreetbets,that is actually true man move to fidelity !
2021-05-27 13:33:16,wallstreetbets,yeah and so did every other brokerage under the fucking sun. but your idiotic ape ass can’t read that much
2021-05-27 14:23:47,wallstreetbets,Every app brokerage did though
2021-05-27 13:36:27,wallstreetbets,I've had mine in robinhood since it all started if I transfer to.fidelity will they do it smoothly or steal.my stocks
2021-05-27 17:30:08,wallstreetbets,1k? Try at least that daily for the past 6 months.
2021-05-27 19:28:38,wallstreetbets,Probably the same reason he is m yoloing in AMC
2021-05-27 13:15:56,wallstreetbets,Because it's easier to deal with small outages than move brokerages for 90% of people
2021-05-27 14:31:48,wallstreetbets,I’m just getting into investing I don’t use robinhood but what would u recommend rn I have just been using cashapp to start
2021-05-27 15:00:17,wallstreetbets,Why do they block you?
2021-05-27 14:12:57,wallstreetbets,If RH stops trading again we riot! They already had to talk in front of counsel so the heat and spot light is already on them🦍💎
2021-05-27 15:56:56,wallstreetbets,whats going on with robinhood? I heard about them doing shady shit but idk what they actually did
2021-05-27 16:10:15,wallstreetbets,I started a year ago knowing nothing on cashapp stocks... what’s that gonna look like?
2021-05-27 19:49:58,wallstreetbets,What else is there? Newbie here
2021-05-27 15:32:50,wallstreetbets,ppl with paper hands shouldnt get them wet
2021-05-27 19:48:40,wallstreetbets,"Thats what happened to me. I bought at 8, watched it go up to 15 and drop to 13 so i sold it at 13 right, and now its at 26. Fml!"
2021-05-27 17:05:37,wallstreetbets,I hope the jack-ass who said Pluto can't be a planet is short AMC
2021-05-27 18:07:50,wallstreetbets,See you there
2021-05-27 11:29:35,wallstreetbets,what's the reason behind the big AMC jump? Haven't really been keeping up so I'm curious as to why AMC and GME are resurging again.
2021-05-27 12:08:23,wallstreetbets,His girlfriend’s boyfriend needed a bit of time to come up with the money
2021-05-27 11:09:46,wallstreetbets,I didn't have the money.
2021-05-27 11:45:04,wallstreetbets,So whats the next squeeze after gme and amc then so I can get on now?
2021-05-27 12:01:15,wallstreetbets,I'm in around $9 which I was thinking buying at the top last time around so maybe this guy (OP) gets it
2021-05-27 11:29:48,wallstreetbets,that's the wsb way
2021-05-27 12:57:54,wallstreetbets,"Someone has to hold the bag eventually, we should thank OP for his sacrifice"
2021-05-27 17:37:14,wallstreetbets,Buy high sell low and fuck fundamentals
2021-05-27 14:10:59,wallstreetbets,doesnt look like such a bad entry point right about now
2021-05-27 12:53:35,wallstreetbets,He's already gained $6000 in value in this time
2021-05-27 13:16:34,wallstreetbets,Lol. And they’ve already made nearly $7 a share.
2021-05-27 12:14:48,wallstreetbets,Well at least it’s less than $20 😂
2021-05-27 12:53:51,wallstreetbets,Its called FOMO. Glue eating retards have been into amc since $4. If you didn't believe it in it then at 4 fucking dollars why the fuck are you risking your money now
2021-05-27 11:21:18,wallstreetbets,This tbh. Basically jumping in at the top.
2021-05-27 17:33:00,wallstreetbets,"I see you and those posting. It feels like a solid ass trap. Not saying sell, not saying set limits, not saying anything. Just leave with more than you came with. I did it, it feels good. Could of had triple. Satisfied with what I walked out with. I don't like dealing with intangibles"
2021-05-27 18:18:53,wallstreetbets,"He's up 25%. With smart stop loss trades he can lock in gains. Seems fine to me, if he knows how to keep his wins."
2021-05-27 11:34:18,wallstreetbets,"Compared to the target(the moon), $14 and 25$ and 37$ and 142$ ...etc  all round to zero."
2021-05-27 15:31:56,wallstreetbets,expect some after hours shenanigans tonight
2021-05-27 15:08:58,wallstreetbets,"I bought most of my shares sub $5, wishing I was more retarded and yolod 25k"
2021-05-27 11:36:45,wallstreetbets,"Imagine thinking there's any real difference between $2 and $22 when this thing lands at $100,000 per share.

&#x200B;

If you bought in at $2, you made $999,998

If you bought in at $22, you made $999,978  


They're the same fucking number.  It all rounds to zero once we leave orbit.  They're fucked."
2021-05-27 15:07:40,wallstreetbets,"I bought at $9 sat on it for 4 months and sold at $15 then see it's nearing $30 today, oh well at least I made money but I think it's going to drop back to the teens after this squeeze."
2021-05-27 16:14:18,wallstreetbets,"I got it at about 9 just because,I wish I got more than 15, shares,but i was testing,and just held."
2021-05-27 17:45:29,wallstreetbets,I bought at $9.50 🚀
2021-05-27 11:33:45,wallstreetbets,i fucked myself I bough it at 10 when everyone said to then for like 2 months was just taking the biggest L so I traded options on it to make some money back....
2021-05-27 10:15:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah because RH is the problem, not the fact he has 100% of his portfolio in a meme stock."
2021-05-27 15:49:23,wallstreetbets,What share the link
2021-05-27 17:58:40,wallstreetbets,I agree....people be aware....
2021-05-27 18:44:55,wallstreetbets,"I disagree, the world is opening up and people will be at the movies a lot to catch up with life."
2021-05-27 11:04:06,wallstreetbets,Need enough to pay for my dogs surgery and living expenses for the next three months :(
2021-05-27 16:06:12,wallstreetbets,This is something I needed to hear lol. Thank you! Very curious to see what happens after the holiday weekend.
2021-05-27 14:24:11,wallstreetbets,Everyone is not supposed to believe that
2021-05-27 10:48:43,wallstreetbets,We got nothing to lose but money 🤑
2021-05-27 11:55:04,wallstreetbets,So basically what happens is the stock goes up then down a bit then back up then down a bit more then it goes up some more and then starts to go down a bit and if you are still reading this then just stop and buy more amc
2021-05-27 16:24:39,wallstreetbets,yes

2021-05-27 13:11:09,wallstreetbets,Why
2021-05-27 14:31:21,wallstreetbets,"Look at mr moneybags over here with $25,001 in his savings account"
2021-05-27 11:32:06,wallstreetbets,Got a degree in computer engineering / computer science. Debt free
2021-05-27 14:10:38,wallstreetbets,I’m 32 and I don’t even have 10k. Student Loans are a bitch.
2021-05-27 17:09:22,wallstreetbets,"So how many months worth of life do you have saved up, Mr. Moneybags?"

2021-05-27 12:19:25,wallstreetbets,You're only retarded if you accept it.
2021-05-27 13:58:35,wallstreetbets,Did you happen to read his average share price?  Nope.
2021-05-27 13:45:43,wallstreetbets,Because life's a risk. Also bank doesn't give me very good interest
2021-05-27 14:52:23,wallstreetbets,Subs called bets for a reason buddy
2021-05-27 17:45:55,wallstreetbets,Don’t let the FOMO stop you - we’re in this together!

2021-05-27 18:43:13,wallstreetbets,"No, only invest what you can afford to lose"
2021-05-27 10:34:09,wallstreetbets,"No he’s not late at all.   Could have had twice the tickets, but that’s ok.   8% in one day?   That’s traditionally a year’s worth of index gains.   You rock on!"
2021-05-27 10:31:45,wallstreetbets,😭😭😭 tell me about it.
2021-05-27 11:54:38,wallstreetbets,there's a fee for that if i recall

2021-05-27 17:50:12,wallstreetbets,This is when I should have gone in! Whatever $9 is still good!
2021-05-27 16:04:24,wallstreetbets,"We're so much dumber than they realize.  Their models are off by orders of magnitude.    


I'm infinitely more retarded than any coefficient can properly capture."
2021-05-27 16:33:51,wallstreetbets,It’s funny cause I actually asked my mom yesterday if I should sell my amc… happy she ignored me 😂😂
2021-05-27 16:15:51,wallstreetbets,"I had to go look and was kind of surprised how low my average cost was.

Time flies."

2021-05-27 18:49:21,wallstreetbets,Been holding 70 shares bought at $9 in feelin like a champ now
2021-05-27 19:53:14,wallstreetbets,Lol I've been holing for a while. I bought in at 8.50 and bought more at 13.46. Now my average is 10.77.. was a good day. Lol holding on for this rocket 🚀
2021-05-27 17:54:01,wallstreetbets,You hot in at a great price. I bought my first 175 shares at $14 and it dropped the next couple days to $5.50 but I was afraid to buy more lol. First timer. Panicked when it dropped but held on.
2021-05-27 19:32:02,wallstreetbets,"Bought at 2,33$ but I had no more money left and now it's making me crazy."
2021-05-27 19:35:06,wallstreetbets,"5 dollars, I own a whole 2 shares =D"
2021-05-27 17:00:17,wallstreetbets,Definitely! Wait until you see the price is in its triple digits!
2021-05-27 17:03:45,wallstreetbets,Definitely. Undervalued. At a discount rn. The squeeze hasn't even started.
2021-05-27 16:05:56,wallstreetbets,I like this stock.
2021-05-27 11:31:00,wallstreetbets,much luck to u nd ur investing journey
2021-05-27 15:25:25,wallstreetbets,😱😱😱
2021-05-27 15:32:28,wallstreetbets,"Same, thought it was way too undervalued at the time"
2021-05-27 14:16:51,wallstreetbets,am I going to learn my lesson from last time? prolly not
2021-05-27 16:15:58,wallstreetbets,"Why the fuck would you do that? They're linked. GME Goes up, AMC goes up."
2021-05-27 16:11:15,wallstreetbets,I just sold everything and dumped to amc. Was a xx holder now am xxxx
2021-05-27 19:56:30,wallstreetbets,"Excellent. If the rest of you would kindly do that tomorrow morning, GME can have a +35% Friday, too, and we all spend Memorial Day weekend banging coke and snorting hookers. 

Note: Just humor, I'm not giving financial advice or attempting to manipulate the market. No one listens to me anyway. Sadly, they listen to CNBC and Bloomberg."
2021-05-27 15:19:39,wallstreetbets,smart man
2021-05-27 17:48:24,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. Tread carefully friend, I find it hard to believe they stalled GME and let AMC moonshot for no reason.

It may keep going up tmmrw, but I'd be wary for a sudden bottom out on the price."
2021-05-27 16:29:13,wallstreetbets,pussy bitch
2021-05-27 17:37:38,wallstreetbets,well besides the GME part you were on the right track
2021-05-27 17:02:12,wallstreetbets,Exactly

2021-05-27 14:43:38,wallstreetbets,Is it safe to transfer now since we have until the end of june to see if we get anything from this vote?
2021-05-27 18:16:20,wallstreetbets,Why fidelity > ameritrade ?
2021-05-27 16:04:14,wallstreetbets,Anyone use WeBull??
2021-05-27 11:19:06,wallstreetbets,If this isn't sarcasm then where have you been
2021-05-27 12:22:03,wallstreetbets,"Incase you aren’t being sarcastic. Yes, RH blocked you from buying GME during the first huge GME squeeze. They completely killed the momentum and stopped GME from who knows how much higher it could have gone"
2021-05-27 12:37:33,wallstreetbets,What’s an exit strategy?
2021-05-27 12:28:56,wallstreetbets,Transfer to fidelity NOW. You deserve what’s coming if you stay on RH.

2021-05-27 13:05:17,wallstreetbets,Bro that was the past your good. Don’t transfer out now the stock is hot and you need to watch it and put a stop loss so you don’t lose your savings
2021-05-27 12:50:12,wallstreetbets,Are you...are you actually...retarded?
2021-05-27 13:07:24,wallstreetbets,"Don’t listen to these fools, majority of them haven’t even been affected by Robin Hood’s halt of buying shares last January. If you try and transfer out on a holiday weekend your looking at 10 days before they transfer and in the mean time you won’t be able to sell"
2021-05-27 14:08:49,wallstreetbets,"Only the app based brokerages like Robinhood and WeBull did. None of the Vanguard, Schwab, or Fidelity blocked buying. At most those brokerages limited margin trading on these stocks which is pretty reasonable tbh. Go get yourself a big boy brokerage."
2021-05-27 14:09:10,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure fidelity didn’t block anyone.

2021-05-27 17:29:34,wallstreetbets,I bought some amc stock because i expected it to go up once covid restrictions loosen up. Funny how it works.
2021-05-27 19:36:00,wallstreetbets,Same thing driving GME. Large short interest and retail investors hunting hedge funds.
2021-05-27 11:37:02,wallstreetbets,Short squeeze.
2021-05-27 11:29:07,wallstreetbets,You got $25k in that short amount of time?
2021-05-27 11:13:33,wallstreetbets,that's a good reason.

2021-05-27 11:54:42,wallstreetbets,You are unironically delusional if you think AMC is going remotely near that price.
2021-05-27 11:57:17,wallstreetbets,Are you shitting me?
2021-05-27 11:57:37,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow ape

I too can't do the maths

&#x200B;

But just in case we are trying to get close to the truth.  The difference in $20 of 1,219.8 shares is closer to $25,000 than your presented scenario.  Which is like the cost of a 20 acres to start wsb HF on."
2021-05-27 15:50:38,wallstreetbets,"probably going to correct back to $19 here shortly, but I also got in at $9 so woooo rocket ride"

2021-05-27 11:57:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes ,75$ but worth it when RH is shut down"
2021-05-27 13:47:31,wallstreetbets,"Lol its really not though. Investing is long term and far from a gamble, playing around with a stock that should have fallen because one man told them to invest in companies like gme and amc ect saving these rightfully fallen companies and that is gonna make them rich of they all invest is gambling at that point.

A real investment that you actually put the time and effort into researching knowing the gains you can make long term is not gambling. 

How many people here actually really truly invested in stocks for the long term.......and for the right reason to invest."

2021-05-27 18:23:05,wallstreetbets,Or ... its been literally 3 days since your average cost could be considered high :P
2021-05-27 17:16:16,wallstreetbets,got 30 shares when it was below 10$. now im wishing i had more
2021-05-27 19:59:38,wallstreetbets,This is the way! Planet of Apes.
2021-05-27 18:09:00,wallstreetbets,I'm in at 9.84 but I sold off half at 15ish a little while back. Now I'm kinda mad. I couldve used those to help cancel out the fact that my GME average is 211 since I didn't buy the dip in the 40s 😒
2021-05-27 19:30:01,wallstreetbets,"You're better then me, I dumped mine. I'm so stupid 🙄"
2021-05-27 18:19:18,wallstreetbets,Keep this coming! I already feel like an ape for being in for 40 @ $15. The more digies the better.
2021-05-27 18:09:09,wallstreetbets,I like fat hairy balls in my mouth
2021-05-27 12:16:27,wallstreetbets,No one will give a single shit about their cost average when this squeezes..
2021-05-27 15:26:26,wallstreetbets,"Some of you idiots didnt listen to those of us who just said. ""It will go up bc Hollywood needs AMC"" and here yall are"
2021-05-27 15:34:27,wallstreetbets,I honeslty dont understand the whole short squeeze hype but $AMC $15 end of year :)
2021-05-27 15:40:31,wallstreetbets,Same boat I’ve held so long feels a shame to sell now 😂
2021-05-27 16:42:47,wallstreetbets,"I thought that also, but last couple of days, not so much.  AMC was up, GME down."
2021-05-27 16:52:39,wallstreetbets,This is the new floor!
2021-05-27 14:42:35,wallstreetbets,"FWIW I started my partial transfer (just GME bc I'm holding some 🅱️rypto) at like 1 a.m. Wednesday morning, and it was completed by around 9:30P.M. that night."
2021-05-27 14:45:05,wallstreetbets,"Just a heads up, I initiated my transfer on May 7th with an estimated completion of May 17th, and it still hasn’t completed."
2021-05-27 13:42:07,wallstreetbets,It can take 5-7 business days to transfer... So if the SHTF you can't do anything... Best to wait when things are calm.
2021-05-27 17:14:12,wallstreetbets,Took me 2 days when I did it a month or 2 ago. Just make sure you “downgrade” your Rh account to cash from margin beforehand
2021-05-27 16:39:47,wallstreetbets,"I would start the transfer mine took like 2 days, and it's better to be stuck than lose everything from Robinhood"
2021-05-27 13:47:26,wallstreetbets,"Yes the squeeze will last long enough even if it starts before the transfer is complete EDIT: idk why people are downvoting but again yeah, you have plenty of time"
2021-05-27 17:05:39,wallstreetbets,I wanna move my gme from RH to fidelity too but damn feels like ima miss out of n something while I’m waiting 😂
2021-05-27 16:41:24,wallstreetbets,Took me 2 days to transfer out
2021-05-27 16:04:09,wallstreetbets,It's a gamble now dude. If it moons while you're in the process of transferring you won't be able to sell any of your shares. Hope RH doesn't screw over their holders this time around.
2021-05-27 11:25:17,wallstreetbets,They’ve never blocked selling. Just buying.
2021-05-27 13:07:02,wallstreetbets,"I've had such a hard time with fidelity. Been trying to transfer from RH to fidelity for over a month but they locked my account for some reason and their customer service can't seem to find out why they locked it. 

I've missed out on for sure gains now cause of it. Those bastards. I'd try another broker but I had put in 2k into fidelity cause I wanted in on the dkng dip, but how nice that after I put in 2k my account gets frozen."
2021-05-27 12:47:41,wallstreetbets,Is there an easy way to transfer your stocks from RH to fidelity without selling your current positions?
2021-05-27 13:13:52,wallstreetbets,"Unless they've changed, Fidelity cock blocks selling shares with major price fluctuations to ""protect"" you from selling if your shares value changes more than XX% or some shit like that.  That includes if your shares skyrocket and you want to paper hands that bitch."
2021-05-27 13:13:01,wallstreetbets,Nobody “deserves” it. But yes they should definitely get out. Some new apes weren’t around then and don’t know any better
2021-05-27 14:12:55,wallstreetbets,"oh really? because i remember TD Ameritrade was literally the first one to do it. I got the marketwatch update for it saying TD did the day before the others did, and i saw it for myself. and schwab did too. but ig ICount6shots (stupid fucking ape ass name) knows better than the news companies that reported on it"
2021-05-27 17:28:21,wallstreetbets,"So this is the same GME argument from 5 months ago and you’re saying hedge funds with billions Of AUM are just torching their money away trying to short instead of closing their positions... you know they are reviewed by quarterly performances... they are always actively managing their assets, their bonuses come from performance so id bank on hedge funds buying a shit ton of calls, propping up the price and then making bank on the calls and then shorting the top (just my theory). I understand the first time retail caught them off guard but now??? You know the saying... fool me once..."

2021-05-27 16:06:23,wallstreetbets,"Basically a bunch of hedge funds were shorting AMC, but it looked like it was going to make it. So when we keep buying shares we're making their short losses bigger and bigger.

2021-05-27 12:49:14,wallstreetbets,"Yes, sign up with fidelity and initiate a partial transfer from them. It should take about a day to no more than a week from what others have mentioned, since RH doesn’t actually own your shares, they’ll be trying to buy it from the market before transferring to fidelity."

\-Short selling is bad, reddit is good, stick it to the man, buy and hold.

\-Short selling is aiight, but some of these shady mother fuckers are about to get caught cheating, and when that happens, tendies rain from the sky.

If you believe in the second theory, you still have to hedge your bet based on whether or not you trust the SEC to do the right thing and investigate their own family members, because it's a clusterfuck of corruption that goes straight to the core and we might melt the entire system, or at the very least, expose the fact that they're intentionally trying to crash the US $ by short selling bonds.  This is so much bigger than GME or AMC.  These are just the first steps in a very large explosion.

https://imgur.com/a/BiZSIJA

I really really like the setup on this one as it's broken out of the weekly downward trend line and has found support over 15 a share. I bought options that go until Jan of 2022 to hopefully give me enough time for the weed stock hype to come back before the spring legislative session of 2022 in which I expect Congress to pass their federal legalization bill. I could get lucky and it might be introduced this summer which would be ideal. But even if not the chart and price action suggests to me that $20 a share is completely possible even without legislative catalyst.

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Peak into the future with Draftkings   

Morning everyone. This post is by no way detailed with statistics or a deep dive into the company, this is just something I have been watching over the past 6 months as a very active social media user. Draftkings has 3-4 active Twitter accounts. The main one of coarse being simply @ Draftkings with 320K folowers (@ Fanduel only has 254k but who is keeping score) . Anyway, as Draftkings rolls out new programs like Sports Betting (@ DKSportsbook) or Casino (@ DKCasino) and you can get a pretty good idea of what the company will be doing or acting like by simply scrolling down their feed.

Well if you have a minute, I suggest you scroll down the Twitter feed of @ DKCasino. They only have 200 posts or so since they are relatively new but you can see that when they started posting late last year, and literally only being live in a handful of states, they had free money promotions with almost no interaction. But now, especially the past month or so, you will notice every one of their tweets is now 

1) a direct advertisement of one of their games that you can currently play

2)a sign up promotion 

3) interactions with a player who has won money. 

4) starting to have 30+ comments on every tweet. 

I think #3 is the key to the future. When investing in Draftkings everyone including myself constantly thinks ""Sports betting"" which we can all agree is a young mans/woman's game. Very few, including myself, have realized that Draftkings will be using all its power of brand name, player connection and social media to delivery a full LEGAL casino to your iPhone. The last sentence is simply fact, as I stated @ Draftkings twitter account has 320K followers, the @ DKCasino only has..... 2607 followers. YUP, thats IT, only TWO THOUSAND followers so far. I think this is a huge reason institutional investors like Blackrock or ARK are going in head first. They are buying a fully legal casino delivered to your door. You know those busses they run out of retirement homes into Casinos and back 3 times a week? Well why on earth would those old people spend hours on busses when the future of Casinos is a Draftkings app on a 24 inch Ipad screen in their rooms? 

Now you say "" Hey buddy, what does Draftkings know about casinos when they will be competing with PENN or MGM or WYNN. And in a sense you are right. But for a second, lets look at that retirement home scenario. Draftkings has NO brick and mortar casinos. Unlike PENN or MGM. Who benefits more from your grandmother NOT taking the free shuttle bus to the brick Casino, PENN/MGM who make money either way, or Draftkings who spends 0.0 $ on storefronts, employees, and every penny that Grandma spends playing in her room is 100% PURE profit taken away from PENN or MGM. 

Everyone keeps focusing on the amount of money Draftkings has spent on customer acquisition lately. That is the reason the stock price is down. Well if you think of them acquiring future Casino customers that they are taking away from PENN, MGM and WYNN. It makes more sense of why they are spending so hard."

2021-05-27 09:49:55,wallstreetbets,"before COVID maybe. The future or at least the next few years is living with COVID. Which means vaccinations... how long are they good for, 6 months, 9 months, when is the booster shot... are you protected the same 6 months after shot as you are 14 days after? So many questions, so many risks. 40-50 year who are paying thousands for their parents to be in these homes, will not want mom and dad sitting in a dirty filthy bus with 60 other people just for a ""free buffet"""
2021-05-27 09:47:11,wallstreetbets,I agree all three companies have value. PENN has Barstool and MGM has EVERYTHING. However that everything comes with a huge price. DKNG does not have that cost to do the same business... if they can achieve it with the Casino business its simply a free addition to the sports betting they are aiming for.

2021-05-27 14:14:23,wallstreetbets,"There aren't ""grounded people"".  At least not vocally, some people are definitely saying they're bullish but they're swing trading or making a killing on CC's.  The bet is that enough people believe in the 10M to keep buying their shares for higher and higher.  Once that stops... it stalls or goes down.  It can't go up infinitely without new blood.

IMO the evidence points towards the squeeze potential going down significantly although there is still some naked shorting going on clearly with the FTDs.  My bet doesn't require a ""no squeeze"" it requires a ""no forever squeeze""."

2021-05-27 10:05:17,wallstreetbets,"I don't share the opinion that a vote recall will cause the price to go to $10M.  It might lead to another mini-squeeze but my bet incorporates that as a possibility hence June 25.

Going in on gamestop and amc because one man started this notion to stick it to the man is a gamble and its not investing in my eyes but gambling at this point and is steering alot of new investors into thinking they are a good stock to buy into and hold for the long term and it is most certainly not a good long term investment but a short term gamble."

2021-05-27 11:41:41,wallstreetbets,Of course if it tanks I'll do that.  But with spreads it's often not worth it to buy it back if it moves against you.  Unless there's a reason to think it can't ever go in your favor again.  Might even consider just rolling it further expiration (basically to a post-squeeze date) for more premium and profits if needed.

 My reply:



Some will not.  But IMO it is not realistic to make every single short in all of GME to cover.  I also don't share your opinion of the magnitude of naked shorting going on.  It would require an endless stream of new investors buying at higher and higher.

In any case, my bet has some squeeze potential baked into, hence 3 weeks after shareholder meeting (I might also consider rolling out the bet further in expiration for bigger gains which is another potential cushion).  I guess if it goes to $10M for an entire month, stays there, and the entire world descends into chaos I might lose my bet."
2021-05-27 17:18:28,wallstreetbets,"Not so much no squeeze.  More like mini-squeezes, not $10M.  That's why I put it into Jun 25th."

2021-05-27 12:04:51,wallstreetbets,"I mean it's a spread.  The losses are capped.  Also I have the option of rolling out to further expiration when premiums / gains are even higher (if price moves up).

The thing is, even if it goes high it can't stay up there if the only thing keeping it up is a squeeze."
2021-05-27 12:06:21,wallstreetbets,"Like generally speaking I think panic closing spreads is a bad idea.  You need to be comfortable with the risk and if it's set fairly high strike, ""let it play out."""

&#x200B;

LinkedIn is the biggest and baddest in the social networking professional space. Too bad $MSFT saw this years ago and decided to buy them, so knowing the true value is pretty hard. That being said, they're not the only fish in the sea, and yesterday one of those fish went public.

&#x200B;

ZipRecruiting $ZIP IPOd yesterday, and unlike $COIN didn't immediately shit the bed. It actually went up, weird right? Anyways, everyone and their dog is going to be looking for jobs now that covid is over and the stimulus checks dry up, so calls on $ZIP as their revenue shoots to the mooooooonnnn, especially after you all lose your ass on GME and AMC and even wendys wont hire you, so youll need to use these guys to find a job

They are two teenagers with a rare dwarfism condition.  They are both crazy popular in their own countries (one is in a music video).

They want to be MMA fighters, but can’t fight children....so they are fighting each other.

I don’t know if it is true.  Just watched this video, and it is amazing."

2021-05-27 11:06:23,wallstreetbets,Barstool Sports did an article on Hasbulla recently (little guy with red hat). First time I heard of him so I looked him up. Came across a Reddit post on r/Russia asking for more information on him. OP said he wanted to bring him to America to do some work. Barstool Sports also runs Rough N’ Rowdy (the best PPV for the money by the way). I would not be surprised if RNR tried to get Hasbulla.

Proportionate dwarfism

When the head, trunk, and limbs are all proportionate to each other, but much smaller than those of an average-sized person, the condition is known as proportionate dwarfism. This type of dwarfism is often the result of a hormone deficiency."

Speaking as a caucasian muslim, i would know. However i don’t rule out the fact that it could be due to the small gene pool in this population, nonetheless it isn’t “cousin fucking”."

But I don't actually know what they're speaking. I speak Persian, but I sometimes have a tough time understanding the accent of people from Tajikistan when they're speaking fast. The Tajik boy to my ears sounds like he's saying something in Persian at the very end of OP's clip.

Edit: he's definitely talking in Persian at the end of the clip"
2021-05-27 14:22:10,wallstreetbets,"Nope, Tajiks are an Iranic ethnic group. The three countries where Persian is spoken by a majority are Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.

Funnily enough, the name of the country means ""land of the non-turk people"" Tajik is the Old Turkic word for ""Non-turk"".

The word ""taj"" in Persian also means ""crown"", hence the crown on the flag, but this is false etymology."
2021-05-27 16:51:11,wallstreetbets,"They are mainly speaking in Russian, but they are not russians. At the end the guy in the right begins to talk in some other language. Taking into account that  “Tajikistan” word on his hat I assume it was Persian language."

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MVIS DD Just thinking out loud here, no advice found in this tread.

What a day yesterday, but as expected per my last DD. The question now is since MVIS is sub $15 - will the downward movement continue or will the stock stagnate around $15 for awhile?

Looking at the usual metrics, the only thing that can significantly answer this question is the placement of options for now. This is because:

https://preview.redd.it/61qdor9stn171.png?width=2228&format=png&auto=webp&s=01556f96df70c1f4293f70b4f707763e2594640d

There is reasonable protection from dealer gamma - but this can be a double-edged sword if it rises too quickly too much. But in this case, a marginal decrease with a significant price drop is a relatively good sign .

The price, despite its drop, ended about where it was expected to (at the lower band of expectation):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7oiku922un171.png?width=2192&format=png&auto=webp&s=72d134ddb771c880e75591ac8beab90417ac896a

https://preview.redd.it/u3elpj34un171.png?width=2120&format=png&auto=webp&s=df325eb5f5650313c6dac91446c37681c21f333c

https://preview.redd.it/xxfkrp55un171.png?width=2168&format=png&auto=webp&s=280b23f69b58e948fb500e0da0877a5e9677137a

The options landscape hasn't changed that much, relatively speaking. The price moved down below the largest chunk of calls at $15, again as expected.

So in attempting to divine the future, one must ask: are there any forces at play that are more significant than the others? The answer: currently - no, but the cliff is near.

Take a peak at these metrics:

https://preview.redd.it/022b4ildun171.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=3895f4fb62252b9f4e3b9a2a9949f025598675fe

These are the number of shares (assuming all dealer intermediary) that must be bought or sold per combination of price / IV increase.

MVIS is in the uncomfortable position where *any increase in IV will result in selling*. This is unusual and slightly unhealthy. 

So MVIS seems entirely contingent currently on liquidity: if it remains low, then it will probably waiver around $15 until big upstream moves are made. If IV begins to rise, than a cycle of selling could be initiated. Per the options, if this happens, the only 'floor' of sorts would be around $10 with the \~18k Puts.

Keep an eye on volatility!"
2021-05-27 11:20:59,wallstreetbets,My calls expire 6/11 hoping to see a spike and dump em tomorrow 🤞🏻
2021-05-27 10:01:23,wallstreetbets,"Ive been in mvis since last year. In all honesty i havent sold a single share throughout all the spikes. The weekly options put into play last week IMO has pushed out a spike that I think would've happened within the next week or two. MM have been keeping price between 13-15 to keep most of calls out of the money. Shorts can only go based on sentiment. There is no news now other than possible Russell index inclusion. Shareholder meeting yesterday showed clear direction. 

Fee borrow 36.3% with 85k shares available when typing this now its down to 7k available(40 cent drop). Dark pool still shows a negative balance. 

IMO I think mvis is bound to go up rather than down"

2021-05-27 09:03:14,wallstreetbets,Here for the 405
2021-05-27 10:50:55,wallstreetbets,Your posts are great. Thanks man. I look forward to reading these daily and they are paying off. Appreciate it man and keep it up!
2021-05-27 09:45:40,wallstreetbets,Another theta day it seems? Playing straddle?
2021-05-27 11:08:33,wallstreetbets,Seems like that 420.75 is really hard to break.
2021-05-27 11:12:01,wallstreetbets,Flirted with the resistance level to the upside
2021-05-27 11:16:55,wallstreetbets,I hope he gives the tax breaks he said he would.

2021-05-27 19:45:22,wallstreetbets,What do you think about the decrease in volume recently?
2021-05-27 09:15:37,wallstreetbets,Thanks friend :)
2021-05-27 09:02:48,wallstreetbets,God I hope so. Need that resistance break and we are in business for 422 IMO
2021-05-27 09:05:52,wallstreetbets,Maybe sell both because we flat
2021-05-27 09:05:44,wallstreetbets,Can I add this to the post? This is great info! ill give credit friend :)
2021-05-27 09:15:35,wallstreetbets,We are so fucked if inflation continues. With this debt based economy the fed has lost all ability to get it under control by increasing interest rates.
2021-05-27 09:06:48,wallstreetbets,👀
2021-05-27 13:56:36,wallstreetbets,When’s the news??
2021-05-27 11:12:42,wallstreetbets,What a coincidence that as soon as it approached it the Biden budget capital gains tax headline runs. Tanked everything...
2021-05-27 12:19:51,wallstreetbets,Thanks friend.
2021-05-27 15:55:44,wallstreetbets,I hope so. I'm bored out of my mind. At least FUBO playing out nicely :)
2021-05-27 19:55:05,wallstreetbets,It makes sense since volatility went into memes this week IMO. Make me clinch my butt hole though. Especially when we didn’t get a melt up and couldn’t break 421. Es1! Right now has me intrigued. If it keeps it up we will gap up tomorrow morning. We just need inflation numbers to be promising and we see ATH tomorrow IMO. But let’s see. Not financial advice.
2021-05-27 09:28:32,wallstreetbets,"Agreed.  We appreciate you, JJD!"

2021-05-27 11:25:08,wallstreetbets,at the exact same time..
2021-05-27 13:54:52,wallstreetbets,Was wondering if you had an opinion on why there's such low volume these past few days. I'm assuming it's the uncertainty of this breaking out or falling but from everything I'm looking at online volume should be growing as we are getting out of W setup
2021-05-27 09:41:21,wallstreetbets,Thanks friend :)
2021-05-27 09:16:12,wallstreetbets,Godspeed friend :)
2021-05-27 12:21:13,wallstreetbets,I think if we stay above 420 and remain flat we will gap up tomorrow morning IMO but let’s see 😀
2021-05-27 09:23:35,wallstreetbets,🙏 🧎
2021-05-27 09:25:40,wallstreetbets,Since the 80s we’ve increased this ratio by 3x is this not a concern? Genuine question. I wonder why the fed continues to hold down IRs while they say our economy is going to boom.
2021-05-27 17:15:08,wallstreetbets,"The last time debt/GDP was this high was WW2, followed shortly by 10-20% inflation.

Now factor in that 80% of Americans are in debt, the robust manufacturing industry that bailed us out is gone and the average P/E ratio is at the levels it was during the great depression and dot com bubble.

Thanks for proving my point."

2021-05-27 16:40:03,wallstreetbets,holy green dildo batman. Lets see if we gap up tomorrow :)
2021-05-27 18:07:08,wallstreetbets,"Yes that was insane!! I was able to sell VIX put 18 that expired June 2. Panic because I thought it expired this Friday and didn't want it to excerise.

2021-05-27 08:27:53,wallstreetbets,Kodak let my entire city down when they refused to go digital which in turn sank the company and thousands of jobs and pensions. Good luck!
2021-05-27 08:32:06,wallstreetbets,Wasn't Kodak a meme stock before GME?  Remember Kodak came up with Kodak Coin that appears to have failed.  GME going with NFT.  Kodak wanted to do ICO?
2021-05-27 08:59:25,wallstreetbets,Kodak sounds interesting from this post. I am going to take a look.
2021-05-27 08:23:00,wallstreetbets,But why? You expecting Biden to somehow have Kodak make some vaccine stuff?

2021-05-27 08:36:37,wallstreetbets,U spell gme amc wrong
2021-05-27 08:39:26,wallstreetbets,Just got the news that the Trump administration loaned Kodak some money.
2021-05-27 08:30:59,wallstreetbets,"Well Kodak is pretty iconic brand. That aside it has been underperforming for year's. The last Q1 results seemed to be a turning point for Kodak.

Market Cap: 550mil
Q1 revenue: 265mil
Q1 income: 6mill (compared to -111mil Q1 2020)
Cash on hand: 401mill

So historically Kodak has been on a loosing streak. But recently they have made the right moves the cut the fat, start generating profits while also strengthening their balance sheet with new investment.

Kodak has a few product lines, printers inks etc. While these generate most of Kodaks income they are also fairly stable. What is less known is kodaks history with advanced chemicals manufacturing and I expect this is where future growth will reside. 

So as it stands they are trading at 0.5x revs with almost their entire market cap in cash and making profit. That seems like a deep value play and gives them plenty of runway for growth. 

On top of that but not so important is that they have a 33% free float SI."
2021-05-27 09:44:59,wallstreetbets,"Yep my Dad was a lifer there luckily got made redundant just before he would have retired.

Unluckily then had to watch his pension being dicked about for years  - at least had the Pension Protection Fund as a fall back.

It's one stock I could never get behind."
2021-05-27 08:35:36,wallstreetbets,"I mean that was a long time ago! Business sometime make mistakes, in Kodaks case it was a bit of a whopping one. But the company seems to be turning a corner after year's of losing. Read some of my other comments in the thread."
2021-05-27 08:38:41,wallstreetbets,"It wasn't really a Meme it became a meme because last year trump announced a 765mil loan to kodak for pharma that never materialised for many reasons. Stock went from 2$ to 60$ and back very quickly. It became its own ""kodak moment"".

Nevertheless it is a company that has moved on and is continuing its own path meme or no meme. I would check out Q1 results, cash on hand and market cap. Tells a pretty good value / turnaround play story."
2021-05-27 08:40:16,wallstreetbets,Kodak was a quick meme because they got that loan that rocketed the security up from $2 to $35. It's been lame ever since.
2021-05-27 09:15:38,wallstreetbets,"Best things to look at are recent filings, Q1 results, capital raise, directors, insider buying and selling etc. All very bullish.

They recently raised about 200mil in notes that convert to stock at 14$ from large private investors. The current CEO is also heavily incentivised to convert those notes to stock. Keep in mind that 14$ would equate to roughly 1x revs market cap."
2021-05-27 08:32:15,wallstreetbets,"Nope not expecting anything from Biden or vaccines. Look at Q1 results, cash on hand and market cap. I think its a value play!"
2021-05-27 08:58:40,wallstreetbets,Thanks that's what I thought! There's more than 2 stocks in the market.

2021-05-27 08:33:40,wallstreetbets,"They had to strengthen their balance sheet to get to a profitable instead of losing position. Sadly that means some things must go! But check out Q1 results, cash on hand and market cap."

2021-05-27 08:42:45,wallstreetbets,Convert GME and AMC to binary then replay it in morse code! You will get Kodak 🤯
2021-05-27 08:49:53,wallstreetbets,Indeed
2021-05-27 09:06:01,wallstreetbets,There are actual reasons this particular company has a higher than average short interest…
2021-05-27 08:56:03,wallstreetbets,The saddest thing was they were the company that invented the digital sensor and showed the Japanese the future of imaging unfortunately they brass at Kodak cared about film production because it was a cash cow with all R&D paid for years ahead of time. They created their own downfall very ironic
2021-05-27 08:47:07,wallstreetbets,"I mean it was lame before then. But recent movements are showing that the trend is being reversed. Kodak is in a very strong financial situation right now with almost all it's market cap in cash 401mil (cap 550mil) and started to turn a profit on 265mil Q1 revs. 

Not saying it wasn't a mean, not saying it wasn't lame. But things change, kodak seems to be and right now looks like great value."

2021-05-27 08:42:14,wallstreetbets,That’s why it’s RED!! 😂

2021-05-27 10:18:50,wallstreetbets,buy your mom
2021-05-27 09:08:30,wallstreetbets,"I am not disagreeing they have been on a loosing streak for a long time. But they have been putting in the effort to turn the ship around. It seems they are on that path right now by the numbers and that's why I think it's a value play. 

The SI is immaterial to me, just thought it was worthy of note. It may have been warranted, that does not mean it still is."
2021-05-27 08:57:38,wallstreetbets,"Yes I agree, they could have been giants. But right now they are an underdog with lots of positive things going for them. Underdogs do always fight harder than incumbents."
2021-05-27 11:46:41,wallstreetbets,Let me know your thoughts.
2021-05-27 11:46:50,wallstreetbets,Let me know your thoughts.

2021-05-27 10:20:33,wallstreetbets,Your dad already did!
2021-05-27 09:11:30,wallstreetbets,"I’m generally all for the underdog, but after the extremely shitty actions by the executives in cahoots with the former administration, they can rot in hell for all I care. 

From a trader/investor perspective, I genuinely do not see the same thing you do regarding a turn around. You might be seeing what you want to see here. Anyways, I wouldn’t consider this a yolo worthy company."
2021-05-27 09:02:26,wallstreetbets,Funny how Fujifilm now is one of the bast digital camera manufacturers with really great stuff
2021-05-27 08:49:01,wallstreetbets,Kodak is dead over 10 year ago!!
2021-05-27 09:21:45,wallstreetbets,"You should read the investigation documents published by both Kodak and the DFC. You will see that the only shenanigans were caused by the Trump admin not the company or the DFC. They wanted to make a big press hoohar about it to make trump look good. 

The reality is it's sad they became a target for the Dems to attack to the Republicans with claims of insider trading. They were in reality a proxy in a political battle. 

Personally the politics is irrelevant to me. I've read all the documents, I've read all the recent filings and I've looked at the numbers. I care about value not perception."
2021-05-27 08:50:47,wallstreetbets,This type of response is exactly why it's a value play. Numbers don't lie but perceptions blind.
2021-05-27 09:00:21,wallstreetbets,This is what people were saying about GameStop. You people are the worst.
2021-05-27 09:23:33,wallstreetbets,"A document released by the company claiming to exonerate itself? Shocking. The executives just “happened” to offload a shit ton of shares at the exact same time? Probably legit 🙄

I’m also talking about value. I don’t see it. But good luck with your bet."
2021-05-27 08:52:58,wallstreetbets,"Okay, let wait and see! Maybe take another year for Kodak, but right now is AMC and GME time!"
2021-05-27 09:02:59,wallstreetbets,You should sell it and move into either AMC or GME before it too late!!
2021-05-27 09:01:45,wallstreetbets,I bet only you bought into Kodak in this group!!! Sad 😞
2021-05-27 09:28:00,wallstreetbets,"Actually nobody offloaded any shares. The management bought shares. They never sold any. One director apparently gifted some to charity but in light of the investigation they were returned. 

The investigation was conducted by an independent law firm. You can claim that was not ""really"" independent but I disagree. The law firm would be held accountable if it was misleading and it's own reputation would be damaged. 

Honestly you should read the documents if you really want to understand what went on and come to your own conclusions. 

In any event it's immaterial. I believe the company was not at fault and they never actually were granted a loan nor will they be granted one. This is not the reason I have invested, that's in the past."
2021-05-27 09:04:53,wallstreetbets,"No, but as a photographer I can promise you that based on its name alone, Kodak will never actually die and could easily turn itself around. There's still a lot of potential there and this seems like a pretty valid play. It's the same as believing Blackberry or Nokia has a future."
2021-05-27 09:06:29,wallstreetbets,"Okay, I’ll think about it after AMC and GME squeeze"

Technically there is a maximum amount that can be handled by the Nasdaq since may 17 wich is at 1,844,674,407,370,955.1615 USD

2021-05-27 12:31:22,wallstreetbets,Ok with 75 mio shares of gme it would be 24 millions per share at maximum. But the rest of market has to tank to zero. I see no problems here.

2021-05-27 17:26:56,wallstreetbets,"Speaking of ludicrous shit happening.  Remember in 2020 when GME was for sure headed for bankruptcy?

Then remember in February on the way down it was idiotic to pick up more shares because it was definitely headed to bankruptcy?

Now GME is debt free.  Collected an extra $250 million by selling 3 million shares in to the market that didn't even make a dent in the share price.

Who is still betting against GME at this point?  Fuckin whackadoos.  GME is the golden child of 2021.  Seriously."

Tomorrow will be big profit taking. The recent massive reverse repo may be the hedge funds last stand to try and blow up our rocket ship to the moon. One last cash land line to support a short push plus open short interest has only increased this week.  
THIS IS NOT THE SQUEEZE.  
No one has started covering their positions yet which means its a trap. My gut tells me institutions and funds will flush their shares soon....like Friday. In an attempt to ignite a sell off and use their media outlets to say the squeeze is over; aw shucks the WSB boys got us again! Do NOT fall for it.  
The squeeze hasn't started yet. This isn't the show or even us in the lobby waiting for the show. This is pure FOMO, price action, and small gamma daisy-chained squeezes. And sec under Gensler is restricting dark pools access and increasing mark to market timelines for the shorts.  
If we close above $26 on Friday that is 220k call options in the money - they will have to eat 22+ million shares. That is INSANE. Just. DON'T. SELL!"

2021-05-27 14:59:59,wallstreetbets,AMC LETS GOOOOOOO
2021-05-27 15:10:20,wallstreetbets,Never mind that 99.9% of the worlds wealth would be held by AMC and GME stockholders if we reached that.
2021-05-27 15:12:57,wallstreetbets,We got AMC and GME . Now Let’s take GAP stocks to the moon next
2021-05-27 15:59:08,wallstreetbets,What is to stop Robinhood from pulling the same shit they did in January?  With AMC this time?  They didn't get in any trouble.  None.  What is to stop them from locking us out of buying the stock and killing this whole thing?  Nothing.  And I don't even TRADE with Robinhood.  I've seen what they are capable of in this scenario with what they did to GME and there were no repercussions for them.
2021-05-27 15:59:17,wallstreetbets,"What can we expect tomorrow? More of the same?

Buy even more?"
2021-05-27 19:04:18,wallstreetbets,GME IS HITING 20M+.THIS IS MY FLOOR ANYTHING ELSE IS PAPPER HANDING!

2021-05-27 10:20:35,wallstreetbets,1.8 quadrillion?  Look...if amc gets pushed to $1000 a share I pay off my house and my truck. That’s all I’m in this for.
2021-05-27 10:15:52,wallstreetbets,"Once again, if this was a simple smoothed brain investor posting this then my friend we are going to the moon.

2021-05-27 16:37:54,wallstreetbets,I don’t need a gazillion. There is an amount of $AMC that would make a difference. $100 would buy a great deal of peace of mind. $200 would be freedom. Anything over that would be icing on the cake.

If 1,844,674,407,370,955.1615 USD is the ceiling in an infinity squeeze, then 1,844,674,407,370,955.1614 USD is the floor.  This is the kind of math I can do without overdoing the crayons.

""To a completely understandable required limitation on Infinity, and Beyond!!!"" 

Eh, actually no, not beyond..

""To a completely understandable required limitation on Infinity, and no more!!"""

2021-05-27 13:13:56,wallstreetbets,GME carried the other meme stocks to the moon in january. Right now AMC is doing it cause of their utilization rate and high ctb fee. Either way they are both winners
2021-05-27 10:37:26,wallstreetbets,"I’m sad to report I sold my 3 shares of amc a while back at a tiny profit, but it had been negative so long that I panicked when it was positive. Kept my 4 gme shares, not making another mistake!"
2021-05-27 14:51:32,wallstreetbets,Been holding. Will continue to hold 💎🚀✊

2021-05-27 14:11:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m not thinking of millions.  If GME hits 10k it’ll be life changing for me (assuming I sell all my shares at that exact price)

2021-05-27 15:49:49,wallstreetbets,"$420,069 is the price target"

2021-05-27 17:35:57,wallstreetbets,You have to think in this way. If you were a big whale this stock hitting 1k with 1k shares in your depot is one million. Would you sell? Probably. People with more shares even more
2021-05-27 13:40:49,wallstreetbets,"No, 1 million is realistic honestly and even higher. I am not even fucking with you. Did you read the DD? If you haven't, you should and you will realize that it is likely to hit 20 million at the very least and beyond. READ THE DD !!! Trust me, it will make you feel a lot better."

2021-05-27 15:18:28,wallstreetbets,"AMC is likely not gonna get much higher than 30-40, I sold at 27 a piece. Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered. As far as gme, you should wait till you're positive then sell. I sold today because I'm making a big purchase soon and am liquidizing my short term stuff as long as I'm positive, you do you."
2021-05-27 14:06:09,wallstreetbets,buy a few shares of AMC if you can. its the next gme

I mean in theory, without Government intervention, the price can hit the millions.

Now, in reality will it? No... I don't think the US Gov is going to sit back and let $70T of insurance money get wiped out and allow an economic collapse to happen."
2021-05-27 10:07:45,wallstreetbets,What makes you think they will?
2021-05-27 14:07:14,wallstreetbets,just wait for it to crest into GME territory over the next few weeks.  that'll teach you not to get your paper hands wet.

Should have could have would have..

I should have sold it in January when it first reached $19 where i had $10k gains. But then it dropped back to $6. I should've sold then and bought back lower.

Oh well..

Hinsight...😅🥲"
2021-05-27 11:52:53,wallstreetbets,Just buy now. When amc is worth $100k per share I’ll gladly help you clean the shit in your pants.

2021-05-27 16:39:02,wallstreetbets,I sold my AMC at a slight loss to buy more GME when it dropped to $40
2021-05-27 14:23:47,wallstreetbets,"I paperhanded AMC yesterday.  I was sitting on it at $13.75 for so long (\~5 months), figured if it ever got to $14 I'd cut and run.

I sold all at $18.25 yesterday and doubled my quantity of new shares in BB.

I bought BB @ $8.99 and it's now at $9.75, so I'll take some solace in that.  My wife's boyfriend said it was an aladeen move.  I don't know what to say."
2021-05-27 10:44:37,wallstreetbets,"Also sold most of my shares of AMC a couple weeks ago thinking I could make more money elsewhere. Avg was 10.88 I think and I sold in the 11.50 range maybe. 


Guess who feels stupid now. Also put it into Twitter when it went down on earnings thinking it would quickly recover. Turns out it went down way more but it's getting closer to where I bought it. 

I do have 4 more shares or so of AMC on Cashapp I got when they suspended buying and selling, but the goddamn app won't open on my phone now so I'm forced to diamond hands. 

Still got the GME. Up a decent amount and hoping we can pick everyone else up. My portfolio is finally green again but it's a lot of fun to lose money"
2021-05-27 15:21:36,wallstreetbets,I actually almost sold as well. 75 shares had been sitting there at a negative for 5 months. Decided to hold on to them because why the hell not. Very glad I did because I’m looking at my first ever gain of $1200. Feels good. I’ve only got 7 GME shares and I’ll be holding right there with you
2021-05-27 16:37:52,wallstreetbets,I done the same for a tiny profit. But a little while back I bought more. Staying put this time.
2021-05-27 12:12:46,wallstreetbets,"I feel your paid. I had 73 shares of amc at $6.63. watched it sit in the red for weeks and once I was able to get out I took the $130 profit... Kicking myself now.

I did take that money and for 3 shares of gme for $187.71. 🤣"

That’s 5x the value of the fucking US GDP on a 50M share float. 

The money doesn’t exist and if the fed printed the rest (they wouldn’t) that money would be worthless."
2021-05-27 08:35:37,wallstreetbets,Because you’re susceptible to suggestion and easily influenced.

2021-05-27 10:13:01,wallstreetbets,The US government also doesn't want to bankrupt hedge funds and banks while causing a depression just to satisfy GME retail investors.

2021-05-27 11:21:49,wallstreetbets,Yeah understandable. At what point do you think you'll sell now? I was hoping to see it hit $26 and was uncertain but after seeing today's performance I'm not as doubtful. My moonshot is $33. Kind of thinking of making a post to show how much I'm in for if that would inspire confidence in the community but not sure what posting it would do
2021-05-27 16:21:27,wallstreetbets,You should have sold in January? Are you sure about that? It hit 29 some hours ago.
2021-05-27 19:25:04,wallstreetbets,Did you sell today?
2021-05-27 13:10:55,wallstreetbets,"Pay someone to help you*

2021-05-27 17:46:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah I get what a buffer overflow is
2021-05-27 11:10:48,wallstreetbets,I been holding my amc for I think 3 months now or longer I don’t remember but every time I had the urge to hit that sell button I just closed the screen and walked away 💎💎🙌🤪
2021-05-27 10:56:56,wallstreetbets,If it makes you feel better I bought about 80 shares at around $12.50 each and sold at a 10% loss when gme took off but amc just kept going down and they liquidated more of their shares. I just felt like amc was what wallstreet wanted to distract us with instead of gme and it was going nowhere. Stings a bit now but at least I still have gme!
2021-05-27 13:51:25,wallstreetbets,"I did the same thing, fellow smooth brain."
2021-05-27 12:57:19,wallstreetbets,"I bought 45 at $6.57. I've just been holding on to them.

Thank God I'm lazy."
2021-05-27 12:09:57,wallstreetbets,That’s what they want you to believe.

2021-05-27 15:52:32,wallstreetbets,You cant handle the truth!
2021-05-27 17:19:09,wallstreetbets,"Sure. Let’s ignore whether there are hidden shorts, fails to deliver, etc. etc. for a second. For purposes of this discussion, I will concede the validity of all of that due diligence (even though I think 99.9% of it is complete nonsense, just for full disclosure). 

During the first short squeeze at the end of January, large swaths of retail were disallowed from buying GME which ultimately alleviated the squeeze. There is zero reason to suspect this wouldn’t happen again. If hedge funds, the DTC and brokerages really are staring at potential insolvency and financial collapse, there’s nothing they won’t do to prevent it. Likewise with the SEC itself. They will not let a single stock bring down the global economy - they’ll halt trading in it long before that happens. So what if they have to go testify in front of Congress again - they’ll still be in business and people will move on. Retail simply does not have a way to counter this. Retail is playing a game where if by some stroke of luck they caught lightning in a bottle twice, hedge funds, brokerages and the SEC would change the rules again before the squeeze approached anything resembling $1,000,000 a share. It’s not going to happen - it’s a pipe dream."
2021-05-27 17:35:48,wallstreetbets,he’s talking about GME. AMC unlikely to hit past 100k my prediction. who knows tho

2021-05-27 10:51:02,wallstreetbets,"Not saying I disagree with you, but in the universe where this does squeeze it’s not because of retail investors on the long side"

2021-05-27 15:36:47,wallstreetbets,I’d argue the theatre experience is even more niche for the same reason and until we see AMC announce a streaming service that can actually compete with the likes of Netflix and Disney and such it’s kinda a shit company that isn’t even trying to recover

2021-05-27 15:27:31,wallstreetbets,"$6k per year, but it accumulates if you don’t use it, and any withdrawals get added back in to your available total in the next year. So, if I take $20k out this year, my max contribution would increase by $26k next year."
2021-05-27 15:28:34,wallstreetbets,like 5.5k CAD a year nowadays from when you turn 18 but it was a little more before Trudeau. 20k pounds is a lot of money a year to be able to add without having to pay any capital gains on the earnings from those investments.

Seems this is the MGM entertainment division...its selling in the basement of my TD Ameritrade account on the  ""Grey Market"" (that don't sound to reassuring)  @ $80 a share.

I've read that in older deals if you buy the stock in the old company when the deal is made you can get a piece of the parent company...

Is this a 9D Chess move to get some part of  the $3K plus Amazon stock in the near future for $80?

2021-05-27 06:39:38,wallstreetbets,Lmao you won’t get a $3000 stock for $80 it’ll be a fractional share in that case unless you own $3000 worth of stock in MGMB

2021-05-27 15:21:07,wallstreetbets,Sell AMC at ~37 / 40 buy GME at ~245 Sell GME at ~500 not a bad double down on profits strategy lets see how it pans out.
2021-05-27 15:21:43,wallstreetbets,30 and 250 are big big numbers for gamma. 30 especially for AMC because those options can be affordably exercised like in the beginning of GME squeeze. Difference is there’s just so many more shares outstanding for AMC it’s tougher to move each dollar.
2021-05-27 15:21:54,wallstreetbets,Every time AMC hits 50 percent gain it dumps 5 percent lol

This is what GME can look like as long as retailers hold.  This is what January should have looked like when the FOMO began.  They are +32% higher than their January intraday highs.  That would put GME's equivalent at $637 with more runway ahead of it.

Having an actual crisis over here. 

I thought the market worked and that revenue and value actually meant something. Even if we sometimes joke it doesn’t. 

But AMC has showed me it really doesn’t matter. Anything can be a 10Billion dollar company as long as you want it to be. 

That lemonade stand on the corner of the street maned by girl scouts?  It too can be a 10Billion dollar company as long as you believe it can be. 

Extremely depressed."

2021-05-27 06:27:37,wallstreetbets,Find a bunch of copper wire and sell it to a scrapper for cash then deposit into RH and buy AMC
2021-05-27 07:10:15,wallstreetbets,Easy. It hit $10 after market trading. It’ll get there shortly after open if volume is there.
2021-05-27 17:52:00,wallstreetbets,"You need an exit strategy. Don't listen to memes, or FB mom group members that want you to be their bagholder.

Stop for a moment and think: what are my life goals? Why did I enter this trade? What do I want to get out of it? What can I do with the profit I'm looking at right now? If I was looking at this for the first time, with $0 in, would I enter now at these prices?

What do you think will feel worse: Missing out on a few % more gains, or watching it crash and being left with 90% less than what you could take now. Do you want to be able to tell a story about how you got 10x, 20x, 100x gains, or a sad sack story about how you ""could have"" had whatever you could lock in right now, but blew it and missed out.

You can't call the top, if you try to achieve some magical beautiful exit where you sell everything exactly at the top, you will get burned. 

Take profits incrementally on the way up and be happy with them because it can all evaporate in seconds when the show is over. **Go look at GME and AMC and BB and PLTR and NOK charts from 1/27.** It probably won't be a nice gradual decent back to reality."

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Time to : Short $GLD | GC 1850$ August put Welcome back to my TIME TO (tm) series :

**Shorting $GLD**

$GLD mostly follows real rates and then the $. 

What has allowed $GLD to prosper recently has been :

a) Ever dovish FED decreasing nominal rates as much as they can via their speeches & slower than expected job gains which have cemented FED forecasts

b) Ever rising inflation expectations due to faulty base effects that are transitory

c) Some impact from Crapto crash with money flowing back into $GLD (some of it at least :/)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I think there has been a gestalt shift on all three items 

a) FED's Clarida & Quarles yesterday have both suggested the beginning of tapering discussions 

> Late yesterday, the Fed’s Quarles said “it will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.” Quarles is the Fed’s Vice Chair for Supervision and it is unusual for him to comment on monetary policy. 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/gold-slips-from-four-month-high-as-central-banks-views-in-focus](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/gold-slips-from-four-month-high-as-central-banks-views-in-focus)

aBis) The NFP last month was a serious miss but it's not gonna be repeated : as schools reopen and UIs are not extended in a lot of states, the slaves will go back to finding a slave master before jobs run out. employers have also adjusted somewhat with regards to wage expectations already which should make for a much more balanced jobs market going into the begining of school season

b) Inflation (in CPI sense) has peaked in April or will peak now, Commos have crashed thanks to our lords and saviors, the ccp tightening margins and putting an end to this story. 

c) Crapto stabilized

**All of this points to higher real rates which are really at the bottom of what they could ever be thus we have to sell $GLD**"

I can see it where I live. There is a hunger for consumption and prices are going up for products and services equally. Maybe this time it is different.

Regarding the Fed statements: They have to sing from that hymn sheet. Expected inflation is an important driver of real inflation. If they fail to manage expected inflation then inflation becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Many think that the Fed will be forced to taper in Q1 / Q2 2022."

Productivity growth

all of the companies in $QQQ have one job and it's to deflate costs, they are good at it. 

Also : Base effects, last year APRIL CPI was really low, CPI is a YoY comparaison so that's why it was so big in April. next months last year CPI got up decently so it will be hard to beat the comparaisons. 

When you examine the content of the APRIL CPI you see that all the stuff that contributed to higher CPI is transitory : used car price jump being the biggest among them

Btw, Inflation being transitory doesn't MEAN THAT PRICES WILL GO BACK DOWN TO WHERE THEY WERE. IT SIMPLY MEANS THEY WON T GROW AGAIN AT THE SAME RATE."

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is Virgin Galactic stock expensive, fair, or cheap priced? Virgin Galactic has two revenue streams.

1. Commercial Passenger Flights:

They expect to fly 25 commercial flights in 2022, with six passengers each, which means 150 passengers for 2022.

Ticket cost is around $250k, which translates into revenues of approximately $37.5 million from Commercial Passengers in 2022

2. Additional Revenue:

Besides commercial passengers, the company has also generated some revenue by carrying payloads into space in recent years. Assuming that this will grow to about $12 million by 2022, total revenues would stand at $50 million for the year.

3) Revenue Per Share

Revenue Per Share is likely to grow to about $0.21 in 2022, assuming total shares outstanding of 234 million.

4. Value Per Share

With a sales multiple of about 70 (contains a certain amount of goodwill), it translates into a stock price of about  $15 per Share.

The current share price is $27 per Share. Assuming the assumptions are correct, this explains the current short ratio of 25%."
2021-05-27 02:06:23,wallstreetbets,"Fair points, but this is more of a speculative stock, investing now expecting further future growth. Early bird gets the worm......or was it the bagel?"
2021-05-27 02:27:23,wallstreetbets,"I think it’s a long hold, plus unlike space x, virgin galactic is space tourism where passenger just go a few miles outsides earth’s atmosphere just so they can experience space. And not launched into a different stratosphere, meaning risk is minimal. I think a mother ship allows less risk too. 

Also think of future developments of possible flying routes that can streamline airline services. Currently I think most of the market is over valued so to single out SPCE is being picky."
2021-05-27 02:15:23,wallstreetbets,"It's a pretty scalable business model though. There are about 50 million millionaires in the world, many of whom would love to go to space. Once you engineer one spaceship, it's pretty easy to manufacture another dozen or two. Once you find one empty desert to launch airplanes that launch spaceships, it's pretty easy to find another two dozen launch sites near major cities. So 150 passengers in 2022 would not justify the price. But thousands in 2032, discounted to today's dollars easily would."
2021-05-27 03:03:19,wallstreetbets,"They are looking at $400k per seat for starting off. They’ll also be expanding so expect more flights over the next years but cheaper rates( coming back to 250k). They’ll have government deals and agency deals with the likes of nasa. They’ll then expand into point to point travel, which is another stream of revenue. Like you say the stock is overvalued because of the lack of revenue currently, but people don’t want to miss the boat or ship or space ship."

If you got the same money back today, then your $1 investment would only return $1 in total return because there is no opportunity cost or risk. The market won't compensate you for not doing anything because 100 other people would be willing to take the same deal.

In the case of Virgin Galactic, if one of the ships works, I'm willing to bet they can just copy the same blueprints and make a bunch more. And it seems like there is a great deal of demand for the tickets. And it seems like they can keep costs low with reusable ships. Plus, there is no competition. By the time Blue Origin or SpaceX start offering tourists trips into space, many wealthy boomers will have died. My guess is that they'll want to experience weightlessness while they are still alive, and Virgin Galactic would be their only opportunity."

2021-05-27 02:25:54,wallstreetbets,It’s a fair assumption from a different perspective.
2021-05-27 02:31:19,wallstreetbets,"I’d argue that technically Gamestop is still in a growing industry, we have only seen the early days of gaming, there is room to grow. But what direction can Gamestop take? Hard to say when the industry is splitting in many directions haha"

2021-05-27 04:04:00,wallstreetbets,"Not OP — the gaming industry is absolutely booming. There’s no denying that 

However, the business model GME employed in that industry *is* dying. There’s no denying that, either. 

E-commerce is the way of the future for gaming. GME has to pivot hard to compete in the e-commerce sector if they want to be successful in the long term (talking 5+ years). 

GME has made comments indicating they’ll focus heavily on e-commerce so they should be fine. Additionally the move to add PC gaming and components will add a new revenue stream that makes up a large chunk of the gaming sector."
2021-05-27 11:23:50,wallstreetbets,Retail is a dying industry. Never said gaming is dying.

Rough idea on timeline for something like this to actually come to fruition?"
2021-05-27 08:28:07,wallstreetbets,Should be including incentives and infrastructure for Natgas and RNG for vehicles along with electric.   Shifting from gasoline/diesel for transportation would be good all around.  It’s important to maintain fuel diversity to avoid single source supply issues.

2021-05-27 08:47:00,wallstreetbets,Did you not read the article?
2021-05-27 05:12:39,wallstreetbets,"“The bill would limit tax credits to vehicles with a retail price below $80,000 to qualify for the tax credits. The current maximum tax credit is $7,500 with no maximum price and currently phases out for individual automakers once they hit 200,000 total EVs sold.

Both General Motors and Tesla have hit the cap and currently do not qualify for the $7,500 tax credit.

The “Clean Energy for America” bill, which advanced on a 14-14 tie vote, would eliminate the existing EV cap, while the credit would phase-out over three years once 50% of U.S. passenger vehicle sales were EVs. It has numerous other green energy tax incentives and would rescind or cut many fossil fuel tax provisions.

The EV proposal led by Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, would boost the $7,500 tax credit by $2,500 for vehicles assembled in the United States and another $2,500 for cars at facilities whose production workers are members of, or represented by, a labor union.

That would mean smaller credits to automakers such as Tesla, Volkswagen and others who do not have U.S. union workers, and companies building EVs outside the United States.”

Looks like it would help Tesla, but definitely help Ford more"
2021-05-27 10:04:15,wallstreetbets,"You just quoted the whole article to restate what I said

I didn't say anything about Tesla and GM compared to others. They are both currently being phased out on their credits so far behind others

This puts them back at $7,500 and helps them significantly

Not sure what your point is. I read it the first time"

The thing I like about BB is that they actually have a future and BB might actually be undervalued at this point. I love to play the other ""meme stocks"" as well to catch their run-ups but I feel like they're valuations are pretty disjointed from reality. BB is legitimately a solid play."
2021-05-27 04:02:58,wallstreetbets,Why sell at that point?
2021-05-27 01:38:18,wallstreetbets,I sold calls last Tuesday so BB decides to break my strike the following day and now -144% . 🥲

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"100,000 SNDL 🌱 Options Bought Today expiring Friday! So this is a legitimate stat. Whoever was selling $1 strike options expiring this Friday for a penny, you are so greedy and there’s a good chance you’re about to get your face ripped off. 

Retail shorts have hopped on the bandwagon and when stocks move they tend to over shoot the upside and the downside. 

Sundial has over $1 billion in cash, no debt, positive operating profit, and many valuable passive investments. 

The manipulation that the stock received was absolutely insane. Institutional ownership was less than 2% when SNDL made it’s run in Feb and the big boys didn’t want to miss the party and they paid motley fool to write bash articles while they accumulate their position. This is just my assumption, which is never a good thing when valuing stocks, but as a former stock analyst I would bet that institutional ownership will be over 5% very soon and then 10%. 

SNDL is breaking out with insane call volume bought today expiring Friday. This company has the fundamentals to back it up and very good things could be coming. Not to mention it’s a prime acquisition target with its super strong balance sheet."
2021-05-26 22:33:02,wallstreetbets,"I tried to buy some of those earlier this week but the orders didn't go through. Gonna try again for tomorrow, but it's $4 already."

2021-05-27 09:33:06,wallstreetbets,"Potential gamma squeeze on this?

It's been trading around $0.75 all week then suddenly jumped to $0.85 yesterday and $0.95 in premarket right now. 

&#x200B;

There are 106k $1 calls expiring tomorrow. If those have to be hedged that's 10,600,000 shares to cover those, how many would already be covered at this point?"

2021-05-27 05:24:51,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-27 02:30:57,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea whether SNDL is a good stock or not or whether there will be a squeeze or where the stock ends up...

BUT, get your fact right.

The company has current assets, less current liabilities of about 900M in Canadian Dollars, which is about $738M USD.

They had at 2/11/2021 1,561,352,718 shares outstanding so at a share price of $0.8815 the market cap is $1.376B USD.

So you are paying a $640M premium over book value for this company. If the company can make money that might be fine. If not then the stock is valued $640M too much or about 45% too much)."

2021-05-27 03:32:23,wallstreetbets,Weed is so 2000 and late.
2021-05-26 22:21:27,wallstreetbets,This industry has a high environmental toll and isn’t green at all.
2021-05-26 22:42:51,wallstreetbets,How does selling for less than market value make you greedy?
2021-05-27 03:22:46,wallstreetbets,Their revenue according to their market cap is very weak
2021-05-27 03:38:39,wallstreetbets,"I may get in, but leaning towards no. 

Revenue was crazy low last quarter, even when comparing to same quarter a year ago (over 50%). They attribute a 30% decrease in marijuana sales, compared to prior quarter, to price competition. 

I think revenue will continue to strain on marijuana sales unless supply gets in check. Everyone is trying to grow marijuana and brand loyalty hasn’t penetrated the mmj market yet. It’s a commodity.

You may make money, but I think there are real risks here. Maybe I’ll play the earnings call, idk."
2021-05-27 07:30:52,wallstreetbets,This sub is so retarded I can’t tell if this guy bought 100k options or if that’s the total transacted amount in the market
2021-05-26 22:35:26,wallstreetbets,"Wow over a billion in cash! Way to do nothing with it and lose out to inflation. Note, a company that has cash but isn’t doing shit with it isn’t really a good thing."
2021-05-26 23:27:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah but I heard their weed sucks
2021-05-26 23:56:32,wallstreetbets,Mods delete
2021-05-27 03:26:10,wallstreetbets,they grow awful weed. seriously. nobody likes their product. thats why its <$1
2021-05-27 09:09:31,wallstreetbets,"This is the same SNDL that shipped moldy product with pieces of latex gloves inside right? Legitimately asking if they've turned a corner. Thought it was worth buying into months ago, but if quality control still can't keep up with demand this will end up dead in the water"
2021-05-27 18:48:24,wallstreetbets,"Nice fucking post with no positions retard.

You know SNDL is a well known shit tank pretty much invented to take stock holders money right?"
2021-05-27 07:43:56,wallstreetbets,What company hired you as a stock analyst? After how many days did they fire you when they figured out you were useless?
2021-05-27 16:16:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, Um. You don’t actually exchange securities or their derivatives with other individuals. There are market makers that keep them in “inventory”. And you’re a dumb fuck for buying SNDL. That is all. :)"
2021-05-27 16:39:26,wallstreetbets,I bailed out of SNDL and into HITIF. Long term I think it will be a better investment.
2021-05-26 23:57:29,wallstreetbets,"You have to change your broker. If it’s free, small and a sellout, chances are your order is last on the queue"

auto selling by the custodian since calls were sold at a penny the leverage and margin requirement is insane if the stock starts to move"
2021-05-27 09:00:51,wallstreetbets,4000 @ .89 retard checking in.   ...do I really need to state that I'm aretard?

2021-05-26 22:42:15,wallstreetbets,Lol hello do you have a brain? Look at the 10-Q and listen to the conference call they only it like 50 times. Related to The Valens lol geese you’d are funny. SNDL to the moon
2021-05-27 19:59:51,wallstreetbets,"Asset value per share at March 31, 2021, including cash, loans, marketable securities and the Olds facility at net book value was approximately $1.08 billion or $0.61 per share."
2021-05-27 14:20:48,wallstreetbets,Amazon trades at 15 times price to book. Barely 2:1 looks sweet to me
2021-05-27 09:10:31,wallstreetbets,When you talk facts they don’t listen. I’ll be sure to take their money again here shortly. They rather be in their own dream world
2021-05-27 00:03:50,wallstreetbets,What’s incorrect about anything I said? I’ve been a holder of SNDL for over a year
2021-05-27 01:20:49,wallstreetbets,"Wow nicely done. This could print hard. Even if it doesn't, it was worth the gamble"
2021-05-26 22:31:32,wallstreetbets,Good call! I might do the same
2021-05-26 22:34:12,wallstreetbets,lol okay get ready to lose it all
2021-05-27 04:58:16,wallstreetbets,Sundial for Patients. GameStop for Dudebros? lmfao
2021-05-26 22:18:46,wallstreetbets,Give me legitimate numbers and reasons. SNDL is so undervalued and you have nothing legit to say except dilution 😆
2021-05-26 22:22:38,wallstreetbets,"It’s also great for mental health, medicine, and depression which overrides nature stuff"
2021-05-26 22:34:54,wallstreetbets,Facts. Microplastic nightmare. Energy whores.
2021-05-27 00:20:03,wallstreetbets,Oil is the same thing.
2021-05-26 22:45:03,wallstreetbets,They sold for $1 and market value is now $4 for those options so what are you taking about? The buyer is up 4x and the seller is already down 4x
2021-05-27 07:03:36,wallstreetbets,"But MEMEs & Shotcoins, yeh iJump ALL iN!!!"
2021-05-27 00:07:35,wallstreetbets,What else would u do with 1B cash debt free while investing into other companies
2021-05-26 22:41:52,wallstreetbets,Lol you realize they’ve made a ton of recent acquisitions right? As marijuana valuations have fallen. If they did your plan they would have no cash and ownership on companies that are down 50%. SNDL knows what they are doing
2021-05-27 07:00:44,wallstreetbets,You still thinking back 3 months?? Alot has happened since then.
2021-05-26 23:28:52,wallstreetbets,They have multiple brand names including top leaf. They just bought a ton of high thc strains recently that will start to be harvested this summer
2021-05-26 23:58:03,wallstreetbets,Lol you and your holy insight?
2021-05-27 19:56:55,wallstreetbets,Nope new management since then
2021-05-27 19:55:38,wallstreetbets,Wait and see
2021-05-27 17:59:54,wallstreetbets,Lol you are completely wrong. Mm can have some but obviously is not on one end of every derivative transaction
2021-05-27 01:15:54,wallstreetbets,Could also be that my limit was at the bid and no one sold at that number.
2021-05-27 08:17:09,wallstreetbets,Yessss🚀$SNDL gang rise up!
2021-05-27 15:20:30,wallstreetbets,"6700 shares with a $ 0.91 buy-in and lasts, I don't even understand why you sold it..I keep up to $ 3 and buy 100 per hour as you would expect from a wsb member $$$"
2021-05-27 09:06:17,wallstreetbets,"True, sentiment is king in this brave new world 🌎"
2021-05-26 22:49:13,wallstreetbets,"Obviously you don't have a brain. As I thought, you can't read financial statements either. For the quarter ending March 31, SNDL had an operating margin of -187% and a net profit margin of -1358%. They had gross revenue of 7.8 million, an operating loss of -14.67 million, and a net loss of -106.18 million. 

Get rekt, smoothbrain 🧠"
2021-05-27 14:54:06,wallstreetbets,Amen to that
2021-05-27 14:51:55,wallstreetbets,"Who cares about that metric in isolation. What are the projected discounted cash flows if you want to value it that way? By your logic, you can put your money in company go public and people should give you twice the money for it. Then you can take your new double stacked pile of cash, put it in another company and go public and double your money again... rinse and repeat.

Your suggested approach to investing sounds like a ponzi scheme not a value investment approach.

Not saying anything about what the value of the company should be or if a good trade or not, just things being said here are inherently flawed and meaningless."
2021-05-27 14:20:47,wallstreetbets,"Good luck. Like I said, I am not offering an opinion on the value of the stock, just annoying to see DD that makes clearly false claims that don't align with public data. It is lazy. They go to Yahoo or wherever and assume the float numbers reported there are necessarily correct. They have not figured out that you cannot assume this data is a starting point for research and you need to go check the SEC filings and do your work to make sure you have the correct data. Getting the shares outstanding right obviously has huge implications for value judgements."
2021-05-27 00:13:53,wallstreetbets,They are cash positive but not profitable. EPS is negative.
2021-05-26 22:47:18,wallstreetbets,I see your gonna talk yourself into believing that but the charts dont lie
2021-05-26 22:22:18,wallstreetbets,Their share price is nowhere near what their actual valuation is supposed to be. They offered way too many shares and their float is ridiculous. They are still overvalued. There is no way they are worth their market cap. Not even close.
2021-05-26 22:27:52,wallstreetbets,"Tell me how much you're down right now and why you initially invested. Their earnings are down, way down. Unless they actually move units nothing will happen. Who has a majority holding in this company? Another Lehman Brothers holding crapshoot. Good luck!"
2021-05-26 22:24:48,wallstreetbets,Maybe when Greta starts to smoke it!
2021-05-26 23:11:20,wallstreetbets,What industry isn’t? It makes people happy. It will make money. SNDL is the way
2021-05-26 22:47:49,wallstreetbets,"Exactly lol, so how is the seller greedy if they sold 1$ when market value is 4$? How tf that make.you greedy?"
2021-05-27 15:17:28,wallstreetbets,Nice $1 there buddy
2021-05-27 18:49:13,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, doctor"
2021-05-27 03:44:25,wallstreetbets,revenue of 7.8?? damn thats less than what some laundromats make.

2021-05-27 15:09:34,wallstreetbets,"If I wanted value, I'd invest in blue chips. I realize this is the equivalent of spinning the roulette wheel. It's a penny stock that's heavily shorted. The premium over book value is justified. Just because this company has 45% less assets than the market cap doesn't mean shit. Companies require manpower and years of aggressive expansion. Go ahead with your 900 million Canadian and make a company as good as sundial? Don't really work like that, you pay the premium cause they put in the work. Just cause Amazon trades at 15 times book value, doesn't mean someone can take 1/15th of the market cap of Amazon and make a company nearly as successful. I am more than willing to pay a premium on the book value, because it's just realistic."
2021-05-27 00:23:00,wallstreetbets,Expected 2021 eps is $-.01 but they had positive  normalized operating profit last quarter for the first time ever which is huge. When you trade at book value what do you expect?
2021-05-26 22:23:39,wallstreetbets,"They trade at cash value, no debt, and positive operating profit. Their dilution was at $1.50, which would be great for today’s holders lol. There’s no downside from here. Huge things coming. You don’t have to join but SNDL is trading higher"
2021-05-26 22:42:32,wallstreetbets,5959. @.83. 292 profit
2021-05-26 22:35:41,wallstreetbets,"Initially invested in May 2020 over a year ago in the $0.50 cent range. Shot to over $1.50 the next day and been holding ever since with some
buys and sell below $0.20.  In terms of earnings lol they are up on the bottom line when you take out the one time warrant adjustment. SNDL cut half of workforce in 2020 to focus on profitability obviously if you did any dd. Lol Lehman brothers crapshoot? SNDL has no institutional ownership yet.. but it’s about to. What are you even talking about."
2021-05-26 22:26:02,wallstreetbets,"Lol you know she will. Look at her parents! Cigs are out, weed is in."
2021-05-26 23:34:53,wallstreetbets,"Not disagreeing. Just a comical amount of irony in “green”

I’ve held SNDL since 9/20"
2021-05-26 22:49:41,wallstreetbets,Bc they are selling $1 calls for a penny. They are getting no premium on that at all but are on the hook for a ton of risk. That’s greed
2021-05-26 22:56:31,wallstreetbets,And? You claimed that they have a positive operating profit which is not true. They have NEVER had a positive operating profit since they have been a public company. Might explain why it has collapsed from $11 to a penny stock since going public.

2021-05-27 15:17:24,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree with this, but now you are going from premium on book value to talking about enterprise value, which implies future ability to make profits. My point was suggesting you are investing or trading because of some metric in isolation (literally my first sentence) did not seem to make any sense."
2021-05-27 08:20:00,wallstreetbets,Exactly. You are right sir
2021-05-26 22:38:37,wallstreetbets,"They own 520,000 already. Just wait and see what they do soon 👍"
2021-05-26 22:45:29,wallstreetbets,Call me when weed is federally legal.
2021-05-26 23:37:02,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m with you. The glass containers weed comes in is a bit dramatic. Hopefully it will get better as people start buying quantities heavier than 8ths at a time. Nice I did some buying and selling around 9/20 you must have gotten in a t a great price if you held.
2021-05-26 23:06:35,wallstreetbets,If you look at the option volume for today the majority was in the morning before the equity buying took off. No one knows what happened for sure. Time will give us a little idea. Expecting greats things ahead for SNDL. Best of luck to you!
2021-05-26 23:03:20,wallstreetbets,"Or they could have sold for .2,.3,or how bout .4? Sound like they just stupid or wanted to offload a bag. They might not be th contract writer either, maybe someone who been trying to get off of them. If so they have no risk whatsoever.

Sounds like someone was relieved rather than greedy. But it's just an opinion, well prolly never know."
2021-05-26 22:58:11,wallstreetbets,Lol what don’t you get. $1.7 million in operating profit. Are you really that stupid? Click the link which is the earnings release. It’s the first line. I feel sorry for your bloodline.
2021-05-27 00:09:21,wallstreetbets,I personally made thousands w them back in Feb. I've tripled my position and am currently up. Gtfo. We are about to moon.

2021-05-27 15:29:54,wallstreetbets,Crawling back to what? SNDL probably won't even be relevant by the time they legalize weed federally...
2021-05-26 23:07:16,wallstreetbets,Lololol great line when you’re proved wrong
2021-05-26 22:55:11,wallstreetbets,It’s already climbing. Yahoo finance shows 4.79%. Many stocks have 80%+ institutional ownership. That’s pretty standard tbh

You have $79k in your trading account 😂 I’ve made more than that in a day.
2021-05-26 23:03:43,wallstreetbets,Agreed! Always like it when I see a stock with under 40% institutional ownership. So SNDL is a real gem under 5%
2021-05-26 23:05:18,wallstreetbets,Only 7 institutions owned it last time I checked. That’s insane. Gonna be much higher soon

All materials you need for cars and batteries have to be mined or extracted from the ground. The massive source of energy has to come from power plants and the more demand, the more plants needed. The need for more plastics and chemicals, and the feeling that you are ""helping"" the environment is going to increase further our dependency on fossil fuels and mined materials. The carbon offsets is another sham to make people feel better while not really contributing to the environment as a whole.  

There's no question that Tesla is a valuable brand and that Musk drives the stock, but as electric cars become more mainstream, there will be a switch from fancy niche brands with higher margins to the commoditization of the car until it becomes obsolete.

TSLA is highly overvalued. It might not drop any time soon, but it will happen eventually, unless it manages to make the other auto manufacturers obsolete."

Its slowly sliding into the realm of Enron and this should worry a lot of sensible investors. Even the apes are not touching it. Mostly its hypocritical individuals who want to live a sustainable green life in their bubble by burning rest of the world and pushing it to poverty, famine and hopelessness. 

Tesla is slowly becoming like any other Energy company out there like BP, EXXON, CHEVRON or TOTAL.

His thesis for investing in Tesla is that based on a simple metric of comparing its market cap against other automakers he is convinced that it trades anomalous to the market. In other words he think he found a clear imbalance in the market and accordingly he assumes Tesla is overvalued and will decline in value.

The reason I disagree with him is because I think Tesla's business model will enable them to be far more profitable than any automaker has ever been (profitable enough to support the valuation of the stock). Without getting into the details, some of which are laid out in the post here, I think comparing them to other automakers is about as relevant as comparing Apple when the iPhone launched to other phone makers.

Further, Tesla and EV's bring about benefits to society as a whole (e.g. less climate-change causing carbon, less sickness causing pollution, etc) which justifies, at least till ICE is clearly dead, government benefits funneled that way which should help with profitability in the shorter term. Basically, credits and the like are not going away anytime soon.

I have no idea if he still has his puts open or not, or if he took profits or not. But I suspect we are more likely headed to 1,000+ by year end than the other way."

The only sustainable option would be electrolysis, which requires an incredibly amount of energy if we were to convert all vehicles. Then we need to compress, transport, etc. 

But if we have that much energy, then you can... charge batteries."
2021-05-27 02:04:01,wallstreetbets,"About 25% of global shipping is crude oil... The move to EV's and solar power or other green energy can possibly eliminate much of that shipping. I don't know about the rest of shipping, but possibly as batteries increase in energy density it may be possible to power more and larger ships across the oceans. Also, as the demand worldwide for Oil goes down, perhaps ships can convert to better quality fuels and as a result reduce their emissions. Ships currently use very poor grades of fuel which I think contributes significantly to how bad they are.

To move ships to full electric might take some creative thinking. Perhaps large floating solar panel installations that ships can dock by mid-ocean to charge up will work. No theoretical reason why batteries cannot be fast charged in less than an hour to 80%+ (they can also slow charge over several hours, but you won't want to slow down delivery times too much). There are solutions for going fully electric for ships, the challenge remains  implementing and scaling up (and perhaps some development in higher density batteries)."

2021-05-27 01:43:39,wallstreetbets,"Looking at charts for the performance of Puts on Tesla across many expirations and strikes shows that if you bought puts in Q1 (There is a post on reddit I came across dated 12/8/2020 discussing Michael Burry shorting Tesla already so I think this goes back at least till Q4 2020) you would see that unless he did some great timing of any subsequent trades it is highly doubtful he has made much money, if any (perhaps he lost), on this position.

Even the existing lead acid batteries are recycled. We can recycle well over 90% of the lithium found in batteries. And that's even ignoring that those batteries can have a second life in stationary applications. 

There's an incentive recycle because economically viable lithium mines are not too numerous yet, we are essentially piggybacking on ancient dry lake beds and other places where nature concentrated it for us. However, if you are really annoyed about extracting from the ground, then extract from the ocean. There's plenty. It takes energy though - which is the reason why aluminum can recycling rate is so high. Much less energy to recycle them. 

Power plants are better than tiny, inefficient power plants on every car. 

We are not going to stop car production any time soon. So the comparison is not EVs or nothing, it's EVs vs ICE. If we are going to build cars anyway, it's best if they are not spewing shit in the atmosphere.

2021-05-27 14:14:45,wallstreetbets,"Mr. Rawlinson from Lucid pointed out something, which I agree with, that EV's are a technical ""arms race."" I said their business model will enable them to be far more profitable than any other automaker, not that they are currently.

Clearly if FSD works out, and frankly as an ""automaker"" they are the only one positioned I think to solve it (and I think in general compared to anyone else they are also better positioned here) the profits from that alone would dwarf any automaker's profits.

Besides that, their vertical integration, which they are well ahead of anyone else in that regard, from the manufacturing of parts that go into the car to selling cars direct means a more efficient pipeline and less places to share profits with.

On the battery front, they already are assumed to have the cheapest costs and with the 4680 batteries and the future development they laid out they may be headed to $50 per kWh, whereas others will be paying, perhaps double that amount for batteries.

Their build process is becoming more efficient and cheaper. For example converting the front and back to single casts eliminates 2/3rds (about 600 robots) of your body shop. That means less overhead costs, parts, and inherently a better car build.

Their battery efficiency, which will increase significantly with the 4680 cells and single casts, means less kWh's needed per car, which saves even more money.

I really did not want to get into details of this, rather my point was simply I think they will be more profitable, but from the above you can see some of my thought process here. I would think in every aspect listed above they are years ahead of any competitors. That translates into bigger than ordinary profits I think.

Beyond the above, their efforts in Energy storage and Solar Power should continue to see strong growth and as well that will translate into higher profits. EV's necessitate the need for home or grid energy storage and green energy production, so they both should see strong growth. Finally, we can get speculative, and wonder if they incorporate star link communications into their cars somehow to provide connectivity anyplace in the world. This is perhaps key to self-driving, especially if you are going to have cars driving in places where  the carriers have no service."

Agree, disagree, whatever. Just consider that every car company is trying to show their ""Tesla Killer"" without mentioning Tesla. They are terrified. Not sure why anyone would assume that Tesla is not a threat to the entire industry and decades of experience will win. Decades of experience building engines and transmissions are near worthless for EV's...

Also, Tesla has said in official communications with governments that FSD will always be a level 2 driver support."
2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is it wise to underestimate Volkswagen? I will try to keep this short and sweet.
In my view the following points are justifiable:
-The VW emissions hack was not an effort to destroy the environment. 
-It was trolling done by VW officials bc they were tired of having the EPA’s pozzed dick in their asses regarding diesel emission regulations on diesel imports. 
-VW was tired of the EPA because:

     A.  In europe diesel autos make up over half of    
           all car engines. 
     B.  Cars like the Euro-version VW golf wagon      
           get almost 90 mpg. Compare that to the 
           Toyota Prius that gets 40mpg at best. 
     C.  The EPA doesnt want VW to import a 90    
           MPG diesel car to the US because it would    
           kill US auto sales, so the EPA makes diesel 
           regulations so strict that the only diesels 
           VW et. al. can import only manage 45 MPG. 
     D.  And if you want to make things fair, the 
           highest MPG diesel electric hybrid made by 
           VW gets over 200 MPG. 
     E.  Europeans aren’t idiots: they aren’t willingly 
          “poisoning themselves” with diesel fumes. 
          Diesel is just as clean as gas and burning 
          1 gallon of diesel fuel every 90 miles is 
          better for the environment than burning 1 
          gallon of gas every 30 miles. 
     F.  The “smelly/black fume producing” 
          reputation of diesel in america owes itself to 
          idiot US auto makers that in the 80’s tried to 
          make frankenstein diesel engines out of 
          modified gas engines and they ran like shit 
          and spewed black smoke. These atrocities    
          were unlike the clean running diesel engines 
          that were being produced in Germany at the 
          same time. 
-In summary, the EPA has been punishing European Auto makers (VW) for American auto makers’ past engineering disgraces, and when VW officials got tired of being unfairly punished they decided to troll the EPA with an emissions hack. 
-They did it to slam some jimmies, not to gain      
profit or destroy the environment. 
-German authorities know this, which is why they released key players like Oliver Schmidt who was let out on parole right after he was transferred from US prison to German authorities. 
-The loss of stock value that occured from the scandal was unjustified then, and the stagnation of VW stock price since then has been unjustified in light of the fact that VW’s P/E in the last 3 months has been between 50-70 times lower than that of Tesla, and historically it has been foolish to underestimate the ability of Volkswagen to perform at the cutting edge of the industry. 
-The Emissions hack has nothing negative to say about Volkswagens fierce engineering capability and in my view it has something positive to say about the youthfulness and creativity of the company.

2021-05-26 21:37:12,wallstreetbets,"I'd check if that 90mpg is in US gallons or Imperial. For some stupid reason there's a difference. Also European tests are different and tend to yield higher efficiency results.

I haven't looked it up recently, but I recall hearing europeans were moving away from diesel due to particulate emissions. People actually noticed cities getting dirty from it. Although modern direct injection gas engines have similar issues to a lesser degree. 

As for the tesla comparison, their stock valuation doesn't make any sense as a car company. I firmly believe they can be a strong and profitable company, akin to bmw or something. But I wouldn't expect their car sales to make higher profits than Toyota for example.

But I'm just a dumb car nerd who gets excited when I see stocks posts involving cars."

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? Hi Everyone! I did some research on cinema stocks a while back and made a video on it. I didn't post the content here so I thought I would share it as I know everyone is interested in AMC at the moment! I know it's a lot to read so if you prefer to watch the video, the link for that is also included below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNn2bOC1xo&t=6s)

Why Cinema Stocks like AMC will benefit from reopening? 

Time-Frame: Cinema’s will benefit from reopening and the economic recovery that is occurring all over the world. Especially over a longer timeframe.  I think that Cinemas can be a good trade in the medium term and can help you make money. It’s all dependent on data and how quickly things go back to normal, but my timeframe on this trade right now is 1-2 years. Maybe even shorter, perhaps 6 months if we bounce back very quickly. Maybe not the most likely, but still a possible scenario that I have to consider. 

&#x200B;

Thesis: 

1)  The Covid-19 pandemic has had a very strong negative impact on the cinema sector. So, naturally as things reopen and vaccinations increase all over North America, these companies stand to benefit. If we look back from the end of January 2020 to the end of April 2021, Marcus Corporation was down approximately 33% from January 27th, 2020. Cinemark is down approximately 35% over the same time period, while National CineMedia is down almost 42% and AMC is up almost 57%. Price is an important factor to consider when buying and selling stocks and this something that is important to consider 

2) Cinemas have suffered tremendously with the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes the cinema sector intriguing as the world re-opens. If we look to Asia, especially China and Japan, where Covid-19 cases subsided and theatres reopened, things look promising.  There was a substantial increase in demand, with demand actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. In China, December 2020 ticket sales at IMAX’s big-screen theatres jumped 28 per cent from a year earlier, while in Japan, they broke daily records and a record number of people saw movies on the first weekend of January 2021. Clearly, there was a lot of pent-up demand which surfaced and benefitted movie theatres in Asia. 

3) And you know what I’ve seen this film before. Last year early in February, there was a sudden spike in downloads of the Zoom app in China, and the stock at that was point already doing well, up roughly 30 percent from the start of the year. But this spike in Zoom usage soon spread all over the world, and the rest is history. It was an absolutely humungous winner last year. There are obviously sector wide risks with consumer preferences changing, and more and more people preferring to watch films at home. The increase in Netflix & streaming service subscribers over the years is a clear indication of consumer preferences going-forward, but I do like movie theatres as a trade. There is a lot of pent-up demand that I feel will benefit the sector. 

Risks: 

\-  One of the main risks that that most people who are considering trading or investing in cinema companies have, is the risk from Netflix and the other streaming services. Really the risk of the Direct-to-consumer approach and the effects that it will have on the cinema companies. And this is a valid concern because it has reduced demand for cinemas over the last decade. Even some of the biggest filmmakers in the world are turning to it, like Martin Scorsese, Noah Baumbach and Alfonso Cuaron.  Netflix has become the biggest movie studio in the world, at-least when it comes to volume in terms of production over the last several years. And now they plan to release 50-60 films per year, and with their pioneering Direct to Consumer approach, the film industry has changed. Cinemas are no longer at the forefront, and the Direct-to-Consumer strategy is quickly becoming the new incumbent. The DTC approach is taking over, with all the streaming services that have launched. They have taken market share from linear television and have steered consumers away from traditional Cinema.

Catalysts & Conclusion: 

1) However, I still think there is still a place for theatres, even with streaming, especially looking at the same timeframe that I’m focusing on for this trade. I think now more so than ever people want to be outside. These businesses will benefit from the change in near term consumer trends, with everyone wanting to leave the house. I really believe that the cinema sector is going to do well in North America. If Asia is anything to go by and I think it is, some of the companies involved in the sector have the potential to be great trades. People still want to go to the cinemas, especially when it comes to seeing some of the big budget films that are really made for the big screen. Blockbuster action films with awesome effects are really meant to be seen in a movie theatre in my opinion. The effects and the environment simply cannot be replicated at home. Especially when it comes to immersive experience films, like those with IMAX and 4DX. I really enjoy the cinema and think there is something to be said for being in a big space in a dark room watching a film 40 feet across. It is wonderful to sit in the comfort of your own home but there is just something to be said for having a community experience in a room. But that’s neither there nor here. 

  
2) Moving on, another potential catalyst is the potential for collaboration between theatre chains and streaming services. Netflix was the one to pioneer the Direct to Consumer, but interestingly they have begun releasing some Netflix Originals on the big screen in recent years. Films like The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes all premiered in Cinemas prior to their appearance in Netflix’s online catalogue.  This is a really interesting move on their part, especially from an investment perspective. Because, while you can watch streaming services in the comfort of your own home, movie theatre companies are open to the idea of having the films that are produced by the streaming services shown in their theatres. Cinemark has shown Netflix movies in theatres in the past, and there is an off chance that they expand their agreement. This wouldn’t just apply to Cinemark but other theatre chains as well potentially. The big hold-up between the streaming services and theatre chains was the disagreement on the length of theatrical window. But last year, Universal Studios and Cinemark, AMC & Cineplex agreed to a shortened exclusive window, from 74 days to 31 days for major films, as defined by box-office domestic revenue. This makes it more likely that Netflix and other streaming services can find middle ground with the cinema companies. It’s not all that important a catalyst for the trade, nor is it all that likely, but it is still intriguing and something to consider.

3) A more important catalyst is the release of the next James Bond film, no time to die next year. I’m really excited about the movie because I’m a huge James Bond fan. It’s probably my favourite movie series. And you know what, I’m not alone. It’s very popular all over the world. The previous James Bond film, Spectre, grossed nearly $879 million. No Time To Die has been postponed several times due to the pandemic and is due to premiere on October 8th in the United States. I’m really excited about the movie and will be sure to see in theatres provided it’s safe to do so. And I think it will be. This movie is really important for the movie theatres because they have been starved and there have just been very few films to show. They have been supply constrained with the lack of new films. No Time To Die is a certain blockbuster and will really help benefit the sector. 

4) Something else that has me really excited is the recent CDC news in the US, with them updating guidance on April 2nd that fully vaccinated people can travel internationally safely and don’t need to quarantine when they return provided, they test negative within three to five days of their return. They have to test negative before they are allowed to board a return flight to the US. This is really exciting, and this combined with the idea of a vaccine passport as has been proposed by cruise lines and the UK government really provide a lot of momentum for the cinema companies.

You can say demand for movies hasn't changed - I go for the experience, not so much the movie, and that margins are high - but there are a few things working against amc.   
Producers are signing exclusive deals with subscription based platforms, amc can't fully open globally and even of those open, they can't be at max capacity. Also,  atm the only way I can see amc offloading the debt in a quick manner is to basically go against the squeeze and sell their company shares.

The other thing people fail to realize is that during COVID,  because of all the closings they started airing movies on streaming sites and they are continuing to do that alongside theatre releases. Why pay $13-15 for a single ticket and buy overpriced snacks when for $100 a year you can stream all the movies you want and invite all the people you want? 

I think Netflix, HBOmax, and Disney+ are going to cannibalize the theatre industry.

Theatre’s are still going to exist, mainly because people like me will continue to go to them, but I don’t think their profits will be stellar by any means."

I am long Cinemark at the moment as it's my favourite company in the sector, just from a risk-reward perspective. I want to iterate that reopening isn’t company specific trend or theme. It’s a sector theme. I like to generally pick up best of breed, unless there is a special opportunity, so it’s important to look at financials, projections and management, as they’re extremely useful for determining the quality of a business."

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"After 3 years of learning investment: my 5 tips for those who just started I had my fair share of losing money, trading capital drawdowns, busting my own trading capital many times before finally learning from past mistakes to become a better trader and stop do stuff like it's a mf casino.

I don’t want to share with you something that you all heard so many times (yep, I haven't lost my fate in humanity) like avoid margin trading or invest in mutual funds. I believe I have some wisdom I wish I had from the beginning.

1. Trading is just 5% theory and 95% about emotional control, risk and money management, overcoming one’s greed, having strict stoploss and targets predefined before taking a trade.
2. Don’t follow advice from forums blindly. Build your own map of the world. Each of us learn to trade at our own pace and don’t get discouraged if you find that after a few years, you’re still struggling to master the ‘money game’. You can keep in mind different advice from experienced players (e.g. I recommend this qooore app and it's discord community), *but it's vital for the final decision to be yours*.
3. Accept losses and do not make investment decisions based on emotion Especially greed, fear, or panic. Yep, you didn’t buy Betcoin (lol couldn't resist) at 3,000$ because you didn’t know back than what direction the price would take. No regrets. Keep yourself focused on here and now, move ahead
4. Know yourself. What is your current financial situation? Why you are investing? For what purpose the investment is being made? This will automatically answers questions such as how long you are investing for. The other important aspect is how much risk you would normally want to take. Keeping both in mind, assess your risk carefully.
5. Never forget that for investing, time is your best friend - and greed is your worst enemy. Patience is a requirement in stock trading. There are no short-cuts or ‘holy grail’ when it comes to stock. And you only need to have couple of strategies but those should be well tested and made perfect over the period of time.

To me, trading is a skill that requires 3Ls - ‘Life-Long Learning”.

Stay humble, be honest and willing to admit your mistakes in trading and don’t try to rationalise and explain mistakes away, and always remain teachable and never think you’ve ‘arrived’."

2021-05-27 00:45:00,wallstreetbets,"Wish I'd have paid more attention to some of this early, particularly aspects around greed or making decisions logically.

Lost a lot (for me) chasing a couple hundred extra dollars on 25%-30% gains only to reset back to where I was, or worse lose it all.  

Once I figured out how to set stop-loss orders and sell targets, life got a little easier.  I was still kicking myself when a target was much lower than a peak, but that was better than missing the climb totally and it turning into a loss."
2021-05-27 00:47:58,wallstreetbets,Stop loss on unless there's a potential squeeze!  No stop loss for a potential squeeze on a stock! Take stop loss off amc and gme.

2021-05-27 00:22:02,wallstreetbets,">Why you are investing?

Short term, I've been saving up $20k for a truck I want to buy next month. I started investing my truck savings account in February when I realized I wouldn't quite make 20k by June, meaning I was going to need some form of loan. Do I want to pay cash for my truck? Yep. Was it realistic? Only if I could find another 3-5 thousand dollars between February and June. And if I lost some or broke even, I'd need a loan. Fuck, if I'd lost it all I would have signed a lease for the truck I need. But I wanted to pay cashola and no payments.

So I thought fuck it, let's see if I can pull this off. Well yesterday I wiped out all my learning mistakes worth of losses on one big green day (thanks amc!) and today pulled ahead toward my target by $1800. Unrealized. Because I'm not there yet! So I'm letting my amc ride. Worst case scenario is I'm leasing a truck next month. Conservative best case is buying it with money to spare (actual best case I guess would be gme and amc to the mother fucking moon and I'm buying a new house to park my new truck in).

Lfg!"

Started out investing with a long-term vision, then realised early this year that the approach I have been using has changed over time and was not really aligning with my goals. This definitely showed from the performance of my holdings. It seems like in a way controlling our emotions and knowing ourselves are linked together, as we have a firm idea of why we are investing and the style that suits our goals, it could be easier to control ourselves and limit the rash decisions that we make."

The difference was the some were given an additional rope...before and were able to raise more money.

We had no idea which would survive their grow at all costs stage and survive to the profit stage.

You can go down the road of trying to make lots of bets on a bunch of individual stocks (but that means the first YOLO bet that goes south will sink you until you can save up again).  Or you buy a managed fund, or go for diversity and buy an total market type of index fund.

2) You need a certain high level of fitness to survive a high altitude or space environment. Who knows as well, maybe there will be some new technology to make these space vehicles or structures easily habitable for normal people.

2021-05-26 22:15:45,wallstreetbets,"Sure. The more I think of it, the more it makes sense to me. Amazon, Apple, Netflix and others had in common that they were setting themselves to take over their markets and create new ones, but many thought they were not going to be where they are now. 

I know the tokens are already hyped and what not, but if someone can democratize the ownership of goods digitally, you get rid of titles of property, licenses, certificates of ownership, receipts, invoices, diplomas, cards, etc. That sounds way ahead but it will destroy entire industries and associations that we shouldn't have 10 years from now.

All we need is a decent life.

Maybe invent something, attend most family events, spend more time with loved ones, care for one another and help people around you in need of help... 

A “lambo” is just a meme for me and probably many others... paying off mortgage and credit cards and stuff like that is big deal... not having to worry about going bankrupt for some stupid illness as well. 

As for me, lambo is not even in the list of things I would like to have if I make a lot of money. A decent life opportunity is."

2021-05-27 14:56:29,wallstreetbets,"I don't pay trillions in taxes. I don't know that you do, but I suspect the price tax is south of your income. I think you have to compare your servies to your expenditures and ask yourself if someone offered you clean water, water on demand utilities on demand, what is that worth to you I think you would be willing to pay more then you are currently. I am being a little bit facetious but in reality the tax to services of most areas is kinda awesome. Is there corruption and incompetence yes. But that is true of any place where people are, which doens't mean we should accept it. My point is if you are willing to pay $7.00 for netflix your taxes as a services can be viewed the same way. Personally in Ohio for my bill i'm kinda fine with my tax to service ratio."

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cramer said…. CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Wednesday he’s not sure why any investors are still betting against GameStop and AMC Entertainment, two of the so-called meme stocks popular on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum.
.
.
The “Mad Money” host made his comments following a session in which GameStop shares rose almost 16% Wednesday and AMC advanced 19%. The stocks are up 37% and more than 60%, respectively, this week alone as the speculative trading that took first Wall Street by storm in January resumed.
.
.
“Anyone shorting AMC or GameStop is out of their mind. ... WallStreetBets is too powerful and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,” Cramer said.
.
.
Despite some optimism around a potential turnaround spearheaded by Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, Cramer contended the video-game retailer GameStop remains way overvalued. AMC — which still faces headwinds from the rise of digital streaming — is also expensive at current levels, Cramer said.
.
.
But Cramer the companies are not trading based on fundamentals, which makes shorting their stocks dangerous as long as they remain beloved by Reddit traders.
.
.
Shorting a stock is essentially a bet that it will fall in price. An investor such as a hedge fund borrows shares and then immediately sells them into the market, with the goal of buying them back later at a lower level. Then, the investor returns the borrowed shares, profiting off the price differential.
.
.
When the opposite happens and the stock rises in value, a short-seller may seek to minimize losses by purchasing shares at their higher price.
.
.
Both GameStop and AMC have over 20% of their float shares sold short, according to data from S3 Partners. That’s compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock.
.
“I’ve never seen anything like this: a group of buyers with no sensitivity to price,” Cramer said. “These people don’t have unlimited firepower, but they’ve got enough firepower to engineer a short-squeeze any time a bunch of professionals decide to bet against this thing.”
.
.
“These people don’t have unlimited firepower…”
.
.
I believe Cramer has never met the INTERNET!!!!!!"

I think many people don’t get that nothing is black and white and likely there isn’t a single person they should follow and trust indefinitely."
2021-05-26 22:39:52,wallstreetbets,Na bro. SNDL is the way. Buy it and thank me later.
2021-05-26 22:18:20,wallstreetbets,He said in a recent interview that he goes to bed at 11pm and wakes up at 3am every day. I think it's sleep deprivation.
2021-05-26 20:45:43,wallstreetbets,"He did strike me as a little mental, maby it just a case of multiple personalities."
2021-05-27 17:09:32,wallstreetbets,"He Is A FAKE....

2021-05-26 20:08:50,wallstreetbets,"Author here


Your anger misleads you don't trust it. You don't see what I was trying to do cuz you don't read the tiny print that explains exactly what I tried to do. I tried to lock in a sell order for today's price if a predicted plummet occurs tomorrow and then I tried to see who can explain to me why I'm not allowed to do it this way. 


I earned a free silver award today and I already awarded it to the person that did exactly that. You may be an ape but you are a blind ape. Help those who need it from here on out so we all have tendies"
2021-05-26 21:01:50,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-26 20:01:33,wallstreetbets,The definitions of the words are not matching up with my brain I think because of my dyslexia or other learning disability.
2021-05-26 20:02:00,wallstreetbets,I was led to believe that the way it's set up is how it reads at the bottom in the fine print exclaiming what I want done. It says I want to sell it for today's price if tomorrow it drops 10% or more
2021-05-27 07:25:32,wallstreetbets,Did you not read the screenshot before lashing out at me?
2021-05-26 20:02:16,wallstreetbets,"Dude, it's a useless order so it prevents you from thinking you put in a stop loss that *won't work*.

If you want to do a limit sell, do a LIMIT SELL not a stop loss.

Stop loss: trigger price (eek the stock dropped to my scaredy price) and the limit is the lowest you'll accept before you miss the drop entirely (become a bag holder). If your limit is higher than your trigger, the thing would literally *never* fire."
2021-05-26 20:10:50,wallstreetbets,You okay?
2021-05-26 20:09:16,wallstreetbets,"If $218 is the lowest you want to sell for, set the stop at $225 (or something) then the limit at $218. Your sell order trigger once the price dips below $225, and will fill no lower than $218. 

Don’t take my word for it though, I habitually lose money like the rest of WSB"
2021-05-27 02:47:40,wallstreetbets,"You were not ""led to believe"" anything of the sort. This is your ignorance, and it's on you.

It's also fucking stupid to believe anything works like that."
2021-05-26 20:04:49,wallstreetbets,Your anger misleads you don't trust it. You don't see what I was trying to do cuz you don't read the tiny print that explains exactly what I tried to do. I tried to lock in a sell order for today's price if a predicted plummet occurs tomorrow
2021-05-26 20:07:28,wallstreetbets,The apps vernacular led me to believe that I could set a stop limit order that would lock in today's price if tomorrow it plummets
2021-05-27 01:05:43,wallstreetbets,Or did you not read that in the image?
2021-05-26 20:14:13,wallstreetbets,"Naw not really, so before I die I wanna see apes come together in kindness to share wisdom so none of us miss the tendieman anymore. The apps vernacular did confuse the shit out of me to have me think it would let me lock in today's price if tomorrow it plummets. I consider that to be a seedy micro trick shitadel and them Are pulling on retail traders using all of these conveniently free apps"
2021-05-26 20:00:06,wallstreetbets,"Suppose it only goes down 3% instead of 10% and then rockets up 500%? I wouldn't want to sell then but if it drops 10% and then 20% and then 30%, then yeah I would want to lock in the current price to sell if I watch it drop 10% or more"
2021-05-26 20:11:52,wallstreetbets,"That's why I went to endeavor such a feat of intellectual conversation. There are many angry Apes but there are a few calm helpful Apes and that is enough.

Meanwhile I need to submit a work order ticket to the app cuz the vernacular it used made me believe that I could use the stop limit order process to lock in today's price if tomorrow it dips like a bitch"
2021-05-27 07:24:46,wallstreetbets,You're a vile piece of shit who doesn't understand what the fuck my words were saying this entire time. Go read the screenshot at the bottom you dumbass
2021-05-26 20:20:21,wallstreetbets,"No, you're still confused.

If that's what you want, set your trigger at $240 and your limit at $217.

Then if it dips to 240, your broker will execute a limit order at 217, and you'll get the best price it can find you as long as that price is 217 or higher. Then when it recovers and rips, you won't get any of the tendies, just like you want. 🧻🤲 can get off the rocket.

Even easier - sell at premarket open. It will be within a dollar of the AH closing price."
2021-05-26 20:08:20,wallstreetbets,"Could send a support ticket and advise them of your confusion so they can address it, I find most apps are open to suggestions"
2021-05-27 00:15:16,wallstreetbets,"So in your mind someone will give you the higher price for the stock if it opens lower, just because you ""locked in"" a limit order? That's not how stops work, they are to sell a stock at the price below the stop price, that's why it's known as a stop loss. You are stopping further losses by selling at a price a few cents below your stop. 

If you could just enter whatever price the stock was at previously no matter what it's at now, the entire market would collapse because price movement means nothing."
2021-05-27 15:15:47,wallstreetbets,"That's not some random vernacular the app developers decided on.  It's standard market vernacular that strictly adheres to financial law.  You probably won't get the explanation that you need in this subreddit or from that support ticket you were talking about submitting.  I *would* suggest that you read the definitions of that vernacular on investopedia, *but* I'm not confident you're capable of comprehending it without *a lot* of help."
2021-05-26 20:17:56,wallstreetbets,"Edumucate yourself before hitting any buy/sell orders on any brokerage pal. Really isn’t too difficult to pick up but it does take time, plenty of great material out there. If I could read I would offer to help but unfortunately I learn through sniffing glue and rolling in grass"
2021-05-27 08:21:28,wallstreetbets,">why would an entity(the broker or buyer) guarantee to sell for u @ higher price after market plummets, FREE of Charge?  
>  
>You can insure it by buying a put option , but the seller of said option make u bleed thru the nose for it.  
>  
>  
>  
>There are no free guarantees in life. Please wake up."
2021-05-27 07:24:07,wallstreetbets,"You're confused on my post meaning. I did this because it would not allow me to do this because of what it's vernacular lays out right in the picture.

I showed that this app is trying to create false knowledge of how shit works. 🤷‍♂️ It's just more hedgy fuckery"
2021-05-26 20:24:14,wallstreetbets,It told me if I do it that way then it'll sell the stocks at 217 instead of today's price of $240
2021-05-26 20:10:15,wallstreetbets,"You deserve an award my fellow ape, for you are way more kind than the others"
2021-05-27 01:01:05,wallstreetbets,Do you see now why a ticket to WeBull is warranted? They are giving financial advice that leads the average retail investor to believe the wrong thing
2021-05-27 01:01:26,wallstreetbets,Or perhaps they meant to do this in order to cause Mass confusion to the smoothest brains
2021-05-27 01:04:46,wallstreetbets,"It's actually spelled EdJuMiKaTe but m'kay 

I was taught this way by the WeBull app vernacular. Instead of thinking what you thought originally, consider submitting a work order ticket to WeBull so that they know that their app is teaching people wrongly very bigly.
It's like you didn't read the entire image"
2021-05-27 10:11:49,wallstreetbets,"Take your last sentence away and you made a pretty significant contribution to this discussion.

Again for the final time - LoOk & ReAd dA ImAgE. It led me to believe the opposite of what the fuck a trade in this way is, because citadel is fucking with us by manipulating the apps to train people wrongly and I am just trying to point that fucking out instead of finding out just how fucking angry and toxic other Apes can be!"
2021-05-27 10:23:24,wallstreetbets,It won't let you set a stop loss that can't possibly work. I hope you sold your amc 5 minutes into open today 😉
2021-05-26 20:12:49,wallstreetbets,"Always happy to help! We all have the same goal, secure those profits!"
2021-05-27 16:11:02,wallstreetbets,"I'm not angry, just that your confusion is confusing me is all...

Hope this helps: 7:35 is where they explain stop limit sell orders.

Edit: actually, you should probably watch the whole video..."
2021-05-26 20:00:31,wallstreetbets,But then it would really sell and I would lose if it goes up in the next few days instead of goes down and down and down in the next few days
2021-05-26 20:00:53,wallstreetbets,I would rather bookmark and save today's price to sell at this price if it goes down by whatever day
2021-05-26 20:02:14,wallstreetbets,"You can’t set it like that tho, if it goes down you can only sell for the price it goes down to, you can’t “lock in” a higher sell price. So pick an amount you’re comfortable with if it dips and set that as your value. Then it won’t sell unless it dips to your set price"
2021-05-26 20:03:20,wallstreetbets,"So it's not the app, it's the app misleading me in the way it's using its own vernacular......... A completely different issue that the app owners need to be made aware of"

2021-05-27 10:26:57,wallstreetbets,Exactly! About to post update
2021-05-26 20:10:52,wallstreetbets,Why would you get an award for this nonsense? Don't be a bitch. Sell your calls only to buy stock.
2021-05-26 23:08:21,wallstreetbets,I’ll be honest I’m looking to get into options as that seems to be the way to go with returns. I don’t anticipate holding onto any one investment vehicle for more than a year
2021-05-26 23:36:31,wallstreetbets,"I hav'nt sold either.. Why?? Because the short squeeze Has NOT begun contrary to false information.this is simply retail investors buying massive amounts.There are only around 250000 to three hundred thou left.I think the squeeze may begin tomorrow.trust me.you have seen nothing..when the squeeze occurs it will go parabolic.there won't be a gain of 2 bucks a day, it will shoot straight up..Hold on.set a stop limit depending on where you bought..This is a rare occurrence , use the stock tools to stay safe but enjoy the ride."
2021-05-27 11:34:20,wallstreetbets,Lies!

2021-05-26 20:11:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this smells like bullshit. 

Who the fuck fomos 700k at this point. This story has been out for 5 months. You either believe the DD and are already invested or you believe the DD is a bunch of bagholder conspiracy theorists.

2021-05-27 08:08:49,wallstreetbets,Would a trade done by the broker off the exchange show up? Brokerages like ETrade do that right—fill orders by moving shares between clients?

2021-05-26 20:07:50,wallstreetbets,yea... like what was this guy doing when GME was sitting at $180 just a few days ago? or bouncing between $140-170 for weeks? lol
2021-05-26 21:29:37,wallstreetbets,What if it  explodes again up to $300 tomorrow ? Then it was the dip

Shorts make pretendie tendies thinking we will hold bags and plan to buy it back when cheaper. Problem is that they’ve made so many synthetics, they didn’t factor in millions of people just holding for the sake of holding, because banana.
They can’t buy their shit back - retail alone holds more shares than real shares exist."

2021-05-26 22:52:26,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-26 22:34:28,wallstreetbets,OP bought the entirety of the top today. Literally chopped the peak off and put it in his portfolio.
2021-05-26 21:44:27,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t make any sense. This is a fake trade.

I thought the same until I saw his YOLO 4 months (120d) back when GME was at $147. Could be a reinvestment after selling his profits"

In that span of time they got a new chairman, new CFO, looking for a new CEO, put more stock into the market without tanking the price, and cleared their debt.

They raised some additional funding, but the same forces that sent them to bankruptcy will send them back to bankruptcy. The entire business model is done. You fools don’t even realize the the estimated sales you’re purchasing at those prices. You’re paying more today than GameStop in its PRIME back in 2006, nearly DOUBLE, yet sales are nearly 50% less and profits are down 70%. 

They will drain cash and end up in bankruptcy again. People buy games from the console. People buy consoles from Walmart. fundamentals always play out in the long run. Holiday earnings were the weakest since 2005, and that was after the hype. Q1 results will be negative, and will get worse over time. All you did was buy them a little more time.

I’m finding out that the medical establishment pushes it on a lot of mothers too. One person on this thread said when she had her boys they immediately started asking her when she wanted to schedule doing it. She had to yell at them to stop asking.  Only one doctor in the room agreed with the mom. But the biggest determining factor is if the dad had it done to themselves when they were born.  In the   50s 60s and maybe 70s, many places didn’t even ask, they just immediately did it. That’s when it was happening all over the world, so many people having kids in the 80s and 90s had it done to them without choice from the parents and now they’re having kids of their own. But I think the internet has given rise to people not doing it now. But it still happens."

Nowhere in your reply did answer why. It’s a stock that has hype. I don’t understand the animosity from people like you. More people are making money than losing it(so far at least). 

So I ask, again, why are you personally so bothered by the stock? What about it pisses you off so much? You commented a LOT on it.

Edit: I never said hype outweighs business. It just seemed like the company is not going to get bankrupt. I don’t have that much GME stock. But I’d like to make a little bit of money lol and your analysis assumes they have the same business model. We don’t really KNOW what they’re new business model is yet.

Performance can only be measured through the entire cycle.    The entire Cycle exposes you from all angles. 

The human brain tends to become infected with greed at the end of a big Stage 2 run (see digital  virtuals  for current example) thus causing people to lose money after a bull market because they expect it to go on forever.

  Understanding Stage Analysis can help you overcome this  

&#x200B;

So now let's  dig in our today's post and my targets  : 

1-  Silver will enjoy huge capital flows from those digital assets  holders in a time after overcame and understand stage analysis .... who will now seek the silver whale! 

&#x200B;

2- We are in stage 2 for silver  !!! We can expect parabolic moves any time .  

 Opportunity of buying silver cheap and timely is about to end. 

 Silver has never failed to reach it's ALL-TIME highs after gold does it first.  ( gold did it 2020 July ) 

So, it's not a questions of IF... but WHEN?  

Tic Toc !

&#x200B;

3-  Silver is in a position of strength. US Dollar is in a position of weakness. 

 The final 15% decline in the US Dollar index WILL send silver parabolic! 

https://preview.redd.it/yw2p6xjadj171.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e9da9e4bc30073c962b9fac61ed2ab9e7fdfdfe

&#x200B;

4-  The ""silver"" macro tidal wave is picking up steam &will crush all price suppression along the way...  Q2 close will set the stage how fast the insanity picks up.  HOLD ON TIGHT! Easy 56$ and 120$ targets 

This is not financial advice . I hold 1700 ozz of physical silver ."

\*Memes took over. Congrats to the Apes who played the memes.

# TA Notes: 

* Bulls couldn't even overcome the test of 419.64. We reached a high of 419.61.
* This was listed as a small test possibility in last night's post.
* We bounced from the 20 SMMA on the 65m intraday.

* If you were a bull, today was another perfect dip buy as we bounced off the support level. I did think we might test the 120 SMMA but we didn't :)
* We didn't post a lower low or a higher high.

# 5/27 Outlook

Today's price 🎯 still hold for tomorrow. *(theta starting to take away some of my credibility if I have to keep moving these targets back...)*

Note from [Spot Gamma](https://spotgamma.com/): *""We are looking for another low volatility session tomorrow with 4200 being the key area in play. Low VIX/implied vol could start to add a tailwind to equities as options decay and dealers buy back short hedges.""*

Could positive unemployment numbers and leading economic index reading give SPY the tailwind it needs to reach ATH?

https://preview.redd.it/9mmpvyivgj171.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=8683cd4be101b95f5cf1826252b93c56d733e8df

* If 420.73 breaks, look for bullish 🎯 : 422.43 - 423.81 - 425.15
* If 417.25 breaks, look for bearish 🎯 : 416 - 415 - 414.13 - 412.74 - 411.26 - 410
* Please not that if we push below 415 we could see downwards pressure to 405.

2021-05-27 07:04:05,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah. I bought puts as soon as I saw bullish momentum stall and it confirmed below VWAP. Always nice to lock in a 20% gain to start the day.

Seems like he thinks today will move just as sideways as yesterday did, depending on if unemployment numbers have a factor on the stock or not. If so, the stock will probably plummet. Of course, I could be completely wrong."

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"First real post on WSB - found a walking zombie 🧟 and wanted to share... I bring you a tale of.... $VSAT Redoing this because I tried to emulate instead of innovate -

TLDR --Premise-- ViaSat, Inc (VSAT) is a mediocre company that provides mediocre satellite service that costs way too much for what it is.... but in many places it is the ONLY option... well it was until Mr. 🚀 himself decided to eat their lunch. StarLink (part of SpaceX) is about to absolutely destroy VSAT and turn it to 💩.

TLDR --Strategy-- since you can't invest in SpaceX (private company) or Starlink (until it is spun off into a separate entity **and then DO invest there** ) I think someone that decides to buy PUTS on VSAT (give yourself A LOT of time, I'm talking June 2022 $35 or Jan 2023 $25) stands to make a lot of money ------ I'm personally not starting my position until right before the next earnings report in August. I figure the first sign of trouble will come out in an earnings report and if it isn't August then by November it'll start showing. Again **LONG** duration puts. Looking to catch that cycle when the company drops 50% on the bad news. If it goes up between now and then I'll just buy MORE puts. 

**NOT A PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL PERSON - INVEST AT YOUR OWN RISK - I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE BUT I MAY BE 🤪🤪🤪🤪 PERSON WHO EATS 💩 FOR ALL YOU KNOW**

details

**ViaSat - How it started**

Market cap of 3.26 Billion, share price of $47.55 when I'm writing this. It got as high as the 90's before the pandemic book the shins out of the market and dropped it to $28. Since recovered a bit to... as I said $47.55

They have some satellites in space that allow people with a receiver dish to get internet from space like some kind of awesome scifi movie.... except the internet is crazy expensive for what you get. Their satellites are pretty high up and that means each one can cover a BIG area. They only seem to have a handful, maybe a dozen? But they offer pretty broad coverage and are expanding it. BUT because the satellites are high up the latency (time between your computer and your internet source or something like that) is high leading to slow speeds and overall not a great service.

They already have airlines as customers, expanding recently with Delta. Their is VERY LITTLE competition in this business and between airlines, cruise lines and rural home owners with no other option they make a nice amount of money. Totally solid business model. Internet is ever more and more important and usage on air planes and boats is only gonna go up. In fact like a lot of articles on VSAT I would probably say this is a good medium / long term buy and that is why the median price target is $67 ***EXCEPT*** I know something that the market doesn't seem to have realized yet.

>EDITED BASED ON COMMENTS  
>  
>ViaSat does have commercial business beyond airlines and cruises; I would imagine rural businesses and some VERY LARGE corporations that use it for specific use cases. There is also the DOD which they have contracts with.  
>  
>  
>  
>**I AM NOT ASSERTING THAT VIA SAT WILL GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS.**  
>  
>  
>  
>However, while a viable company may exist beyond the coming reckoning I expect the market to react extremely negatively to ViaSat losing **ALL** of their rural residential and rural small and medium size business customers. I'm also thinking that right around the time that starts sinking in news stories about cruise lines and air lines switching over to StarLink will start popping up and again, $VSAT go **💩.** I honestly hope VSAT does go up to the current target of the mid $60's because I'll start buying puts a small chunk at a time as it rises. Until then I'm waiting till August, right before next quarterly earnings report to start my position.

**StarLink - How it's going**

as you may the Dogefather happens to have a small 🚀 company. Its called SpaceX and they aren't publicly traded. They also are doing to the aerospace / orbit supply and transport industry what many of us wish Tesla could fully due to the fossil fuel industry. SpaceX's Falcon9 🚀 is all sorts of amazing - mainly because it isn't thrown out after each use ($40MM in savings for each subsequent use of a booster).

StarLink is a division of SpaceX that is focused on bringing internet to the whole 🌎 using a crazy amount of satellites. Like... A LOT. Unlike ViaSat which has a few the StarLink constellation (thats what they call a network of satellites) has 16 HUNDRED and they are launching 60 at a time every week or so (sometimes more than once a week). Because StarLink has access to this game changing super cheap 🚀 transportation AND Musk is doing is usual weirdness by mass producing these satellites and focusing on cost and volume instead of making them SUPER DUPER reliable

Some of you may remember how TSLA was this tiny company that was prob gonna die etc. etc. and THEN 💥💥 there are Model 3's and Model Y's EVERYWHERE. Well StarLink is gonna have that moment soon. Sometime in the next few months there will suddenly be high-ish speed internet (between 50mbs and 100mbs) literally ANYWHERE on the planet for $500 down and $100 a month. Way better product and on an annualized basis way better value."

2021-05-27 17:46:42,wallstreetbets,"A name like Viasat is more likely to get acquired than they are to go out of business. These institutions don't go out of business overnight - you'd be surprised by the level of stickiness internet service providers have with both commercial and residential customers (""if it ain't broke don't fix it""). Viasat is offering 50+ mbps in plenty of places and to the average user that's more than enough (I'm a gig internet person myself, but have plenty of very intelligent friends who just go for the cheapest speed in their apartment / house). Those are valuable accounts for any potential acquirer - the isp game is really just a land grab at the end of the day"
2021-05-27 17:48:00,wallstreetbets,Nailed it. The ISP game is a land grab at the end of the day. And isp customers are notoriously sticky. Viasat is much more likely to get acquired than they are to go out of business / fail

2021-05-27 09:49:25,wallstreetbets,it totally might run up 50% before coming back down. I just see a really strong likelihood that one of the upcoming quarterly reports is gonna show a huge drop in revenue. At minimum you have 3 months till the next ER

I don't think the OP wants or plans to buy it for 40 but the play seems to be that as the price goes up, the ""value"" (what he could sell it for/what it would cost someone else to buy it) of the option increases. As of the time of the post, the value per share went from $0.50 to $1.15 (so the options he paid $250 for, he could sell for $575, hence the $325 profit). The closer the AMC prices gets to 40 the more the options will be worth because the greater the chances it goes above 40 and ends up in the money for the call holder (e.g. a $40 call when stock is $35 is going to cost a lot more then when stock is $15 and a long shot to ever get to $40). If I understand this correctly, and noob here so just learning how options strategies work, the play is to sell it before it expires and take the profits from selling the call option, not to hope it gets above $40 and exercise the option.  Similarly, with the $15 call - which cost more than 3x to buy (i.e. 1.55 vs. 0.50), the ""value"" of the call option has already increased to $6.15 (an increase of $4.60 per share or $4,600 per option contract since 1 option is 100 shares). OP has 115 contracts (11,500 shares) and so the profit he could get right now from selling the option contracts is $4.60 x 11,500 (which is what the $52,900 represents).  In simpler terms, you buy a call option, hope the stock goes way up, thereby increasing the cost of the same call option, and sell that option before it expires and take the profit.  IF I'M WRONG SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME - DOING THIS MORE TO SEE IF I UNDERSTAND THIS."

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A Deep Fucking Value: Why BB is More Than Just a Short Squeeze; And Why It’s Worth $100 A Share First off. Forget that Blackberry is a phone company. Blackberry is a growth late stage start up that utilizes the logistics and patents of an old phone company

Black berry’s forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let’s start with IVY and QNX

QNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It’s essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars’ software 

IVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla’s self driving cars, they’ll all be clamoring for IVY

Cylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It’s confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015

Deep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It’s cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.

That’s $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)

This stock is a deep fucking value"

2021-05-27 06:58:54,wallstreetbets,"QNX/IVY aside, I'm long on BB because I feel that insurance companies will start to play hardball with their customer base if they want to get or maintain cybersecurity or IoT insurance coverage.

My company was recently ""forced"" by the insurance company to upgrade their cybersecurity in order to continue getting coverage following a recent hack.

I foresee this will become increasingly common. A good parallel here is the insurance/body shop networks in the collision space (e.g. we recommend you use THESE guys.) Even if it's a sliver of the market, it should yield returns given the small market cap.

That and the fact cybersecurity will be core to the independent functioning of society as I envision it in the foreseeable."
2021-05-27 15:16:57,wallstreetbets,Nothing here is new. Fact is American predatory shorts are influenced by big tech and waging a decade old war on this Canadian no fail company. There is more to this then what u see on the surface.

2021-05-27 05:30:55,wallstreetbets,The problem is where is the money.  Machine Learning model performance doesn't lead to good cash flow.  The only way to make money here is to sell the data to someone who can use it and monetize it.  So is BB really the play here?

2021-05-27 01:32:22,wallstreetbets,BB calls with a $15 strike and 6/11 expiry only cost $16. Just saying.
2021-05-26 23:46:45,wallstreetbets,I could see that. Keep in mind their shareholders meeting is coming up around then and there will be some tasty news they'll be sharing.
2021-05-26 23:18:47,wallstreetbets,They've been actively working on increasing awareness through marketing that they are no longer a phone company. Chen said during earnings call they recognize this is a challenge they're overcoming right now
2021-05-27 08:44:10,wallstreetbets,They have been doing so for several years now. Probably not as obvious as the majority of their revenue come from B2B services rather than B2C products. Been holding since 11$ and going LOOONG.
2021-05-26 23:20:29,wallstreetbets,I have $11 cc and I think it will get hit. I also got PLTR $23 CC and it’s going to get hit. My timing as usual is fucking precious

2021-05-27 07:05:52,wallstreetbets,"40-50 is my PT, but I would not be surprised if they get bought by Amazon, Apple or some other company that wants into the EV market. This DD did not include the incredible MOAT that Chen is quietly building right now, look at his past successes, it was the same strategy and worked."
2021-05-27 05:11:52,wallstreetbets,"I think it's a good idea if you needed to release an app for an EV. The problem it's solving is that each car is almost like a different operating system, Tesla = macOS, Mercedes = Windows, BMW = Linux. Because all the car sensors could be classified differently by the manufacturers it makes it difficult for app developers to widely release something for all EVs, even if the cars are using the same OS for their computer, since something like ""brake pressure"" could be called ""BP sensor"" or ""BP"" depending on the manufacturer

Ivy will standardise all of this for you don't need to come up with all the different terms for it yourself. It is a very good idea for both those that are aggregating data for analysis, and those that was to build apps and services for cars

So it will lead to 'smarter' cars through third parties making more tools and apps, though I don't know the intricacies of how it'll lead to more revenue going forward for AWS and Blackberry - whether it'll be simply $x per car, or whether AWS will build an ecosystem around it, like what they do for their other products like S3, Cloudfront, EC2; with developers and analysts paying to use its APIs - like how Apple gets a cut from anything on the App Store. So two revenue streams, one from car manufacturers, one from 3rd parties"
2021-05-27 08:25:03,wallstreetbets,"I think insurance companies will pay a lot of money to obtain this type of information. This machine can tell you a lot about people's driving habits, which can help formulate better pricing models for insurance companies."
2021-05-27 05:33:57,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you, I think it's a good idea, but i'm thinking it'll be Amazon getting the revenue from 3rd party app developers/those that want to do analysis"
2021-05-26 20:00:37,wallstreetbets,lol that's funny

2021-05-26 23:28:01,wallstreetbets,"Where do you guys come up with this crap? lol .. Canada would allow it.. now if it was the Chinese buying it I would agree. If Apple, Amazon or Prim Watson were to buy it... it would happen. Canada may have socialized system of healthcare but the stock market isn't part of it. This is why it's called a "" free market economy ""  The feds don't own Blackberry and they can't prevent a private company from being sold in this manner unless it was Huawei wanting it ( and that would be due to the fact that Canada is part of the Five Eyes.) So please get your facts straight. BB isn't some fucking nationally loved emblem like maple syrup, a beaver or er....Nickelback. Ok Ok... A I do believe that the Canadian Government would allow Nickelback to be sold I admit that and they would allow the Chinese to buy them... but that's it.


If Rogers can buy out Shaw and fuck over all Canadians out of better competition for internet and cell phone prices they certainly wouldn't have a problem with BB being sold to Fairfax, Apple or Amazon considering that any of those organizations would keep some offices and employees in Canada and to which Im sure none of those companies would have any issue with. Why? because Canada would offer any of those companies tax incentives to keep some jobs here and they ( the companies ) would without them probably, Why? because Toronto/Kitchener and Montreal are great tech hubs and have some very smart people working here. None of those companies would snap up BB and just get the hell out of dodge. 


At any rate there would be a higher chance of Helen Keller coming over and cooking me a four course meal with Beyonce, Jay-Z and fucking Stevie Wonder next week than there would be of Canada not allowing BB to be sold."

Fuckin' premiums on BB are legit dogshit, and I say that as someone who's been selling 3 covered calls for a piddly $3/week for a hot minute on BB.

Thankfully I stopped when GME started being interesting again, so now I'm just waiting for a $15-$20 to hop off the boat with tendies and hop back in with a larger position after the GME fuckery dies down."

Institutions who own shares sell options to retards. Retards give them 10% premiums on OTM monthlies lol. 

They are loading the boat on ensuring this undervalued stock remains undervalued because people like you are willing to bet it's undervalued instead of just buying the undervalued asset. When the retards stop buying options or it because grossly undervalued, they let it ride and they dump their shares for another 100% return."

Careers are like relationships. If wonders, suspicions, and doubts become an all too recurrent theme - about whether it is worth your emotional investment, the weight and duration of your efforts, the disappointments, the sacrifices, the tedious lulls to the unnerving volatility or the mere passage of time; the heart of heart already knows the answer. There will be mornings where you wander aimlessly in a hopium haze of desperation, believing that desperation alone can somehow improve your circumstances. A cocktail of hope and fear becomes your only exit strategy. But on those occasions, the anchors of inertia will remind you that nothing has changed and that the cement on your boots are congealing quickly. If there is no learning, growth or progress; if you can’t see a directed path along your future trajectory; if you are constantly dwelling on missed opportunities of the past while sheepishly eyeing every other greener pasture, the heart knows that it was an engagement that should have ended as a hapless summer romance, at best."

2021-05-26 21:51:03,wallstreetbets,"a newbie asked for ""thoughts on AMC"" so I'll post it here:

AMC is pure dogshit. GME has a legit future, so I'm not shitting on every meme stonk here (I've made a killing on GME in the second run-up and may yet still on this one) But this is about amc so here you are, assholes: 

How AMC is listed on a stock exchange is beyond me. Its book value per share is negative 5. negative. That's impossible for a listed company, yet there it is, traded publicly. It's debt is twice its market cap. TWICE. So even if it did a stock buyback it wouldn't' be able to dent that debt, which is charging high interest. And maybe that's not terrible \[narrator: that's horrible\] but to crawl out of debt it needs revenue, and it's annual revenue is negative 1.2 billion, so it rolls into more debt, and interest rates go up. Oh, but the pandemic is liftin! Look, it had zero way out of bankruptcy BEFORE the pandemic. So even if it were to sell out every seat in every shitty movie theater for the next 3 years it would still be completely bankrupt. It's not just dogshit, it's warm dogshit smeared inside an old tire in the middle of a raging tire fire. But you could have easily looked all of this up in 3 seconds on yahoo finance or any brokerage account, so you're retarded if you need this much help, and deserve to buy it. Enjoy! hope you get in at the peak like every other fucking idiot on here. 

(hey, I love going to the movie theater, and I'd love to save AMC, but it's not happening. This sub is about making money, not losing it trying to prop up a bankrupt company. There's cheaper ways to join a cult but if it's AMC you want, go to the AMC sub.)"

Amazing. So far, this whole week has been a bulls week. Tuesday was just a small set-back. AMC all the way. So close to $20. Patience has paid off and AMC keeps going up. I’m still holding on to my AMC shares. Since job report comes out tomorrow morning, and the futures look a little red, I bought a $2,432 put on GOOG. GOOG has been going up like crazy.

2021-05-26 21:25:05,wallstreetbets,On the meme stock short squeezers. They know the attempted play. They’ve known for months. They shorted high last time. Probably bought the dip and road back up. Covered their shorts for a profit before it got too high. After the next short report that shows low short interest they’ll short the hell out of it at the top again and dump their shares triggering a retail sell off because the squeeze is over... at least until the next short report and everyone thinks they haven’t learned. They’ve had ample warning and aren’t gonna get caught with their pants down on the same stocks again. I’m sure they’ll be profiting off the retail group think the whole way. May as well just send your money straight to them.

2021-05-26 23:58:18,wallstreetbets,"Credit goes to u/TheGreatPoopFarmer for a gift from OG WSB I found in my saved posts. It seems relevant in these dire times:

Stocks only go up

This economic data looks grim, I think to myself. This is the right move. I look to the cracked screen of my iPhone 5s. A single 6/19 SPY 200p. I take a deep breath, and swipe up to submit the order. As RobinHood's little animation shows the order completing, I suddenly black out.

I come to in a gray room, fluorescent lights humming above. I'm upright in a metal chair, restrained, with my arms and legs zip-tied. The only feature in the room is what I assume to be a Bloomberg Terminal in front of me (I've never seen one in real life). There's so many screens. It looks so professional. A dizzying array of charts, numbers and symbols light up its dozen monitors. In the center, the S&P 500. 2700. Out of its bear market.

I hear several sets of heavy footsteps approaching behind me. I try to look, but can't move much. I sense several burly men standing over my shoulders. To my surprise, Jerome Powell steps in front of me. I try to speak up but he cuts me off. ""What am I-""

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he asks.

""Huh?"" I respond, confused.

""Why did you short the domestic market?"" he demands, louder this time.

""I, uh... the coronavirus is a global pandemic. It's going to cause-"" WHAM! One of the thugs behind me slams my head with something heavy. It's a bundle of $100 bills. They're still warm from the printing press, and the fresh smell of ink fills my nose. It must be a million or more.

""It's priced in,"" he says coolly. ""So why did you short the domestic market?""

Dizzy from the blow, I notice the screen behind the Chairman. The S&P has climbed back to 2850. Impossible, I think to myself. ""Be-be-because unemployment is approaching 20 percent!"" I manage to answer. WHAM! Another blow strikes me. This time, a heavy bag filled with paper. It explodes on impact, raining bond certificates like confetti all over the small room. I catch a glimpse of some as they float to the ground. Investment grade bonds from Ford. Loans to cruise ship companies. Loans to a taco truck.

""Repeat after me: stocks only go up,"" Powell demands.

I say nothing. On the terminal behind him, the S&P has climbed well over 3000. An involuntary guh escapes my mouth as it falls agape.

Powell frowns and continues, ""I'll ask you one more time: why did you short the domestic market?""

I feel like I'm going to pass out again, but with all the strength I can muster I shout, ""GDP declines are going to dwarf the Great Depression! The outbreak is far from over! Stimulating demand won't work if there's no supply! Social unrest is a real possibility! We're in uncharted ter-"" the hardest slam yet hits the back of my skull. It's a massive stack of printer paper. It falls to the floor with a thud. Some sort of Excel spreadsheet is on it. It's the Fed's balance sheet. It must be tens of thousands of pages long. I can't even count how many digits are in their asset balance.

""Stocks only go up,"" Powell repeats. Behind him, the chart shows the S&P has continued its rise at a blistering pace. It leaves 3300 in the dust, making new all time highs.

The first two blows to my head left me feeling woozy. The third one, though, brought sudden clarity. Tears well up in my eyes, but they are not tears of sadness as my puts become worthless - oh no. They are tears of joy. Suddenly, I see it. Suddenly, the truth rings out as clearly as if a chorus of angels has descended from Heaven to sing it into my ears. How could I have been so wrong all these years? In this moment, I am enlightened. The pieces fall into place.

""Stocks only go up,"" I say."
2021-05-27 04:42:29,wallstreetbets,"Just sold my 800 shares of AMC, I’m out folks! I got burned bag holding MVIS a few weeks ago and vowed to always “sell early” after that.

*It's hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks, but ""The Greatest Love of All"" is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation, dignity. Its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in this world we live in to empathize with others, we can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message, crucial really.

They have a lot more cash than they do debt. I have a hard time paying insane stock prices in companies like AMC that would be $2 a share if it wasn't for reddit. MVIS looks good though.

Edit: b4 position or ban. GME buys at $21, $40, $145. Held through initial squeeze because it could have gone higher (RH fucked it etc, but I should have took profits) but also because fomo, I admit. Sold 1/6 at $290 for fun money, sold another 1/6 at $185 and $240 to flip into NVDA and Tesla calls. Still hold 4/6 of my original position."

2021-05-26 21:19:12,wallstreetbets,They know the attempted play. They’ve known for months. They shorted high last time. Probably bought the dip and road back up. Covered their shorts for a profit before it got too high. After the next short report that shows low short interest they’ll short the hell out of it at the top again and dump their shares triggering a retail sell off because the squeeze is over... at least until the next short report and everyone thinks they haven’t learned. They’ve had ample warning and aren’t gonna get caught with their pants down on the same stocks again. I’m sure they’ll be profiting off the retail group think the whole way. May as well just send your money straight to them.

it lasts a few days then comes back down again so it is doubtful they will continue to climb through next week.

Android was a side project and now it is 75% of the phone market. The only other companies who do this on a similar scale are Amazon and Tesla. Tesla is too volatile, Go with Google or Amazon. 

Apple has stopped coming out with novel products and are effectively surviving off re-sizing prior products. It was a cult of personality and their cult leader died. They have a big war chest, but are stagnant."

2021-05-26 21:40:12,wallstreetbets,"it's pure dogshit. GME has a legit future, so I'm not shitting on every meme stonk here (I've made a killing on GME in the second run-up and may yet still on this one) But you asked about amc. How AMC is listed on a stock exchange is beyond me. Its book value per share is negative 5. negative. That's impossible for a listed company, yet there it is, traded publicly. It's debt is twice its market cap. TWICE. So even if it did a stock buyback it wouldn't' be able to dent that debt, which is charging high interest. And maybe that's not terrible \[narrator: that's horrible\] but to crawl out of debt it needs revenue, and it's annual revenue is negative 1.2 billion, so it rolls itno more debt, and interest rates go up. It had zero way out of bankruptcy BEFORE the pandemic. You hear that? BEFORE the pandemic it could not be saved. So even if it were to sell out every seat for the next 3 years it would still be completely bankrupt. It's not just dogshit, it's warm dogshit smeared inside an old tire in the middle of a raging tire fire. But you could have easily looked all of this up in 3 seconds on yahoo finance or any brokerage account, so you're retarded and deserve to buy it. Enjoy! hope you get in at the peak like every other fucking idiot on here."

2021-05-26 23:15:31,wallstreetbets,"Thanks dude, yeah I agree :) 

I was down 70% at one point, so when i was up roughly 20% decided to cash out. Not gonna FOMO this time, that’s why I’m asking about whether BB is a buy since it’s still below half its ATH this year and it seems to have good fundamentals"
2021-05-26 23:10:39,wallstreetbets,I bought in right before the RH fiasco. Held even when my memefolio was down -70%. Didn’t think those two were gonna moon after stagnating for several months.

2021-05-27 06:14:43,wallstreetbets,PMed you a subreddit
2021-05-26 20:42:51,wallstreetbets,Sounds about right. Looks like the other peaks on RBLX 1 yr graph took about 8 days to bottom out. Thats whatsup. When i rolled over my other puts i went for 98 strike price just to be safe. But those are like 1k each. So this time i might pick up a couple at 90 strike.
2021-05-27 03:36:13,wallstreetbets,It's written in stone if you can buy a share it's still the dip GME AMC
2021-05-27 04:05:32,wallstreetbets,By necessity there will be just as many holding hopeless bags. Don't let the diamond hand memes make it you!

2021-05-26 23:54:14,wallstreetbets,20 years ago I had a statistics professor that demonstrated that charting is bullshit
2021-05-26 20:44:36,wallstreetbets,"Throw logic out the window.

AMC was a corporate money grab where the execs literally took investors money and lined their own pockets.

Now it’s mooning so people can go buy $30 worth of candy and complain about people ruining the movie."
2021-05-26 23:43:28,wallstreetbets,"Everyone that has been stuck inside for a year and told by their government that they know better and you can't leave the house unless we tell you that you can.

Theaters are a milestone in adolescence.  You don't grow up watching streaming services in your family room, you get a handy or blowsky in the back row from your crush.

The movie theater is here to stay. And I will gladly pay the ticket for the experience."
2021-05-26 22:11:48,wallstreetbets,LOL you know the source bro rsotc.com
2021-05-27 13:58:28,wallstreetbets,"Nothing about the stock price is logical.  The irrational drive up in price allowed them to sell more shares and extend their lifeline but it doesn't change their fundamental shortcomings.  The chain was in trouble before the pandemic, the stock charts and financials show this.  They don't own their theater locations but opted for super long leases that force them to keep non profitable locations open.

Not saying you can't make money here but have an exit strategy and stick to it.  Market isn't always about the fundamentals, sometimes ya just gotta play the momentum."
2021-05-26 23:08:08,wallstreetbets,"This is the one thing these retards fail at.  They talk only of holding.  Doesn’t seem to enter many of their minds that they could be selling to increase their warchest, and buying back in on the pullbacks, this would make their moon hopes more likely.  Nope, gonna go all in and just hold."
2021-05-27 15:10:30,wallstreetbets,"The gay part about AMC specifically is it is truly a shit company that deserves to be shorted to death to make room for the future of movie theatres.

Not just see your childhood memories through rose tinted glasses and pretend AMC used to be a good movie going experience."
2021-05-27 17:55:00,wallstreetbets,So buy puts tomorrow? lol :)
2021-05-27 15:14:54,wallstreetbets,"Was always a shit movie theater.  The twats could not figure out to not have giant light fixtures flanking the screen making the sides discolored yellow.  Haven't stepped foot in an AMC theater for over 10 years.  Have much better theaters to go to.  That cost less, have real food ( that costs less than a medium popcorn at AMC ) and beer on tap.  

I'll stick with renting out an entire theater with my friends and getting a burger and a beer for less than the cost of an AMC ticket with a theater full of assholes on their phones.

I’m not bitter about it, just wish they didn’t use their power to bail out a shitty company. I know people will say they just did it for the money, but fuck AMC"

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Sarepta SRPT Some odd price movement on this stock lately with other biotechs doing very well. They had a bad report which sent the stock down 50% earlier this year, but recently followed it up with some good data and reports from people in their trials are that their gene therapy produces results.  They will never cure anything, but for kids with muscular distrophy just keeping them from getting worse is as good as a cure.  Cathy Wood took a position and exited it fairly quickly, before the most recent good data.  If they can retrace even half of the move down from earlier this year it would be a big gain.  I think the CEO is universally disliked and should have looked to be an acquisition target a long time ago by one of the big players, but instead was making deals and trying to just do collaborations.  It seems like traders hate this stock and short sellers move the price on a daily basis. Anyone have an opinion on it?"
2021-05-26 20:27:45,wallstreetbets,"75@21.39. 

It has peaked and valley'd several times over the years. Next 18 months will be very interesting as several pipeline updates coming. Sales ramping up. Maybe a 4th exon skipping drug submitted. 

Looking forward to staying on this rollercoaster."
2021-05-26 20:17:23,wallstreetbets,That’s a good question. The reason for the big drop has been debunked by the later study 103. So now all the pieces are back in line with the stock price at $181. It will recover and rise back over time. Patience pays.
2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.

EDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 

"" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can’t fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It’s a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. ""

Price action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.

With ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.

[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \(high short float\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)

DO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.

THE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.

Execute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions

TLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar

Positions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls. DO AS YOU WISH SHARES WILL WIN NO MATTER WHAT BUT PROVIDE LESS TENDIES"

2021-05-27 12:30:41,wallstreetbets,"Nice strategy and I am considering it now as well! So thanks for that!

Taking a look at the chain currently, spreads on any strikes except ATM are huge. Just something to consider, since the slippage might literally be larger than the collected dividends."

2021-05-26 20:09:06,wallstreetbets,For real lmao imma call up my schwab
2021-05-26 20:14:04,wallstreetbets,No execute them before 6/9 if you have the cash (500 a contract) then you will have the shares that will pay you dividends. That’s why leaps are so cheap - no dividend
2021-05-26 20:38:09,wallstreetbets,I think it’s smart to diversify your moon stocks.
2021-05-27 08:26:03,wallstreetbets,12-15 is probably realistic.
2021-05-27 01:07:07,wallstreetbets,We all buy one - but for real the play is to squeeze it before then preferably around 6/9 for dividend and memes. I will likely hold some share through the july dump you are talking about simply because I like the company and that doesnt really change the company (other than what a normal offering would do). Also who knows if gores will actually offload in July especially if the price is below $10.
2021-05-27 02:17:19,wallstreetbets,"44,400 shares here and 100 6/18 $8 and 100 $9 strike calls and am considering adding more of that 9 real early tomorrow. Long hail us believers! Minus your 70 puts of course"

2021-05-27 08:58:08,wallstreetbets,I thought for $35 why not try it and see what happens. Not a ton of time but as we all know lots happening potentially in the next few weeks. But thanks for letting me know I can also sell it if it gets close and not getting to break even. This is the only stock I feel comfortable even trying this with since it’s the one I know the most about which still isn’t a ton but way more then others
2021-05-26 20:15:41,wallstreetbets,15-20 doesn’t sound unreasonable in a bullish case. I understand a lot of people here have done their dd and really believe in this play. I hope it works out for you all.

Just have to time the cycle right. But now may hit the $10-12 range again... All the other Russels trade in $20+ range made a good bit of woof at same time.... Safe to buy shares now for xdiv... May have to roll my June calls out but that's it as took profit the other week.
2021-05-26 22:48:09,wallstreetbets,Nice. I recently started playing with options myself. I'm making pretty good use of selling covered calls as well to make a little bit of extra money.

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"KMI Kinder Morgan DD It's getting ready to run again   

Kinder Morgan has the largest natural gas transmission network with \~70 thousand miles of natural gas pipelines, 659 bcf of storage capacity, and \~1200 miles of NGL. The company is the largest independent transporter of refiner products \~6800 miles of refined product pipelines and \~3100 miles of crude pipelines.

Kinder Morgan is also the largest independent terminal operator with 144 terminals & 16 Jones Act vessels. These together enabled the company to increase natural gas income during the Texas storm, something that wasn't a one-off. The company is the largest CO2 transporter with \~1.5 bcf/day of capacity, showing its strength.

* Kinder Morgan benefited off of the Texas Storm with its DCF expected to reach almost $6 billion for the year.
* The company has a dividend of almost 6% and it's continuing to invest in its business for the long run.
* The company has an impressive and diverse portfolio of assets which we expect it'll be able to utilize to drive substantial long-term shareholder rewards.

From Seeking Alpha's latest. 

I am a Long Term Shareholder. Where do you see KMI in a Year?"

I just realized I thought that KMI is an energy infrastructure company. I thought they were producing wood. Lol, I think I reached my peak.

The universe isn't expanding at all. The universe is a black hole inside another universe.  Were all matter that had been sucked into the black hole going towards the singularity. The birth of our universe was just a great resizing of the singularity (the infinitely small and infinitely dense point at the center of a black hole) of the prior universe. Our universe (the singularity) just appears to be expanding because all matter within the singularity is being resized smaller and smaller into perpetuity, so to us, the scale of our universe is infinitely large, but to the prior universe, our universe is infinitely small. 

That's the theory that keeps me up at night."

1) This sub has made history, idgaf what anyone says. Hedge funds are hemorrhaging money and for the first time in my life they’re reaping what they sew.

Theoretically couldn’t hedges have puts waiting for the fall. isn’t the increase in price lately ONLY from apes/hypes. Wanda group sold a 19% stake in AMC a few days before the big recent gains.

2021-05-26 21:29:19,wallstreetbets,"6.5 billions if they are short as much as they claim to be. We know Melvin capital alone lost more than 6 billions. At the hight of the first squeeze, they were down 16-18 billions. 

Since GME float is short by more than 140% and according to DTCC there were no margin calls, this only means they shorted more. I think the actual short is at least 300% of the float. And the amounts lost by short sellers is already more than 30 billions

This is a never ending squeeze. Next year today we will still be going higher."

2021-05-27 00:38:07,wallstreetbets,"Is this S3 data totally bogus?

From the article:
Around 958,000 shares of GameStop, worth $201 million, were bought to cover short sales over the last week, S3 data showed. Roughly 11.55 million shares of GameStop, or 20.3% of its float, are currently sold short, Dusaniwsky said.

If they covered roughly 10% and it only cost 200 million — why would they be paying all this interest when they could have been out for way less than 6.5 billion by now. 

Maybe my math is broken currently but the S3 data seems wrong big time"

Once we have all the real basics covered we'll move into more complex mathematics like 1+1=2.

Ummm, says who? Is that what cause the short sellers to try to destroy this good company, that there were “reasons” to short it? This is how hedge funds have operated? 

Bullshit.

We long ago left plent earth, where stock performance was somehow related to the underlying company it represents. The entire market has been growing despite a worldwide fucking pandemic. None of this is connected to reality anymore. It is all a buyer confidence game now.

2021-05-27 16:58:05,wallstreetbets,Ok but we have probably lost 10bil in total by not short selling GameStop
2021-05-27 18:26:24,wallstreetbets,And i lost 10000k on gme . I bought it 342 😭😭😭

They can & likely will take measures to cut us out. They have leverage both $ & political that we don't have. You're playing with fire. And we're all gonna get burned bcuz of these baby games. If you people want to keep making money long term, stop with this bullshite before you ruin it for everyone.

Where do most small day traders have their money? Tech, s & p, small cap stuff, high spec stuff.... how hard is it for the big boys to collaborate & drop entire sectors for months?

We're small mice running between the toes of dinosaurs picking off bits of meat here & there. Start pissing them off regularly and they'll take a moment to stomp us out.

2021-05-27 14:21:03,wallstreetbets,"6.5 billion sounds suspiciously LOW.  I didn't help that--I made 6249 in four shorts--my first ever since my late brother took me with him to his brokers to absorb the lesson that you could lose 8500 in shorting Gulf & Western--that was in 1968 when that was a lot of money.  Now you know why I didn't short until this year--GME was just at ridiculous prices for now and demanded I sell short screeching its lungs out.

   BTW I do hate hedge funds because they are in fact Stock Market Pools and thus have been illegal since 1934.  Don't Tax Then--BUST 'EM!  Right now I lose only if I have to cover above 234 and I figure GME will go below that--its floor remember is 157: 550 million divided by 3.5 million shares.  It's a debt-free company with 300 million to spend making good with new managers that know how do that--it will just take them three years to get GME to sell at 160 on fundamentals which drive the technicals anyways.  AMC won't have a theater on the moon before 2061 for the vacation market.  AMC will have Mars theaters before 2100 if settlements get large enough; GME will serve both markets better than AMC for entertainment anyways."

2021-05-26 20:10:52,wallstreetbets,They didn't.  [Citadel's long positions alone are worth over $400bn.](https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-21-007021/)  They have positions in over eleven thousand symbols.  They don't bat an eye at swings like this.

2021-05-26 20:41:53,wallstreetbets,Yes but the narrative that the big guys lost is a bit skewed. The majority of the big guys won apart from a few hedge funds. And a lot of small guys bought the top so there is as usual winners and losers on both sides.
2021-05-26 23:35:09,wallstreetbets,"Probably not.  It's only looking at one particular leg of a trading strategy.  If you look at the whole trading strategy, they're actually probably up.  For the past couple months GME bears have been selling weekly calls to mouthbreathers and raking in money."

2021-05-26 21:01:04,wallstreetbets,"I hear comments all the time about how they've shorted 120% or 160% of the stock.

Knowing what we know about hedge funds: if they had the ability to fraudulently create 1% or 20% or 60%. Why would they stop there? We know their greed knows no bounds. So why would they create 20 million 'synthetic'  shares, when they could create 200 million.

We have rumors, indicators, and glitches, that suggest the actual amount is in the 1k%'s.

If you go to the trouble to break into a bank vault, do you settle by only stealing a couple 20's? The answer is no, you clean them out. And that's exactly what hedge funds have done here. The real number of fraudulent shares is likely higher than anyone can imagine."

Their arrogance wouldn’t let them even consider that the Apes might not only hold the line - let alone even consider that they might actually double down because the Apes liked the stock & knew that if they owned the float all they had to do was wait while the HFs & BSDs bleed themselves dry.

I think at this point - Apes probably own quite a bit more than the float which means that a lot of the shorts are going to get rogered & good trying to close out their positions.

Of course, they have to either admit that they lost or go bankrupt for that to happen & as it happens, I grew up in a seriously old money family (*don’t kidnap me, I intentionally got disinherited & now they wouldn’t buy me a cup of coffee, let alone pay a ransom*) so I know exactly how these pigfuckers think & I walked away from all of it because it was toxic as shit.

So my bet is that we’ll have to wait for anyone who chose to short GME to run out of options or go broke because admitting that the great unwashed bested them at their own game can’t happen."

2021-05-26 22:11:41,wallstreetbets,"Well I’m reality I don’t think it’s any sort of fraudulent behavior. I do think it’s wrong and manipulation of shares and the market. It’s more like if there’s ONLY 1000 shares of a company in total, for explanation purpose. Hedge fund 1 “borrows” those 1000 shares and sells them, driving the price down. Now people can still buy and sell these 1000 shares freely. Now hedge fund 2 wants to short the company and borrows and sells 200 shares. These hedge funds both have open short positions that they will eventually have to cover. However, since there’s only 1000 shares of this company and since hedge fund 2 wanted to short the company, they had to reuse some of the already shorted shares."

As he explained how ""easy"" everything was I kept pushing him to mention whenever he had to put money down. In total he had about 15k in contractor down costs and about 20k in the house itself. He thought I was gunna comment on the risk and he kept saying he was basically living paycheck to paycheck on this and people just need to ""put the work in and live within their means"".

2021-05-26 22:19:43,wallstreetbets,"Ok.  Lets say I own a share of gamestop.  I'm positive that the company is going to do well in the future, so I have no desire to sell the stock anytime soon... or ever.  However, in the near future, the situation is looking grim, and there's a guy out there, named Bob, who thinks that Gamestop is going to lose some of it's value, and the stock is going to drop, at least in the short term.  However, he doesn't own any Gamestop stock, and if he bought some and it lost value, he'd lose money, and he's not in it for the same long game I am.

So Bob and I hatch this BRILLIANT scheme.  I will lend Bob my share of Gamestop, he will sell it now, and then wait a little while, buy it back at a lower price, give me my share of Gamestop back, and then give me a bit of extra money for my trouble.  That's the plan anyway.

However, after Bob sells my share of Gamestop, there's this other guy out there named Joe who's seriously thinking of a long term investment in Gamestop.  So he buys the share that Bob sold.  Now, Bob is patiently waiting for the stock to drop in price so he can buy it up, but while he's waiting, he figures... since his idea is so great, why not sell some MORE stock while he's waiting.  Of course, he's fresh out of Gamestop stock, but Joe over there has a share, and he's not doing anything useful with it right now, so lets go borrow it from him, and sell that share.  Now, the same share has been sold twice and is technically still owned by both Joe and myself.... on paper anyway."

2021-05-26 23:27:35,wallstreetbets,"So what you described is the ""normal"" market doing normal things.

What is speculated, hinted at, and an open secret; is that the hedge funds never borrowed the shares they sold. They sold shares they claimed they could borrow off the market. They sold many shares, and retail bought a whole lot of them. It's very likely retail investors own more shares than actually exist.

That's why people are referring to it as fraudulent shares. If the hedge funds actually found a lender to borrow each unique share, and then shorted them, then they wouldn't be in the problem they are today."

I think they're saying that's how they *justify* them being rich or that they are better suited for the money because of [insert self-accolade here]. Being hard working and smart/creative  should earn someone more money. However, these people often have so much money that they don't have to be smart and predict the market, they are the [stock] market to a degree.  They have so much money and clout that them acting changes the market simply by doing doing the action itself.

This is why so many people were pissed when these hedge funds shorted the housing market back in 2008. It accelerated a crash that they and their banking buddies created by giving out loans to people frivilously. So they knew the crash was coming and they accelerated it for their own gain. It's not smart or hard working, obviously, but those are the accolades that these people give to themselves to justify what they're doing."

2021-05-27 00:12:19,wallstreetbets,"Eh mine wasn’t all that dramatic at first - as I’m sure you’ve seen, the elder generation uses the purse strings to puppet the younger & I wasn’t having any of that.

So September of my senior year of high school, I turned 18 & the next day my parents handed me a check for three months of the median rent, shook my hand & wished me all the best.

At which point, I was merely cut off, not disinherited - this was their (*the family elders, not my parents, although they went along with it*) smug attempt at teaching me a lesson so that I’d be cowed & return to the fold.

Fortunate I only had a single semester left to graduate so I got a job as a graveyard line cook at a nearby Denny’s & while it wasn’t easy, it confirmed what I already knew - that I didn’t miss all the shiny toys & frills of that life - although it did surprise me how much I loved not getting pulled into their drama.

& so until I was about 25, there as an uneasy detente. I was reimbursed for any expenses (*as long as I had the receipts*) I incurred that related to the family but I wouldn’t have access to the resources. 

I did continue to sit on the board of most of the family foundations but other than that, I was pretty much free of the constraints which bound say my cousins (*then again they received a stipend of ~$50k a quarter - so they thought I was being ridiculously obstinate*).

It all hit the fan when I was 25 as my great uncle’s (*he was the patriarch of the family*) health decline & as I had been raised to replace him, the elder generation decided enough was enough & I needed to stop fucking about, come back into the fold & handle my responsibilities to the family.

They did have a point to be honest, I had been unreasonable, obstinate & unyielding - not to mention that my complaints about not wanting to be manipulated & controlled would be moot as I would the one with my hands on the purse strings.

However, in those years as a detached observer, I was able to see the massive gulf between the ideals the family espoused & the way they treated each other - I recognized that they treated strangers far better than each other & especially since I would now be expected to be the one herding cats & keeping folks in check; I realized that I wanted no part of any of it.

I wasn’t wealthy by any means but I made more money than my minimal wants required so I refused & told them that I wasn’t interested, & would never be.

That’s when the shit really hit the fan before I was just being an amusingly headstrong & independent young man but now, not only was I abandoning my familial objections, I was repudiating all of the symbols which to them represented status & value.

These days, I rarely go to extended family events (*except funerals*) & I don’t bother with reimbursements. We interact to the degree necessary at such occasions with distant civility & make the appropriate gestures & then go back to our separate lives.

There is no question my life would have been a lot easier & more comfortable had I gone back into the fold but I have no regrets.

I’ve spent the last 27 years on my own terms, had my own successes & failures, made my own mistakes & usually learned from them (*some mistakes are too much fun to make only once*).

I’ve definitely walked a road far different than the one which was intended for me & it has (*for both good & ill*) made all the difference.

These days, I plan to find a quiet corner of my own, spend some time with my books & enjoy the next five years in restive reflection."

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Energy Fuels about to explode TLDR: The entire ecosystem surrounding Energy Fuels is primed to make it a cornerstone US REE/Uranium company. Currently sitting under a 1B market cap - it is a ticking time 'bomb'.

The below will give short thesis in each market factor surrounding Energy Fuels.

**Uranium Squeeze** \- Unless you've been sitting under a rock over the past year you know that uranium mining around the world has all but dried up due to the low spot price (its not economically viable at the current price to mine uranium). Meaning that the **world wide consumption of uranium is far outpacing the production**. Currently, the low price is sustained by reserves but once these dry up the spot price is likely to rocket up. Energy Fuels is not only sitting on reserves but can start mining within 6 months. The spot price has gone from $28 -> $31 this past month and its anyone's guess when reserves will dry up but it seems to be an inevitability. This reddit post goes more in depth for the 2021 outlook on uranium supply - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/kpjvhs/2021_will_be_an_unforgettable_year_for_uranium/)

**REE** \- Likely the largest and most important development for this company is that Energy Fuels has a road map for a complete USA in-house REE production chain. If you don't know, the REE market is exploding right now due to many new demands in the market/short supply (pls research, not going to cover here). As a case study see MP - which has a **5B market cap compared to < 1B Energy Fuels**. Now MP has to ship their material oversees for processing in China which to the US is slowly being recognized as a serious national security issue. But in walks Energy Fuels which is proposing an end to end supply chain of REE material at its facility in White Mesa, Utah baby. Lets recap, Energy Fuels **is offering not only green energy solutions with uranium but a solution to a national security risk in the REE market.** good shit.

**Monazite vs Bastnaesite and radioactive material** \- Now that you had an intro to MP, lets get to an important detail that will allow Energy Fuels to take on the REE market quickly and effectively with an inherent advantage. MP produces REE material through the mining of Bastnaesite. However, Monazite ore (which is mined by Energy Fuels for uranium) is richer in rare earths. Ok but why then would MP not simply mine Monzanite???? Its because its radioactive and in the US, there are ungodly amounts of red tape/restrictions around the stuff which basically **makes it impossible to get a new permit to handle it.** But guess who already has one due to its uranium mining - god damn Energy Fuels which means they have already have their source material in line and ready to go with an advantage in REE richness - they just have to figure out processing which brings me to the next point. Not to mention the same material can be leverage for more uranium!

See the chart below to compare the two ores (the REE market us said to only really depend on 4 critical elements - Nd neodymium, Eu europium, Tb terbium, Dy dysprosium) [source](https://www.mining.com/the-only-five-rare-earth-elements-that-matter/)

https://preview.redd.it/s6s8qwy39i171.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d910feb79393f4fe0de5fad54e89f5bead4c39

**Financials** \- Feel free to check this dd yourself but Energy Fuels is **debt free** with **$40 million in liquid cash** that they have already said is going towards developing the REE pipeline. They have the source material, they are already mining it, and now they are building the US based processing for it :)

**History** **(\*this is more speculative)** \- Energy Fuels (as the uranium market is cyclical) has gone through huge up and down swings as seen below in 2007 and 2011. We are seeing the start of the run up. Hard to say if REE will provide stability to the chart but no reason to not jump on this coming spike

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$RIOT and $MARA DD from The Oracle that is Great Daddy Elon Hello fellow WSB degens,

I will be outlining for you today why RIOT and MARA even after today's run up will continue on a meteoric rise.

Firstly the price is currently in the mid 20's for each stonk. This makes sense because back in Jan 2021 the prices of both stonks were in the mid 20's because a certain underlying asset these stonks are based on was trading at 40k and is currently trading once again at 40k. I will refer to this asset during this post as CUA for the rest of this post (certain underlying asset) disclaimer for mods this whole post does not really involve CUA going up or down it is based off of several factors that lead me to believe these specific stonks are undervalued at their current prices even if CUA goes down further. I am forced to mention CUA to explain this reasoning.

Now the fact these stonks are both in the mid $20's like they were back in Jan 2021 no longer makes sense when you factor in that RIOT has tripled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment and MARA has doubled their mining hash rate via the purchase of more mining equipment. This is akin to a gold mine discovering there just so happened to be double or triple the amount of gold they previously thought was in their mine, or Amazon AWS buying 2-3 times more servers to rent out if AWS could somehow guarantee clients for all those servers 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year. More mining equipment = more revenue. You can tell this is starting to get realized because even though CUA is down today (26-5-21) both of these stonks are up double digits.

As if the above was not reason enough to think these stonks could reasonably 2x or 3x even without an increase in the price of CUA please continue reading.

Now on to China banning CUA mining in China. China controls 65% of the total hash rate of CUA. If China were to stop mining CUA this would bring down the total hash rate of CUA significantly. This would be very good for any and all remaining CUA miners as the CUA difficulty would also drop by 65%. 

To help you autists understand I will compare this to pizza. (Sorry I couldnt think of how to make this analogy with tendies)

If you have 1 pizza and 10 people and you wish to split the pizza equally you would slice the pizza into 10 slices and give everyone 1 slice. This is how CUA mining works. Now imagine that China currently takes 6.5 pieces of pizza but Chinese government is going to tell Chinese citizens they can no longer legally eat pizza in China. Now the rest of the world gets to split those 6.5 pieces of pizza amongst themselves equally. 

Personally I am too retarded to actually do the math to see how this would change MARA and RIOT revenue but it might be as simple as increasing all of their profit by 65%? Not sure. Maybe you divide 65 by 35 and then add that number (1.8) to all the other miners.

The above was all concrete reasoning on why these stonks are both undervalued, but theres a literally shitton of undervalued stonks and there are plenty of retarded overpriced stonks too who is to say that any of the above reasoning matters and the people will care? Theres a lot of stonks bottom line. What is my catalyst for believing these stonks will continue to see momentum and provide tendies?

The below is my retarded opinion and autist forecast into what will occur and provide said tendies to anyone who wishes to participate in the upside of these stocks.

The large majority if not all of this past correction in CUA price can be chalked up to China and Elon. Elon recently tweeted that he no longer liked CUA due to the process of mining being ""dirty"" this is because China controls 65% of the entire hash rate of CUA and China uses the most coal for energy of any country in the world. Elon has now tweeted that he will be meeting with miners in North America to discuss this fact and allow the miners to refute. What Elon will discover is that it is highly unprofitable to mine CUA on electricity deriving from non renewable energy sources as renewable energy sources are the cheapest. The vast majority of large mining operations in North America utilize hydropower RIOT and MARA both use hydropower too. The next thing that Elon will discover is that while China uses more coal for energy than any other country they also use more hydro for energy than any other country. China leads the world in hydroelectricity by any and all metrics including number of dams, sizes of dams, total output of individual dams, total output of all dams, etc. Mining on coal energy is stupid because it is the most expensive energy to produce of any energy. Seeing as how CUA miners only have to pay for internet and electricity bills and internet doesnt really matter cheap electricity makes or breaks their business. Literally RIOT and MARA have 8 employees and 3 employees according to Robinhood. The only bill/cost they care about is electric cost and they want that to be as cheap as possible which will always be renewable energy sources.

Personally I am of the belief that this is all part of Great Daddy Elon's master plan. He pretended to side with the environmentally friendly activists who advocate against CUA mining. This brought global attention to the issue and now he will unveil that he was wrong and this is not the case because mining is all green renewable energy. Great Daddy Elon is never wrong remember that. Elon has even stated things to the contrary of his recent tweet against CUA before when he talked about oil and coal energy subsidies in the US. Just remember that the gooberment says they want more green energy yet they heavily subsidize oil, gas, and coal energy. Until 2023 if you start an oil, gas, or coal energy project the government will subsidize for you to do so to the tune of financing 80-100 percent of the project. Yes that is right. That green stuff is a lie because the peak subsidy for solar projects was 33% and its now like 26%. Great Daddy Elon knows this because Great Daddy Elon knows all as he is the one who told us this.

2021-05-26 21:41:45,wallstreetbets,"I think that both stocks are promising.  IMO China doesn't need to ban mining on CUA for the stocks to go up.  As long as CUA rises (which it should due to inflation), then the stocks should rise.  A big concern I have is that the CUA block halving will outpace CUA's rise (which it probably will), then MARA and RIOT won't be able to keep up.  The Elon bit is interesting.  He's already fked CUA, so he can only raise it by backtracking.  Like what else could he do to tank it... What do I know though I'm bagholding hard lol.  Hope these fuckers boom."

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NNMD Nano Dimension Short Interest I invested a couple hundred shares into NNDM over that last couple months.  I’m relatively new to investing but like the potential growth of technology in the 3d printing realm. 

After some gains today, I was researching the news that prompted the price increasing.  While doing so, I noticed the short interest was over 100%.  I don’t remember that being the case in the past. What’s the best resource to educate myself on short interest info on this stock historically over time?"
2021-05-27 02:01:34,wallstreetbets,Just from the price action and seeing the pinning around call max pain I’m heavily inclined toward the short interest being much more in line with TDs 101%. Someone is clearly manipulating the stock. The 1.5 billion in cash on hand would mean $6 per share in cash for each share. So considering the ridiculous valuations of stocks lately NNDM should be at $12 at least. Someone is shorting heavy and manipulating down.

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How to profit from the final stages of Coronavirus This is not financial advice. Please do your own DD.

&#x200B;

Coronavirus is almost history folks. As the world is slowly opening, and restrictions being lifted (thank you to those who are vaccinated), There's still one last industry that is preparing for take off.

This summer airlines will make a comeback. Sooner rather than later travel will be back on the menu.

The CDC is lifting all restrictions for domestic travel for vaccinated people. It's only a matter of time before more restrictions are lifted.

"" If you [travel in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html), you do not need to get tested before or after travel or self-quarantine after travel.""

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html)

&#x200B;

Europe is considering opening it's borders to vaccinated people possibly this summer although no date is set.

[https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2021/05/19/europe-travel-restrictions-american-visitors-vaccinated-eu-travel-ban/5021160001/)

&#x200B;

Now that the hype of the vaccine has died down and people are seriously getting vaccinated airlines are set to have a comeback.

&#x200B;

Any airline will do fine but I believe that Canadian airlines will have the greatest comeback due to the very low amount of vaccinated citizens right now. As their vaccine rate goes up so will the stock prices of industries that will open up again.

The Canadian population is \~4% fully vaccinated while \~45% of them have had one dose.

[https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/#a7)

&#x200B;

Compared to \~40% fully vaccinated and \~50% with at least one dose in the US

[https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)

&#x200B;

In a previous post I showed that Air Canada was the best Canadian airline to invest with. They are slowly step laddering up in price. In mid April they received a 5.9 billion dollar bailout from the government which secured their comeback. They are just waiting for restrictions to be lifted and I'm sure they've thought of ways to profit in a post-pandemic world.

&#x200B;

Whether you invest in airlines by paying for a fun experience, or by buying their stock, either way many people are going to give their money to airlines this summer. The question is which side will you be on?

Goodluck ladies and gents

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Airlines will make a comeback as restrictions lift. Canada still has a low vax population so the good news for them will cause greater surges in airline stock prices. I know many people who want to travel but few who want to buy stock.**"
2021-05-26 21:47:37,wallstreetbets,I played airlines back in September and got out fully in early December. Too much risk vs reward IMO at these prices while they're still hemorrhaging money.

With all the dilution and debt from the pandemic, it wouldn't be too surprising to see a few buyouts, merges, and bankruptcies popping up from the traveling industries. It would just be difficult to pinpoint the specific airline that emerges on top.   
  
But off your DD, wouldn't BA or airbus be a solid play? Airlines can fail but whatever airlines remain still needa buy airplanes. Also, during the pandemic, time just started eating away at the currently active planes meaning more demand for planes in general. Iunno that's my two cents.

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Daym it feels good to be a GME hodler in times like these! Take a look at this sweet TA picture: Bollinger Bands are boilin', MACD(onalds) pointing north... And the Purple Haze is being tested! How do you like this, Wen Moon?  

[GME Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/7f0br59p2i171.jpg?width=2379&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8235e35a004aee7fa7f74e591251a636aa2421ce)

Sup, WSB folks!

It’s Roman here with my Technical ANALysis, remember me? I’m the guy who [put the beard on the line, stating that GME is heading at least to thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/), soon, and my beard is doing well so far, as you may see. Furthermore, recently I did [AMC TA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/), and it got to [CBS fucking news](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/amc-gamestop-meme-stock-rally-continues/)! Btw, the first major resistance there of $16 has been broken already, $20 is the next one and the things are going according to the forecast.

Congrats to AMC hodlers, but today we’ll take a look at the superior stonk‘s current TA state, discussing how things might play out in the shorter term perspective.

The first thing to take a look at this [GME](https://imgur.com/a/eAxaHhE) chart, is the beautiful Bollinger Bands setup. Bollinger Bands is a powerful TA instrument, used by traders for the purpose of identifying potential support and resistance zones, as well as a trend direction. Furthermore, BB is a helpful tool to work with the volatility, as price action‘s fluctuations are taken as a cornerstone measurement for the Bollinger channels. As you should be able to see on the chart, with the volatility in Jan, Feb and Mar the BB channel looks thick (just as your BF’s GF’s ass). Since the beginning of April, though, the consolidation is obvious, and the channel consequently has been narrowing down. But BOOM, the breakout happened yesterday followed by the conformational solidly looking gap today. The setup of a very similar nature crystallized in January too (highlighted blue) and it is easy to see what happened afterwards. Juicy, what else can I say.

MACD. The thing points up, indicating the bullish momentum, with all of the threes indicators (MACD, Signal and Histogram) being on the bullish territory and accelerating with the current price action.

And the most important factor to 🐻 in mind, resistances. As I mentioned in the title, the Purple Haze ($233) is being tested currently, and to my understanding, this is the most important price level for GME currently (refer to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) for the explanation). As soon as this one is conquered, $350 and $481 seem to be the next two major resistances on the horizon.

I hope, that you enjoyed this little piece of TA, have a great day! 

(and compulsory not a fin advise and fuck you!)"

2021-05-27 02:25:29,wallstreetbets,"It's really exciting. It's crazy to think I might actually make some cash off of this. Money has never been an issue in my life, but by no means am I rich. 

One day I just want to move out and have a driveway to wash and work on my car in. GME probably isn't gonna get me the $400k I need for a house, but it'll just go towards the down payment."
2021-05-26 20:24:43,wallstreetbets,"These are the resistance numbers I get...holy crap, what a ride this is about to be but it all will start with closing above 250.

2021-05-27 05:56:29,wallstreetbets,So by the looks on pre-market. Today we may be testing 233 resistance level.

2021-05-26 21:45:52,wallstreetbets,"Many analysis have since the successful test flight given SPCE upgrades.

2021-05-26 21:44:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah I remember reading this.  So do you believe the shorts are putting maximum pressure now as they know they can’t win with the upcoming Branson flight ?
2021-05-26 21:13:10,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for sharing...I've posted several times and had the same thing happen. All respect to GME's run, but I think we all know that this sub is full of Gamestop bag holders and they need endless memes and To-The-Moons to keep the stock from crashing back to the $20/share it is really worth.

SPCE would have already hit $30/share if it wasn't suppressed.....everytime there is a video about # of mentions by ticker, SPCE always starts off in 1st place and then drops off EVERY DAY THIS WEEK"

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Could it be possible that they are simulating a squeeze to get people to buy higher and then they will drop it like a potato again? The fact that information symmetry is now quite reduced and everyone knows that apes are waiting for a squeeze. Any slight indication that a squeeze may be happening will drive the retards to buy higher.

But think about it, what if this is a ploy?
What if they are the ones driving it up getting a lot of people who hold the shares to start buying calls and shares. And they will start another attack to bring it down again. When it’s down the profit is booked.

The highest open interest is at 300 and I’m sure people are buying these calls. The number doubled just as I was typing this post!"
2021-05-26 21:38:05,wallstreetbets,Montezuma's revenge is the understatement
2021-05-26 20:08:10,wallstreetbets,They have no money to drop it significantly. With margin debt and collateral requirements... It doesn't make sense . They would've already done it. That's why we see higher lows ever since the big march drop.
2021-05-26 21:04:47,wallstreetbets,"Maybe yes, maybe no. Doesn't cost a dime to hold."
2021-05-26 22:38:12,wallstreetbets,"Wait you mean..what if they are using the same ploy that hasn't worked any of the other times they've tried it? THEN WE WILL HOLD AND BUY THE FUCKING DIP YOU RETARD, ITS LITERALLY THE ONLY STRATEGY WE HAVE."

2021-05-26 20:02:18,wallstreetbets,"It's been stable at a relatively high price for quite a while.  So given all the apes % holdings, this is much easier to push up than down.
Some whale or pod of dolphins decided it's good to buy some calls, a ton of shares, fuck the shorties, and eat some tendies.
We control the bulk of shares, so everyone holding means even if it dips when this play ends, it still likely averages up."

2021-05-26 20:02:45,wallstreetbets,You can’t profit from short selling unless you get to short sell at a high rate.

2021-05-27 05:39:21,wallstreetbets,I buy more at $40 then
2021-05-26 21:20:12,wallstreetbets,This has happened before I’ll believe it when it passes 350$.  The price action on this stock is weird as hell.  Remember how it jumped from 40$ to 180$ in a few hours?  Remember when it was past 200$ then dropped down to 90$ in like 30 minutes then immediately back up again.  WSB is keeping the stock from tanking so the big boys can keep shaving off the top.  I made well on the first run not in it now because I just don’t trust the behind the scenes action.
2021-05-26 23:53:46,wallstreetbets,"It seems like it's more likely to be buy ins due to FTD cycles. Lots of great DD on this in other subs. Apes didn't sell at 450 or 350, why would they sell now. The market is cornered, the shares are **priceless**. 
Rocket rocket rocket bro"
2021-05-27 01:37:13,wallstreetbets,"Look, I hope you are right, I was holding like a true ape, to the moon an all that shit; but on one of those up and downs I sold half of my position and bought it back on the dip, I’ve been milking profits ever since, maybe I lost my ape status but this doesn’t look like is going to stop anytime soon, shorts are still going at it cause they think we’ll get tired, people gets attracted each time price goes up and the feedback takes it real high which makes lots of people sell, then the shorts start flexing their billions and pummel it down, which makes it very attractive again; I hope it goes forever."
2021-05-27 05:05:17,wallstreetbets,"There is no reason to hope this goes longer lol. I would say if this goes on for 8 months more, it will go on for eternity, cause that would mean the vote count failed.


rather pay 20% of 10000% gains than having 50% gains for 8 months"
2021-05-27 05:54:03,wallstreetbets,"This is one of the reasons why I love Canada. In a normal investment account, even holding something for a week counts as capital gains(no long term/short term, all counts as 50% reduced) Not to mention TFSA's."

2021-05-27 00:12:22,wallstreetbets,Ty! This is the DD i come here for!
2021-05-26 22:42:43,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-26 22:34:14,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, consolidate around the 20 (with Options)...turn WSB into bag holders--> buy 20 dollar PUTS for dirt---> short sell to the floor (they recruited...check the SEC filings (the ones they want you to see that is...ETF's Index Funds, fucking JP Morgan doesn't just decide to BUY in at the upper 85th price percentile)-> sell shares  at 20 using the PUTS when it's 6--> rinse and repeat when you have more money than God. In a nutshell...Look at the current lower time frames charts, see anything peculiar? Long story short, this isn't a squeeze and retail are being taken for fools...don't let it happen."

2021-05-27 16:29:02,wallstreetbets,That sounds like a very reasonable strategy.  Why are you here?
2021-05-27 08:05:37,wallstreetbets,They take 50% no matter what? Lol ours is 35% for 12 months then 15% and the longer you hold the lower it goes. Unless dementia dipshit fucks us and raises capital gains tax
2021-05-27 08:48:45,wallstreetbets,Even if you hold for 20 years?
2021-05-26 20:28:28,wallstreetbets,"> How can one estimate that HF are “close” to margin calls?

Unless you're an insider working at one of these firms, you can't. Everyone is guessing"
2021-05-26 20:21:45,wallstreetbets,Lot of people making guesses or posting what they “feel”. I agree with you. Only real thing is to buy and hold if you have any belief in a true squeeze/future of GameStop. These people guessing at margin calls need to relax

2021-05-26 22:16:08,wallstreetbets,Good luck...
2021-05-26 21:33:36,wallstreetbets,Ah ok makes sense thanks :)
2021-05-27 00:34:40,wallstreetbets,"At this point I have to wonder if they'll ever want to cover. Maybe they're planning to cover at 100$, but I'd imagine they'd be arrogant enough to think they could drive it lower if it ever got to 100$"
2021-05-26 23:42:55,wallstreetbets,"Wrong! If the shareholders say I want $300 for my shares then they cannot cover at $100, $10 or $1. They can manipulate the price wherever they want in a low liquidity environment to try and entice you to sell but only if someone wants to sell at whatever price it's currently trading can they cover.

The price is just the last traded price. So if you have to cover 30M shares and you spend all day jacking each other off passing 1k shares around at $100 and there are 30M shares for sale at $300 then what price can you cover at?"
2021-05-26 23:59:01,wallstreetbets,Did you just join up yesterday or did you miss the several times in the last few months GME and AMC both took huge weekly hits? They've spent more days in the red than in the green. It's great if you bought at a low but anyone buying at this point is jumping in on the high. Good luck to you lol.
2021-05-27 02:14:07,wallstreetbets,"Adjust your withholding, if you're getting triple digit returns or more you're giving them an interest free loan then paying taxes on it when you get it back. My personal best was 4 owed to state and 7 back from the fed."
2021-05-27 09:12:42,wallstreetbets,The irs is an inside revenue job
2021-05-27 09:36:33,wallstreetbets,"No. You seem to have missed the word reduced.

So our capital gains here operates a bit differently. Taxes are calculated the same as income, and capital gains means you only pay half of whatever the taxes would have been. So if you make like 60k a year, and then make 60k profit from investments, you would pay your regular taxes on your 60k from your job, but only half the taxes on the second 60k from your investments. The second 60k would partially fall into a different tax bracket. So it would work out to something like paying 11% federal tax on that second 60k. Can't remember what the brackets are for each province, but it would tack on probably another 6% effective tax rate or so for where I live. Basically, if you're not rich, it ends up at quite a nice tax rate.

In a TFSA you pay literally no taxes on any profit. Ever. No minimum time to hold, you just can't day trade to abuse the lack of taxes, and there is a limit(currently something like $76k invested in TFSA's, raises every year). But if you buy something one day, and it goes up a nice percentage the next day, hell, even the same day, the CRA won't ding you for selling. Just has to be a reasonable context for the sale, like the aforementioned situation.

While your lower rate for a longer hold is interesting, IMO it's straight garbage because it locks your capital for long periods of time and causes massive opportunity loss where we don't have that financial prison in Canada."
2021-05-27 08:34:01,wallstreetbets,Isnt it 30% for less than one year?
2021-05-27 09:32:43,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Zero difference between a week and 80 years.

TFSA's have zero taxes on profits. You just can't day trade in them, and there's a limit to how much you can invest(cap is like 76k invested or something like that, and that cap does not reset until you've sold and have entered the next tax year)"

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PATH TLDR - Great market growth, awesome fundamentals, great product & retention, exciting TA set up.

**What I'm doing**: Averaging in slowly in preparation for the 10D EMA to come in in preparation for another leg higher.

Market

* **The RPA Market is growing rapidly**: GVR estimates the global robotic process automation market to grow at 34% CAGR through 2028 while Gartner estimates it to grow at over 24% YoY CAGR - to $600B, through 2022 ([source](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-04-28-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-hyperautomation-enabling-software-market-to-reach-nearly-600-billion-by-2022)) and expects $PATH to grow at 33% CAGR ([source](https://www.uipath.com/resources/automation-analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-robotic-process-automation))
* **$PATH dominates the most important regions for RPA**: North America (accounts for 37% of global RPA spend ([source](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market)) and as of January 31, 2021, $PATH had 7,968 customers, including 80% of the Fortune 10 and 63% of the Fortune Global 500 ([source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_9))

Company & Financials

* **$PATH can expect high levels of current customer retention**: UiPath has an NPS (Net Promoter Score) of 71 over the past 12 mo period, lightyears beyond the industry average of 39 ([Source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521125014/d98556d424b4.htm#rom98556_4), [Source](https://www.retently.com/blog/good-net-promoter-score/))
* **Strong revenue growth:** $PATH is experiencing YoY Revenue growth of over 80%
* **Strong profitability growth:** While $PATH grows revenues at over 80% YoY, their cost of revenue only grows at \~13% YoY. EBITDA Margin is growing at 88% YoY - $PATH will begin capturing large profits in the next year ([source](https://app.koyfin.com/fa/fa.is/eq-08u9m6))

TA & Entry

* $PATH has consolidated off it's IPO highs
* $PATH has tested these highs multiple times and is forming a nice support
* Traders are waiting for 10D EMA to catch up before accepting another run

Has to be shopify right? Why hasn't it already happened? Maybe shopify doesn't want to sell? But if that is the case, hostile t/o is in cards like what happened with ebay / paypal split? Ebay didn't want to split ebay and paypal so Carl Ican forced their hand

2021-05-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GMG Ngl this seems like a prettt solid play rn low volume and it’s just been on the slow and steady rise 

This is a real game-changing technology which can offer a real alternative with an interchangeable battery technology for the existing lithium-ion batteries in almost every application with GMG’s Graphene and UQ’s patent-pending aluminum ion battery technology. The current nominal voltage of our batteries is 1.7 volts, and work is being carried out to increase the voltage to directly replace existing batteries and which lead to higher energy densities.

The real differentiator about these batteries is their very high power density of up to 7000 watts/kg, which endows them with a very high charge rate. Furthermore, graphene aluminum-ion batteries provide major benefits in terms of longer battery life (over 2000 charge / discharge cycles testing so far with no deterioration in performance), battery safety (very low fire potential) and lower environmental impact (more recyclable).

graph looks good. good buy. but if u want idk. not a professional buy at ur own risk. yeah.🚀."
2021-05-27 00:40:36,wallstreetbets,"Okay! Breakfast came early for You GMG.V Bulls. Its Pencil lead, not crayons today though, although Im hoping that someone with Market DD will post here in a bit and make us some fresh hot crayons. this is my first time on here doing anything like this, so go easy on me:

So here's some stuff I was able to get:  
  
The only person with a science background That I can really find is their CSO:  
  
Ashock Kumar Nanjundan CSO:  
Pukyong National University  
Degree Name: Doctor of Engineering  
Materials Science  
Current Adjunct professor at Queensland University (Gotta Do Something for the Kids Right)  
  
Publications:   
  
I’ll Let you guys go to sci hub to download this review for yourself, But the TLDR is that this dude knows his shit on how to dope graphene to get it to work as a battery.   
Cited by: 178, For less academic Apes this means that 178 other scientists were like “yeah this dude knows his shit, Imma cite what he’s saying \~basically\~ as fact.   
https://doi.org/10.1039/C6EE00158K  
  
Ashock’s most cited individual work comes from his first post-doc that he completed in Korea.  
Polyaniline-Grafted Reduced Graphene Oxide for Efficient Electrochemical Supercapacitors.   
Basically he does some pretty no-brainer synthesys to link graphene and another semi-conducting polymer that really enhances the graphene properties (Pretty nobrainer basic polymer bro shit, even so, it look like he probably wrote good supporting info and saved a lot of people a lot of time).  
https://doi.org/10.1021/nn204688c  
  
Total citations for all work combined: 3,845  
This is pretty damn good for someone so young.   
  
Here is a research paper that I'm having trouble accessing that seems to be relevant to this company's work on aluminum-graphene based batteries. If anyone can find it, DM me!  
https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202010569  
  
All in all, based on what I can see from linkedin about this company, they have a great CSO. He does seem to be both teaching and doing research in academia. He was recently brought up from a “Head Product Scientist” role to a CSO role, so hopefully this change will reflect a move away from more general research and towards really developing this stuff for GMG.V  
  
I’m concerned about product development at this company, specifically it's unclear who is managing it. I’m not able to see every employee linkedin, but it may be that one of the people not visible is leading product development. You might be thinking \~but wait\~ what if there is a group of slave PHD students/postdocs at the university of Queensland working on this stuff?  Yes there is. Nanjundan has some connections with the YU group ([https://aibn.uq.edu.au/yu.)](https://aibn.uq.edu.au/yu.)) And then here is a press release about it. (https://graphenemg.com/gmg-the-university-of-queensland-research-uni-quest-kick-off-the-graphene-enhanced-aluminium-ion-battery-development-project/)  
  
It sounds like the company has recently had some really good results in R&D, but until I can see and Audit the product/process development lead, ill probably avoid going all in $$.   
  
 \~sometimes\~ the COO role at these companies can be a technical role that helps with process development, but the COO looks to be doing mostly operations type stuff and is non-technical. Not wholly worrisome, but I do want to see  more listed employees on linkedin and then someone that is leading doing process development/scale up and quality control… quality assurance wouldn't hurt either.     
  
It also looks like this company is casting a wide net of potential products, but it's entirely unclear if it has launched any of them. Hopefully it does. It feels uncommon these days for a company to go the IPO route so early on in R&D, most will look to do venture capital funding first to launch a few products. Is this an australian thing? Or is this just crowdfunding with extra steps? If you have more info, lets talk  
  
I'm a materials science ape and don't know anything about Stock Market DD, but why not rely on science DD to decide on investments?"
2021-05-27 17:44:19,wallstreetbets,Any idea where I can get into this? RH doesn't seem to support it - but I need to leave RH after the current squeeze anyways.

2021-05-27 03:18:25,wallstreetbets,"They have to cut emissions from their own activities, and also from the product they sell so it's going to be global. Also They are a Dutch British company the Dutch royal family is in it. So it will have an effect.

And this could lead to similar court cases started by climate activists in different countries. You can't count on Bubba from Texas with his NRA card shooting any activist starting a court case in the head because Marjory Taylor Green and Sean Hannity told him climate activists are baby eating communists or something. 

In other countries activists will be able to start court cases and some of these they'll win.

2021-05-26 20:23:20,wallstreetbets,I have never wanted to prove my wife wrong more. She told me today I was stupid for buying AMC (Bought in months back aroun $7.5). Honestly the money is secondary to being right in this situation.

2021-05-26 23:14:03,wallstreetbets,"Amc is nowhere near the squeeze yet. This is just the beginning. Amc will be over 1000 dollars , it will be epic"
2021-05-26 23:16:26,wallstreetbets,Amc is going to squeeze in a crazy way. Will make history .

2021-05-27 00:01:51,wallstreetbets,"So we are holding AMC. We blew past the 14.50$ mark. That hit HF hard. Now our next HF screw point 24.50$. 

Can we legit hit 24.50$ and if so after can we then expect to see the same % gains as we see GME?

2021-05-26 20:53:47,wallstreetbets,this gentleman obviously engages in cortus.
2021-05-26 20:58:25,wallstreetbets,You guys need to have the balls to yolo before something booms. It’s why you always bag hold.
2021-05-26 20:59:27,wallstreetbets,So you bought at the very top??? Haha
2021-05-26 21:18:01,wallstreetbets,"I’m in @ $12.90 and also @ $15+ and I don’t feel like selling anytime soon 😎

2021-05-26 20:32:22,wallstreetbets,I have a feeling they might wanna push this up in the guise of “short squeeze” then do a short attack on it so everyone panics and sell. Crash and burn. I have faith though!

2021-05-27 11:20:08,wallstreetbets,U a special type of idiot brother👐💎
2021-05-26 21:49:47,wallstreetbets,what i meant was i bought 100 shares of AMC when the price was $7. i'm not sure how that got misinterpreted. i am retarded though. but i also have 5 shares of GME that i bought at $60.
2021-05-27 08:26:32,wallstreetbets,I like those Apples (in my Matt Damon voice)
2021-05-26 22:48:39,wallstreetbets,I bought at 14 in like Jan and felt super retarded. Averaged it down a tiny bit buying at 6 when it dipped.  Now I’m feeling kinda less retarded. But not much.
2021-05-27 10:36:00,wallstreetbets,"You are not alone. I bought 50 @ 14 too. Went down right after that, for weeks haha. until now"
2021-05-27 00:51:44,wallstreetbets,"Felt completely confident selling at buying at 7 and selling at 15, I look like a huge retard now."
2021-05-26 22:15:04,wallstreetbets,I bought more today and averages up from $10 to $12
2021-05-26 23:50:55,wallstreetbets,50 @ 5.50 back in Feb. It's quite the ride.
2021-05-27 10:35:30,wallstreetbets,I have 50 @ 14. Kinda glad this is happening :)
2021-05-27 08:54:09,wallstreetbets,"Never look back

That’s my biggest problem"
2021-05-27 00:58:43,wallstreetbets,I sold at 10.33!! After holding for monthsssss. Ughhhhh!!!
2021-05-27 09:18:08,wallstreetbets,Same feel like a fucking idiot been beating myself over it
2021-05-27 11:10:47,wallstreetbets,Update: we’re here for you.  Will you ride with us?
2021-05-26 23:43:07,wallstreetbets,"Same except at $14.

2021-05-26 23:10:27,wallstreetbets,Well sure. I think they do that to most stocks. That’s the game that’s played. A majority of investors don’t have the intestinal fortitude to hold through a huge dip. They know this and that’s how they get the best of the average person. I was one of those suckers when I first started investing. Haha. Learned my lesson.
2021-05-26 23:26:34,wallstreetbets,LETS GOOO! I HEAR THE FLOOR IS 9 MILLY 🦍🦍🦍

2021-05-26 20:35:51,wallstreetbets,"Every share helps, you're doing your part for a big squeeze. You'll do better than a YOY 3% return in a retirement account 🤘"
2021-05-26 20:42:16,wallstreetbets,"I'm quite pleased with it, but I just meant I'm not holding hundreds or thousands of shares (wish I was lol)"
2021-05-26 21:37:48,wallstreetbets,I bought amc @ 2.50 and sold at 11 🤷‍♂️
2021-05-27 01:51:20,wallstreetbets,Lmao no thanks man.  I moved my money out of AMERITRADE and over to PayPal to buy some ETH.  I need a break from that rollercoaster.  I hope that shit goes to Pluto though!  🚀

2021-05-26 20:50:26,wallstreetbets,"I had $16 6/4 but rolled to $21 7/18 to pay for my wendys today. With this IV, I’ll roll again if needed."

2021-05-26 21:19:53,wallstreetbets,"If you keep having to roll (aka you’re selling a covered call and buying it back for more than you paid) are you really making bank? I get the future date pays more premium, but there’s also less liquidity on those. 

And selling cash secured puts on the way down? Why would you sell close to the money puts on a stock going down? Like yeah, you get some premium, but then you get assigned?

I sell covered calls on stock I expect to trade sideways or down so I can buy back and close at a profit, not a stock flying upwards where I need to keep losing money rolling it out."

2021-05-27 00:25:27,wallstreetbets,"First and foremost, I ate the wrappers on all of my crayons and as a result, haven't seen a written word in years.  I'm barely literate and this is not financial advice.

There are two types of apes.

First ape is victory or death.  This is personal.   The sell button is broken.  The money is gone. We lit it up and we are dancing around the fire.  This ape will starve before selling a single share.

The second ape just wants to make a few bucks and will sell to pay rent like a paper handed bitch.  They buy, sell, buy, sell, slither like snek up down up down, many options, always looking out for themselves.  They will band together with the first ape so long as it is profitable short-term, but the first sign of danger and they're out.

reddit is a meta-conscious self-organized collective that has transcended unicellular life and become a God unto itself, capable of standing in the world of hedgefunds and governments, an abstract realm where mortals cannot tread.  Together the apes stand.  Together the apes hold.  Together.  Apes. Strong.

&#x200B;

No bullshit, there's a rumor going around that AMC or GME may come away from their upcoming shareholder votes with smoking-gun proof that their stock is being illegally manipulated by short-sellers, market makers, hedge funds, and various alphabet agencies.

World 1)  Reddit is fighting a crusade against short-selling.  In a fair and just world, this alone would be understandable and a worthy cause where large companies bet on failure and create financial incentives to help bring about said failures.

World 2)  Reddit is fighting a crusade against a system so evil, so corrupt, so disgusting, so revolting, that to expose it for even a moment could bring the entire house of cards tumbling down if even a small fraction of the world pays even the slightest bit of attention to what is about to unfold in the coming months.  Reddit is about to blow the lid off naked shorting in a way that cannot be ignored by Congress, the SEC, and the major players in our financial markets.   They're going to get squeezed in the market and then bled dry in court.  Someone or something is going to die.  Either the hedgefunds stand victorious over the limp corpses of our movies and video games, or the hivemind of Reddit takes this bossfight seriously.

Reddit just proved to itself that the GME short squeeze wasn't a meme.  The second squeeze will see significantly fewer apes paperhanding like bitches.  Reddit took a shot in the dark and hit the pinata and candy fell out.  Reddit wouldn't have noticed a thing, but the hedgefunds had to swing back.  They hit us.  They think it hurt, but all it did was prove they were real, and that this is a real fight.  they tried to suspend buy orders.   They should have just stayed silent and hidden in a corner, in the dark, under a rock, like they're used to, but they're getting confident.   They hit us, and we felt it.  No longer a phantom in the night, we have a real adversary before us.  We took a swing and it hit, and they swung back, and now they're fucked.  Apes aren't just looking for a few pieces of candy anymore, now we're coming for the whole fucking store.

I would never consider fighting in any war for any government for any reason.  I have no quarrel with the people of this world.

I would gladly walk into battle against a hedge fund hellbent on destroying a company illegally for profit.  I am the first ape.  This is the second world.  There will be no third squeeze.

Edit and ps:  


OR:  ( and I think every ape needs to genuinely consider the possibility...)

World 3)  reddit is pyramid-scheme bag-holding popular and trendy meme stocks, and earlier investors only make money when fresh meat comes walking through the door and eventually the music will stop and many of the apes will be left with significantly less than they started.  AMC doesn't have any proof of anything illegal, Adam Aron is a memester who conned reddit for a bump in share price so he could refi some debt at a better market price, because he's the CEO and that's literally his job to push his stock higher.   The SEC will never release any public statement, naked shorting doesn't happen, congress doesn't do anything, and the music never stops.

The entire squeeze(the 100k/share lambo squeeze) in my mind, is predicated on whether or not AMC and the SEC have smoking-gun proof of insider collusion and naked shorting.  Without that, this is nothing more than a $25/share I-can-pay-my-rent squeeze.

When Adam Aron comes out on June 30 and says ""Hey guys, there are only XXX shares of our company, but we received XXX \* 3 votes at our shareholder meeting, how can this happen?!""  and the SEC comes out and says ""Hey Citadel, we have a few questions""  I expect this stock to leave the solar system."

2021-05-27 02:10:28,wallstreetbets,I never said it did. I just said with a market cap at its highest value ever it doesn't reflect the business at all
2021-05-27 14:26:32,wallstreetbets,If you did your DD you got nothing to worry about. If you are a newbie that go no idea what ur doing then sure you will panic when it dips lol. The og apes aren’t scared of no dips lmao most of us have averages of 7-10$
2021-05-27 00:03:43,wallstreetbets,"If I had to guess, I'd say many of them FOMOd in over $14 and don't want to hear anything other than confirmation bias.


Fucking apes have ruined this sub. I tried telling y'all in January that $400+ GME was a dangerous spot and received pretty much the same reaction. Oh well, just gotta wait for it crash, idiots to learn their lesson (again), and then maybe one day the sub can be usable again. 


I mean damn, we got people in here that don't know what fucking *market cap* is, buying shares thinking they're gonna get rich off of it. One day people will look back and realize how dumb all this was. Until then, anything other than the most braindead shit screaming about how it's going to 100k will get downvoted to oblivion."
2021-05-26 23:39:52,wallstreetbets,"People don't realize that. It's great to be hopefully and all, but. . . I bought in at $14 in late January. Between then and now, alot of shit has happened in my life, so I sold and made $100. Could I have held longer and got more? Maybe. But I'd rather not take the chance of it crashing again after months of being down over a hundred dollars."

The TLDR;  The upcoming shareholder vote is really fucking important and everyone who owns stock needs to vote to have their voices heard.  This is more important than democracy itself.  We need 100% of retail investors to have their voices heard, to stand up and be counted, because that very count is all the proof we need to take these sneks for all their worth."

2021-05-27 10:06:49,wallstreetbets,"OP and others, AMC under 40 per share is a bargain! It will hit 100 per share within the next 3-4 weeks - in my smooth brain retard ass brain. I failed algebra in high school and college - not a financial advisor only a sexual pleaser - ask your wife about me"
2021-05-27 10:42:56,wallstreetbets,If amc goes to 120 bucks per share it would be sooo awesome. My first 1000 dollar made on the Wallstreet.

2021-05-27 00:08:21,wallstreetbets,I don't even know why I'm reading this crap it's not even worth sifting through to find useful educational tools. It's like 99% crap. This is a crap stock in a dieing market that was bankrupt shortly ago I think from reading on here at least. Movies have been dieing for the last decade. And if any comeback happened than it is now short lived and would certainly be now. The fad will die with the excitement of the economy reopening and people will once again fade away from the theaters. At their fingertips is unfortunately where most people prefer to see what they want to see and whenever they please. Blockbuster.
2021-05-27 12:06:55,wallstreetbets,"AMC is a joke 

Learn to actually invest"
2021-05-27 13:02:53,wallstreetbets,Let me know when it gets there so I can short that POS

2021-05-27 10:17:43,wallstreetbets,Clearly the answer is masturbate. What else would you do with your hands?
2021-05-27 10:22:08,wallstreetbets,"I’m selling at NO LESS than 50K per share, because FUCK ALL. I’m tired of getting out of bed for less than $10K"
2021-05-27 10:57:15,wallstreetbets,"Do not sell! They are trying to dupe us! 2 June the shareholders speak (as I hope and am sure you all know as well) however if in case you don’t, contact your broker for your voting papers (I’m  Australian so i don’t know how it works for everyone) ASAP! It’s important so the true share holdings and synthetic holdings can be exposed. Then the fraud can start being exposed but we have to be together in this and fight against the corruption and theft."
2021-05-27 10:28:37,wallstreetbets,What is happening this Friday
2021-05-27 10:43:26,wallstreetbets,That's why I just instant deposited and margin called myself...if they want their money back they're going to have to fill my sell order lmao....\*eats crayon\*

2021-05-26 20:03:07,wallstreetbets,"I’m a retarded ape, not a financial advisor. 

But it’s probably because you put in your purchase order after hours and it will fill your order when the markets open at whatever the available price is"
2021-05-27 11:06:19,wallstreetbets,I bought 50 more shares when it opened and they are currently up $220 so it’s up to you but I’ll buy more on pay day
2021-05-27 08:37:27,wallstreetbets,You must be new to wsb and meme stocks.

2021-05-27 01:04:21,wallstreetbets,"Nope. You are all dipshits. They have been counting for months, the share count comes out on the 2nd. Just hold and shut up."
2021-05-26 22:35:31,wallstreetbets,"Lol I was thinking that, like trillions of dollars would have to be paid out"

2021-05-27 10:55:16,wallstreetbets,I think that they made Pluto a planet again....
2021-05-26 21:38:31,wallstreetbets,In NM the state they still recognize it as a planet.
2021-05-27 11:03:36,wallstreetbets,It think they said Pluto is a moon of Uranus.  That works better for us Apes anyway
2021-05-27 11:00:29,wallstreetbets,I guess another way to consider things is who has stolen trillions and trillions off us normal people before.... might not get that good but Robin Hood.... transfer of wealth. Funny that trading platform was one of the first to block gme.... ironic really
2021-05-27 10:47:05,wallstreetbets,We're making it a planet anyways!!
2021-05-27 14:01:33,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, but I would prefer if the whales 🐳 purchased AMC and GME instead."
2021-05-27 11:14:33,wallstreetbets,"Poor Pluto...today you’re a planet, tomorrow you’re not, but now you are again ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm). Can they just make up their minds already."
2021-05-27 13:44:02,wallstreetbets,"it was a planet until liberal shitbags decided to downgrade it.. i say "" fuck them""  "" planet planet planet planet ""  i've had about enough of people trying to tell me what and how to think. so like a good ape i throw shit right back at them."
2021-05-26 20:43:21,wallstreetbets,I think you're on track with NCLH. I think it will recover to pre-COVID pricing.
2021-05-27 15:57:27,wallstreetbets,"Just when I think I cant get any dumber, I read something like this. Good luck"
2021-05-26 22:54:56,wallstreetbets,"Because I started with 3.7K, so this is just play money."
2021-05-26 22:56:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but the thing is... while I have enough time in my contracts to be right? I think so.🤡"
2021-05-26 22:41:31,wallstreetbets,"I've got a list that are doing well atm, and Express is one of them."
2021-05-27 01:29:29,wallstreetbets,It's up like 15%
2021-05-26 20:16:15,wallstreetbets,20 million sir. 20 million per share. Then we know it’s a squeeze
2021-05-26 23:40:47,wallstreetbets,It's all about point the stars and you will definitely hit the moon
2021-05-27 06:20:20,wallstreetbets,U think dude shoved a banana up his ass for 1k
2021-05-26 21:38:35,wallstreetbets,And here
2021-05-26 20:58:20,wallstreetbets,"I'm pro-GME, but I hope you realize that's not ever going to happen. That would literally destroy the entire US financial system (more than it already is)."
2021-05-26 21:01:25,wallstreetbets,No it wouldn’t actually the payout would be 4 trillion. These bitches are gonna have to fork up the bill. What they gonna do just halt it and say heyyyyy guys it was getting too high so we stopped it. We thought you couldn’t all handle any more money lol. I don’t think so man. How do you see this playing out.
2021-05-27 02:43:57,wallstreetbets,Lol don’t both arguing with these idiots.
2021-05-26 21:19:42,wallstreetbets,"I mean...the bullshit with Robinhood literally halted the first GME squeeze and ruined it, otherwise I don't doubt it would've soared past $1000. But with the way the SEC doesn't do shit that it's supposed to, I 100% believe that ""the powers that be"" have the ability to prevent the shares from ever going past, say $10k per share. Thats an arbitrary number, but seriously, millions of dollars PER SHARE, not happening..."
2021-05-26 23:10:51,wallstreetbets,The government will step in. I mean look throughout history. In 2008 how many of these rich assholes go broke or to jail?  It’s a rigged game. If they’re losing too bad they’ll change the rules.
2021-05-26 21:21:46,wallstreetbets,How can they stop it? There’s no reasons anyone can give that these powers can stop it. Brokers can pull fuckery like robinhood but hopefully most apes got off those shitty brokers anyways.
2021-05-26 20:32:31,wallstreetbets,so what doesit MEAN!!
2021-05-27 06:16:18,wallstreetbets,Bro I'm with u we own the float x even as low as 2 the price is what we say it is
2021-05-26 21:37:32,wallstreetbets,Even with the short % it won’t reach that. It’s physically not possible
2021-05-26 20:36:18,wallstreetbets,"Thought you were just saying you’re retarded lol it means people are going to hold onto their shares until GME hits 20mil. Who knows how high it will actually go, but the longer people hold without selling, the higher the price will continue to push"
2021-05-27 00:25:53,wallstreetbets,To wait after peak and sell at the floor of XX million USD.
2021-05-26 22:50:10,wallstreetbets,What is the chance this run goes above $25 tomorrow?  I get nervous around the weekend and sell-offs.
2021-05-26 21:28:19,wallstreetbets,"I can't wait to keep holding at $50.

2021-05-27 11:32:36,wallstreetbets,and then almost everyone is up about 10x lol
2021-05-27 11:20:17,wallstreetbets,Absolutely let me figure out how to link a photo on my phone
2021-05-27 11:25:09,wallstreetbets,"Ugh Ok i don't know how to update my photo or add another from my phone.  Sold one option at $9.60 this AM so I have 12 left now sitting at $11,160 total with a profit of $10,312 or 1200%!"
2021-05-27 14:05:22,wallstreetbets,I am so proud of these retards

2021-05-27 11:36:21,wallstreetbets,I Will write an article about BB to help to get out of this disaster tomorrow.
2021-05-27 12:14:44,wallstreetbets,holy fuck 1200%? congrats man.
2021-05-27 11:31:09,wallstreetbets,"Ok well if you're looking for a serious answer I 100% would not start with a speculative stock like this.  I saw that it was trending down and bought a lot of options on the chance we'd get a turnaround so like when it was $10/share.  If you jump into Meme stocks right now you should expect to lose and have a $1000 lesson.  I would recommend starting with something safe and easy that you're not going to have these types of swings.  It will give you an opportunity to learn about the greets and what time decay is and IV.  Youtube learning options to get the basics and go onto /r/options to buy some safe ones at first.  I'd get into something like FCX or MT that are companies doing extremely well this year and most likely going to go up slowly and actually give you a higher probability of a win.  This $$ I invested was completely disposable income and I was willing to lose all of it.  Get an account on Fidelity, NOT ROBINHOOD, and apply for options and throw $1,000 into it and I can DM you and try to help you find some options that expire in like September which will give you a few months to see it go up and down.  I got extremely lucky here and have taken all of my initial investment and am just letting my profit ride the wave right now.  I'm not a stock broker just a dumb ape that wants to stick it to the man."
2021-05-27 11:40:37,wallstreetbets,Yessssss!
2021-05-27 12:21:46,wallstreetbets,Thanks! first 10 bagger in awhile!  I've sold about 8 contracts as it was going up but holding my 9/17 options strong right now.

2021-05-26 23:48:43,wallstreetbets,"Like a lot of other people are saying he bought the top yada yada. If you look at his portfolio there is some really good lesson here for people.

The date he bought all of these was Jan 27th if you look at the historical prices. he probably spent everything he had on that day FOMO'ing into these stocks WSB was going crazy for.

1st mistake is they are all WSB plays which this sub sucks at.

2 spent all his ammo at the same time. Why do people do this ? if you like a stock DCA into it slowly over time  

3 spread it out where is MSFT, V, UNH ect ect"

Not even trying to be mean, but this honestly might be the stupidest fucking portfolio I've ever seen. It's quite the achievement OP.

2021-05-27 07:42:30,wallstreetbets,"Seriously. OP, next time try and experiment, and when you get excited to buy into something, buy puts instead and see what happens. Post results for karma."
2021-05-26 23:53:25,wallstreetbets,"His problem is the companies he bought, not when he bought. Buying dips is just as dangerous as buying when a stock is potentially overbought. Bullish stocks with good fundamentals ready to break out are good to buy when they near ATH’s because they have potential to blow past it and make a run. If your strategy is only buying dips on shitty companies you’ll be catching falling knives eventually."

2021-05-27 00:16:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this is *almost* as bad as that person who bought impossible options on rumors from a Q-anon forum. I mean this isn't even close to being as stupid, but his ability to buy at the very top of seemingly everything is downright impressive."
2021-05-27 07:54:15,wallstreetbets,"At least let us know when you're going to buy something.

People like OP are actually pretty valuable. I have a FUDlord-would-be-millionaire coworker. He's great with analytics, sees breakouts well before anyone else consistently, doesn't buy-in, misses out on the tendies, and then FOMOs himself into a truly smooth-brained position after the fact. When we talk shop I always ask him what he's following and if he's bought in yet."
2021-05-27 00:13:31,wallstreetbets,The funny thing is there's a pretty good chance he makes a killing overall.
2021-05-26 23:42:50,wallstreetbets,Only if he doesn't fuck it up by selling though
2021-05-27 18:40:36,wallstreetbets,"I believe so too, but he bought at the top. Now he will need time to get his money back and make some gainz."

Nobody tells you where to go from here

Seems like fate's pulling you

Decisions have to be made

The best path is the hardest earned


There is so much at stake

I stumble, I lose my place

Pride and arrogance surrounded by sin

Destiny takes its hold

Fight it or let it go

But I choose how today will end


Back and forth the struggle consumes us all

Trying to keep a level head

In the most unsettling of times

next we (and also I) need all of your help at Wereldhave (WER) ISIN: NL0000289213 / WKN: 853289.  
This is a huge Shopping Center Company. Was at 90 EUR \~ 109,72 USD per share when Shorters and manipulaters started to fuck us. Net Asset Value per share is somewhere around 40 EUR, 0,5 EUR Dividend, used to be 2,5 EUR and more in the passed years. Somehow the price is always going down, now at 15 EUR = 18,29 USD (!), although its value is much higher and nobody is really selling shares. They have always been setting an ""ex-dividend"", but never used to price the earnings in again (for decades !!!!) although the company is earning good money and everybody is holding and buying (hereby meaning private investors). Shorters are not able to buy back the outstanding shares anymore but somehow the stock is not rising..

By the way: This is where Gamestop stores are located in :)"

Academy has a much smaller footprint (1/3 the # of stores) as Dicks so will be more nimble and much more capable of growing.  They are paying down debt and selling mountains of gear, not to mention the are the go to for team uniforms in a reopening economy.
DKS earnings is shining a light on ASO and people will take notice of this underdog. It doesnt deserve a p/e of 9 when it is a more valuable company.  
My bet is 47 before earnings, 60 after. That will bring them closer to the DKS  P/E. Then as it outruns DKS financially it will continue to grow.  90 in a year? It's almost tripled in the last year so that would just be continuing the trend. 

 I'm long ASO. Have some calls too."

2021-05-26 20:18:12,wallstreetbets,"If you're looking for chump change? $50-100

If you're looking for chimp change? $500-1000

If you're looking for life changing ape change? $100k-500k

You decide when you want to sell. Whether or not you regret that decision, if it goes higher...well that's also on you."
2021-05-26 22:38:45,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding out for $300, will sell 90 shares then. Keeping 10 shares for giggles.  Sure wish I bought more at under 10 lmao"

2021-05-27 01:14:52,wallstreetbets,"Keep in mind, amc is already very high so its very fragile and could dip really hard. Still a good buy if there is any dip"

2021-05-26 22:51:02,wallstreetbets,I bet it feels good tonight
2021-05-27 17:18:50,wallstreetbets,"I have 450 shares of AMC, been selling 3 calls the past few months at a $20 strike price to make some extra cash. Wasn’t expecting this pop at all, my calls expire tomorrow and I really don’t expect AMC to close below $20 tomorrow. Should I hope for a slight dip or just buy back my calls when the market opens tomorrow."
2021-05-26 20:53:14,wallstreetbets,Put a sock on the door 🚪
2021-05-26 21:23:24,wallstreetbets,"those are leaps, 12/17.... this man practically bought shares. hes good. And there not even OTM..."

2021-05-27 18:20:17,wallstreetbets,Haha yea. Normalized winning.
2021-05-27 02:04:17,wallstreetbets,This has got to be one of the dumbest things I have ever read in this sub. Truly retarded. Truly.

2021-05-27 18:22:28,wallstreetbets,"Lol I know. Good luck to you too. I think I’ve decided to just be happy with my 300 shares selling at $20 then riding my 150 out to the moon. Gotta remember, Bulls make money, Bears make money but Pigs get slaughtered."
2021-05-26 21:48:27,wallstreetbets,We do it !!
2021-05-26 20:37:04,wallstreetbets,What about WeBull?

2021-05-26 21:04:16,wallstreetbets,Bearish then. Ok
2021-05-27 09:03:55,wallstreetbets,Nah. Don’t think AMC will take me there
2021-05-26 20:53:13,wallstreetbets,Never mind! I’m a retard! Already been said! 🤦🏻‍♂️
2021-05-27 02:53:26,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-26 21:06:12,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a meme Stonk what goes up comes down. I played the up last time. Now I’m playing the down.
2021-05-26 21:01:33,wallstreetbets,Shit you made me sin. Stop it
2021-05-26 21:08:01,wallstreetbets,Ok
2021-05-26 21:08:39,wallstreetbets,This is manipulated GL
2021-05-26 21:36:51,wallstreetbets,What's the minimum?
2021-05-27 10:14:33,wallstreetbets,How's your flash crash?
2021-05-27 02:52:21,wallstreetbets,"For what? Fidelity has no minimum deposit to begin trading, but unlike Robinhood, they don't jam you directly into a margin account - the default is a cash-based account. not sure what your question is?"
2021-05-27 12:14:10,wallstreetbets,"Hilarious. Petty internet people are fun, I haven’t thought twice about this post but you have. Happy you’ve summited Everest!"
2021-05-26 20:23:32,wallstreetbets,"Yep, $4000 worth of 7/16 puts here at different strikes"
2021-05-27 02:19:32,wallstreetbets,Tell that to late January. I’m long GME since December they’ve done it before
2021-05-26 20:54:09,wallstreetbets,Yea hope so. Also hope my greed does get me… where I exit the call positions and let the shares ride all the way up. But i feel good either way about my options whichever way things lean
2021-05-27 10:28:58,wallstreetbets,I’m kind of regretting the covered call I sold. I knew this thing would go to the moon. If you have an idea on how to gracefully exit the covered call let me know. But either way I’m winning so not a huge regret
2021-05-26 20:37:11,wallstreetbets,Sell off in PINS has been ridiculous the last few weeks. That partnership with IKEA is just the start of some nice catalysts.
2021-05-26 22:31:38,wallstreetbets,That’s what i’m saying. Price anchoring.
2021-05-26 22:24:28,wallstreetbets,That shit will print so hard for you
2021-05-27 00:28:02,wallstreetbets,That's how it's done
2021-05-27 12:58:47,wallstreetbets,"This stock is garbage. No one is buying this company and it makes no money. Doesn’t seem like anyone wants the tech, they been trying to sell it for years now. TSLA even specifically stated they going away from lidaar and focusing on vision cameras only... I don’t see the appeal at all."
2021-05-27 09:04:11,wallstreetbets,"I did switch to WeBull, but came back because I prefer the Robinhood app. The WeBull app isn’t all bad… it does give you a lot more advanced charting features… but the app is also cluttered, unintuitive, and constantly being rearranged, so it’s a lot more tedious to just get in and do some of the very basic things that the Robinhood app is very good at."
2021-05-26 20:41:47,wallstreetbets,BBroke gang here reporting for duty
2021-05-26 20:43:43,wallstreetbets,"USPS had been worse for me, can I short the federal government?"
2021-05-26 21:10:58,wallstreetbets,"Not allowing you to unionize is illegal, regardless of the state you live in. Try to find the labor posters that are given for the company. And visit the [National Labor Relations Board's website](https://www.nlrb.gov/) to get more information about your labor rights (it helped me and some fellow employees at the bank I currently work at).

edit* the reason companies can fire you for discussing unionizing is cause you're on the job in the work place. Discussion of it outside of the workplace when not on the clock is the standard.

*not legal or financial advice*"
2021-05-26 21:48:22,wallstreetbets,Yes don't pay taxes
2021-05-26 21:20:25,wallstreetbets,"This is good to know, its just getting the little guys, the package handlers, to become aware of this on a mass level and getting them to care, and to resist managements attempts at suppression"
2021-05-27 10:31:28,wallstreetbets,Anyone know why GE's popping off today?
2021-05-27 18:53:23,wallstreetbets,"I am pretty new to options and trying to understand this. What buy price, stock price and expiry does one need to get this kind of gains?"
2021-05-26 23:29:57,wallstreetbets,"Why do people go out to eat when they can cook at home?

People pay for the experience. Also, the masks are being phased out. Even if they weren’t last time I check theaters have air conditioning lol"
2021-05-26 20:38:12,wallstreetbets,Smh
2021-05-26 23:32:13,wallstreetbets,Yea but it’s still hot outside hun I can’t walk through that
2021-05-27 16:18:51,wallstreetbets,Who’s making you wear a mask outside? That’s your own choice and fault.
2021-05-27 19:19:48,wallstreetbets,Whaddy think about them apples? Hedge fund manager.
2021-05-27 15:40:18,wallstreetbets,“You too” isn’t a valid argument.
2021-05-26 20:37:46,wallstreetbets,If you are gonna say stupid and ignorant comments like what you just did I won’t answer any question you ask. Bye hun

2021-05-26 20:53:51,wallstreetbets,"I guess all that was necessary for a catalyst was for me to go on Reddit and crudely say BlackBerry was a bad investment for the universe to swiftly show me how little I know lol. Yes, this is sarcasm. I had a minuscule part to play by holding what I have. I hope the trend continues upward."

2021-05-27 10:33:10,wallstreetbets,Revenue is revenue
2021-05-27 11:08:38,wallstreetbets,So I should be pretty happy I just got in at around 9.5

2021-05-26 20:58:12,wallstreetbets,💩
2021-05-27 11:37:20,wallstreetbets,By your logic a company with $11bn revenue should not be $388bn.  Ever heard of NVDA?  Or a closer analogy $2.5bn revenue and $92bn market cap.  SNAP.
2021-05-27 11:45:53,wallstreetbets,Just Joined you. One of the more ridiculous 4 hour charts I have ever seen.
2021-05-27 14:04:37,wallstreetbets,Get REKT
2021-05-27 17:26:41,wallstreetbets,I don’t get why everyone is shorting this company lol. There are way more outrageous valuations out there
2021-05-27 10:07:48,wallstreetbets,That’s subjective. I’ve played fort nite and I’ve played on Roblox and I can tell you that I’ve spent more time on Roblox overall. Fortnite was a nightmare bc of the player base alone
2021-05-27 08:40:49,wallstreetbets,I wish more parents existed with your common sense.
2021-05-27 12:58:45,wallstreetbets,"Looks like my shares may get called after all at $95 tomorrow. If it breaks the $100 mark, I bet it hits $120 before it drops back below $100..."
2021-05-27 13:33:02,wallstreetbets,Are we still valuing companies based on current numbers still. We know the market doesn’t work like that right now. Its all about future potential and hype right now.
2021-05-27 18:28:53,wallstreetbets,This is the reason these shorts are getting fucked. They think roballs is a fad yearly franchise crack addict when it's maintained by its community for the most part. Long term it might eventually dwindle but it has no real competitors for at least a few years since you can run the game on a total potato.
2021-05-27 16:03:02,wallstreetbets,I was rooting for you today. Almost fuckin there boii
2021-05-26 22:14:32,wallstreetbets,Then why has Ford said that the F-150 and Mach-E are margin positive? Are they lying?
2021-05-26 21:55:02,wallstreetbets,The only one that is close to production is the Liriq. The Silverado and the Escalade are 2-4 years away. The Liriq will likely sell but it’s not mass-market. That 60k base price will translate to 75k+ average sale price. Cadillac doesn’t have a good track record competing against the Germans playing in that price range.
2021-05-26 22:25:46,wallstreetbets,"They do have positive margin… contribution margin positive, not gross margin or overall positive. Parse Ford’s CEO’s comments on this carefully.

It is very hard for them to be profitable overall with these vehicles at such low volume. The most expensive parts of an electric vehicle are parts that are not shared with their ICE vehicles,
so their ICE vehicle scale doesn’t apply. Sure, their seats, their window switches, their windshields will have massive scale. But not their battery packs, drive motors, inverters, BMS, or even the HVAC thermal management."
2021-05-27 18:23:26,wallstreetbets,Silverado is 2023 vs 2022. There are pitfalls to being first...

2021-05-27 16:25:24,wallstreetbets,I agree I bought 200 Canadian in dec cause I believed in the company then later went parabolic sold at 28  100 then  at 32 50 shares kept 50 back just in case added back 150 at 9.75 recently will keep accummulating in the 9-10 range see what happens tomorrow with the short squeeze today propped the shares up a bit in BB as well im in it for the long term unless there is a parabolic move may sell off half and buy back on any good dips its a good long term hold
2021-05-27 17:20:21,wallstreetbets,Is that \~14.51 on NYSE or TSE?

2021-05-27 15:31:16,wallstreetbets,"From my understanding it isn't really competing with YouTube as it is providing software as a service for a subscription fee and also from my understanding their software is far superior than really anything out there. So video creation tools are also a huge plus that they're offering. They wouldn't care if you made your video through then and then uploaded it to YouTube, they still get their subscription fee."
2021-05-27 15:26:20,wallstreetbets,"From what I've been reading I'm seeing $70B/year market by 2024. If true and if they can get a sizable chunk of that market share (which they are sort of first on the scene or close-to) it could mean some high growth potential.

I'll see if I can the sources I read for that."
2021-05-27 16:04:36,wallstreetbets,If that's the case then the entire bit about Youtube is completely irrelevant. So where are they getting the customers and how is the stock going to moon?
2021-05-27 19:13:13,wallstreetbets,I hope you held. Must be doing good now.
2021-05-27 01:29:27,wallstreetbets,need more commas first
2021-05-26 21:34:09,wallstreetbets,As soon as Fidelity and Schwab let me!
2021-05-26 21:34:52,wallstreetbets,Schwab emailed me for mine a couple of weeks ago!
2021-05-27 08:23:16,wallstreetbets,"With the initial costs like setting up our factory, finding the right staff, paying the right salaries for skilled welders and government certifications (we can build all across the world now without on site inspections), it can be a pretty penny. But once you're going, I would say it's about 2/3 the price of traditional construction if you know what you're doing and can meet demand properly. I also find that most clients want customization so very few have wanted set models unless we're dealing with for example a trailer park or resort developer. With customization comes extra costs and lots of upgrading on the client side. You're limited to specific ceiling heights and modules because the labour it takes to say cut out an an entire side is very expensive and time consuming. We're still learning as we go along. Thankfully we have a primary business that's related so we have resources to fall back on. It's probably way cheaper in place with less regulations like the US. But we don't want to build units that can potentially kill someone in the long-term or grow mold cuz it's not ventilated properly etc. I see so many DIYers and it's great until your window starts sagging because you haven't correctly engineered it for the weight and property of the steel. We definitely have moved onto steel framed modular houses. You can build whatever you want and have cathedral ceilings. Still have limitations due to shipping logistics and costs (width of modules. Many container companies just build new containers in China and ship them over. They're not real shipping containers but look like them."
2021-05-27 18:08:28,wallstreetbets,Looks like it’s explosive!!!!

Under the UN international treaties, there is no lawful international commerce in rec cannabis, only medical, where allowed.  
When the time comes that international commerce in rec weed is allowed, countries will have to decide if it's agricultural, horticultural, or it's own trade category, or fight protectionism cases in the courts.."

2021-05-26 23:29:17,wallstreetbets,I own stock in ASO but I'm very new to options. When I was looking in my broker's tools to was showing that owning stock has played out better than options for this company. The stock is very new so maybe that's why. Could you help me understand why options would be better than just owning the stock in this case? Thank you!

2021-05-27 17:21:21,wallstreetbets,China and the U.S. just had their trade reps meet and it sounds like things went well. Alibaba also has some big shopping event coming up on 6/18 which is apparently the 2nd largest shopping event of the year in China behind singles day. Lot of catalysts.

2021-05-27 12:34:59,wallstreetbets,"The process of getting chlorine is extremely expensive, that's why OLN is dropping their poor diaphragm grade chlorine in favour of the newer technology to extract chlorine from hypochlorites better.

In terms of ""cheap"" you can visit FED louis to see the price history of chlorine. The 1 year trend is looking very attractive and comparable to 2018 prices"
2021-05-26 23:27:24,wallstreetbets,Stay on the safe side and go short on ZN 10 year futures. You get 100 fold leverage - it’s a no brainer - inflation will come back in Avery ugly way.

2021-05-26 22:28:53,wallstreetbets,"You could sell now and then waste it, or hold and years or decades from now today's price will seem like peanuts. Flipping houses is great if that's what you do on the side, but if it's your only property, unless you downsize you'll likely lose money on rent or an even more expensive home."
2021-05-26 23:18:31,wallstreetbets,"We are not selling this house any time soon, my wife loves it.  Really we would just rent it out some day and have a place out of town when we are not so tied to this area.  We had a five year plan like all our other homes but it's too good of an area for us to see us moving.  We always roll the money from one home to the next."

2021-05-27 12:32:32,wallstreetbets,"If anyone believes there is going to be any sort of economic downfall ahead in the middle or lower class, the dollar general earnings seem most interesting to me. It’s still a far ways off from its 52 week high, and if you look at its performance out of the 2008 recession, they actually benefitted as they are the Target of dollar stores, and the middle class was comfortable going to them and shopping when money got tight. Does anyone else see them as a solid long play to hedge against any bust in the economy in the next 3 years or am I looking at this all wrong"

2021-05-26 23:12:11,wallstreetbets,"So forgive my ignorance being that I'm new to this game (new to being hands-on, not new to being invested) but what is a ""good one"" if earnings are weaker than expected?"

2021-05-27 08:54:17,wallstreetbets,"Hiring freezes during acquisitions are common and gaps in the company's workforce are often filled with contractors and temps during the freeze.

The acquisition process can get SUPER messy VERY quickly so a hiring freeze helps avoid that while a new post-acquisition workforce structure and money flow are finalized.

Trying to call it a red flag is like pointing at the ""add eggs"" step of a cake recipe and screaming about salmonella."
2021-05-26 23:47:21,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I’m a bit of a degen, so I don’t put much DD into it. But by “good one” he means a stock that you believe in. One that you think was unfairly brought down from earnings and will go back up.

I chose Ford because I believe their Ford Lightning will provide enough competition to the EV game that it’ll prop up the stock. In addition to this, I noticed that after every earnings it would drop a few dollars and then slowly reach pre-earnings price after about a month or so.

Obviously this won’t always work, but that’s how I play it at least lol"

2021-05-27 16:31:18,wallstreetbets,ATM fees are good. But if I were Cracker Barrel I’d start offering store credit cards with 30% APR ASAP.
2021-05-27 16:11:49,wallstreetbets,And these people - the “poories” - do they pay with debit cards or cash only? Perhaps strategically located ATMs with exorbitant fees would be profitable at such locations.
