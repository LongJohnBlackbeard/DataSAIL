2021-07-01 19:25:34,wallstreetbets,So NG is fine but RNG is complete cowshit?
2021-07-01 19:30:50,wallstreetbets,"Since you work in the industry and you know which companies pump their RNG into your pipelines can you enlighten us as to which companies RNG you guys pumped into your pipes?  Was one of the companies CLNE?

As well all know their are several refineries that produce gasoline.  This is no different for RNG, that being said different companies use different processes to refine their products.  Is it possible you guys used a lesser company with a bad processing batch?"
2021-07-01 19:42:05,wallstreetbets,Where was this DD two weeks ago when everyone was pumping the fuck out of it lol
2021-07-01 19:25:38,wallstreetbets,"No position in CLNE here.

I wonder RNG will be like ethanol. Yes, it‚Äôs not as good as refined petroleum gasoline. It‚Äôs less efficient and destroys parts of older fuel systems that weren‚Äôt designed to use ethanol, etc. I don‚Äôt know if ethanol is cheaper to produce than gasoline. 

And yet here we are. Ethanol mixes are mandated everywhere and we all live with it, because despite the problems there are benefits too."
2021-07-01 19:24:00,wallstreetbets,So you work for some dog shit company in some shitty state. That's not CLNE.

2021-07-01 19:29:21,wallstreetbets,Here in the UK we just got Ethanol mixed fuel mandated into our regular fuels. I now have to replace a bunch of shit on my classic mini to make it survive the change. Fuck ethanol but Brrrrrr CLNE üêÑüí®

2021-07-01 19:45:16,wallstreetbets,That is 50% upside. Not bad
2021-07-01 19:44:48,wallstreetbets,Compared to the other ticker-specific subs which are completely rational? As a rule of thumb it's wise to avoid all of them. I'm not sure that's a valid reason to cancel all potential
2021-07-01 19:53:04,wallstreetbets,Calls on his life. Sounds like ATH to me
2021-07-01 19:48:31,wallstreetbets,The people in the microvision sub for example actually discussed the company and its products and research. CLNE is just cows and rockets and stock price. I just like to get a feeling for the people who hold the same stock and it just didn't fit.

2021-07-01 19:30:22,wallstreetbets,"Fuck.  I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

I have calls on SPCE, but I'm not going to have access the internet on July 11 to sell when the stock price hits the moon (or when the thing explodes during livestream).

No doubt it will be at earth levels again by the 12th.  :(

So perhaps I should just sell tomorrow for a half-decent profit and let someone else have the ridiculous profits.

Edit: OK, so the 11th is a Sunday.  I will get to enjoy the trading on the 12th!"

2021-07-01 17:15:28,wallstreetbets,"eGaming is in a pickle in China. 

1. There were rumors in China that the deal was off because the govt made demands that would've made the deal unprofitable. 
2. eGaming future isn't as hot as it was. Less profit, more competition, increased govt scrutiny and regulation, etc.

I was all for the merger 2 months ago. I wouldn't touch it until DOYU goes down to $3."
2021-07-01 17:23:26,wallstreetbets,That would explain the difference in pricing of why it‚Äôs not trading at .73 anymore. What about the gap difference in Chinese sector rotation recently? Huya and Doyu are both eGaming. #1 and #2 respectively
2021-07-01 19:14:41,wallstreetbets,"agreed, I was an early investor of Huyu when it first IPO-ed, and was on wsb when they were a lot of chatter about it. It spiked and crashed pretty quickly and now it's only a bit above list price. 

I wouldn't touch it because of increased government scrutiny and since they are mostly owned by Tencent there may be some ripple affect on them."

So how is a person supposed to responsibly invest for their‚Äôs and their family‚Äôs future when the entire market (and economy) hinges entirely on what the Fed decides to do?

I don't even really know what ""value"" means anymore since everything is overbought...what value plays even exist right now?

Gold/silver/precious metals...I know nothing about that shit. Half the time people make it sound like they're a scam sold to elderly cable news viewers or at least are over-hyped in their inflationary protective powers.

Assets...uhmm...housing market is insane right now. Plus not everyone wants to be a landlord. REITs get chewed up by higher rates. 

Commodities and DOW and hope infrastructure spending moons them and that it's not all priced in already?

2021-07-01 17:25:36,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-07-01 19:38:58,wallstreetbets,"That is the TRILLION dollar question! It all depends on how much the fed is willing to print. At some point they are going to have to choose between saving the dollar (and raising rates but also crashing the economy - housing, stock market, bond market, and US debt spiral) or printing enough to keep long term rates low which means a LOT of inflation. 

We all know what politicians do. They take the easy way. So my guess is they keep printing. It‚Äôs a vicious tax on low and middle income earners. So the dems can talk all they want about taxing the rich. But when inflation crushes the lower and middle class and they take 50% from the rich who made 300% in appreciation‚Ä¶ who is really getting the short end?"
2021-07-01 19:47:06,wallstreetbets,Wouldn‚Äôt they want to wait until AFTER though? This actually makes the timing of the draw down more suspicious. In the lead up to the suspension you would think they would want a big cash pile and would thus be issuing more debt. I think this further supports the theory that they did it to keep a lid on long term rates. Which is essential to keeping inflation expectations in check. This move basically quadrupled the impact of the current QE program!

2021-07-01 19:58:50,wallstreetbets,The current narrative being pushed is that gold and silver are a boomer play that is no longer seen as much of a store of wealth. Is this incorrect?

I expect them to raise or suspend the ceiling again soon and kick the can further down the road."
2021-07-01 18:18:57,wallstreetbets,"Really interesting post, still absorbing the main thesis but I agree with many of your points at first glance.

Playing devil's advocate here on the inflation comment.  Inflation can come in different forms; I would think inflation driven by an imbalance in supply/demand (housing market is the main culprit here) would likely increase the wealth gap, but inflation driven by expansionary monetary policy paired with a progressive tax structure could help close it in theory (e.g. universal basic income heavily favoring the lowest tax brackets).

Return on capital has a huge impact on wealth gap, Piketty's *Capital in the Twenty-First Century* has been on my reading list for far too long, but the thesis of the book is that the wealth gap increases if rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of economic growth.  Basically, the wealthy have a massive head start and high return on capital allows them to soak up an outsized portion of aggregate growth.  Food for thought!"
2021-07-01 17:16:23,wallstreetbets,It does and it doesn‚Äôt. The crony capitalism of trickle down economy doesn‚Äôt help the poor
2021-07-01 19:44:37,wallstreetbets,"We have had massive inflation in the past decade and it has manifested itself in asset prices (houses, stock market, etc). So by advocating for MMT you are basically asking for another government intervention to try and solve a government intervention (not to mention it vastly distorts the allocation of capital). When the government intervened the least is when the wealth gap shrunk the most (and gave birth to the wealthiest country the world has ever seen)!"
2021-07-01 17:20:26,wallstreetbets,agreed. but what really hurts someone on a fixed income is inflation

2021-07-01 18:41:31,wallstreetbets,"Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again."

2021-07-01 19:53:07,wallstreetbets,"This depends on two things:

First- You're entirely right and the spread on ITM calls sucks an entire bag of dicks. Right now it looks like we're burning 40 cents a share for 1 strike in- well within the territory where it makes more sense to just exercise and sell. The nice part about VICI is that it's NOT AMC so I wont loose my ass while I exercise the options.

Second- the timing of the Venetian deal. if VICI didn't start realizing their profits by Jan and the price doesn't reflect the new income stream then I'll probably exercise and ride it up for those sweet divvies."

2021-07-01 15:11:30,wallstreetbets,When you buy Gamestop on Robinhood you are robbing yourself from earning money. The cash and information you give them can be used against you. If you are margin GL
2021-07-01 18:41:24,wallstreetbets,Robinhood? For real?

2021-07-01 16:23:02,wallstreetbets,"those 7/2 $212.5c aren't bad lottery tickets. 

i can't tell if we're about to explode or have another month of waiting around in this sideways game"
2021-07-01 16:40:15,wallstreetbets,"$1300? Your imagination seems too limited. That's like dreaming you can float but not fly. Unleash your mind, fellow ape!"
2021-07-01 17:10:49,wallstreetbets,Dude. Get off robinhood
2021-07-01 19:09:23,wallstreetbets,Careful I had a dream CRSR hit 56$ after their little pop a few weeks ago so I held my 40$ calls from 9 cents to 6$ to 0$ lmaoooo

2021-07-01 17:14:31,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs at 205. Good time to buy. I was gonna wait til 12th july when I get my next pay but I just can‚Äôt risk waiting until then. Then I saw it‚Äôs at 205 a share and deposited ¬£200 into my account to buy some more GME when the market opens. That should take me to about 2 and a half shares as I put ¬£200 in last week.
2021-07-01 18:02:27,wallstreetbets,I need to start giving handies to support my options addiction

And then I tell her about the thousands of people on these subs who would tell you to buy. Then she says how all of them must be in on the con and then I called her thick and had to leave the roomüòÇ that didn‚Äôt go well."
2021-07-01 18:19:43,wallstreetbets,Assuming you meant $1300M

The vast majority of screenshots posted here are from Robinhood.

I ditched Robinhood back in February, but when they IPO and all you clowns are loading up on puts, I'm buying calls because of retards like OP."

2021-07-01 19:33:29,wallstreetbets,All brokers are like that.
2021-07-01 19:28:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah... honestly I don't understand how this happens. How does a person not know about, or know about the scandals and still choose to use Robinhood?"
2021-07-01 17:17:39,wallstreetbets,What did it say?
2021-07-01 19:32:13,wallstreetbets,I had a dream Robinhood prevented him from selling anywhere above 500 lmao
2021-07-01 17:37:28,wallstreetbets,i don't know why people think this will hit higher than 1300 if it can even hit that price

If it happens, you shouldn't be surprised to see 5 or even 6 digits per share. Or we'll just be in this limbo for the next 5 years. 

Personally I'm too pessimistic to even dream of 1m or 30m per share, but I'm holding some of my shares forever in case it does happen."

This time next year they'll still be saying this even once it goes down to its fair value."

2021-07-01 19:06:43,wallstreetbets,at the rate this is going Ryan Cohen would raise company fair value to 200 dollars per share.
2021-07-01 19:34:59,wallstreetbets,"There's a lot of due diligence showing they never covered and I've seen almost no evidence that they did cover. Also the Robinhood lawsuit showed there was 226% short interest in January, 140% is just the max they can report.....so you do you boo boo üëå

2021-07-01 16:45:11,wallstreetbets,If you have 500 shares you could make some bank selling covered calls. Even if you only didn‚Äôt want to risk having them all assigned you could do it with 200 shares and could collect some nice premiums and then buy more BB :)

2021-07-01 13:59:04,wallstreetbets,Soooo what I'm hearing is at least 35% of their float will be shorted?
2021-07-01 14:52:18,wallstreetbets,I hope it tanks
2021-07-01 15:01:54,wallstreetbets,"So lemme get this straight,  we can hold shares of the money they fuck people out of?"
2021-07-01 14:46:03,wallstreetbets,"And then Citadel will squeeze the retail shorts and take back some of the money retail made on the squeezes earlier this year.


Better to just ignore Robinhood stock entirely."
2021-07-01 14:04:09,wallstreetbets,"If you're still on Robbin'hood, you didn't learn a thing back in January. Sure, this little reach-around may be nice, but they're still pounding you up the ass.  Don't forget, they accepted a billion in bailout cash from Citadel. They are not on your side."
2021-07-01 13:55:35,wallstreetbets,Well then let‚Äôs show them why that‚Äôs such a fucking bad idea
2021-07-01 14:41:11,wallstreetbets,And the other 35% for Bulgaria
2021-07-01 16:20:35,wallstreetbets,They can keep them.

2021-07-01 16:08:43,wallstreetbets,Snap! I‚Äôm setting aside 35% liquidity for puts
2021-07-01 18:19:49,wallstreetbets,how soon after an IPO can you short the stock? I tried to do one today and def want to short Robinhood

2021-07-01 15:07:31,wallstreetbets,Options won't be available when it just comes out right? So it can't be shorted yet? Someone please correct me and help me understand.

2021-07-01 14:07:01,wallstreetbets,? I think you misinterpret the point of this post. I‚Äôm saying that essentially they will be shorted 35% as they fucked retail investors so hard consistently.
2021-07-01 14:59:32,wallstreetbets,Naturally
2021-07-01 14:05:24,wallstreetbets,The ticker is $HOOD from what I‚Äôve seen.

2021-07-01 14:17:09,wallstreetbets,"I don't think I'm misinterpreting anything. I'm actually in agreement. Robbin'hood is peddling this as a ""perk"" for retail, when we know damn well who owns their real allegiance."

2021-07-01 16:59:50,wallstreetbets,I'm assuming you bought these when the price was sub 80? Grats man
2021-07-01 13:51:04,wallstreetbets,Mandem gonna be rich rich
2021-07-01 14:28:10,wallstreetbets,"Thought about closing my 90c and roll it all into leaps.
Do you think it will go up until earnings?  
Might be worth keeping mine then."
2021-07-01 14:08:00,wallstreetbets,Well played
2021-07-01 14:44:35,wallstreetbets,"I don't know if that was a good idea. I hope it is because ive been balls deep in shares all year but performance has been really lackluster and its constantly pulling back every time it seems to get some momentum. 

&#x200B;

Neverminded that was a TERIIBLE idea. There's no way we are hitting the $99.45 you need for this in time."
2021-07-01 13:47:09,wallstreetbets,I bought the 7/16 90 C about 2 weeks ago.
2021-07-01 14:47:32,wallstreetbets,"i hope so. I think it will go up and 8/20 will give me exposure to earnings as well which should be good hopefully. I sold yesterday because I felt that looking at the options for this week there are too many 94/95C so it would pull back a bit. Seems like I was right, but now its almost made a full recovery haha so who knows. Eitherway, i had to close the position with such gains so I just bought 8/20 with the profits. If everything goes south, I still have shares so I can hold those for longer."
2021-07-01 14:56:52,wallstreetbets,"I guess we will have to wait and see. Option flows says another story and its not like I cant close this position earlier as well, maybe before earnings release if there is a good build up prior to it. Either way, if it ends up going horribly its from my profits so its not the end of the world as well."
2021-07-01 19:03:44,wallstreetbets,What do you use for options flows?
2021-07-01 19:09:20,wallstreetbets,I use blackbox.

3. Display progress on international expansion for all three platforms (BODi, Myxfitness and MyOpenFit

2021-07-01 16:20:57,wallstreetbets,Existing BOD subscribers will have the option to pay an additional $19.95 a month to join their BODi platform. BODi is their new platform where trainers can engage directly with their clients to help correct their form and motivate them. New and live content will be streamed everyday which is why the increase in price is justified. Their current BOD subscription allows consumers to cycle through their world leading inventory of workout videos but BODi will be a game changer in the fitness world.
2021-07-01 16:33:34,wallstreetbets,"How is that not easily attainable? MYXfitness has been growing organically at close to 12,000 bikes a quarter. Now that they‚Äôve merged with BB, they can use their $400M in cash to market to consumers as well as their own 2.7M subscribers. You‚Äôre saying they can‚Äôt transition 3% of their existing subscribers over to MYXfitness this year?"

2021-07-01 13:36:35,wallstreetbets,"I own both stocks same amount of shares. 

I beleive NIO has a better service, cars look better, bat swype station, etc... 

Xpeng has/will have better/bigger production capacity, better technology (parking and self driving), flying cars, and cheaper vehicles... 

I like both companies, and both will have a bright future almost for sure. However, at current prices, Xpeng look a better deal.

Since day one I started investing in both companies I never understood why there so many people arguing about both companies, its like Ford VS GM... Who cares?!? It's two different companies people don't need to be arguing or have to choose only one.

I beleive in both, and I beleive Chinese car market is going to grow a lot more, because of that I also own UXIN to take advantage of the growing Chinese used car market."

And replacing the battery is still going to be quicker than charging it, they can do a swap in a few minutes which is comparable with filling up with petrol."
2021-07-01 13:56:26,wallstreetbets,"I live in the UK and saw an Xpeng vehicle last year, they're quite striking in person. I only recognised it from the badge. I've never seen an NIO vehicle over here."
2021-07-01 14:02:05,wallstreetbets,Xpeng does have BaaS or Battery swap. Two things that make nio superior.

2021-07-01 13:13:35,wallstreetbets,"I left Atlanta and headed to the hills. No quite retired yet at 42, but will easily hit it by 50. No reason to stay in a city. Made a ton of money on the house in bought in 2009, bought smaller in the mountains for cash. Work remote in IT but dont need that much anymore either. I can tell you that the amount of paperwork i've had present with a top tier credit score and a million dollar network was ridiculous to the last time i bought in 2009."
2021-07-01 13:14:45,wallstreetbets,"Been in the real estate industry 30+ years. Never in my life seen anything like this‚Ä¶ The bubble in 2007 / 2008 is nothing like what‚Äôs going on now. Back then everything was a risk, gamble, Speculation loans no income no job verification etc. The wild wild west‚Ä¶

Buyers now are coming from the larger cities paying cash or putting 50% down. Prices are climbing exponentially month over month but with so much cash in place even if the market does soften I don‚Äôt see a ‚Äúcrash‚Äù happening anytime soon.

The unknown factor at this time is what happens when the government stops the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures? 

Will be interesting to see‚Ä¶"
2021-07-01 12:59:30,wallstreetbets,"*Everyone is saying housing bubble*

Seems like 99% of the people saying this can't afford a home and are gaslighting themselves into optimism"
2021-07-01 13:01:38,wallstreetbets,"Nope. Plus there are guard rails in place now to prevent what previously happened. For example, you can‚Äôt get a NINJA loan anymore."
2021-07-01 13:04:01,wallstreetbets,"I don't think there's a housing bubble, it's just artificial demand and supply due to low interest rates and eviction stops. People are also moving further away to work from home since major cities are unaffordable. People are also diversifying their major gains from March 2020."
2021-07-01 15:15:15,wallstreetbets,"The thing people often forget about the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums is that foreclosures take like 2-3 *years* in the courts normally, depending on the municipality. 

So, there was/is a moratorium on new foreclosures b.c. covid, but also existing foreclosures from *before* covid were halted as well for two reasons - (1) the moratorium itself and (2) most courts, like the government itself, were operating under reduced capacity and a maximum telework environment. Which meant that old foreclosures simply weren't being processed at any appreciable rate during the pandemic - simply wasn't a priority of the limited court capacity during lockdown.

Now, after a year and a half since the start of lockdown you have a situation where you're going to have 4.5 years of foreclosures hitting the court system/market at the same time.

Add the eviction moratorium to that - you have, across the country, millions of landlords whose tenants haven't paid rent in a good long while. The smaller mom and pop landlords are behind on their mortgages. Maybe they'll get foreclosed, maybe they won't - but tenants will def be getting evicted.

Now look at 2008 - who *actually* evicted and foreclosed properties? Police, the local sheriff, law enforcement generally. The federal government is currently using emergency covid funds to help states beef up police recruitment. Someone's gonna have to evict all those people, and the president's talking up crime.

Finally, you have the remote work transition - as others have pointed out, many buyers from cities have been buying up (relativley) cheaper properties in the country, perhaps near scenic locales. Well what happens when (1) companies like Google start pulling back on the remote work [already happening] and (2) tech companies realize that they don't need to pay locality adjusted bay area salaries to employees living in rural Montana?

These factors paint a dim picture of the prospects for the housing market within the next 2-3 years. The only silver lining here, and what many people are banking on, is that *maybe* inflation will balance out or surpass the downward pressure from the above factors on valuations relative to other assets. The trouble here, and what the fed is deathly afraid of, is a Japanese style macroeconomic situation (as opposed to inflation) following the pop of a multi-sector asset bubble affecting asset valuations across the board. This also explains recent monetary policy.

I don't know what the future holds - but I can tell you this: I wouldn't buy a house rn and I feel bad for anyone that did during covid. Talked my folks out of buying a 3rd house for the above reasons."
2021-07-01 13:27:04,wallstreetbets,If blackrock and other funds are going around paying cash over asking price I think the housing market is safe for a bit.
2021-07-01 13:09:17,wallstreetbets,There are still subprime lenders out there but I imagine a majority of banks are still monitoring their own internal pipelines. Some lenders have their own overlays that are tighter than Fannie/Freddie. This is different than last time. I worry more about an auto bubble.
2021-07-01 13:34:09,wallstreetbets,"America as a whole, and specifically desireable areas (CA, WA, OR, ID, TX) are wayy behind on keeing up with building new homes- talking millions. Bay Area, CA has to build over 250K new homes in the next 8 years just to even out supply vs demand. Some reports suggest the number needs to be closer to 400K. 

Millennials and boomers are the biggest generations like ever (Gen Z might be bigger but not buying houses yet, at least not in CA). Boomers are living longer than anticipated, millennials are ready to buy now. Too  many new buyers in the last 10 years when new construction has been all but halted. Not to mention thousands and thousands of homes have been destroyed by wildfires and rebuilds are like 2% over the last 5 years. It is not a bubble."
2021-07-01 18:03:25,wallstreetbets,"- There are not as many subprime mortgages this time around, obviously and clearly.

- Housing crashes can be initiated by things outside of risky loans / foreclosures.

- The prices that folks are seeing in local markets are built on geographic dispersion of wealthier locations to other localities. These markets are unlikely to ""crash"", but prices are likely to stabilize / drops once movers have made their moves. Probably 18 months.

- Surging prices in already unaffordable / affluent neighborhoods is a result of institutional investment / foreign investment; cash offers are abundant due to available credit. It depends on how long these individuals / organizations are willing to hold, and whether near-term paper losses will shake them off. These are likely to drop back down around the same timeframe, as buyers get locked up into alternative arrangements, geographies, etc.

Crash, no. But the premiums we're seeing are not going to last."
2021-07-01 19:04:22,wallstreetbets,There is a subprime lending bubble but it's in unsecured debt and auto loans. There is no mortgage bubble.
2021-07-01 19:05:45,wallstreetbets,And inflation is the Boogeyman
2021-07-01 15:16:06,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm a licensed LO and can confirm that the housing market is getting a little crazy, but people have always been retarded with their money and I think this sub is a pinnacle to that. Should you be buying a house right? Maybe! Depends where you live."

2021-07-01 17:15:22,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not.

Inflation leads to people putting $ into Real Assets.

My home has appreciated 30% in one year and I could put it on the market today and sell it tomorrow. 

People are just moving their money somewhere safe. Demand is still above supply also driving prices up. Low interest rates makes buying homes attractive.

Prices are just catching up to the opportunities we have with rates/inflation. 

We have a few more years until it goes down unless a big  unforeseen event happens."
2021-07-01 17:34:18,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt believe we are in a bubble but I do believe prices are extended above normal and will pull back 5-20% in the near future.

There is no supply. Because Labor shortage and costs Sky rocketing on materials. So New Home Builders are not pumping out homes.

Influx in demand because of mentioned reasons.

Eviction/foreclosure moratoriums

Many of these will resolve themselves into the fall. Supply and Demand will normalize.

No bubble just market forces and if you are buying for long run 10+ years. Nothing wrong with buying.

If your buying to invest, fix n flip, or even just make it a rental I feel you will be able to get better pricing soon."
2021-07-01 18:42:34,wallstreetbets,"If a 2008 crash is coming, it won‚Äôt be because of current residential house prices or loose loan underwriting.  Prices are fucking stupid right now - but by all accounts - the people signing up for these mortgages are lightspeed more qualified than what caused the last crash.  

I think there are a variety of factors which WILL cause a correction (qe taper / rate hikes primarily), and maybe slide farther into crash territory - withh the only q being ‚Äòwhen‚Äô - but I don‚Äôt think the residential home market or related CDO‚Äôs will be the initial / root cause.  What happens after the mortage / eviction moratorium goes away is anyone‚Äôs guess - but the prices themselves of what houses are going for right now aren‚Äôt going to do anything but maybe make short term bagholders once the market corrects and shit calms down.

I think we probably have far more to be concerned about commercial real estate, and their mortgage backed securities.  But who knows right?  I‚Äôm just a retard in a sub comprised entirely of retards."
2021-07-01 13:18:42,wallstreetbets,If there‚Äôs really any risk it‚Äôs going to be asset depreciation once interest rates rise. Harder to borrow at higher rates so I think all those people who bought now are going to see a pretty big deprecation in a couple years.
2021-07-01 18:13:45,wallstreetbets,"To me it‚Äôs tough. Homes are extremely overvalued at the moment. I bought my home 5 years ago and it‚Äôs now worth $100K more. Thats nuts! When interest rates normalize and prices drop, many will be underwater and many will have challenges selling. It‚Äôs not the best recipe"
2021-07-01 19:56:47,wallstreetbets,I'd be more concerned with Commercial property than residential at this point.
2021-07-01 12:59:17,wallstreetbets,You lost?
2021-07-01 13:52:21,wallstreetbets,"We'll see.  I think there is a bubble but not close to the point of 2008.  Everything is crazy overvalued right now (homes, cars, stocks) and many people are on a consume-type thinking due to FOMO and low interest rates.  Everyone's riding high right now but there will be some sort of smallish correction down the road."
2021-07-01 14:32:57,wallstreetbets,"The last bubble was subprime foreclosures. This one will be FHA foreclosures.

Too many ""good"" credit people putting nothing down and more than half their pay going to a mortgage.

That starts to hurt after about 40 payments. Add in there a recession. BAM mass foreclosures."
2021-07-01 13:37:53,wallstreetbets,When the housing market goes up nearly 100% in 2 years it be a bubble. I know history don't repeat. üòÅüòÅ
2021-07-01 16:02:08,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not a sub-prime mortgage bubble like the last one. The market is still reeling from COVID economics and materials to build homes are still scarce and extremely expensive. 

Those prices will come back to earth at some point, housing starts will pick up even more adding to supply, and interest rates WILL go up. That won‚Äôt be a good combo for real estate investments. 

No disrespect, but you are absolutely out of your mind if you think overpaying by 50% at today‚Äôs prices would look like a good deal in 10 years for almost anyone. You don‚Äôt know what this market will do in a decade. It‚Äôs just highly unlikely to play out that way. 

And when, how, and where people will be retiring? You are assuming a whole lot on this post, OP‚Ä¶ Whatever you do I hope it works out for you, and I don‚Äôt know how long you‚Äôve been doing this, but this isn‚Äôt something I would be so certain of if I were you‚Ä¶

2021-07-01 14:59:02,wallstreetbets,"Buying a house has gotten increasingly difficult, the one I live in now I just made a phone call, signed papers 2 weeks later, I did drop 20 percent down even then. 

I later bought a house for a starter house for my kids, it was tons of paperwork, the dam thing looked like a book, I don‚Äôt see a housing bubble, but from what I‚Äôve read that there is a commercial property bubble coming, because of the baked in betting on derivatives and loses.

2021-07-01 14:39:17,wallstreetbets,The mortgage I received is most definitely sub-prime lmao
2021-07-01 17:50:40,wallstreetbets,It's not going to tank until interest rates rise enough that the current home prices are unaffordable on a monthly basis. Maybe 2023?
2021-07-01 13:28:32,wallstreetbets,I went through hell refinancing a few months back with an 820 credit score. They almost cancelled my application because I forgot to disclose an acre of land I own in the mountains that I havent been to in 2 years. So I guess thats a good sign?
2021-07-01 16:17:44,wallstreetbets,"But the thing is, no one ever sees a crash coming. I was 19 when the bubble burst and I remember very well a family conversation that included an aunt who was upper management for Federal Home Loan Bank. In short, even *she and other bank management* thought it was impossible that they were in a bubble and they explained exactly why it ""wasn't possible"" and that everything was just dandy! 

6 months or so later they were humbled. Is this a subprime bubble right now? No, but there is something going on and you cannot deny that the trajectory of prices is absolutely unsustainable. You're right, it will be interesting.

I am glad you're making money though! Get it while you can, man!"
2021-07-01 13:44:25,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the gem of insight, this is why I come here! I too was wondering about how this will all play out with how many people are putting down big chunks of cash meanwhile, and even though its on the rise, cash out refinance as a percentage of equity is still well below 2008ish peak levels, so it might be a good indicator that people buying are not strapped for cash or looking to buy investment homes with a cashout"
2021-07-01 19:53:23,wallstreetbets,"I also think there were a lot of millenials stuck in the rent trap for a decade after 2008 that are now buying. 

Where I live $350k house with low down payment is coming in around $2,000 a month with the fixed rates. The low rates are allowing the price to rise, along with other things. 

And if you sell in 10 years and values are down, that just means you'll be buying another house for cheaper as well. It all works out in the long run, but we may see some people under water in between now and then if they drop suddenly."
2021-07-01 13:31:48,wallstreetbets,"Broker-adjacent here, totally agree.  Pre-2008 loans were ‚Äúall‚Äù subprime.  Tons of no-doc ARM loans."
2021-07-01 17:52:28,wallstreetbets,The biggest difference between now and and 2008 is home buyers today have a lot more skin in the game and are generally better qualified. I agree a crash is unlikely but a correction will come when interest rates rise without a doubt. The current price trajectory is not sustainable.
2021-07-01 15:02:22,wallstreetbets,Foreclosures?  Who's underwater in this bubble?

2021-07-01 17:26:02,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs also people who can WFH some of the time switching to homes that give them more space for home offices, and people who no longer feel comfortable in buildings that share a lot of space.

2021-07-01 17:13:29,wallstreetbets,What happens if people turn their 30 year mortgages into 40 year mortgages and all the foreclosure/eviction stuff never happens. Obviously this is relying on 40 year mortgages to actually be a thing.

Was probably a different story 12 years ago."
2021-07-01 16:25:53,wallstreetbets,"Yea this is a great point, and to tie in what another said above, when the rates rise, and Home values decline if you plan to be there 10+ years, it shouldn‚Äôt matter.

2021-07-01 13:52:05,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts too.  No mortgage bubble, just overpriced houses due to demand side having extra cash flow right now.

2021-07-01 15:50:20,wallstreetbets,"According to whitehouse.org

‚ÄúThe COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a housing affordability crisis. Today, 1 in 5 renters is behind on rent and just over 10 million homeowners are behind on  mortgage payments.‚Äù

A good portion of Those 10 million homeowners will never be able to get current on their payments. Business lost, jobs not coming back etc. most of our country live Paycheck to paycheck with micro savings / investments. 

There could be a wave of foreclosure but with the demand out there I don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôll see them selling at a discount like 08-12. They may sell over asking price like current inventory is. 

This is unprecedented territory."

2021-07-01 13:47:51,wallstreetbets,"I agree on the bills part, economic report shows peoples credit card debt is actually going down, aka, buying a house has saved them money over renting. I think the bubble has yet to start."

2021-07-01 13:53:12,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention people who bought for cash arent flipping, they will hold for 10 years until the next bubble and lets not exclude all the people like me who refinanced during covid. Its far from a nice house, but I can now carry this mortgage for life while living in another country. $1100/month 25 minutes from NYC and I can rent it while keeping the basement open for myself (if I retire abroad and want to come back to visit friends). Section 8 in my city pays $1800/month for my bedroom count, and that number will be 2x-3x my mortgage in 5-10 years, making it a non-issue if someone trashes the house because of how high the profit margin is. No one is going to be selling their houses any time soon I think. And those that default, will be bought up at a premium by people who made bank in stocks and are holding cash to diversify their portfolio for the inevitable correction."
2021-07-01 13:55:01,wallstreetbets,"I died, thank you."
2021-07-01 17:36:13,wallstreetbets,"Well, the point is that a bunch of foreclosures *already happened.* They  just haven't been processed by the courts yet for the above mentioned reasons. In effect, 4+ years of ""normal"" foreclosures will hit the market at the same time. And that doesn't account for additional covid related foreclosures - that's just from the government hitting pause with the moratorium. It's genuinely frightening that the government keeps kicking this can down the road. And it screws over smaller landlords like nothing else to boot.

Keep in mind, blackrock is doing the same thing they and other financial institutions did in 2009. During the housing collapse, banks bought a bunch of properties just to keep them from hitting the market and creating a further supply glut. This is containment. Tanking asset values affect their holdings overall, so mitigating that benefits them materially. Yes the housing market tanked after 2008, but it would have tanked so much more had banks not just bought and held a huge amounts of properties."
2021-07-01 19:39:57,wallstreetbets,"You sort of already can turn a 30 year mortgage into 40 years. When you refinance, the clock resets to 30 years again. So if you had only 20 years remaining in your 30 year mortgage, you‚Äôd extend that to 30 years again when refinancing and your monthly payments will go way down."
2021-07-01 18:26:06,wallstreetbets,"Ginnie mae is already talking about this. Would allow mortgage owners to tack on all the accrued interest, exempt homeowners from having to backpay (rather they just extend the life of the loan), and possibly reduce the monthly payment for the homeowner. Obviously it‚Äôs not ideal to tack on 10 years to full payoff, but it‚Äôs a better option than the alternative."
2021-07-01 13:46:54,wallstreetbets,I just foresee an issue over the next 12-36 months when new car supply comes back online and people are MASSIVELY underwater on all the used stuff they‚Äôve purchased over the last 6-12 months.

2021-07-01 13:49:08,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll watch this play. I don‚Äôt care to research this particular issue but I just don‚Äôt see it being a good thing that people are spending so much on depreciating assets.

2021-07-01 14:03:18,wallstreetbets,Exactly. I think a good portion of people who rushed to buy are going to get fucked hard when they realize they are tied down now geographically and are going to take losses when they sell
2021-07-01 18:57:33,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer: I want to apologize if I came off as abrasive. It‚Äôs just my nature when typing, but I was trying to offer a different perspective. I say ‚Äúfuck‚Äù a lot and I had to edit the ‚Äúfucks‚Äù out of that comment. I meant no disrespect because it‚Äôs interesting and something I like to discuss. 

You cannot expect every bubble to be the same. That would be a grave error. So the thought of, ‚Äúwell the people who bought at the top of the last one are breaking even‚Äù is really not good because it took them 14 years to ‚Äúbreak even‚Äù on a primary residence, assuming they kept their home (which they probably didn‚Äôt), all the while having inflation take another bite out of their ass. Most of those people are still not in a good place. I remember these people and families very well and their situation is not that much better. Sure, most of the population is sub-100 IQ and shouldn‚Äôt have made the decisions they did, but that‚Äôs a conversation about personal responsibility. This is a conversation about me and you making money and I don‚Äôt want you to bet wrong. Please do not gamble too much on this in either direction. I‚Äôm not trying to sway you, I‚Äôm just offering perspective. 

About interest rates: You will MOST LIKELY see a severe reaction when the fed starts raising interest rates. There are also many other factors at play that are impossible to predict. 

To answer your question: I‚Äôm 32, and yes, I do own my home. I don‚Äôt own a fucking dime on it, actually. I was very lucky to get it literally a month before COVID hit. If I sold my home to try to get another there are none available in the area‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs a tiny piece  of what‚Äôs different now and it‚Äôs happening all over the place.

2021-07-01 16:06:11,wallstreetbets,"Most of those 10 million homeowners are not underwater thanks to outrageous appreciation in the past year, and most will sell long before a foreclosure happens.

In the case of a foreclosure that moves forward where the property is worth more than what the bank is owed, then cash buyers will buy for a discount.  If the bank still ends up with the property and it is worth more than the loan, the bank will quickly do an REO sale.  There will not be a lot of bank owned properties sitting vacant, driving block values down."

There was a time in the past when actively managed funds did better during downturns than passively managed funds. While that has shifted over the last couple decades there is nothing to say it couldn't swing back. Just because the market as a whole has done better than most traders doesn't mean it always will. 

I still park most of my retirement in low cost passively managed funds, but I think it's also a good idea to take a little risk and pick some individual stocks. Besides giving you the potential for exponential growth, it also keeps you a little more connected to what's going on in the market."

Over the long run the Russell 2000 (Small Cap US Stocks), has actually performed the best. So what are you comparing manager returns too? If you take it even further, pretty much every asset class outside of US stock, fund managers beat the benchmarks on a regular basis with asset classes like International, EM, REITs, Bonds of all types, etc. So if your goal is to only be invested in large US stocks then that is fine, but number one - it‚Äôs not the best historically performing asset class, and number two - it‚Äôs not the only thing you should invest in, since past performance is no guarantee of future results.

If you look at every asset class outside of the US Equities, good managers consistently outperform their respective indexes, ie the EAFE, EM, FTSE NAREIT, etc. The point is that it makes the case for active management since you should be in more than just the US equities. When you look at broadening out diversification of asset classes first, then get to the manager outperformance which is very common when not solely looking at SPX, it‚Äôs pretty easy to argue for some active piece of your overall portfolio."

2021-07-01 12:54:02,wallstreetbets,"Thanks totally forgot about this. Totally agree.
Just bought some."
2021-07-01 13:15:09,wallstreetbets,Literal üöÄüöÄ so excited to see publicly traded space launch stocks!!!
2021-07-01 13:16:12,wallstreetbets,"260 shares at $10.54 and 7 $15 calls
Someone said position or ban then deleted their comment ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2021-07-01 14:20:11,wallstreetbets,In for 300 shares.  Bought more today
2021-07-01 13:57:20,wallstreetbets,Thanx Guys!!!! I‚Äôm in ü§úüèº üíã
2021-07-01 17:40:38,wallstreetbets,">A delivery system like Astra has great potential for military and defense contracts where time is of the essence.

Sounds like a pitch straight from wolf of wall street. 

Bought 100 shares."
2021-07-01 17:32:33,wallstreetbets,Sounds cool but where are these rockets going? Are we evacuating Earth? I missed the memo.
2021-07-01 15:32:43,wallstreetbets,You forgot Rocket Lab. Which is better in every single way
2021-07-01 13:28:06,wallstreetbets,"Not too hopeful about the company, there are a lot of players in the market. If I could I would back Rocket Labs for small launch stuff"
2021-07-01 19:48:44,wallstreetbets,"""ships in 5 storage containers and can be ready for launch with just 5 people from virtually anywhere. ""


Human Trafficking - space edition"
2021-07-01 19:53:39,wallstreetbets,Astra has never put anything in orbit.
2021-07-01 17:02:56,wallstreetbets,Love Astra. Own 500 shares. :)
2021-07-01 14:42:56,wallstreetbets,"Sold made puts on it today, don't even care if I get assigned

Couple hundred shares and a LEAP"
2021-07-01 15:30:33,wallstreetbets,"ASTRA is **NOT** the only publicly traded ""space rocket stock"". That is a ridiculous assertion by u/TheGoldenVault. Lockheed Martin and Northrup Grumman are both publicly traded and guess what? THEY BOTH LAUNCH ROCKETS INTO SPACE! Anyone looking here should be forewarned about ASTRA, they have not had a single successful launch despite multiple attempts. This fact should make investors weary, as usually companies launch an IPO to allow their founders and initial investors to exit and cash in at peak value, or to raise capital to fund a new major project. ASTRA is neither, it has already funded is rocket project and it has thus far failed! To me that indicates that the initial investors have pressured the company into IPOing to allow themselves to jump ship while they still can, and take your money while doing it!"
2021-07-01 12:58:04,wallstreetbets,"Same, I invested in tesla over 5 years ago back at like $50 per share. I sold all of it though at $715 shortly after the 5 to 1 split. But I made sure to buy more on margin before the split lol"
2021-07-01 14:23:47,wallstreetbets,To the moon lol
2021-07-01 17:44:43,wallstreetbets,ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the rockets are for satellite launches/military payloads lol. Spacex is doing a great job so far working towards getting to other planet's.
2021-07-01 17:37:05,wallstreetbets,"CHRIS KEMP ASTRA CEO ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been almost four years since Rocket Lab first got to space, and they‚Äôre still not doing monthly launches, just to give a sense of the relative velocity of the company. We‚Äôre going to be targeting weekly next year, and then we‚Äôre targeting daily within the next couple of years.‚Äù"
2021-07-01 17:29:32,wallstreetbets,"CHRIS KEMP CEO ASTRA ‚ÄúWe can profitably offer launches for half the price of Rocket Lab today. Our critics and Rocket Lab will probably assert we‚Äôre only [launching] 50 kilograms, and they‚Äôre right. But in the next version of the rocket, when we triple or quadruple the payload capacity, we‚Äôre not going to increase the price. At that point, we‚Äôll be both cheaper on a dollars per launch and dollars per kilogram basis ‚Äî and that‚Äôs next year.‚Äù"
2021-07-01 15:46:17,wallstreetbets,"ASTRA is a trash company, its rocket launch attempts have all failed. And OP's statement that ASTRA is the only publicly traded ""space rocket stock"" is an outright lie."
2021-07-01 13:29:54,wallstreetbets,Rocket labs is going public soon but I can't talk about that here.

2021-07-01 17:07:41,wallstreetbets,"Awesome I've been in since the early days, been holding and waiting for the merger to complete. üöÄ"
2021-07-01 17:03:53,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm September RocketLab will also be a public company. Don‚Äôt leave them out‚Ä¶
2021-07-01 17:06:02,wallstreetbets,Last I looked astra has 500 million in funding and according to the CEO thats enough funding till 2025 so there's that too.
2021-07-01 17:25:25,wallstreetbets,"Astra has had a successful launch and has the ability to launch at far less of a cost than all of their competitors because they spent the last four years building their business model that will take over the industry. do those two launch rockets? Yes you‚Äôre right, but they‚Äôre not companies whose sole purpose is to launch. Could they transition, sure. That‚Äôs like saying a new fancy steak restaurant in your town is the first Steak house there when Denny‚Äôs is down the road and happens to have some crap roadkill sirloin. Let‚Äôs be real, anyone looking here should read about Astra and you‚Äôll be informed this company has amazing potential. Your like those grumpy old men that talked shit about Elon when he proposed what he was going to do at Tesla. This company has a solid plan and solid history to back up what they‚Äôre going to do."
2021-07-01 16:06:21,wallstreetbets,"I guess I should have worded that differently and said launch company as in thats their primary focus. My father is a engineer for Northrup so I know quite a bit about them. They make components for rockets, satellites, drones like the fire scout and E2D Hawkeye, and airplanes, but as far as I know they don't assemble full rockets and launch them."
2021-07-01 14:08:39,wallstreetbets,Yeah Rocket Labs better
2021-07-01 18:25:51,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll believe when I see they hit orbit. Highly doubt they‚Äôll be able to scale up to while keeping cost down
2021-07-01 17:50:40,wallstreetbets,Yup. Same.
2021-07-01 17:40:45,wallstreetbets,I'm invested in both but since we can't talk about SPACs here I left them out. I've been following Rocket Labs for years. I think Rocket Labs has huge potential as well but they are a bit more expensive and they don't have the mobility that Astra has. You can ship a Astra rocket in 4-5 shipping containers and have it ready for launch in about a week with 5 or 6 people. As far as I'm aware there isn't another company out there rn that can do that.
2021-07-01 18:03:29,wallstreetbets,"If they have ""enough funding to last to 2025"" the question again needs to be asked: why did they just IPO?"
2021-07-01 17:39:22,wallstreetbets,"The launch that ASTRA claims was ""successful"" was not actually successful. The rocket in question failed to reach orbit after its second stage shut down prematurely. Did the rocket reach space? Yes, but launch customers don't give two shits about ""making it to space"" if their satellites that they paid millions for don't actually make it to their intended orbits. There are two other small launcher companies that are going public soon that have rockets that are proven to work. One of them has had 17 successful launches and has recovered two of its reusable boosters, the other just recently had its first successful launch using similar technology to that used successfully by Orbital Sciences and Northrup Grumman for decades. ASTRA thusfar is a proven failure, while its soon to be IPO'd competitor's are actually successfully launching rockets. So tell me again why someone should invest in this dogshit company when there are others out there actually doing what ASTRA is shilling."
2021-07-01 16:31:41,wallstreetbets,"They most certainly do build and launch rockets. They purchased Orbital ATK in 2017 partially to acquire their aerospace assets which include the Cygnus space freighter and their Minotaur, Antares and Pegasus rocket systems. A Northrup Grumman Antares was launched from Wallops Island in February of this year."
2021-07-01 17:52:16,wallstreetbets,Both solid companies with their own niche in a highly profitable industry. I own both.
2021-07-01 18:09:55,wallstreetbets,As you just mentioned above companies sometimes ipo to aid funding of a new project. Astra plans to increase their payload capabilities while still charging about the same price. When/if that happens customers will be able to launch their payload through Astra at a fraction of the cost of their competitors. It seems to me you didn't do much research before you just started shit talking ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2021-07-01 17:43:22,wallstreetbets,"So your basing this off your definition of a successful launch. GOT IT. If they were concerned about their rockets at that stage they would‚Äôve had more test launches before bidding and winning contracts. That‚Äôs the point your missing is they have their shit in line. I get the fact that it‚Äôs not 100% until it‚Äôs executed. But they wouldn‚Äôt be spending so much time and energy focusing on the costs, assembly, and launchpad program to beat their competitors if they didn‚Äôt think they would reach orbit. They would be spending the time launching as testing  to make sure they reach orbit if they were concerned or if it was an actual issue."
2021-07-01 17:00:10,wallstreetbets,"As far as I can tell the Minotaur is assembled from old government decommissioned missiles with Northrup Grumman engines. That's not quite the same as building a rocket from scratch like astra does. They build 90% of their parts in house to reduce costs. 

Lastly as far as your comments about them being failures they've only done 3 launch attempts and the 3rd was a partial success since their goal was to demonstrate a successful cut off of the main engine. Their 4th attempt will most likely be successful since they've made modifications based of the data of the previous flights.
If you remember back in the early days all spacex rockets exploded and failed too up until the fourth launch and they almost went bankrupt According to Elon Musk."
2021-07-01 17:53:58,wallstreetbets,Regardless of who ends up being higher/more profitable i believe both stocks will be much higher than they currently are given time.
2021-07-01 17:55:25,wallstreetbets,"Its not my definition, its reality. If a space launch company can't put satellites into orbit their product is worthless to the launch market. Take a look at the history behind Space Services, Inc. and their Conestoga rocket. They too had government launch contracts, but after failures the government pulled them and their launch business arm went bust."
2021-07-01 17:01:55,wallstreetbets,Also space.com and business wire were the ones who said Astra is the first launch company to trade on Nasdaq. So maybe they're wrong ü§î
2021-07-01 18:04:20,wallstreetbets,I bet if you followed SpaceX back in the day you would have been talking shit about them too when their 3rd rocket failed. You're so pessimistic look at where SpaceX is today they didn't give up because people like you talked shit about them üòÜ. Prototyping takes time. Your mindset is the same as planting a tree and saying nope its dead because you don't have a 50 ft tall tree in a week. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2021-07-01 18:06:25,wallstreetbets,Also given the time frame Astra has come a long way in 4 years compared to rocket labs 12 years the rate of progress for Astra I feel is faster.

2021-07-01 13:18:36,wallstreetbets,Lmfao
2021-07-01 16:08:52,wallstreetbets,Yeah... Usually when a stock is heavily shorted it's because a lot of people agree that it's going down.
2021-07-01 12:28:43,wallstreetbets,"Been averaging down for the last three weeks or so hoping for a reversal, but I guess it's time to take one on the chin and cash out while there's something left"

2021-07-01 12:43:36,wallstreetbets,Damn well hopefully it turns around still have half a month
2021-07-01 13:13:23,wallstreetbets,Don't average down on a bad option play. Buy a lower strike instead or move the expiry around or something jeez.
2021-07-01 13:23:43,wallstreetbets,"Yes. The first 20 were purchased at $270 per contract, doubled down when it dropped a bit. Biggest mistake was buying around $18k worth when it dipped just a little when I should've either waited for it to dip by a lot or just exited while I could. Cause after that point it kept dipping and I had little choice but to keep averaging down"
2021-07-01 13:20:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah
2021-07-01 15:44:28,wallstreetbets,"Listen, a stock is never a pumper...until it is."

2021-07-01 17:24:06,wallstreetbets,"No, it looks like the thought it would inevitably mean a short squeeze in the future."
2021-07-01 12:51:17,wallstreetbets,Gonna ride it out for a few more days to see if there's a chance to minimize the loss
2021-07-01 13:17:27,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. In retrospect, it was a dumb move"

2021-07-01 12:14:47,wallstreetbets,Bro we yolo money here. Not financial advice
2021-07-01 12:19:18,wallstreetbets,Nobody knows if market will crash. All hype. Do your own DD and invest in companies with solid fundamentals. Can‚Äôt go wrong.
2021-07-01 12:25:45,wallstreetbets,Go ask the guy at H&R Block
2021-07-01 12:26:07,wallstreetbets,"I'm guessing you're getting most of that news from mainstream sources all the fear and terror they pump out daily. They want everyone here to be afraid, pull out, and fail."

2021-07-01 13:34:21,wallstreetbets,If you scared of a market crash you have come to the right place.  Savvy folk around these parts mitigate such risk by wagering themselves into debt by yoloing weeklies.
2021-07-01 18:54:49,wallstreetbets,I would continue as an optimist and keep putting cash in the market. If your worried about inflation start buying tips. If your worried about a crash increase your cash allocation.
2021-07-01 12:54:43,wallstreetbets,"the amount of times ive seen this question in the last week is appalling. Just fucking google this shit, use the internet and do your own DD. for fucks sake people. not to mention there is no correct answer"
2021-07-01 13:10:35,wallstreetbets,If you're really scared buy gold bars
2021-07-01 15:26:04,wallstreetbets,you are possibly witnessing the last greatest bull run before the crash
2021-07-01 16:42:49,wallstreetbets,The economy has been shit and the stock market has been flourishing companies that were bankrupt 6 months ago and their stocks have gone up 7000% thats easy proof of the stock market bubble. Plus unrealized inflation of the USD a big crash is coming dont know when but its definitely coming
2021-07-01 15:52:16,wallstreetbets,crash will mean the inflation is over
2021-07-01 16:40:56,wallstreetbets,Play with a little money but we are in a stock market bubble and all bubbles pop save a fat stack of cash for the crash and load up at that time
2021-07-01 12:20:27,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been wondering the same thing. I see an inevitable crash and hear about it every day. I have long term holdings that have made great gains but hesitate to add stock because I feel it will be much cheaper soon. Ive even considered selling one of my long term because it‚Äôs way behind the others, although I‚Äôve made gains,  but am afraid when it drops it will be well below my average price. I expect many will be but this one I haven‚Äôt the confidence in that I have the others. I‚Äôve been doing a few short term, buy and sells but not adding to my long term stocks. Not sure I‚Äôm doing the right thing."
2021-07-01 13:30:14,wallstreetbets,We also yolo on margin. Also not financial advice.
2021-07-01 13:44:44,wallstreetbets,"Do your own DD? Invest in companies with solid fundamentals?

If they thought that back then the company was worth 10b then this is worth at least 20 billion in market cap today. And since the current market cap is 7.7b just by that conservative estimate the current price per share should be $30 and if not conservative, $36 current fair value checks out."

The direction a company is going, their potential, what people believe it‚Äôs value to be, those are reasons to buy or sell a stock. Maybe just because you like the stock. It doesn‚Äôt matter, but OP‚Äôs claim has absolutely no standing."
2021-07-01 14:51:34,wallstreetbets,"Did I say it was going into GME/AMC? Most of that stimulus money went into food/rent/essentials/maybe a nice thing or two for yourself, or some retards yoloing it into a stock. What I do know is that it didn‚Äôt go into buying shit off of Wish lmao."

2021-07-01 14:57:49,wallstreetbets,"Am I telling you not to buy stock? Absolutely not. Your statement is that people are spending their stimulus money buying *stuff* on Wish, so much so that it could actually affect the stock in any significant way.

If you want to buy the stock I‚Äôm not going to tell you what to do, that‚Äôs your choice. I will however remind you how dumb your *reasoning* is for buying said stock. Of all the possible reasons to buy a stock you chose the worst one to endorse because it‚Äôs not even close to reality. There are other things that can affect the stock, but US stimmy money buying their products is not one of them.

Edit: and my bet still stands. Find me any source that can back that bullshit theory and I‚Äôll pay up."

It very much confuses me that even Reddit and WSB kind of looks the other way when it comes to Cannabis. A site for all but used by a primarily younger generation... It's just an assumption of course but you cant tell me the Fed wouldn't be moving at least  A LITTLE BIT faster on legalization if cannabis stocks got as much reddit/news attention as the same 4-5 stocks they spam about everyday.

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NIO Q2 Earnings Preview: New News June Delivery Numbers. Following NIO's release of June delivery numbers this morning, I am posting my predictions for Q2 financial results. 

&#x200B;

**Current Guidance** ‚Äì **Revenue** & **Deliveries**

**NIO** will report results for the 2021 2nd quarter, ending 6/30 between Jul 20 and Jul 30, 2021. Current Q2 guidance stands at:

¬∑ Revenue between $1.243 - $1.298 Billion

o +2.1-6.5% QoQ growth

¬∑ Vehicle deliveries between 21000 and 22000 vehicles

o +5-10% QoQ growth 

NIO saw declining monthly deliveries from April to May, corresponding with chip shortage. However, the company states that it will accelerate deliveries in June to make up for the delays. 

 

|Model|April|May|
|:-|:-|:-|
|ES8|1523|1412|
|ES6|3163|3017|
|EC6|2416|2282|
|Total|7102|6711|

**My** **Predictions** ‚Äì **Revenue** & **Deliveries**

 These were my predictions prior to June releases, you can see how much I missed/hit the delivery numbers.

|Model|June Prediction|June Actual|%miss|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ES8|1549|1498|\-3.4%|
|ES6|3487|3755|\+7.1%|
|EC6|2838|2830|\-0.3%|
|Total|7874|8083|\+2.59%|

  Therefore, incorporating the news and improvements in pricing, I predict:

¬∑ Revenue between 1.33-1.1.38 billion

o 9 ‚Äì 13% QoQ Revenue Growth

¬∑ Gross Margin between 19.53-19.63%

o 5-15 bps improvement

¬∑ Vehicle Margin between 21.16-22%

o 0-4 bps improvement

¬∑ Adj. EPS (0.02)¬±0.01"

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Micron dumps after stellar ER - thoughts on future so micron has a record ER, and guides higher but the market dumps.

Anyone who has held Micron who a couple years knows this story. 

For those who lost their ass on weeklies - this is why I say dont do weeklies on micron. 

Why is it dumping? Partially because of people getting margin called and closing out their weeklies. STOP DOING IT. 

So anyway on to the report:

[https://investors.micron.com/static-files/a62938c1-846b-40e2-b0dc-d5e921c16c7e](https://investors.micron.com/static-files/a62938c1-846b-40e2-b0dc-d5e921c16c7e)

 ‚ñ™ Expect CY-21 DRAM industry bit demand growth to be somewhat above 20%, with DRAM industry supply below demand; there is currently unmet demand for DRAM due to end market strength and we expect the DRAM market to remain tight into CY-22 

‚ñ™ Expect CY-21 NAND industry bit demand growth in the mid 30% range, with NAND supply below demand; we also see the NAND market as tight into CY-22 

‚ñ™ Long-term DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid-to-high teens 

‚ñ™ Long-term NAND bit demand growth CAGR of approximately 30% Micron 

‚ñ™ Targeting to align our long-term bit supply growth CAGR with the industry bit demand growth CAGR across DRAM and NAND 

‚ñ™ CY-21 DRAM and NAND Micron bit supply growth expected to be below industry demand growth 

‚ñ™ Placed orders for multiple EUV tools from ASML as part of long-term agreement 

‚ñ™ FY21 Capex revised to somewhat above $9.5 bn; mostly from areas that don‚Äôt impact CY21 and CY22 bit growth such as EUV pre-payments, construction spending and other R&D and corporate items 

Now during the call, analysts seemed to really dig in deep into Sanjays comments re purchasers shifting from ""just in time"" models to ""just in case"" models. They think this indicates previous purchases were above actual consumption and intended to raise inventory. As such they expect weakening demand and pricing moving forward. 

I disagree with their fears. Sanjay guides in a way so that he can smash at ER. He has done this for Micron and he has done with Sandisk before they got bought out at WDC. Have a look at previous earnings and whether they beat or not. 

expand table to see more dates on links below

[https://www.streetinsider.com/ec\_earnings.php?q=sndk](https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?q=sndk) (Sanjay for all of it)

[https://www.streetinsider.com/ec\_earnings.php?sort=earning\_date&q=mu](https://www.streetinsider.com/ec_earnings.php?sort=earning_date&q=mu) (Sanjay from Q3 2017)

Sanjay knows markets dont like surprise, so he guides low. Hes also been in Semi industry forever. Hes not an idiot. So when he says guidance is X, I take guidance to be X + extra for the beat. I dont freaking think I need to discount the guidance because purchasers increasing inventory. Sanjay has priced that shit in. 

So thats inventory and guidance. 

What about the sale to Texas Instruments? Thats not linked to RAM or NAND really. Kinda but not really. Thats them giving up on (3dx point) Intel Octane. There was no market for it so keeping the plant was costing them 500 mil a year since it was under-utilised. However they kept all the IP from Octane in case it comes back to life later on. Its basically non volatile RAM which can be used as storage - sounds really cool but  I am guessing its expensive AF so people dont want it yet. Again, selling this plant is basically good for micron. We want higher margins to run a slick operation. 

I dont really like toms hardware but this article explains the sale the best. Other news stories on it say there was a sale but doesnt really tell you much about about the background.

[https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/micron-to-sell-3d-xpoint-fab-to-texas-instruments-for-dollar900-million](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/news/micron-to-sell-3d-xpoint-fab-to-texas-instruments-for-dollar900-million)

What is driving increasing margin? Well Micron is using DUV (deep ultra violet) with computational lithography and multiple masks to achieve smaller resolution on DRAM. Samsung are achieving same resolution with EUV. EUV costs a bunch and ASML are the only supplier. You should probably get into ASML at some point as well WSB but thats a post for another day. As such, Microns margins for latest tech DRAM is way lower than Samsung. SK Hynix is the third player in RAM and they are playing catchup - seem a bit fucked to me personally. Nanya is the 4th player and realllllly small and think they are just screwed. Dont have the money to get into EUV so next few generations, they will be so far behind they just get bought out if any competition regulatory body allows it (at near bankruptcy stage is my guess). 

Now Micron is starting to invest in EUV which is good and they have given themselves a lead time for 2 years which feels about right to me. In 2023 we will see if they are still at cutting edge of RAM vs Samsung who will have a 2 year head start into EUV production. This is the only concern to me. In this time, they will gain the benefit of reduced pricing for EUV tech and additional expertise from ASML who will be helping Micron to achieve results. I am hoping they can transplant their specialist know how from DUV to EUV (that everyone else didnt manage to do at this resolution), but at this stage, my science ability is woefully unable to track it meaningfully.

Lets look at Microns plan for EUV and the interim releases until then.  

[https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/01/micron-dram-node-shrink-roadmap/](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/12/01/micron-dram-node-shrink-roadmap/)

So you can see we are currently at 1 alpha node for 10nm in 2021. We have 1 beta and 1 gamma to go planned (still using DUV) before 1 delta which is when EUV should kick in. Thats a new node every year still using DUV. Thats sweet if it works out. In the interim Micron gets to print money like nobodys business (higher margin from DUV) and continue hiring R&D people with EUV knowledge from Korea and Japan. 

I have a small long position in micron. I dont really care about short term price movements. I expect this to be higher in 3 to 6 months. Thats what I care about. I expect it to be higher in 12 months. Beyond that I want to see how their 1 beta and 1 gamma nodes are coming along with updates as to 1 delta using EUV. 

We are trading at price levels from Jan/Feb this year. We have had 2 great ERs since then. I dont see TAM in RAM or NAND dropping any time soon or pricing (thesis of tacit collusion as to supply/pricing in oligopolies - we arent cyclical market anymore because 3 market players control like 98% of the DRAM production in the world - its why they are not dumping on capex - its intentional). 

this is good price to buy, but dont expect results in a week or even a month. We might trade sideways for a while. Shake out the paper hands before funds buy back in at discount and ramp up for next ER. You cant time the ramp up, you just have to be in the stock at a decent price (like now) and then wait for it to happen."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The BEST Palantir Analysis Around! **Valuation: Undervalued**

***$PLTR ‚Äì Palantir Technologies Inc Investment Summary:***

¬∑ Recently, there has been a lot of excitement around Palantir, however, very few people actually understand what they do and how they operate. As a result of this I have decided to take on the task of trying explain exactly what Palantir does and why they could be the best undervalued stock to buy now.

o I am no data engineer, so this article contains my interpretations of what Palantir does, some of my interpretations may be off, so I would appreciate any helpful comments to clear some things up that I may have got wrong.

¬∑ Based on the comparable analyses that I underwent, Palantir is currently an undervalued stock and represents a great opportunity for a long-term hold.

o The length of time that I plan on holding is subject to change due to their future financial reports, and any news that may come out.

¬∑ It is very hard to say what the upside potential of an investment into Palantir is, which is why my investment plan (found in the ‚Äúplan‚Äù section) is different than usual.

o There are various risks to this investment (like there are to every investment), these risks are highlighted near the end of this report under the ‚Äúrisks‚Äù section.

o Additionally, there are also multiple different catalysts that can help Palantir‚Äôs share price, both in the short and long term(s). These catalysts are listed at the end of this report.

***Overview of Palantir as a Company:***

[$PLTR - Palantir Technologies Inc.](https://utradea.com/stocks/PLTR) was founded in 2003 (after their fear/anger after the events observed through 9/11) and started building their software primarily for government institutions and intelligence to assist in counterterrorism by any means possible. At this point in time, Palantir‚Äôs only source of revenue was through secretive government contracts.

However, since that point in time, Palantir has expanded their operations into commercial enterprises, as they noticed a lot of similarities and overlaps with their applications. Now, Palantir‚Äôs revenue comes from both Government Contracts and Commercial Enterprise Contracts.

*Palantir has 2 main software platforms, Palantir ‚ÄúGotham‚Äù, and Palantir ‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù.*

[**Palantir Gotham**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/) was their first software platform and was designed for defense/intelligence use cases. Palantir has stated that this kind of platform helps agencies find ‚Äúneedles in thousands of haystacks‚Äù. They also noted that [Gotham helped soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan](https://www.palantir.com/wp-assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Impact-Study-Palantir-Defense-During-Drawdown.pdf) to map networks of bomb makers and insurgents through deep/hidden patterns and datasets, helping the army save time and lives. Since this mission, Gotham has expanded into defense operations and mission planning. During this time, Palantir found that Gotham could also be applied in Airbus‚Äô business, as their planes require millions of parts, assembled in multiple factories in different countries. However, Palantir decided to make another software platform that is better tailored to commercial enterprises, this platform was labelled ‚ÄúPalantir Foundry‚Äù.

[**Palantir Foundry**](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/) transforms the way in which organizations interact with their information by creating a central operating system for their data. Palantir enables their customers to construct their own models quickly and easily from countless sets of data points.

Palantir software is used by their 139 Government and Commercial Institutions/enterprises, in over 40 industries, ranging over 150 countries. Palantir works with the US Government and their several allies abroad, as well as the worlds most important/reliable companies.

Lastly, Palantir has stated ‚ÄúWe are not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. We build the software that enable our customers to integrate their own data that they already have.‚Äù

***Everything you need to know about Palantir and $PLTR:***

*Palantir Foundry:*

Foundry is essentially a [data warehouse](https://panoply.io/data-warehouse-guide/the-difference-between-a-database-and-a-data-warehouse/) that helps their commercial customers to collect and analyze their data. Foundry‚Äôs platform includes a [graphical data interface](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/graphical-user-interface) that is extremely user friendly allowing their customers to get the most out of their data. Furthermore, Foundry provides statistical analyses through the use of their [AI machine learning](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/ai-ml/) networks that are able to consistently deliver efficient and accurate results.

Foundry helps to enables all of their users, regardless of their technical abilities, to work meaningfully and act with the data that they collect. Foundry provides a suite of applications that help combine data analytics and business logic, helping them to deliver superior data integration.

Foundry‚Äôs front-end (what the user sees) enables their users to take advantage of all of the data collected by their organization to make informed decisions. Foundry also has a fantastic application for inter-organizational collaboration, this helps a team to build on each others work.

*Foundry brings all of an enterprises data together onto their platform, however there are access controls in place to define what individuals get control over which dataset(s). From there, Foundry is able to deliver advanced analytics through their machine learning and AI systems to get the most value out of a company‚Äôs data, make quality insights, so that their clients can gain a competitive advantage.*

**Foundries potential use cases are almost infinite.**

*Palantir Gotham:*

Dubbed ‚ÄúThe Operating System for Government Decision Making‚Äù, Gotham helps to improve and accelerate decisions across all levels of Government operations.

Gotham is primarily used by the defense and intelligence sections of the Government, to help them find what they are looking for. Gotham collects data from millions of different sources and combines it all into one platform to identify hidden patterns and bring all of this data to life. This allows their users to access this data and manage their operations to execute real-world responses to threats that Gotham identifies. Gotham is becoming a main data solution across various different government agencies.

There is not too much information that is publicly known about the actual uses of Gotham, which makes sense due to the secretive nature of the organizations that they are in business with. However, what we do know is that these organizations have re-signed contracts with Palantir, which helps us to be confident that this platform is truly ‚Äúthe real deal‚Äù.

Lastly, Gotham is also offered to select commercial customers, primarily the companies that are investigating fraud in financial service industries. Furthermore, [Palantir has been credited](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2015/01/12/leaked-documents-bernie-madoff-convicted-thanks-to.html) with assisting in finding the largest Ponzi scheme ever (Bernie Madoff‚Äôs Ponzi Scheme).

*Gotham helps the Defense and Intelligence sectors of the Government to pool their incomprehensible amounts of data into one place. Palantir uses machine learning to quickly locate hidden pieces of data, and key patterns, so that these institutions can take swift action to the threats/problems they face in real-time.*

*Palantir‚Äôs Approach:*

Palantir believes that every large institution in the world has a problem in their approach to mass data analysis, and Palantir believes that their platforms are best suited to help companies address this problem and make the most out of their data.

Palantir recognises that other companies sell features, tools, applications, and/or dashboards, however these products are not built to maintain optimal performance in the long run (if at all). Palantir prides themselves on having the best all around software/platform to have sustainable, reliable, and safe data solutions.

Palantir also groups their Foundry data from all of their companies into one large system of several large ‚Äúfarms‚Äù of data provided by each of their client companies. By doing this, Palantir is able to feed more data/information into their machine learning, AI, and algorithms so that they can continue to be more reliable and efficient. This also enables [cross-industry data pools](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU), that can be used by their companies when they look to expand or for opportunities in other verticals.

*Palantir Success Stories:*

**BP:**

Perhaps the most notable success story that has come from Palantir is their partnership with [$BP ‚Äì British Petroleum](https://utradea.com/stocks/BP)

BP and Palantir have been partners since 2014, and recently (February 2021) [BP and Palantir have extended their partnership](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/05/palantir-deepens-ties-with-bp-with-new-5-year-deal/) for 5 more years. Palantir has helped BP to transform their business into a more digital one, and this extension of their partnership will ensure a further acceleration of their strategic digitization of their business.

Palantir‚Äôs Foundry has already helped BP by streamlining and enhancing their hydrocarbon-based workflows. Palantir helped BP to analyze their drilling data and has helped them to [increase their oil production in the North Sea by over 10%.](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/palantir-the-tech-spooks-who-found-bin-laden-are-helping-bp-find-oil-9qddfpv2r)

This increase in production helps us to visualize just how useful Palantir‚Äôs software can be. This is why their Foundry has been credited as a ‚Äúcompetitive advantage‚Äù. Other oil producing companies most likely would not have been able to uncover the data, patterns, and relationships that were uncovered by Palantir, thus the companies that are not using Palantir may be losing out.

This type of publicity is fantastic for Palantir, as companies may see this, and contact Palantir because they too want a competitive advantage. Palantir‚Äôs best chance at becoming the next ‚Äútech giant‚Äù comes through the commercial applications/contracts. This is because there are infinite uses for Palantir, so theoretically, they can get it in the hands of every business (which would help revenues to soar).

**National Institute of Health (NIH) and Britain‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS):**

Palantir has historically been a rather controversial company through their help in government agencies like ICE. However, recently Palantir has been getting good press, which has helped their company image. Since the start of the pandemic some institutions like the NIH and NHS have signed contracts with Palantir, for Palantir‚Äôs assistance with their fights against COVID-19, and their vaccine distributions. This is good for Palantir as it shows them in a good light and shows that they can help provide the world with help and safety during a crisis like COVID-19.

The NIH agreed to a [$36M contract](https://www.palantir.com/pt_media/nih-palantir-contract/) to gain a partnership with Palantir. Their (NIH‚Äôs), mission is to build the largest centralized COVID-19 patient database in the world, and Palantir has helped them to do this with massive success.

Palantir was able to assist the NIH in building their [N3C data platform](https://covid.cd2h.org/). This platform has come a long way since they teamed up with Palantir, and now has over 7.1B rows of data from 6.5M patients, from 57 different databases. Without the assistance of Palantir, analyzing this amount of data would have been no easy feat, however Palantir has provided the NIH with advanced analytics in the matter of minutes thank to their machine learning capabilities.

Additionally, in December of 2020, Palantir signed a [2-year $31.5M deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201223005018/en/Palantir-Continues-Vital-NHS-Work-With-31.5M-Contract) with the Brittan‚Äôs NHS. This partnership requires Foundry to provide a secure, reliable, and timely platform to process data, while protecting patient privacy, to ultimately improve patient care.

Both of these partnerships highlight the need for Palantir during a crisis and having these large Government Health Institutes choosing Palantir as their first options is a great deal, and shows their confidence in Palantir‚Äôs software.

*Sources:*

[The power of data in a pandemic - Technology in the NHS (blog.gov.uk)](https://healthtech.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/28/the-power-of-data-in-a-pandemic/)

*Strengths:*

**Built-in Privacy Controls:**

By having [privacy controls](https://youtu.be/7zqE8J4WKOU) in place, Palantir is able to operate in places that other data companies cannot go. This is especially true for Foundry, where companies/individuals can request cross-industry data from other Palantir clients to help them in a variety of ways. This request for external data needs to be accepted by a representative of the other company to be allowed. This helps Palantir leverage all of the data that they have on their ‚ÄúOperating System‚Äù, which essentially makes their platform a cross-company/cross-country collaborative workspace for all. As Palantir attains more clients, the more attractive/extensive their database is for potential clients. This should help Palantir to expand quickly once they get the ball rolling.

Palantir truly values this privacy and has integrated data legibility, audit logs, access controls, quality checks and requirements to attain external data.

**Government Grade Security:**

As we know, Palantir started out in just the defense and intelligence spaces. This required Palantir to have elite-level security from the get-go. Their software had to be secure enough to handle national secrets and transparent enough to ensure that the data could be monitored and traced. This is no easy feat, however Palantir managed to achieve this, which is why they have been renewing their contracts with several government agencies.

This is important when trying to sell their products to their commercial clients, because they need something safe and reliable to protect themselves and their data. Furthermore, Palantir currently has [IL-5 clearance](https://simplemoneylyfe.com/palantir-stock-analysis/) with the Department of Defense (DoD), which makes them 1 of 4 software companies with this level of clearance (alongside Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP). However, it has also been rumoured that Palantir may achieve IL-6 clearance, which has never been done before as it is the storage/processing of **classified information.**

This level of clearance should speak volumes to how safe and secure Palantir‚Äôs technology truly is and should provide ease of mind to companies that they are in business with.

**Expansion into the Commercial Sector:**

Palantir currently has a huge opportunity ahead of them as they continue to increase their presence in the commercial sector, partnering with some of the largest enterprises in the world. Palantir plans to provide these businesses with the software that they need to do their jobs as efficient as possible and sees large growth potential in this industry.

Palantir has said that they are focusing on building partnerships with enterprises that are willing to undergo structural changes within the organization/operations. Palantir has a huge market ahead of themselves in the commercial sector, and their stock should do well on the news breaking of new partnerships between Palantir and commercial enterprises.

*Government Contracts:*

Do you remember what I said earlier about what happens once Palantir gets the ball rolling? If so, you will know where I am headed with this section.

Between 2008-2018 (10 years), Palantir was able to generate $51.9M in revenue from government contracts. However, in the 2 years following this they earned $179.9M in Government contracts (this can be found under the ‚ÄúUS Government‚Äù section of their [SEC 10-K report](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)). Once Palantir was able to get the ball rolling with these agencies, Palantir was able to both expand and renew existing contracts to earn more revenue. I believe that the same thing will happen with Palantir‚Äôs commercial operations. Once they start to get a large number of big enterprises renewing their contracts for ‚Äúbigger bucks‚Äù, I believe that Palantir will start to grow their revenues extremely quick and attract new clients ‚Äúleft, right, and center‚Äù.

These contract renewals are so important because essentially, they mean that Palantir met and/or exceeded expectations, and these companies now believe that Palantir is vital to their business/operations, so look out for news around renewals.

*Business Model:*

Palantir has developed a business model that focuses on acquiring contracts and expanding their services and has 3 main phases.

1. **Acquire Customers:** Palantir has expanded their sales force largely over the past couple of years, and actively purse negotiations with companies that they can provide long-term value to. To acquire these companies, Palantir gives them a short demo to see how effective and user friendly their software is, Palantir provides this service for a loss. However, they are willing to incur these (proportionately) small losses to potentially acquire large contracts with these companies. This phase runs at a loss but helps Palantir set up clients for the next phase.
2. **Expand:** Once Palantir has a potential customer on the hook, they move them along to the expand phase. Palantir installs their software in these enterprises and teaches them the ropes, of course this requires a large investment from Palantir to incorporate it. These customers often sign a short contract with Palantir for a cheap cost (Palantir takes a loss on this phase as well), however clients are able to truly unlock Palantir‚Äôs software during this phase and see what it has to offer. If they like their software, they will be moved along to the next phase (scale) which is Palantir‚Äôs bread and butter.
3. **Scale:** These clients tend to sign longer-term deals with Palantir for their software after they have got a ‚Äúgood feel‚Äù for their software. The companies in this stage are also generally ‚Äúhands-off‚Äù meaning that they can operate the software without much help. Companies tend to find the most value in this stage, and Palantir makes the best margins on this stage. In 2020, Palantir made $613.4M in this stage with a margin of 70%

*Financial information:*

All of this information can be found in their [SEC 10-K filing.](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1)

¬∑ **Financial Performance (Good):** In 2020, Palantir increased their gross profit by 47.97% and increased their gross margin to 81% (from 71%), Palantir reported their first net income (excluding stock-based compensation) ever and increase their net revenues by 47.15%.

¬∑ **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Palantir‚Äôs loss from operations increased by 103.61%, their stock-based compensation increased by 425.15%, their General and Admin expenses increased by 108.59%, and their net loss increased by 101.22%. Their biggest problem in 2020 was their large stock-based compensation, which will be addressed later.

¬∑ **Convertible Preferred Stock:** In 2020, Palantir issued a total of 797,771,675 shares of common stock through conversion of their previous ‚Äúconvertible referred shares‚Äù. This one factor of dilution caused an estimated dilutionary effect of Palantir‚Äôs stock of 137.19%. This is a huge form of dilution, and I have never seen anything like this before, however I have an explanation for this so stay tuned for that.

¬∑ **Repurchase of Common Stock:** In 2020, Palantir repurchased 808,201 shares back. This is a measly amount compared to the amount of dilution from preferred stock, however any buyback is good to see as an investor. This buyback caused an inflationary effect on existing shares of 0.14%, which is not much, but we will still take it.

¬∑ **Stock Warrants:** In 2020, Palantir experienced an additional 7,631,329 shares on the market through the exercising of warrants. The exercising of these warrant had a dilutionary effect on Palantir‚Äôs stock of 1.31%.

¬∑ **Common Stock (Net of Issuance Costs):** In 2020, Palantir unloaded 206,500,523 common shares onto the market from issuance of common stock net of issuance costs. I believe that this means that, Palantir had to fork out additional shares to cover the investment needed to take their shares public. I could very well be wrong on that, and if anyone can pitch in and explain this to me that would be great! Anyways, this caused a dilutionary effect of Palantir‚Äôs common stock of roughly 35.51%. This is a large portion of dilution, however it does not even factor in other factors of dilution which is worrying.

¬∑ **Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir added 120,617,527 common shares to their shares outstanding through the exercise of options. These options were exercised and thus converted into these common shares and had a dilutionary effect of 20.72%. Once again, this is a large amount of dilution and should be considered by investors.

¬∑ **RSU‚Äôs:** In 2020, Palantir issued 82,429,575 shares through their vesting of ‚ÄúRestricted Stock Units‚Äù (RSU‚Äôs). This had a dilutionary effect on their stock of 14.18% (which is a lot of dilution).

¬∑ **Modification to Stock Options:** In 2020, Palantir technically bought back 3,500,0000 shares through modifications to stock options (for the settlement of employee loans accounted for as modifications to stock options). Confusing, right? This technical buyback resulted in a share inflation of 0.6%.

¬∑ **Total Share Dilution in 2020:** In 2020, Palantir experience an overall share dilution of 208.19%. This is the most dilution I have ever seen in a stock that I have analyzed, however there are some potential answers as to why there was so much dilution in 2020.

*Explanation of Share Dilution:*

Once again, all of the below information can be found in Palantir‚Äôs [SEC 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-060650/#tx65934_1).

On September 30th, 2020, Palantir completed their Direct Listing of their Class A common shares on the public markets on the NYSE. Part of this listing involved the redemption of all of Palantir‚Äôs convertible share into common shares. This was the largest single source of dilution in Palantir (137%). Additionally, this Direct Listing involved the exercise of al outstanding warrants, which resulted in dilution of 1.31%. Another part of their Direct Listing was the common stocks issued, net of issuance price to complete the direct listing, which had a dilutionary effect of 35.51%. Lastly, Palantir was forced to create new common shares that would hold the place of the unvested RSU‚Äôs, which cause a dilutionary effect of 14.18%.

Without these factors of dilution, Palantir would have only experienced an overall dilution of 20%. This means that due to the Direct listing, Palantir had to increase their shares outstanding by 188.19% to meet the requirements to be eligible for the listing.

*Overall Thoughts on Dilution:*

Palantir is a very weird stock in terms of their dilution, and I have not seen anything quite like this before. Their overall level of dilution is unprecedented and very worrying for investors. However, we know that these levels of dilution were inflated due to the requirements of undergoing a Direct Listing. However, how does Palantir dilution (excluding the effects caused by their Direct Listing compared to their dilution in previous years?

For starters, Palantir exhibited a 20% share dilution in 2020 when eluding the dilution caused by the Direct Listing. However, historically Palantir has experienced an average share dilution of 5.18% between 2017-2019. So even excluding the effects caused through the Direct Listing, Palantir still experienced a comparably high level of share dilution. However, 20% of dilution is significantly different than the 208.19% of dilution (which would be crazily high). This 20% is relatively normal for an undervalued growth stock, such as Palantir, so currently I would not be too worried. However, investors should keep up with their financial reports and look for their dilution in 2021, because ultimately that will tell us more about Palantir‚Äôs dilution after going public, than their past share dilution as a private company.

*Competition:*

In order to undergo my comparable analyses (which will be discussed later on) I needed to select 4 companies, that I can compare to Palantir.

[**$ZS ‚Äì Zscaler Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/ZS)**:** ZScaler is a security as a service company that helps company adapt to cloud technologies and provides their cybersecurity services through the cloud. ZScaler provides their services to both commercial enterprises and governments, similar to that of Palantir. Furthermore, ZScaler offers their service primarily in the USA, but also has smaller international operations (again like Palantir).

[**$SNOW ‚Äì Snowflake Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SNOW)**:** Snowflake (like Palantir) is a software and technology company that primarily focuses on data. Snowflake provides data cloud services such as data engineering, data science, data applications, data sharing, and data warehouse. This is very similar to the applications and functions available on Palantir, however Palantir offers other functions that differentiate themselves. Snowflake also provides services for both commercial enterprises and government organizations, similar to that of Palantir.

[**$SPLK ‚Äì Splunk Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/SPLK)**:** Splunk provide software platforms that deliver insights derived from their clients‚Äô data in the USA and internationally. Splunk offers their Ecosystem solutions that consist of data inputs, workflows, reports, dashboards, data visualizations, actions, and methods, and help their clients/customers to make the best out of their data. All of this sounds eerily familiar to the description of Palantir, making it one of the closer competitors. Splunk also offers their services to the public sector as well as the government, making their business model resemble that of Palantir so much more.

[**$TYL ‚Äì Tyler technologies Inc**](https://utradea.com/stocks/TYL)**:** Tyler technologies is probably the company in this list that least resembles that of Palantir, this is because they provide management solutions, accounting systems, billing systems and other solutions geared toward the public sector. Tyler technologies works primarily with governments of all types (Federal, State, and Municipal), and education institutions. However, the one thing that Tyler has that makes them comparable to Palantir is their data and insight solutions. Their data insights software enables collaboration, displays data visualizations/measurements, and generates insights for their human operators to act on.

*Q1 2021 Updates:*

All of the below information can be found in [Palantir‚Äôs Q1 Investor Presentation](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q1%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf).

Recently, on May 11th, 2021, Palantir released their Q1 earnings report. When looking at Palantir‚Äôs financial performance I did not take this into account, which means that this section will be packed with new information that will help us to understand Palantir‚Äôs trajectory even more.

First and foremost, this quarter was the first quarter in which Palantir has reported positive earnings. This is a big milestone for Palantir as a public company, and it helps to gets investors excited about the potentially profitable future of Palantir. In Q1, Palantir reported a free cash flow of $151M (was -$290M in Q1 2020) with a 44% adjusted FCF margin, they grew revenues by 49% YoY ($341M), and they grew billings by 248% YoY ($362M) which means that Palantir is acquiring new customers and negotiating higher contracts. These financials are great and show a promising future ahead for Palantir, which should excite their investors.

Furthermore, during this quarter they also disclosed their investment in a SPAC. This SPAC is [$QELL ‚Äì Qell Acquisition Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/QELL) which merging with Lilium. Lilium is an eVTOL transportation company, with this investment they also came to a deal with Lilium to use Foundry for design, engineering, testing, production, quality, logistics, and operations. A while back I looked at another eVTOL SPAC Archer ([$ACIC ‚Äì Atlas Crest Investment Corp.](https://utradea.com/stocks/ACIC)), which has great upside and has a similar business model to Lilium, so if you want to read that to be more informed about Liliums potential performance, [click here.](https://utradea.com/positions/Take_a_SHOT_at_Archers_SPAC_ACIC)

In Q1, Palantir was also awarded with a [5-year $90M contract](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210405005238/en/Palantir-Selected-by-the-National-Nuclear-Security-Administration-for-5-year-89.9M-Contract-for-SAFER-Project) from the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), in which Palantir will provide the operational platform for their SAFER (Safety Analytics, Forecasting, and Evaluation Reporting) project. This is big news as this is one of Palantir‚Äôs bigger contracts, and it shows the level of confidence of the NNSA in Palantir‚Äôs software and their cross-enterprise data integration capabilities. On the topic of Palantir and Government Organizations, the DoD used Palantir‚Äôs software in all 11 of their Combatant Commands for globally integrated intelligence. This high level of usage from the DoD definitely means that Palantir is doing something right, and if the DoD likes it so much, then it should be more than enough for commercial enterprises.

Lastly, in Q1, Palantir won 15 contracts worth over $5M, and 6 contracts worth over $10M with an average duration of 3.7 years (4.6 for commercial customers). This is fantastic for the company as they gained an additional 11 new commercial customers from this, and I will be keeping up to date with these contracts and others as they come up for renewal/negotiations. Additionally, Palantir was able to grow their gross margin to 83% (from 75% Q1 2020), and their contribution margin to 60% (from 41% in Q1 2020). This shows that Palantir business partners are maturing into their 3rd phase, the scale phase, which enables Palantir to grow their margins.

***$PLTR ‚Äì Palantir Investment Valuation:***

*Comparable Analyses:*

I decided to undergo 2 different comparable analyses in order to get a variety of valuations (or opinions if you will). Preferably, I would like both of these results to be consistent in terms of their fair value estimate, however, if they are not consistent, I will take the average result. I was only able to find 2 multiples/ratios that I could actually analyze due to the nature of these businesses and their lack of positive financial ratios/multiples.

*EV/Revenue:*

This is a very common multiple among companies that are not profitable in their operations yet, like Palantir and some of these other comparable companies. By comparing Palantir‚Äôs EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (listed above on the ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù section of this report), I found that Palantir has a fair value of $32.85/share, which implies an upside to this investment of 23.31%. This implies that given Palantir‚Äôs current price, they are undervalued, and the upside is very reasonable, however, I decided to undergo the next comparable to see if this result maintains.

*P/B:*

By comparing Palantir‚Äôs P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $24.87/share, which implies that there is a downside risk of 6.64% to such an investment. As you have probably noticed, these results are not consistent, therefore I have decided to take the average result to get one, final price target.

*Average Comparable:*

By taking the average result from the 2 comparable analyses underwent, I found that Palantir has a fair value of $28.86/share, which implies an overall upside of 8.36% to this investment. This also implies that Palantir, is in fact an undervalued growth stock, that has the potential to be one of the best undervalued stocks on the market.

***My Plan for Investing into Palantir:***

My plan for this investment is a little different from usual.

I see anything between $24.87/share (Fair Value of P/B ratio) and $28.86/share (average comparable) as a good chance to buy Palantir at (or below) its fair value. This helps to limit our downside risk of this investment.

However, I think the best way to play an investment in Palantir is over the long-run 3+ years. I would attempt to buy in at the above prices and hold for these 3+ years. During this time, I would re-evaluate my investment with every new financial report and piece of news to decide if it is still worth holding.

***Potential Risks to Palantir‚Äôs Stock - $PLTR:***

¬∑ **Dilution:** Over the past year Palantir has experienced a lot of dilution, however, we have already attributed a great deal of this dilution to their Direct Listing. However, the 20% of dilution that was not derived from the direct listing is still quite high. As investors, we should keep an eye on their future levels of dilution to recognize any patterns/increases that we should be weary of. If these levels of dilution persist, potential investors may be scares off and current investor might sell their positions, which will hurt the share price.

¬∑ **Financial Performance:** This year‚Äôs financial performance was not one to be overly happy about. Although they were able to increase some pretty important aspects of their balance sheet, Palantir was still yet to make a profit, and increased their net losses by over 100%. If this poor financial performance continues, and they keep digging themselves into a bigger and bigger hole, investors will run away from this stock and never look back. However, the Q1 financial performance gives investors hope for a more profitable future, which will be discussed later.

¬∑ **Bad Press:** Historically, Palantir has not been looked at through a positive lens by many people investors and non-investors alike. Their first public backlash came through their involvement in deporting immigrants through [Palantir‚Äôs partnership with ICE](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54348456). Palantir quicky spoke out against this backlash by saying ICE took advantage of their software without proper oversight, and that they are looking into the issues, furthermore they have since declined some potential partnerships with other border agencies to avoid further backlash. There have also been numerous smaller controversies and protests that have damaged Palantir‚Äôs reputation, and if there are more large controversies Palantir‚Äôs stock could get hurt as a result of it.

***Potential Catalysts that can Help Palantir‚Äôs Stock Price:***

¬∑ **Share Buybacks:** Over the past year, Palantir has bought back (both directly and indirectly, in a sense) over 4,300,000 of their common shares. This is good to see as an investor, especially this early in the company (and not too long after their Direct Listing). This gives me hope that Palantir will continue to repurchase more shares in the future. This will be good for the share price as it will increase the value of existing shares, and it will be especially good for the stock price if they continue to buyback more shares each year.

¬∑ **Financial Performance:** Palantir‚Äôs 2020 financial report was not favourable (as discussed previously), however there were definitely some good to take out of it. Palantir increased their revenue, gross profit, and margins by a hefty amount, which is good to see as an investor, however, there was bad aspects of this report as well that made the report unfavourable. However, their newly released Q1 2021 financial report has so much more to offer in terms of good aspects of a financial report.

¬∑ **Positive Press:** As previously mentioned, Palantir has had their fair share of bad press that has had a small effect on their share price. However, recently Palantir has been getting better press through helping organizations like the NIH and NHS in their fight against COVID-19, and their vaccine distribution efforts. Partnerships like this help to display the positive impacts that can be derived from Palantir‚Äôs technology. Future events where Palantir can use their software for a good cause can help to combat the negative stigma around Palantir and attract more people to invest in their company. This should help their share price in the short term after these articles are released.

¬∑ **Success Stories:** Since Palantir have gone public, they have had a few success stories come out, I mentioned some of these stories throughout the article. These success stories show how impactful Palantir‚Äôs software can be and can show companies that they can increase revenues, production etc. just by using Palantir‚Äôs software. Any future stories like this that come out, highlighting the benefits of Palantir can help the stock soar, and potential clients to reach out and start business/inquiries with Palantir.

¬∑ **Renewing Contracts:** I have mentioned that the renewal of contracts can help Palantir‚Äôs share price a couple times throughout this article but why is this the case? This is because these companies that are renewing have already been through Palantir‚Äôs 3 stage business model and have experienced their software firsthand for numerous years. After their time with Palantir‚Äôs software expires they decide to renew the contract. This is good because it shows that Palantir‚Äôs software was effective enough to their business in the time they had it that it is worth these $5-15M+ contract renewals. Furthermore, these companies that are renewing already have underwent Palantir‚Äôs installation, and these clients will provide Palantir with the highest margins, which will reflect well on Palantir‚Äôs future financial reports.

¬∑ **New Partnerships/Contracts (and the expansion of commercial enterprise segment):** Every time that Palantir, or its partners release news that they have entered into a contract/agreement, this will help Palantir‚Äôs stock. This is because Palantir needs to keep expanding their software into new companies in order to meet their expected growth projections. Furthermore, as more commercial enterprises try Palantir‚Äôs software (and hopefully enjoy it), the more willing other companies might be to give Palantir a shot. I see their biggest potential for growth and to become a large company in their expansion of their commercial enterprise segment through Foundry. Every time Palantir gets more new clients on board it is fantastic and shows the feasibility of this segment, and as more contracts role in, more enterprises will take an interest. Furthermore, when Palantir signs these enterprises to a contract, it will help to increase their revenues, which will show up on their financial reports and hopefully help the, to beat estimates.

*This analysis took a long time, and is one of the most comprehensive that I have seen, so I would greatly appreciate if you followed me* [*here*](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/BeatingTheVTI?utm_source=R&utm_medium=B&utm_campaign=PLTR)*, and commented on my original post!*"

2021-07-01 14:09:12,wallstreetbets,"Palantir is a long term speculative buy and hold. 3 years is not long term, 5 years is not either. 10+ years, multiple business cycles, invest with money you aren‚Äôt expecting to need in this phase of your life.

2021-07-01 12:12:44,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for putting this together, I‚Äôm saving the thread to come back to in the future.

In reading this, it seems to me that the competitive advantage provided by PLTR‚Äôs software benefits early adopters the most, since it provides them with insights that may be invisible to competitors in their space. As their competitors sign on to the same software, that might minimize said advantage. That makes me wonder, will PLTR have multiple clients in one field? Or will a company sign a deal with PLTR on the condition that they get an exclusive partnership? In any case, it would be very interesting to get a list of companies that have signed significant deals with PLTR thus far. If one believes in the software enough to invest, then investing in some of these early adopting clients might also make sense. Anyone know of such a list?"

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Actual objective analysis on AMC Entertainment After hearing and seeing so much BS and one-sided opinions on AMC, thought I'd take a crack at some actual objective analysis on the company. 

Here's the crux of it:

What would you pay for AMC?

Well, a year ago, only 600m but what a difference a year makes as AMC is now trading at 29bn in market cap even though it has lost 3bn in income over the last 12mons as a result of the pandemic.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4kylpw8v2m871.png?width=1325&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a0387679e885ca0b3df26c443def82086fffc5f

You can make a case that AMC shouldn‚Äôt be valued based on backwards numbers as those were exceptional circumstances and at least in the near-term, their future is likely even brighter than pre-pandemic due to pent-up demand for a movie theater experience.

To keep it simple (my favourite principle), AMC was being valued at 2.1x enterprise value/trailing revenue pre-pandemic and assuming they have a blockbuster year this year that is 2x revenues versus pre-pandemic levels (ie., 10.6bn in revenues), even in that optimistic scenario they are trading at 3.7x enterprise value/forward revenue. Even if the average movie-goer goes 3x as often this next year as they‚Äôve done pre-pandemic because of a euphoric amount of pent-up demand, then AMC still trades at 2.5x enterprise value/forward revenue. While I promised to remain objective, I will subjectively add that when I ask myself if I‚Äôm going to watch 3x more movies this year, the answer as I look to my new big-screen TV is a quick no.

Clearly, valuation weighs more than just what will happen over the next year and if you think that the future for AMC will be brighter going forward then there could be a way to still justify valuation. I view the probability being higher that as demographics continue to age and alternatives like streaming become more attractive, theater traffic will continue to decline and that margins will continue to get squeezed. Yes, there are offsets like gaining market share but, in my experience, owning a larger piece of a declining pie is generally an area to avoid and certainly an area to avoid when valuation is a premium.

So, what would I pay for AMC? A reasonable value may be found by looking at AMC‚Äôs competitor, Cinemark, which is trading at 1.9x enterprise value/2019‚Äôs revenue. This valuation acknowledges a worsening of trends for movie theaters post-pandemic than pre-pandemic. This is a quarter of the valuation that AMC is trading at ‚Äì 7.4x enterprise value/2019‚Äôs revenue.

Does analysis matter at this point?

Probably not. If AMC can continue to dilute shareholders without consequence, then it would have limitless zero-cost capital to deploy and even a small return on this capital would make the company wealth creating as opposed to what it has been over time, wealth destroying."

Right now there‚Äôs a lot of idle money flooding into retail meme stocks, as pandemic eases this money will flow back into activities and less into stock. 

Until then this is a great speculators market if you‚Äôre willing to take the risks. Those who bought in at the pre teens are making good bank. Those buying in the 50-60 range less so. 

There‚Äôs a lot of foolish money chasing that one 10x options trade which is helping keep the price up. But even AMC have said this isn‚Äôt sustainable in the long run and they are just diluting to get capital as much as possible."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"An In Depth Look Into Peloton ‚Äì Why This Stock Is The Ultimate Long Term Becky Play   

**Positions**: 145 shares @ 91

**The Play**: Buy shares or ATM leap calls

&#x200B;

**Introduction**

Peloton was one of the key winners during the coronavirus pandemic and has seen a recent hit to its stock price as the world reopens and Wall Street starts to bet against the company as things ‚Äòreturn to normal.‚Äô In this DD, I would explain that Peloton is more than just a company that sells expensive workout equipment to stuck-at-home upper-middle-class housewives. Instead, it is more akin to a combination of a digital based subscription service and a fitness focused social media company. All of this, along with some external factors, once taken into account, will let Peloton carve out a key position in the broad fitness market even after Covid which in turn will translate into a higher stock price.  

&#x200B;

**Trend Towards Home Gyms**

Peloton was one of the companies that did exceptionally well during the pandemic as millions of Americans hunkered down and bought at-home fitness equipment. However, the mainstream mindset is that as things reopen and we transition ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù many of these Americans will return to their old habits of going back to physical gym locations and as a result, Peloton will see significant headwinds to future growth. I do not believe this will be the case. I believe that despite gyms reopening, recent trends point to a permanent change in consumer behavior that not enough Wall Street analysts are talking about. Let me explain. 

First off, despite gyms being reopened, studies have actually shown that a staggering 60% of adults enjoyed their at-home equipment so much, they do not plan on going back to physical gym locations ([link](https://www.glofox.com/blog/10-gym-membership-statistics-you-need-to-know/)). 

What‚Äôs more is that other studies have also pointed to a favorable environment going into 2021 for Peloton and other at-home fitness equipment manufacturers. On the website RunRepeat ([link](https://runrepeat.com/fitness-trends#fitness-trend-hit-the-hardest-in-2020-gym-memberships)), it states that the number one fitness trend of 2021 among active adults are outdoor activities such as running, cycling, walking, etc at 59.1%. This is higher than the 51.6% stated in 2020. This is followed by the number two trend which is at home fitness equipment at 16%, which is a lot higher than the 2020 consensus of 11.2%. Gyms on the other hand comes in much lower at 8.2% in 2021, a stark decrease from 20.8% in 2020. What this shows is that there is a permanent shift in consumer behavior. The idea of a monthly subscription access to a public gym appears to be coming to an end and consumers are more interested in either pursuing physical activities outside or investing into their own personal equipment. 

The website also stated additional information that helps the case for Peloton. It states that the fastest growing trend of 2021 is at home fitness equipment. In the US for example, the number of adults seeking at home equipment is up by a staggering 218%. What is more shocking is that the percentage of adults who see gyms as the best way to stay healthy is only 8.5%. This is a drastic decrease from the 20.4% we saw in 2020. 

In conclusion, even after the pandemic, Americans are now more invested than ever into at home work out equipment and are turning away in greater numbers from the traditional physical gym. As the manufacturer of one of the most recognized brands for at home fitness, Peloton is strategically placed to reap the rewards from this change in consumer behavior going into the near future. In addition, due to the recent launch of Peloton‚Äôs Digital membership application, the company can also benefit from the growth of outdoor activities as well. This I will explain in greater detail in the next section. 

&#x200B;

**The Economics of Peloton, Why Buying A $3,000 Bike Saves You Money:** 

At first glance it would appear that Peloton only targets really wealthy individuals, since only those with some serious scratch in their pockets can afford their flashy workout equipment. Just by going on their website, Peloton sells their exercise bikes starting at $2,495 for their standard Peloton Bike (https://www.onepeloton.ca/bike) and treadmills starting at $3,295 ([https://www.onepeloton.ca/tread](https://www.onepeloton.ca/tread)). This of course is on top of the monthly subscription fee of $49 if you decide to go with the All-Access Membership which is available to those with the Peloton Hardware and the Digital Membership plan of $16 a month which is available to anyone even those without any equipment ([https://www.onepeloton.ca/membership](https://www.onepeloton.ca/membership)). This option is tailored to those who prefer outdoor activities such as the ones listed in the prior section. It essentially creates a studio like atmosphere while users do their daily jog, bike outside, etc. This is the app I believe that will let Peloton capitalize on the growth of outdoor activities. 

To state the obvious, owning a Peloton is not cheap and it takes a special kind of person to fork over the staggering upfront cost plus the monthly subscription amount; however, that does not mean only wealthy individuals can find value within a $2,500 bicycle. Believe it or not, many people can actually SAVE money by buying a Peloton. Let me explain.  

The average cost of a boutique fitness class averages $35 per class in major cities throughout the US [https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fitness-classes-cost-expensive](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fitness-classes-cost-expensive). The average cost of a personal trainer can be between $40 - $70 an hour (https://lessons.com/costs/personal-trainer-cost). If you purchase a $2,500 Peloton, you pay $49 a month and have access to unlimited classes. Assuming you have two people who are fitness enthusiasts who attend classes twice a week, let‚Äôs compare how much they are going to spend on a yearly basis. Person #1 will not have the Peloton and will go to her spin class twice a week, the other, person #2 has a Peloton and forked over the upfront cost and monthly subscription. 

&#x200B;

||**Person 1**|**Person 2**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Peloton:  ||$2,500|
|Yearly Classes/Subscription Cost|$35 \*2 \*52|$588  or (49 \* 12)|
|Total Cost:   |$3,088|$2,988|

&#x200B;

This shows that just by assuming a person goes to a spin class twice a week, they can save around $600 in the first year by purchasing a Peloton. If that individual has a personal trainer, then the saving costs can be even larger. 

&#x200B;

**The Highly Addictive Atmosphere**

One unique aspect I keep hearing from Peloton users is how addictive the bikes are. Although the idea that working out and sweating can be addictive sounds absurd at face value, one look into the Peloton ecosystem can show us why that can be the case. 

When you read the testimonials and reviews of Peloton one thing that will often pop up is how engaging the classes are. The reviewers will often state that although they are working from home, the Peloton coaches, the music, and the overall environment of the classes make them feel like they are in a personal spin class or with a personal trainer one on one. Because of this, plus the social media aspects of the app such as competing against your fellow classmates make Peloton classes a highly addictive environment for many of its users. 

[link](https://www.worklifekids.com/blog/2018/11/22/i-hate-you-peloton)

To drive this point home from another angle that is not anecdotal, you can actually see the engagement percentage on peloton‚Äôs website. Right now the yearly engagement is around 94% yearly. This means that 94% of people who bought the Peloton bike still subscribes to the $49 monthly subscription 1 year after purchase. This is a big deal because Peloton does not make money selling bikes, they make money selling subscriptions as I will show you in the next section. 

&#x200B;

**A Look Into Their Financials**

When I analyze the financial statement of a company, I first focus on their balance sheet, income statement, then their cash flow. I also focus on convertible stocks, warrants, or any other investment vehicles that will let insiders or any other interested parties sell their shares and dilute shareholder value. 

*Balance Sheet*

Balance sheet is useful in getting a quick snapshot into the overall health of the company. Here I will look at their working capital to confirm that the company is indeed solvent. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qvqzvbhczl871.png?width=1889&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3855a28fda017b37e23811abf3e4ae470d8d408

Net working capital is the sum of current assets minus current liabilities. Since current assets outweigh current liabilities, the company‚Äôs solvency is not an issue. Total assets outweigh total liabilities as well so the longevity of the company will not come into question. 

*Income Statement*

For the income statement, three interesting things points out. First, is that the lion‚Äôs share of company revenue comes from sale of fitness equipment and no the application subscription. This is not surprising but it confirms where top line revenue growth is coming from. The second point of interest is that in the operating expenses section the company invests heavily into marketing and R&D. R&D tripled compared to this time last year which means the company will most likely increase their product lines. SGA remains relatively steady which shows the company‚Äôs management runs a tight ship and knows how to trim the fat around excess spending. This is a good sign especially for a growing tech company and it shows in their positive net income for the 9 months ended period in the third column. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/szp7yz7ezl871.png?width=1893&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1e0318008cbebf51166911a67045cc6ff6f876d

Another point of interest about their income statement is that even though subscription revenue accounts for about 16% of total revenue, it accounts for about 34% of gross profit. What this means is that Peloton does not make money selling the bikes, they make money via their subscription fees. The bikes are more so a tool to hook people in to the Peloton ecosystem where the real margins are made.

 

https://preview.redd.it/lsi147ngzl871.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a83048fd953b02485ccf7caea537d63f7f7f134

*Cash Flow*

Cash flow statements are broken into three sections: Operating, Investing, and Financing. 

Operating cash flow is useful for assessing the quality of the company‚Äôs earnings. If a company posts positive EPS, they should also post positive operating cash flow as well. 

Over here you can see the company is operating cash flow positive which is really good because it shows high earnings quality as well as the company‚Äôs ability to bring in cash to the business. This means the operations are actually viable and decreases the chance for future share and debt issuance which will erode current shareholder value. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gb4m5hgizl871.png?width=1896&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d7603bd672735c2d7698f38f8b21b53bddd757f

Investing cash flow is useful to assess where the company is investing their money and it gives good indication on where the management wants to take the company. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4mkw58hjzl871.png?width=1902&format=png&auto=webp&s=81b7a632577caefa4769fa72656e7702cfe9089f

What stands out to me the most in this section is the first line-purchases of marketable securities of -$450m. What this means is that this company is buying back $450m of their own shares per quarter which is really good because it increases the value of your stock holdings and elevates share price. This is a practice that is mostly attributed to blue chip companies so a growth stock like Peloton buying back shares is really impressive. What also stands out is that company increased their investment into PPE which shows that they are also invested into future growth which will really help long term potential. 

Financing cash flow is useful to see if the company is taking on too much debt relative to earnings and if the company is either financing their operations through debt or equity issuance. This section is important as a shareholder because it helps assess the value of your potential investment into the company. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ukit8zjkzl871.png?width=1895&format=png&auto=webp&s=05d00b45d506f74708e0b928ba677cdcac6c53d5

Over here you will see that this quarter the company did not issue out any convertible debt. This is a plus for current shareholders because it will help decrease the risk for future share dilution. This combined with their steady share buyback will help create a really positive outlook for this stock."

# Commercial Metals Company ($CMC)

**Background**

Commercial Metals Company manufactures, recycles, and fabricates steel and metal products utilizing electric arc furnace (""EAF"") mini mills, EAF micro mills, rerolling mills, steel fabrication and processing plants, construction-related product warehouses, and metal recycling facilities in the U.S. and Poland.

\---------

**Fundamentals and Recent Accomplishments/Developments:**

THEY JUST KEEP BEATING EARNINGS. They have also been increasing over the past 3 quarters. Despite this, it seems the market hasn't reacted and the price of CMC has been trading relatively flat to down since the latest blowout earnings.

https://preview.redd.it/zg5e1cbiul871.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=870798f74dfc181c9648d068b8ef62ce27b4934b

P/E=11.29 (low relative to DIA which is between 19.8 and 22.6)

Debt/Eq = 0.5 (very very low, stable company)

https://preview.redd.it/ye25uv9kul871.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=df10d49333babe3df16a9ca8e9073f348e051a29

CMC leads in the markets that they are in.

https://preview.redd.it/ue809xzlul871.png?width=421&format=png&auto=webp&s=477997a77a00668f510b07a9dd7fedd048772b15

The following info is from the 2021 3rd quarter earnings presentation here:

[Link 1](https://www.cmc.com/getmedia/d9f980ac-ee36-422a-81b0-8ca55775725f/Q3-FY-2021-Supplemental-Deck.pdf)

And report:

[Link 2](https://d2ghdaxqb194v2.cloudfront.net/653/184158.pdf)

EBITDA has grown significantly over the past year. Up 49% year-over-year and 35% sequentially; and record North America and Europe segment Adjusted EBITDA.

https://preview.redd.it/hjcw92loul871.png?width=455&format=png&auto=webp&s=1100189a809034c8c8d9d13f75f41aa39f6176f9

Additionally, this is CMC‚Äôs seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year reduction in North America controllable costs per ton. And 7 is a super lucky number too.

Continued growth is expected to be fueled by the commissioning of a third Polish rolling line and receipt of air permit for Arizona 2 project. The Arizona 2 micormill will be the first micromill in the world to produce merchant bar and rebar.

https://preview.redd.it/4ly13rdwul871.png?width=507&format=png&auto=webp&s=68cb603178c35069cc6def18eec05e6fb84c4ace

Slight bummer here. Margin over scrap cost on downstream products declined compared to a year ago, driven by higher scrap input costs and average pricing that was largely unchanged. 

On the flip side, margins over scrap cost on steel products increased $40 per ton from the prior year period, marking the first year-over-year increase in six quarters. On a sequential basis these margins rose $74 per ton. This trend is expected to continue until mid 2022 with elevated pricing into 2023.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/meh6vjn5vl871.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=034f94b5b3848e9ecb76e3ae24eeff0276b5a2df

Margin and EBITDA in Europe have exploded this last quarter. The improvement was driven by a significant expansion in margin over scrap as well as volume growth, as demand for steel products from both construction and industrial end markets remained strong during the quarter.

Resilient construction activity supported a 16% increase in rebar shipments compared to a year ago, while the continuing manufacturing recovery in Poland and Central Europe drove 4% growth in volumes of merchant and other. Average selling price increased by $227 per ton compared to the prior year quarter, and $132 per ton sequentially.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/03cpsmv9vl871.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c73ad2c2141787922a6d9fd0e45b4ab24d01238

This type of cash flow allows CMC to fund projects utilizing ‚Äúorganic cash generation‚Äù. I take this to mean that the company won‚Äôt be selling stock.

\-------------

# Outlook

CMC is anticipating that the strong demand expressed by the sector should support robust shipment levels of finished steel during the fourth quarter in both North America and Europe. Construction activity is strong and the industrial sectors are growing in both the U.S. and Central Europe, as both regions continue to recover from the pandemic.

CMC also expects 4th quarter margins over scrap on steel products in North America and Europe to be up modestly from third quarter levels (3rd quarter margins already up $74 per ton sequentially in North America, up $84 in Europe).

CMC‚Äôs stability of in their construction backlog and willingness of downstream customers in North America to contract new work point to continued demand strength. The CEO stated that ‚ÄúThis view is supported by several widely monitored construction indicators that generally lead activity by nine to twelve months, which have improved significantly in 2021,‚Äù.

\-------------

**Biden Infrastructure Plan**

On June 24th President Joe Biden declared ‚Äúwe have a deal‚Äù on a major infrastructure initiative after meeting with a bipartisan group of senators. The deal will pump $1.2 trillion into roads, bridges, tunnels and broadband. These are the markets that CMC services primarily (minus broadband).

Biden has delinked the infrastructure bill from some additional Democratic plans. This move gained support from Republicans and has increased the likelihood that the infrastructure bill will pass.

Once passed, CMC could benefit greatly from government contracts.

# Technical Analysis:

[Bottom of a rising channel. Price target $37. Could also be a double bottom if it hits 30 again which would be really bullish.](https://preview.redd.it/92wonofdvl871.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=6be1b78516dbcfde680cc993cad34e434332b4c2)

&#x200B;

[Momentum is picking up on this stock. The trajectory looks good. In my opinion, it's fairly likely that CMC will start to outpace the SPX in the next few weeks.](https://preview.redd.it/x8lxd7zwvl871.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab778ce537b52c49bd27b4a47615d44cb949307c)

\--------------

# Why I think the stock is good:

Very simple (and similar to $TX), the company has no debt. They produce something that everyone needs. That thing is steel. Steel costs a lot of money and will continue to into the foreseeable future.

The CME group bumped hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel futures to over $1000 out till Jan 2023 (previously Dec 2022). HRC futures for the near-term months are continuing to climb above $1800, and my personal conversations with Civil Engineers indicate that clients are still begging to build new structures regardless of the material costs.

CMC doesn‚Äôt produce HRC, however I THINK the price of rebar (and steel in general) tends to track with the price of HRC.

&#x200B;

Also, I really am starting to believe that some semblance of an infrastructure bill will get pushed through.

Downside: CMC doesn‚Äôt service the US automotive industry and shouldn‚Äôt see much benefits from the easing of the semiconductor shortage.

Thanks for reading.

2021-07-01 09:55:25,wallstreetbets,Should do well. Also worth looking into alternative rebar solutions especially matter Florida is Basa.

2021-07-01 11:29:46,wallstreetbets,My rebar is full
2021-07-01 10:52:36,wallstreetbets,"FYI, rumors are circulating about China implementing an export tax on steel, among many other materials. 

If this happens, steel producers outside of China will benefit greatly. Over the last weekish, Chinese steel mills have suspended committing to future contracts, and related industrial stocks in Taiwan have dramatically increased because industry leaders are certain about a tax happening. Rumors indicate tomorrow or shortly thereafter, suggesting the possibility of a decent short-term play; ie buy something that won't lose much value over 3 days, sell on no news EOD Friday or early next week. 


>According to the article, it is ‚Äúlikely for China to announce the export tax on or right after July 1st, which is CCP‚Äôs 100th anniversary celebration. ‚Äú

>‚ÄúBoth China and Russia are essentially forced to roll out series of policies to combat domestic commodity price hikes.‚Äù

>In addition, according to the article, if and when that happens, Chinese steel will ‚Äúvanish‚Äù from the global market.

>‚ÄúThe steel shortage will be worse than the chip shortage we have seen. All the manufacturers will be scrambling to secure supply and capacity‚Äù

>Hope it helps, oh and all the steel stocks on Taiwanese stock exchange went to the moon over the last 5 days.


Also HRC futures are once again reaching all time highs and climbing, even relative to last time you heard this statement."

2021-07-01 16:34:11,wallstreetbets,What kind of grief are the rebar manufacturers going to get after the collapse in Florida. There‚Äôs already a big push to ban epoxy costed rebar in the US just like they did in Canada.

He is refusing to give me a timeline other than ill make it as soon as possible but probably at least months. This news would only make steel more expensive"
2021-07-01 10:28:29,wallstreetbets,Very unlikely but gosh dang it Im in
2021-07-01 17:29:04,wallstreetbets,"Idk, but I have a feeling the collapse isn‚Äôt solely the fault of the type of rebar. I‚Äôd venture to say there were some serious design flaws or very very poor maintenance."
2021-07-01 10:47:53,wallstreetbets,"Incredibly underrated play, this should be trading in the \~$35 range"
2021-07-01 17:58:46,wallstreetbets,"Except he buys the entire company. And usually between 10-25% or his entire net worth, (5-15% of Berkshire total holdings)

2021-07-01 13:17:22,wallstreetbets,"Correct, with the additional upside that it removes the fear of China flooding the market with cheap steel. I'm betting substantially that this will be the catalyst to cause institutional buy-in to the industry."
2021-07-01 11:09:51,wallstreetbets,Very likely sir! I am up 35% already üöÄ
2021-07-01 11:15:23,wallstreetbets,Yea but steel brother clf is also the play!

If you've been trading for ANY amount of time and watched how Friday's go for trades like this then prepare for max pain unless you have another half a mil to fight back and get lucky with retail help. If not then you just gave away your lambo money. 150k was plenty for a super clean low mileage used one.

Hopefully you have a broker with an instant exercise button to exercise intraday. If it's any bullshit broker like webull where you have to email them or something similar you are fucked. It will never close above 12."

2021-07-01 17:14:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah that shit went nowhere for like 5 years. I got after one year. Never again
2021-07-01 15:36:02,wallstreetbets,Of course not. I'm just going by recent price activity and taking into account the run up was likely caused by the HUGE influx of retail traders in January of which the majority took their profits and are long gone. A few returned with the recent non stop articles but I don't expect them to stick around with no price movement. The future is electric not scooping cow shit.
2021-07-01 15:39:39,wallstreetbets,I don't short anything.
2021-07-01 15:56:11,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm going by fundamentals. The stock is trading just around 8x it‚Äôs sales. It‚Äôs got strong tailwinds with the whole carbon neutrality. And as it stands rng is carbon negative. These are my long term objectives.  

  Also in the short term and catalyst will explode the stock. Any infrastructure deal/ new partnership etc will triple the stock. So I don‚Äôt want to miss out on those good days as well. So there you have it."
2021-07-01 16:27:55,wallstreetbets,You are obviously free to think what you want and stick to your convictions but carbon neutral is seen as no different than carbon credits. The goal is zero carbon emissions and they already have a proven solution with electric cars which are starting to outperform ICE cars. It's great that they are trying to use the already released carbon but it's still just lowering it when we already have a zero carbon solution in that sector. What we need for livestock and landfills are low cost large scale carbon scrubbers like they use in space. They have a worse solution to an already solved problem by using it as fuel.
2021-07-01 17:26:40,wallstreetbets,"Bro. I wish you good luck on your short position. 

However let‚Äôs go back to your comment. You are fundamentally very wrong about carbon. As it stands now, any carbon reduction would be a step in the right direction. Ice aren‚Äôt going to disappear. Ev‚Äôs already receive tremendous tax credits which incentivized them by a lot. I think there is enough cake for everyone in this space and not all of it goes to Tesla."

2021-07-01 10:57:18,wallstreetbets,"XLNX dumps if china block since AMD paid huge premium to acquire it. 

My concern is China block this if US/UK blocks ARM/NVDA. 

From China's perspective, they have no reason absent external factors to block AMD/Xilinx. 

Still not a bad arbitrage play to buy Xilinx though. I just prefer to hold AMD to ensure gains are locked in without relying on a merger to get approved."
2021-07-01 10:37:11,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain this in simpler terms?
2021-07-01 14:08:13,wallstreetbets,"If the deal is blocked XLNX will tank heavily in the short term while AMD is likely to remain almost untouched. That‚Äôs why the premium is there.

Source of the problem is the Same reason why BABA, BIDU or JD have significantly lower valuations than the US equivalents. Unpredictability of China increases the risks."
2021-07-01 09:59:13,wallstreetbets,when is the conversion happening?
2021-07-01 10:34:35,wallstreetbets,5G? I thought they made FPGA chips
2021-07-01 11:37:38,wallstreetbets,"agree, dont fuck around, and just hold amd. but why would china care if arm/nvda is blocked? they havent even approved the arm/nvda deal themselves."
2021-07-01 11:39:04,wallstreetbets,"AMD shareholders have agreed to acquire XLNX. Instead of paying with cash, they are acquiring the company entirely through stock. The two parties have agreed to a fixed ratio of 1:1.72 to do so. Meaning for every one share of XLNX owned you will receive 1.72 ish shares of AMD. Only if all necessary regulatory bodies approve the acquisition. Currently China is the last approval required until the merger can occur. Technically China can say no and AMD will most likely decide to not go on with the merger.

Because the acquisition is a fixed rate of shares. OP is staring at current market prices the value of one share of XLNX currently is cheaper than 1.72 shares of AMD creating a small discount. So if you were to buy XLNX in an attempt to buy AMD at a cheaper rate it could or could not possibly work out. It‚Äôs not a guaranteed thing."
2021-07-01 11:02:43,wallstreetbets,"AMD is buying XLNX when it goes through XLNX will be worth more, so buy them before the merger is finalised by China

Edit: that was me paraphrasing what he‚Äôs saying not me telling you what to do btw"
2021-07-01 11:08:11,wallstreetbets,"No one is sure, UK and EU approval is already done, possible catalyst for this previous run. Next is waiting for China to approve, their review process is stricter and takes longer because the Chinese government is the Chinese government. I read an article somewhere that it takes them anywhere from 6-12 months to make a decision, I can‚Äôt remember when the merger was initiated but I think we still have 0-6 months to go IIRC."
2021-07-01 11:34:56,wallstreetbets,go to r/amd_stock and click on the catalyst timeline post. has lots of good info on the merger logistics.
2021-07-01 11:36:37,wallstreetbets,"FPGA is just the building blocks for many solutions xilinx (now amd) can offer.

2021-07-01 11:45:39,wallstreetbets,"China is concerned it is being frozen out of cutting edge tech because it is by US sanctions. 

China in no way wants ARM, which is UK based and currently neutral to be owned by NVDA (US based). It wants to ensure equal access for its companies to ARM. 

I cant see US/UK/EU approving the NVDA/ARM deal irrespective of what ARM purchasers say. Makes no sense to create such a strong market position for NVDA. 

China will go last on NVDA/ARM anyway as it always likes to do. 

China doesnt really care about competition. What it wants is tech. Cynically the ability to easily steal IP and catch up."
2021-07-01 12:33:51,wallstreetbets,"Ah ya skyworks is the 5G player, makes sense now"
2021-07-01 11:51:05,wallstreetbets,i am dumb... please explain.... youre saying that china does not want arm to be bought by nvda (i agree). but they will block the amd/xilinx if us/uk blocks arm deal? isnt that what they want though?
2021-07-01 12:02:07,wallstreetbets,"you right, i am dumb. should have said approves instead of block re ""if US/UK blocks ARM/NVDA"""
2021-07-01 17:38:21,wallstreetbets,"I still don't see what china blocking amd/xilinx would change if uk approve arm/nvda, xilinx and amd are already both US based and china can just block arm itself if it really wants to.."
2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My High-Conviction Bet on Paysafe (PSFE) Posting here to offer a little perspective on what some apes saw as a quick hype play.

It was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week after months of daily short attacks.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F‚Äôs showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.

That‚Äôs all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long-term.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER‚Äôs come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it‚Äôs no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.

The comprehensive DD below is for the diamond handed apes who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you‚Äôre not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer called Paysafe, ‚Äúthe ultimate stock for this moment‚Äù and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to ‚Äú$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.‚Äù  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.

But informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo‚Äôs several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it‚Äôs worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)

With a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they‚Äôve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:

&#x200B;

* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is ‚Äúupwards of 7-10 years‚Äù ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, ‚ÄúThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents‚Äô age,‚Äù adding that the private equity firms ‚Äúhave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.‚Äù ^(5)
* Under Blackstone/CVC‚Äôs stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the ‚Äúmid to high teens.‚Äù  But even if you include 2020‚Äôs stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal‚Äôs current projected growth. ^(6,7)
* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.
* Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe‚Äôs strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that‚Äôs and ‚Äúm‚Äù and a ‚Äúb‚Äù.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That‚Äôs a 36x return.  He says  ‚ÄúThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.‚Äù ^(6,9)

**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**

* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe‚Äôs already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don‚Äôt include growth from their ""active M&A pipeline"" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).
* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: ‚ÄúResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.""
* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.
* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody‚Äôs credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: ‚ÄúOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe‚Äôs leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.‚Äù  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.
* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.
* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.

**Highly competitve**

* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion ‚Äúunbanked‚Äù globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just yesterday, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.
* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar‚Äôs, and Pointsbet among many others.
* \#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe‚Äôs proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted ‚ÄúBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution‚Äù, ‚ÄúPayment Processor of the Year,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest Payment Method.‚Äù
* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted ‚ÄúBest Digital Wallet‚Äù for ‚Äúbest consumer take up‚Äù, ‚Äúmost innovative technology‚Äù with ‚Äúgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.‚Äù
* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn‚Äôt meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe‚Äôs digital wallet Skrill as ‚Äúgreat‚Äù (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)
   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as ‚ÄúAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as ‚Äúbad‚Äù (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as ‚Äúbad‚Äù (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)

**‚ÄúAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.""** \- Bill Foley

&#x200B;

* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe‚Äôs advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don‚Äôt realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.
* Bill Foley says, ""It‚Äôs going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else‚Ä¶we‚Äôre seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that‚Äôs headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We‚Äôve got a wide landscape we can attack. It‚Äôs pretty exciting‚Äù
* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, ‚ÄúWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.‚Äù
* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, ‚ÄúPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,‚Äù adding, ‚Äúwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.‚Äù ^(13)
   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:
      * ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering""
      * ""Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature""
      * ‚ÄúNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign""

&#x200B;

* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a ""Buy"". A few quotes :
   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: ‚ÄúWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized & complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.‚Äù ‚Äúrecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE‚Äôs business and the FTAC II transaction‚Äù and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: ‚ÄúPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online & in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet & eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it‚Äôs this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.‚Äù ^(14)
   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: ‚ÄúPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE‚Äôs revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.‚Äù iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow ‚Äúat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world‚Äù with a ""5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%."" ^(15)
   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its ‚Äúrobust risk management operation,‚Äù and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)

&#x200B;

**MOAT:**  **‚Äúrobust risk management operation‚Äù**

So why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?

Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : ‚ÄúWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it‚Äôs hard to copy.‚Ä¶We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It‚Äôs a real strength of ours. We‚Äôve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we‚Äôve upgraded the team, we‚Äôve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players‚Ä¶we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can‚Äôt do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we‚Äôre not only talking about take rates and comps, we‚Äôre talking about revenue-generation, we‚Äôre talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That‚Äôs a really, really powerful position to have.‚Äù ^(9)

&#x200B;

**Valuation:**

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.

* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),
* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.
* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.
* The group's collective growth rate of \~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their ""active M&A pipeline.""  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.
* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:

Paysafe‚Äôs share price with average of sector peer multiples:

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09
* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91
* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

More realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100

* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**
* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**
* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**

**Average : $46.52**

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe‚Äôs conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for ""$45/55"" may actually be quite reasonable.

2021-07-01 18:04:27,wallstreetbets,"I've been long on this well before the recent dumps & WSB hype. 

What I consider to be very well their advantage is that they are willing to pick up the scraps that other companies won't. Ofc this comes with additional risk as they operate in areas where bad PR and news can really affect volatility. 

I think that if you're not faint-hearted and have a longer term investing horizon and goals this will pay off handsomely. 

This is good DD but retards beware don't go yolo'ing on this one. The odds are against you in this casino, if you wanna play it smart go long, buy leaps if your wife's boyfriend has cut down on your weekly allowance and can't afford shares."

2021-07-01 12:04:34,wallstreetbets,"I worked sales in payments for four years. A large international payments company. Direct competitor to Paysafe in all respects except we were more restrained on gambling.

Paysafe make money, in large part, by charging merchants for a fee per card transaction. This is known as merchant acquiring. (Yes, the term ""acquiring"" is a little odd here, but keep following)

This fee is subject to many variables, including interchange fees charged to Paysafe by the card scheme (Visa/MC), as well as competition. Acquirers historically were subsidaries of banks - Chase Paymentech are examples of one that still is - JPM, in this case.

 As fees are usually taken before income is paid to the merchant (else invoiced payable within 30 days), it means bank-linked acquirers can significantly reduce their txn fee (and thus increase the topline) for merchants as an incentive they want to upsell more profitable products like loans to. I have worked in the industry and seen it time and again. One large international merchant even got free acquiring, they were that good a customer of the bank's other services. I even worked personally in combo with a bank on a deal of such a type.

Whilst I appreciate that gambling companies are higher risk and some acquirers won't touch them...the barrier to entry is just the acquiring price and the willingness of a competitor to pant-drop. And they do.

Plus I interviewed at Paysafe once. UK office, pre-Covid. There wasn't any buzz, any excitement. It seemes boring and uninspired. Granted, its a subsidary office.

I hold no position on this stock and I am not planning to. Nor am I looking to shit all over the stock per se. Just cautious advice from personal experience."

2021-07-01 12:21:39,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your input. This investment isn't so much about corporate culture or even competitors as Paysafe has shown it can hold its own in specific verticals. Bill Foley's long background is in turning around financial services companies and he's specifically said he loves ""boring companies.""  More than cleaning up a balance sheet for profitability, this play is about synergy through M&A and Foley's active dealmaking in betting, cashless casinos along with connecting the Paysafe platform with his many other companies. Something Bloomberg has referred to as the ""Foley Network.""

Caution is always warranted but I've been following this long enough to feel very comfortable about the limited downside risk. Cheers!"

&#x200B;

SeekingAlpha - I like this the best, although I know others have mixed feelings. It gives me great info on my portfolio and alerts me of any news related to my securities. BUT, you can only read a few articles per month before it requires you to pay for a subscription 

&#x200B;

FinWiz - great for market analysis 

&#x200B;

MarketWatch - ehhh, it's okay. A lot of digging through irrelevant news to find articles I actually care about IMO 

&#x200B;

Bloomberg - just downloaded, haven't used it much yet 

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts on these and what other apps would you recommend for latest news / market data?"

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Will Cathie Wood buy DIDI? She slammed Uber and Lyft for not taking advantage of tracking routes for AI. She talks up Tesla for future  ride share because they track data. Know she believes in Tesla auto rides for future but think DIDI is a good investment here because they likely do track given that they are already working on autonomous ride share and China tracks everything. DIDI ties to USA (research company for autonomous ride share based in CA) make this less risky. Too much bug US and China $ behind this for China to implode it. Trade relationship will improve. Maybe there is a future partnership with Tesla and DIDI on the horizon or maybe it is just a good investment at $15-$16 range given where Lyft and Uber are trading. No way DIDI is not $20+ by Q4.

2021-07-01 10:05:50,wallstreetbets,Uber owns 15% of Didi so...
2021-07-01 15:39:22,wallstreetbets,I got in yesterday at close $14.35 will buy more under 15

2021-07-01 09:26:16,wallstreetbets,"Last time I was in cdmx, it was about even. Didi was brand new. Price was the same at the end of the ride.

Good to see that they improved. I like the CEO and general direction."
2021-07-01 17:28:17,wallstreetbets,Didi is subsidizing rides right now by a huge amount in latam of course they are used more. Watch what happens now that they have to report earnings
2021-07-01 11:49:14,wallstreetbets,they also big in Australia and Japan. they are not operate in the US so people dont know them.....
2021-07-01 09:16:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I have done well following her moves"
2021-07-01 09:01:51,wallstreetbets,Yes. Price action reflects this
2021-07-01 09:24:19,wallstreetbets,Obviously they do since she moves the SP
2021-07-01 11:48:09,wallstreetbets,Yes. Big time.
2021-07-01 12:47:14,wallstreetbets,So they should get bought by a lot of index funds then?
2021-07-01 17:31:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah after they got fucked out of china by the CCP like every other business. Didi still had to give up 15% to make it happen what a joke of a company
2021-07-01 10:15:40,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm in Merida.   

2 years ago, Uber was dominant here.  

But, I think their predatory approach during COVID turned off a lot of drivers and restaurants.   Now, Uber is essentially dead here.

DiDi always has drivers/relationships with the best places for food delivery, etc.  And for rides, they are 15-20% less than Uber.  

I‚Äôm not sure if the particular mechanics of why they are more friendly to ppl on the service side, but it‚Äôs super clear they are the lead horse."
2021-07-01 18:15:33,wallstreetbets,"They will report weak earnings but strong growth. 

Just as when Netflix had negative earnings when they had to gain viewership and license movies before they started producing Netflix originals.

Or when Amazon did in order to gain market share in eCommerce."
2021-07-01 12:48:17,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt see them ever operating in the US. The political side of things will always be too big to overcome.
2021-07-01 10:21:25,wallstreetbets,"CEO seems to care about drivers. Her dad was a taxi driver. 

Striking contrast to Uber. Predatory is a good word to describe Uber."

2021-07-01 09:34:34,wallstreetbets,"AMD is greatly underpriced. AMD Revenue/Profit can surpass NVDA levels within 1-1.5 years as AMD is jumping 50+% revenue a year. That isn't slowing down any time soon...chips are short everywhere and the demand for chips will keep growing. Revenue might even be larger than 50% growth in 2022 and 2023 because AMD has been held back by the chip shortage... TSCM and Samsung are building huge chip fabs here in US, AMD will be a top customer of both. The product pipeline of AMD is insanely strong. Consoles, Data Center, Automobile, Mobile Phone, Computing and Gaming, AI etc. By 2023, AMD should be easily over $200 in share price. If it gets the same as NVDA P/E ...it will be $250-300+..."

\- Tesla partnership with Model S plaid

\- Xbox + PS5 refresh

\- EPYC Milan + Intel's Sapphire Rapid Delays 

\- EVGA (huge partner of INTC and Nvidia) - producing Motherboards for AMD

\- AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) - released as competition to Nvidia's raytracing

All this POSITIVE news points to the upside. Nvidia's market cap is \~5x AMDs but their revenues are not even 2x AMD. 3D stacking technology releasing next year can potentially bring performance of their GPUs to be on par or beat Nvidia's offerings."

2021-07-01 19:36:31,wallstreetbets,"I don't believe the ARM deal has been cleared by regulators yet. It's still possible the U.K. would stop the sale of ""essential technology"" last I heard. Nvidia is kicking AMDs ass in GPUs at the moment, but AMD has been owning server CPU markets for years at this point. Also Apple's hype factory bullshit about their ARM M1 chips isn't very trustable. Simply put, ARM scales down well, but not up. Meanwhile x86 scales up very well, but it doesn't scale down to ARM level low power devices. Hence Apple is always comparing to ultrabook chips in their benchmarks, that and not comparing the M1 to Ryzen chips."
2021-07-01 12:55:06,wallstreetbets,"just googled it, looks like they did finish the acquisition of ARM last year, which I see as kind of a desperate play to diversify into the CPU market. My confidence in AMD's homegrown CPU division is much higher, especially considering what they have accomplished with a lower budget recently. I am going to have to assume that they will continue to widen the IP gap between themselves and their competitors - what else am I going to do? Bet that everyone has fun and a good time? They are my pick.

2021-07-01 11:20:05,wallstreetbets,AMD is at 35-40 P/E with enormous growth numbers. This is not a wild multiple in today's market. Look at these other Tech unicorns and meme stocks that can't even turn a profit.
2021-07-01 10:00:29,wallstreetbets,"You say that while being possibly unaware that the shortage hasn't stopped NVDA from pumping into the stratosphere recently. If NVDA can soar that high during the shortage, AMD can progress towards fair value at 120+ as well."
2021-07-01 10:00:59,wallstreetbets,I'm not saying it will be solved. Even easing a little will help AMD. AMD showed massive numbers 50%+ Y/Y with a horrible shortage.
2021-07-01 13:14:39,wallstreetbets,"Ehhhh 

I wouldn't go that far. Different use cases. Apple make chips for *their* devices (and haven't migrated to it yet, in any reasonable sense). Samsung make chips for *other clients* ... but aren't competing with AMD. Google AFAIK only makes proprietary chips for their internal data farms for security reasons... 

AMD has a lot of consumer and big data clients to serve. ""Chip shortages"" aren't really effecting that type of silicon, it's going to hurt EVs, Smart Phones and other devices which use small chips (such as Graphics cards, which does effect AMD... but not a lot).

AMD's supply suffered primarily from the pandemic and winding-down of facilities. You could buy a Ryzen chip the whole time without being scalped. You ***still*** cannot buy an NVidia 3090 unless you pay an extreme premium on it."

x86 is basically limited by decisions made in the 70s, and ARM is 90s technology. Also big players like Google are getting cucked by AMD and Intel at the moment and they're investing in RISC-V to be more vendor independent. Then there are things like European Processor Initiative which are based on RISC-V.

2021-07-01 18:44:28,wallstreetbets,There're like 10m subs on this trainwreck and the post volume's lower than B.Clinton's pants at his desk. It's plenty silent but deadly in here already.
2021-07-01 18:18:19,wallstreetbets,"NVDA is investing in task-specific designs. The market for silicon is huge and there's demand for all shorts of different things. I'm extremely bullish on both AMD and NVDA don't get me wrong, I still think that even in the datacenter space where both might be competing for silicon they can both do fine. 

NVDA will probably overtake the market for training nodes (have you heard many people training in OpenCL? CUDA is the way to go!) but for general tasks the power efficiency of Epic chips and the lower price tag is very alluring.

They're both after Intel's lunch really. The risk here being how well companies trying to push for their own designs / architectures will do (Apple's M1 series, Google's, Amazon's and BABA's proprietary designs etc.). 

Apart from those don't forget there's also a huge market for embeded, integrated and edge computing as well. I'm not a huge fan of AMD's Xilinx acquisition as we've seen that the use cases for FPGAs are very niche. QCOM most certainly is balls deep in this space, but there is growing interest from NVDA and AMD too!"
2021-07-01 10:36:11,wallstreetbets,"yeah,  maybe"
2021-07-01 13:26:19,wallstreetbets,I would have certainly bought NVDA if I had gotten the timing right. AMDs value at 75 a share was unreal a few months ago. I can‚Äôt drop 400+ for nvda which I don‚Äôt see having the same potential. The nvda value is realized by the market amd was certainly not at 75

> In any case, AMD is more of a growth stock than it is a traditional semi stock.

Of course it is. I'm just saying that with the high multiples of AMD and Nvidia, any slow in growth will be a big hit to their stock price. Both companies have some industry risk. I didn't say their valuations weren't deserved based on the growth - I'm saying that with growth valuations that high, they have to keep up the torrid pace for the share price to stay this high."
2021-07-01 11:45:01,wallstreetbets,This is literally the only long term stock I am heavily invested in. I do not pay attention to daily jumps as I am confident their long term strategy. I had calls and puts on both PLAY and SOFI for my weekly fuck around meme stocks

Holders on the 8th July will collect almost 2% (7.2% in the next 12 months) . Dividend will be lowered from 2H22 to approx. 5% (still above Verizon) and investors will get rewarded with 71% of NewCo (Warner Media+ Discovery) which is worth $12/share ($90bn). T stub is worth $24/25. Transaction will create $7/8 value (current Warner implied value is 7x ebitda vs min 12x as a stand alone media). 2. Good wireless ads momentum continues in Q2 driven by solid execution (marketing, simplified post paid plans etc) and strong numbers from Warner as the economy reopens post Pandemic. Bottom line: dividend and results n/t catalyst and m/t more clarity on the Warner Media transaction with analysts updating models and increasing numbers"

2021-07-01 06:30:15,wallstreetbets,"For those who don't know what the AMD play is - there is an AMD merger that appears to be closed pending sign off later in the year.

You'd be literally retarded (and not in a cute memey way) if you weren't buying right now but you'll be holding it for a minute before it actually pops off. Too early to tell how fast the money will move, could be volatile run up to the announcement and you may catch a dip closer to the time or the rocket may leave you behind early doors."

Find the rules, or ‚Äúlaws,‚Äù connecting the two prices.
The book I was reading did not analyze warrants scientifically.

2021-07-01 13:46:38,wallstreetbets,The beatings will continue until morale improves.
2021-07-01 13:48:36,wallstreetbets,I think it's time to do 3rd true stock so that new apes can buy in low. Not a lot of people who have no shares of GME and AMC are going to want to enter at the current price because it's pretty risky if it falls off from paperhands

2021-07-01 15:08:05,wallstreetbets,Jan 2022 $50 leaps are essentially the same thing and way less risk
2021-07-01 15:24:29,wallstreetbets,Big risk is who the fuck is going to be trading day before extended weekend.  I'm expecting low energy dog shit volume tomorrow.  And low volume rarely moves the needle upwards. 7/16 is a safer bet and honestly 8/20 would be the best play as you can play the hype up to earnings (and possibly hold through if you're feeling spicy)
2021-07-01 13:06:50,wallstreetbets,That is the way

2021-07-01 12:53:51,wallstreetbets,You shouldn‚Äôt be in calls for amc. After this big run up you want to wait for IV to die plus a big drop otherwise holding shares is the way

2021-07-01 06:28:25,wallstreetbets,Get your calls for august or later. $100c for 8/20 are pretty juicy and a safe bet although premium has gone up significantly in the past couple days. Merger approval should be by the end of the month for UK and EU but chinas regulatory approval could take way longer.

Stock goes red : panic, bite your nails hoping for it to climb. Check your trading platform 2020302235 times a day.

Get stressed, go to WSB for relief comedy and unintentional gambling intervention.

Find that one post where someone made 300k+ today.

Get upset that it wasn't you.

2021-07-01 09:32:58,wallstreetbets,"In the very long term, all that matters is cash flows. At some point you‚Äôre gonna have a liquidity crisis and when the liquidity is not available, companies have to create their own liquidity and that‚Äôs where fundamentals matter‚Ä¶they matter, to the extent that they are necessary for purchasing their own stock or buying other companies.

I‚Äôve used this analogy before, it‚Äôs kind of hokey, but I can‚Äôt think of a better one. If you‚Äôre on an airplane, 30,000 feet off the ground, that 30,000 feet off the ground is the valuation gap. Valuations are really high, but those engines are firing. Are you worried up in that plane about the valuations or are you worried about the speed and trajectory of where you‚Äôre going, based on the engines, based on the flows? The flows are what matter for where you‚Äôre going.

But when all of a sudden those engines go off, how far off the ground you are is all that matters. And so, [valuation] is more of a risk management tool, and ultimately it really matters when you have a liquidity crisis. It also matters if rates were to go back to 8, 9, 10%. Something crazy again, where nobody can borrow money, and there is no liquidity. Cash flows are all that matters again and we have a world where fundamentals are all that matters. So I want to be clear. It‚Äôs not that fundamentals don‚Äôt matter at all, it‚Äôs that they don‚Äôt matter in a world of massive liquidity."

GME was an anomaly. We embarrassed (I say we cause I had GME back in January). The very people that got embarrassed have degrees in this. Manage billions of dollars. Obviously know tricks that we do not....... It would seem they are making their money back and you‚Äôre confused when it suddenly goes south."

\*\*\*Trigger Warning\*\*\*

PLTR is a great company, but a TERRIBLE stock. 

We all know PLTR has a revolutionary new product of big data integration. We don't need another example of how useful it is. We know it, Wall Street knows it, your grandma at this point knows it. The problem with PLTR is that insiders are dropping their shares on the general public like there is no tomorrow. Look at their latest quarterly report for March 2021 and you will see that they have about 1.8m shares outstanding while in same time lat year, they only had 591k. This means your investment value literally decreased to about a third to what it was last year. This is why the stock isn't going to moon.

2021-07-01 12:22:06,wallstreetbets,"Got a small little trade thesis that doesn't warrant it's own thread so I'll just toss it in here instead!

&nbsp;

[DOW had an unwarranted drop from the top of it's channel on seemingly no news, and had a healthy bounce at the bottom](https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/i/Itr2fBpn.png). This enough wasn't really enough for a trade, as we kept running into resistance around 63.80. Now that we're over it, I'm comfortable loading a position.

&nbsp;

I'll be playing 65Cs and 67.5Cs expiring 8/20, though flat-out shares are also valid for this play! This is a solid company with strong fundamentals, so even if this play takes longer than expected to pan out, we're still holding a great company which will recover. Those holding options should look to cut losses if we fall out of this channel!

&nbsp;

All that being said, make sure you don't confuse this ticker for DIA! It's fairly easy to get them mixed up, haha. Godspeed traders."

2021-07-01 07:22:06,wallstreetbets,"BEAM is the real genome editing play IMO.

Most CRISPR systems use a small single guide RNA (sgRNA) along with a nuclease-proficient Cas9 to edit the genome. The sgRNA-Cas9 complex is ‚Äúguided‚Äù to a defined genomic location because of the complementarity of the sgRNA to the genomic DNA. When the complex arrives at its target location, Cas9 breaks the DNA backbone. Error-prone repair mechanisms then stitch the broken DNA ends back together in a process which adds or removes a few DNA letters. This disrupts the message encoded by that particular stretch of DNA. If that stretch of DNA encodes a protein that causes disease, the CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing may be sufficient to eliminate the disease.

Although the sgRNA-Cas9 complex cuts the genome in a specific location, the repair is error-prone and therefore non-specific. This type of system can in rare circumstances create unintended cuts or repair products that could theoretically promote cancer development.

BEAM, on the other hand, is developing nuclease-deficient base-editing Cas proteins, which still complex with sgRNAs to track to specific genomic locations but don‚Äôt cut DNA. Instead, these Cas proteins have been equipped with additional enzymatic activities that enable them to swap individual DNA letters for other letters (e.g. change a C to a T) and thereby directly correct single-letter mutations, which represent the majority of disease-causing mutations. Because base editors don‚Äôt cut DNA, this approach is theoretically safer and more specific than CRISPR-based cutting.

That is why I am long shares of BEAM."

Just a matter of time.

2021-07-01 12:07:38,wallstreetbets,Normally yields for longer term bonds are higher to compensate investors for increased risk since the future is unpredictable. When the yields of short term bonds are as high as those of long term it indicates that investors are getting worried about short term risk and when the yield curve inverses it means they are more worried about short term risk than they are long term. Which means trouble. This thing has had plenty of false positives though.
2021-07-01 12:08:56,wallstreetbets,I truly wonder if all the posting about positions on here if the big boys just did the opposite to make money.

2021-07-01 11:49:41,wallstreetbets,"theyll expire at close, but the thing with close to expiration, theyll most likely have higher theta so you risk wakin up tomorrow and seeing your position cut.

to be more clear, theyll close most likely an hr before close as most brokers close odte contracts prior to close, since you prob dont have the capital to exercise the option, so dont be surprsied if you hold for tomorrow and around 12pm PST it closes"
2021-07-01 11:50:27,wallstreetbets,They expire at close on 7/2
2021-07-01 11:52:38,wallstreetbets,"Your broker *should* end up selling them for you by market close 7/2. RH always used to do it for me, and TDA does as well, however TDA says it's on you to close them out. I'd exit by 2PM 7/2 or they'll probably exit them for you after that."
2021-07-01 11:53:09,wallstreetbets,"They will expire after close tomorrow, and theta will continue to decay if they are OTM.  If they are near the money I would close them rather than let them expire because they can be exercised after the market closes on Friday."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I‚Äôm bullish on RIGüò´ Skip to bottom to read summary 

If you look at my post history you‚Äôll see a few things in common, a lot of losses and a lot of dumb plays. If there are 2 stocks I‚Äôm holding long it‚Äôs SENS and a psychedelic stock that starts with an M that shall not be named other wise my post will get taken down. other than that I daytrade. Obviously I want to make up these losses and I believe we can do it in ONE stock. 

RIG or Transocean is an ‚ÄúLtd that commands one of the largest deep-water and ultra-deep-water fleets in the world. Its rigs operate globally, but the major deep-water basins are in West Africa, Brazil, and the Gulf of Mexico. Transocean's customers tend to be national oil companies, independents, and international oil companies.‚Äù

Basically when someone wants deep ocean oil they do it and since COVID wiped away almost all their competition in that area they‚Äôre at the top of their gain. So there a few reasons why I‚Äôm betting almost my entire cash position that I have left on this stock.

Insider buying 

According to Barron‚Äôs, ‚ÄúTransocean director Frederik W. Mohn paid $40.7 million from June 15 through June 22 for a total of 9.9 million shares, a per share average price of $4.11. Mohn made the purchases through Perestroika AS, a Norwegian investment firm of which he is the sole director and owner, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Perestroika now owns 77.6 million Transocean shares. It was Mohn‚Äôs first purchases of Transocean stock on the open market since 2018.‚Äù 
If you also check on openinsider you‚Äôll see that these statements are all true and you can the purchases made.
Also, ‚ÄúContinental founder and Chairman Harold Hamm paid $12.5 million from June 15 through June 18 for a total of 346,486 shares, a per share average price of $36.07. Hamm purchased the stock through a personal account, which now holds 13.4 million Continental shares.‚Äù
This is also his first open market purchase this year.

So executives buying into a stock at this quantity is always a good sign, but why not compare it to the past when they‚Äôve done it?

In 2019 when they did this the stock price jumped 35% within a month 
In 2020 it jumped 73% within a month 
This year it‚Äôs jumped 25% within 2 weeks, however with rising oil prices we might get to see the highest growth we‚Äôve ever seen.

This brings me to my second point.
OIL PRICES KEEP MOVING HIGHER, multiple oil companies have already broken out what‚Äôs to say RIG can‚Äôt be next.
According to Bezinga, ‚ÄúIf crude continues to trend higher, and many analysts think it will, more investors will be buying oil-related stocks. This could cause RIG to break out and make a move higher.‚Äù

Thats an obvious play and this next part I saw on another post about RIG, but I forgot the username so if you see this and you wrote it credit PM me and I‚Äôll credit you. 
When RIG was trading at $25 OIL BBL was trading at $100. Oil BBL is at 74.29 right now, if it were to go past 100 RIG would have to go to at least $15 PPS. THATS ALMOST A 350% GAIN. 
Anyway while there‚Äôs a lot more DD to do on this matter, I‚Äôm bullish on RIG and like the casino this is, hopefully I can make it all back with just one more bet.

Summary as promised
Insiders bought more than 100 million worth of stock in the past 2 weeks, when they did this before it went up 35% in a month 2019 and 73% in a month in 2020.
Oil prices are rising therefore RIG become more valuable.
Then can go up to $15 with about 350% upside.
Buy RIG"

2021-07-01 09:37:46,wallstreetbets,"I have a deep understanding of this space, specifically offshore drilling. How deep?  Thigpen was once my assigned mentor. ‚ÄúOil‚Äù and offshore drilling are not one and the same. There will be idiots and indices that will move this stock some with the price of oil, but there is a significant difference now than the last time oil hit $100. That is shale plays. You see, offshore oil deposits are elephant hunting. They‚Äôre big gambles, require enormous capex and take years to develop. So they‚Äôre not something that the operators jump into because we‚Äôve had six months of good oil prices. Shale plays by contrast are much less risky and require much less capital outlay for incremental barrels of oil. What this means is that the incremental oil production as prices rise will come firstly from shale investment as it‚Äôs a safer, cheaper investment with a quicker roi. In an environment where people are waging war against your product (oil & nat gas) ROI is now a much more significant consideration. 

Will offshore drilling recover?  Probably eventually but you have to understand what really moves the price of these companies beyond the dumb money and indexes that reflexively react to oil prices. What moves the price of offshore drilling contractors is rig fleet utilization and day rates.  Utilization will likely see incremental gains this year. Given the number of warm stacked and cold stacked rigs day rates will likely not improve significantly for a very long time."

2021-07-01 12:58:31,wallstreetbets,"I've seen it so many times across so many industries -- the best bang-for-the-buck plays are the stocks that just barely escape bankruptcy. 

I've owned a few of them. Bought Zales at $2, it got taken out at $21. Rode USG down to a dollar, a couple years later it was trading three digits. Saw General Growth Properties trade down to 85¬¢, had people in the know telling me the equity's good and they were right, it was at $16 a year later. (It's now part of Brookfield.) Had an insurance company go from like $6 to $36 in three years awhile back. Usually these end in takeovers.

Now why don't I have a Lamborghini and a four-bedroom house in Aspen from owning all these? Because I only owned a thousand shares or less. Still not bad money, bought a car with one of the winners, but I kept thinking if I only owned a few thousand shares instead of a few hundred....

of course when I hedge BABA it refuses to gap down and make my leaps sad, might just ditch my puts so the yacht boys can get a good entry at 224.80

There's a couple reasons why, but mostly they already have inroads into the US through partnershipships and acquisitions and have achieved scale unlike the US.

Getting distribution, production, and transportation down with scale is going to take a while for US companies, most likely they are going to be bought out by bigger players or big tobbaco like MO and BTI. 

The margins the older and bigger companies have will just be to hard to beat. While the American companies start to ramp up proper scale they'll most likely be bought out...

That doesn't mean there won't be great American weed stocks to buy. Think curlf and crlbf are good ones that have a chance to make it out as big players after legalization.

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I forgot where I put my tendies (BIIB DD) As I sit here typing with my grease covered fingers I can't help but wonder where my sweet crispy delicious tenders have gone. The mind wanders a long winding route which has led me to this delicious take:

Biogen's market cap is 20% lower than 3 years ago. The company has repurchased about  35% of its shares since 2015 as well while its share price has been under pressure due to competition and generics for the majority of its main drugs. 

Things seemed very dire for Biogen with the FDA panel voting unanimously against an approval for its alzheimer's treatment.

But as we all know, when things seemed most dire, the heroic CEO of Biogen threatened to release pee sex tapes or something like that and the FDA approved the drug. Maybe they weren't pee sex tapes but I find it highly plausible. The exact nature still needs to be determined. I bet they speak German during the videos though.

This is a 29B+ USD/year opportunity for the company and Aduhelm has the opportunity to be the biggest biologic released in history. Questions around its efficacy are still flying around but that does not change the fact that the drug has been approved. There's an ongoing congressional enquiry but we all know how that goes.

I would assign a slight pricing risk to the launch but generally there is more smoke than fire around pharma pricing - specifically in the biologics space. Alzheimers care and long term treatment is a 600B+ industry in America and this drug isn't even a fraction of the cost. 

Sales forecasts for this have it fully replacing and rapidly exceeding the lost revenue from other drugs by 2023 and their mediocre pipeline is included for free as part of the bargain.

New drug launch is going to put the stock on the moon (or at least 30% higher(I just arbitrarily picked this number)). 

TLDR: My autism can't get treated but the USGOV is going to pay 56k a year to help me remember that I already ate my sweet crispy chicken tenders."

Hey /u/frogpuddles, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit."
2021-07-01 04:54:06,wallstreetbets,"Look, the FDA approved probably because somebody owed someone somewhere a favor or a hand job or something.  Turns out, it's not particularly effective, but, the good news is that it's not particularly harmful either.  It's an expensive drug.  The fact that it's ineffective means the price will come down a lot.  Meanwhile, there are much more effective drugs on the cusp of approval.  When a stock is already in the mid triple digits on anticipation, the approval pop is always a ""sell the news"" event.  Sometimes right away, sometimes a few weeks later.  Turns out, the best treatment is assuming a proper plant based diet from your 20s to your 90s.  Ain't nobody got time for that, so they get pills and injections in their 60s."
2021-07-01 11:14:25,wallstreetbets,"This drug is an absolute travesty, internal reviewers at the FDA are baffled at its approval as it barely showed benefit or efficacy. 40% of the patients get brain swelling. Doctors across the US have sworn they won‚Äôt prescribe it and Alzheimer‚Äôs Researchers are appalled that it was approved. 

Now getting off the old moral soapbox, this stock will probably make money, maybe for years. But if this ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù drug has some unforeseen consequences in the coming years, the share price will likely get annihilated."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"negative divergence on CLF and why I am bullish... wait what? sup fuckers, so get this... I have been losing lots of money on options since entering into the stock market and hearing about Ryan C's move on a particular well-liked stock in December.  


I got jacked-titties hearing about everyone making money here on r/wallstreetbets and I was like: ""fuck... if a bunch of retards on reddit can make millions, hell so can I.""  


annnnnnnd I've lost **EVERY** single option trade I have entered... I've made a few 10% returns on only-stock trades but the returns from those trades were tossed back into FD and bi-weekly's that all expired worthless.  


YTD on my options trading (throwing shit at the wall) I have a verifiable **100% loss rate**. pretty sick huh?

  


https://preview.redd.it/eghxc915uj871.png?width=4256&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c2fd55c39f401506b19d0f15f5e4450f57ecc6d

so after losing another **K** this last week (a lot of money for me) - I am done losing. fucking done.

&#x200B;

how you might ask?  


using an option strategy 'of course' called a ""**gut-spread strangle**"". for those that don't know, a gut-spread strangle is where you buy an ITM call and an ITM put with identical expiration dates. how a strangle can profit is typically one of two possible ways: the stock rises in price enough to cover the call and put premiums (aka money back) or vice versa (price falls enough to get all money back). so essentially you are sacrificing one contract for the other.  


by the stock either rising high enough OR falling low enough in price, I can now slaughter which ever sacrificial option that gives me my money back. now I have covered my initial investment and I still have one near-worthless option left over.  


the second step of this strategy that I will be personally attempting for you ^((\*bow)) all is once the sacrificial option returns my initial investment, I will then repeat the process by entering another gut-spread strangle at current price (ideally during a low-volatility day to reduce the premium cost of the options).  


during the second step of this strategy I now have an ITM call, ITM put, and an OTM option that should be nearly worthless, and the reason for holding onto this OTM option is just in case the price moves back in the other direction; I will then have a DEEP ITM option and the option that should be apart of my initial investment that should be worth a little somethin' somethin.  


the only way this strategy doesn't work is if there is no volatility or price movement to close either option before the options' expiration dates. now if this strategy doesn't work that would be pretty bizarre due to two reasons...

1) if you place the contracts' expiration dates out far enough (months).

2) use this strategy on any stock seen in **Hot / Top** posts

# 

# so what is negative divergence and what does this have to do with CLF?

&#x200B;

obv is on balance volume, the numbers don't really mean shit but typically the obv and price action ""should"" follow similar trends.

this is fidelity's explanation on negative divergence with the OBV:

[Negative divergence is when Price reaches higher peaks and OBV fails to make higher peaks.](https://preview.redd.it/opnvtijdsj871.png?width=2718&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6ff4538511324965cc86e2a72f0e9b85310a7a2)

there you have the definition. now onto why this relates to CLF:

take a look at the daily price action of Cleveland-Cliffs from **March 21 - Today**

^((2019) **^(up till)** ^(2021, CLF's price had a strong correlation to the OBV pretty much doing the exact same trends))

&#x200B;

[CLF price action trending up | CLF obv trending down](https://preview.redd.it/3eqv4lrqtj871.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=6aebfd55c48a35053b9a9de5006251d1ad0c3d2b)

the green arrow (price) is clearly moving upwards month after month since March.

the red arrow (obv) is clearly moving downwards since March / April.

if you look at the years before 2021 you see a strong correlation between the price and obv trends.  


so why am I bullish on a stock that has a negative divergence? well because it imposes further volatility of the price. the price is BOUND to do something. I don't know if it will continue the divergence with the price continuing to rise or whether it will fall in the following weeks due to obv dropping.  


doesn't matter to me honestly, the following are my main reasons for choosing this stock and this stock alone for this option strategy:

* I think the steel industry is strong
* I heard talks about Biden with an infrastructure deal (idkwtf that means other than construction money handouts)
* the company has 17B in assets w/ an 80% debt to asset ratio
* company undervalued at 10B
* earnings date = July 21

so yea - price can go up and I'll be happy

so yea - price can go down and I'll be happy

so yea - if price doesn't move at all before exp. date I swear to god I will tattoo ""FUCK MY LIFE"" onto myself

&#x200B;

tl;dr - I'm gonna make money in either direction or will tattoo myself out of embarrassment

&#x200B;

k now fuck off

&#x200B;

^((let me know if I have to vErIfIcAtIoN of my strangle trade on CLF))"

2021-07-01 06:50:52,wallstreetbets,Not if u set up a calendar spread when it trades sideways like that u can gain the farther out expiration while the shorter date calls u sell expir worthless ‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs what u want‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
2021-07-01 12:37:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, no sweat.  This stock isn't going down on any medium or long term timeline (barring a full blown economic crash). So long as you're protected against short term fluctuations, you can make money off CLF."
2021-07-01 09:15:52,wallstreetbets,"I might try it with one of the high volatile stocks like SOFI. In theory 19C 07/2 would cost you \~.70 and the 19.5P would cost \~82. Total cost would be $152. The Call and Put have a delta of .56. If it were to go down $1, your call would be at \~126$ while your put would be at \~38. So you're still down \~30$ from the original investment. If the stock moves drastically and it goes up or down 2$ and the Call or put becomes very volatile increasing its delta you would lose less money and make more of a profit from the Put just because of the higher cost value to you. So, you would have to try to get something very close to each other to make the most profit. IE: cost of call would be .75 and Put would be like .79 or something. I will test see how it goes. Might declare bankruptcy, haha."
2021-07-01 06:57:09,wallstreetbets,"could you elaborate a bit further?

a calendar spread is buying multiple calls (or puts) at same strike prices but with different expiration dates.

but what if the stock drops?

p.s. what I want is minimal risk with expected/repeatable gains."
2021-07-01 09:17:38,wallstreetbets,"lol well keep me up to date with your weekly strategy in a volatile stock.

best of luck to you man. ‚Äúyou can only lose so much‚Äù"
2021-07-01 07:10:05,wallstreetbets,The purpose of the calendar spread is to cap losses‚Ä¶.. if it goes down u only pay 40% of premium versus 100% with a chance to live on the next week ‚Ä¶.. also u want the 10 contracts u sell to expire worthless or to buy back a lot cheaper then u sold‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ gives u way more options to trade based on different outcomes
2021-07-01 07:07:46,wallstreetbets,Like yesterday I bought 10 22 strike expir next Friday‚Ä¶. I then sell 10 22 strike that expir tomarro ‚Ä¶.. if it goes down or stays flat the 10 contracts u sold expir worthless and u then have 10 contracts that don‚Äôt expire till the next week ‚Ä¶. So the 10 contracts u sold paid for 70% of the contracts u bought‚Ä¶.. if the stock skyrockets u can sell the whole spread for a fat gain or hope your 10 sells expire worthless leaving u with 10 contracts to sell the next week‚Ä¶.
2021-07-01 07:58:50,wallstreetbets,"interesting to say the least - would you be open to dm'ing me so we can talk about this strategy further.  


I need to continue trying out my method to see if it works and can bring reliable returns so I will not be jumping ship. I will sink with this bitch.  


but yea I'd like to hear more about your strategy. sounds effective at face value."
2021-07-01 07:50:24,wallstreetbets,"I must be retarded... why is this so complex for me to understand...

&#x200B;

how do you sell 10 contracts that expire tomorrow if you didn't buy them first?  


could you explain it to a 3rd grader? my comprehension of options goes about as far as, you can buy calls and puts. I understand a bit of the greeks that make up the values but I do not understand coverage or selling something you don't own.  


sorry this is how smooth my brain is with options. hence 6 months of losses.  


don't give up on me, keep teaching me"
2021-07-01 08:09:29,wallstreetbets,Ok yesterday‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. At the same time I sold 10 contracts 22 strike expir today and I bought 10 contracts 22 strike expire next Friday‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.with me so far‚Ä¶..
2021-07-01 08:11:34,wallstreetbets,If it doesn‚Äôt hit 22 today those contracts I sold will expire worthless‚Ä¶the ones I bought won‚Äôt expire till next Friday‚Ä¶.. you can sell contracts on td ameritrade I don‚Äôt about robinhood‚Ä¶..
2021-07-01 08:13:40,wallstreetbets,U can sell contracts u don‚Äôt have ‚Ä¶.. if I lose I have to pay ie buy back for more money‚Ä¶ but since I also bought some farther out date they make money faster than the short dated
2021-07-01 08:17:31,wallstreetbets,"ok I get it now 100%. I have Fidelity and Rapinghood. I have two others but I don‚Äôt use them. I‚Äôll keep this strategy in mind.

thank you for sharing this with me and wrinkling my brain."
2021-07-01 08:23:17,wallstreetbets,No problem I‚Äôm glad u understand it is a more veteran options play but what I‚Äôve learned is the more complicated options plays are usually way safer than regular options plays
2021-07-01 14:39:40,wallstreetbets,Is this also known as selling poor mans covered call?
2021-07-01 15:42:00,wallstreetbets,In a way yes ‚Ä¶ the whole point of the calendar spread is to buy a lot of contracts and u have multiple plays exit points u can work to ‚Ä¶. It just provides more than just a simple poor mans cc

ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH) announces that CFO Rajat Bahri plans to resign from his position effective July 23.

The company has engaged executive search firm Heidrick and Struggles to identify Mr. Bahri‚Äôs successor.

Meanwhie, Chief Accounting Officer Brett Just and Director of FP&A Jennifer Oliver will serve as interim co-CFOs, reporting directly to executive chair, Jackie Reses.  

Thoughts??? Any ideas for ideal candidate?

2021-07-01 08:39:30,wallstreetbets,"This isn‚Äôt FUD, but there always has been an accounting issue at WISH.  They are an e-commerce platform for online sellers (mostly China), and they collect a percentage of sales.  HOWEVER, they count the entire sale as REVENUE, even though 85% of it is immediately transferred to the merchants.  So WISH is claiming $2.5bn in revenues for the year, where revenues are actually about $250m.  Essentially, WISH is claiming merchant revenues as their own and using it to calculate their EBITDA."

2021-07-01 02:52:11,wallstreetbets,Sale high... wait for a month and use funds to buy back in once it drops close to support level.. rinse and repeat
2021-07-01 02:54:49,wallstreetbets,"Sell, if it‚Äôs good enough for a screenshot, it‚Äôs good enough to take profits"
2021-07-01 03:40:13,wallstreetbets,"Mine are shares so I really don‚Äôt mind holding a little longer. 
These are the catalysts I believe are yet to push the stock: 
- Approval from China for the merger. 
- TSMC using slavery to manufacture chips. Which will lead to increase in chip supply.
- PS5 and XBoX back in stock. 
- New partnerships are being announced every month. 

But the biggest one I‚Äôm waiting for this month is the ‚ÄúGo‚Äù from China. This could push the stock over 100$ by end of the month."
2021-07-01 07:36:25,wallstreetbets,"Take some profits, it‚Äôs moving rather quick and it‚Äôs possible you may lose some momentum as it approaches that 52 week high."

2021-07-01 04:23:47,wallstreetbets,Ita better to take profit now since the premium is high.
2021-07-01 04:31:01,wallstreetbets,Sell
2021-07-01 04:58:05,wallstreetbets,Id sell the 2022s and hang onto the 2023s since theres some big things coming up for AMD in a few weeks
2021-07-01 06:44:29,wallstreetbets,"Why not sell the strike above ($80C with the same expiration) to turn these into spreads? Then, if price drops significantly, you can buy back the sold contracts for a profit and hold the long calls for another run? If that drop doesn‚Äôt happen, you‚Äôre still in a gain position. It‚Äôs basically a win-win, but it caps your gains."
2021-07-01 08:08:44,wallstreetbets,"I was about to berate you until I realized these are leaps. 63% is nothing to scoff at, but this could definitely go higher. I‚Äôd probably sell and buy back in at consolidation and make those sweet volatility tendies."
2021-07-01 10:27:41,wallstreetbets,"No idea what‚Äôs going on with amd at this point, probably dropping because of MSM so I‚Äôd hold, if you didn‚Äôt sell yesterday it‚Äôs probably not worth selling it today after the drop"
2021-07-01 03:23:05,wallstreetbets,Hold till it hits your price target. Mine is 120
2021-07-01 06:48:54,wallstreetbets,Hold
2021-07-01 08:02:58,wallstreetbets,I would sell. AMD is one of those stocks...
2021-07-01 09:19:02,wallstreetbets,"If you still like the stock and think it's going to continue to go up you could sell and buy something not so deep itm. Then your percent gains will be higher. If you think it's going to stall out it's a good exit point because premiums are probably higher from all the momentum. 

Personally, I am not selling mine until at least $100."
2021-07-01 03:12:42,wallstreetbets,"I can‚Äôt make up my mind on AMD so I keep closing out my options and buying new ones, missing big gains but taking some smaller ones at least."
2021-07-01 02:56:05,wallstreetbets,Have a habit of buying earlier and having to hold or selling early for minimal profit XD
2021-07-01 02:59:05,wallstreetbets,Well let‚Äôs hope tomorrow is green. A lot can change pretty quickly ‚ò†Ô∏è guess I better be up at 8:30 central lol
2021-07-01 13:21:50,wallstreetbets,Yea I woke up late and saw red so I didn‚Äôt sell. Would have if it was green.
2021-07-01 18:00:41,wallstreetbets,I would hold. AMD is one of those stocks‚Ä¶
2021-07-01 03:13:22,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs been me since $32 AMD
2021-07-01 03:10:45,wallstreetbets,It's better to make a 20-35% profit and miss a big jump than take a 40-50% loss because you held too long...
2021-07-01 06:00:57,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I have this habit too XD. I sold 10 AMDs for 78‚Ç¨ and made 60 ‚Ç¨ Profit on ten stocks. Oh well. Let's see if it dips below 70 ‚Ç¨ again :D"
2021-07-01 13:25:00,wallstreetbets,"Wonder if this is just a correction and people trying to get out because they saw WSB was in on it, there‚Äôs literally 0 reason for the drop today"
2021-07-01 03:11:44,wallstreetbets,Yea I thought this was good enough to pull out forsureüò¨ but $AMD has been good to me
2021-07-01 17:59:58,wallstreetbets,Most of the market was down today.

2021-07-01 03:08:59,wallstreetbets,Lesson learned - sell when you make a screenshot.

2021-07-01 03:42:42,wallstreetbets,I'm really confused. At 4k cost you paid 29¬¢ each for the change above 200 on 13500 shares. Baidu never dipped below 203 that day as far as I can see. The value theta not withstanding should be the (# of contracts√óshares per contract√óprice over strike-the cost payed)135√ó100√ó(3-.29)=36585 so either you are really stupid or I am? If this happened on the 25th the math makes more sense but then that 40k number was a glitch and you would never have really gotten that much.
2021-07-01 04:09:51,wallstreetbets,"Rule of thumb, when it‚Äôs good enough to screenshot, SELL‚Ä¶ unless you want to take multiple screenshots"

2021-07-01 10:14:26,wallstreetbets,I wish you never get to see one (without selling)
2021-07-01 05:01:24,wallstreetbets,"Ah I see I'm retarded you are an hour behind me as well which messed me up scanning through based on time. Ouch that hurts, the next 3 days hurt even more. At least you came out ahead. I've had the opposite happen where I was down 60% of my account and came back up to even in one of the last days and sold that shit for a small loss. I was depressed for months watching my own stupidity before it came back and I really started  looking into how to not let it happen again. If I was you I would focus on the not buying 135 contracts ever escpecially not near experation. I don't think you can be down on yourself for not selling that crazy ass spike, or for selling as it fell. Selling off portions on the way up isn't easy to do either and again this shit happened so fast. Your reaction was incredibley normal. One of the first things I learned losing money here was that the amount I thought I felt comfortable risking and what I could actually risk comfortably were two very different things. I couldn't do this amount of risk and think sanely if it was over 1% of my account. You took on a mind bogglingly large amount of risk my friend. Like ass puckering heart pounding risk. If it makes you feel better I bought a 100c on gme and sold it for an 800$ gain instead of the 25k it would of been worth 2 days later. I also sold nio on a small dip around $6.20. This shit happens to everybody. I found a website called breakingthemarket that discusses repeated bets as the true metric of risk calculation and it made a lot of sense to me. It was called geometric gains and basically it said risking catastrophic losses will end in bankrupt. By taking on so much risk you are risking going to 0 and ending the game, it doesn't matter how many zeroes you end up with in your account during your trip to 0 if you risk 100% over and over you WILL lose it all. It has helped me reel in my previously massively skewed risk reward from this sub. I never wanted to watch my life savings get cut in half again. I'm not joking about the depression I fucked myself up with my own stupidity. It sounds like you had a similar moment. Did you by chance average your way down into this position?"
2021-07-01 16:02:28,wallstreetbets,Margin on rh sounds like a good idea‚Ä¶. Sorry for the confusion

I noticed a number of people who were caught by surprise by the explosion of options activity for New Egg. You can use this list to see what has been recently added with options chains or existing options that have been altered. Tomorrow's list includes some altered ETFs but there are plenty of other juicy tickers that were added today. Do with that what you will. Happy hunting!

Edit.  Actually there is a newly offered option chain on LFST for July 1.   Not a recommendation of course.

Just thought I'd throw that out there because it's something to keep an eye on.  Especially if you recognize a well known company such as New Egg in the new listings."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PLTR is a ticking time bomb *Pre-statements: Yes I have $AMC shares and calls. No, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor so use this as you may :) Reasoning and DD is below****, but for people like me who sometimes don‚Äôt wanna read the whole post, I‚Äôm adding the summary first.*** 

Current $PLTR Holding: 492 shares, 5x $30 and 10x $28 weeklies and 2 x $30 calls expiring November 19th. 

# Summary

 I‚Äôm heavily invested in $PLTR shares for the long term because this time next year we should be over $100. **But weekly calls are the point of this post.**

I got a few $30 and $28 weekly calls on Monday, but I‚Äôm going hard on the $28+ weekly calls tomorrow since they‚Äôre now so cheap (Also for security I‚Äôm buying a few calls for the same strikes expiring next week too). Why? Because one little push and we‚Äôre breaking the last resistance wall at $27.50 and when we do we will be gapping back up to $45ish fast. We are all on the edge of our seats awaiting the FDIC contract news which should be announced any day now, and I believe that can be the final catalyst that pushes us into a hugeeee run like $SPCE last week. If that happens by Friday the weekly calls I get tomorrow will make me so much money! After all, we are about gambling, and this reward heavily outweighs the risks. 

# Now the boring stuff, my reasoning and DD:

**$Pltr one year chart:**

The entire chart is bullish. And if you look at it you can see it‚Äôs ready to break out at any moment. Once it does, it has a huge gap up to $45ish to fill. The last resistance is at $27.50 right now which we tested the other day. Once we break that I see a huge rally coming in. Also, we closed at $26.66 yesterday, when we closed there in January it dipped the next day, then ran to its ATH around $45 during the next 2 days. So far 2 out 3 of those things have repeated themselves, will all 3!?

&#x200B;

**The Trillion dollar evaluations**

This is more debated in the MSM, but many say it will have a $1 trillion evaluation within the next 10 years. What sold me on it being probably true was when Seeking Alpha released an article saying there‚Äôs absolutely no way it‚Äôll happen üòâ Other analysts have written about why it is likely to happen, they lay it out plain and simple, and the ideas add up! 

**They continue to land huge contracts.** 

Left and right $PLTR is landing new partnerships and huge contracts. They‚Äôre one of the top companies working with the government and are constantly growing into new industries. The overall growth rate is amazing and speaks for itself. Also if we are awarded the FDIC contract, it means almost all banks will have to start using $PLTRs technology. 

***So either I‚Äôm gonna make a ton of money on these weeklies or just be really sad and pout all weekend.***"

2021-07-01 00:22:26,wallstreetbets,I know some of these words
2021-07-01 01:52:45,wallstreetbets,"You got one thing right for sure, the chart is fuggin bullish. If you look at the one day candles we've seen a beautiful up trend since mid May with regular consolidations. We had six green days in a row right before the last two red days and they haven't even been too red. Tomorrow will most likely be green and test that resistance again. 

I also have weeklys, leaps, and shares. Pltr is my baby."

2021-07-01 08:47:17,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-07-01 10:46:15,wallstreetbets,"So... How long do we wait before we start offering condolences on those weeklies?

You'll make it back easy enough. They were probably dirt cheap, anyway. Respec'."
2021-07-01 00:24:57,wallstreetbets,"I am long pltr. However weeklies on this seems nuts. I don't even do options but IV must be insane in this. Theta on weeklies must also be insane. Again I don't do options but just my view (might be entirely incorrect).

I don't even know if current price is a ""good"" price. What I do think is long term PLTR is going to the fucking moon. I just don't know when. As such I am just long in it now and accept it may drop 50% before it gets to the moon. This might also be the cheapest price I can get moving forward which is why I have a small long position in it.

I disagree the 1 year chart is bullish. It doesn't really show much of anything other than volatility to me and resistance at current levels. Stock could really go either way.

I know wsb loves weeklies but wouldn't it be better for wsb to start making money for a change? Like you can't fuck this up if you just buy and hold it."
2021-07-01 04:18:41,wallstreetbets,Lol. I‚Äôm long pltr and hold a large % in my portfolio but it‚Äôs not getting anywhere near your prices short term. Or 100 by next year this team. Da fuq you smoking

2021-07-01 08:48:34,wallstreetbets,Profit taking is normal after such a good runup from 19 dollars to 27 dollars (40% gain) over a period of 1.5 months. I will be happy if the stock consolidates around 25-26 for a while before making the next significant step up to 35-40.

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Short term play on China power shortage China is currently facing their worst power shortage in over a decade, which has led to power rationing of major factories in Guangdong (among other important regions) and for many factories to shut down production for a few days out of the week. 

This has the potential to continue through end of the year according to article below:

[https://www.9news.com.au/national/china-news-power-shortage-crisis/d32ebdbb-be14-4c78-abc2-5f43d429a554](https://www.9news.com.au/national/china-news-power-shortage-crisis/d32ebdbb-be14-4c78-abc2-5f43d429a554)

With reduced manufacturing capabilities coming from China, I think there could be a lucrative play shorting companies who rely on these exports downstream, or on these Chinese manufacturers themselves. 

The first areas impacted that come to mind for me are US automotive, computers & electronic products, or simply shorting VWO which is very China heavy. 

Thoughts on this play? 

Other ideas for other sectors that may be impacted, or plays to make assuming this will have the impact suggested by this article?"

2021-07-01 00:15:32,wallstreetbets,I live in NYC and we (everyone to their phone) just got an Amber alert today about lowering our Electric use to avoid power outages so honestly i could see this happening to NY. But I'm not sure which stocks/ETF's to buy to profit off it.
2021-07-01 01:24:24,wallstreetbets,"Find out which diesel generators they are likely to use and see if you can go long on that for a short term play maybe. They might be renting them so maybe look into who provides that kind of service in that geographic location.

Trying to short industries seems sketch to me. Ones big enough to be listed are likely to have business continuity plans in place. It's probably super bad for small businesses who can't bribe who they need to to ensure they don't get rationed.

Interesting trade idea though."
2021-07-01 11:38:59,wallstreetbets,Keep in mind how large China is. You might as well say all of America is also suffering a power shortage when in fact it's just the east coast due to the heat wave and the surge in air con use...

2021-06-30 23:54:45,wallstreetbets,"That's a fair point, so maybe shorting the VWO or Golden Dragon China Index wouldn't be the play. 

However this would raise prices of supplies for US companies depending on those exports, who will not be able to offset the cost with immediate raises in prices. 

I expect this could hurt companies like Apple, P&G, etc. in the short term until supply is less constrained."

I lost life changing money multiple times through stupid shit like this. I am pretty sure a lot of people on this sub have. Make hard decisions and recover. Don‚Äôt forget to eat, make sure you exercise (just not those options, and get your sleep. It sucks big time and I think we get it. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up about this.

2021-07-01 18:05:42,wallstreetbets,This market is no time to play options unless you have a lot of experience. They go up for 2 and down for 20. Just wait till dow hits 37k or so soon after they will all shit when it drops 65% and then you can throw a dart at the board and make money.
2021-07-01 18:08:34,wallstreetbets,"Best of luck. Push the contracts

2021-07-01 06:18:43,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd be your sugar daddy but I also have lost all my money gambling in the stock market.
2021-07-01 09:48:34,wallstreetbets,"Nobody is coming to save you, $BB already busted at $20 and everyone cashed out and moved on to another stock. If you have shares keep them for the long run and as soon as you can make a profit bail out. Again nobody is coming to save you you made your choice and this is gambling not a team effort"
2021-07-01 11:30:03,wallstreetbets,How many more people are gonna get burned by BB before WSB realizes it‚Äôs trash and stops hyping it up?
2021-07-01 17:05:05,wallstreetbets,AMC and gme are the only stocks worth investing in everything else is a distraction in my smooth brained opinion

2021-07-01 13:23:59,wallstreetbets,"Can not confirm vagina, but can confirm OP has a hole. And when there's a hole, there's a goal."

2021-06-30 23:36:23,wallstreetbets,BB is actually Latin for coke and hookers
2021-07-01 01:43:51,wallstreetbets,I shorted hookers but the cocaine gains are lit
2021-07-01 00:06:59,wallstreetbets,"I will split  half an 8 ball or 1/16th of meth

2021-07-01 01:07:49,wallstreetbets,You can be in hookers but the coke is in you
2021-07-01 01:47:43,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the ticker for hookers? Sounds like a solid investment
2021-07-01 03:38:24,wallstreetbets,One of you will end up a hooker with the other sucking coke
2021-07-01 16:23:23,wallstreetbets,"Im in hookers, they said hello"

2021-06-30 23:57:08,wallstreetbets,Interesting. Exactly the opposite situation playing out here. Exactly. The. Opposite.
2021-07-01 09:26:37,wallstreetbets,"No. I know nothing. I just bought my portfolio's value in otm calls because they were itm at the time. And smart money is dumb for following my lead with 15,000 of their own"
2021-07-01 12:54:31,wallstreetbets,So like‚Ä¶what‚Äôs the secret code to the new club where everyone‚Äôs hiding from the Fud?
2021-07-01 04:20:52,wallstreetbets,"You are right, it's hard to know if WKHS is not just another Hedge fund pump and dump. Luckily we are here in the ground floor, so we can catch the ride. But it's really hard to know what manipulation is really going on."
2021-07-01 09:36:23,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôre all full of it. Can‚Äôt trust any subs since January. They‚Äôre all infiltrated
2021-07-01 15:10:41,wallstreetbets,Because those have been there since before all the ruckus.  All the new ones... P&d.
2021-07-01 17:37:38,wallstreetbets,I got a sweet tooth and a foot fetish
2021-07-01 14:43:04,wallstreetbets,Dibs on uncle with benefits
2021-07-01 10:13:47,wallstreetbets,12-24 months will see the stock holding above $20.   Long term play.  Just buy some and forget about it.
2021-07-01 04:21:02,wallstreetbets,"If you're being serious and not facetious (it's hard to tell haha) - it'll fly after it starts showing more sales (so not within the next 3 months), or if it secures a huge government cyber security contract (wild card; can happen at any time), or if some CNBC guest pumps it (wild card; happened a month ago and fueled the squeeze from $8 to $20), or when the AWS Ivy revenue starts coming in at some point in late 2022-23 (guaranteed profit; won't happen for at least another year).

Patience, young padawan. :) Also, all that info is available in most half-decent BB DDs - always do your research before you buy a stonk, or you could end up trapped upside down in a shitty company. (I'd done my BB research in January, so I didn't stress when I got trapped with my $17 average; I averaged down to $10 and then sold for $19.50 in June. :) )

Good luck."
2021-07-01 17:05:12,wallstreetbets,second this. i double down for clov
2021-06-30 23:37:26,wallstreetbets,"BB was always a long term thing,  black berry's need 5 years to establish a really decent bush"
2021-07-01 09:41:15,wallstreetbets,"With BB, you gotta hold long term. Then, when you finally, get rich, you can pay for your funeral and leave a trust fund for your dying pets."
2021-07-01 03:13:26,wallstreetbets,"If I have learned anything from WSB, it's that if a stock is trending on a thread, it's too late to buy in (unless you just yolo and get lucky with something like GME). Even AMC I expected to just go up slowly from $10 to 20ish or even pre-covid numbers as time went on and they stabilized. Got really fucking lucky when the circus came into town and the apes on unicycles (fuck bears) rallied that stock all the way to 63."
2021-07-01 00:13:07,wallstreetbets,Same here man same here down 26k ü•¥

2021-07-01 16:43:03,wallstreetbets,"If you don‚Äôt use it all in that first year, you can carry forward each year, using $3k per year until it‚Äôs gone."
2021-07-01 16:55:46,wallstreetbets,Was this a serious question?
2021-07-01 17:59:08,wallstreetbets,That would be a question for your CPA. It might require an amended return.
2021-07-01 17:49:38,wallstreetbets,Well of course! They'll make a profit off ya from the prison and cry for more money while doing it!! üòä
2021-07-01 16:22:42,wallstreetbets,Luckily i was long on bb before the memes
2021-07-01 16:37:20,wallstreetbets,"OP is a dumb fuck

But respect to OP for posting their stupid moves for others to see"
2021-07-01 02:19:45,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, it‚Äôs gems like these that keep me scrolling"
2021-07-01 13:34:21,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a cliff edge."

2021-07-01 13:41:32,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs called doing your own research
2021-07-01 14:46:03,wallstreetbets,"WKHS is a fuckin garbage stock, it‚Äôll be the next one you retards are posting loss porn for"
2021-07-01 17:19:13,wallstreetbets,"I think $180 is a realistic price target. That's on the safe side, it's most likely gonna be over 200"
2021-06-30 23:50:14,wallstreetbets,So what you're saying is she's underage
2021-07-01 04:24:20,wallstreetbets,"Yup lol. I was a BB bagholder for 4 months (a man needs a hobby!), and the entire WSB would point and laugh when we'd post a DD on the stonk, because the price would keep falling: 17, then 13, then 10, then high 7 LOL

After it finally spiked from $8 to $20, there were a ton of BB fanboys on WSB all of a sudden hahahaha. The best stonks to go after (aside from GME, that is) are those that specifically get very few mentions here but have large subreddits of their own. Anything else is too risky..."
2021-07-01 17:07:22,wallstreetbets,Hopefully you actually drive a gt3 rs and shrugged the loss off
2021-06-30 23:54:26,wallstreetbets,LOL. Your mama jokes still slap where you‚Äôre from?

I called back about three weeks ago to see if I could get it lowered again and they told me to wait a month. So today I sent them an email and they replied with a form I had to fill out.

Hello Jose, 

Thank you for contacting TD Ameritrade with your inquiry. My name is Faith Smith and I am happy to assist you today.

Thank you for reaching out to us about your trade commissions. While we do not have a flat fee for unlimited trading, monthly or otherwise, you can request to have a lower commission rate. This is certainly something I can investigate for you, but please understand that TD Ameritrade does stand by the value of our pricing since we do offer a lot more products and services that other discount brokerage firms do not, for example 24-hour customer service, 2 trading platforms at no charge, and Senior Financial Consultants for clients at a certain dollar value in their accounts, also at no charge to the client. 

Can you please respond with the following?
1. What rate would you be happy with?
2. Do you have any external assets you could transfer/consolidate with TD Ameritrade to get a lower rate and, if so, how much?
3. How active will you be trading in this account (trades per month) and what assets will you be trading?
4. What investments you are primarily interested in trading not only now but in the future?
5. Which brokerages are offering a lower rate, and what rate?
6. How many option trades per month, on average? External and internal option trading. 
7. How many option contracts per month, on average? External and internal option trading.

Please respond with this information, so we can better evaluate the situation. The more information I can collect, the bigger the case I can build for upper management to consider honoring your request. 

If you have any other questions please let us know. We're always happy to help.

Thank you for your business.

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Support.com-Greenidge merger Q3, inevitable 100%+ price jump Before everything, check out the chart and tell me you're not jacked to the fucken tits

&#x200B;

[BULL FLAG CLOSING](https://preview.redd.it/4k4ulnf0si871.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0e1007babbca69d50df6dee9e6dc33c27a5945b)

March 2021, support.com and Greenidge entered a merger deal that will close in Q3 allowing Greenidge to go public without an IPO (Q3 starts July 1, tomorrow).

Background: *support* is a techsupport company that has been in operation since 1997, its softwares are operated on all platforms, Windows, macOS, iOS, Android. It has been generating steady revenue.

&#x200B;

[support's revenue](https://preview.redd.it/j9rll0dqni871.png?width=343&format=png&auto=webp&s=36a9058b9cf7c95a25a235c3ddd1cf06cd8da665)

As of March 2021, it has $29 million of cash in hand, remember this number.

&#x200B;

[Cash position](https://preview.redd.it/z4uqvyesni871.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=bffd5ddf18dadb0b221b3ed5ed5a3c4b5aaa4e6b)

Greenidge used to be a electric power plant that runs on coal, it was shut down in 2011 due to environmental concerns. In 2017, Atlas Holdings LLC (private equity firm with $6 billion AUM) bought the plant and converted it to a **digital asset miner** that runs on green clean energy of natural gas.

Here is Greenidge's revenue stream based on its recent [S4 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001844971/000119312521149057/d166032ds4.htm), where it also is appointed the future ticker GREE which I will start to refer to from now.

&#x200B;

[GREE revenue](https://preview.redd.it/kylr0uutni871.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=14e9ec01a8c97b2dbd31186351522a2515f35d14)

**$20 million** in revenue.

I‚Äôll provide you with all the numbers for why I am confident the merger is worth way more than what the current *support* stock is priced right now.

* GREE mines almost as much as RIOT did in 2020 (1186 vs 1243)
* Chinese miners are out of the game = easier block = American miners getting more # mined per chain
* GREE is the only self sufficient green energy miner
* GREE has the lowest cost basis per asset mined among all of its competitors, meaning its weighted mining capacity is the highest.

&#x200B;

[Cost basis](https://preview.redd.it/ryc6udvwni871.png?width=1165&format=png&auto=webp&s=096f11fc49f990df63ef73098546e1d004c86f2f)

Now for revenue comparison between its two largest competitors:

|Total Revenue|EOY 2020|Q1 2021|
|:-|:-|:-|
|MARA|4.3 million|9.1 million|
|RIOT|12.1 million|23.2 million|
|GREE|20 million|11 million|

&#x200B;

With the current est. market cap of these two being:

* MARA has 2.6B market cap
* RIOT has 3.2B market cap

By extrapolation, we can confidently say GREE is somewhere in the $2.2 - 2.6 Billion market cap due to its prowess over MARA and tight contest to RIOT in regards to mining efficiency.

The merger deal will exchange *support*'s shareholder with a roughly \~8.6% or if you have 100 shares of *support*, you will get 8.6 shares of GREE in return. The current price of a *suppor\*\*t* share is $3.86 as of today.

This is the table that GREE showed during its presentation if you are bad at math:

[Price extrapolation](https://preview.redd.it/fsyidy5yni871.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=24ef64733c6ac521df3636158ef5464d5fc5ee57)

Can you see what the $2.5 billion market cap is equating to?

# $8 per share for support's stock, that is a 107% gap

With this sector of the market worth more a trillion dollar and even more, I am confident these mining companies will have a much higher ceiling than their current market cap.

Therefore, my PT's are:

\- Price target $8.5 after merger, no short squeeze no hype

\- Price target $17-25 with short squeeze (Yahoo saying 55% short, Ortex saying 72% short, 24M outstanding shares, 37% insiders, 50% institutions) -

[Shorts](https://preview.redd.it/qn0io7izni871.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=2395c69242ab74912d4de76faf8917774b4c0276)

\^ just ignore this because it's extremely difficult to squeeze nowadays.

[Summary](https://preview.redd.it/jo2uwx31oi871.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=82bb536c50379244889d8941a5e4acfdf1774db0)

The numbers you are required to remember: $29 million in cash. The reason why GREE wanted to absorb support isn't just because it is a tech company, it is because support has ample cash in hand, Atlas Holdings is smart, they know exactly which company they need to own and they chose the best one they could find in order to improve GREE's future balance sheet. Due to this, it is extremely unlikely that this merger deal will fall through, usually merger deals are made to expand corporations, however, support.com-Greenidge deal is to strap up in cash.

Edit: *support* was added to Russell microcap [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPRT/comments/oax3q0/sprt_was_added_to_the_russell_microcap_index/)

2021-07-01 02:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Awesome DD with just plain facts without any distraction or bloat. 

If you look at the green energy power plant that greenidge runs to mine their currency, this alone puts them ahead of the competition. The market cap post merger should therefor at least be 3B (which would still be lower than RIOT or MARA). Plus, Support also making money and expanding into fintech support ... This stock is just so much undervalued right now. 

Happy to ride this before the merger."
2021-06-30 23:43:28,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, what‚Äôs your position and when do you expect merger, early or late Q3? This support stock was pumping hard a while ago so wary of a p&d. 

Couple more questions if you can answer, what caused the crazy spike in March and why in the hell is thus shorted so much you think? That seems to be the real reason why many are invested

Also IV on options is very high, mm‚Äôs trying to eat your lunch"
2021-07-01 00:10:03,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow is a big day.  Checkmate. That chart has an inverted head and shoulders on the daily and a 3 month long cup and handle. Just the technical traders should be all over this if there are any of them left in this market. Lol

In March the reason why it spiked to 9.45 was because of the merger announcement, at least mainly because of that. I know a certain fintwit user is also in on it and that is their biggest long so I assume why the price stays above its previous 2.50 support level.

As for why there are so many shorts, I think either because Atlas Holdings themselves want to buy support for cheap (deal depends on 30 day avg price) or hedge funds bearish sentiment towards ‚Äúdigital asset‚Äù."

2021-07-01 03:45:26,wallstreetbets,Are shorts forced to cover before the merger goes through?
2021-06-30 23:52:08,wallstreetbets,Yeah no reverse split
2021-06-30 23:52:52,wallstreetbets,"Lots of big bears and big bulls, so buy shares, not contracts"
2021-06-30 23:57:42,wallstreetbets,"IV is the implied volatility. it's a value assigned to the contracts based on expected movement in the underlying. the implied volatility of a bluechip like apple will be low because +/- 3% on a day would be a big move for apple. but some 1B market cap meme stock will have a higher IV because 3% daily movements would be nothing, could go +/- 30% in a day

Say you want to bet that apple will go up 10% by this friday. Never gonna happen, the odds at the casino are very low = cheap premium

betting a meme stock will go up 10% this friday. could happen by 10am tomorrow. The casino knows this, therefore the IV is higher, so option buyers pay more premium for this bet"
2021-06-30 23:51:55,wallstreetbets,"In short, the stock will need to move a considerably large % before you even start to make money on options with high IV"
2021-06-30 23:58:45,wallstreetbets,Implied volatility is expensive as a MF and going options isn‚Äôt worth it
2021-06-30 23:59:11,wallstreetbets,Once any stock spikes the IV goes crazy
2021-07-01 08:43:49,wallstreetbets,I did too. Lol
2021-07-01 11:06:36,wallstreetbets,Looks like a modest increase in volume should get the price really moving
2021-07-01 00:11:50,wallstreetbets,"Ok I see. The next ‚Äúcatalyst‚Äù could be tomorrow which is PR announcing a date for the merger vote. Assuming it passes, merger completes 10-14 days later. Exciting as hell bro. 6k @ 4.02"
2021-07-01 00:45:49,wallstreetbets,What ticker am I yoloing?
2021-07-01 00:00:47,wallstreetbets,"like I said, they're losing revenue. whereas MARA and RIOT are making more than last year. revenue growth matters as well as the revenue, especially in this sector. why are they making less than last year?"
2021-07-01 16:11:06,wallstreetbets,"I don't know much about politics , buy according to state website , it passed assembly . Question is if gov signs it. They added more details to it if anything 

SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS: 

Section 1 declares the legislative findings. Section 2 places a moratorium on consolidated operations of proof-of- work based transaction validation methods. Section 3 requires completion of a comprehensive generic environmental impact statement by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Section 4 requires one-hundred and twenty days of public comment on the environmental impact statement and the holding of public hearings in eight regions across the state prior to final issuance. Section 5 requires issuance of a final generic environmental impact statement after close of the public comment and public hearing period. Section 6 provides definitions. Section 7 provides the effective date."
2021-07-01 06:36:50,wallstreetbets,"I saw it and just assumed it was legit, accepting it right away. you looked at it and checked it out and found out it wasn't. I really need to develop a more critical eye. well done."

2021-07-01 13:32:18,wallstreetbets,Very nice. When did you get in?
2021-07-01 07:25:46,wallstreetbets,No they are never forced. But eventually they have to buy back those shares.  I think they cover the first news we get about merger.  My opinion.
2021-07-01 00:38:21,wallstreetbets,"IV was high for $NEGG out of the gate on the 12.5c 7/16 today even when they were priced at $0.60, in post-GME era options aren't necessarily priced for upside tail risk lol that's why people yolo on FD's"

2021-06-30 23:53:17,wallstreetbets,Ok thank you.

2021-07-01 00:13:49,wallstreetbets,"yes but keep in mind tomorrow is the soonest possible date, it can as well be 3 weeks from now that they release PR"
2021-07-01 00:51:38,wallstreetbets,"SuPpoRT, capitalized letters. WSB doesn't like this ticker after the January influx of bots"
2021-07-01 00:04:15,wallstreetbets,The first number EOY means the whole year they made 20 million.  They made more than half of that 11 million in 1 quarter.  So they are actually on pace to get 44 million which would double their previous years revenue.  That's how I read it.
2021-07-01 16:34:33,wallstreetbets,Lmfao the BILL IS DEAD BUD. It got vetoed.  Democrats and IBEW vetoed it June 18. Cuomo is Democrat. I live an hour and half away from there. I've been there. They are buying 4 more plants in the same county. Dead. Bill is dead. Don't buy I don't really care. Sell. Heck short it for all I care. Did you even read the article. Lmfao

2021-07-01 00:24:09,wallstreetbets,ah I misunderstood then. that looks better on an individual level but still much lower growth than the others
2021-07-01 17:35:11,wallstreetbets,They do need to update their website that shows bill as active
2021-07-01 00:32:49,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Maybe cost of merger effecting it a little bit. Not real sure about that.

2021-06-30 22:48:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I was not expecting the jump either. I think there was a bit of a short squueze. I planned to dump half of my shares at 40 because I missed the opportunity on June 2. Yet I missed it again today. LOL!

There is still a large short %. As long as the company does not screw up I feel holding it longer term will be fine. I am terrible at trading anyway!"
2021-07-01 10:53:16,wallstreetbets,So instead did you just buy options for a $45 strike after the spike in traditional FOMO fashion?
2021-07-01 01:33:26,wallstreetbets,"Oh, there was a lot more than a bit of a short squeeze hahaha. Look at the volume throughout the day - it doesn't get 7x unless there's a squeeze. (Followed by a possible short selloff later in the day.)"
2021-07-01 11:00:01,wallstreetbets,"FOMO, I would not know anything about that ;-) 

No, I bought the $45 strike calls after the June 2 spike to \~$44. Just checked, on June 10. But on the way to $44 I did add some shares above my average price as my FOMO tendencies rule my trades."

2021-06-30 22:08:43,wallstreetbets,"Many years ago, there was a Mister Car Wash and Mister Oil Change in the town that I lived. I rarely made use of the car wash 'cuz I'm a slob, but the oil change place was super legit. The staff were on point.

They even had a popcorn machine for their clientele.

This is an add to my watch list."
2021-06-30 23:13:34,wallstreetbets,Hot damn I have a monthly membership at Mister and had no idea they were publicly traded.
2021-07-01 02:31:01,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, there are several around here.  Most of the time the wait is at their target but if you go on a busy day like fri/sat, its 10+.  They actually bought the ones near me a few years back and seem to run them pretty good.  I dont buy the subscription cause its per car ( fuck that ) plus i only go every other month.  Also, i see many police cars there, so i bet they have relationships with the local PDs ( this wasnt only at one location either, the four i have been to, seen different PDs at each one ).    With that said, IDK if +20 is a fair price, seems a bit high given revenue's of less than 1B, which right now its like 10x earnings.  They are being aggressive though and i would bet with the reopening, revenue will be going up."

2021-06-30 21:48:31,wallstreetbets,"Only adds 5 locations to their current 300+, but certainly this was in the works before the IPO. Wonder what else they have planned. They didn't waste any time putting their IPO capital to work."
2021-06-30 22:38:57,wallstreetbets,What do you guys think is a fair valuation for this stock?
2021-06-30 22:04:20,wallstreetbets,$MCW. They IPO'd yesterday.
2021-06-30 22:18:18,wallstreetbets,"I saw an interview clip of their CEO a few days ago. They sell subscriptions, like many other chains do and have 300+ locations. He also said their focus is giving a high-quality car wash while also getting people through in under 5 minutes.  


I have them on my watch list as well. Didn't expect them to have an acquisition the day after their IPO. Maybe they have big plans already for their \~$500m capital infusion."
2021-06-30 23:21:44,wallstreetbets,IPO'd yesterday.
2021-07-01 07:47:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, doing ape math, with $6bb market cap and 300+ locations, that's a value of about $20m each. If you figure they can have about 4 cars in various stages of the process at a time, their max throughput would be around 50 cars per hour.  


Let's say their locations average 25 cars per hour, 12 hours a day, 300 days a year, at $12 each. That would be an annual revenue of about $1m. No idea what their profit margin is, but that doesn't seem like enough to warrant a $20 share price.  


However... If they are aggressive about acquisitions and expansion, they could have a thousand or more locations in a matter of a few years. I have maybe 6 different car washes within a mile of my apartment. The market is there to support a dramatic expansion -- especially if they cut fleet deals with local government entities and businesses. They also only IPO'd about 13% of their shares, so they have plenty more they can sell to keep raising capital."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Forget The Trade Desk, Buy PubMatic PubMatic is a small-cap growth stock in the quite quickly growing adtech space, which may be facing further tailwinds from the reopening and trends such as CTV.

Its valuation is lower than others in this space such as market darling The Trade Desk, while also growing faster.

Large growth prospects and a reasonable valuation, combined with a low absolute market cap, provide a recipe for a successful investment.

Buy potential multi-baggers while they‚Äôre small.



Investment Thesis

One of the core tenets of growth investing is a company‚Äôs relatively small market cap in light of a potentially large long-term opportunity. A small company with a differentiated technology or product in a large market could deliver supercharged returns if it keeps growing.
This may exactly be the case with PubMatic (PUBM). The company operates an adtech platform, has a reasonable valuation, is growing fast, and has the relatively small market cap that growth investors would look for.
I would contrast this stock with The Trade Desk (TTD). While they‚Äôre not exactly competitors, both operate in the adtech space. However, The Trade Desk has the opposite characteristics: while the company also reports respectable growth, it already has a much larger market cap and a high P/S valuation.
Put differently, though, the investment thesis is that potentially PubMatic could replicate on the sell-side of this market what The Trade Desk has accomplished (both as a business and as double digit-bagger on the stock market) on the buy-side.

Company overview

As indicated, PubMatic operates in the adtech space. The company provides a sell-side cloud infrastructure platform purpose-built for digital, real-time programmatic advertising. As such, the company should benefit from general ad spend growth as well as some of the higher-growth areas in this space such as programmatic CTV (connected TV). PubMatic also expects some acceleration tailwinds from the reopening.
In¬†succinct terms:

PubMatic has created a sell-side ad tech platform that leverages data-driven algorithms and tools to help content publishers and app developers maximize the value of their ad inventory.

The reasoning behind such an infrastructure-driven approach is that advertising is inherently data-intensive, and also real-time. Hence, PubMatic can deliver increased value (such as higher revenue for publishers and higher ROI for buyers), and also innovate faster, by controlling the full stack from hardware to software. This also results in a cost advantage.
The alternative approach is using public cloud infrastructure, which only allows for controlling the software stack.
PubMatic also claims it benefits from consolidation of ad budgets on fewer sell-side platforms, resulting in increased market share. This occurs through Supply Path Optimizations or SPOs. As evidence for this trend, PubMatic disclosed that revenue from those arrangements nearly doubled in Q1.

Lastly, to come back to the term ‚Äúsell-side‚Äù. This can be contrasted to The Trade Desk, which is a demand-side or buy-side platform. In simple terms, the buy-side are those who buy advertising inventory, while the sell-side are those who offer ad space, anywhere on the internet. As such, the thesis really is that PubMatic may become (both as company and as a stock) on the sell-side what The Trade Desk has become on the buy-side.

Q1 results

In Q1, PubMatic reported $43.6M revenue, up 54% YoY. In particular, mobile and omnichannel video grew 83%, and represented 63% of total revenue. CTV grew 55% QoQ. Gross margin also increased from 65% to 72% due to increased utilization. This signals a scalable business.
PubMatic‚Äôs accelerated growth over the last year is also evidenced by its increased TTM net retention, which has expanded from 112% to 130%, which is best-in-class for growth companies in general.

Guidance

PubMatic has guided for 33% growth for the year.
While this implies a slowdown, some part of it does seem like sandbagging or conservative guidance: as discussed, the net retention was 130% in Q1, and growth in mobile and video also grew markedly faster than the overall business.

Valuation

PubMatic‚Äôs valuation should be considered compelling. At the stock‚Äôs current ~$40 price, the forward P/S stands at ~10x, which is over 3x cheaper than The Trade Desk. Obviously, the bullish case would be that given that both operate in the same market, PubMatic could deliver similar growth as the former, which would result in both long-term stock and valuation expansion.
Although PubMatic certainly does not yet have same multi-year track record of elevated revenue growth yet as The Trade Desk, this stark difference in valuation arguably well offsets potential execution risks. At least in Q1, PubMatic was growing faster than The Trade Desk.

Risks

PubMatic‚Äôs growth has accelerated since COVID-19, and the company also expects continued tailwinds from the reopening, which should result in increased ad spend. However, a risk would be if growth would slow down to pre-pandemic levels; obviously, the best growth stocks, including The Trade Desk, are able to sustain elevated growth for years.
Another potential risk are some of the recent and ongoing changes in the ad space, including changes in Apple‚Äôs (AAPL) policy and the phasing out of third-party cookies. However, PubMatic reports that the majority of its revenue comes from different identifiers than those two. As such, PubMatic actually views this is a competitive advantage, similar to how The Trade Desk has been¬†boasting about¬†how the Open Internet will prevail over the walled gardens. PubMatic is in fact investing in a portfolio of alternative solutions to the third-party cookie, including The Trade Desk‚Äôs UID 2.0 as well as Google‚Äôs (GOOG) (GOOGL)¬†Privacy Sandbox¬†(which includes the contested FloC).

Note that The Trade Desk and PubMatic are not really competitors but rather partners, as The Trade Desk is a demand side platform. PubMatic says it is integrated with around 100 such platforms.
A last risk I found was that although PubMatic especially touts its infrastructure, the company nevertheless seems to get more mixed reviews (i.e. a lower rating than TTD). This could imply it still has some way to go to truly become best-in-class.

Primer on ads and cookies

This section serves for those who aren‚Äôt all too up-to-date on some of the terms used here.
As I would describe it, the core issues stem from privacy concerns regarding (third-party) cookies and tracking. This is leading to the phasing out of those cookies (now planned for 2023 by Chrome). However, this causes issues for the digital advertising market, which relies on targeted ads to increase their efficiency.
As such, alternative, supposedly more privacy-friendly, tracking solutions are being introduced. One of the most well-known is The Trade Desk‚Äôs UID 2.0. Google, for its part, is backing on a collection of a few dozen of APIs, which it calls Privacy Sandbox. One of those is the controversial ‚ÄúFloC‚Äù, even though it does (more or less) achieve its goal to provide privacy without sacrificing targeting accuracy.
Another point of dichotomy is regarding what some like to call the Open Internet vs. the walled gardens. The latter are the big ad platforms such as Google, Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).
The gist is that those walled gardens have a privileged position given that they have an enormous amount of first-party data. Hence, they could survive the phasing out of third-party cookies quite unscathed.
Some claim, for example, that it is in Google's interest to phase out those cookies, which could put Google at a competitive advantage as others would lose the ability to serve targeted ads.
However, one might note that this dichotomy isn‚Äôt all that clear. For example, both Roku (ROKU) and Unity (U) (and likely plenty others) certainly wouldn‚Äôt be considered walled gardens among the likes of Google and Facebook. Nevertheless, both companies have said that given their own first-party data, they deem themselves to be quite unaffected by those changes in the ad landscape.
Lastly, given the observation that there are so many alternative tracking solutions being developed, which may or may not conserve privacy, ultimately there may be relatively little tangible changes in the ad landscape. As such, the bottom line may be that the recent rally by the likes of The Trade Desk (due to Google‚Äôs Privacy Sandbox delay) is overblown.

Investor Takeaway

PubMatic offers a compelling proposition, both with its full-stack technology as well as with accelerated business results. In general, the company operates in the growing digital advertising market, and by being at the forefront with its technology and innovation, seems to be well-positioned for market share growth as well.
The company has reported high growth, expanded margins, and a high 130% net retention in Q1. PubMatic is also capitalizing on the latest trends such as CTV, which grew 55% sequentially. While no stocks are risk-free, these are definitely signs that the company is able to capitalize on the growth opportunity in its adtech space.
Just as importantly, compared to other growth stocks I have covered, both the company‚Äôs market cap and P/S valuation are rather low for growth stocks. That implies the risk is reduced, while the potential upside could be significant.
Hence, bottom line is that PubMatic does not even have to exactly replicate The Trade Desk‚Äôs performance to deliver solid or even significant long-term investor returns. As I said about another small company a while ago,¬†Sumo Logic¬†(SUMO): buy potential multi-baggers while they‚Äôre small (and cheap)."

No update on Friday, I have some plumbing for my sisters house to do. The next update will be Sunday night. (Hopefully before 8pm)

Only so many blankets to be had. We are starting to see this action this week, though it's not showing in the the price action yet. $STAR is still finding its support and has started to consolidate around 20.40-20.60 this week.

&#x200B;

Financial Disclosure: I purchased an additional 50 - July 16 20 calls during Monday dip.

&#x200B;

On Monday, Ortex data showed a net 253k new shorts added into the market. However, on Tuesday we saw a net -133k shorts covered. You can see the data below:

The data for Wednesday is still neutral overall. However, not all data has been submitted as of this moment.

[\(Source: Ortex.com\) Preliminary Data](https://preview.redd.it/u2cdi2aerh871.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=e57b95e5657eba84bb3912aa9dde1787ae6bc218)

&#x200B;

The most interesting thing that happened this week thus far was Tuesday after market. As you can see in the screengrab below. There was a single purchase of 950k shares. Now this could be a large cover of a short position or an investment firm increasing or starting their position on $STAR. We should find out by end of week from the data if nearly 1 million shares are returned.

Today, marks the end of the 2nd quarter for Mutual Funds. Now they generally submit data within 30 days to regulators. However, their websites get updates even before. I will be keeping an eye on them for updates to gain insight on how much they have increased their holdings."

2021-07-01 16:07:31,wallstreetbets,"Feel like net positives are a rarity (other than theta gang) and even the positives are arguable in terms of if they have a better overall return. The ones that truly exploded are lotteries. 

My stock positions over the last 4 years: +250% ish overall.

My options over the last few years:
About a -80% or -30k in real money. 

If I never played option I would‚Äôve been a great bull market investor - I know the return is thanks to overall market trends but at least I didn‚Äôt paper hand and had plenty of good picks. Unfortunately, a decent chunk of my returns went to cover the option losses lol. I mean I‚Äôm still up plenty overall but it‚Äôs pain."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"This is not a full DD. This is a post saying do not ****ing buy Krispy Kreme stock - this is a sunken ship. It was taken private in 2016 at a valuation of 1.35Bil. Tomorrow at IPO they are pricing shares at $17 for a valuation of 2.72 billion. Really? It's doubled in a 5 year period? No. It hasn't, this is JAB holdings realizing they bought something they probably shouldn't have, milked it for all it's worth and trying to scrap it for more then it paid for.

What are some RED FLAGS you might ask? Take a look at the S-1...

Of the last three fiscal years, it's only lost money in the last three. Said otherwise, 100% of the time of the required amount they need to show they have lost money. FY19-FY20 Organic revenue growth of 1.2%.. That won't even beat inflation. On the bright side- bottom-line was negative. They went from only losing 37 million in 2019 to losing 64 million in 2020. I didn't look to much more in-depth at the S-1 to see the valuation even though below the $21-24 they initially were trying to get.

It also has a billion in debt it didn't have when it went private.. curious...

&#x200B;

Don't be a fool, don't buy Krispy Kreme. The fresh donuts are delicious, but the stock is a no-go.

2021-06-30 22:00:40,wallstreetbets,"I disagree with you on one item. Their donuts are not delicious. They are fucking gross, they are too sweet and lack flavor, unless sugar is a flavor. 

But hey if you get a vaccine you can get some free donuts. I‚Äôm holding a lot of SENS so that‚Äôs good."
2021-07-01 17:03:54,wallstreetbets,"For all of you who are saying I am wrong after a single day‚Ä¶ man. I really would recommend you read, ‚ÄúThe intelligent investor‚Äù by Benjamin Graham.

No thanks KK"
2021-06-30 22:37:01,wallstreetbets,All I see is full DD and buy Krispy Kreme. Gotta love selective reading. Saves so much time and money.
2021-06-30 22:37:58,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, though. They have that weird American white bread texture and taste, where it's like dry and spongey with no chew or crust to it, and the only flavor in the bread itself is sweet and flour.

The only thing here that's crispy is the fuckin' sock that the spank spunk they call icing should have gone into instead."

2021-06-30 22:40:23,wallstreetbets,I mean as of date this sub loves investing into shit tier stocks and pumping them. This shit suits it perfectly.
2021-06-30 22:40:27,wallstreetbets,OMG. I was literally just considering posting a similar take on this. Here‚Äôs a franchise that peaked like 8 years ago. Actually outgrew itself and has been on the decline ever since. Do NOT buy this. It‚Äôs a distraction to going full ape on something that matters üòÜ

2021-06-30 22:49:05,wallstreetbets,I think they did free doughnuts to vaccine card ppl. Their most loyal customers are aftaid to go outside.
2021-06-30 22:49:46,wallstreetbets,Dont tell me what to do im buying
2021-06-30 22:49:56,wallstreetbets,Is this the first stock we short as a subreddit?
2021-06-30 22:50:10,wallstreetbets,they would make a lot more if they sold whole milk too to balance out all the sugar in those donuts
2021-06-30 22:50:11,wallstreetbets, Mo
2021-06-30 22:51:35,wallstreetbets,So will these be the first one in a long time where we look at puts as a strategy? I want in lol

2021-06-30 22:52:46,wallstreetbets,They would make a lot more if their locations were better. closest one to me is way out of the way. closest dunkin is basically right down the road. i love krispy kreme but fuck man i aint drivin 20 minutes or upcharging myself 200% on doordash for breakfast.

2021-06-30 23:11:06,wallstreetbets,Stock market 2021 is just millennial junior high companies ruling the market. We can‚Äôt afford houses so this is our revenge.
2021-06-30 23:11:17,wallstreetbets,Preach brotha. It‚Äôs a bunch of private equity guys thinking they can cash in on retarded retail investors. Sad thing is they might be right

The choice is yours"

2021-06-30 23:22:20,wallstreetbets,But their donuts are so scrumptious
2021-06-30 23:22:34,wallstreetbets,"Funny you mention how $17/share is high.  The mainstream articles talked about how $17 was on the low-low end and it should have been $21-24.  Guess the big players are also shorting this POS, lol."

2021-06-30 23:31:33,wallstreetbets,It's the latest trend. Losers IPO as a last hoorah to steal everyone's money before closing the doors or selling the business.  ARKX  is the only real quality IPO I've seen this year.
2021-06-30 23:34:04,wallstreetbets,"Also, while their donuts are good and better than DD, they did jack up the price to almost $2/donut. I don't know about you, but that is pretty steep."
2021-06-30 23:36:37,wallstreetbets,KRISPY KREME IS ANOTHER GAMESTOP
2021-06-30 23:37:24,wallstreetbets,Has anyone been to a Krispy Kreme recently? They really shut themselves off a lot of market share of the fast food breakfast industry by only offering donuts. Their coffee selection is meek at best. Only thing they have going for them is good donuts. Get into breakfast sandwiches and better coffee selections. That‚Äôs what sells
2021-06-30 23:38:26,wallstreetbets,One of the only good IPOs this year is RBLX. Rest are lame and bagholder material
2021-06-30 23:38:46,wallstreetbets,I'm going to buy a baker's dozen shares. Like i did last time they were public.
2021-06-30 23:39:34,wallstreetbets,I don't like $DNUT anyway. They don't come in ZERO calories.....
2021-06-30 23:39:55,wallstreetbets,Early rule I set myself as an investor is not to get involved with IPOs after losing a bunch on Bumble. Since discovered they‚Äôre the part of the investment cycle where the angel investors cash out by pumping the stock
2021-06-30 23:40:13,wallstreetbets,JAB can eat D(eez)NUT(s)
2021-06-30 23:42:33,wallstreetbets,Honestly if they threw in some donuts with the shares I'd yolo in a heartbeat.
2021-06-30 23:43:00,wallstreetbets,"Thanks good sir, I do take issue with your claim of delicious doughnuts though. Do they hide the goods one in the back? Do I need to ask for Paco?"
2021-06-30 23:44:01,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll buy a donut but not the stock.
2021-06-30 23:47:35,wallstreetbets,They're busting out poor Krispy Kreme? Oh no! üí¶ü§£

2021-07-01 00:08:00,wallstreetbets,"This stock already went tits-up once, a ton of locations closed, etc. Even after it went private again, they haven't made a profit. Gonna sit it out this time too."

2021-07-01 00:17:34,wallstreetbets,Fair value is somewhere between $8.75 and $9.25?
2021-07-01 00:19:03,wallstreetbets,"I can‚Äôt think of a shittier donut than a Krispy Kreme.  The last two times I tried one my bites exponentially decayed in size and enthusiasm, and I threw out the last half uneaten, while thinking a little acid reflux might clear my pallet.

Edit: This is coming from a man who can leisurely consume an 8-pack of chocolate frosted Entemann‚Äôs full sized donuts in under 30 minutes without realizing it, and will not only inhale almost any non-jelly Dunkin‚Äô Donut, but will even happily eat those plain brown boomer donuts with coffee."

2021-07-01 00:40:41,wallstreetbets,Socialize losses and privatize gains tbh. Many hedge funds& private equity &private credit funds will try and capitalize on the hot ipo market.

2021-07-01 00:51:42,wallstreetbets,I like KK. I‚Äôve driven 3 hours to Iowa just to get a Donut. Will support because I like their products not because I believe in the current business stats.
2021-07-01 00:53:53,wallstreetbets,Appreciate the warning.
2021-07-01 00:55:23,wallstreetbets,Loading up on puts for this one.
2021-07-01 01:00:21,wallstreetbets,I agree - seems like a good stock for puts on when options go live
2021-07-01 01:02:18,wallstreetbets,"i mean amazon had set way more money on fire by the time the ipo‚Äôed. maybe your conclusion is right. looking only at historical accounting profit is really really shitty analysis. 

they generated plenty of cash flow from operations in every year. i‚Äôm too lazy to dig through the notes, but there could be a good argument that a lot of their operating expenses + capex was temporary. so they‚Äôll throw off even more cash in the future

this DD is an A on the ape curve but an f otherwise sorry bro"
2021-07-01 01:02:54,wallstreetbets,In a time of pumps it's nice to see someone pointing out a dump.

From the looks of it, they arrange with financial institutions to pay back their AR in 180 day windows. This isn‚Äôt classified as debt but KK does pay a fee to effectively‚Ä¶ borrow access to money for 180 days to pay their bills. 

KK only makes about .02 - .04 on each $1 sold. 

I‚Äôm going to bet against this one big time."
2021-07-01 01:06:29,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ people are getting fatter every year. Donuts seem to correlate pretty closely with that. My bet is on the American people‚Ä¶.. having terrible diets and getting fatter by eating donuts. Myself included.

2021-07-01 01:15:44,wallstreetbets,Didn't they go public before in the past? Pretty sure they had to eventually go private. I guess they're taking a dip in the public pool again.
2021-07-01 01:16:20,wallstreetbets,Bought air b n b for way too much as well

2021-07-01 01:37:57,wallstreetbets,"As a bit of anecdotal to inform thinking, Krispy Kreme rolled out into Aus and within a few years they went from having their own stores and shop fronts to being sold exclusively at 7/11s as late night snacks for drunk people who don't care they've probably been in the cabinet for 3 days. Truely garbage"
2021-07-01 01:39:40,wallstreetbets,Have they outlined a plan for what the money will be used for or are they too lazy to try to look legit?

This seems like a perfect opportunity to buy some puts - wait for it to pop up and then hopefully it trades sideways for a minute to bring down IV for an entry point before it starts dumping. I'd be afraid to straight up short it since nothing makes any sense anymore and this will probably reach $50 on the backs of retail's extra chromosomes..."
2021-07-01 01:46:12,wallstreetbets,The amount of sugar they used in their donuts won't help the stonk go up.

I know that they expanded too quickly originally and I think that it was a great deal of their problem. There seem to be less locations now, so I thought they may have strengthened through not being so widespread.

The hot donuts are indescribable. They literally melt in your mouth."
2021-07-01 02:25:57,wallstreetbets,"I love the donuts.

They were also growing huge internationally about 10 years ago.

However, while traveling in Japan 2 years ago before corona hit (I go quite often), all the stores that used to have long lines to get in were dead empty with barely any customers. 

  
Same goes for Coldstone Creamery. Used to be super popular, now all the stores are gone."
2021-07-01 02:30:20,wallstreetbets,I knew one of the larger shareholders. He was so pissed when it went private. Amassed his fortune in the fashion business not really sure how much he lost. But it was significant enough for him to mention it.
2021-07-01 02:31:00,wallstreetbets,The doughnuts literally got smaller after they went private. I‚Äôll buy some shares when they get ~12% larger.
2021-07-01 02:34:23,wallstreetbets,So your saying squeeze. Lol
2021-07-01 02:37:18,wallstreetbets,Melvin probably should have shorted this instead.
2021-07-01 02:39:11,wallstreetbets,"Weird. $GME was at $17 on Jan 4th, and in ***6 months*** it has grown to 11x that, so I don't know why you think 2x in 5 ***years*** for Krispy Kreme is impossible."
2021-07-01 02:40:39,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like an opportunity to buy some puts, with the donuts atleast."
2021-07-01 02:42:07,wallstreetbets,Any one wants to bag hold donuts? They go bad pretty fast and they get hard with time
2021-07-01 02:42:12,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt get any of the $DNUT.
2021-07-01 02:46:50,wallstreetbets,I read this and I was like wait where am I? Oh right WSB. This place single handedly raised GME and AMC from the dead. Their glazed donuts are amazing. I‚Äôm gonna pick me up some $DNUTs then buying a box of glazed to watch the stock price flop around.
2021-07-01 02:47:15,wallstreetbets,"This is going to come us as trending! Without sentiment, someone‚Äôs going yolo"
2021-07-01 02:52:55,wallstreetbets,But I like donuts like I like my crayons
2021-07-01 02:59:17,wallstreetbets,Every company is looking to do a gme. I say we fucking short it lol and do the reversal
2021-07-01 03:02:29,wallstreetbets,I was waiting for the tldr to be calls for next weeküòÇ
2021-07-01 03:14:51,wallstreetbets,So buy puts once the ipo price peaks and they are available
2021-07-01 03:15:16,wallstreetbets,I know that doughnuts have sugar‚Ä¶ and I know that sugar has a crash‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to not buy IPO.
2021-07-01 03:16:09,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs so good tho
2021-07-01 03:17:09,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-07-01 03:19:20,wallstreetbets,"I just really like the donuts,  I mean stonk..."
2021-07-01 03:27:08,wallstreetbets,"Everyone in here is going to short this, I think HF's will squeeze us"
2021-07-01 03:27:54,wallstreetbets,Dunkin Do Nots
2021-07-01 03:28:48,wallstreetbets,Then short it
2021-07-01 03:29:08,wallstreetbets,"Not a good one? Lost money 3/3 years?

Fuck it all in"
2021-07-01 03:33:45,wallstreetbets,"I work for a large grocery store chain in a very populated area. We used to have Krispy Kreme deliver doughnuts to our stores in my area. They usually didn‚Äôt sell and the next time the guy came they took out the expired ones and replaced them with new ones. About a year and a half ago they realized it wasn‚Äôt profitable and they stopped delivering to all the stores in my area. Their closest location is about 20 miles away, so it‚Äôs not like they are competing directly with their own location by selling here, and they aren‚Äôt driving an hour out of their way to deliver those donuts to us. They still do store deliveries in some areas, but they couldn‚Äôt keep sales up enough in my area(again, a populated area and a very successful grocery chain with plenty of customers) to make deliveries profitable.
I wouldn‚Äôt buy it‚Ä¶"
2021-07-01 03:34:47,wallstreetbets,"I going long on krispy for the mere fact that this appears on wsb, and y‚Äôall against it."
2021-07-01 03:35:05,wallstreetbets,"I always find IPOs have a run up instantly which you can‚Äôt profit from unless you managed to get shares pre IPO. 

Then the insiders/Staff who have been given shares before the IPO all sell and the price goes down. 

That‚Äôs just my opinion from looking at IPOs 
Coinbase is a good example of what I just said"
2021-07-01 03:38:36,wallstreetbets,"Is this going to be the bizzaro meme stock, WSB folks shorting it?"
2021-07-01 03:39:02,wallstreetbets,I do like the stock though
2021-07-01 03:40:57,wallstreetbets,I came across a KK while traveling. Don‚Äôt have one locally. It was legit PACKED. Line out the door. Made em fresh right in front of me and best donut I‚Äôve ever had. Idk shit about their valuation but their product is top notch.
2021-07-01 03:42:52,wallstreetbets,I remember in college my Business Management class always used a Krispy Kreme case study to show exactly how not to run a business.
2021-07-01 03:44:00,wallstreetbets,"Why are you trying to even do DD and estimate fair fundamental value, in times when, well everything is in a bubble. 

If anything, i would rather expect the already upsided $17 to quickly double in the coming weeks to even more ridiculous valuations, heck, why not triple from already overpriced levels. It is 2021 FED induced crazy la-la-land afterall and fundamentals have little meaning."
2021-07-01 03:45:20,wallstreetbets,But their donuts are so good!
2021-07-01 03:49:03,wallstreetbets,Krispy Kreme seems to have had a steady decline in popularity over the last 2 decades especially here in SoCal.  The one by my university closed many years ago and there wasnt much competition near by.  And now there's been a rise to more trendy donut shops that eat up market share.
2021-07-01 03:49:32,wallstreetbets,"Their donuts are OK fresh. Only thing unique about them is they're super fluffy. Which means you get less donut. I want a deep fried fucking brick, God damn it."
2021-07-01 03:57:15,wallstreetbets,Krispy Kreme donuts are not that good bro
2021-07-01 03:58:28,wallstreetbets,This is a last ditch effort for those donut fucks. Let them die
2021-07-01 04:05:18,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm gonna be honest, Krispy Kreme is a great stock. I haven‚Äôt been to a single one yet that doesn‚Äôt have lines out the door. More and more brick mortar stores are opening. Franchising at a high. I‚Äôm in."
2021-07-01 04:07:32,wallstreetbets,Krispy Kreme deep fried and sugar coated their financials last time they were a public company. ..must mean it‚Äôs time to do a yolo
2021-07-01 04:09:35,wallstreetbets,they be getting rich giving free donuts to the vaccinated people
2021-07-01 04:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Krispy Kreme opened a new location near me, was going to be the second one in my entire state. They built this brand new beautiful store from the ground up. A year or so later and the place is completely shut down. That‚Äôs enough reason for me to not buy their stock"
2021-07-01 04:15:25,wallstreetbets,"Don't tell me what to do

*Loses entire life's savings on a meme stock*"
2021-07-01 04:17:38,wallstreetbets,is there some hype or some kind of movement to buy Krispy Kreme stock?? just curious I don‚Äôt come here often and I know you guys are all fucking goobers
2021-07-01 04:19:51,wallstreetbets,"In Burbank, CA, the drive-thru line for the local Krispy Kreme regularly extends all the way out of the immediate Krispy parking lot, snakes its way over to the gigantic outdoor mall parking lot's main road, around two corners, and then all the way out of the mall entrance and on to the main thoroughfare going past the mall, creating a dangerous traffic jam of parked cars blocking a 45mph road.

And you're telling me this stock is a loser??? Uh....ok..."
2021-07-01 04:22:12,wallstreetbets,"so tell me, can i short an IPO before its even out?

i wanna short the fuck out of this but i fear by the time its possible on any of the regular platforms its already dead."
2021-07-01 04:32:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah don't buy, I swear they're disappearing. Though donuts are good, so dump all the money"
2021-07-01 04:33:17,wallstreetbets,Can you repeat but only using emojis or words a toddler would understand?
2021-07-01 04:39:55,wallstreetbets,So what he‚Äôs saying is buy donuts? Ape confused?!?
2021-07-01 05:01:32,wallstreetbets,So you're saying to buy... Damnit I'm in
2021-07-01 05:03:58,wallstreetbets,"As for me, I do not like the stock."
2021-07-01 05:09:44,wallstreetbets,Reverse this DD duh!!
2021-07-01 05:10:57,wallstreetbets,Good post good comments. Refreshing to see this!
2021-07-01 05:16:03,wallstreetbets,"I've LITERALLY been at this shit for less than 2 months (Not only on WSB, but in general).  The ONLY thing that I would do (If I had the $$ to back it up) would be selling puts.  There is NO way that a company that's HEMORRAGING money (after going BACK private 5 years ago) MAKES money.  No matter how popular the donuts are!

Don't get me wrong - I LOVE me some KK donuts - every once in a while!  But it's probably been 3 months since I've had one)  But even as a smooth brained ape who's only been doing this whole thing for just short of 2 months, \* I \* KNOW that this is a BAD idea, unless you're short selling, or selling puts.

As should be obvious by what I've already said - this is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!!  I am NOT a financial advisor - just saying what SHOULD be plain to see... CO goes public, goes back private - attempts to go public again.  ONLY reason I can see, is ALL those investors that paid for it to go BACK private are SICK of paying the bills, and want their $ back - hence, the RE-IPO."
2021-07-01 05:23:23,wallstreetbets,Remember when places where serving burgers on Krispy Kreme donut buns - ‚Äòmerica

2021-07-01 06:07:14,wallstreetbets,I thought Dunkin was the only one selling donuts.
2021-07-01 06:10:12,wallstreetbets,"I bought a krispy kreme original and ate it earlier, should I call a doctor or a stock broker?"
2021-07-01 06:13:44,wallstreetbets,A wise investor buys when others are selling...
2021-07-01 06:13:58,wallstreetbets,It sounds like good business for them. Lol
2021-07-01 06:15:16,wallstreetbets,"Good DD, so basically they are trying to dump it to break even (get their money back and pay the debt). üëéüèª"
2021-07-01 06:15:41,wallstreetbets,"When even WSB figures out that companies that lose money every year but keep doubling in price are overvalued, then you know we're near the top of the bubble."
2021-07-01 06:18:16,wallstreetbets,Good  dd
2021-07-01 06:19:53,wallstreetbets,"They've been hemorrhaging stores left and right for awhile now, not sure why they're valuation is that high."
2021-07-01 06:20:17,wallstreetbets,So now WSB wants to create a short squeeze and make money out of it üòÇüòÇ. As if AMC is worth it‚Äôs valuation.

2021-07-01 06:46:55,wallstreetbets,Dunkin Donuts beat Krispy Kreme in my area because they had better coffee. Sure doughnuts are a tasty treat but customers want decent coffee more than they want fancy doughnuts
2021-07-01 06:47:48,wallstreetbets,Stock no.  Donuts YES!!  The hot ones are to die for.  Good thing cause all that sugar will kill ya.  Taste good tho.
2021-07-01 06:48:56,wallstreetbets,So buy puts is what you‚Äôre saying??

2021-07-01 06:54:46,wallstreetbets,"The heart squeeze has not been squooze.  You can try to cointain the collective investors from investing, but because this is a known entity that we see every day like an AMC theater or a Gamestomp, there are going to be investors throwing down their money on it.  I mean people will start believing anything.  But then you have thought creep like. .  . What if they sell so many shares they get out of debt like AMC?  What if they start buying out their competition like AMC? Whst if we squeeze these institutional investors who are actually retail investors who are shorting out of their money? Trying to tell people what to do vs putting money where your mouth determines how effective the DD is.  All it takes is someone throwing 1 million YOLO on DNUT and this post will be overuled."
2021-07-01 06:54:59,wallstreetbets,So yolo puts. Got it. Thanks. I'll see you in Valhalla.
2021-07-01 07:06:25,wallstreetbets,What fresh donuts? I haven't seen a KK actually turn on their Hot sign in years.

2021-07-01 07:10:42,wallstreetbets,"I used to work with Krispy Kreme management before they were acquired.

2021-07-01 07:22:00,wallstreetbets,Buy the Donut not the Stock.

2021-07-01 08:09:08,wallstreetbets,That debt was taken for paying the huge bonuses for the private equity managers and not used for investing in the company. Then this company is being made public so that retail can take over the debt since brand is popular. Expect hedge to pump the stock a bit to get retail excited.

It would be good to figure out why JAB wants the liquidity.

JAB is a competitor that I'd rather try to be sitting on their side of the table."
2021-07-01 08:50:29,wallstreetbets,"Not only this, but I legitimately don‚Äôt like the way JAB is running the company. You go to Krispy Kreme for glazed donuts, not for whatever frosted bullshit they‚Äôre hyping up that week. If I wanted a cupcake with a hole in the middle, I‚Äôd go to Dunkin Donuts. Krispy Kreme used to produce mainly their glazed donuts on as large of a scale as possible, so that a dozen would cost ~$7. Less than 4 years later and it‚Äôs already over $10."

2021-07-01 09:50:35,wallstreetbets,"1. Krispy Kreme donuts are disgusting. It's a congealed grease ring smothered in diabetes. The only thought I have when I have tried them is ""Why would someone do this to themself""

2. This just signifies how extremely inflated the stock market is right now, IPOs are severely overvalued across the board, thanks in part to the SPAC fad. With all that debt and free money from suckers flying around the market, I can't blame KK for trying to cash in on the mania and raise some capital with their financials as they are but they will not be taking any of my money."
2021-07-01 09:50:57,wallstreetbets,You guys do realize that it'll actually rocket now that you're spreading all this FUD? The market is such a coin flip most of the time. Fundamentals don't make a lick of difference in too many tickers.

2021-07-01 10:27:31,wallstreetbets,Backed up my guy feeling about this stock. Thanks. I'm steering well clear
2021-07-01 10:27:53,wallstreetbets,Hurts Donuts > Krispy Kreme
2021-07-01 10:33:43,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree lots of red flags, and I would only buy with the utmost caution.

However, **I may be a bit bullish on them at the right price.**

WHY THO? Y'all donut apes forgetting about the cookie cats: **Krispy Kreme owns Insomnia Cookies.** If y'all don't know Insomnia, they are the dopest, gooy-est, sugary, floury tendies that money can buy...... oh, and they deliver to apes like us. Insomnia had 54% of 2020 revenue come from e-commerce. KK had 18%.We don't know how big Insomnia's revenue is (from S-1: ""\[KK\] consolidates the financial results of Insomnia""), but this ape has a couple wrinkles in his brain to do some quick math:

&#x200B;

* Insomnia sold 65 million cookies in 2020. KK sold 1.3B donuts, or about 20x the donuts vs cookies.
* However, Insomnia charges $21 for a basic dozen cookies, vs $7.99 for a dozen at KK. We'll call this 3x the price for easy math.
* 20 / 3 = KK has \~6.7x more revenue than Insomnia, or 13% of revenue is Insomnia.
* This ape thinks is a low estimate because it doesn't take delivery or shipping revenue into account, so let's say that Insomonia Cookies are \~15% of $DNUT revenue.

Why is this important to other apes? Because Insomnia Cookies are going to the moon, even if the donuts aren't. From DNUT's investor presentation: 

>Insomnia Cookies opened 17 locations in 2020 and has plans to open 30 stores in 2021. The company locations offer delivery up to 30 minutes. The company plans to offer next-day delivery in the future, covering a larger percentage of the U.S. market.

e-Commerce capabilities also give a company ability to drive lower margins than 100% traditional brick and mortar. And with KK is investing heavily into their most e-Commerce heavy, growing brand (Insomnia Cookies), this could help growth both their revenue growth and bottom-line performance.

**TL;DR:** Apes buy the DNUT but  hold for the cookie.

2021-07-01 10:39:08,wallstreetbets,anyone buying puts on Krispy Kreme?
2021-07-01 10:45:59,wallstreetbets,If they sell them through school fund raisers that should say something in itself. That‚Äôs the only way I can buy them and even then I don‚Äôt want them.

2021-07-01 10:50:02,wallstreetbets,The gods have spoken! Krisy Kreme is now an enemy of WSB!

2021-07-01 11:43:50,wallstreetbets,should we short Krispy Kreme?
2021-07-01 11:43:55,wallstreetbets,Local donuts are always better. Kk doesn't even make them on location anymore.
2021-07-01 11:44:44,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll keep taking their free glazed donuts though
2021-07-01 11:46:12,wallstreetbets,How do I short them before they go public?

2021-07-01 12:08:53,wallstreetbets,Never cared about new ipo. The amount of times the went straight up and never came back down is low compare to the normal dipping a few weeks to month later
2021-07-01 12:11:44,wallstreetbets,We buying puts then?
2021-07-01 12:11:48,wallstreetbets,"based on their product along its a HARD pass

Carbs and Sugar are basically the Smoking and Bacon Fat of the 1960's.  

Of ALL donuts, Id go to Shipleys first, maybe even a DD but no fucking way im ever going to a Crispy Creme.  Its a circle of diabetes."
2021-07-01 12:14:47,wallstreetbets,"In Santa Fe NM the only Krispy Kreme shop closed about a year ago and last I checked on Google its a sleep number store.

Off topic but it does imply the business isn't doing the best with people trying to somewhat eat better."

2021-07-01 12:19:42,wallstreetbets,"Sadly even with info like this their stock will run and people will make bank, I say invest as you wish, if you can make cash on it go for it. Most companies have issues anymore its all a crap shoot. Good luck to all and dam if I do not want a dozen donuts now, cheers all."
2021-07-01 12:20:34,wallstreetbets,Soooo gay puts?
2021-07-01 12:32:36,wallstreetbets,OP just wants all that Kreme to himself. Besides if you don't have the risk tolerance to yolo your life savings on a failing donut shop maybe you don't belong on wsb.
2021-07-01 12:46:19,wallstreetbets,KK is very energy intensive for a retail store and the bottom line gets hit hard when utility prices spike. I remember this was the case about 12 years ago with the rolling blackouts on the west coast.
2021-07-01 12:47:34,wallstreetbets,Market can be autistic longer than you can remain solvent. This shit could üöÄ for couple quarters or years before it's DD fundamentals actually catch up to it and tank the prices back down where it belongs. Either way I wouldn't touch the equities or bull/bear options with a 10 foot clown pole
2021-07-01 12:47:53,wallstreetbets,"No one is buying Krispy Kreme donuts, so why would anyone be buying Krispy Kreme stonk?

No buy."
2021-07-01 12:49:27,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt even like the doughnuts because you can taste the sugar granules. Poor blending. Any hole in the wall local shop makes better doughnuts.
2021-07-01 12:54:36,wallstreetbets,The best evaluation on it was that they would already have to be selling as much as Wendy's in order to make the numbers work.
2021-07-01 12:55:31,wallstreetbets,Where is it indicated to open?
2021-07-01 13:02:12,wallstreetbets,Puts on fucking donuts.

2021-07-01 13:56:25,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs all buy puts.
2021-07-01 13:57:07,wallstreetbets,Only positive is they own Insomnia Cookies but that won't make up for the anemic numbers.

I do believe it‚Äôll be a yuge gainer, in like 10+ years. I‚Äôll buy in when it drops under $100 in the next 1-4yrs, but I‚Äôm out until then. 

The MM is a safe bet, but their source of income is up for grabs given the Defi push. P2P could and likely will dominate."

2021-07-01 04:26:43,wallstreetbets,It isnt a IPO problem. This is a YOU problem. Try getting yourself a brain
2021-07-01 07:56:47,wallstreetbets,"Exactly this.

Krispy Kreme initially publicly listed on the NASDAQ on April 5th, 2000, as [NASDAQ:KREM](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/ipos/overview?dealId=70156-3103),

Then switched over to [NYSE:KKD](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/KKD) on May 17th, 2001^(edit: correction) , dropping by 80% in value through 2005,

Eventually being unprofitable and being purchased by the private **JAB Holding Company** in 2016.

I really like Krispy Kreme donuts, but this ""IPO"" has a relentless history of red flags.

I was interested in the public listing until I read through the records.

Like the OP pointed out. Krispy Kreme is a sunken ship. You're better off with a donut-induced heart attack than investing in NASDAQ:DNUT.

Does anybody know how they're allowed to list again on the NASDAQ?

Genuinely curious, because I thought listing twice was not allowed."
2021-07-01 10:13:40,wallstreetbets,"Yup. The initial crash in 2004 when their practices came to light was my first introduction to the stock market. Convinced my parents to let me use some of my allowance money to ""Buy part of every donut instead of just buying one donut"". Literally bought like a week before it all crashed and burned.

Needless to say, I ended up here on WSB like the dumbfuck I am."
2021-07-01 10:10:05,wallstreetbets,Sooo‚Ä¶ buy puts?

2021-07-01 00:49:26,wallstreetbets,Try fresh with no glaze
2021-07-01 05:29:35,wallstreetbets,"They have such a strange aftertaste, though. Very artificial tasting. And there are now 2 gourmet donut operations for every Krispy Kreme, offering much more elaborate, freshly made donuts for around the same price."
2021-07-01 09:58:12,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately their coffee just isn‚Äôt that good.  They already failed in the northeast once and now they‚Äôre talking about re-expanding.  They won‚Äôt make it here with bad coffee.  Look at DD.  Good coffee, awful donuts, highly successful in the northeast even with all the local donut shops around."
2021-07-01 10:24:23,wallstreetbets,No they're fucking not. Krispy Kreme is comparable to the trash they sell you at the gas station.  Your standards are too low.
2021-07-01 10:38:50,wallstreetbets,what about the flesh donuts?

2021-06-30 20:56:23,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôd think‚Ä¶
2021-06-30 22:24:04,wallstreetbets,"It's product is terrible and people are moving towards baker's that are starting to offer donuts again. 

In Providence RI Dunkin Donuts forced all the baker's to stop selling donuts. Now people are willing to pay $2 for a donut of better quality so a bunch of places sell donuts now. Kripsy Kreme is worse than Dunkin too."
2021-07-01 09:51:50,wallstreetbets,"In terms of macro trends people won't eat doughnuts as much as they used to, and there's risks of fat or sugar taxes.

In terms of the business, they can be outcompeted not too easily by any factory as having the onsite baking does cost quite a bit (as awesome as it is).

It's also mismanaged as shit which is the main issue."
2021-07-01 10:30:14,wallstreetbets,"There was a Krispy Kreme located on the main street running through the center of the university of Tennessee for exactly one year before going under, all pre-covid, these stores just massively overproduce every single day and people just don't want donuts that often. Local bakeries have it best because they sell out before lunchtime and they're done for the day, with all profit and no waste."
2021-07-01 18:28:42,wallstreetbets,"There's no margin in donuts, but especially the way they choose to do it. The margins are in coffee which they suck at. Also they have trained their customers to only come if the sign is on and every other time the donuts are not fresh. Their marketing gimmick basically played themselves.

At DD if you weren't near 50% beverage mix you weren't making shit."
2021-06-30 23:10:25,wallstreetbets,"Nah. Only in markets where there are no good donut shops, that is, where there are only Dunkin' Donuts. Krispy Kreme fails in the face of Tim Horton's."

2021-07-01 01:43:26,wallstreetbets,I concur. Plus they tell my wife she has nice legs so I'm kinda forced to buy donuts.
2021-07-01 01:33:22,wallstreetbets,Aye bro I live in this area it really does go nuts in Canada cause there‚Äôs literally only Tim Hortons And Krispy Kreme and probably some small donut shops but idk any so that‚Äôs the point literally especially when they do they buy 1 get one box offer or half off
2021-07-01 01:42:58,wallstreetbets,They could increase profit 30% if they just stopped fucking accepting CA$ and took US$ only. There's the problem.right there! close down all the Canadian shops for an instant 30% profit gain!
2021-07-01 00:07:33,wallstreetbets,I have such good memories of Krispy Kreme. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|yummy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|yummy)
2021-07-01 12:35:29,wallstreetbets,"We had one in Calgary here, but they packed up and left. I never actually got the chance to see it (didn't even know it existed here to be honest), but someone brought some into work on the last day they were open and they tasted pretty good! Better than the garbage Tim Hortons (RBI) puts out now - and that's a tragic story for another day."
2021-06-30 22:01:04,wallstreetbets,That and 400 donut shops in every city
2021-06-30 21:28:04,wallstreetbets,Definitely the strategy you should use. Like buying a car- it's all about the color.
2021-06-30 20:47:13,wallstreetbets,Buy the hole
2021-07-01 10:04:02,wallstreetbets,"Yep, there was a staffed stall in a mall near me that opened a few years ago. The place always had big queues when I went past, but it closed in late 2019. I have no idea how it's so mismanaged but it is."

2021-07-01 16:39:40,wallstreetbets,"If people do/ do not buy a stock based on one persons opinion on the internet then that is not good. So your logic is flawed in that way. If I prevented people from buying this awful company then I‚Äôm happy about that because it might be up today, but it won‚Äôt do well in the long term in my opinion. Sure, today was great so what? Short term the stock market is a voting machine, long term it‚Äôs a weighing machine."
2021-06-30 21:47:39,wallstreetbets,"Fair, 2018-2019 also was terrible"
2021-07-01 07:20:31,wallstreetbets,"Used to work for a franchise and oddly enough most of the business came in the afternoon and evening, it‚Äôs more of an after school/dinner treat for most regions.

2021-06-30 21:35:08,wallstreetbets,Same for Shake Shack.  The crowds last about two months.
2021-06-30 22:36:13,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs fair, I have found that small places that make speciality ones right when you walk in also taste great and it‚Äôs the small business support too which is kinda nice"

Even their most basic donut‚Äîthe fluffy, glazed torus‚Äîwas fucking delicious (Edit: They still are I guess. That‚Äôs good to hear!). In their prime it was better than Dunkins, better than Hurts, even better than old man Dicks place in a town in the middle of nowhere with a population of 1200 people. As a 90s kid I used to stare endlessly at the donut making machine/conveyor belt on display through the window at a Krispy Kreme whenever we‚Äôd take a weekend trip to the city. It sucks they‚Äôre on their way out. All they would need is a total replacement of higher ups with dedicated but insane people that possess a moral compass and a complete overhaul/reinvigoration of their marketing that dives head first into the ridiculousness of selling donuts.

Edit: I used past tense ‚Äúwas‚Äù because I haven‚Äôt been to one for a while. All the regional KK‚Äôs here have closed shop. The closest one is now 9 hours away :( Sorry for the confusion."

Still worth going to, but you have to stick to the staples:  The dolls, the cremes, and the fruits (tango, ape, etc.).  Oddly, the best doughnut I think they ever made hit their menu last year - a key lime deal that, had you told me had an 8-ball inside it, I would have believed you.  So, of course, they stopped making it after like 2 months."

2021-07-01 00:14:32,wallstreetbets,"the part of the formula that fails is people eating the garbage daily.  Dohnuts are a ""very barley sometimes food"" for anyone but the most obese of people.  There just isn't that much blue collar high calorie work as there used to be so anyone with a brain knows regular donuts going to make you unfuckable pretty quickly.  Simply put, the demand for a breakfast of that caloric density is straight gone.  It's a treat, so unless their business starts to look more like Fannie Mae Chocolate they're probably fucked"

2021-07-01 16:33:00,wallstreetbets,it's all about the texture when they are warm. and they are the best thing to eat if you are sick since they taste the same in both directions.
2021-07-01 10:36:07,wallstreetbets,"Thank you.

I only take the kids there once or twice a year for a treat but honestly they like to look at the donuts coming off the factory line more than eating them."
2021-07-01 09:50:45,wallstreetbets,"They have these new donuts, that are the regular glazed ones, except they‚Äôre filled. It‚Äôs fucking delicious."
2021-07-01 10:02:09,wallstreetbets,I personally always thought they were garbage. Way too overly sweet. They are like the pop music of donuts.
2021-07-01 11:24:43,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been there twice in like 5 years and both times they didn‚Äôt give me hot fresh donuts regardless of their hot sign.  My krispy is dead to me.  Sucks.
2021-07-01 10:48:44,wallstreetbets,"They built one in the same parking lot of a local donut shop here a few years back. I tried them, not nearly as good as I remember. The local shop is awesome though, and they have a David and Goliath poster in their window now."
2021-07-01 13:34:30,wallstreetbets,Their fresh donuts are good but if it's not right off the conveyor belt they lose a lot of what makes them quality. They almost look plastic after sitting out for a bit
2021-07-01 15:20:46,wallstreetbets,"The Donuts are amazing, their management is incompetent though. A decade ago they opened a huge store in my town in a great  high traffic location but couldn't sell enough donuts and coffee there and so it closed about a year later. If they had tried a smaller outlet like other successful donut shops in the area or at least local bakeries that supplied various grocery stores and gas stations their valuation would be much higher."
2021-07-01 15:30:43,wallstreetbets,Their donuts have always sucked. They taste like chemicals.

2021-07-01 09:49:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, if you pay for your own MBA, you don't need it. The reason it's a highly paid degree is because people who have already proven their ability and already have high paying jobs are paid to get it by their employer. If you don't know what to do after school, join the Peace Corps or something. Just do something valuable with the time, so your resume says, ""Worked with dumb kids"" or ""Made soup in Guatemala"" instead of ""So stupid I gave my university more money to be over qualified for jobs I can't get."""
2021-07-01 09:01:38,wallstreetbets,"> The worst is that some of these people expected to walk into a nice job because they got their MBA yet had little real life work experience.   

That's true of most masters degrees that aren't in STEM. Case in point, people with theater MFAs can waltz into staff jobs at large performing arts companies without any real world experience. It's great watching union crews take them down a few pegs"
2021-07-01 08:35:00,wallstreetbets,I second this. I only went for my mba after having 5 years experience in my field. After TA from the job its nearly free.
2021-07-01 11:24:50,wallstreetbets,"Some companies will even ‚Äústrongly encourage‚Äù you to get an MBA even if you think it‚Äôs a waste of time. At the time, I thought I was being clever and said I‚Äôd only do it if they‚Äôd pay. Sadly, they agreed."
2021-07-01 12:54:47,wallstreetbets,"Bc that's just Fun but with a little d instead.

Lots of people thinking the housing boom may have ended, but isn't crashing. Just volume decreasing. So, this past year should have been the best in UWMC history AND likely the foreseeable future. It was always going to top out some point soon.

The way I play this stock is hold for divi, sell covered calls on my holdings. Easy money printing as it usually fluctuates between 7 and 10. I love it. If you are looking to buy, I'd suggest holding out til sub 8 to pick some up, or do some now, more later"

2021-07-01 18:54:02,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but for the most part they underprice pre-IPO shares (hence all the talk about IPO pop and fervour to get into stocks pre-IPO). Underpricing is less problematic due to the relative oligopoly the underwriters have (at least in the US markets) meaning that most firms wanting to go public will have to use them. (Plus, money left on the table is less problematic for firms because the IPO is only the first stage in a relationship with public investors). I mean, look at the prominent IPOs this year and last, most exploded at open.


Overpricing is a bigger issue because the distribution network can be more picky and expect to be able to capture that IPO pop. They can always go elsewhere and buy other securities, and have more power to negotiate lower prices on future IPOs because of that. That hurts the cut that underwriters get, etc, and so harms the bank more."

If he truly made $1,000,000 on AMD and is still riding the train, then that is a different thing. This says he just bought the shares within the week. It is part of a much much much larger account.

I mainly swing trade or hold shares of big cap blue chip American companies. Try to wait for a good 10% correction. You never think it will happen but trust me they always do. I will say if I was trying to build up a account from say 10-20k I would do options all over again. The easiest way to multiple small capital is with options you just have to eat a lot of stress.

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Should I sell or hold? Up 50% already on 2023 AMD LEAP calls 
2021-06-30 20:03:46,wallstreetbets,you have 2 years for a company that is only moving upwards to be at the price it already is. This is a no brainer hold
2021-06-30 20:23:54,wallstreetbets,Trim and run on house money. Always the move when you got enough to have fun with
2021-06-30 20:05:51,wallstreetbets,Merger is the big catalyst coming up. I‚Äôd hold till then on leaps.
2021-06-30 20:19:59,wallstreetbets,Sell half ride the rest
2021-06-30 20:18:37,wallstreetbets,"Why even buy leaps if you‚Äôll just end up leaving 18 months on the clock? Sell if you want to come back here in a year and make a post about ‚Äúshoulda coulda woulda made 100k more if i waited‚Äù. Really, you‚Äôre up 25%. Uncle Sam owns the other 25%."
2021-06-30 20:22:29,wallstreetbets,The merger doesn‚Äôt close until November so I think we‚Äôve got a good chance of shares going on sale again around earnings twice before November. But I‚Äôm not planning on selling because I don‚Äôt want to miss the rip to $120 and beyond
2021-06-30 20:52:29,wallstreetbets,"If in doubt Sell half of them, then no matter which way it goes you only feel half bad about it. 

They'll probably be worth good money in a year but they're worth good money now."
2021-06-30 20:06:14,wallstreetbets,"Please sell and *lock in* some profits.

Paper profits are not actual profits."
2021-06-30 20:07:13,wallstreetbets,Sell all but 1 and let that one ride. When did you purchase these?
2021-06-30 20:56:36,wallstreetbets,"Maybe sell a matching amount of LEAPS at a higher strike and turn this into a LEAPS credit spread?  That way you can hold onto your position, perhaps even leave room for additional upside, but get all or more of your original capital back to deploy into other assets."
2021-06-30 21:30:06,wallstreetbets,"If you got the balls hold. Take them to expiry. Amd might be 200/share. Pretty soon you might be in the clear of never seeing those contracts in the negative. 

Also you can sell a further out the money nearer dated calls or just a further otm same date call if you want to get some money out. Might be worth considering"
2021-06-30 20:25:03,wallstreetbets,If it‚Äôs good enough to screenshot then it‚Äôs good enough to take profits. Or seeing how this is WSB you can hold on to them until they expire worthless
2021-06-30 20:41:12,wallstreetbets,"I learned the hard way that JUST because it's a LEAP with years left on the option should NOT deter you from selling the option.

Also why I don't believe in LEAP options simply because every stock has their ""season"" before switching the overall direction."
2021-06-30 21:11:14,wallstreetbets,In the money Adam got you hooked on leaps I see
2021-07-01 03:15:09,wallstreetbets,My small penis says take some profits
2021-07-01 06:53:56,wallstreetbets,"Sell CCs against your leaps at a somewhat lofty strike price ( delta of .2 or less). If you're going to sell, might as well collect some extra premium to do it üëå"
2021-06-30 20:13:49,wallstreetbets,"If it were me I'd take profits. But if I weren't a tissue-handed bitch and I listened to my instinct, I would hold. Sure, these will probably be worth less at some point between now and when they are worth much more, but I expect they will be worth much more long before you need to start worrying at all about theta decay. My gut tells me AMD touches 100 before July earnings.

Of course this isn't financial advice, this text was generated by GPT-3."
2021-06-30 20:03:38,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm selling mine when it gets as closer to $100 as possible by the end of the week
2021-06-30 20:37:05,wallstreetbets,"Good enough to screenshot, good enough to sell.

Never fails."
2021-06-30 20:45:34,wallstreetbets,Sell. Buy WKHS!
2021-06-30 20:07:20,wallstreetbets,Always hold until you‚Äôre at a loss
2021-06-30 20:23:36,wallstreetbets,Those will be worth much more in a few weeks üëå it‚Äôs always nice to take profits but why would you do that right now? It‚Äôs been steady gaining. Just catch it on the way down if you feel like you should sell but I bet you‚Äôll see growth through the end of the week. Why sell for crumbs when you can have the whole damn pie?
2021-06-30 20:30:34,wallstreetbets,"Ide sell, but I‚Äôm a pussy profit taker"
2021-06-30 20:45:45,wallstreetbets,Sell half.
2021-06-30 20:54:08,wallstreetbets,You are in a great position. Hold and it will go up in the next 18 months. Sell half and roll the profits into a slightly higher strike.
2021-06-30 21:02:02,wallstreetbets,"In the wise words of the Steve Miller Band, ""Go on, take the money and run"""
2021-06-30 21:05:24,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm up 120% on 40 June 22 calls I bought earlier this month. I‚Äôm holding.
2021-06-30 21:06:32,wallstreetbets,"I had 4 x Jan 22 85c and I decided to take half off the table at 75% gain. I might buy when it dips, I might not, or I might buy something else‚Ä¶. To be determined. At least that‚Äôs what I did"
2021-06-30 21:11:44,wallstreetbets,"Let me get this right, you are asking whether you should hold or sell a measly 50% gain on leaps that you still have two years on?"
2021-06-30 21:32:22,wallstreetbets,Take your gains or the market will. Scale out or go all out. Buy back on the dip. There are 1000000000 ways to do it. However greed will leave you empty.
2021-06-30 21:41:05,wallstreetbets,I'd wait a full year on a 2 yr leap.
2021-06-30 21:41:34,wallstreetbets,take the profit and don't look back.
2021-06-30 21:43:02,wallstreetbets,Nice got 4 of those myself avg 16.40. This is an easy hold. Just wait till the Xilinx merger closes (it will).
2021-06-30 21:53:14,wallstreetbets,I would set a stop loss for an amount where you‚Äôd still be up like 30% then re enter if it keeps dipping. That way if it doesn‚Äôt dip u can keep running and if it does dip u still are up 30% and can re enter or do a different play
2021-06-30 21:56:15,wallstreetbets,Very hard decision. I would probably hold
2021-06-30 21:59:35,wallstreetbets,"My policy is to set a goal of the profit level you would be happy with and in general if it reaches that, press that button, unless of course it‚Äôs guaranteed to go even higher."
2021-06-30 22:02:08,wallstreetbets,Noice! You can probably sell 2 or 3 then let the rest ride out.
2021-06-30 22:04:49,wallstreetbets,Sell half. Let the others ride.  No skin in the game at that point
2021-06-30 22:17:46,wallstreetbets,I personally would hold. I'm up 109% and holding. Experts think it will move to $100+.
2021-06-30 22:26:16,wallstreetbets,Look at AMD's price over the last 5 years. Has holding been a bad idea yet?
2021-06-30 22:30:35,wallstreetbets,You have 2023 leaps. You most certainly should hold.
2021-06-30 22:35:19,wallstreetbets,Sell half for some hookers and a pile of blow. Keep the rest in the game in case you need bail and/or an attorney.
2021-06-30 22:35:19,wallstreetbets,Roll it into $SOFI while it‚Äôs still under $20
2021-06-30 22:44:19,wallstreetbets,Sell
2021-06-30 22:49:16,wallstreetbets,"If I‚Äôm holding my 28x July 16 calls that are green, you better hold those leaps or I‚Äôll hold them for you. 

We‚Äôre going to marz, you‚Äôre prolly going to Pluto or something like that with how much you could profit"
2021-06-30 22:52:28,wallstreetbets,"Hold man. Look at NVDA move over the last year for a reference. AMD is an amazing company that‚Äôs on pace to top Intel as the best chip makers in the business soon. Talk to people into building PCs and some will say they already have. You own leaps in a potential sector leading company, when the sector is arguably becoming one of the most important in the world as we‚Äôve seen the problem semiconductor shortages have caused. 

You have 8 golden tickets my man. I‚Äôd try to save up enough to actually exercise those contracts, that‚Äôs how bullish I would be on AMD."
2021-06-30 23:04:23,wallstreetbets,Sell portion to gain back your input capital. Hold the rest.
2021-06-30 23:07:01,wallstreetbets,"If you sell you‚Äôre a bitch, but you‚Äôd be smarter than 99% of the bitches in here"
2021-06-30 23:07:54,wallstreetbets,Hold!  I think we will see $110 in the next couple weeks.  That‚Äôs my target to sell
2021-06-30 23:13:59,wallstreetbets,Why not sell half of them?
2021-06-30 23:19:28,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll tell you the hardest lesson for me to learn was to let my winners run.  Good lord, dude.  1/20/23 expiration?  This company is doing everything right while their competition, intel, is doing everything wrong.  AMD will probably be $180 when this option expires, but yeah, lock in those gainz‚Ä¶"
2021-06-30 23:19:54,wallstreetbets,"AMD is going to $100 resistance before it pulls back, sell there."
2021-06-30 23:29:56,wallstreetbets,"Why not put in a stop limit a few percent below and have the best of both worlds.  If you get stopped out, so be it.  If it runs,  good for you and you can move your stop up if you want."
2021-06-30 23:38:32,wallstreetbets,50% brag. Yikes.
2021-06-30 23:38:34,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd hold but keep in mind it never hurts to cash out while ur ahead. Up to u tho my guy good luck

2021-07-01 00:52:18,wallstreetbets,No one here has given you good advice yet.  Sell weekly 20-30 delta calls against these leaps until you recoup your investment. Then enjoy a martini on a beach somewhere
2021-07-01 01:04:10,wallstreetbets,Hold for at least a year for long term cap gains
2021-07-01 01:14:03,wallstreetbets,"Sell weekly calls with a higher price strike. Every week, while you hold. Stock drops, you keep your premium. Stock rips, your leaps gain more than your weeklies. You make money either way."

2021-07-01 17:31:34,wallstreetbets,"With a name like ‚ÄúOptionsTrader‚Äù I would‚Äôve assumed you knew the answer to this question. Anyways, my option is that you obviously thought AMD had long term potential or you would‚Äôve had bought LEAPS. If you were looking for a 50% scalp, why buy the leaps? Idk, in my opinion, the deeper in the money you go, the better the leap becomes. Delta hits 1 and suddenly your moving dollar for dollar with the stock. I‚Äôd hold the Leap but that‚Äôs just me."
2021-07-01 15:12:47,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd probably book some profits, but I‚Äôm still long term bullish on AMD. Granted I think we see a short term correction in the next two weeks after going from 80 to 94 in something like 10 days."

2021-07-01 17:34:07,wallstreetbets,"Maybe with short term options but who buys a leap for a 50% scalp? Premium for leaps is so high‚Ä¶ idk man. Different strokes for different folks I guess. Also I‚Äôm not a fan of the whole ‚Äúselling my winners‚Äù thing. At least not with stock or leaps, short term options are obviously a different story‚Ä¶ IMO let your winners run."
2021-06-30 23:51:03,wallstreetbets,"If you are going to exercise them anyway, I‚Äôm just curious why wouldn‚Äôt you buy shares a bit cheaper than the strike? Before you bought the options, not sure if this is a dumb question lol"
2021-07-01 01:54:44,wallstreetbets,Why would you exercise... just gonna lose money that way.
2021-06-30 22:57:41,wallstreetbets,When is the merger going to set things off? I have 64 $110 calls for 7/23. It would be sweet if we got 1-3% daily gains until 7/16 then get a 15-30% rocket booster going into the next week.
2021-07-01 00:26:53,wallstreetbets,"because you're not ""wasting"" the theta on your options you're still selling them

thinking you have to hold long term options for a long term is a massive misconception. it's all about risk management and nothing else"
2021-06-30 20:27:23,wallstreetbets,This is the answer!  If you don‚Äôt have the hands to hold leaps for longer - then why bother?
2021-06-30 21:33:35,wallstreetbets,"Honest question, but why shouldn‚Äôt I buy leaps to sell quickly? If the trade doesent work out I can sit on them for a few month if need be with little loss to theta."
2021-07-01 08:23:11,wallstreetbets,You only get taxed on your profits
2021-07-01 11:01:11,wallstreetbets,Not everyone pays to Uncle Sam. ;)
2021-06-30 20:24:28,wallstreetbets,"It can just as easily go the other way and you'll ""shoulda woulda coulda"" sold. But I agree with leaps this far out, and a company this good, chances are these will see more green. 100k seems like a stretch with 8 contracts... I guess GME $85Cs expiring in 2023 at $150, so maybe?"
2021-07-01 06:50:21,wallstreetbets,Alternate strategy would be to sell another leap for the same expiry to collect the initial investment. This gives you bullish debit spread at $0.
2021-06-30 21:32:03,wallstreetbets,Oh look at mister I know what I‚Äôm doing over here.
2021-06-30 20:30:27,wallstreetbets,"Yup. It's just like in a casino: until you actually get up, waddle over to the cashier cage, and cash out your winnings, all you have is a bunch of pieces of plastic on the table. (Source: lived in Nevada for 10 years.)"
2021-06-30 21:40:31,wallstreetbets,"Well, it‚Äôs not the first one until you sell right?"
2021-07-01 02:31:09,wallstreetbets,"You would be right but like, there‚Äôs no way AMD will be worth less than ~$250 or $300 by that date."
2021-06-30 22:13:58,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck are you guys talking about? This isn‚Äôt one of these retarded meme stocks. This is fucking AMD, one of the best performing stocks and companies of the last decade plus. You bought LEAPs and are going to take short term gains because it just started to break out? Zoom out on that chart and tell me where sitting fucking tight has gone wrong."
2021-06-30 20:40:11,wallstreetbets,"If you want to derisk a little and lock in some gains then you could sell the August 20th 110 call against your leaps. If those expire worthless then you keep selling the next month expiration at whatever strike has a delta of .2 or so. By the time you get to mid-2022 you will likely have collected your entire (or close to it) purchase price in premiums from selling shorter dated calls against your leaps. Alternatively you could sell 2/3s of your position and the remaining 1/3 could go to $0 and you would still basically break even on the trade. Just a couple of ideas, but nice trade."
2021-06-30 23:01:49,wallstreetbets,Dude just sell one or two now so you‚Äôre taking pressure off it. You‚Äôre nervous or you wouldn‚Äôt be asking a buncha strangers. But don‚Äôt even think about selling more till you are up like 200% on the rest.
2021-06-30 20:25:43,wallstreetbets,"Stop loss on option play is asking to be cheated.  Especially on leap, the spread will be too big to trust.  They will steal your money!"
2021-06-30 20:33:25,wallstreetbets,"I think you mean over bought and it is not. Doesn‚Äôt really matter what the RSI is, but it currently around 77 on the daily chart. AMD is a leader in one of the most bullish sectors right now, a CEO who is getting hyped in the right circles and is not even at an ATH yet. The breakout is happening right now. Doesn‚Äôt mean there won‚Äôt be pullbacks along the way, but AMD will absolutely see triple digits this summer, probably in July, unless some unknown and unexpected news hits, which you can‚Äôt really plan for. This is a winning position, let it run."

2021-06-30 22:37:21,wallstreetbets,Smart man! I got close to $100k in SOFI already. Half in 2023 $50 LEAP calls and half in stock that I‚Äôm getting paid 50% interest to loan out to Fidelity.
2021-07-01 09:16:42,wallstreetbets,There are a lot of people in my life who already beat you to calling me that.
2021-07-01 15:23:03,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, either way AMD is gonna go UP"
2021-07-01 01:29:28,wallstreetbets,capitol costs are way cheaper to buy OTM leaps and you can do other things with that money in the mean time.
2021-07-01 13:08:08,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Always cheaper to sell the contract and buy the shares. Never makes sense to exercise.

I've been voted down heavily for saying this.

No idea why."
2021-07-01 02:52:40,wallstreetbets,Holy shit you're fucking stupid.
2021-06-30 23:19:08,wallstreetbets,Just a guess but I‚Äôd think around September for it to close.
2021-07-01 09:11:11,wallstreetbets,"Merger likely won't go through for a few months.

You are also missing earnings expected end of July with the 7/23 calls.

You could hold and sell and hope the stock runs up the week before earnings.

Or you can take your money and buy calls further out."
2021-07-01 09:08:53,wallstreetbets,"Yep.

If stock goes down, up, or runs sideways leaps  usually retain decent value.

While FDs can shit the bed by not mooning Tuesday morning."
2021-07-01 17:35:35,wallstreetbets,Theta doesn‚Äôt even really become a big concern until 45 days out or so
2021-07-01 10:04:25,wallstreetbets,A lot of people don't buy leaps to diamond hand gains. They buy leaps so they can hold through losses from not perfecting their timing and wait for it to go positive.
2021-06-30 22:08:09,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs actually a solid question. You have to ask yourself, why did you buy leaps to begin with? Is it a company that you believed would increase in value for another year? Was your strategy going into the trade, to make 50% and get out, regardless of time? At the end of the day, there really is no wrong time to take profits, but you‚Äôve already paid a massive premium for the extra time."
2021-07-01 13:07:29,wallstreetbets,Teach me thy ways
2021-06-30 20:35:01,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre not wrong, but like you said, these are leaps and AMD is a solid company + he has already paid the extra premium to have them that far out. I was exaggerating a bit on the 100k, but you get the gist."
2021-06-30 21:32:41,wallstreetbets,I don't know shit dawg
2021-07-01 17:38:43,wallstreetbets,Idk why people sell their winners on breakouts‚Ä¶ lol. Let it run. You think 50% is nice? Give it a year or two. Stock has been consolidating for a long time now and it‚Äôs finally breaking out‚Ä¶
2021-06-30 20:29:55,wallstreetbets,Sell half then?
2021-06-30 21:19:48,wallstreetbets,Relative Strength Index. Basically a momentum gauge. Over 70 indicates something is becoming overbought and under 30 indicates something is becoming oversold. By itself it is not a good indicator though because stuff can stuff above 70 and below 30 for a long time and there could be very good reasons for something being above or below those numbers.
2021-07-01 06:09:53,wallstreetbets,The only thing AMD does steadily is slap Intel. But I agree I don't see a large pullback as imminent.
2021-07-01 02:05:11,wallstreetbets,"I think amd has better outlook. But hold on, getting paid to loan stocks to fidelity? How does that work?"
2021-07-01 09:17:47,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs fine I just want to make sure you are aware. You‚Äôre ITM 18 months early. Why this is even a question? Clearly a try for a karma grab.

2021-07-01 01:02:38,wallstreetbets,The premium he paid for time is irrelevant because selling this early he gets it almost all back.

2021-06-30 20:41:04,wallstreetbets,"Sell a few of them if you want to secure some profit, but why are you buying 18 month LEAPS if you're going to sell them after the first month?  Average analyst projection for it now is around $107, highest is around $135, and it's got a big acquisition pending that should be finalized in the next few months.  

Do you think this is as high as it'll get for a while?  Do you expect it to go back down to $80 soon?  Are you factoring in the tax implications of selling then buying back on a dip?"
2021-06-30 20:15:54,wallstreetbets,"Buffet said ""When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever."" He didn't say any such thing when it comes to options :)"
2021-06-30 20:38:56,wallstreetbets,"For me personally, if I chose to buy a leap it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm committed - otherwise why not just buy a call?  Getting up 50% two years early complicates things, but good trading comes from formulating a trade (entry and exit) and then staying disciplined."
2021-06-30 20:32:16,wallstreetbets,Treasure island.

2021-06-30 20:48:23,wallstreetbets,"It's also usually pretty deep ITM when you purchase it.  You pay more up front for this but it minimizes extrinsic value and makes it much closer to holding 100 shares of the stock outright, but requires far less capital to do so (and, obviously, comes with more risk)."
2021-07-01 12:01:05,wallstreetbets,room temperature iq
2021-07-01 04:02:04,wallstreetbets,"I agree with this. I buy mostly longer term options so I can take advantage of the leverage, while not requiring a short term move in my favor. Would I be able to make more if I invested the same amount of money in shorter term calls? Sure. But the stock may remain undervalued until after those short term calls expire, in which case I would take a major loss. 

It's easy for everyone to say ""why buy leaps on AMD if you aren't going to hold long term?"" after it shoots up 20 points in a relatively short period, forgetting that it was flat for a good while before that."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"VIAC: God King DD for All My Coked Out Friends VIAC is a massive media company that is selling at a deep discount and is ready for a breakout. As many of you know due to some hedge fund tom foolery (thanks Bill Hwang) VIAC lost about half of its value. He went out in true WSB fashion, but thanks to him he have some WSB opportunities.

VIAC is an old media company that has lots of appealing properties, and now has recently announced they are focusing on streaming services. In their streaming service portfolio they have Paramount+, Pluto, and Showtime with Paramount+ being their new darling garnering lots of attention.

Now many have pointed out how VIAC has an extremely low P/E, great earnings reports, and more, but repeating that would be a waste of your time and mine. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3k1gk/god_tier_dd_viac/) post if you want to learn more.

Today I would like to point a few things out that many of us haven't noticed that are food for thought:

1.Paramount+ is doing better than many would have you believe.

https://preview.redd.it/rrfh4lw9ch871.png?width=1974&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe1effae0ad2e94b4fa92682586a6ae01074b692

Now Google Trends is no guarantee for sales, but it is a good indicator of interest. I have heard lots of slander on how Paramount+ has no good shows or how it can't compete with others in the field, but frankly I disagree. Their library is impressive if you dig into it and they are adding thousands of movies as we speak. On top of that, their ad campaigns seem like they are working and streaming has been gaining quarter over quarter for them on lesser streaming services they own like Pluto (seriously who uses Pluto). Paramount+ is gaining steam and that is going to show in the next earnings report.

2. Their Earnings Projections are underestimated

https://preview.redd.it/bl0d0nxuch871.png?width=1660&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b1b08b72987d60dd08a48a04230f24eb6a718b0

The current estimates have VIAC underperforming their last quarter. I believe there is no possible way this is the case. Their steaming revenues have vastly increased and the data coming in about their legacy cable networks indicates better than normal performance. For example, there have been reports that their ad cost per million views being higher than normal and that many of their flagship events have been going gangbusters (just see the BET awards ratings if you don't believe me). All signs are showing big revenue coming in that the analysts aren't factoring in, and I believe the earnings surprise is going to be bigger than last time.

3. The Acquisition Rumors

Out of all the major media companies that could be acquired, VIAC is the most likely to happen soon. There has been a frenzie to consolidate rights in media companies and VIAC is an obvious play for many media distributors. They are relatively cheap unlike other options like ROKU (which has been frequently talked about in acquisition rumors) and so it is very likely VIAC will be picked up in the next 6-12 months in the $70-100 dollar range.

Disclaimer: I have a position in this company. Here it is:

My concern is since they‚Äôre already a cable provider, and a large one at that, there‚Äôs antitrust issues depending on who is eyeing them up. I think if there was an acquisition it‚Äôd be for their production business and maybe their digital library rights. The latter is especially tricky because how do you even value a digital media catalog like this? It‚Äôs not the same as music. 

All in all, I‚Äôm in deep with VIAC LEAPs and agree it‚Äôs a gem."

2021-06-30 23:01:39,wallstreetbets,Holding my few hundred shares.  No options.  Don‚Äôt check the price.   Just get paid dividends and one day  I will wake up to see if back to 100 on an acquisition or something else.   That day maybe be two weeks from now or 2 years.   I can wait.   Ain‚Äôt doing nothin else anyway.  So yeah.
2021-07-01 06:00:44,wallstreetbets,"Great DD. I got in after Archegos shat the bed. More for the longer term.

Re the acquisition potential: Redstone family has the majority voting rights if I am not mistaken. It is pretty much up to them if VIAC is sold or not."

2021-07-01 01:00:24,wallstreetbets,2100 shares long and 75x $60 leaps. This is my biggest position by far and it's barely even getting started.

2021-06-30 20:18:33,wallstreetbets,"It takes a lot to move this stock and most of the big buys happened when it was dumped during the margin call.  I tried on this one and lost.  For me, its a no go, i wish you the best of luck, but i am out."
2021-07-01 01:28:17,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm in on this. My only worry is the resistance it‚Äôs facing around $45. I‚Äôm worried there are some other players holding more of Billy Hwang‚Äôs bags and dumping in that range. 

But I‚Äôm still in and hoping for a moonshot. 

Unless VIAC has a giant run up, acquisition is likely $55-$65 I think."

2021-06-30 20:50:36,wallstreetbets,"I saw a post about VIAC right after the price crashed in March, it's gone down \~$6 then back up \~$6 in the 3 months since then.

The idea back then was that it crashed due to the hedge fund sell liquidation with no change to the fundamentals and would go back up once everyone bought the cheap shares.

It's been 4 months since then and it's traded sideways at roughly the same price it was before the massive run up preceding the crash.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Unless WSB has enough money to force up it on sheer volume I don't see this happening. If it was going to run up why has it been going sideways for 4 full months?"
2021-07-01 11:42:21,wallstreetbets,Lmfao at all the bag holders. It will not hit $100 again any time soon bros.
2021-06-30 22:56:59,wallstreetbets,Uh lost half of it's value or got pumped by Archegos to unrealistic valuation?

2021-07-01 07:50:38,wallstreetbets,"I bought in around 40 and sold off bits at 41,42,43 and regretted it. Then someone herr pointed out we are going to 60 so I tripled down and bought at 46.5 again.

2021-06-30 22:05:37,wallstreetbets,"Your concerns are ones I have as well although I didn‚Äôt think it would fit my VIAC propaganda piece haha. I think even given what you‚Äôre saying be true VIAC is still undervalued (which given your leaps I assume you agree), but regulators seem to have been a little more friendly about acquisitions recently so we can cross our fingers? I think the Microsoft acquisition recently is a green light for some big acquisitions so we can only hope."

2021-06-30 22:18:18,wallstreetbets,Why does it take a lot
2021-07-01 13:12:26,wallstreetbets,They don‚Äôt need to beat those guys. The streaming arena is expanding in general so it just needs a share. VIAC market cap isn‚Äôt near those guys so the expansion doesn‚Äôt need to be on those level to see gains
2021-06-30 20:58:27,wallstreetbets,"To be fair it hasn‚Äôt gone sideways for months, it was at 38 when I bought in and is now bouncing between 45-47 which is a pretty good percentage difference. Plus, the aftershock of a dip like that often leaves a lasting effect"
2021-06-30 22:40:17,wallstreetbets,"It has been going sideways which is a good thing imo, considering it was nuclear waste 3 months ago. Fundamentals from Q1 were strong, and should be better in Q2 with reopening - streaming is hot, movies, and sports. I believe they report beginning of August. Also, in this case, sideways would be considered the accumulation phase. If you look the last few days it broke out of the 43.5 range that it was stuck in. It's in the process of retesting 43.5 and the 200sma. Got close today, but not yet. If it bounces strong off of that it could take out 50 quick. If not back in accumulation.

Another point, stocks have been going up without wsb for several hundred years. Often stocks like this one go up when people are bored and not looking. Something to consider is that steaming stocks have been trending up lately - ROKU, nflx, and dis along with viac is in the process. Maybe check out those stocks p/e ratios and compare."
2021-06-30 20:09:47,wallstreetbets,"I actually did look at that. You are right the majority isn‚Äôt in streaming, but the ad revenue which makes up the majority of their earnings usually slows down this quarter. After some research it seems many experts believe this is not the case and that the ad revenue is stronger than normal this quarter. Still, steaming is growing extremely fast and is where most of the EPS growth is coming from. It is the margin where eps is beating not the other areas."

2021-07-01 02:06:40,wallstreetbets,Something or somewhere in between.  VIAC is currently undervalued based on comps. And may have gotten a bit ahead of itself with Archefos.
2021-06-30 22:58:46,wallstreetbets,10 P/E is far below any media company in the market with any merit. Yes it was pumped but it is also undervalued in this market. Two things can be true at once
2021-07-01 00:27:42,wallstreetbets,"Dude, look at the earnings and lack of debt.  It‚Äôs undervalued and there are a shit-ton of shares.  It has taken a long time to consolidate after that massive sell off.  People saw the drop and were afraid to buy until the price stabilized.  It‚Äôs still over sold."
2021-07-01 01:26:11,wallstreetbets,"Archegos had little to do with the drop. On Thursday Bill Huang asked banks to hold selling off his holdings in hopes it would bounce back, then the next morning on Friday the banks went ahead with the liquidation, but by then the VIACOM stock had already dropped almost all the way to $49 a share and had hit bottom and it was already pretty much all over.

ARCHEGOS DID!!! NOT!!! COLLAPSE VIACOM STOCK, IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND, VIACOM ISSUING MORE STOCK IS WHAT COLLAPSED ARCHEGOS, VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY GETS THE STORY WRONG NOW DESPITE WATCHING IT HAPPEN.

""The management (VIACOM) decided to take advantage of the boom in the stock price by offering additional shares to raise close to $3 billion. This issue was priced at $85 per share, which was a 15% discount to where the stock had been trading on 22nd March ($100 per share). In addition to the fact that the new issue would dilute the existing shareholders‚Äô value, commentary from Wall Street research firms that the company‚Äôs management itself does not think that the recent rally of the stock to $100 is justified, led to a sharp reversal in fortune. This led to the stock declining ever since, and the drop over the last three months comes to about 48%.""[https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/06/09/where-is-viacomcbs-stock-headed-after-almost-50-value-erosion/?sh=352644a1eccd](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/06/09/where-is-viacomcbs-stock-headed-after-almost-50-value-erosion/?sh=352644a1eccd)"

2021-06-30 23:19:00,wallstreetbets,It's all about market cap. Shares outstanding
2021-06-30 22:46:08,wallstreetbets,Pretty large float
2021-06-30 22:19:34,wallstreetbets,"WSB retards expect everything to be a big green dildo all the time. Little do they realize a 10-15% gain in a few months is pretty fucking great especially if you are also exposing yourself to potential takeover bids. 

You buy VIAC at $45 and wait six months you will make at least 50% because it's almost guranteed to be bought out in the $70-100 range like you said. No way they sell for less than $70 given how recently the stock was pushing $100. Shareholders would riot. If 50-100% ROI is too poor for you, then buy some calls, IV is super low on this stock right now."
2021-07-01 05:26:15,wallstreetbets,"I was looking at the graph and assuming that the fall in to the sideways movement meant that it was overvalued and has now fallen back to it's fair value where it is staying.


That said I don't know shit about fuck when it comes to technical analysis, I'm basic my assumption on logic and since the market can be very irrational I may be completely wrong."
2021-06-30 20:16:47,wallstreetbets,"I do agree VIAC is very undervalued. I have a fair share price around $60, I‚Äôm just saying be careful how you phrase things. If you look at your wording it makes it sound like subscription is the only thing they have"
2021-06-30 22:23:43,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily, but possible. Take a look the chart, where do you think their bags sit? The banks sold off those shares in tranches.

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DIY Sentiment Investing - Beating SPY YTD and Sentiment ETFs since inception. Last week's numbers and positions: Hey guys! There‚Äôve been a lot of phenomenal sentiment trackers around WSB, and wanted to give a results-first take on that approach ‚Äî what I did was create one that focuses just one what people in this sub are saying. I‚Äôve created my own sentiment analyzer, and have been investing in it for more than a year now. If you want to take a crack at using it yourself, here‚Äôs the¬†[source code](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader).

NOTE: A popular sentiment investing ETF is a banned ticker, so I just called it Popular Sentiment Investing ETF

# The Important Stuff

Long story short for the week -- you'll $WISH you had $AMC in your portfolio last week, and...eh I got nothing. Anyways, when you compare this sentiment tracker to the benchmark social sentiment ETF, Popular Sentiment Investing ETF, this one wins hands down. **This algorithm has returned 55% since March 2 (when** Popular Sentiment Investing ETF **came out), compared to SPY's 10% and** Popular Sentiment Investing ETF's **7%.**

I rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below (equal-weighted), giving me a \*\*2.18% return week over week (net of any fees/slippage), compared to a 0.39% loss for SPY and 0.66% loss for my benchmark, the VanEck Popular Sentiment Investing ETF. **Important to note that not every week is a breakout win** (even if some member stocks in the ETF are), and not every week is a win at all. I've had some weeks where I've trailed both SPY and Popular Sentiment Investing ETF by a lot, but overall I'm beating SPY YTD and Popular Sentiment Investing ETF since its introduction.¬†

Your typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. In addition to scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I also logged the popularity of the comment (giving it something similar to an exponential weight -- the more upvotes, the higher on the comment chain and the more people usually see it) and/or post, and finally checked for the sentiment of each comment/self text post.

# How is sentiment calculated?

This uses VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‚Äòlove‚Äô, ‚Äòenjoy‚Äô, ‚Äòhappy‚Äô, ‚Äòlike‚Äô all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt really like‚Äù as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as ‚ÄúI LOVED‚Äù which is pretty cool. Phrases like ‚ÄúThe turkey was great, but I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the sides‚Äù have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There‚Äôs still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There‚Äôs a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don‚Äôt want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. \*\*Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like Popular Sentiment Investing ETF (on a risk-adjusted basis), sentiment analysis is by no means a ‚Äúlong term SPY-beating strategy.‚Äù\*\* I‚Äôm well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC (and more recently, WISH). These tickers do show up in Popular Sentiment Investing ETF, but after they do on Reddit and at a lower weighting.

So, the data from last week:

# WSB - Highest Sentiment Equities This Week (what‚Äôs in the portfolio)

Didi says it has the world‚Äôs largest network of electric vehicles on its platform: 1 million, including hybrids, as of the end of last year. Those EVs account for nearly 40% of the electric vehicle miles traveled in China, the company said, citing a study it commissioned. Didi has designed an EV itself, called the D1. It also says it has built China‚Äôs largest charging network, with more than 30% market share of total public charging volume in the first quarter of 2021.

Expect $DIDI to trade above $25 before end of this year.

2021-07-01 14:59:33,wallstreetbets,"I don't know shit about the company so I don't necessarily think they're crap, but if 50% of their float is short then there is a reason for that. Gamestop was 140% short because they were a failing company doomed to bankruptcy. People get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to research companies and if they deem them to be unprofitable and see a down trend in their future, then they short them. 

WSB is deluded into believing a high short interest is a positive and bullish sign for a company, but if you would use your brain for two seconds, you would realize that *maybe* there's a reason they're so heavily shorted."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Amazon posts for first time about RNG vehicles with CLNE About an hour ago, Andrew Littlefair sent a tweet reflecting on Amazons new post on their website about RNG being used on 2700 vehicles by end of 2021:

On the Amazon website it states:

We also launched compressed natural gas (CNG) tractors, which are fueled by renewable natural gas sourced from landfills and dairy farms. We plan to operate more than 2,700 of these tractors in North America, the UK, Germany, and France by the end of 2021. These initial investments allow us to test the performance of different sustainable technologies and determine which solutions could be most effectively scaled across our network.

https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/environment/sustainable-operations/transportation

Given that CLNE is in a joint venture with BP for future fueling stations in and around Amazon locations https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-bp-expand-renewable-natural-gas-supply-agreement-growing-number-fleets-asking-clean-fuel

We are looking at something with legs that will run soon.  Yes the price has dipped over the course of a month with a slow bleed but we may see a clearing just yet."
2021-06-30 22:12:36,wallstreetbets,"I work for amazon  and have people on my team who drive these tractors. They have purchased quite a few of them, but for now they are only being driven by their TOM (transportation operations management) associates. These were hostler drivers that amazon has paid to get their CDL so they can move their loads much cheaper than the 3rd party drivers do. While it's pretty amazing watching this plan unfold, and further planting the stake of their monopoly on everything, this is going to take some time. Right now TOM moves maybe 2% of amazon's volume with the rest being moved by 3rd parties. The game plan is obviously to eliminate any part of fulfilment that's not done by their own employees, from the Chinese factory to your doorstep. But this plan will take some time. I would say probably 3-5 years before a majority of their freight is moved by CNG. That being said, it will happen eventually. If CLNE is still a partner at that time, they will have either been bought by amazon or grown 100x over.

I agree that hydrogen will be a part of the long term solution. But currently the cost is too high. A company can convert their fleet to NG today. CLNE not only has Amazon but also Waste Management and the Port of LA as clients. This is not a winner take all solution. My opinion is that EV will dominate the personal vehicle market and that RNG/CNG and hydrogen will be the fuel of choice for fleet vehicles and long-haul trucks."
2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My Covid Stock Market Experience. Manic obsession with stocks helped me save 30 k. When the market crashed from covid I had 4 thousand dollars to my name. I became manic and fascinated with stocks. I learned how to read earnings reports, I learned how to evaluate a stock price using ratios etc. The stock market was like a completely different language and new world to me. I began pouring money into Facebook, visa, and Microsoft every week. I made great gains, at one point I was up 7 k. I‚Äôm a Canadian, all my stocks were in usd and the usd tanked as the covid recovery progressed. I started to panic as the losses in currency were more severe than my gains from the stocks. I started selling and buying randomly every day instead of just holding my stocks. This gambler mentality persisted for a year and somehow I only managed to end up losing 1k. Surprisingly, I was so addicted to stocks during this time that I saved every single penny I could to fuel my market addiction. 1.5 years later I ended up saving 29 k from my job. I would likely have blown this money on clothes or drinks or technology or something if I never got in the stock market.  I lost 1k from stocks directly, but I feel like I indirectly made 29k. As The Hulk would say, ‚ÄúI see this as an absolute win.‚Äù

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH Update 2 Hello guys, although we experienced some weak days in $WISH, setup is still bullish. (And I'm heavy long in this stock)

As I told you in last post about wish (""Wish Update"" and ""Wish Technical analysis"") we had a a big ressitance at 15, and two supports, EMA20 (1hr) and the uptrend line

See first on 10min chart:

https://preview.redd.it/l5h0sc3cng871.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3621c59d5b02a0adc34281b779e2c7c85fcc1d9

As you can see, WISH touched the uptrend line twice today, with a false breakdown nearly the close. 

So, we are still in the uptrend

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n9klhowbsg871.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=35065b3b47bc4110e66ae0a6d3f887621a383a57

About the 1hr chart and his EMA20, I presented as a good strategy for those who are day-traders use the EMA20 (1hr) as a buy or sell indicator (depends of we are above or below). And it worked well. 

I re-bought all my shares today early around 13.30/13.40 after wish touched the uptrend and rebound from there because I'm very confident about his future. All the facts we mentioned on ""$WISH Fundamentals"" and ""$WISH New Catalyst"" are still here. And the volume during this little downtrend is very low comparing with the last month.

We only traded today the 67% of the 30 Day Average Volume. Clearly this is not a panic scenario or something like that.

As I read from a guy on Twitter, dips are healthy, and it's true. Dips give the opportunity to other traders to jump in the stock, so, don't be scared when stocks goes down a few dollars.

I know that all of us were waiting for a big break on USD 15 resistance and we couldnt. Altough that, Setup is very bullish and I think this a good entry for those who were waiting an oppportunity.I hope a  very little weakness tomorrow at open, with a very bullish close. Market are experienced some volatility and that's the reason I dont see a extremely bullish flow at open. But once we touch the uptrend again, I think we will see it. 

12.50 is my stop loss, Large stop loss because I distrust of downtrends with low volume, usually are bear traps.

Know what you have guys, this is a very good stock IMHO.

2021-06-30 23:29:37,wallstreetbets,"Price in aftermarket is hardly an indication. For those that mentioned that the increase was priced in, it was normal for price to pull back right after earning unless it massively exceed expectations. However, if you read the report, Fcf would have been massive without the 8B in capex, but capex was good to increase their capacity that will be fully utilized for profit making due to shortage. Solid growth this year and is forecasting 25-35% growth. Even if it pulls backs it would be at max 5%.you can take a look at fedex right after the pull back its already coming back up"

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"100% of school buses could be electric within 15 years: Lion Electric VP 
Electric school buses may be the next wave of EVs to hit the commercial market, one executive within the industry says.
Patrick Gervais, Lion Electric (LEV) VP of marketing and communication, discussed the progress made with electric vehicles on a Yahoo Finance Live segment Tuesday afternoon.
‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a really good intention to electrify 100% of school buses within the next couple of years,‚Äù Gervais said. ‚ÄúWe could feel the hype all across the United States. I mean, we‚Äôve delivered buses in New York, in Minnesota, all across the country.‚Äù
The infrastructure bill, which is supported by President Biden, is expected to provide an additional $15 billion to electric vehicles infrastructure. Under the framework of the bill,  $7.5 billion is to be allocated to schools and public transit organizations to help convert to electric buses.
Gervais noted that a transition to electric school buses would have a plethora of benefits besides a reduction in carbon emissions. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no noise pollution, so it‚Äôs more quiet and the kids are more calm and more concentrated when they go to school,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese are the kids and the people of tomorrow [who] will drive electric cars in the future.‚Äù
Currently, less than 1% of school buses are electric. Over 400,000 school buses drive over 3.5 billion miles each year, according to a Bellwether Education Partners study. The transition to electric buses will take initiative, but with the right moves, Gervais said, the entirety of the US school bus fleet could be electrified in 10-15 years.
Abroad, electric vehicles have sparked the interest of consumers of late ‚Äî 11% of the 11.6 million new cars registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and Britain last year were either fully electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Meanwhile, EVs and plug-ins accounted for less than 3% of new car sales in the United States."

They also built a plant on Joliet, IL and have functional buses and semis.

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MU - earnings upcoming - my views [https://investors.micron.com/events-and-presentations](https://investors.micron.com/events-and-presentations)

in about 30 mins from now

I have a small long position in micron. 

May 25 - At JPMorgan Global Technology, Media, and Communications Conference, Micron announed it expects revenue for the quarter to be at or above the high end of the stated guidance range. This is SOP for Sanjay and nice to hear if you have been in Micron for a little while. 

June 1 - announced volume production of DRAM using Node 1Alpha. This is 14nm but using DUV instead of EUV so its cheaper to make. Samsung and SK Hynix are using EUV for 14nm, but havent seen head to head comparisons yet. 

Thesis - If this Node 1 alpha process is comparable to Samsung/SK Hynix 14nm stuff, it means higher margin for Micron. It means better guidance moving forward obviously as well. 

Samsung's former president is in jail which seems to be screwing their business up a bit. Has been steadily losing market share and margin to SK Hynix and Micron. 

(these are my opinions, no proof etc dont sue me)

""Semi conductors are cyclical"" - yeah but we are deep into tacit collusion now on pricing. We basically going to see ""short supply"" forever. The risk here is not in over supply but in an anti-trust/competition ruling. This is going to be incredibly difficult to find unless someone talks or leaves a smoking gun. These companies arent stupid. Its incredibly easy to enter into tacit collusion because its the reasonable and logical choice but its incredibly difficult to prove. Even if they do prove it, the disgorgement in profits still makes it +EV so it doesnt even matter that much. 

People are reading Microns reluctance to increase capex as an indication of no confidence in future demand. Thats not the way I see it. This is part of the tacit collusion. They basically get to tell their competitors ""hey, we are not increasing capex that much and you probably shouldnt either unless you wanna stop the gravy train"". 

Lets extract from their last Q2 report. "" CY-21 DRAM industry bit demand growth of approximately 20%, with DRAM industry supply to be below demand; DRAM market is currently facing a severe undersupply, causing DRAM prices to increase rapidly ... CY-21 NAND industry bit demand growth in the low-to-mid 30% range, with NAND industry supply exceeding demand; more CapEx cuts are needed to allow for healthy NAND industry profitability...Long-term DRAM industry bit demand growth CAGR of mid-to-high teens"" 

followed by

"" CY-21 DRAM & NAND Micron bit supply growth expected to be below industry demand growth...Long-term DRAM & NAND Micron bit supply growth CAGR in line with industry demand growth CAGR...Across DRAM & NAND we target long-term cost reductions in line with industry""

Make of that what you will. Sure seems like a convenient way to say lets all make money together. At the same time its entirely logical and explainable. 

&#x200B;

Things I want to find out in the call:

\- Is micron doing R&D into EUV for the next generation? Contracts lined up with ASML for EUV plant since ASML has a backlog? Might be super secret stuff but would be nice to know. 

\- guidance for next quarter and next financial year (obviously). I think this is going to be higher than expected due to the Node 1 alpha mass production assuming it is decent. 

\- Is Micron going to continue spending money on R&D and poaching talent? Seems to be working so far imo. 

&#x200B;

My thoughts on price - we see a little pop because the high end of guidance is already priced in despite Sanjay always blowing earnings beyond his pre-announcements. Because thats priced in as well. However Micron sometimes sells off post earnings which is incredibly annoying so I dont think weeklies etc are good. Just buy the stock and hold it. 

Historic PE rations etc are all crap here. We are in a new business model. Its not cyclical anymore."

2021-06-30 20:25:48,wallstreetbets,"Technicals still look good IMO. It is above the 5, 10, and 20 EMAs and if Monday‚Äôs low continues to hold up it will have made a higher low. Needs to break and hold $15 to create a higher high though so it could break down. The most bullish factor for CLOV in the short-term though is the extremely high borrow fee to short it. That makes shorts sitting ducks for any whales who want to force them to cover by buying a bunch of calls expiring within the next couple of weeks. I have yet to see a squeeze, including GME and AMC, where there wasn‚Äôt massive call buying immediately prior to the rapid move. That‚Äôs the playbook and I think it is going to happen again with CLOV. I have 7/16 $15 calls though so I am biased."
2021-06-30 21:59:28,wallstreetbets,"Though I'm in CLOV, I have been leaning towards your take on things. The uncertainty makes me feel as if I'm hyping myself with ""thoughts and prayers"" instead of doing something to improve my trading. Either way, I like to read different perspectives because it paints a better picture psychologically, instead of being completely delusional. All the ""to the moon"" comments wears me down more than it lifts me up, pun intended."
2021-06-30 22:57:33,wallstreetbets,"outlier on price movement

many will draw trend lines from tip top on some outrageous, but using the secondary next high has more relation over future movement"
2021-07-01 01:29:23,wallstreetbets,LOL. thanks for adding to conversation
2021-07-01 03:56:15,wallstreetbets,How much did you lose and what was your cost basis?
2021-07-01 07:42:37,wallstreetbets,GME and AMC have not squeezed yet

2021-06-30 20:17:41,wallstreetbets,"Yesterday, they shitted on me calling me names for talking about $CLOV. 
I thought we're all apes for the same reason. I supported AMC and GME as well in the past."
2021-06-30 21:33:29,wallstreetbets,"Idk ytd the removed completely legit post in my opinion, they removed SEC filings analysis before that, with thier own interpretation of what was there. It‚Äôs been interesting journey for CLOV"
2021-07-01 01:43:36,wallstreetbets,"Trying to keep short dated calls to reduce costs since the DD is basically ""will moon soon"".  Figured i would throw a grand at it."
2021-06-30 21:59:43,wallstreetbets,"Well ok. But it's coming off a pump so the only way is down and this idea that shorts have to cover and it will create a short squeeze is just the popular thing on social media because they can just FTD, and then, they can kick the can down the road by buying puts way out of the money, and keep rolling those over. They don't have to do that forever, just longer than most investors are willing to hold, which is not as long as you would like to think."
2021-06-30 22:07:22,wallstreetbets,Exactly. I've grown jaded much too fast and don't listen to the hype as much anymore. I'm pretty cynical now but I think that's a good thing.
2021-07-01 08:36:01,wallstreetbets,"They both have, guess you could give the argument that they both haven‚Äôt fully squeezed yet, but they‚Äôve certainly squeezed"
2021-07-01 08:01:34,wallstreetbets,I'll never learn.
2021-06-30 22:23:57,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs part of my WSB Retarded Ape index fund, but I‚Äôm only holding 1 share. Don‚Äôt have cash on hand to yolo"
2021-06-30 23:05:34,wallstreetbets,"They pop up I read them, there is never any information about the company, only talk of a short squeeze"
2021-07-01 08:38:37,wallstreetbets,"A few weeks ago your comment would‚Äôve been downvoted into oblivion, glad to see people are finally starting to realize CLOV is a better play than both GME and AMC right now."
2021-06-30 21:45:17,wallstreetbets,"Yea I mean Idk for sure all that was removed. My advice to everyone would be the same. Make sure what you have to say is productive and worthwhile and don‚Äôt just pump a ticker for spamming and squeezing I guess. I don‚Äôt feel the need to spam tickers I‚Äôm in, I really just prefer shitposting with others."
2021-07-01 01:54:11,wallstreetbets,"right on. ive been going with longer dated, higher delta closer to ITM

8/20 12.50C with a delta of .64

i have some 16c 7/16 as well tho"
2021-07-01 00:07:20,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think it is a matter of them not delivering shares as much as it is the fee they are having to pay to hold the positions open. They need the stock price to go down 5-10% per month just to not lose money on the trade because of the fees. The risk versus reward on that trade doesn‚Äôt make any sense to hold for longer than the very short term so either they will move on to a different short or something will have to happen to cause the fee to go down. It‚Äôs a game of chicken right now so we will see what happens.
2021-06-30 22:20:33,wallstreetbets,"I thought it was just me. Been coming up with all these conspiracy theories, basically summed up by, ""the market knows who you are!"" Haha. Must be partly due to my insanity. Keeps me us grounded,I suppose."
2021-07-01 02:13:31,wallstreetbets,"I hear ya on the MAJORITY of clov posts, but if you don‚Äôt think CLOV is a decent company with decent fundamental prospects, then you need to read up on companies outside of Reddit. Try crunchbase, wsj, TechCrunch.

Not 100% sure about S&P because it's acting weird.

The 2% that I'm wrong is if S&P moons so hard it drags NASDAQ up, due to the overlap. It's possible, given the wonky nature of SPY rn. But it's within my risk tolerance.

Based on the price action today (endless high volume sells and low volume pumps, as big money fucks with the bid/ask spread) and the ""rotation"" out of tech (which I think is fake but whateva), I am like 98% sure NASDAQ is gonna take a shit tomorrow. The stars have aligned for a red day, and I went all-in on QQQ puts.

Not 100% sure about S&P because it's acting weird.

The 2% that I'm wrong is if S&P moons so hard it drags NASDAQ up, due to the overlap. It's possible, given the wonky nature of SPY rn. But it's within my risk tolerance.

I got my position finally fully built out yesterday. If there‚Äôs a dip of any significance below current levels I will buy more, but I‚Äôm happy w the % of my portfolio I have dedicated to CRSR. I‚Äôm sitting in front of my Corsair-heavy custom PC I built at the beginning of 2020. It‚Äôs a beeast, And my RGB is pretty beautiful and elaborate NGL (shush RGB haters, let me live my life it‚Äôs my first RGB PC)

Also, bonus point for anyone who didn‚Äôt know this, the Corsair software is the only reason I‚Äôm able to completely customize every little detail about how my RGB rotates, shifts, changes color based on what App Im using, and a million other settings. And key point: *this Corsair RGB software that lets you coordinate all of the components‚Äô RGB so you can control it all from one application (called iCue software) is the best and basically only software that allows you to control components of any brand from 1 app INCLUDING COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT CORSAIR*. I also noticed the longer I have had this software, the more non-Corsair components have become compatible with iCue. For example my motherboard didn‚Äôt used to be in iCue but now it is supported, and it‚Äôs not Corsair. 

If anyone knows of any other software that can compare on these points, let me know. Maybe I just don‚Äôt know it yet. But I‚Äôve also used RGBfusion from GIGABYTE, and aura from Asus. They‚Äôre still installed on my PC, but I don‚Äôt need to use them anymore since their components have become compatible with Corsair‚Äôs iCue in the past year and a half."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Seems kind of fool proof only playing this with 20% of portfolio. can anyone provide a reason why this wouldn't be a good idea? In my personal experience whenever a strategy seems fool proof you're missing something very key.

My strategy is to buy 70 delta leaps on growth indexes such as $SCHG, $VUG, $SPYG indexes, now I understand the fed raising interest rates could be very damaging to this strategy and I'm willing to accept that risk; the current plan for me is to buy these 70 delta calls and selling 30 delta short term weeklies against my call contract creating a diagonal spread whenever I see turmoil in the markets to lower my cost basis. To me this seems much more cost efficient than buying the shares and selling covered calls against it. \\

Just looking for any insight, thanks."

2021-07-01 04:47:49,wallstreetbets,"I was gonna discredit this post because the DD is wtf‚Ä¶.but on paper, this is a pretty decent company‚Ä¶albeit, low market cap. 

- no debt?!
- profitable with decent FCF of 30mil for a small cap company
- growth slumped QoQ in 2020 but was still overall growing YoY. Q1-21 saw earnings and revenue grow. 
- P/E of 20 is quite high though

It‚Äôs currently lower than its 50 day and 200d average and it could be a good time to enter. I might get in this stock when it goes down to ~$30."

They are genuinely impacting some companies,  like AMC for example. But for the most part, I see WSB and memes like civil war soldiers attacking the big money. Wave after wave of soldier runs to the front, buys as much as they can, bidding up the price so the big boys can dump their shares to the masses. Half of the soldiers get stuck holding the bag as momentum evaporates when the euphoria fades.

This forum did shakeup the Street and not just hedge-funds, it shook up the entire way things have been done for over a century. Rocks have been overturned and surprised many at what crawled out. Robinhood, the one time darling of the apes to fight the man got caught being the man. Money ""advisers"" hate WSB, they can't figure it out and their clients are asking why they are not smarter than apes.

High price ""advisers"" are now hieing bots to monitor WSB and record what stoks are mentioned and how many times. NEGG, NEGG, Newegg. They are also screaming for the SEC and congress to investigate the apes. I thought congress did and all they found out was apes are not a cat.

I am a Boomer with 98% of my investable wealth in low cost Vanguard ETFs. My son got me to come here back in January when the meme stoks first started generating excitement. I got caught up in it a little too. I'm glad I did it was well worth the price of admissions, especially now that NEGG Newegg took me to the moon; I'm finally showing a slight positive return for this trip down the rabbit hole.

2021-07-01 00:24:11,wallstreetbets,"Well put! While I'm still a millennial,  I've been trading since the '08 crash so I've seen enough market shenanigans to resist the urge to yolo meme stocks and short or fade the rallies. 

Look at a weekly and daily chart.  Negg has had some wild moves which the market rejected each time, so I think this ones a dud. I was going to buy puts but they are expensive and I'm fully allocated elsewhere.

Having said that, I do have a negative bias towards the company ever since they got bought up by China and expanded away from their core business, electronics and computer hardware."

There is a vacuum between Teladoc's valuation and Well's valuation. Nature hates a vacuum. If able to get listed, I feel should get more visibility for the stock, for further expansion powered by share issuance. I find that their acquisitions are cash-flow positive, not really dilutive--and each acquisition has  cost containment through economy of scale. 

There was a good line I came across that software is eating the world but chokes on healthcare, but Well seems to be able to navigate it successfully so far.

I give it even odds of Well being acquired sometime over its lifetime, leading candidate Telus. Telus alas isn't able to innovate much as a large company, but has capital to buy companies who do. Unless there is a tech crash, Telus or others will be coughing up quite a premium to buy Well."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A personal way of doing DD on WISH. Background:

The first time when I saw WISH populated here, I decided to do some DD. Many people here have done good job on DD by analyzing WISH‚Äôs financial statement or technical charts. They are very helpful but can‚Äôt answer my key suspicion as whether WISH can deliver goods on time(aka within the acceptable time frame that I am willing to take given the huge discount on the goods) 

Methodology:

So I decided to use WISH to buy something for the first time( I didn‚Äôt know WISH at all until retards here talking about it‚Äôs price jump three weeks ago.) To me, it is no brainer that people expect relatively lower quality and longer delivery time with huge discount on products from WISH. I just want to to make sure the quality and time frame is acceptable. My assumption is that WISH will have a good future if the product quality is acceptable and product can be delivered within the date frame WISH committed when I made the purchase.  So I bought the first item as showing in the attached pictures. 

Results:

I bought this item on June 9th and it was said to be delivered by July 3rd. I am in Canada by the way. I picked up this item is Free on WISH. I only paid shipping $1.21.

On June 30th, I received the item as showing in the attached picture.  The quality is good.  But to me the most important thing is it was delivered to my mail box three days before the deadline. So it make me very comfortable to buy WISH stock as well as their goods.I think WISH has overcome its current greatest hurdle of not being able todeliver items on time due to the transportation issue caused by COVID. 

Full disclosure: 

Since June 8th, I have been buying and selling WISH a few times to play along with the volatility. I am always leaning towards to long side. Now I am holding 5000+ of WISH stocks.  My current plan is holding it until $16ish (don‚Äôt ask me why $16. It is just a number looks right) and then play with the volatility again. And always, I will lean to long side while playing with volatility.

Edit 1: Hi, can someone help me on how to post pictures along with my text here?

Edit 2: finally I figured it out. Here is the link to see pictures and screenshots

Imagine this. The company has debt at 4.5% and pays a 2% dividend. How smart do you think that is?"
2021-06-30 23:01:11,wallstreetbets,"That's pretty dumb, lol. I suppose I could see the argument (and bear in mind I know nothing about this company) that if they had a consistent dividend before then suspending the dividend to service the debt would piss off investors. 

Companies value debt differently than individuals. They do weird stuff like carry balances forever... they'll take out a balloon loan (where you only pay interest and then pay back all the principle at the end) then roll it into *another* balloon once the time is up. I'm sure it makes sense to do, but IDK the reason."

2021-07-01 00:24:31,wallstreetbets,"Which is exactly why you should ever have a consistent dividend. It‚Äôs just a shitty thing to do. 


If you have too much money then pay down debt. If you don‚Äôt have debt then invest it internally if you might need it. Literally invest it in bonds or something. 


If you really need to distribute it because you just have so much, Do buybacks. More efficient. If your stock is too high then do a special dividend. 


That way nobody is counting on the dividend. 


I once was invested heavily in an oil and gas company. A small one. It was paying a huge dividend despite saying it‚Äôs shares were super low. They should have cut the dividend. Stock falls even more? Fucking great. Buyback even more shares.

Cant believe I have to explain this on WSB, but the energy market prices fluctuates, so utility batteries are basically robinhood accounts that allow them to buy low (night) and sell high (day), sometimes even cashing out at the moon (selling during a power crash).

By providing power in this manner they smooth out the peaks and troughs in the grid and reduce the need for more generation."

2021-07-01 02:35:54,wallstreetbets,"You're giving a great explanation of a superior vs inferior implementation. Before the mask people already had issues with Face ID when wearing things that cover the eyes like glasses. Also, it's less secure than Touch ID since it can be fooled more easily. At least, that is what the reports are showing. We did not have all these issues with Touch ID. 

Then why did they drop it? Simple, to make more room in the PCB. Dropping the home button (and headphone jack) made the phone slimmer and shorter. 

Vision will be the same. It has problems with snow and rain already. I don't see it improving any time soon, since rain and snow will always block the sensor from time to time. With radar we did not have this problem at all. To support all edge cases both sensors are needed."
2021-06-30 20:04:17,wallstreetbets,"My understanding is they tested the vision only implementation before making this decision. The changes to accomplish this are fundamental to how the system works.

Galileo gives SOFI a moat that would be difficult to replicate for a legacy bank with their large scale rigid technological and physical infrastructure and that make them less and less competitive as the adoption of digital banking continues to accelerate. Their strategy is a combination of product differentiation and cost leadership. For example, they were the first with fractional shares as well as the first to offer a comprehensive suite of financial products from a single app. They are also the first fintech offering users access to IPO investing. Cross selling across the suite of products lowers their customer acquisition costs - saving that can then be passed down to the customer. The bank charter will increase their lending margins and they plan to offer a highly competitive APY on the SOFI Money accounts with the cost savings. Their competitive advantage will be their ability to continue innovating on the consumer product and enterprise sides of the business. They have a strong management team that I trust will be able to execute the strategy and continue to grow the business into an industry leader along side Square and PayPal."

[Family Vs Thanos](https://preview.redd.it/op7pfr5kpf871.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9f415ff14cf8a7f2d9101b0f0a019c852ef2ab7)

Good afternoon fellow degenerates, as I sat in the movie theatre last Sunday watching cars in space in F9 I couldn't help but notice the sheer amount of times Dom and the other characters constantly go on about ""Family"" as they always tend to do at least in the past few movies. Once I got home I realized there absolutely had to be a correlation between how many times family was mentioned in the films and the S&P 500 performance. So naturally I did some research on the S&P 500 return 3 months after each movie was released. The results are below:

&#x200B;

**The Fast and Furious (2001)** 

* 2 Family Mentions
* S&P 500 3 month return -260 points

**2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)**

* 0 Family Mentions
* S&P 500 3 month return +34 points

**The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift (2006)**

* 1 family mention
* S&P 500 3 month return +68 points 

**Fast Furious (2009)**

* 1 family mention
* S&P 500 3 month return +194 points

**Fast Five (2011)**

* 5 family mentions
* S&P 500 3 month return -11 points

**Fast and Furious Six (2013)**

* 10 family mentions
* S&P 500 3 month return +13 points

**Fast & Furious 7 (2015)**

* 7 family mentions
* S&P 500 3 month return -4 points

**Fast and Furious 8 (2017)**

* 14 mentions
* S&P 500 3 month return +98 points

**Fast and Furious 9 (2021)**

* 5+ family mentions
* S&P 500 3 month return ?????

Looking at these results we can see that the movies that had 1 or less family mentions the S&P vastly outperformed movies who had multiple mentions following 3 months after release. I was actually shocked to see how much better the 1 or less family mentioned movies performed. Looking back at how I presented the information it would have been better to show percent change instead of point change but I'm feeling lazy right now just now the percent change is a lot larger in the pre 2010 years.

**Moving Forward:** As I was in the movies this weekend researching F9 I counted easily 5 family mentions perhaps a lot more I lost count. Their is no official count out yet but it is definitively bigger then 5. With this information in mind the next 3 months of the S&P will historically be very negative.

This is not financial advice."

The successful cooperation has been in place since 2020 and the significant growth of eCommerce and demand for freight capacity in the last year have led the parties to deepen their collaboration.¬†¬†¬†¬†

**Eli Glickman, ZIM President & CEO** noted: ""Since we launched the initial agreement with Alibaba.com, it has proven to be a highly successful and mutually beneficial partnership. We continue to position ZIM as a leading eCommerce service provider, while creating significant advantages for customers. It is part of our innovative strategic vision, and we are very proud to extend and expand this partnership with Alibaba.com to enhance the customer experience and further capitalize on growing eCommerce trends.""

**Kuo Zhang** **,** ¬†**General Manager of** ¬†**Alibaba.com**¬†added: ""We are happy to continue our collaboration with ZIM to enhance our ecosystem designed to bring the best services to global customers quickly.

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TSLA: The Bearish Case So, the Chinese state media has been shit talking Tesla for weeks, and their sales are plummeting in China as a result. 

After a woman protested Tesla at the Shanghai Auto Show in April, state media organs compared their cars to the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. 

Yes, really. 

Both in terms of production and sales, Tesla needs China. 

But does China need Tesla? With three viable EV startups on the market, the answer is no. 

First off, it is no coincidence that XPeng, Li Auto, and Nio all opened around 2015, when Tesla first started to become profitable. DiDi drove out Uber, Baidu drove out Google, and these EV startups will drive Tesla out of the biggest EV market in the world, because the Chinese government has a history of economic protectionism. They subsidize the fuck out of the industries they want developed, then force out Western companies by any means necessary. 

Look, I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt invest in Tesla.‚Äù I‚Äôm saying consider the three EV startups in China, and watch that market very, very fucking closely.

The SEC won't protect you (not like they ever do, tbh) and the Chinese will laugh and laugh and laugh as they end up with your cash and yet another story of tricking a dumbass westerner out of all his money. :)

I get that electric cars are sexy, and that you want to get in early on the next Tesla (that's called FOMO), and that having over a billion potential customers is cool as hell - but dude, that's not worth it. That's just like finding a cheap deal on a vacation in North Korea: sure, it might work out, maybe, but if it doesn't, you'll be soooo fucked LOL

Don't go chasing Chinese waterfalls, better stick to meme-stonks and DDs that you're used to. :)"

2021-07-01 01:17:32,wallstreetbets,"I agree that these Chinese EVs are great buys. 

Just don‚Äôt underestimate the number of Chinese that will buy Tesla in silent protest as a result of this media campaign. 

China also did this with Apple and Huawei among other players launched fierce competition. Apple still crushes in China."

- Chinese media is not talking shit for weeks.
- Woman was a freak, this got debunked multiple times.
- sales are fantastic. It will be proven tomorrow again
- soft recall OTA, which is super easy to do and is totally normal. My iPhone got ‚Äûrecalled‚Äú multiple times this year alone.

You are way too much believing what the US media wants to tell you and frame tesla. Start to read more content, and you will see that many of these news are just a clickbait narrative (which you fell for).

2021-06-30 20:19:17,wallstreetbets,"Why is this a big problem? When their customer satisfaction (based on the question would you buy the car again, by consumer reports) is far higher than anyone else, one would think that just maybe the vast majority of people paying for FSD are well aware that it might be a few years still. If you are not smart enough to understand that the vaunted self-driving ability might take a few years to be accomplished, you are probably not smart enough to drive a car. Definitely not smart enough to afford the subscription to FSD."

My dollar votes are not based on surveys, what is heard from someone else, or internet postings... my dollar votes are 100% based on my PERSONAL experience with Tesla's service centers since I took delivery of my car till now.

I truly do NOT wish my experience on ANYONE on the planet. I do hope everyone who owns a Tesla gets Exceptional Service, however, I seem to be highly targeted at ALL Tesla Service Centers with consistently BAD Service for almost 3 years now (More extreme examples at the Seaside, CA Tesla Service Center by Mr. Ken Sickler). ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è It would be something horrible if * I * some how am singled out to be black balled by Tesla Service Centers for some unknown reason and for items that are clearly with in my rights as a new car owner covered by the Original Factory Bumper to Bumper warranty."
2021-06-30 21:01:48,wallstreetbets,"Problem for investors, some chunk of that $679 share price is FSD being priced in. What happens when people realize Tesla can't deliver on the promise and they stop giving the stock credit for something that's not happening."
2021-06-30 22:26:54,wallstreetbets,"Overvalued is a subjective term but P/E isn't. 

Last time I checked compared to say Ford Tesla had a 10x higher profit to earnings ratio.  During 2020 Ford sold around 4.3m vehicles compared to Tesla 0.5m. Tesla has good growth on it's side and I might even argue they are worth more than Ford but not 10x as much as Ford."
2021-06-30 22:14:04,wallstreetbets,"There are always people that just have bad experiences every time. Every company has this. That is why your personal experience has to be looked at in terms of everyone else. I know people who own Teslas and they just love them and would not get anything else and tell others they should get them. That is my experience and it is reflected by what the polls show, namely that yes, the vast majority would if making the decision again would buy Tesla at a far higher rate than any other car brand.

I am not questioning your bad experience and how that makes you feel, just pointing out that the vast majority feels otherwise. This is not me, but consumer reports in their own poll concluding this."
2021-06-30 22:08:42,wallstreetbets,"They won't allow a mobile tech to come out to fix anything on my driveway for the common squeaks and rattles since they are 100% easy to reproduce at my home area for a 10 mile radius. They ask me to go into the Service Center and require ME to find and reproduce the issue within a couple miles of the Service Center for their connivence. I have jumped thru all their hoops for 3 years and they won't do the simple fixes of just changing the low cost part which is obviously defective!

So while I understand this is your investment in a stock... I am not in your stock. I am a customer of the product which has failed and is not being repairs as per the terms of the original contract between Tesla and Me when I purchased this car for $80k in 2018"
2021-06-30 20:40:40,wallstreetbets,So they fix stuff electronically through an update?
2021-06-30 21:07:41,wallstreetbets,"Who says it is priced in? FSD if solved is worth a trillion or two at least. Maybe $100 of that share price reflects optimism about FSD.

Go read detailed valuation models for those who put them out, FSD is not that critical to the valuation. If anything, 4680 production is much more critical, IMO."
2021-06-30 22:34:50,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre looking at F like all their profitable models are ones that will be phased out over the next 5-10 years. Their only model that stands a chance are the F-150 lightning and Mache E Mustang and both are not profitable and both have terrible tech compared to what‚Äôs in a Tesla.
2021-06-30 20:12:43,wallstreetbets,"Who likes the traditional dealer network (other than dealers and maybe legacy automakers)?

I hate dealing with a dealer. Never know if you are getting the best available price. With Tesla, the price online is what it is. You might not like the price changes (which every auto maker does as well), but at least you know that there is not some middle man processing paperwork stiffing you."
2021-07-01 00:07:31,wallstreetbets,"Thats a fair statement, Who wants my spot for my cyber truck reservation? After my next appt with Tesla Service at Seaside, CA i'm going to cancel that reservation. No point in letting them hold my free money if I am not intending to buy Elon stuff any more."
2021-06-30 20:52:14,wallstreetbets,"Certain things yes, but i was referring to their mobile tech service, which can handle just about anything that doesn‚Äôt require a lift."
2021-06-30 22:42:24,wallstreetbets,"Models are always redesigned once or twice a decade. I imagine EV sales will start to take up more of Fords volume as that happens. Tesla's Model 3 (main seller) is also due for a redesign soon. 

What Ford has going for it is a legitimate infrastructure and a history of success. What it has going against it is a lot of debt. As Tesla scales up and has to add a real workforce and infrastructure their debt will also increase.

Tesla has the self driving wild card but I have to say everyone is catching up fast. Personally I think Tesla is probably worth 2x Ford mainly based on their tech, which would put their stock price around $150. Whether I'm right or not we'll have to wait for the next big correction to find out."
2021-06-30 20:18:26,wallstreetbets,OLDER people like having service and repair close. We hate dealers but we like having them
2021-07-01 00:19:01,wallstreetbets,Cancel it. You do you. I am hoping they come out with at some point a large SUV/Minivan with 5 or 6 seats in the rear (two benches) and decent storage space. The Model X is expensive and has minimal storage space after putting people in the back so not good for me. A good friend of mine has a CyberTruck reservation but he has less kids than me.

2021-07-01 00:24:17,wallstreetbets,"Short answer is yes they can be, but even had you preordered during the truck unveil you still probably wouldn‚Äôt get a first year model. My brother reserved a trimotor then and according to reservation trackers he‚Äôs still 47,000th in line."
2021-06-30 21:08:10,wallstreetbets,Old habits are hard to break. Not my feelings.   I have bought internet and had them delivered for some time. I never see my salesman half the time.  But Tesla has a market value higher than the whole industry ever had and they are facing competition going forward from some pretty darn good companies.  We will have choice and competition reduces profits.   Tesla has had execution problems  and Musk does not delegate well. 10 years from now they may be making far more from batteries than from cars.  Company is good but automotive industry was never worth this much so it concerns me.  If GOP retakes Congress expect the revenge of big oil.  Plus I still think electric vehicles will suffer as batteries need to be replaced. I see them as a stepping stone to hydrogen but I have 600k invested in a hydrogen player.
2021-06-30 20:24:46,wallstreetbets,"3 and Y. Funny you bring up BMW when I had to take my loaner back to the Enterprise TWICE because the check engine and low oil lights came on...in a beamer with less than 2,000 miles on it.

Those above issues were with my 3 minus the windshield replacement (wife hit a f'n cicada in the Y driving through Brood X country). But my 3 hasn't had any issues in the past two years and now has 50,000 miles on it already. Even in a toyota I would have spent more money on upkeep in the last few years than I have in either of my teslas. So far only thing I've paid for is a brake fluid flush at my local garage and $40 for a cabin air filter replacement I got done at the service center when they were upgrading the autopilot hardware on my 3."
2021-06-30 22:09:04,wallstreetbets,"There are lot of reasons why I think Telsa is way ahead of the competition and won't have much pressure for years to come, if ever. Don't want to get into a lengthy back and forth though so keeping it short.

As to the GOP and big oil it won't happen. The US auto industry needs EV support as otherwise they will fall further behind in EV's, while Tesla and VW push ahead. Protecting oil means throwing everyone but Tesla under the bus. Tesla will be fine as they are already committed to EV and should be sustainable regardless of credits.

As to batteries needing to be replaced... I suspect the 4680 cells will have no trouble lasting 15-20 years.

Regarding Hydrogen, it is not going to take over. VW as one example came out and said H2 is not in the future plans. It has some use cases, but it is not worth that much in terms of cars and even trucks."
2021-06-30 23:44:02,wallstreetbets,"I have a $50k 2015 sienna. The only cost for me on that vehicle has been dealership oil changes @ $60 each (I do them early @ 7500 miles instead of the full 10k miles).

I got 2 engine filters so far and 2 cabin filters so far in 88k miles. The sienna gets me 400 awd miles with full heater running or AC @ 80 mph when I drive from NorCal to SoCal and back often. Oh and I got a new set of tires at 40k miles and 80k miles. Thats about it... oh wait... I paid $500 in NY when I got the sienna to tint all windows at a shop called ""The Art of Tint"". Did Air Blue 80 for the entire windshield, Pinnacle F1 for front seat windows @ 15%, and F1 @ 50% on all the other glass including both sun roofs.

How much would it be to tint a model 3 with less total glass than a minivan??"

My favorite vehicle is my 2008 e90 335xi FBO which is comparable to the $80k P3D+ with the exception that.... the BMW can do 450 miles to a tank of gas @ 80 mph with the heater running in 5¬∞F temps in a fully packed/loaded vehicle. Did this often when I drove from NJ --> IL, NJ --> Canada (Niagara Falls), NJ --> MD, and now a days Northern California to Southern California.

Glad to hear you enjoy your minivan so much and sorry for ragging on beamers; BMWs forced my two good friends back to domestics.

2021-07-01 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why $AMC is ready to go ROCKET-MODE very soon. * Background:  We've made a +400% move, after which, we have seen an orderly pullback and consolidation with higher lows and tightening range in the consolidation phase.
* We are currently building a high tight flag, a schoolbook example of a potential breakout setup.
* The SMA20 has now caught up to the price. This is generally a good indicator that the stock is ready to move (in either direction).
* The 10SMA has been undercut multiple times - yet every time this has happened, the stock has managed to reclaim - this is a great sign of strength.
* Tightening range - Every day, it gets tighter and tighter. On top of that, the wicks get smaller and smaller. In other words, the Average Daily Range of the stock (ADR %) is decreasing. (Aka volatility). This is also a sign that it may be ready to move soon.

If $AMC breaks out of this flag on high volume - it will at least double, without a doubt.

Disclaimer: Slightly long, but YOLO once my alerts are triggered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Perfect Scenario:** 

1.) It goes sideways for a few more days

2.) Breakout on HIGH volume

3.) Profit

If not, I have my stop if we would close below the 20SMA

Price has been stagnant for the last 10 days.

They reported that they crushed earnings on 6/15. 1.54 (act) vs 1.185 (est)

that number isn't even in estimated range.

So why did it take a dump larger than the one you're taking while you read this DD?

Because history. You want some charts you lazy fucks?

2021-06-30 20:44:58,wallstreetbets,"The contracts with NASA, etc, are to test tech in low gravity not for satellite insertion. Key difference that people should understand. The contracts are worth a decent amount but with NASA I believe we are talking about $45M, so not enough to move the needle by itself.

Regarding hypersonic point-to-pint travel you have a major misconception here. Their spaceship is not capable of that. It does not achieve anything close to escape velocity and will not have sufficient fuel to fly a long distance (I guess you can take off from the coast, and land in the water a few miles away, and catch a boat the rest of the way). The Spaceship is an amusement, not a means of transport.

They are ""working"" on a hypersonic jet, which is very different form their spaceship, but best I can tell they have a long way to go to actually building a prototype."

2021-07-01 04:28:19,wallstreetbets,Love SPCE but it‚Äôs definitely not going to be worth $200 anytime soon. At around $65 the valuation would be higher than United Airlines. SPCE has one rocket that doesn‚Äôt even get into orbit
2021-06-30 22:53:41,wallstreetbets,What about the last accident? Lol
2021-07-01 12:09:05,wallstreetbets,"Virgin Orbit is essentially a rip off of the old Orbital Sciences Pegasus airplane launched rocket. The idea is to have a system in place that can launch small satellites rapidly on short notice, which is what the US Space Force and formerly the Air Force want. This partially is to provide a capability to rapidly replace satellites in orbit that malfunction or are destroyed in a conflict with a ""near peer"" adversary like China or Russia.   
Contrary to OP's statement, the VO and VG have practically nothing to do with each other in their present configurations. Virgin Orbit uses a Boeing 747 to launch a rocket mid-air in a similar manner to how USAF bombers launch cruise missiles. This is the same exact concept that Orbital Sciences used in its Pegasus rocket which also launches mid-air from a Lockheed L-1011 Stargazer. So why hasn't Pegasus dominated the small launch market? Because of its $40 million cost. While I don't see a published cost per launch for VO, apparently it is low enough to have won a contract to provide launches for the Space Force."
2021-07-01 10:24:01,wallstreetbets,United Airlines loses money to the tune of $22 a share and is not an industry disruptor or the first of its kind but suit yourself.
2021-07-01 08:20:56,wallstreetbets,You mean the last one that nearly broke the company when it was a private company back by an AD SWF... yes I know that well  Unfortunately society will see it differently if a ship explodes with 6-8 people (paying passengers) on board vs 1 test pilot..   Clearly hope that doesn't happen but it is a big risk. And quite different from airtravel
2021-07-01 16:19:45,wallstreetbets,"I think the VO launch was $12M. I agree with you. VO allows for a small launch at a low total cost. With SpaceX such a launch would only make sense if you are ride-sharing (I think they allowed to piggy-back on that for $1M), which might not be available, so you might be looking at 50-100M to launch otherwise. They both are relevant. Overall, I see SpaceX dominating the launch business for years to come, with VO and others  filling in the gaps."

For one BIG thing... their lead in tech is mostly due to paradigm shift, not just an incremental edge in different aspects of what was basically the same chip (ok, no, but you know what I'm saying).  If Intel is still so clueless as to stick with monolith arch, they're doomed, because it's all about the chip yield mon, all about the yield.

P.S.  Remember when Intel was pulling all their $12,000 silicon off the top shelf, and bleeding out the ass selling it for $2,000?  And AMD was making beaucoup bucks on $1,000 TR's.  So sweet, so sweet!  :D"

The Pryor factory is in a town of 9,000 people and is 30 minutes away from the next biggest town which has a population of 18,000.  It‚Äôs literally nowhere. Who will want to move to that area? How will they get 2,000 qualified employees? There‚Äôs also only about 100-150 homes and lots for sale in Pryor.

The size of the factory also doesn‚Äôt make sense. 1 million sq ft is less than 1/5 the size of Tesla‚Äôs Fremont factory. Tesla‚Äôs Reno factory is 1.8 million sq ft. 

Tesla has 70,000 employees and Canoo plans on having 2,000? 

By Canoo‚Äôs own estimates they will be out of cash before they even start production at their contract manufacturer. How are they going to pay for their first 16,000 pod-like turds and how are they going to pay for their factory in the middle of nowhere?"

2021-06-30 20:35:09,wallstreetbets,"In 2014 Tony tweeted and emoji of a Cow Fart and a Handshake as well... also if you noticed he was wearing blue jeans. Basically, what all this means, is that  even back then he had a master plan to produce EV's (save the world from the environmental impact of car farts) and he already was making deals back then that only now will come to fruition as evidenced by the current emojis. The blue jeans, well those are the same style that Ken the factory manager at Tyson Foods wears, which was meant to indicate that he had an agreement to source renewable animal materials from Tyson Foods, which also connects to the cow fart emoji.

Basically, these emojis are just a tip of the iceberg that reveal the deep and complex genius of Tony that has GOEV running circles around everyone else.

Just a caution, in 2016 he tweeted a some characters that resembled a drowning man, which might indicate that the Canoo will sink. No one is certain yet, and we are all eagerly waiting for the next tweet to connect the dots."

There will be listings for an entire box of tools for $10 and then you buy it and it turns out that you get sent one wrench worth about twenty cents, and they rigged the listing to not allow you to order the entire set.

2021-06-30 20:46:28,wallstreetbets,"So, I think The Big Short's approach was a considered a bit controversial during it's development band theater run. It was after most of the run when critics and writers started to realize that breaking the wall like they did and addressing the crowd directly really worked in a way that was far beyond what was hoped. We look back on it with that experience. At the time it still looked a little questionable. I think Margin Call deliberately left people in the dark because nobody on Wall Street knew what the fuck was happening. I think the writers wanted the viewer at least a little stumped about what was happening. They wanted you to experience the WTF that the banking industry started to feel. I don't think it worked too well for people that do not understand the MBS mechanics prior to watching the movie. Like has been stated, you need some background watching that movie. All you need with The Big Short is to know that shady shit happened in 2007."
2021-06-30 20:47:01,wallstreetbets,That is why you view the unofficial financial crisis trilogy in this order: The Big Short - Margin Call - Too Big To Fail
2021-06-30 23:44:41,wallstreetbets,"It wasn't as controversial to book fans, imo. I think every book fan's reaction to the announcement of the Big Short movie was half elation that it'll be adapted, half ""but HOW the hell could they adapt that?"" But one of Lewis's prime things is that he won't publish a book his mother (I think he uses his mom as the example layperson) wouldn't be able to understand, so the book *had* to do that if it wanted to adapt a Lewis financial book properly. (The sports books assume more knowledge in the reader's part, imo.) 

Still think it's a fantastic movie but the book is just so much better. Nobody does absurd humor like Lewis-- not and make you that angry at the same time. If he ranted it wouldn't be half as effective. (The movie also nails that feeling when the reader swings from pleasure at seeing the shorts succeed to feeling absolutely sick about what it means for them to be right.) 

I'm curious-- if TBS-- Margin Call-- Too Big to Fail is how you'd do movies, any readers out there want to suggest a similar list for books? I've been thinking that a TBS reread is in order, what else should I read? Especially any more current ones in what's happened since and what similar threats are coming?"

* Governments can print money to inflate or deflate currency/markets/spending at will.
* War in a foreign country leads to adjustments in military spending, aid relief spending, oil prices, supply chain ripples.
* Even a single ship getting stuck somewhere thousands of miles away on the other side of the world, can cause supply chains to get disrupted. (I.E. Suez Canal blockage)

There is no way to account for every single one of these events to figure out when exactly a bubble will burst.

That being said, the economy is almost certainly always going to grow, so as long as you don't need money in the near term, if you track the index funds, over the long term, no matter when you get in, you're likely always going to be ahead."

I'm no Michael Blurry, but here is how I see it.

Vaccination of us sheep is going along well, restrictions are being lifted.  Governments hate to work in summer, so probably September/October they will realise how fucked we are, and raise interest rates.  Next up, the Housing Market corrects because money isn't as free, and the smart money starts pulling out of the stock market.  The insanity of the derivatives market starts to crumble on its own leveraged weight.  Now us bag-holders watch as our investments lose value.  Fear of the big crash causes investors to pull out harder, creating a self fulfilling prophecy.  Our investments drop over 50% of their value, and the Reddit echo chamber tells us to buy the dip, only for it to keep dipping.

I don't actually have a play or Hedge against this.  My money is getting devalued by deflation, and my investments don't look good in the future I am expecting.  I think I just get to ride it out, because any move I make will be the wrong one."

The problem that people like Nassim Talib, Michael Burry and Cathy Wood run into is that they make extreme claims. When they are right, they look like prophets, when they are wrong, we dismiss their analysis. 

Burry COULD right if we face new [lockdowns](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/world/asia/australia-lockdown-delta.html) this summer due to the Delta and Delta + variant as we are already seeing in Asia. I hope President Harris does NOT follow their example.

The other reason he could be right is hyperinflation. Our money supply is out of wack and most US dollars are [outside](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/central-banker/spring-2007/how-us-currency-stacks-upat-home-and-abroad) the US. Massive onshoring of US Dollars for reduced petrodollar recycling or inflation causing foreign governments to see it as less of a hard currency could tank our economy and take most others with it.

2022 with a rise of interests rate could slow down the (possibly) coming inflation and the rise of the stock market, but will it indue a big crash ? Maybe just a correction that will be stopped by injecting money again after freezing interest rate to avoid a crash. 

  
2024 with election POTUS makes sense if there is a switch of party.  


2008 saw democrats win over republican so a foresaw switch by the market in financial/economic/taxes policy was  maybe the trigger for the crash given that the new democrat administration could try to stop the madness about these ultra overvalued subprime mortgages (and others ponzi scheme like Madoff).

  
If 2024 bring us a new administration that could try to stop some coming inflation, the stock market could really crash hard and all the financial system with it because the solution to inject money (help/QE/repo) to feed the economy (implying inflation) followed by raising interest rate (to stop inflation) would have failed and maybe even worsed the situation.

With bad debt if it can't be paid it goes bad, with an overpriced stock it can stay over valued for as long as people keep buying and others don't sell there is no point at which people have to sell or payments can't be made and it all goes bust(provided they are solvent) Also the dude just uses yield curve inversions and waits 6 months to say anything about market crashes.

He said the flows will reverse at some point, and ‚Äúit will be ugly‚Äù when they do.""

To his defense, if not for the banks getting $400 billion infused to make it through X-mas 2019, (that no one even bothered noticing) and then virus happened+mass money printing, then Burry would been right on the money."

Burry was lucky.

2021-07-01 01:00:39,wallstreetbets,"This ""bubble"" is caused entirely by the Federal Reserve's actions.  In that sense, the timing that the bubble will pop will be extremely predictable.

The Fed has created unfathomable amounts of new money; in the form of credit, but still money none-the-less.  [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)

The vast majority of the new money created went to American big businesses that had close ties to the banking sector.

With so much new money in the market, inflation of everything was inevitable.  This CAN be undone, quite simply if that line on the graph flatlines for a bit.  (Stop expanding the current money supply.)  We just need to let the economy and our real economic output GROW into the newly expanded money supply.

So it is impossible for him to ever be wrong by this logic. Eventually the market will crash. The thing is it probably won‚Äôt crash below where it was when he started predicting it anymore so he will functionally be wrong even when it does crash‚Ä¶. But by your logic him being wrong is a factual impossibility, his timing can only be off.

What you should care about: does following his claims yield profit? If you have listened to his doom and gloom claims over the past 4 years, then absolutely fucking not is the answer.

2021-07-01 07:10:41,wallstreetbets,"German factories weren't bombed to rubble but they were basically all shuttered because Germany was also being forced to pay (like pay in the form of currency and it's native resources) for world war 1, that the major thing that put stress on it's resources and led to inflation, not it printing too much money. The printing came AFTER it was already in a really shit situation and a shot ton of debt delineated in currencies it didn't control and resources it didn't have an unlimited amount of or access to."
2021-07-01 06:05:05,wallstreetbets,The age of reserve currency will come to a very quick end unless this printing press is stopped. In Just 20 years Chinese economy went from being 1/10th of US economy to same size. Do you think anyone will give a crap to $$ when China controls 40% of world economy?
2021-07-01 09:58:29,wallstreetbets,So if everything crashes we get WW3? Gee I wonder why Burry got to that conclusion.
2021-07-01 16:51:17,wallstreetbets,"Can't allow deflation, if deflation, then value of money goes up, then becomes harder to pay off debt, since all money is loaned into existence, that is a bid debt that is hard to pay off, and deflation if the enemy of the state. Only way forward is to print ever more money to pay off existing debt. If it up to policy makers to choose between deflation and inflation, they will always choose inflation."
2021-06-30 21:54:18,wallstreetbets,"honestly find the most self-sufficient economy you can. If America goes down it's taking everybody with it, even places with insane control like china."
2021-07-01 16:30:04,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure a vestigial congress will stick around to rubber stamp things, just like it did in Rome and Germany."
2021-07-01 02:04:18,wallstreetbets,"That's... kinda the point. The Big Mac and McDonalds business model is one of the most uniform and comparable worldwide and over time.

So if a big mac is $10 in an US state, ‚Ç¨5 in Portugal and 1000 yen in Japan, you can use that to give a rough estimation that those have about equivalent purchasing power in their local economies.

*Edit* or similarly, if it was $5 10 years ago an $10 now that means that 100% inflation has happened."
2021-06-30 22:09:46,wallstreetbets,"Housing market is pretty on fire right now, not sure what you‚Äôre looking at. Could it crash? Well that‚Äôs a different discussion, but you can‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs not booming as of the moment. I would also argue paying rent endlessly to not own anything is foolish. It pained me to pay month after month rent on an apartment
I couldn‚Äôt truly treat as my own. Probably depends on the situation but to me having ownership holds more weight."
2021-07-01 00:02:21,wallstreetbets,"Original question was about ""feel"""
2021-07-01 07:21:44,wallstreetbets,You asked me if they feel wealthier. I gave you a survey about how wealthy people feel.
2021-07-01 09:18:53,wallstreetbets,"I was literally just trying to ride the wave. Just regret not going long on any stocks.  

My friend asked ""should we buy these $PENN Jan 2022 $5c trading at $3.5?"" I said ""are you retard, no one is going to a casino any time soon.""

We could have been rich."
2021-07-01 04:02:18,wallstreetbets,"No, being too early in the stockmarket is the same as being wrong . You lose money either way. 

Of course, ultimately you're right but nobody cares if you don't make money."
2021-06-30 21:25:51,wallstreetbets,Well let's hope. I am up a good 300 percent but I have barely broke a grand.
2021-06-30 20:24:11,wallstreetbets,Why are you so üåà
2021-06-30 21:36:07,wallstreetbets,"Your prices are about 14 months old my dude, you can barely find any 800 sqft homes in the rural southeast for under 60k right now much less 1500 sqft"
2021-07-01 17:38:18,wallstreetbets,"And by your logic if we would‚Äôve halted population, say 50 years ago, it would‚Äôve been 30% of that number.  Now think about your question."
2021-07-01 02:24:28,wallstreetbets,Well holding highly leveraged short position on the most stable asset in history doesn't sound risk-free does it? I may have missed the point perhaps because you're not really making one.
2021-06-30 20:08:24,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm fairly sure unless we start mining space rocks like soon our collapse is imminent, we don‚Äôt produce nearly enough compared to what we consume

2021-06-30 23:04:47,wallstreetbets,Inflation never has to hit.
2021-07-01 07:20:49,wallstreetbets,That won't ever happen. There's no reason it should
2021-07-01 10:54:57,wallstreetbets,"Allies seized the Ruhr in Germany, after WWI. This led to a huge reduction in industrial capacity. Combine that with Germany printing money at the time, without the economic resources to back up the money and you get Germay's hyperinflation."
2021-07-01 07:20:00,wallstreetbets,Says who? The printing press never has to stop. There's no reason it should. Inflation isn't a problem.
2021-06-30 21:56:50,wallstreetbets,Self sufficient economy? Hmm gonna research
2021-07-01 07:53:01,wallstreetbets,"agree with your edit and its applicable to america, but certainly not in all of the aforementioned countries, especially japan. mcds will run you less than in the u.s., thus why i think it is a bad metric. (and even worse one when you compare if to actual food as i said...sit down restaurants for $10-15 are far and few in america.) my point being, the american notion of ""no inflation"" is high bs."
2021-06-30 20:51:33,wallstreetbets,I didn‚Äôt realize transportation was behind too. Thanks for your insightful reply!
2021-07-01 09:27:48,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not what the survey measures. It measures how comfortable they will be spending in the near future.

2021-06-30 21:42:55,wallstreetbets,Turns out it‚Äôs the past 12 years combined. (Article says past 5 months referring to December 2020- April 3021.)
2021-07-01 10:14:53,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but that‚Äôs exactly what happened in Burrys case. He closed out short positions - ultimately got the timing correct, was vindicated with billions in profit."
2021-06-30 21:28:12,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs great! If you can average 300% again next year you‚Äôre at $4,000. Once more at 300% $16,000. You can see - also as you go you‚Äôll become more skilled. Good luck"
2021-06-30 21:13:12,wallstreetbets,Born that way.
2021-07-01 17:48:29,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but now we are nearing a sort of carrying capacity for population with food and water"
2021-07-01 07:39:28,wallstreetbets,The whole point it is his position was extremely risky. What are you talking about?
2021-06-30 20:34:09,wallstreetbets,"Eh, petro dollar and military-indust complex allows us to do shit most countries can‚Äôt.

The only real threat is if a country like China starts having a stronger currency and military than the US. Not today but they may in the future."
2021-06-30 23:06:27,wallstreetbets,Just laying out a scenario where ‚Äúthis can‚Äôt go on forever‚Äù.
2021-07-01 03:43:00,wallstreetbets,"Even if infaltion doesn't hit, printing trillions that you are giving out to cooperations, who lay off thousands of people regardless and pay their CEOs millions, all while the wealth gap is never increasing will lead to trouble.

Also inflation has been hitting since the dollar has been taken of the gold standard, hyperinflation hasn't hit yet, but it will eventually.
I reckon, that it will take a few more years to come, I think a big trigger event would be the OPEC Staates being able to trade oil without using the us dollar.
Or if the us looses the coming world war against china/ Russia, if you look how far spread the US military is I can see them loosing on multiple fronts, or winning and then having depleted most of their resources in terms of money and man power"
2021-07-01 09:36:27,wallstreetbets,"In the short term you're right, but if the US continues to debase the dollar by reckless printing, other countries are less incentivised to hold on to US treasuries. You see China and other countries calling for the use of a different reserve currency. When China overtakes the US as the largest economy, how long before those calls are taken more seriously"
2021-07-01 08:12:11,wallstreetbets,You will go with wheelbarrow  full of dollars to buy bread. You think Chinese are going to accept your worthless dollars rather than let US go bankrupt and take over the country.
2021-07-01 17:06:10,wallstreetbets,A distinction without a difference.
2021-07-01 06:25:40,wallstreetbets,Thanks man!!
2021-07-01 18:21:57,wallstreetbets,"Bro that‚Äôs a different topic.  We are saying, all else held constant, population halt or reduction = bad for stock market."
2021-07-01 09:41:59,wallstreetbets,What I'm saying is that what he did in order to get a 400% return is really not that impressive because it was so risky.  I'm saying that even some kid who yolo'd into nio would get 600% return yet is not lauded as one of the greatest visionaries of investing.

2021-06-30 23:05:09,wallstreetbets,"You caught the part where India is going to execute a world health organization offical for lying right. Lying about a working super cheap covid cure that could have saved tons of people. Ivermectin. Hydroxychloroquin also not only prevents but cures the virus. I think the firing squad in India is going to take care of the official regardless of the muddying of the waters that the social media platforms and large news outlets have been doing. If you are not seeing any information that challenges your current preconceived views on the topic than you might be living in an echo chamber. In which case anything I proffer up to you as an alternative viewpoint will be easy for you to dismiss as hearsay. I‚Äôm not even trying to be mean about this here but honestly I am probably the person who cares the least about changing your views in this subject. I merely came here to comment on a stock that I really like and believe in, which is Ocugen I have been holding a few hundred shares that I bought for less than a dollar each years ago. I could sell now and walk away with a huge profit margin but I really believe in this stock and i really like it. I really liked it before covid was a thing. And I really like their OCU 400 drug. I really like that they are going straight for approval with their safe and well proven and traditional vaccine approach. And i really think people who have jumped on the MRNA vaccine bandwagon did so out of a different kind of FOMO. It is the same basic concept but slightly different and I think much in the same way many of these people who FOMO‚Äôd and skeeted a bunch of unproven wonder juice into their bodies might be left proverbial bagholders in the end here.

I don‚Äôt care about changing you mind. I think Ocugen is an awesome deal right now and will only make me tons of money in the future and I did good DD and got in one the basement levels below the ground floor."

Well me personally I keep an eye out on beat up stocks and watch them. Ex airlines. Finally a green day

Im also scanning 424s etc for stocks to short for example it gave me viac before it cratered and now ccl  which always runs up for 3 days after a dilution then dumps. Im hawking that

I also keep an eye out on the sc13s to see what hedgies are doing and make a watchlist with a date to see which starts pumping and which starts dumping. I enter accordingly. Thats how i caught tell

Next I keep my ears on the news and which sectors might run up and wait for the markets to react then I ride the wave.

Next im always keeping an eye out for overbought stocks and look to short ex amd. Waiting on a divergence 

I try not to advertise plays because I cannot  üêª the thought of someone losing money because they followed me. I did that on the ship and regretted it every fucking time. No use in causing someone else harm

2021-06-30 22:51:54,wallstreetbets,"For myself, buying random shit based on charts has been basically a really stressful breakeven approach.  I need to stop doing it but it's very exciting when it works out.

My most consistent returns have been from industries that I know very well and understand how they make money....believe it or not.  The sporting goods industry has been good to me over the past year (ASO, DKS, UAA, big five), the oil industry (BKR, SLB, XOM, NRGU), banks (MS, AXP, DFS, SOFI) and solar (SPWR)

I spend a lot of time look at screeners and charts but at the end of the day I really only make money on businesses that are making money and running due to current economic and market conditions.  The macro approach for me is boring but it works.  

I lose money buying random shit, and memes, aside from GME."

I got a year older this week, have been eating cake for breakfasts while trying to make up for it by doing extra workout. Have been thinking about if maybe it‚Äôs indeed the right time to have a kid and related things as we complete three years of being married this weekend. Watched barefoot joe, was tragic but nice.

2021-07-01 10:14:51,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm sitting on a 4% loss too. But I actually like the stock long term as a small part of my portfolio. Direct manufacture to consumer platform with their shipping and logistics business dreams like a decent play!
2021-07-01 10:15:38,wallstreetbets,I completely agree I‚Äôm holding for a while.
2021-07-01 10:26:49,wallstreetbets,"My big concern for them though is the absolute garbage they shouldn‚Äôt allow on their site. 

These ‚Äúbullet proof‚Äù vests I am seeing cannot be real and a threat to consumers dumb enough to do something. 

Scrolling through and all of a sudden getting ads for dildos, absurd sex toys and bongs. 

This doesn‚Äôt make their platform look great. 

But it is fascinating that like 70-80% of sale come from scrolls through the site suggesting more fun shopping. 

Some of their shipping due to mail deals is cheaper to ship from day China to a state then it is to ship from state to state. 

But that also presents a risk it changes. 

What are your threats and opportunities you are watching?"
2021-07-01 10:29:33,wallstreetbets,I completely agree about that stuff I don‚Äôt think they should be having that shit on their platform but I find it amazing that they analyze what you buy and how much you pay for certain things and based on that they‚Äôll decide to market an item to you as $10+free shipping or $3+$7 shipping.
2021-07-01 10:46:11,wallstreetbets,"But with all that said I have no idea what Wish thinks about me I guess I‚Äôve never made a purchase but they send me normal ads like grills, cologne bla bla but when I get on the app it‚Äôs like bullet proof shields and vests, tasers, iced out jewelry, tactical lights, police sticks, knives, lasers, shirt gun holders. 

I mean they be thinking I‚Äôm going to war!

Ya very cool stuff. I think at their price and their growth will be interesting to see as a long term play. 

I‚Äôve grown intrigued by some of the platforms helping businesses go to customers digitally. 

Shopify, Global-E and Wish are all interesting. 

Where I feel Amazon tries to remove the business from the picture all together Shopify and Global focus on the business to customer relationship. 

Wish is kind of in a different way but creating that direct to consumer shipping platform for low cost products is interesting to say the least!"

2021-07-01 11:58:59,wallstreetbets,"But why...? Lmao.

I stalked your profile a bit and you seem kinda new to trading. In my opinion, you're trying to force a theta play where it's not really attractive. Premiums aren't high relative to their average pricing, and they're not high nominally, either. If commission is as high as 5% on some of these trades (ie $1 commission for $20 max profit), and assuming you're losing a dollar or two in liquidity, it's a really, *really* difficult and convoluted way to make 15 to 20 dollars.

When I first learned about writing options, I wanted to write premium for everything because I thought it was the 200 IQ play. Positive theta, baby! But now, I think of it as one tool in a toolbox. There are different occasions for selling to open, buying to open, buying shares, or staying away (sometimes the best move). For the buying power you're using, really consider if this worth the grind.

I added another 100 shares and might be looking at some of the $10 calls in Jan 2022 if they drop a little."
2021-07-01 10:20:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, 90% on my calls, 12% on shares. Still gonna hold. Shortage will squeeze WTI to 80+ since OPEC is only phasing in output. Best outcome of the meeting for those bullish on energy related stocks."
2021-07-01 12:17:50,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been in the market since maybe 2016 which was the soonest I legally could be. I was mainly doing throw it in an ETF and leave it, which is nice, but I‚Äôm not 60. Hence why little to no trading forum activity. 

Looking from a return perspective, I get over $20 for a 4.5p expiring in 2 weeks after commission, so just over 5%. Seems like a pretty solid return on capital for that time period. But, I‚Äôm always up for learning new stuff and seeing what other have to say, which is exactly why I posted this. Tear me up, tell me I‚Äôm wrong and why or that I‚Äôm trading like an actual retard, I‚Äôve got time to learn. I‚Äôd rather make a few account busting mistakes while I‚Äôm young and have time.

‚ÄúDuring the current housing bubble, more than 200 corporations and investment firms are in the housing hunt. J.P. Morgan Asset Management and BlackRock Inc are among the biggest players, competing against everyday Americans in search of their first home.‚Äù

It‚Äôs also 100 percent of their portfolio diversity, which being at a 35k+ loss scream ‚Äúdesperation‚Äù. If 100 percent of an $800,000 portfolio is dug into one contract, they‚Äôre going to be desperate to earn back losses. The sell isn‚Äôt going to be for 100 dollars.

2021-07-01 17:55:55,stocks,"Learning to read pre-market moves and volume increases is probably one of the more important things about day trading to learn. The thing about your post is that you said ‚Äúdaily swings of $1-$3.‚Äù $1-$3 can be a 20% move for one stock and .5% for another. And you said ‚Äúswing‚Äù obviously knowing it goes both ways. Reliably earning X amount daily in trading is impossibly difficult. To successfully day trade you have to be extremely patient, extremely selective, extremely strict on your bankroll, and extremely ungreedy. Once you master that, you‚Äôll win more than you lose. Before even attempting to day trade I would recommend taking months and years to work on swing trading. If you really want some passive income and have a decent bankroll - selling covered calls is a great start (you really only stand to lose possible gains and realized gain taxes)."
2021-07-01 17:55:20,stocks,"The larger your account is, the easier it will be to make a profit. If you have $1,000, you‚Äôd need 20% gains every day. $10,000? You‚Äôd need 2% gains every day. Also yes try the r/DayTrading mentioned below.

2021-07-01 17:45:21,stocks,"Most people are telling you to ignore short-term volatility, and I think they‚Äôre generally right. 

However, if you‚Äôre concerned about your losses so far you may want to reassess your investing strategy. Do you have a process for screening stocks and diving deep into the ones you‚Äôre interested in? Do you have a fair grasp on a company‚Äôs financial statements and can identify trends in their revenue, profit, free cash flow, shares outstanding,  etc.? Do you have a qualitative sense on the future plans of the company and how they‚Äôre executing that over the next few years? 

These are the kind of questions to ask and the subject matter you should be researching before investing in a stock. I‚Äôm not saying you have or haven‚Äôt done these things, but short term losses early in your investing career can be an opportunity to grow and learn more about the stock market. 

As you continue to develop and fine tune your process over time, I think you‚Äôll grow more confident in your portfolio and be willing to endure the short term rumblings of the market."

More homework is to know more about the direction of the company. For my major YOLO plays, I'm not at all concerned about a day's red movement. As long as no news materially impacts the direction or performance of the company, then deep red days are buying opportunities. 

* One of my positions was red by $over $8K a few weeks ago. I kept following them and didn't see any valid reason why it was down, so I kept buying. I don't expect its significant movement to begin for another couple months, and it should take more than a year. (It's back up to almost even now.) 
* Another of my positions doesn't allow for that. It's a play I'm in because I expect earnings at the end of the month, combined with the outlook for the rest of the year, to move the stock upward by mid- to late-August. If this ever reaches any more than 5 or 7 percent below where I've bought, then I can only assume I missed something or the market has fundamentally changed its valuation of the company and it's time to get out. 

In both of these cases, red days with no news don't bother me in the least, because I have a firm understanding of my timeline and my tolerance for fluctuation in the meantime."

>By shutting out refuting evidence, we become vulnerable to overoptimism that our chosen stocks will flourish. Wall Street encourages this tendency because anyone can buy a stock, while only owners can sell. Buy recom- mendations far outnumber sells. For estimates of a company‚Äôs earnings more than a year out and long-term growth rates, reality chronically falls short. **Declining earnings are rarely forecast but often occur.** This does not apply to predictions of the next two quarters, which, if anything, are slightly low. **Companies and analysts tacitly collude to create quarterly ‚Äúupside surprises.‚Äù** (p. 21)"

Buffet recommends picking roughly 7 companies that are phenomenal businesses, giving you the best probability of outperforming the market. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook fit this description.

It‚Äôs just a matter of having the proper industry knowledge so you know where the industry is going and if these companies will have a relevant, growing position in society moving forward.

>At the very top of the list, we did a paper called ""Top Dogs"" that looked at the largest market capitalization stocks in each sector, in each country, and the worldwide top dog, which today is Microsoft. What we found is that the top dog in any sector--and this is a global phenomenon; we tested it in eight developed economies around the world--the number-one stock in each sector on average underperforms by 5% per year compounded over the next 10 years relative to its own sector.

2021-07-01 17:54:00,stocks,"Because it's more likely that one of those companies does down than the entire economy. And also because market growth tends to be driven by a handful of stocks (like 2 or 3) percent, while most stocks underperform the market. So your choices will probably underperform the market. 

The thing is, these companies can be great companies and be successful but underperform their prices. A great company is not that good to own-- and will probably underperform the market-- if it is priced like a great company. Buying index funds gives you a good chance at capital appreciation in the long run, and for the reasons I just said, probably a better chance than those big companies. On the other hand, index funds seriously protect your downside versus owning 10 stocks.

Another way of looking at it: if you want to really outperform the market, it doesn't make much sense to choose a handful of US mega-caps, since their performance has a massive impact on indexes already. So if you expect them to do well, and you invest in the SP500, and you are correct that they will do well, you already caught most of that upside, just with much less downside. If you really want to outperform the market, then, try to focus on companies with massive growth potential (yes, Apple has growth potential, but 10x?? no way) or with seriously low valuations."

2021-07-01 17:38:22,stocks,"For my own knowledge can you please provide some examples of the too big to fail companies you've mentioned?

My reasoning is that large companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon have diversified revenue streams that you can't just classify them as just tech companies.

3) the whole point of what I said is that you can't predict what will outperform what. and the premise of your point is that you can, which is wrong. 

4) even if tech performs as well as you think it will, there is no predicting which tech companies account for that performance. could be apple and microsoft, but it could be like biotech and AI. There's no telling, which is why you buy index funds, which guarantee exposure to outperformers.

But compound growth is killer if the business continues to rapidly expand year over year. It would also make up more of the S&P as well though to be fair, which favors index investing in terms of optimal risk-reward). 

2. OP was talking about the top 10 companies by market cap which is all big tech other than Johnson & Johnson, and Berkshire Hathaway. They named Microsoft, Apple, and Visa off-hand. 

3. I Hate this crystal ball argument, of course the future is impossible to 100% predict. That‚Äôs why you pick financially healthy companies with great growth prospects and economic moats. You invest in companies that give you the highest probability of outperforming the market. It‚Äôs obvious a company like Microsoft is likely going to outperform a mid-cap company such as Texas Roadhouse. Just as how I can‚Äôt guarantee I won‚Äôt be alive tomorrow. But I have a higher chance of living if I pay attention while driving a car vs texting while driving. 

4. You don‚Äôt just invest in one company. You invest in a handful of individual stocks that you expect to have a high probability of beating the market (Buffet and Lynch recommend 7-15 roughly). People should only do this if they know what they are doing. The average person should stick to indexes if they are not willing to do the research of course. 

I‚Äôm not disagreeing with index investing as much as I want to highlight that beating the market isn‚Äôt this absurdly, low probability phenomenon people want to believe that it is. OP has the right premise for a high probabilistic chance to beat the market."

2021-07-01 18:39:49,stocks,"Beating the market isn't rare, but doing so over the long run on a risk adjusted basis is. It sounds like you get that. My issue is with number 3: picking profitable stong moat high growth business as a rule will not be highly successful. The reason is that companies like that are super expensive to invest in. People often think about investing in companies in a manner that divorces them from their price. Great companies are often not great investments. Even if they perform well as a company (which is easy to predict, as you say) it does not follow that they will perform well as a stock. The tech bubble from 20 years ago is a great example of that: Microsoft was a great company back then (and there was occasion to project it forward), no doubt, but not a great investment considering its price. Would you rather pay a PE ratio of 1 for texas roadhouse or 1000 for microsoft? An obnoxious example, but illustrative nonetheless: you're investing in a company for a price, not in a vaccuum, and the price you pay determines the quality of the investment, not the performance of the company. Better to own bad companies at good values than good companies at bad values. Relating this to OP, they might end up doing the second of these (not saying that those are at bad prices, just that they could be)."

And this was in a quarter when retail trading was frenzied as hell.

Well, make no mistake: this company sucks at doing business. Robinhood may be awesome at making UI, and may even be awesome at revolutionizing the entire industry. But I doubt any of you want to sponsor this revolution from your own pockets as shareholders, and without it this revolution will quickly fizzle."

2021-07-01 17:18:34,stocks,"Their UI advantage will be eroded or erased by Fidelity in the next 6 months based on the rate of change we've seen in the beta of their app, and the revolutionizing goes as far as encouraging other brokers to drop commissions on trades, which is already done. 

RH got a lot of people to own their first stock at cost (via paying them a stock) which came out of VC funding most likely, and now Fidelity is going to benefit from that promotional effort due to all of the people RH brought into the market who've now transferred over to them. That number is in the millions of users per quarter that RH paid to acquire, and then lost to a better-funded competitor with broader capabilities. Additionally, the business model itself (PFOF) is under scrutiny. Fidelity can survive and probably not even lose income if PFOF gets made illegal tomorrow, RH would be dead in a month. 

These are not things that lend themselves to a successful investment. A good trade? Maybe, maybe not. I would not trust the numbers they are putting out even as far as a day trade goes for the IPO. Insiders are trying to cash out fast and will have no hesitation to leave buyers holding the bag."

2021-07-01 17:59:57,stocks,I've been successfully implementing that strategy for years yet somehow I have yet to make any profits
2021-07-01 18:53:52,stocks,"You laugh, but spend enough time around the stock subs and you'll see plenty of ""I bought xyz ticker yesterday and now it's down 1.5% so I sold. Wooo. Avoided the oncoming crash that obviously just started."" 

I'm exaggerating a tad for a chuckle, but really some people do need to be reminded that you aren't actually supposed to buy high and sell low."
2021-07-01 14:25:59,stocks,"This is true, if one already has food for bait."
2021-07-01 13:59:49,stocks,I honestly wish it happens i would stack so much more
2021-07-01 18:58:35,stocks,It can depend. If a 1.5% dip was not expected then their short term investment theory may be invalidated so they dump it. For example you may look at previous patterns and think the stock will jump 10%  over a week. But if it instead dips by a certain amount then your stock analysis may be off or incorrect. You aren‚Äôt sure where it will go and don‚Äôt want to baghold so you dump.
2021-07-01 19:18:17,stocks,"I suppose I was looking at more long term investing with that comment. If you go into a purchase planning for a decade plus hold, like its ridiculous to back out because of normal day to day fluctuations immediately after purchase. But there's certainly been comments and posts in the vain of ""I saw red and slammed the sell button."" 

But yes. If we zoom down to much shorter time scales, it can make a lot of sense to dump after being down 1.5%. I swing trade on the side and often exit a trade at a loss."
2021-07-01 14:57:24,stocks,Could be just hedging puts. PayPal will deliver strong results for sure. its my largest holding as well. Dan is done a good job since the company went public(after splitting from EBAY). I could see this provide market beating returns over next 5 years as well. I would ignore short term moves.
2021-07-01 13:32:14,stocks,It‚Äôs my second largest holding. It‚Äôs a strong company fundamental wise with great growth prospects. I‚Äôm chilling.
2021-07-01 19:36:00,stocks,"Over 350 million active users, with the ability to raise fees to vendors. Sure the stock isn‚Äôt cheap and may pull back a bit, but it‚Äôs certainly going higher over the next year."

2021-07-01 13:40:48,stocks,I‚Äôm wondering if this is just a bank hedge
2021-07-01 16:09:28,stocks,"I‚Äôve been thinking the same. But if it keeps ripping at .5% a day, a 5% pull back (which would be huge) brings us right to where we are now. So I can‚Äôt justify selling."
2021-07-01 16:08:11,stocks,that would be my play too Whitehoney88 (love the nickname!)
2021-07-01 16:13:15,stocks,yea. good point. i sold to go into $CLF on infrastructure news and Bill passage in senate
2021-07-01 16:08:39,stocks,Thank you! So you‚Äôd hold?
2021-07-01 16:14:19,stocks,Ahh yes. Been eying clf. Don‚Äôt sleep on V. It‚Äôs due for a major rip also!
2021-07-01 16:11:45,stocks,"sold from my regular account. will buy in Roth account, hopefully on pullback at better entry point.  But i see it as a huge disruptor to the banks...i would NOT buy the banks...my favorite fintech are $PYPL and $SQ as 3+ years hold and DCA"

2021-07-01 14:48:50,stocks,"The explanation given in the below article I read makes the most sense. Walmart has been buying back shares, which had driven up their ownership percentage. They in turn have been selling shares to bring their percentage back down.

2021-07-01 13:44:37,stocks,"Could be nothing other than they want to move their money into places where they see higher growth. Ultimately, it‚Äôs a bearish sign for their retailer which has struggled to penetrate into e-commerce and will likely be facing higher wage costs in the near future, along with looming threats of trade wars with China which may impact them harder than some other retailers.

I doubt we‚Äôre seeing the collapse of Wal-mart or anything, but it could be a sign that they expect to see less growth from their own holdings versus redeploying that capital into other areas."
2021-07-01 13:58:30,stocks,Those were sales from a family trust that includes both of them rather than 2 individual sales although each of them did also sell some of their personal shares (Alice ~6.75m and Jim ~10.5m).

2021-07-01 13:51:14,stocks,I think you hit the nail on the head. They are seeing the COVID reopening tapering and the looming inflation pressure and so are moving some funds into possibly higher performing or more stable assets.

2021-07-01 14:44:46,stocks,Selling at all time highs to lock in some profit for whatever might unfold next year or two. I don‚Äôt see many other assets as stable as Walmart and don‚Äôt know where they can deploy a billion or so into higher performers at this stage in the market cycle
2021-07-01 16:52:07,stocks,You really think they are chasing aggressive growth with billions?  Not capital preservation?
2021-07-01 19:05:40,stocks,From what I've heard about the Walton's they don't strike me as the type to make large charitable donations. Hey I hope I'm wrong though that would be cool.

Internally as well as 3rd party contracts. I see WMT lagging behind, and eventually collapsing purely due to corporate mismanagement, unless they get out of their own way. They've tried to do this by dissolving and hiring out their maintance depts. Only they refuse to be reliant on 3rd parties so they are attempting to copy the systems of 3rd parties, to great failure. They're stubborn, and often dumb. I hope they succeed though, I've got nothing against the business model."

the original stocks from the S&P 500 have out-performed the index after all the changes (an average of ~20 stocks are traded in and out per year). http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.421.7832

I am glad I own shares of VOO, but I am still expecting a pullback in 2021 that will erase much of the gains. Biotech is the place I am looking in terms of attempting to strike gold, but this year especially the VOO has moved up like AMC at times!!!

The world has changed and access to the stock market and information has become far more accessible to people and therefore more money can come into the market so I think it makes sense that the modern average would be higher than the average when you also include data from 60 years ago.

Plus, we are in a bull market right now. Eventually there will be another bear market and that will bring the modern average back down a bit."
2021-07-01 15:52:47,stocks,"And I learned the hard way 20 years ago that a market (NASDAQ) can crash to the tune of 75% over an 18 month period. It took a lot of up years to get that crash back to 8% average.

That is why there are runs UP and CRASHES down - one good crash takes a while to recover back to the 8% average.

And like everything what goes up must come down.

I have enjoyed this run up as much as anyone but I would not be spending all these gains right now you will need them eventually."

There are many different rates you can calculate based on the same data set and people tend to just call any and all of them ""average growth"". Depending on the time frames used it can vary significantly but the most realistic long-term estimates are usually around:

- 7.5% CAGR (compounded growth rate, useful for calculating long term expected growth but useless for short term averages) this is usually where the 8% comes from

- 10% average growth (mean of all YOY growth figures, useful for benchmarking year to year but not suitable for compounding calculations) this number even more so than others is heavily variable based on the time range used since the range is massive (like -50 to +40) and it's a simple mean.

- 11%+ when taking total growth and diving by years (useful mainly for inflating your numbers to customers, also to emphasize the benefits of staying in the market for a long time because this number will increase as the total duration increases is CAGR stays the same)."

2021-07-01 12:56:32,stocks,"If you want to grow your position I don't think it makes much sense to sell anything.

If you want to take some out you could take out  the original investment so you just have house money left.

Otherwise trimming it back down to the $100 you want to have invested sounds fine.

I've done both of those for different reasons. Sometimes I take my original investment out and sometimes I trim it to a certain dollar amount.

If you want to still own ford in 3-5 years then it probably doesn't make sense to take anything out. If it was just something you saw value in that you were always planning to sell when it was priced better then maybe take profit."
2021-07-01 12:56:42,stocks,"Nobody has ever lost money taking a profit. How much you sell is really going to depend on your own conviction for the stock. There are many ways to go about it. You *could* sell everything except the principal or trim your position and sell a few shares every once and awhile as it goes up. Selling almost everything would mean you either have lost belief in the company's future, you feel it's overvalued, or you feel that there is a better opportunity elsewhere for your money. But why sell if you don't need the money in the near term and you have a firm belief in the stock and where it's at currently? At the end of the day, trimming a little bit off your position to lock in some profits won't hurt you, just don't look back at it later with regret. Hindsight is 20/20. So what made financial sense today might wind up completely different 3 years from now."
2021-07-01 12:54:44,stocks,"I mean. If you pull profits and then continue to buy shares in the same stock that kind of doesn‚Äôt make sense. Unless you trying to swing trade by pulling the profit and reinvesting it in a dip. Like selling shares of Fordl at $10 and then buying them back at $9. You can increase your position in that way without investing more money.

Usually people wait for a stock to go up and then pull out their original investment amount to reinvest somewhere else. This would leave you with 85$ of free Ford stock that you just sit on forever or let it grow and pull it out later."

source: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/business/dealbook/robinhood-fine-ipo.html

___

Robinhood clears the decks for its I.P.O.
Robinhood racked up another big fine yesterday, this time from the financial industry regulator known as FINRA. It‚Äôs the latest blow to the online brokerage, which has faced a series of accusations of misleading and marooning customers. But the company sees an upside to its latest legal run-in, too: It believes it has resolved lingering issues enough to move forward with its long-anticipated I.P.O.

FINRA hit Robinhood with a $70 million fine, the regulator‚Äôs largest ever, for a host of sins, including giving customers wrong information about trading on margin, failing to properly determine whether customers should have been approved to trade options and not properly shoring up its technical systems to avoid a series of outages between 2018 and 2020 that led to losses for customers.

That‚Äôs on top of previous fines, including a $65 million one by the S.E.C. in December for misleading customers.

And the hits may keep on coming. Lawmakers, who pummeled Robinhood‚Äôs C.E.O., Vlad Tenev, during a hearing in February, want tougher penalties: ‚ÄúRobinhood won‚Äôt clean up its act with slap-on-the-wrist settlements,‚Äù Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted. ‚ÄúOur regulators need to show some backbone to hold Robinhood accountable.‚Äù The company still faces several pending suits and investigations:

Massachusetts‚Äô top securities regulator sued Robinhood earlier this year, seeking to bar the company from operating in the state because of its aggressive marketing tactics.

The S.E.C. is still reviewing the company‚Äôs role in the January meme-stock rally.

Robinhood is a defendant in dozens of potential class action lawsuits from retail traders arising from trading restrictions during the meme-stock frenzy. The cases were consolidated into a single case in South Florida and divided into four parts, including ‚Äúthe Robinhood tranche.‚Äù Next month, the plaintiffs must file a single combined complaint for each of the four claims ‚Äî and it could drag on for a long time.

But the, uh, good news for Robinhood is that it‚Äôs moving ahead with its I.P.O., with the brokerage set to publish its prospectus imminently, DealBook‚Äôs Michael de la Merced and Erin Griffith report for The Times. Settling the FINRA investigations appears to have been the final legal hurdle that the company wanted to clear before ‚Äúflipping‚Äù its hitherto confidential I.P.O. document. (Keep your eyes peeled for the rundown of the company‚Äôs legal issues in the document, which could run to novella length.) If all goes to plan, expect Robinhood‚Äôs own shares to begin trading before the August doldrums."

Brands like corsair and asus certainly charge a premium, but also make high quality, very good looking products.

Peripherals

Prebuilt and Laptops

* ASUUY (ROG, TUF)*
* LNVGY (Legion)*
* DELL (Alienware)
* HPQ (Omen)

I was also thinking about retailers (BBY, NEGG), but I'm not sure I want brick and mortar exposure, at least not with this.
Dividend yield is also pretty negligible thanks to most of the companies not paying at all, or paying very little *ahem* NVIDIA.

2021-07-01 00:00:00,stocks,"DD: $WHR Whirlpool, a well Internationally-Diversified Appliance Stock Background: I originally came across this stock studying it during a project for an International Business class, and learned about how Internationally Dominant the appliance brand is. 

Markets:

[https://www.whirlpoolcorp.com/global-locations/](https://www.whirlpoolcorp.com/global-locations/) 

HQ'd in Benton Harbor Michigan, North America: has 14 Headquarters for manufacturing/distribution in North America in US, Canada, Mexico. 

Europe, Middle East, Africa: 6 plants in Italy, 3 in Poland, 4 elsewhere in the region

Latin America: 1 plant in Guatemala, 11 in South America

Asia: 4 plants in India, 4 in China, 1 in Singapore 1 AUS plant

Whirlpool is one of the most internationally dominant companies I've ever researched. It's no wonder it came up in a case study of my international business class, and as a IB major, I believe that companies like these have a huge advantage. With massive supply chains, and integration into multiple markets, stocks like these are both flexible and capable of huge earnings growth, as their dominance in larger foreign markets allows them to slowly integrate into more specialized markets.

Their PE ratio reflects this as it is trading just over a ratio of 10, but earning around 17 in it's 5 year average. A ratio of 10 is generally reasonable regardless of industry, and it's also ahead of it's dividend yield average, currently yielding at 2.57% 

With this international diversity, risk of political barriers to earnings are lower when so much of its sales are driven by foreign markets. 

Their balance sheet is also balanced with the company having a current ratio of about 1, but no huge concerns with long term debt. The company is neither under nor overleveraged in my opinion, and still has time to take advantage of cheap fed interest rates in the US

If you want a stock whose earnings is less affected by US markets, consider adding WHR to your portfolio."

There have been situations when I‚Äôve been invested in a stock and have watched the bid/ask price closely only to be confounded by the ask price‚Äôs actions. There will be situations when the ask price will refuse to budge over the last price sale. Sometimes even staying below the last sale for quite some time.

In the situations in which the ask price stays at the last sale price, it will just stay there even while quite a few sales at that price are being done, until eventually of course when a last sale price is lower and closer to the bid price, at which time the ask price just simply drops.

I understand the ask/bid price is based off supply and demand, but logic says when demand is there at that current price, ask for a little more, I just don‚Äôt get it!!  This has happened to me on stocks that were allegedly being heavily shorted, but I wasn't sure if that would play into it.

2021-07-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Connecting the Dots: My High-Conviction Bet on Paysafe (PSFE) It was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F‚Äôs showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.

That‚Äôs all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long-term.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER‚Äôs come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it‚Äôs no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.

The comprehensive DD below is for investors with a longer view who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you‚Äôre not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer called Paysafe, ‚Äúthe ultimate stock for this moment‚Äù and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to ‚Äú$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.‚Äù  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.

But informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo‚Äôs several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it‚Äôs worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)

With a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they‚Äôve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:

&#x200B;

* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is ‚Äúupwards of 7-10 years‚Äù ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, ‚ÄúThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents‚Äô age,‚Äù adding that the private equity firms ‚Äúhave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.‚Äù ^(5)
* Under Blackstone/CVC‚Äôs stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the ‚Äúmid to high teens.‚Äù  But even if you include 2020‚Äôs stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal‚Äôs current projected growth. ^(6,7)
* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.
* Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe‚Äôs strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that‚Äôs and ‚Äúm‚Äù and a ‚Äúb‚Äù.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That‚Äôs a 36x return.  He says  ‚ÄúThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.‚Äù ^(6,9)

**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**

* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe‚Äôs already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don‚Äôt include growth from their ""active M&A pipeline"" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).
* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: ‚ÄúResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.""
* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.
* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody‚Äôs credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: ‚ÄúOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe‚Äôs leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.‚Äù  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.
* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.
* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.

**Highly competitve**

* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion ‚Äúunbanked‚Äù globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just yesterday, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.
* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar‚Äôs, and Pointsbet among many others.
* \#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe‚Äôs proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted ‚ÄúBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution‚Äù, ‚ÄúPayment Processor of the Year,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest Payment Method.‚Äù
* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted ‚ÄúBest Digital Wallet‚Äù for ‚Äúbest consumer take up‚Äù, ‚Äúmost innovative technology‚Äù with ‚Äúgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.‚Äù
* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn‚Äôt meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe‚Äôs digital wallet Skrill as ‚Äúgreat‚Äù (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)
   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as ‚ÄúAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as ‚Äúbad‚Äù (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as ‚Äúbad‚Äù (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)

**‚ÄúAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.""** \- Bill Foley

&#x200B;

* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe‚Äôs advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don‚Äôt realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.
* Bill Foley says, ""It‚Äôs going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else‚Ä¶we‚Äôre seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that‚Äôs headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We‚Äôve got a wide landscape we can attack. It‚Äôs pretty exciting‚Äù
* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, ‚ÄúWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.‚Äù
* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, ‚ÄúPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,‚Äù adding, ‚Äúwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.‚Äù ^(13)
   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:
      * ""New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering""

&#x200B;

* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a ""Buy"". A few quotes :
   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: ‚ÄúWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized & complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.‚Äù ‚Äúrecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE‚Äôs business and the FTAC II transaction‚Äù and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: ‚ÄúPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online & in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet & eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it‚Äôs this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.‚Äù ^(14)
   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: ‚ÄúPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE‚Äôs revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.‚Äù iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow ‚Äúat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world‚Äù with a ""5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%."" ^(15)
   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its ‚Äúrobust risk management operation,‚Äù and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)

**MOAT:**  **‚Äúrobust risk management operation‚Äù**

So why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?

Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : ‚ÄúWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it‚Äôs hard to copy.‚Ä¶We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It‚Äôs a real strength of ours. We‚Äôve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we‚Äôve upgraded the team, we‚Äôve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players‚Ä¶we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can‚Äôt do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we‚Äôre not only talking about take rates and comps, we‚Äôre talking about revenue-generation, we‚Äôre talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That‚Äôs a really, really powerful position to have.‚Äù ^(9)

&#x200B;

**Valuation:**

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.

* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),
* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.
* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.
* The group's collective growth rate of \~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their ""active M&A pipeline.""  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.
* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:

Paysafe‚Äôs share price with average of sector peer multiples:

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09
* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91
* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

More realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100

* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**
* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**
* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**

**Average : $46.52**

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe‚Äôs conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for ""$45/55"" may actually be quite reasonable.

2021-07-01 16:47:20,stocks,"Good points. Not sure if you read the post but I'll respond to each point.

* The large float definitely makes it hard to move the stock but it also makes it attractive to institutions seeking larger investment vehicles for their capital.  The problem is that they'll keep the price down for as long as they need to load which is typically a slow process.
* So far stagnant growth has only been last year, affected by Covid and exiting high-risk revenue channels in Asia.  28% CAGR prior to that. 18% CAGR inclusive of that which is on par with PayPal's projections.
* They do very well against competitors in their niche verticals because they can mitigate risk and handle diverse regulatory requirements better than most. See section on MOAT
* Sportsbetting/iGaming is expected to be their strongest growth segment going forward and this is where they are currently dominant globally with first mover advantage in just about every country."

I expect they'll want commons to get well above $19 or $20 before they call in warrants.  I'm hoping they don't call them in until common are in the $30's at least.  There are many insiders holding warrants so it is in there interests as well."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Understanding Enterprise Value Almost everyone considers P:E when buying stock in a company, but have you considered their [EV/EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072715/what-considered-healthy-evebitda.asp)? One is not necessarily better than the other, but It can be very helpful to consider a companies Enterprise Value.

Say you were considering buying 2 cars, and they both cost $30k. But one has $2000 cash in the glove compartment, and the other had $2000 in unpaid parking tickets in the glove. That would be important information to you, right? If you only look at market cap and not Enterprise Value (EV), you are ignoring what's in the glove compartment.

Consider 2 companies with a similar market cap, say INTC ($226.7B) and CSCO ($223.4B). If you just look at their market caps, you might say they are close enough (1.5% difference) that you will just directly compare their income statements. But Cisco has $29.4B in cash and only $14.5B in debt, so when you buy their stock, you are also buying some of their cash reserves. This is included in the Enterprise Value (EV) which is $223.4B+$14.5B-$29.4B=$208.5B

Intel has $23.9B cash and $36B debt, so their EV is $226.7B+$36B-$23.9B=$238.8B

So when you consider their cash and debt, Intel can be considered 14.5% more expensive than Cisco instead of 1.5%.

It's not always the be all end all, but it can be very helpful to look at Enterprise Value when you are comparing stocks."
2021-07-01 13:04:52,stocks,"I almost use Enterprise Value to EBITDA but it dpeens on teh type of company. For ex, there's no point in using EV to EBITDA for a bank. They are tradionally priced on earnings and book value, plus now revenues a little.  But for asset heavy companies or industries that take on a lot of debt sometimes you want to look at the company independent of the effects of financing considerations and how they depreciate their assets."

2021-07-01 13:23:19,stocks,"For younger tech companies, I quite like EV/GP since they reinvest a lot of profits into R&D so looking at EBITDA is kinda meaningless"
2021-07-01 09:53:47,stocks,"As an investor it's certainly an additional tool,  as long as you look hard at the depreciation value which companies generally don't value correctly. If a ceo or cfo focuses on it,  stay clear"
2021-07-01 10:04:44,stocks,"You should be looking at these numbers for every company, not just the ones who tell you emphasize them. EBITDA is flawed, but it is a decent measure of how much cash business operations are bringing in. That's a helpful number as long as you are aware of what is being excluded from it."
2021-07-01 14:00:50,stocks,"what's GP? gross profits?  R&D you might be better off just looking as a percent of sales... technically, a market approach is gonna undervalue a company like a tech company with high early stage intellectual property.  They are just plain difficult to value i have to admit..."
2021-07-01 10:20:22,stocks,"Depreciation is not included in Enterprise Value or EBITDA.

Depreciation is subtracted from EBIT so that number can be fudged. It is added back into EBITDA so it is not a part of the number.

EV is just market cap - cash + debt. Non-cash assets that would depreciate are not included."
2021-07-01 13:23:50,stocks,"all i care about is earnings

EAITDA"
2021-07-01 14:28:01,stocks,"Definitely an important number. I would say that EBITDA can give you a better look at how the business is performing compared to its peers, since it shows how much money they make purely from business operations.

But higher net earnings are really the end goal so I see where you're coming from."

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know when meme stocks such as this will crash, but we probably do not have to wait too long, as I believe the retail crowd is fully invested in this theme, and Wall Street has jumped on the coattails,‚Äù Burry told Barron‚Äôs via email. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of new money available to jump on the bandwagon.‚Äù
 
I know meme stock investors love to quote Burry, so I‚Äôm curious to see their thoughts now that he has turned on them."
2021-07-01 12:23:09,stocks,It‚Äôs really no secret that meme stocks can crash at really any given moment‚Ä¶. Mostly everyone that‚Äôs invested knows the risks.
2021-07-01 09:38:29,stocks,"He went from saying entire market crash to going for meme stocks crash. Which any average person can say and has been for weeks about stuff like AMC,GME, etc. Seems like he wants to be proven right with meme stock crash to then use that for his full market crash fear mongering."
2021-07-01 09:48:58,stocks,"This guy analyzed Burry's track record and says it hasn't been very reliable. Not sure how this applies to meme predictions though.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oawsxf/i\_analyzed\_last\_15\_years\_of\_news\_articles\_to\_see/"
2021-07-01 09:59:13,stocks,Michael Burry has been wrong a lot more than he has been right. He predicted WW3 and a global collapse years ago and none of it happened.
2021-07-01 09:52:43,stocks,"Maybe.

But he also says index funds are a bubble and are just like CDOs. To an extent, he's right that they're essentially CDOs, but how many millions of people and trillions of dollars rely on index funds for investing and retirement? That would require almost everyone to stop investing in them or even pull money from them and buy equities directly. I don't ever think that will happen.

Dude has lost a lot of money in shorting and bubble fear. That's why he buys barron land for water rights (or some bullshit) that no one cares about. He got it right once and now everyone gives him too much attention."
2021-07-01 09:37:52,stocks,Burry lost against SPY in the span of 15 years. Good luck following some clown noone cares bout.

++++GameStop Releases First Quarter 2021 Financial Results +++ 06/09/21
Net Sales Grew 25% to $1.3 Billion Appoints Technology Veterans Matt Furlong and Mike Recupero to CEO and CFO Positions, Respectively GRAPEVINE, Texas, June 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME ), today reported results for the first quarter ended May 1, 2021

GameStop is the epitome of value investing: Gaming revenue beat sports and movies combined in 2020 and expected to grow from 150B to 300B in the coming years. 

-0$ in debt 

-Raised 1.1 billion dollars from selling 5M shares (225$ average price)

-Added to the Russel 1000

-Top Growing stock in the last 52 weeks (up 4,900%) no stock comes even close to competing. 

-Ryan Cohen (ex Chewy Founder) was just elected Chairman of the board. 

-GameStop just elected a new CEO coming straight from Amazon. 

-Many executives on the board come from Chewy and Amazon. 

-GameStop Announces Multi-year Strategic Partnership with Microsoft (GameStop will also upgrade its e-commerce site as part of the partnership.)

-Recently entered the NFT space. 

-Worldwide media attention and known brand even overseas. 

-Heavily shorted: Melvin Capitol and Citadel both have open puts on the stock. Short squeeze is a very real topic for discussion. 

-Huge Institutional Ownership: 39,671,973 - 56.73% owned by institutional entities. BlackRock owns the most shares in GameStop (9,217,335 shares)
and hasn‚Äôt closed their position, they are holding and are up over 900% on their positions. They provide stability to the market, hence not dropping below 100$ and 200$ easily. (BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, with over $8 trillion in assets under management as of January 2021. BlackRock operates globally with 70 offices in 30 countries and clients in 100 countries)

-Full integrated social media presence. 

-Millions of power up rewards members and enormous fan base. 

-The only brick and mortar retail company dedicated exclusively to gaming. 

-Focus on customer services and providing excellent products and service. 

-Gaming consoles and now PC consoles make up a large portion of GameStops income.

Being debt free is unusual for brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Walmart Inc. and Best Buy Co., which have billions in long-term obligations. Some stores hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic actually borrowed additional funds last year to survive. GameStop finished its last fiscal year with $755.3 million in lease obligations, according to the company‚Äôs annual report."
2021-07-01 09:59:11,stocks,A broken clock is right twice a day
2021-07-01 09:39:05,stocks,"Apart from the original $WHACKD.
When those at risk of exposure start buying to burn it then the price will go up exponentially like nothing we have seen before."
2021-07-01 11:04:25,stocks,It will fluctuate
2021-07-01 09:50:31,stocks,"I think it would be different if burry said it by tweet. But since yahoo finance has been telling me to forget amc and forget Gamestop since January, and has not stopped telling me to forget Gamestop, I think they have a narrative that this fits into. And I wouldn't be surprised if the quote bury gave was reworded before being published. If you truly believe yahoo is right, then take a short position on meme stocks, I dare ya."
2021-07-01 09:49:57,stocks,ü§° = Burry
2021-07-01 16:29:51,stocks,The point is that it's not investing; it was pure speculation.
2021-07-01 18:32:14,stocks,"Or maybe he's saying the overall market will crash and that the meme stocks would be the most exposed because of how volatile it is? I mean, you're trying to draw reference to something that has no secondary meaning."
2021-07-01 09:50:58,stocks,It‚Äôll be just funny to see the meme crowd act like he‚Äôs a clown now when they‚Äôve been worshiping him for the past 2 months.
2021-07-01 11:59:03,stocks,A global collapse did happen........ but just for a few days. Then the governments decided to fuck over everyone else to save our portfolios.
2021-07-01 11:57:08,stocks,I doubt he lost a lot of money. He took a shitliad of bullish position in march 2020 then shifted to shorting tesla in 900$ and the coin when it was around 60k. Say what you want about the guy but he sure as hell isn't losing a lot of money.
2021-07-01 09:42:09,stocks,Kind of what I expected to here. Meme stock investors were quoting him like no other but as soon as he says something like this he knows nothing.
2021-07-01 12:03:06,stocks,"Gaming performing better than movies and sports is not why GME is up over 5,000%.

Also, with everything reopening, look for people‚Äôs entertainment dollars rotating back into live entertainment and other non-‚Äúsitting at home‚Äù activities. 

Sorry for not drinking the Koolaid, but GME is much more likely to go down than up in the next several months. At best, it‚Äôll trade sideways."
2021-07-01 10:58:14,stocks,"Gaming revenues were indeed great in 2020. What you fail to mention is that Gamestop's revenues have been on a decline every year since 2017. 2020 should have been their year but their sales were even lower than 2019! That alone should say a lot about how badly the company was managed. Let's see if the new management can turn it around, but saying that GME isn't a meme stock is pure bullshit"
2021-07-01 10:46:24,stocks,Movies and sports took a big dive and gaming an increase because of the pandemic. These conditions are once in a lifetime and says absolutely nothing about the future of GME.
2021-07-01 12:37:00,stocks,Lmao stop it. Even if GME continues to impress it's the king of meme stock. There's literally a feverish movement of you guys spilling into every corner of Reddit don't act like it's not a meme stock.
2021-07-01 09:41:29,stocks,It takes some massive cognitive dissonance to act like he‚Äôs not referring to GME. Even if you believe it‚Äôs a good investment.
2021-07-01 09:51:59,stocks,"Telling someone they have to short a stock if they think it‚Äôs overvalued is such a lazy thing to do and just signifies you have no response. 
 
You have to be insane to think he didn‚Äôt actually say this and the media is just making it up."
2021-07-01 12:41:50,stocks,"So funny seeing the ""then short it!"" Comment everywhere these days. Like you all had a powow and agreed it was the ultimate comeback.

If you're so convinced you own the float, why are so many of you trying to convince doubters to short?"
2021-07-01 16:40:54,stocks,"Exactly, if you made a significant gain in a short period on a stock like AMC just get out now, you‚Äôve already won."
2021-07-01 11:00:21,stocks,The meme stock pumpers will have to change their narrative once again and make him out to be a shill / villain / lizard person.
2021-07-01 11:57:15,stocks,Maybe it‚Äôs different people saying those things.
2021-07-01 15:39:01,stocks,They‚Äôre gambling and emotionally invested so it makes sense. Nothing illogical about what he‚Äôs saying and has said
2021-07-01 11:15:05,stocks,"You‚Äôre speaking of the retail stores revenue not their e commerce which is up way more than 400% YOY. Should we compare gaming to its brick and mortar or it‚Äôs online sales? If you exclude e commerce sales then‚Ä¶ umm what are you doing? They have a deal with Microsoft since 2020 to reinvent themselves into e-commerce. GameStop is the epitome of value investing, due to gaming revenue crushing movies and sports combined. ThTs UfC too."
2021-07-01 17:16:55,stocks,Anything worth swing  or day trading is a meme or pump n dump.theres trading and investing.dont know why ppl get so pissed about meme stocks it's a way to make money just like options.instead of the long term 10% a year investing.nothing wrong with that if your happy making less or need a safe bet for retirement.
2021-07-01 19:03:54,stocks,"GameStop has revealed a few things: It is executing ‚Äústrategic de-densification efforts‚Äù (i.e. closing 12% of brick-and-mortar stores this quarter), according to the company‚Äôs earnings report, and opening a new fulfillment center in Pennsylvania to ship out its products. The two new executives from Amazon (as well as newly elected chairman and former Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen) should better understand e-commerce, but calling this a ‚Äúdigital transformation‚Äù‚Äîas GameStop has repeatedly done‚Äîmight overstate the effort. Closing stores and improving shipping can only get the company so far as an e-commerce strategy."
2021-07-01 19:40:03,stocks,"It‚Äôs what you say it is, but memes don‚Äôt hire CEOs from Amazon.. you are a meme"
2021-07-01 10:13:02,stocks,"The man has autism, doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt know his world. This is the world of deep value stocks, time will show that gaming revenue will grow by 400% in the next few years. Most people are speculating on stocks that are not independently influenced by the pandemic and it‚Äôs many variants. And Tesla thrives during a pandemic, because their company is based around renewable energy and the future of transport. Tesla is a trillion dollar company. Many missed it, I hope you don‚Äôt miss both of these."
2021-07-01 10:28:11,stocks,"It‚Äôs the top performing stock in the last year, by a long shot, up 5,250%! It‚Äôs a good investment because it‚Äôs #1 and not affected negatively by the pandemic."
2021-07-01 11:50:59,stocks,"he didnt say they made it up, he said they might of reworded it. That shit happens all the time."
2021-07-01 11:48:55,stocks,"Do you think that's what he said word for word? A man that speaks in riddles, just goes ahead and says meme stocks are gone crash?. Ok man, you believe what you want to believe. I'm gonna go ahead and believe that nothing we hear from msm is 100% accurate."
2021-07-01 13:38:46,stocks,"I'm not trying to convince anytime to do anything. If you believe you're right, make a move on it.

Inaction doesn't do anything."
2021-07-01 12:10:47,stocks,Different people say and think differently? Get the fuck outta here
2021-07-01 11:52:04,stocks,"Assuming everything you‚Äôre saying regarding the e-commerce pivot comes true, wouldn‚Äôt this make GME a growth stock, not a value stock? It‚Äôs not a a store of wealth holding intrinsic value, it‚Äôs pivoting into a new space hoping for large growth that hasn‚Äôt yet materialized but bulls believe will. The bet is on its growth. Something huge and established would be a value stock, like Walmart or something."
2021-07-01 17:34:06,stocks,"Listen in very simple terms, while most publicly traded gaming companies had growth in 2020 vs 2019, Gamestop did not. Whether online or through their stores, they did not catch the wave that should have made them increase their sales. That's a very basic bear case, using Gamestop's old model of business of course though. That's why I'm saying perhaps bew management can turn things around, but if you look at Gamestop's annual earning reports over the past 5 years, it isn't a pretty picture"
2021-07-01 12:09:04,stocks,"Remindme! 3 years

Tesla is not a trillion dollar company. Your connection from them thriving during the pandemic because they use renewable energy makes no sense. And anyways,  pandemic is over. 

If gme revenue grows by 400% in the next couple years, they will generate 20 billion in revenue.They also have about 2 billion in assets and 1 billion in liablities (they do have debt idk why people say they dont). Needing to grow 400% to have revenue of of current market cap, and having a low book value is not a great spot. Gme as more than a squeeze play is really iffy."
2021-07-01 10:23:38,stocks,Not sure what his autism has to do with anything.
2021-07-01 12:00:52,stocks,"It was a good investment BEFORE it went up 5,250%. Once something over-inflates, it is no longer a good investment. 

It is priced as though the company has already successfully pivoted to a new business model with strong earnings (neither of which is true)."
2021-07-01 12:04:16,stocks,It‚Äôs a direct quote from an email he sent. Lol
2021-07-01 13:46:29,stocks,"Who says avoiding GME is inaction? I'm still researching and investing the same money every month. It's well known that you can be right about a price movement but wrong about the time frame and still lose out.

I'm not even saying you're wrong. Personally, it's all too much for my risk tolerance and I accept that I've missed out on massive gains that some have made. I just think ""why don't you short it then"" is a lame comeback and I've seen it all over Reddit, so it's clearly the new thing to say."
2021-07-01 19:01:47,stocks,"Fortunately, GameStop isn‚Äôt locked into many long-term leases. The majority of them expire within the next two years, giving the company flexibility to walk away from poor-performing locations.

Still, GameStop can‚Äôt shrink its way into prosperity. The hope is to actually sell a bigger range of products, but do more of it online, while efficiently using the stores that remain. Memes don‚Äôt hire Amazon executives, the meme must be you."
2021-07-01 12:12:09,stocks,"Physical stores aren‚Äôt liabilities, they are closing them anyway. I use them all the time to get what I need. You seem fixated on the past and not the partnership with Microsoft which is a trillion dollar company. Toyota now have a partnership with Tesla."

2021-07-01 12:33:45,stocks,Also even successfully turning the company around and becoming profitable isn't a guarantee that it can ever reach the value it's currently priced at.

2021-07-01 12:20:37,stocks,"Physical stores are assets not liabilities lol. Gme has 627 million of long term debt and 1.3 billion in current liabilities. That you think stores they own is part of that total is really concerning. Have you looked at their balance sheet?

Their partnership with Microsoft is them using a shit ton of Microsoft products and services. This may help the business, but its not like Microsoft is invested in GME lol. I read the press release and its basically gme saying they bought a bunch of Microsoft stuff. You know who else does that, every company on earth.

Edit - just realized first you called stores liabilities cause you go in there all the time, but then you said they were closing them all anyways. Which is it Regardless? Regardless of ur mistake about calling them ""liabilities"" this is another nonsensical point."
2021-07-01 13:41:20,stocks,Not sure what the point is of that copy/paste comment.  Just because it doesn‚Äôt have long term debt doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a good investment.
2021-07-01 13:08:04,stocks,"You‚Äôre wrong, they recently paid of all debts on hand. Not sure where you are getting your information from, you‚Äôre definitely not up to date, you didn‚Äôt even know they had a partnership with Microsoft. Damn.

2021-07-01 14:00:32,stocks,It means you‚Äôre wrong and you don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre talking about. Now comes another excuse of why you missed out on the dips
2021-07-01 13:33:59,stocks,"Bro, you literally called stores liabilities. Thats a debt.

I said you were wrong, stores are an asset. These are not opinions, these are textbook terms.

Go to fuckin yahoo finance and look at their balance sheet, and tell me if the 216 million they paid off covers ALL of their liabilities

Please explain what the Microsoft partnership accomplishes. What do you think it does?"
2021-07-01 14:02:50,stocks,"I didn‚Äôt miss out on anything. I‚Äôve been making steady returns the last few weeks on call credit spreads. I have no interest in going long or short.

2021-07-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Are we due a market correction? We‚Äôve had unprecedented amounts of QE to stimulate the U.S and other economies, inflation is here and likely to continue/grow for some time. The last period where central banks pursued similar policy was after the 08 crash, if you look at the charts from this period the recovery was a bumpy road around a year after the we reached bottom there were fairly significant market corrections in most the U.S markets (Nasdaq, SP500 etc) of around 10% or over, and a similar trend a year after again! We‚Äôve had an unusually long bull run how much longer can this go on? Markets are at an all time high but the economy hasn‚Äôt even recovered yet. Long term macro we will of course see growth but at some point before the end of the year there will be a correction, what are your views on this?"

But now I feel I would like to invest my money in some company/ETFs that I can really set and forget and maybe put money into some riskier growth areas.

At the moment I have money in Apple, AMD, Microsoft be it very small positions.

Then I have some money in riskier stocks but ones I believe will be go up over the next few years and these are companies I do believe in. I canrlt name them or my post gets deleted.

I can afford to add a few hundred ¬£ each month but want that money to now go into less speculative stocks.

I've been reading on here and have heard people mention stocks like MU, AMAT and TSM.

Overtime, you will gain more confidence and ability to identify individual companies, and I prefer them over ETF's since ETF's imo are the epitome of 'diworseification' the idea that too many random companies will result in an average return.

The Shanghai-headquartered EV maker delivered 8,083 vehicles in June, up about 116% when compared with year-ago numbers, and also reported a 20.4% jump from May, when sales were hurt due to the volatile chip supplies.

This is the highest number of monthly deliveries posted by Nio ever.

2021-07-01 14:06:34,stocks,"That's a flawed comparison though. You can't just compare units for units. If NIO were geared up to sell 5 million cars a year by 2030 but at much higher margins than Honda, it would make sense that people had started taking their money out of Honda and into NIO.

That said, that's clearly not the case here. NIO very well may sell 5 million cars a year by 2030, but I've seen nobody explain why they would be able to sell them at higher margins. Therefore, at best it would make sense for NIO to also be valued at 55 billion, minus 10-20 billion for the uncertainty of them having to prove that they can actually sell 5 million cars a year."

They are legitimate competition and their shares haven‚Äôt even split, whereas companies like Ford that have been around forever have. $60 is going to be nothing in 10 years after the shares have split once or twice and the company is giving the EV market a run for their money since they are some of the first and only legitimate competition. That‚Äôs my opinion anyway"
2021-07-01 10:56:33,stocks,"Shares splitting does nothing. All that matters is market cap, and what percent of that you're buying.

I very well would like the bull case for NIO to be true because I DO want to invest in them. Like I said, they seem like a great company long term. Just not at this valuation, unless someone can explain me what I'm missing.

Also, wtf do the stock price and stock splits have to do with anything? They're literally irrelevant for valuations and say nothing about a company. You think they're going from $90B market cap to a few hundred because ""$60 dollars isn't a high stock price?"" If that is your argumentation you really shouldn't be investing."
2021-07-01 12:26:58,stocks,I agree. But shares splitting is representative of all those things. It‚Äôs a quick way to point out how far along Ford is and that each of their $60 shares aren‚Äôt equivalent.

2021-07-01 14:18:08,stocks,"I'm the one getting heated? :'D

Again, I DO think NIO is worth my time. I'm just trying to figure out why people think it's worth $90 billion. To make sure there's nothing I'm missing.

So far all you've given back to me is ""I bought low"", ""I think the share price will increase"" and ""the company will do well in the future"". What are the fundamentals why you think this company is worth well over $50B (which is roughly where you bought in at)? 

> I'm doing really well with it and have high hopes for the future.

Hope isn't a strategy, and putting money into a stock based on hope doesn't make you an investor, it makes you a gambler. I just want to know why you think their profit margins and earnings will be high enough to justify a significantly higher valuation than $90B."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Let's talk Oil I've been following SG ETC WTI +2x Daily Leveraged Collateralized (OIL2L.MI) for quite some time now, and I have noticed an interesting prospect. 

&#x200B;

The stock was created in 2017 and was priced at 47 Euros, which was the price of Oil at the time. 

During 2020 it was grouped at 1 to 100 when it was worth a fraction of the price due to the price of oil tanking over the pandemic. 

If the value of the stock is actually tied to the value of oil, today the stock should be worth 7800 euro, whereas the stock is trading at around 380. 

Would it be a good idea to invest, given the price is so much lower than its actual value?"
2021-07-01 05:47:04,stocks,"Ignore past performance, it‚Äôs irrelevant. It‚Äôs a leveraged fund. It is future WTI development that is meaningful to this stock performance.

The only reason to invest now in the fund is if you think WTI oil will continue to increase. If it does, you can expect that for around every 1% increase in WTI, this fund will grow by 2%. However, it‚Äôs also not usually recommended to hold leveraged funds for long periods due to time decay."
2021-07-01 07:59:30,stocks,Use a starting point of June 2020. When the oil prices had the big fluctuations early 2020 it crashed many of the ETFs/ ETCs. They didn't have the proper safety hedging in place. Most should have fixed that problem now.

2021-07-01 07:40:09,stocks,What? It's up like 15% in the past week or so. The time to buy was when it was dicking around in the 70s.
2021-07-01 08:34:56,stocks,"always time imo at least now, ive bought at the ath probably 5 or 6 times and my average share price is in the 60s.

 it's a great company, comparable companies stocks are in the 150 range if not even higher, so I don't see any reason why it wont get there.

sometimes it has dips or gets stagnant for a while so if you're really concerned you can try to time it but I didn't buy more at $80 because I thought it would drop back down to the mid 70s and now it's at $94"
2021-07-01 07:32:47,stocks,Now is the time to buy.

I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice."
2021-07-01 08:48:51,stocks,Also watching with a measly few shares bought last year. I guess the only conclusion is to buy more and average up as it doesn't seem to stop.
2021-07-01 08:57:35,stocks,I sure damn hope so
2021-07-01 09:29:16,stocks,Wouldn't be surprised to see their stock rise on this news.  Likely need to close 25%+ more of their global retail locations and shed or consolidate some of their other brands.
2021-07-01 10:35:01,stocks,"The excuse the press always claim is that they did not exceed earnings enough.

2021-07-01 13:44:26,stocks,"Dogs only, but BARK is a much better value than CHWY with much more room to run. BarkBox has higher margins due to vertical integration of their products. Plus it's a potential acquisition target (= payday for shareholders).

It's around $10.50 right now and Citi initiated it at BUY - PT $16 this past Monday.

For an intro, check out the transcript of their May earnings call on their IR page.

I have a very large position."

2021-07-01 14:20:32,stocks,"Tbh that‚Äôs probably why it‚Äôs going up. They were able to settle, the lawsuit is done, and I wouldn‚Äôt be suprised if it‚Äôs one of those situations were the settlement was smaller than investors expected (haven‚Äôt been paying attention to this or invested though). Regardless, they weren‚Äôt held liable for any wrong doing and it‚Äôs over with, time to move on. At least that might be the investor mindset."

2021-07-01 09:33:43,stocks,Yep
2021-07-01 10:34:35,stocks,I would stay away. The auto industry is incredibly cyclical. I just dont think its worth the risk
2021-07-01 10:55:16,stocks,"If you‚Äôre going to invest in anything in the auto industry, I would go with CAR"
2021-07-01 12:02:28,stocks,"Yeah, I usually stick with industries I know and do more research but bought in on CarMax as kind of an impulsive fluke‚Ä¶ Thankfully, I bought in low but, man, I am never doing that again!"
2021-07-01 11:37:52,stocks,"Literally half my portfolio. If the goal is to purely make money, there's not much reason to hold anything else if you can stomach the high volatility. I still want to hold other stocks for fun though."
2021-07-01 12:18:04,stocks,"If we‚Äôre going long on QQQ, is there any reason not to get TQQQ if we don‚Äôt need the money soon? Losses are still capped, correct?"
2021-07-01 12:49:20,stocks,"Only time will tell. Oil is still dominant in a lot of older investors minds as having staying power. A lot of money might be flooding that sector now, but it depends on your investing timetable if it‚Äôs worth it for you. 

For some it‚Äôs a better long term investment to buy stocks in the clean energy sector they know they are going to hold for 20-30 years. I think a lot of the investors will shift out of oil and into clean energy in the next 10-20 years as oil loses more and more of the energy sector."
2021-07-01 12:42:46,stocks,"While I don't hate Cathie, that's definitely one that she got wrong.

She said ""she'd be surprised if she ever saw oil above $70 again"" and I randomly guessed that it'd be at $80 in the summer earlier in the year.

Having said that, there are too many people that are looking for $100 oil, so that is probably not going to happen, a lot like how TNX to 2% probably ends up not happening (at least in 2021, that is on this front)."
2021-07-01 13:34:28,stocks,Is that the warning flag for a correction?
2021-07-01 16:23:51,stocks,"if you own options they split with a stock, so if you have a $10 call on a $10 stock and it splits by 10 to $1, you now have $1 call"
2021-07-01 14:21:24,stocks,Swing trade or long term hold if you're not averse to investing in relatively early growth and you believe in their tech (because that's what you're paying for)
2021-07-01 15:07:37,stocks,Very long term hold
2021-07-01 16:43:48,stocks,"i dunno, bought calls. Plan on selling tomorrow no matter what, hoping for 4th of july gas surge and thats my exit."

2021-07-01 10:43:28,stocks,We are immune to emotion
2021-07-01 11:31:13,stocks,"Absolutely agree. 

Only thing that might put a hiccup in a gap up is if tech has another correction."
2021-07-01 12:58:37,stocks,"Fundstrat's Tom Lee said yesterday that he thinks AMZN could pop 20% before the end of the year.  

Long periods of consolidation on upward trending stocks almost always end with a large and abrupt movement upwards.  And considering what AMZN has done previously in these situations, coupled with its amazing earnings reports, theres no reason to think it wont do that."
2021-07-01 17:20:25,stocks,"1. Low volume is completely meaningless until it means something. I've seen crying about the volume for seemingly almost a year now. It's simply not meaningful at all though until a September 3rd, 2020 like day happens.

2. In the last 12 months, the S&P is 10 out of 12 on being green on jobs Friday. The first time where it was not happened during the fastest Nasdaq correction in history in September, and the second time was when Trump caught COVID.

There are a couple reasons why jobs Friday=higher could end up not playing out this time, but based off recent history, the lean should probably be toward it posting a 7th straight up day."
2021-07-01 17:21:00,stocks,"I am very bullish but stopped buying calls on Monday. Market has felt weird the past few days and I was surprised by the $2 increase today. Bought a few puts but should've stayed cash probably, I honestly have no idea"
2021-07-01 13:50:41,stocks,Why don't you make your own mind.
2021-07-01 13:11:28,stocks,"Needless to say, if there's a dip on jobs Friday tomorrow, it'll be the first one I can remember happening outside of when that Nasdaq correction started in September.

Like, I wouldn't completely rule it out (a major miss could cause concern about wage inflation and a blowout could cause concern about tapering), but if you go by what's been happening, there probably won't be.

Edit: Well, there was one in October but I believe that day had another issue."
2021-07-01 10:09:00,stocks,"That's biotech trading.  Company dumps everything in a failed product or something with no promise, announces they're shifting their efforts into something with promise, several large holders announce a price target reduction that is still higher than the current price, everyone throws a party and the stock rises.  

Personally do not think ALT is worth much more than the current entry price short term.  Long term it is a pure gamble on a successful Phase 1/2 or licensing deal."
2021-07-01 11:55:57,stocks,"Using margin isn't a bad thing unless you abuse it (like a credit card).

Fidelity only offers a Reg-T (2x leverage) so using 50% buying power is equivalent to an unleveraged cash account.

You will receive a margin call *only if the total holdings exceed 2x the account value*.  When this happens you can either (a) deposit money, (b) sell a long holding, or (c) close a short position.

However margin can become expensive if your *cash available goes below zero and you need to borrow cash*.  These short term loans are roughly $3 daily interest per $10k borrowed.  

Again this only applies to accounts with a negative cash balances."
2021-07-01 11:18:47,stocks,When you are putting in a trade there is an option to either select Cash or Margin.  The default is Margin.  Switch it to Cash.

2021-07-01 14:35:33,stocks,I think AMD would be a better buy rn. Because of their recent acquisition. Su is one of the best ceos of the past decade. And they have constantly been capturing market share from Intel. Just my opinion

2021-07-01 18:29:23,stocks,Yes. Their basic information page ok your broker‚Äôs site will show the annual cost.
2021-07-01 18:15:49,stocks,"there's a fee, but much lower than mutual funds"
2021-07-01 18:24:21,stocks,"Market often over reacts. And then corrects itself.

The big fish sell off on news like this just to buy in lower. If you sell or your stop loss gets triggered you lose. They often have insider info from the companies too about what they‚Äôre planning and what price they‚Äôre gonna do the offering at, because these are the people who are investors for the company."
2021-07-01 11:19:09,stocks,What you mean losses? Like first time red for the day? Or first time red in your overal account?
2021-07-01 13:14:23,stocks,Swallowing gets easier with practice
2021-07-01 11:35:57,stocks,"Sometimes it softens the blow when you remember they are not actually losses unless you sell.  If they are long term holds, do not focus on anything down on the day or since purchase.  If you are still confident in the investment, consider buying more shares to reduce your overall cost per share."

2021-07-01 12:49:28,stocks,"Because TQQQ drops 70% during a 30% correction in QQQ. A 70% drop requires a 333% rise to return to its original levels, while a 30% drop requires only a 43% rise. Do you see TQQQ recovering 333% at the speed that QQQ recovers 43%? No? That's why.

Leveraged funds are great during bull markets but terrible during bear markets. They *do not* recover your capital nearly as fast and in fact, a few of them are still recovering from the 2008 crash, a decade later."

Every time people tell you to sell you have an excuse. Now you say you cannot sell because everything else is ATH. I told you to sell a few months ago when everything was cheap but you had another silly excuse that you cannot sell cause you're under water.... sure.

You always fail to mention that it hit its ATH in July of last year.  Then dropped over 10%.  Then ATH again a few months later, then down 12%, then ATH again a few months later, then down 10% again.  I believe it has hit $3500-ish 5 times now in 12 months, and immediately sunk afterwards.  So gaining 6.2% when you were already down 10% isn‚Äôt impressive."
2021-07-01 11:02:08,stocks,Purely speculative.  There is no legitimate source to suggest that a split is coming.

You guys always pivot when discussing Amazon‚Äôs current performance.  What I do or don‚Äôt do with my money is a separate topic.  Let‚Äôs stick to Amazon‚Äôs performance in the last 11 months.  It‚Äôs flat and highly volatile (mostly to the downside).  No one said a year ago that it would be this flat.  Numbers didn‚Äôt suggest it either.  Every earnings report is amazing, yet it drops hard immediately after.  Same with Prime Day.  On at least three occasions in the last year, the general consensus was that you needed to load up on more Amazon, because the next big run was imminent.  So the numbers are amazing, the forecast is amazing, and the general consensus is that it‚Äôs amazing.  Yet the result is pathetic."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,stocks,What is your thought on PSFE and SOFI? What is a better investment option? What is your thought on these two companies? What is the better option in investing and what‚Äôs your justification? Both of these companies are in financial sector with a promising outlook but which one stands out better?
2021-07-01 08:18:10,stocks,I own both but I have 10X the amount of SoFi vs PSFE.  SoFi has a way larger target market and has had positive EBITDA for the past 3 quarters in a row.  SoFi also has Galileo that gives them a strong B2B play as well that already has 70M accounts.
2021-07-01 12:09:48,stocks,"SOFI is down near the lower 2x stddev 20 day Bollinger band, so if you're investing short-term, it looks like a great buy."
2021-07-01 14:35:28,stocks,"SOFI was one of the rare SPACS that increased its value after the merger. The recent hype started after panic selling on PIPE lockup news dropped the price below $20, which is the same entry point I had been waiting on for a while. I'm guessing other people were waiting too since the price held firm despite heavy selling pressure.

PSFE has been the opposite. People forget PSFE was hyped hard after merger, and did nothing but lose value ever since aside from a week or two of random blips. Their guidance after earnings was poor and the market doesn't like the current outlook.

I had shares of PSFE at $14 and sold at $12-13 after seeing the writing on the wall although I made a lot selling cc when the IV was high. I hold a few hundred shares of SOFI and am not selling regardless of how low the price goes due to so many upcoming catalysts like earnings and the bank charter."
2021-07-01 17:50:24,stocks,SOFI will just have to go up.
2021-07-01 05:07:20,stocks,I'm riding in both plays.   Long term hold for me so I'm adding anytime it's below my average.  Long term 3-5 years

2021-07-01 15:11:08,stocks,Sofi acquired a bank charter and a ton of money to expand their operations recently.
2021-07-01 06:24:37,stocks,"You have a valid point. At the same time, i think everything is pretty much expensive in their current valuation in stock market nowadays."
2021-07-01 14:31:16,stocks,"Then I would suggest looking at what SoFi HAS done, solid growth in successive quarters, profitable now, expanding user base, acquisition of Galileo, etc etc. It has catalysts on the near horizon as well, strong EBDITA. No doubt it's turning into a congested sector, lots of competition, but as of right now it's the only one stop shop and with a bank charter it'll increase revenue substantially."

2021-07-01 07:12:41,stocks,"Even in the Netherlands it‚Äôs still a painful subject, however there are also quite a few political parties that want to legalize some hard drugs as well, talking about mostly XTC, Cocaine, GHB and mushrooms. 

The problem is the current prevalence of hard drugs, especially in the party scene combined with the illegality and criminality related to it. At most festivals and some clubs (especially dance / techno), you can actually get your XTC checked for free, and going to a festival, you can expect that most people will be using XTC. Lots of people sell it as well.

With the rise in prevalence of drugs, we‚Äôve seen a rise in more vicious criminality as well. Parties who are pro-legalising hard drugs argue that legalising it would decrease the amount of criminality related to it. Which is also the reasoning for why weed was legalized.

While the sale and usage of weed is legal, the cultivation is not. Shops are only allowed to have a very small inventory in their shop, and growing weed is not allowed‚Ä¶ so, where they buy their stuff is illegal.

It is definitely a very weird tolerance construction, and a difficult problem to solve.
I would be very careful investing in the sector, especially as large parts of Europe are still very conservative, and will not welcome this at all."
2021-07-01 09:04:06,stocks,It's so bizarre that we live in a world where alcohol is legal and normalized virtually everywhere yet marijuana is demonized.

Where is safe in a crash? That sort of thing. Take a look around, do some searches for 'crash' or 'bubble', you'll see it. A change in the mood. I track about 10+ finance forums every day, and I keep seeing it coming up every single day on daily threads and topic posts.

Of course, there are always people worrying about downside, the risks, and there are always people yelling the market is about to crash, perma-bears etc. ""Scared money don't make money"", and a stopped clock is right twice a day.  Why might this time be different? 

The backdrop
=====

The market is presently doing well following the idea of the 're-opening play' in addition to the free money fountain of central bank programs and government fiscal stimulus. However, I think the delta strain is going to prevent re-openings lasting more than a few weeks, and I think sentiment is going to turn sharply on that. 

Delta can often break past vaccines, unfortunately, and it spreads like absolute wildfire among the unvaccinated. Regardless, the EU and USA are opening up anyway! Given the R0 of 6 of delta, we should see very rapid spread when mask mandates, lockdown restrictions are removed, and people are socialising like crazy in the Summer of Hedonism. 

I would expect by end July to mid-August, delta will be causing very big problems pretty much everywhere in the world; it's established and spreading in 80+ countries already. Other strains are also a problem and we may see new variants of delta or entirely new strains showing up in the next 2-3 months. 

Do you think delta is the most deadly or infectious variant of covid we'll ever see? 

Consider: it's already about 2.5x faster spreading, more infectious in younger adults, more likely to cause symptomatic disease, new symptoms that can cause it to be misidentified, it has reduced the protectiveness of vaccines noticeably. If you look at the death/infections rate in covid-naive unvaccinated populations like Taiwan, it's potentially a lot more lethal too. That's how much covid 'improved' itself in the 12 months that constituted the bulk of its spread so far, and right now it's spreading (and getting lottery tickets to improve itself) in more people than ever. 

If it's not rapidly eliminated and has another 12 months to circulate, mutate, and continue getting stronger and work around vaccine antibodies, how bad might it become? Are state & national governments in the EU & US & Japan etc taking actions that would eliminate covid before it gets any stronger, or taking actions that will likely allow it to continue to spread and develop?

The Bear Case
=====

My key argument: Central bank and government stimulus programs were timed and globally synchronised on the assumption of the re-opening play throughout this summer. Taxpayer funds and central bank willingness/effectiveness may be exhausted should this continue another year - or two. Does anyone think life around the world will be back to 'business as usual' by the end of summer? Or will it be still 'the end of the beginning' as delta begins to reach the people that alpha failed to reach? The liquidity trap for central banks is also a real concern as printing continues and rates stay close to zero, added to uncertainty about the security of income in many sectors. 

The number of doses of vaccine given worldwide is about 2 billion. The number of doses required to fully vaccinate the world just once is about 16 billion. Will covid continue to circulate and improve? What about new animal strains (remember the mink in Denmark?). What will happen to the stockmarkets and consumer demand in emerging markets with low levels of vaccination? 

Even if covid magically disappeared overnight in the developed world - and it won't - how can the US & EU stockmarkets do well if most of the world is still being ruined by covid and new dangerous strains continue to emerge? 

Now consider: A CAPE10 PER of 38? - 38! good lord! (https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) - Government debts globally hitting dangerously high levels vs GDP in most developed countries? A struggling global supply chain? Stalled, chaotic re-opening plans? This re-opening can't afford to fail, but as delta arrives perfectly timed with summer re-openings and incomplete vaccination, how can it succeed? 

The world is already struggling where delta is well established this month.  https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/weekly-trends/#weekly_table . Some countries where delta is well established already: Russia, Indonesia, Bangladesh. Some countries with highly successful vaccination programs: United Kingdom, Israel, Seychelles. Sort by 'weekly case change' or 'weekly death change', ignore the small countries. Those are 'weekly' figures. Extrapolate out 6-8 weeks. 

For discussion: What do you think is going to happen here? How do you think governments will respond? How do you think the market will respond? 

Other examples
====

Consider: Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, China, New Zealand, were successful in holding back covid for 15 months. But delta sneaked past all their defenses. Now they are engaged in various levels of restrictions to try and stop it. If they can't keep it under control, how are countries with low rates of vaccination and limited/nonexistent restrictions ever going to manage? 

And then we get into the economic costs of continuing to push hard on burned out healthcare systems, the economic costs of long covid, the economic costs of permanent damage to economies  (businesses that went bust and won't ever re-open - hospitality, tourism etc). A lot of businesses can survive a bad year. But it's been 18 months now struggling like this. How many of these businesses can survive 2, maybe 3 terrible years? How much of the economy can we afford to lose before we have a really serious crisis on our hands or permanent economic damage?

Too much like feb 2020
======

To me the whole situation today rhymes far too much with the sentiment and backdrop in February 2020. A deadly strain spreading. Market hitting new highs. Too many big countries not taking it seriously, Asia & ANZ making a serious desperate attempt to stop it spiralling out of control.

The main difference with the February 2020 scenario? We're starting from a far, far, far higher point of stockmarket valuation (the SP500 is not just 'expensive', it's at the 2nd highest point of valuation ever, per CAPE10, and the highest ever in terms of broker margin, buffett ratio). 

The investor backdrop is bubbling hyper-bullish sentiment and outright gambling on most forums, manias and pump/dumps erupting multiple times a day, and bearly [!] an inkling of bearishness. Yet we're going forward from here with companies AND consumers AND governments AND central banks that have taken a balance-sheet beating for the last 15 months. We're looking at a far more deadly strain of disease that spreads faster, hits harder. We're looking at governments that have already burned out the political support and willingness-to-suffer of their populations.

This is not a recipe for success. This is a recipe for March 2020... on steroids. 

Some counter-arguments against my case
=========

> ""The vaccines are effective and will bring covid to a halt"". 

By definition, disease with a natural R>3 will continue to circulate even if vaccines are 66% effective against infection and 100% of the population is fully vaccinated. Contrast: The R of delta is around 6, the effectiveness of one of the best vaccines (AZN) is around 60%, and barely a handful of countries will have fully-vaccinated rates above 50% by the end of summer. 

> ""Well, OK, vaccines won't stop it, but they will stop people dying of it. That's what matters. We don't lockdown for 20000 flu deaths/year.""

What we are seeing from delta is that AZN & PFE/MDNA vaccines are **extremely** effective at preventing death generally, though less so in older people or immunocompromised people. I have read that a fully vaccinated 80 y/o has about the same chances vs covid as an unvaccinated 50 y/o, but I don't have the source to hand right now; sounds about right though. 

Vaccines aren't nearly so effective at stopping someone spreading covid to vulnerable members of their family. While vaccines have a wonderful effect in reducing hospitalisations too, delta hits hard and spreads fast, so hospitals are already beginning to get quite busy again as a result. The problem is that this means regular hospital operation is going to be affected. If you have a hospital full of ultra-hyper-contagious-but-not-deadly plague, you can't be doing regular surgeries etc. So people will unfortunately die from that, from delayed surgeries etc, specialities on hold to help out in the covid wards. Flu has an R around 1.5 and it slams the hospital system hard every year. An ongoing (and worsening into the end of the year) slamming of the hospital system with a mostly-non-lethal-but-still-needs-oxygen/vent disease, that spreads between wards with an R of 6, that is a different matter. There's also the issue that e.g. teachers, retail, dentists, doctors, hospital staff are simply exhausted and emotionally burned out from dealing with this. The systems are under a huge amount of pressure as it is even today. It isn't realistic to expect governments to keep saying 'tough shit', all the public 'ignoring' covid all around, while these sectors crumble under the pressure.   

> ""Regardless of whether it spreads, or whether people are dying, no matter how bad it gets, governments will simply not lock down again. End of story.""

We saw in Sweden last year that if governments fail to enact a lockdown, a large part of the public will do it themselves anyway. And many businesses cannot operate at full productivity if workers keep falling ill and ending up long-term sick or in hospital, even if those workers remain alive. Many businesses cannot profitably operate on 30-50% custom. Ultimately, democratic governments cannot force you to go out and get slammed by a deadly plague providing you have enough money in the bank to avoid it. The retail & hospitality economy will not prosper if the only people out shopping/eating/holidaying are those unable to afford the luxury of hiding at home from a massive covid outbreak.

Random things
====

Remember, whether it's 1987 or 2020, you don't get a warning before the rug gets pulled from under your feet. A trip down memory lane. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ES4uVEcXsAEqZkT?format=jpg&name=4096x4096 . https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51829852 . Not that long ago, really?

Also - ""Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy"", the sage wrote. But what does **greedy** look like? Does it look like 'my stock is worth $1m/share'? No. **Greedy** looks like this: smart, sensible, sane people saying things like 'well OK, sure this market seems pretty weird, idiots being stupid, but the music's still playing, and I think there's still time to skim a quick 5-10% and get out before it all falls apart. There will be a bit of warning before shit hits the fan; I'll run for the exit when I see it'. 

The steamroller has arrived, it is right there, towering over them, but still their eyes are on the pennies on the ground, even though they know they ought to know better. But it hasn't started squishing ... yet. Then the moment arrives, and the door for everyone to get out is...  so very narrow. Painfully mixed metaphors but you see my point. 

Finally
===

Disclosure; I am now completely out of the market.

Some further material for thought:  https://www.gmo.com/europe/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/

A closing note: every day, the next major stockmarket crash always gets one day closer. It's like the theta decay on a long-dated option whose expiry date is a secret. Hardly there at all for months or years, the signal lost in the noise, then suddenly, it arrives, it's the day, and everything is gone at once. 

Stay safe everyone, get your vaccines, and don't catch the plague. The zero-th rule of making money is: be alive to enjoy it.

p.s. If you think what I've written is wrong/stupid fair enough but  don't downvote this purely because you are currently long in the market and don't like seeing bearish sentiment. I would very much welcome thoughtful & evidence-based criticism of what I'm presenting here. I would love to be wrong about this."
2021-07-01 06:38:35,stocks,"I think there is too much covid exhaustion. People will just live there lives spending money at this point and everybody will either get exposed and develope antibodies or they'll die, but people are going to go out to beaches, restaurants, sporting events and concerts regardless. There's no way people will tolerate another lockdown in my opinion. Even the governments seem over it. Overall the next 3 or 4 quarters will be steadily up, until rates start getting more and more talked about getting tweaked.

I have hedged against the moratorium ending in the United States tho. I'm targeting commercial real estate puts prioritizing small and mid caps. Mostly puts around a November expiration at give or take -7%."

2021-07-01 09:09:48,stocks,"Those countries that were initially successful in holding off the virus, but are now dealing with outbreaks, made the mistake of not vaccinating their population with the same urgency as others like the US and Israel.

I only follow the situation in Taiwan and Australia, and both of them had 1% vaccination rate when outbreaks hit them.

Just because you were able to mostly keep it out initially, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre home safe. Now a more dangerous variant appears and 99% of your population has zero immunity to it."
2021-07-01 07:36:23,stocks,"‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get a warning before the rug gets pulled out from under your feet‚Äù.

This is the market. Invest or don‚Äôt. I think most people agree the market is overvalued but there is always opportunity somewhere. If you need to take a break, do so. I don‚Äôt think the fear mongering serves any purpose. 

Crashes require a catalyst. Until the catalyst happens the bubble will continue. Predicting a catalyst is near impossible unless you have unique information."
2021-07-01 05:32:52,stocks,"Tldr: me see article about big crash. Me scared. Anyone who says they know when the next crash just wants your money. 

The market is not going to crash in the next 8 weeks. Will there be a small correction in the next few months? Probably, no one knows. Earnings are going to once again show big companies are money printing machines and spy will only go up."
2021-07-01 04:20:02,stocks,If delta gets that bad the market will moon like we‚Äôve never seen before. No one is selling stocks because of Covid anymore. That was a one time thing specific to February-March 2020. Those who got shook out when Covid first hit are not going to do that again.

2021-07-01 09:29:23,stocks,"Needless to say, at least in the case of the US, the ship sailed a long time ago on another full on crash that is directly due to COVID.

I've got swampland for you if you think anybody is actually going to listen in this country on lockdowns. 

Doesn't rule out that you could see a change in approach because of worries over COVID. But that playbook has been seen already and ran at times after March last year. It's called ""because of strength from the Nasdaq, not much else matters,"" and if you don't think it can't continue, you haven't been paying attention."
2021-07-01 05:20:08,stocks,"March 2020 had little to do with Covid. The Repo market broke down when a massive amount of off the run treasuries got offloaded, everything after that was knock on effects. Was it offloaded due to covid fears?

2021-07-01 10:10:46,stocks,"Despite the Delta variant and infection spikes in certain places, the virus is WAY MORE under control than in was last year. It's not even close. I predict that numbers will continue to plateau for a while, but anyone saying that we're going back to lockdowns is fear mongering.

And you can't really compare the market conditions of March 2020 to now. During the huge selloff, no one knew what was going to happen. We still knew almost nothing about the virus, and governments hadn't started fiscal stimulus yet. The selloff priced in way more economic damage than actually happened.

I believe the next financial crisis will be caused by excessive debt levels, and will play out differently than previous crashes."
2021-07-01 10:36:47,stocks,Man I love how much energy people put into explaining that it makes PERFECT SENSE a crash is coming in the next X weeks. Nobody gets it right lol. And even if some random dude got it right it'd be the 50th time he'd be predicting the crash.
2021-07-01 10:46:26,stocks,If the trucking/logistics issue is as bad as it seems prices will keep soaring as well as the markets.
2021-07-01 10:58:27,stocks,"Nice read-up, but consider investing in a few stocks to hedge against a crash rather than pulling money completely.

This environment is crazy, but where else are you going to park your money? Real estate made a bull run, commodities made a bull run, the fed is printing like crazy (so don‚Äôt hold cash), and good luck with buying 10 year notes (1.5% is under the inflation rate).

2021-07-01 12:09:29,stocks,I doubt there is going to be a crash that soon. Although I wouldn't rule out a 10% correction in that timeframe.

If your vaccinated your fine. Full stop. No conditions. You. Are. Fine. The delta variant offers no more risk to a vaccinated individual than ""normal"" covid. 

And this is partly because normal covid isn't a thing that exists. Virus mutate very very quickly and ""variants"" are very common. If vaccines fell apart against variants the vaccine would have been useless before it was even distributed, because they were made like 8 months or something before distribution began. Which is forever for a virus."

3. the Fed says no interest rate hikes til 2023, a safe year and a half from now. 
4. housing market currently strong.

we definitely don't. this is just a straight out lie lmao. and the reason why the market crashed in 2020 was because of uncertainty. the government was completely blindsided from covid and had no idea what to do. companies had no idea what the fuck were going to happen so everyone sold in fear. if theoretically everything happened again, the market wouldn't care because having literally experienced this a year ago, the government would be able to take effective action with its newly gained experience

We will hopefully be able and more willing to adapt to safety protocol etc after the pandemic). If we assume that the overpriced sectors you mention are indeed that then a correction will occur regardless.

min wage growth is happening quickly, and people are also voluntarily leaving the workforce. fast wage raises = less hiring to save money and small businesses suffer, leading to sustained unemployment when these people finally try to go get a new job because no one can afford to hire

economy is superficially improving, done so by money printers going full blast and adding to debt and budget deficits. 

FED already bumped the date up once, some people including myself are thinking it comes 2022 rather than 23. 

housing market is overpriced to these younger families because boomers are driving the price up, also many people with student loans are ineligible for mortgages due to debt-to-asset ratio, and the renting market isn't doing much better, and lumber is insanely overvalued. my neighborhood decreased in value by $3k/house on avg over the past month after 25k jump on avg in prices, so could be the start of the end imo. 

even with vaccines, the delta variant could and probably will still lead to shutdowns on some level. 

When the gov't stops stimulating retail and individuals and starts bailing out only big banks and businesses, that's when the money dries up for families and they stop spending, and possibly default on their debts.

Popular investing platform Robinhood has agreed to pay nearly $70 million to the financial industry regulatory authority (FINRA) to settle allegations that the brokerage caused customers ‚Äúwidespread and significant‚Äù harm on multiple different fronts over the past few years. That is the largest financial penalty ever ordered by the organization, a non-government entity authorized by Congress to oversee hundreds of thousands of brokers across the U.S. Specifically, FINRA‚Äôs investigation found that millions of customers received false or misleading information from Robinhood on a variety of issues, including how much money customers had in their accounts, whether they could place trades on margin and more.

The inaccurate information cost customers more than $7 million, FINRA found, and Robinhood is required to pay restitution to affected users. Other allegations addressed in the settlement include that Robinhood approved risky options trades for thousands of users when it should not have and did not do enough to prevent system outages in March 2020 that adversely affected millions of users. Robinhood has invested in improving the platform and is building out its customer service team, Robinhood spokesperson Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay writes to CNBC Make It in an emailed statement about the settlement.

‚ÄúWe are glad to put this matter behind us and look forward to continuing to focus on our customers and democratizing finance for all,‚Äù she says. Robinhood was launched in 2014 and attracted millions of customers, many of them first-time investors, with its easy-to-use app and industry-changing commission-free trades. But it has come under fire multiple times in the past few years, most recently during the GameStop rally earlier this year when it restricted trading. FINRA‚Äôs investigation found that Robinhood‚Äôs customer service issues go back much further. Between 2018 and 2020, for example, Robinhood failed to report tens of thousands of customer complaints to FINRA that it was required to report, the organization says.

FINRA also alleges that Robinhood has ‚Äúnegligently communicated false and misleading information‚Äù at different times since September 2016. Those misleading and false statements had hurt customers financially, FINRA found. The report also referenced the tragic story of a customer with details matching that of 20-year-old Alex Kearns, an investor who died by suicide in June 2020 after Robinhood showed a negative cash balance of $720,000 in his account. FINRA found that his balance was inaccurate, and that the value of his position was half of what the account displayed. While Robinhood has offered options trading since December 2017, FINRA says it has ‚Äúfailed to exercise due diligence before approving customers to place options trades,‚Äù relying on algorithms, rather than people, to approve customers for the risky investing move.

‚ÄúAs a result, Robinhood approved thousands of customers for options trading who either did not satisfy the firm‚Äôs eligibility criteria or whose accounts contained red flags indicating that options trading may not have been appropriate for them,‚Äù FINRA writes. Finally, the company failed to supervise the technology it uses to provide its core services between January 2018 and February 2021, resulting in a series of outages and systems failures. One of these outages occurred on March 2 and March 3, 2020, during extreme market volatility. FINRA says these outages cost certain individual customers tens of thousands of dollars. Robinhood did not admit nor deny the charges, and it still under investigation by the SEC. On Wednesday, the company published a blog post to highlight the changes it has implemented to address customer concerns."

I dont think they will be fined for GME. The loss is more reputation as many traders went to other platforms. But Robinhood would do ok. They still have 80B in customer assets. But its going to be uber expensive stock and I think this product is a commodity without any strong moat. That said I would not short this stock for sure(I dont short anything anyway).

2021-07-01 08:12:23,stocks,"Garbage company. I left them last year for Schwab. 

I hate to say it but real brokerages will make you know they're a real brokerage. I didn't care about Gamestop nonsense, and still don't, but when Robinhood said they weren't supporting REITs anymore (which turned out to be a mistake on their webpage, because they are so effing stupid they don't even know what REITs are) I decided to go elsewhere.   


They're practically anti-dividend, don't support any type of IRA, report completely false stock metrics pretty often (this is \*bad\*), and offer almost no research that isn't from Morningstar... you can't put real money into a company like that.   


What bites me, is I defended them for a little while. How does a brokerage not know what a REIT is? Isn't that scary? How can they misreport stock metrics like it's no big deal? No phone number?   


I once emailed them demanding they move some residual dividends I had over to Schwab and their response was a boilerplate email informing me on how to move money back into them lol. I tore them up."

It's deemed it was illegal blah blah blah  . 100 million in restitution.  But in restitution to who? And don't say class action lawsuits because that's not what this is.

>Robinhood users and force-sold their GME shares?





I have never seen anyone back this up on Reddit or otherwise. A Verge article that talks to a total of 1 person doesn't prove anything. Also, closing a trader's positions if they are using margin or implementing a strange option strategy is common practice by every single broker when markets get crazy. It is allowed and not illegal in any way. If they sold off actual shares and there was actual evidence of it happening to people then you may have an argument.







Second, 





>are you unaware that Robinhood turned off the buy button for Robinhood users









This also isn't illegal. And, Robinhood literally had to do this due to not being able to meet the new margin requirements set by the DTCC hours prior. Legally, all brokerages must clear their trades through a clearinghouse. So, either Robinhood breaks the law and doesn't clear their trades or it has to stop people from buying to lower the requirements. Pretty obvious choice and easily the right thing to do.






The point of the clearinghouse is to secure both sides of the trade. If a brokerage doesn't use a clearinghouse then there is a risk of you buying/selling a stock and getting nothing in return if the counterparty can't complete their side of the trade."

That doesn't matter at all. DTCC margin requirements aren't going to change based on who is doing the clearing. 








>Many other self-clearing firms (e.g. Fidelity and Vanguard) must have also been given the new collateral requirements from DTCC, yet they did not restrict GME or AMC buys.








Because collateral requirements are specific each brokerage based on the DTCC's risk calculations and the trades being done on each specific brokerage. If Robinhood's userbase was more active in trading GME and the other meme stocks during this period then the percent increase in the collateral requirement would reflect that and be much higher than other brokerages.






Robinhood had cash on hand for any potential increases in colleterial. They just didn't have 10x the typical requirement. And why would they? This type of increase in collateral is exceedingly rare and most brokerages probably haven't ever faced it."

TL;DR tickers: TSLA, ARKX, ROKT, UFO, INTEQ, IRDM, ASTS

We can‚Äôt invest in Starlink, and I wish we could. I‚Äôm looking for stocks & ETFs to benefit from Starlink and Starship. I am holding $TSLA IPO, and that‚Äôs good stuff.

First the ETFs. $ARKX. Kind of some out of the box choices, but it is clearly built around Starship being a big deal in coming years. Space will be much cheaper. I also have $ROKT & $UFO. Those aren‚Äôt geared around Starlink, but I want to own space stocks.

$GOGO. They sold their commercial aviation division to Iridium ($INTEQ.) The bankruptcy court approved INTEQ buying the division. I bought some INTEQ on the cheap, even though I know better than to buy a stock while in bankruptcy. (INTEQ is a huge government and military space server provider with lots of assets in orbit, btw.) Anyway, GOGO now only services private jets.  With no space assets and a dominant position for cell data, they could greatly benefit from Starlink.

While looking for Starlink plays, I found some stocks that seem to be outside of the reach of Starlink.

$IRDM. Iridium does old school sat phones. Pretty amazing for data emergencies if you are at sea or hiking on a mountain. These are places Starlink cannot cover well.

$ASTS. These cats are trying to send normal cell signals from satellites. Best I can tell, the tech looks legit. If it works, it will be very valuable. In fact, it will kill $IRDM, probably. I do not know if it will work, so this is a gamble. Worth the gamble, I think.

2021-07-01 01:31:11,stocks,"I know what you mean lol. I have some other stuff but I was planning to put it all into ASTS by the end of the year, because I wasn't expecting movement until the BW-3 launch at EOY."
2021-07-01 01:30:22,stocks,"88k is the value of my ASTS holdings right now, yeah. Cost basis is hard to count right now, but technically according to my broker I spent about 33k"
2021-07-01 03:29:36,stocks,"I'm curious as to what you think about this. I bought ASTS at 10$. I didn't put too much in, but Im considering to double down or even put in 3x the first amount. 

Would you wait or do would you put in an order at 12-13$? 

I work at a firm that's leading in the 5G area, in my country. I love the potential of this stock, but Im worried that my 30% gains are clouding my judgement."
2021-07-01 01:32:05,stocks,I love cost basis.
2021-07-01 04:05:04,stocks,"Tbh, I'm not sure how it will act from now on with its first price target it received from Deutsche Bank yesterday. That was huge for ASTS hence the 30ish% day it had.

12 could be the new floor, we'll see. I would wait for a day or two maybe to see how it stabilizes.

In the 10s, its an easy add for sure. 11s should be safeish too imo."
2021-07-01 04:08:06,stocks,"Thanks for the reply. Your thoughts run similar to my own. It seems like a good idea to watch how it acts these next few days.

I feel like 12 is a fair target. Taking into consideration that there's no product yet. 

Thanks for your thoughts."
2021-07-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Everyone is expecting a crash, so be greedy when others are fearful? So this week my email and youtube recommendations are full of ""THE BIGGEST CRASH IN THE HISTORY"", ""THE GUY WHO PREDICTED THE 2008 CRASH IS WARNING YOU"", and here on Reddit every day there is a post about an incoming crash, also the fear and greed index is the fear territory,   
so following the advice of the old man  "" Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.""  
but on the other hand, the market is reaching a new ATH, so my question for the people who lived the previous crashes, was it fear the dominant emotion is driving the market? or everyone was partying and greedy and suddenly the sky fall on them?"
2021-06-30 22:59:22,stocks,"Predicting a crash is not what they mean when they say ‚Äúfearful‚Äù

2021-06-30 23:39:22,stocks,"Be greedy when others are fearful means buying those stocks that are cheap because people have sold them.   (After a crash).  Before a crash,  be cautious when others are greedy. Build a cash reserve when others are greedy (if they are willing to pay for stocks that are significantly over priced,  then sell it to them)."
2021-06-30 23:17:43,stocks,"Yahoo has an article with the Rich Dad, Poor Dad author saying we are heading to the greatest crash in the history of the world.  IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.... so presumably worse than 1929, worse than the 1930s... worse than 2009.  Worse than COVID nearly shutting down the global economy for a few months.   Worse than the Black Death, worse than the collapse of Rome.   All because of massive debts and endless spending.   But don't fret, because he's got it all sorted with some advice on how to prepare.  

Buy ammo and food and prep in a bunker full of batteries and drinking water?  Nope... buy gold, b***oin, start a business, and stop trying to live debt free...  I am not even joking.  His advice to prep for a near apocalyptic debt fueled economic collapse is to  leverage up and go put your life on the line by starting a business... a business that does well in economic collapses.  You know... for all of the customers that will be lining up for the end of the world."

The perma-bears will be right eventually, but they've been crying wolf for over a year now while prices continue to rise. Not listening to some jagoff with his jaw dropped & flames in the background has proven to be the right move. Remind yourself of why you chose a stock or ETF on those red days and see if your thesis remains intact.

Depending on your time horizon, you'll live through some crashes and corrections. I can't guarantee or even confidently predict when and to what extent, but they'll happen. I find solace in knowing they're inevitable and zooming out to see longer term charts."

If you saw someone saying 'yeah there's a steamroller coming but I've still got time to pick up all these pennies on the street in front of it' you wouldn't say they were fearful. You would say they were insanely greedy.

If these people were 'fearful' they'd be dumping their stocks at any price and buying puts. But they're buying calls and yolo-ing into the dumbest stuff you can imagine.

If you would have waited after the 08 crash for the next one, you would have literally missed all of Obama‚Äôs gains. Not only that, if you waited for the crash and there is one, getting in at the bottom is almost impossible to make it worth it. Buy high quality stocks. If there is a crash, add more to them. No use in worrying if there going to be a crash or when. I‚Äôve been hearing about a crash since 2011 when markets recovered from the financial crisis. I do think that the speculative market is going to crash but not the stock market any time soon. The crashes happen when it‚Äôs least expected.

Again, not financial advice, I see greed in the market and I'm adjusting my exposure: taking profits, hedging positions, holding cash. My plan is to be in a good position for when fear hits, when panic selling hits, when the talking heads begin to talk about the ""worst sell off since 2008."" 

When there is blood in streets, I'll be ready to shop and trust me, I plan on going shopping. I forget who said it and I'm paraphrasing: fortunes are made during recessions.

POTUS reassigned covid relief for police training quoting a incoming ""wave of crime"" ...

Tidal wave of evictions filed that can be seen that cannot be processed until eviction protections end..

Physical removal during evictions, like in 08, are still done by police right?

Doesn't seem evil they are training an eviction squad while sheep clothing a last month help extension on evictions? 

Major indexes have taken a hit, banks are going insolvent? (Credit suisse)

Major whales like Blackrock are guarding against inflation wildly with massive property buying in Canada and the US AT 15% above asking? (Back to RRPs)

New financial laws being implemented every week after years of nothing?

Even Warren buffet took out puts on treasury bonds (our central collateral system now) because of massive bond and etf shorting?

If those seem like the signs of a healthy economy to you, then idk what to tell you

But hey, POTUS had an important meeting with the treasury, sec and other financial high members, very all of a sudden, and said ""our economy is strong"", im sure anyone who survived 08 knows what that means

So be greedy if you want, why not?

Massive inflation knocking, market crash looming, corporate housing over leveraged, and junk bonds with etfs massively shorted... gotta try to survive somehow right?"

We are currently in a recession according to the Fed and I think it's a very reasonable stance.   

Personally I think we are on the upswing from said recession.  

Are the people expecting a crash in the short term, here, I don't care to discuss clickbait, expecting a double dip recession?  If so, what do you think the catalyst for that will be? Or do you believe we haven't really ""priced in"" the current recession? The recovery was too quick?"

Homeless and unemployed!!!!!!"
2021-07-01 10:37:35,stocks,"Meme stock mania is about 20 stocks getting pumped to less than 100 billion in value.  Dotcom surge took hundreds of companies along for a multiyear ride that involved hundreds of billions if not trillions (when you include private investment rounds, ipo's, and the peripheral moves in s&p and Dow higher over the same period).  The SPAC trend was getting a lot closer to this mania than the hype/meme stock move.   

Housing itself is getting too hit, but do we have 30 years of increasing volumes if mbs products and cdo build up that is about to totter over.  It is certainly likely rising, but I doubt it has reached systemic (insurance and reinsurance company levels for potential trillion dollar of balance sheet holes)."
2021-07-01 19:00:19,stocks,"Don't forget due to inflation there are rising wages en masse. Just got a job for $14/hr, $15 after 90 days when normal pay is $12, because of voluntary workforce exodus. 

Sure, large businesses can keep up. They can raise wages, cut a few positions, and barely raise costs, match inflation. Small businesses, who nearly went under from first pandemic, cannot afford wage raises without cutting more positions than viable, or raising prices to the point no one wants to pay. Then, we get deflation and lay-offs on smaller scales. Deflation hurts big corp pockets, so then they start laying off too, since they can't lower wages or raise prices. 

With the mortgage rates, second mortgages/vacation homes are at all-time highs, so when these layoffs come, how soon do the defaults on debt start? 

Unless gov't steps in and breaks the knobs on those money printers to keep em spewing 24/7 to bail out the economy, which will just contribute to more debt and taxes and such, I don't see a pretty ending to this situation.

On top of: possible second wave of pandemic and the dismissive attitudes of the people who matter. ""We have the foresight, hindsight, and general knowledge of economy to prevent such a major depression from occuring again"" seems like ignorance to me, ignoring the very real possibility that they don't know what the fuck they're doing and just going ""this seems like the best choice"" it is still a new situation, new circumstance, something not experienced in this way, and people are saying we know how to prevent it from getting worse?? Sounds like pouring random fluids on a fire and hoping one is water.

To be fair, I'm bullish in general and don't see anything major developing til mid 2022 when I expect rates to rise, I don't like feeling like a ""doomsdayer"" and I'm not saying a crash is imminent, it just seems like it is a very real probability that people are underestimating.

I think it would be worse than 2008, but not worse than the great depression. My bearish TA view on DJI is correction June 2022, bottom 2025, recovery 2027."
2021-07-01 15:07:05,stocks,"Yes, that is certainly one way of viewing things.  To be honest, I think the unfettered anything goes markets of the 1980s through 2000s are the culprits.   Too many future years of income were pulled forward while selling the benefits of just in time supply chains to reduce costs and gutting the productive capacity of the economy through offshoring and outsourcing to lower costs as ways to boost earnings and justify the higher valuations.   Then, the higher valuations necessitate, and are built upon, liquidation tactics and business plans to turn a profit.  

Technological change has played a large role as well.  Think of just one example-- moving from LPs to tapes to Cds then to mp3 players.  The three former all required basic materials and manufacturing for production, stores and sales people,  transportation jobs for moving to stores, and furniture at home for storage.  The manufacturing required machines/tools/consumables/maintenance, which all in turn had their own networks and needs. Vinyl, cardboard, plastic, resins, paper, artwork, and (shrinking) liner notes all turned into a download.  Enormous amounts of production, transportation, and sales jobs/infrastructure/capacity wiped out.   

You do the same to 100 other businesses and you have hollowed out the economy.  Think about all the capacity surrounding camera and film that has been wiped out-- plastics, chemicals, packaging, papers, developing companies, photobooks and storage, etc.    Initially the benefit was that it was cheaper, less materialistic, less bulky, more portable.  Then, just cost-- look at how cheap it is to stream instead of buy.  It is cheap.  It has to be-- wages across the country have not moved in nearly a decade.  And why should they?  Inflation has been low because of technology-- the technology that cuts your expenses has capped your wages as well.    

I AM NOT saying the old ways were ""better"" or should be brought back.   I am just calling attention to how much employment and production there used to be when download and streaming companies were not trillion dollar enterprises and millions were employed at living wage and better with multiple employer paid benefits.  We had millions of people producing tangible, exportable, goods.  Now we make sandwiches, clean hotel rooms, and wait tables as a ""core"" section of the economy, for less than living wages. 

Oh well.  I am sure the buggy and wagon manufacturers felt the same too.  It just seems like they actually had a boom of jobs and opportunities on the horizon.  We are steadily reducing ours."

  It is hard to get past him saying the reason there will be crash is because of huge amounts of debt, ie debt is the root of our current/future demise.  Then to quickly add that he has always been heavily leveraged and does not see the point of people wanting a debt free life.   If that is beneficial, the benefits come to a halt in a deflationary crash.  You might have your debts cleared in a bankruptcy, but where would your customers and income come from on these assets if the entire system just experienced the worst crash in this history of the world?

35k into ETFs. Remaining 5k into the three stocks you think look good. Or 3k into 5 stocks, or 2k into 7 stocks.  Periodically look at how your picks perform against the ETFs and see if you want to dabble more in stocks or stay with ETFs.

- GOOGL
- MSFT

As far as ETFs go these are all you will ever need...

- VOO: SP 500
- VONG: Vanguard Russell 1000 growth index 
- VOOV: Vanguard Value index

If you want any reasoning or explanations for any of it let me know. We should all make our own informed investment decisions. Those were just companies that I wouldn‚Äôt mind owning outright if I had the opportunity to, so that‚Äôs why I trusted so much of my capital in them."
2021-06-30 23:35:38,stocks,Awesome position to be in.  Take 6k and throw it into a Roth IRA...it's tax advantaged and since you don't need the money then have it grow there for retirement.  You won't pay taxes on it.  Take the remaining 44k and put it into a different account and buy the aristocrats....companies that have a stellar record with paying their dividends and going up....Microsoft is on that list.  Every year transfer the max contribution for your Roth.  The dividends will compound your growth and allow you to buy other shares.  Inside the Roth buy REITs (real estate investment trusts). They pay dividends at higher rates and do so monthly.  Again you will never pay taxes on this money and it will be there for retirement.  Keep enough for an attorney and pre nup when/if you decide to get married.  Nothing worse than having to share profits with someone who didn't take the risks or make the investment.

No, but turns out everything has chips in it nowadays and has an incredible moat. It‚Äôs also 1/5 price of AMD and about 1/7 of NVDA on value metrics.

2021-06-30 23:56:02,stocks,"Don‚Äôt invest in an index fund.  There are too many shit companies in them - do you really want to own a bunch of oil & gas companies in 2021?  What about a bunch of media companies like Viacom getting their cables cut right under their noses?  Invest in companies that will continue to innovate and last until you‚Äôre 70.  The ones you picked are far better than the average S&P 500 company, and their valuations are all reasonable.  I would bet my life Microsoft outperforms the S&P 500 for the next 20 years (won‚Äôt be hard to do either, 8-9% is so much lower than Microsoft‚Äôs long term earnings growth potential).

Whatever you do, don‚Äôt look for big dividends now.  Dividend stocks are for retired people looking for fixed income - means the company has thrown in the towel in trying to redeploy capital for growth and thinks it‚Äôs better off giving it back to shareholders.  You‚Äôre too young of a shareholder to invest in these types of companies.

Think about what products you love and cannot live without, and what product people 20-30 years from now won‚Äôt be able to live without.

Personally, I‚Äôm a huge fan of companies like Unity that will be crucial in 20 years when VR is a huge part of our daily lives, or companies like Lemonade that‚Äôs upending an old industry, or companies like Shopify that‚Äôs the best in its class in an industry with unlimited TAM."

Wouldn't call em a meme stock anymore, their fundamentals are pretty disgustingly solid.

[www.gmedd.com](https://www.gmedd.com) literally thousands of people submit DD here including registered professionals that review submissions before uploading.

TL;DR GME is on sale, and it's looking like a potential run up to 1200 as it's baseline, on fundamentals alone.

You can literally ignore all the short situational stuff and still make money if you just afk for a few years. You can see the fact the DD is right by how many analysts have completely changed tune or stopped covering GME because their bosses are short the stock.

&#x200B;

KTOS has seen some gains and I would posit they'll be seeing some more in days to come as some of their more clandestine contracts see the light of day.

BMY was on sale earlier, but I exited my position at 67 for gme shares and SOFI calls.

SOFI has some ridiculous upside as well, they're looking at acquiring a bank charter before year end, so will be able to complete all transactions they offer, themselves, instead of as a broker or dealer, they can work as a market participant potentially becoming a market maker in the long term."

2021-07-01 03:01:12,stocks,"A sweet, 'widows n orphans, healthy, reliable, dividend monster, stock is akin to a bowl or scoop of luscious Blue Bell Ice Cream, or like a perfectly made, Pastrami sandwich, on Pumpernickel bread, with dill pickle spear.  You don't walk away mad, like when merciless, lying, promising, scorpion on the frog's back across the river, growth, momentum, meme, or sham stocks lie to you and then roundhouse kick you in the mouth for your stupid sins.

In these anti-Trump, anti-Clintonian, wild ride times, then I would strongly suggest a healthy high dividend stock you don't have to look at every day or night.  Think about it for just a sec.  Growth, Momentum,, and Crypto, are all over the friggin place, ricocheting all over the up and down markets.  WTH is the difference between that baby diaper present, Or the loyal, steady, dividend stock?  You might as well get that dividend, like the happiness of no longer having to go clubbing to find a mate, once you settle down and get married.

The dividend stock becomes like a wife, or husband.  Maybe you're not acting an A$$, out at the Roxburry, each night anymore, YET at least you lie down decently at night, next to your spouse, or significant other, and you know who the heck you are, or are not, with the morning light!

Brittish American Tobacco(BTI), ORC, OCCI, OXLC, HTGC, or my all time favorite, CLM.  GLO, GLQ, and GLV, or the Clough Closed End Funds, have super discounts, as their share prices hover below their Net Asset Values, which equals sweet highway robbery to closed end fund management company junkies.  Other good divs are: T; IBM; Broadcom; INTC; WELL; PEAK; MAA; SUI: SAN; NHI; O; STAG; ECC; NMFC; PSEC; ANLY; AGNC; PSEC; Pennymac; MIC; BRK.B; Brookfield; MAC; SPG; and if AIV ever cooks up their dividend again.

Crypto is NOT for me.  I hate the tax issues, and if I ever did it I would hold it long, like for years, possibly decades, since taxes $UCK.  These whippersnappers have this naive, vague, unsyllogistic, view, like Capin' Jack, or whatever, that they can just hack an oilfield pipeline, a turkey factory, whatever, and just get away with it by tracing crypto, as what they stupidly see as some 'anonymous drug payment system,' which is anything but.

They have never heard the term, 'block chain.'  Duhhhhhhh?  It is a friggin chain, people.  And its a taxable one, at that.  Crypto is BLOCKCHAIN.  IT is NOT anonymous.  If you want to do a crime, and get paid, get paid trans via a cash stacks jam packed briefcase somewhere, or get paid in gold bars, copper, silver, or paladium.  Don't get paid in crypto, since it is a chain, a chain that can be certainly traced via the 'block chain.'  If the IRS can trace it don't think their cousins, the FBI, CIA, or NSA, have no ability to.

REIT stocks, and closed end funds(CEFs), or closed end management companies, sound like they'd be matches made in Heaven for you.

If you want a blindfold go Growth, Momentum, EV, or Meme stock.  Or, throw it into crypto, like Ethereum, and forgot you even knew about it.  If you jump off the crypto high dive, then stay in it.  Don't sell.  Don't sell until you have well enough to pay a long-term gains tax on your crypto profits.

Hey, at least if it goes down, or just stays level, which Div stocks have Not been doing as of late(they've been going UP under Biden), you still get your dividend, quarterly, or monthly.  That's enough money that the DIV could pay a rent, pay some bills, or just buy some groceries, or fund some decent partying at home, for goodness sakes!

50K is a sweet A$$ed monthly, Or even quarterly, Gividend, if you stop to scratch your head and think about it for a sec.

See, all these young, crypto, whippersnappers have no foggy clue that each time they buy, and then sell, crypto at a profit, they therefore incur a short-term capital gain, and that that is taxed.  The level it is taxed depends upon their income level.  Now, if they hold the crypto for at least a year, then they only pay the smaller, long-term, capital gain on the profit.  I'm not sure whether you can deduct crypto losses as a short-term, or long-term, capital loss, or not?

Same thing, when people buy, or sell, stock, outside of retirement accounts, they incur one of four things: short-term capital gain; short-term capital loss; long-term capital gain, or long-term capital loss.

There is an old tradition on Wall Street called, 'Widows and Orphans Dividend STocks.'  Those were conservative stock that men would buy to financially protect their wives and kids, especially with all the extremely lethal world wars going on back then, and the lessons of the Great Depression.  These were rock solid, juicy, dividend stocks, which paid out divs reliably, and which either went level, a little down over time, or slightly up.  Picture the arch-opposite of mood swings and volatile growth or momentum shock stock.

Get a widows and orphans stock, one that you study first.  Look at one day, five day, one week, one month, six months, YTD, one year, five year, and MAX stock charts on it.  Feel comfortable with this one.  The best of both worlds is to find a unicorn widows and orphans stock you never have to touch, which oddly combines a bit of growth, with a tad of momentum, with a deep and prolific dividend that's always paid out and doesn't skip or disappear.

If you still doubt, pick up the phone, or email, and simply leave a message for your broker's secretary to have them call you back, or shoot out an email to them, and ask them their opinion on what stock they feel is best with 50k.  Be SURE to tell them, 'I want to pick this completely self-directed.  I'm tired of actively managed, fully diversified, funds I can't grab the steering wheel on.'

Oh, I almost forgot to mention.  Divs are taxed, but at a lower rate than anything as abserdly high as short-term gains, or even long-term gain.  They send you a convenient, easy to comprehend, 1099-DIV tax form, and if you use either Turbo Tax, H&R, or Intuit, its seamlessly easy.  No worries, and it just takes a little bit off of your refund, or adds a little to your taxes, but Nothing like outright gains costs.

Best of Luck, and May the Stocks be With You!

Google search, or [MSN.com](https://MSN.com) search, 'Highest Dividend Stocks to Buy Today.'  Best of luck.  'But would you have any Grey Poupon?'  


Load up on a dividend stock that's so high you'd trust it like a spouse, or significant other, or soulmate, or best battle buddy, and then pop the cork to that five years old bottle of Merlot, or your favorite beer, or that bottom shelf Vodka, Gin, or Rum, that you mix with some Cranberry, or Pineapple juice and Coconut shreds, and Coconut juice.  


Then, wake up the next morning, and Google your Rambo dividend stock, which you'll notice doesn't cliffhang, doesn't Airborne Ranger parachutte outta  a C-130, and allows you to sleep at night, like a trusty Rottie, Pitt, German Sheperd, or Dobberman.

To reduce your risk it can be better not to invest a large lump sum all at once, but drip feed it in, say invest 2k a month over 2 ears. That way if there is a correction in a few months, you don‚Äôt eat a huge loss right up front, but can deploy the rest of the cash to take advantage of it. 

I would personally steer clear of that mutual fund. Those management fees suck up all your alpha.

If you wish to invest 50k into stocks, atleast invest 10k across each stock. Less than 5 stocks is a big risk. Ideally you should invest 50k across 10 stocks but i have already determined that you would not do that.

Also no way you can be assured of guaranteed returns even if you invest in the best companies of today. Yes its likely you will get good returns but there is no such thing as a guarantee in stock market.

Also, in my opinion you can look to invest 25k into US stocks and 25k into another country preferably a developing economy like India, Brazil, Singapore, or even a developed country like Japan via a mutual fund because I believe these countries will show better growth than US in future."

The best answer lies in all of these to be honest. 
Have an index fund.

2021-07-01 19:34:33,stocks,"Goog, ms, azn

I only threw MS in there as it seemed like you wanted some financial exposure. If you're flexible ditching a financial I would put nvda back in there. However MS does have a really attractive dividend.

The reason I like AZN is because it is a very stable healthcare company with a diverse line of breakthrough medicines and it has a decent dividend.

With a long-term timeline, dividend investments will be huge, especially if it's money that you don't need.

However this is only based on your original outline of picking 3 stocks. With 50k to work with I would recommend diversifying a little more-- putting 30-40k in those three, then with the remainder spread it out among some more speculative (not AMC or GME) names. Since you are still pretty young a small investment in a potential high growth name like ASAN, TLRY, ZNGA, or RBLX could potentially yield significant gains."

2021-07-01 13:36:57,stocks,">VOO/VTI

Agreed with this comment, will just add some color and my own 2 cents:

* **VOO** is S&P, so you get 500 biggest companies in the US
* **VTI** is broad based US so you get those 500 biggest plus the remaining \~3,000 companies in the US. This is about as close to holding the entire US equity market as it gets.
* **VT** is one I would add. It's like having VTI above plus the rest of the world. This is about as close to holding the entire *world* equity market as it gets (US 55%, Rest of World 45%).

If it was me, I'd go VT and chill."
2021-07-01 10:23:51,stocks,ETF would be ideal if you wanna forget about it. Individual tech stocks are affected more heavily by market crashes than the general S&P 500.
2021-07-01 15:05:42,stocks,VOO has been killing it for me for about 2 years. Highly recommend.
2021-07-01 12:16:23,stocks,This is the answer. Let the professionals at Vanguard handle your long-term investments unless you really know what you're doing (you don't).

Open a portfolio of ETFs.. some based in future tech if possible.. and keep 5% in BTC lol"
2021-07-01 07:32:24,stocks,"I completely agree with this. There are any number of ETFs that will generate more stable returns than individual stocks. I‚Äôd also recommend diversifying more. You‚Äôve selected 3 stocks, 2 of which are in the tech sector.  That puts your money at significant risk in the event of a downturn in a specific sector. 

I‚Äôm on mobile right now and can‚Äôt find the link, but there are any number of calculators that will break down recommended asset allocation (large cap, small cap, emerging markets, bonds, etc.) for a given age, risk tolerance, and retirement target. Check one of those out, then do some research on ETFs. I personally use Vanguard for my retirement vehicles, but there‚Äôs lots of other good ones out there."
2021-07-01 07:59:19,stocks,"I'll just add to this since it's the top comment. 

On top of 2.5% being way too high, it's also not tax deductible. The fee you would pay a broker to trade for you would be less and would be tax deductible. 

If you are looking to get into some stocks, aside from ETF's you should be dealing with an advisor who works for an independent firm. This means they do not have any of their own proprietary products."

2021-07-01 04:55:09,stocks,What is this ridiculous idea that people have that it‚Äôs smart to put your entire investing portfolio into the stock market? That is not a good idea at all and up until recently no one thought this way. Ironically at the times where the stock market is in the most danger (times like now) people feel the most confident in putting their entire net worth into it.

But that's a good point. More general advice would be to first use the money to pay off any high interest debts and maintain an appropriate cash emergency fund.

Another comment mentioned use of a Roth IRA. Another good idea to consider where the money will be invested relative to tax liability and accessibility as needed.

Finally your point about appropriate distribution. Again, not enough details were communicated to really comment on OP's situation. Based on age,  a stock heavy portfolio isn't a terrible idea, but it is worthwhile to review different investment classes, including associated returns/risks, and decide on the approach right for you."

MSFT was barely down in that tech sell off. 2. Cap gains and re investment risk. there is always a risk that i sell a winner with huge cap gains tax and invest into a new stock that may not pan out. 3. I tend to let my winners run for long time. excessive trading is what kills most retail investors.

AMD specialises in gaming, data centres, cloud computing and they‚Äôre at the cutting edge of semiconductor technology with their 5nm Zen 4 Ryzen and EPYC CPUs not too far off in the horizon.

TSM are a good choice because they are the fabrication(or fab) making the semiconductors not just for AMD but for a lot of fabless companies including NVDIA, QQOM and Intel.

2021-07-01 00:07:06,stocks,"Based on the sentiment of mainstream media and people who don‚Äôt care to do research on them yes game-stop seems to be incapable of making big money moves but you are wrong.  This company cleared all debt, raised 1.8 billion after share offerings, have a better than expected quarter, replaced George Sherman with Matt furlong as CEO, who was an amazon director, and the purchase of a giant warehouse that well obviously means they are serious about being an online retailer like amazon and dominating the tech market.  They have expanded from just selling games to selling digital games(meaning it‚Äôs not gonna aim to be a brick and mortar store like many believe), computer hardware (some prebuilt but you could build a pc out of GameStop‚Äôs store), and candy? The most intriguing part is there interest in developing an nft market that is expected to be revealed on July 14th.  I‚Äôm only speculating here but should they develop nfts for cosmetic items and digital copies of games it leads to a huge online resale market.  When you buy a copy of a game from GameStop digitally it will I assume Carey an nft key that will identify it as the exact copy purchased by you but what if you wanted to buy a copy that was played by snoop dog and could be proven by its nft key.  Also imagine being able to trade cosmetics with nfts so you could trade your basic loot box reward for your friends ultra rare armor piece or whatever.  Imagine GameStop hosting auctions for nfts? That‚Äôs very plausible and something I have no doubt they can pull of with all the digital centric experts on the GameStop team.  I am also excited about their interest in streaming.  Twitch at this point is soft core porn so they could definitely make a platform focused on gaming and well if they need to acquire big names like dr. Disrespect or ninja I mean they have the cash to do so."

I think GameStop is going to revolutionize digital gaming. Currently if you buy a game digital, it's done deal. No re-selling, trading, giving your game to a friend, relative. GameStop has dropped hints that they are entering nft space. If games were sold with an NFT backing it? Or you could create an NFT character that can travel thru all gaming worlds. The possibilities are endless, I believe the team involved is going to create things I could never have imagined.

This is going to sound ridiculous (on the overlooked part)... but AMZN.  It's still trading at prices you could've had in August of '20.  

This price after ridiculously great earnings reports & their continuous reinvestments into future ventures is kind of mind boggling.  

Personally, I've recently sold a bit of my AAPL holdings (which Buffett himself called the 'perfect company') to increase my AMZN holdings.  I believe in the latter-half performance/redemption that much."

I have 75500 to invest into a TFSA.  I was thinking of putting it all into VFV.TO.  This is long term.  Would you suggest I put it all into this ETF or should I spread it around in a few.  Also is there a point in scaling in or just all in buy?"

Although people will tell you it is statistically better on average to put it in all at once this is not correct. An individual is subject to unfavorable market fluctuations shortly after they buy. If you have a 10 year time frame take about 20% of the time to average in, hold and 20% of the time to average out. That would be 2 years averaging in, hold, the last 2 years to average out. It's like insurance, it might cost you a little in missed returns but it might save you a lot. If the market happens to crash then throw it all in.

2021-06-30 22:13:07,stocks,"Ok let me run an example and you tell me if i'm right.  I have never wrote call options before.

If it jumps up say $10, my shares are taken away at what I paid for them and i keep the money for the contracts $725.

You can get 500+ shares

If shares hit $148, you get paid $148 per share.  An $11 per share increase in 10 days going with July 9 expiry.  $5,100 in 10 days. Now you can do same thing except take that your starting with 80,000

If price goes to $158, you get $148 and the gambler gets the stock at a great price. 

Pick a strike price you would be happy with, and a stock you would be happy keeping long term 

TFSA is all tax free

Do this for a few months, $$600 per month for 24 months.  Adds up. Plus you still have the stock, which hopefully is growing.

# Overview

""Builders FirstSource is the largest U.S supplier of building products, prefabricated components, and value-added services to the professional market segment for new residential construction and repair and remodelling. We provide customers with an integrated homebuilding solution, offering manufacturing, supply, delivery and installation of a full range of structural and related building products. There are 550 locations across 40 states."" ( [Builders FirstSource | Building Supplies & Materials (bldr.com)](https://www.bldr.com/) )

Market Cap = $8.83B

Sector =  Producer Manufacturing

Net Sales (9/30) = $12.8B

Their most recent press release (06/29)  on the acquisition of  WTS Paradigm, LLC shows that the company is still interested in expanding and improving on their business model.  ([https://investors.bldr.com/node/15296/pdf](https://investors.bldr.com/node/15296/pdf))

&#x200B;

# Fundamentals

The last time the stock did not meet earnings expectations was on the 4th of August in 2016, but since then all the company has been exceeding expectations.

The stock has a P/E of 12.52 ( [BLDR Builders FirstSource, Inc. Stock Quote - finviz.com](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BLDR&ty=c&p=d&b=1) ). However, the average P/E ratio of the  building materials sector is 28.19 and this is expected to increase by 15.28% in the upcoming five years ( [Price Earnings Ratios (nyu.edu)](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html) ). This would signal that the stock is undervalued according to the sector's average... which is also expected to grow.

The current profitability levels for the company are sitting at: +6.35 for the present operating margin and +25.11 for the gross margin.  It has an EPS of 3.40.

The net margin for Builders FirstSource Inc. stands at +3.66. The total capital return value is set at 19.88, while invested capital returns managed to touch 11.81. Equity return is now at value 23.70, with 9.00 for asset returns.

Based on Builders FirstSource Inc. (BLDR), the company‚Äôs capital structure generated 165.26 points at debt to equity in total, while total debt to capital is 62.30. Total debt to assets is 45.65, with long-term debt to equity ratio resting at 157.54. Finally, the long-term debt to capital ratio is 59.39.

&#x200B;

# Technicals

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/0q5DNdQB/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/0q5DNdQB/)

* The stock is sitting 2.55% above the 200 SMA. The last time that contact was made with the 200 SMA was in July 2020.
* The RSI is at 41 and the Laguerre RSI is sitting at 10.
* The price is sitting near the 1.61 Fib retracement level that is acting as support. T
* The stock is labelled as a strong buy by analysts too. Following the recent drop, this would be one of the fairer moments recently to accumulate shares.
* It has a 65-day average volume of 3.02M

&#x200B;

# Risks

The company is witnessing inflation related to raw materials. During January and February 2021, commodity costs grew to its all-time high. The company is encountering supply-related challenges with respect to some of the products including OSB, plywood, lumber and particleboard, thereby leading to the price hike.

Although the demand for single-family residential housing remained very high, the company faced troubles meeting those demands due to labour and material-availability constraints.

The company witnessed volatility in the lumber market throughout 2020. Being a nationwide supplier of building material, the company is very susceptible to fluctuations in market prices for such commodities.

So yes nominal stock prices would rise, but you still wind up poorer as a practical matter. Inflation eats up those 100% paper gains, and the government will be collecting tax on those gains even though you are no better off.

In addition hyperinflation is damaging to companies. Uncertainty, difficulty financing, needs for greater working capital, among other things does real economic damage to companies so not only are you paying taxes on a 100% gain that isn‚Äôt really a gain at all, the companies you own are also worth less.

It‚Äôs just an ugly situation nobody wants. All you can really say is that holding stock is much better than holding cash which is about the worst thing you can have."

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs likely, but we are coming out of decades of super low inflation, which probably has a lot to do with deflation in consumer good prices from China. Right now, even moderate inflation is jarring to a country used to no inflation. If it sticks around,‚Ä¶. Buy silver and gold."
2021-06-30 23:28:08,stocks,"True hyperinflation affects different assets differently. If you think that your paycheck will buy alot less, you will tend to only buy the necessities. So, food and energy see the biggest price increases. Stocks will probably increase, but goods and services will increase more. So, in real terms, value of stocks will decrease compared to goods and services."

2021-07-01 04:06:14,stocks,"You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what determines stock price that is fairly common in the current market I would say.  

Stock price is based on earnings.  It is not intrinsic value that is inflation hedged.  Most stocks do not increase earnings with inflation dollar for dollar.  Even if they did, there are many factors including revenue, costs, risk premium that all are going to change with inflation.   The last one I mentioned is the most important.  As when there is sustained inflation, the expected return will absolutely rise, and this will always bring stock price down.   So not only do stocks have to match inflation dollar for dollar, they actually have to beat it on a percentage basis in terms of ROI in order to break even in an inflationary environment."
2021-07-01 14:45:35,stocks,"I am interested in the real answer to this too. It is my understanding that hiking interest rates is impossible due to the already astronomical government debt, meaning there is no ammunition against high inflation. Since the money expansion continues in order to inflate their way out of the debt while pumping the economy, it could really only mean inflation in the short to medium term. This translates to stocks and real estate being smart holds unless I am missing something critical."

So yes, they will. But we won't see hyperinflation. We wouldn't see hyperinflation even if the government printed the $30T we owe tomorrow. The stock market would 10x and so would houses, consumer goods would slowly catch up, but it wouldn't be barrels of money for a loaf of bread.

2021-07-01 12:20:22,stocks,"For most of us real inflation was well before our time. To have been in the market when we had the last one you would have to be in your mid 60‚Äôs. The only asset class that did well was energy. That in turn has a couple issues 

1. The conditions in the 70‚Äôs had some extenuating factors unrelated to inflation that made energy attractive

2. there are specific trends today related to renewables that make energy less attractive.

I don‚Äôt have much that acts as a good inflation hedge, but I do own LIFZF which is a Canadian iron ore royalty trust. The attraction there is as iron prices rise so do your payments, but company expenses don‚Äôt tend to rise in tandem so you don‚Äôt have the negative effects of inflation on employee wages, working capital etc.

I would be buying energy royalty trusts as a hedge except there is that big picture trend of moving away from oil and natural gas. 

There really isn‚Äôt a good answer here other than to stay away from cash if you really think hyperinflation is coming. The problem is asset valuations are at nosebleed levels so if we don‚Äôt get hyperinflation you risk a crash to more reasonable prices.

Pick your poison."
2021-06-30 20:18:17,stocks,"So imagine you have something like European Union except is more close and everything is kinda regulated. This much production goes here that much production goes there. The countries in USSR ( Soviet Union or how ever u call it) is like a brick wall. And in one moment u start taking out bricks from that wall and in one moment the system collapse. I ain‚Äôt a pro Soviet Union. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. My parrents were ok. They were the ppl who got green cards straight after the collapse of the Soviet Union so we were kinda ok. But all the rest were boom nothing. Imagine a factory that produces tomatoes. This factory sells to 5 countries tomatoes. The factory has 1000 employees. There is no private sector. Everything is government sector. In one moment a union collapse and every country is for itself. You can‚Äôt find investors. You can‚Äôt pay salaries because u don‚Äôt sell the products because no one works for free. The country starts printing more and more money and etc. And from there u get the inflation. After that is hyperinflation. Then there is bankruptcy. I remember just gonna give u the example of bulgarian currency fliped in us dollars. Today the bread costs $0.45 tomorrow becomes $1 after 5 days $10 after thar they change the banknotes from 1 5 10 20 50 100 to 1000 5000 100000 20000 100 k. And one bread becomes 1000. Prices continue growing( now its private sector) money continue getting zeros on the back in one moment. The country decides to take a huge loan for 30 yrs. sell all government properties ( factories) to private foreign investors who actually bankrupts them for loans. From there you get the unemployment cause there is no where to work and then the loan which the country took makes to cover the major sectors. At this time 1 years passed. The government already agrees on deals to open borders with other countries. Usa comes gives a shit plan which will not work but same time gives green cards like french fries and gets the ppl they need for projects they didn‚Äôt knew ( don‚Äôt get me wrong things which the west didn‚Äôt knew the east knew and the opposite). Ppl start going abroad sending money to their parrents. Usa Canada and etc were in the fastest economical growth( 90s). Salaries were huge for those ppl. $1 was equal to 5 bglev. ( now $1 is equal to 1.50 bglev) u get the country joining EU. nato. U don‚Äôt need to feed 180 k army of ppl cause u are in NATO and EU so u reduce it to i think 10 k now. Most of barracks are shut. No government production. Everything is privatised. So businesses starts moving. That‚Äôs the experience of hyperinflation. In American way is never gonna happen. Similiar like ours was the british economy crash i think in the 70s when two ppl split a job per week or something. My history memories about their crash is blurry. I studied but wasn‚Äôt the same. U see u have one thing called federal bank. Guys your currency is leading currency ( at least another 20-30 yrs). U say ( your government‚Äôs ) say INFLATION HYPERINFLATION... and in the end they print more money stability for5-10 yrs and yet another crash and another debt and another printing... etc etc. Usa had hyperinflation but non of us were born. The population was way smaller. Organise crime was bigger.. so listen when USA says hyperinflation i just smile üòÄ and say... yeah... 4% hyperinflation. Google hyperinflation eastern europe and u will understand. Also forgot to mention PRIVATE BANKS was the buggest issue because the central bank of Bulgaria guarantee those loans from the private banks that took the money from european banks and world bank and they just withdrew the banks and bankrupted... i remember the number till today first 500 and later 2000 PERCENT
Now we are still the poorest EU member ( if North Macedonia joins EU they will be the poorest üòÄ) but we are one of the biggest outsourcing countries in IT and Finances after Check Republic for Europe.

I found a trend. I tested it out. It actually worked out well for me several times now. But it‚Äôs a really difficult strategy to execute.

My theory was that you can identify a good entry point in a stock based on a negative change in online sentiment which is NOT correlated to company news and updates or market performance etc.

I believed that if the online sentiment changed to a negative one overall without there being an underlying reason, that it was a good sign that people shorting the stock were anxious to keep the price down and others were bashing it online to get a better entry point.

My theory is that the bashing behaviour doesn‚Äôt occur at random. It occurs strategically.

If people know the share price is going to go up in the mid term and want to keep it quiet to get a better entry point there are going to be some people who attack the stock online to try to bring the price down to give themselves more time for a lower buy in point.

If people have been shorting a stock and need time to exit their positions as they are anticipating a rise in share price they will be inclined to do the same as well.

So, in a way, online stock bashing could be seen as an inverse indicator of the current overall expectations of the actual future share price.

Here‚Äôs how the strategy works. Use websites that provide indicators of stock sentiment on social media. Pick out companies which have recently had strong negative sentiment. Figure out if there is a valid reason for the change in sentiment based on publicly available information about the company.

If nothing has changed in the companys underlying performance and they were in an uptrend before the negative sentiment began, begin to investigate the nature of the online sentiment.

Go on Reddit, Stocktwits or Twitter and actually read through all the comments you can find. Check to see whether or not the negative comments are baseless.

If the sentiment of the stock online is negative for a good reason, such as anticipating a logical negative outcome, then stay away.

If the comments bashing the stock are baseless and can‚Äôt be backed up by logic, fact or reasonable predictions then you probably have a winner.

Unfortunately this strategy can be stressful. You have to read a lot of negativity. You have to think critically and have extensive knowledge of how the market and businesses work. You have to be able to discern bullshit and emotional statements from logic. You have to be able to tell the difference between genuine criticism of a company‚Äôs performance and false criticism which can sound logical but often skews the facts to try to generate a negative view of the company. But those types of statements won‚Äôt stand up to solid research on the company.

If a stock is being heavily attacked online using flawed logic and emotional statements and there are no red flags about the company other than a recent change in share price caused by the above bashing and trolling behaviours then you probably have a good buy in point as the stock will now have an unfair lower price point caused exclusively by bashers.

If you strongly believe this is the case and there is no discernible grey area after solid investigation, just buy the stock. Ignore websites that give price targets as those are always generated based on existing numbers including the dips caused by bashing.

You have to be willing to hold until the bashing behaviour subsides or until the company‚Äôs performance proves them wrong. Once it does and investor sentiment returns to the norm you will gain by the artificial price suppression being lifted. In addition, companies being bashed like this usually have something going for them so you can capitalize on their progress at the same time.

I guess you could say this strategy basically takes advantage of trolls and bashers and uses the price suppression resulting from their online behaviour as leverage to amplify your gains."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,stocks,"100% of school buses could be electric within 15 years: Lion Electric VP Add the funding from the ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù bill and the buses should start rolling!

Electric school buses may be the next wave of EVs to hit the commercial market, one executive within the industry says.
Patrick Gervais, Lion Electric (LEV) VP of marketing and communication, discussed the progress made with electric vehicles on a Yahoo Finance Live segment Tuesday afternoon.
‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a really good intention to electrify 100% of school buses within the next couple of years,‚Äù Gervais said. ‚ÄúWe could feel the hype all across the United States. I mean, we‚Äôve delivered buses in New York, in Minnesota, all across the country.‚Äù
The infrastructure bill, which is supported by President Biden, is expected to provide an additional $15 billion to electric vehicles infrastructure. Under the framework of the bill,  $7.5 billion is to be allocated to schools and public transit organizations to help convert to electric buses.
Gervais noted that a transition to electric school buses would have a plethora of benefits besides a reduction in carbon emissions. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no noise pollution, so it‚Äôs more quiet and the kids are more calm and more concentrated when they go to school,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese are the kids and the people of tomorrow [who] will drive electric cars in the future.‚Äù
Currently, less than 1% of school buses are electric. Over 400,000 school buses drive over 3.5 billion miles each year, according to a Bellwether Education Partners study. The transition to electric buses will take initiative, but with the right moves, Gervais said, the entirety of the US school bus fleet could be electrified in 10-15 years.
Abroad, electric vehicles have sparked the interest of consumers of late ‚Äî 11% of the 11.6 million new cars registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and Britain last year were either fully electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Meanwhile, EVs and plug-ins accounted for less than 3% of new car sales in the United States.

2021-06-30 23:04:29,stocks,"There's really 2 questions here to determine the timeline.

1) How long does a school bus typically last before it needs replaced?

2) How long will it take for battery tech to improve & come down in cost enough to make it economically viable (by 'economically viable' lets say equal in purchase price to an ICE school bus without government subsidies)

While I'm very bullish on EV's and how fast the tech will kill off ICE vehicles in the new vehicle market due to pure economic reasons (imo EV's will be the majority of new vehicle sales by 2025, or 2026 at the very latest), I think 10 years is too aggressive a target to replace ALL school buses on the road. To be honest I think 15 years may be a stretch for 100% of the school buses to be replaced as well. Buying a new fleet of school buses is expensive, it makes sense to try to stretch the life of ICE ones as long as you can. Not to mention we're only just now getting the first BEV semi and pickup trucks on the road, so chances are there's going to be next to zero EV adoption of school buses in the next year or two."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, June 30, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 30, 2021**

*Please Note: Apologies for not sending the Daily Recap out yesterday, I was having technical issues on my end. Thankfully, all the issues were resolved, it's full steam ahead.*

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after hitting record highs for many consecutives days. In short, stocks continue to hover near record highs. Market participants are encouraged a stronger-than-expected gain on private payrolls and tempered inflationary fears. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Q2 earnings season and incoming economic data. 

Today, ADP‚Äôs June private payroll report showed private payrolls increased faster than expected[.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adp-june-private-payrolls-jobs-market-pandemic-economy-recovery-121542029.html) This underscores the ongoing economic recovery with the US economy reporting its sixth straight monthly increase in employment. Job openings rose by 692,000 versus the 600,000 expected. Consumer confidence has also risen and pointed to Americans' increased propensity to spend, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index racing to its highest level since February 2020. 

David Lefkowitz, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Equities, said ‚ÄúIf you look at what's really been powering the economy and powering the stock market, it's been the fact that there's been so much fiscal stimulus poured into the economy. What's really crucial though is that a lot of that fiscal stimulus has actually not been spent this year. It's sitting on the balance sheets of consumers."" I totally agree. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. Now that the economy is reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, I expect saving-laden consumers to step out and spend big this summer after enduring social distancing guidelines for more than a year. 

Today marks the last trading session of the second quarter of the year, so I thought it would be useful to take a look back at the performance of different assets since March. Year-to-date through Tuesday's close, the S&P 500 has increased 14.3%, the Nasdaq by 12.7% and the Dow by 12%. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a year-to-date peak of 1.77% in March but is on track to end the quarter yielding just under 1.5%. The West Texas intermediate crude oil rebounded by 23% as demand for energy picks up. Digital currencies, on the other hand, had a very difficult quarter, with prices sharply down across the board compared to the beginning of the quarter. 

**Highlights**

* Pending home sales were up 8% in May month-on-month, helping reverse April's 4.4% drop, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. This brought the pending home sales index to 114.7, or the highest reading for the month of May since 2005. 
* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi (DIDI) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company sold 316.8 million shares to raise $4.4 billion, making it one of the largest initial public offerings of a Chinese company in the U.S. since Alibaba's (BABA) $25 billion listing in 2014. Trading began trading at $18, roughly 29% higher than its $14 IPO price, though throughout the session the stock lost most of its IPO gains. 
* General Mills (GIS) said it is raising prices across nearly all its grocery categories by around 7% due to higher costs for ingredients and labor. 
* Ford Motor (F) said it will be forced to cut output across more than a half-dozen U.S. factories in July due to continued pressure from the global shortage in semiconductors.
* PayPal (PYPL) is intensifying competition with Square (SQ) by launching its own physical card reader to put in stores. While both are undisputed leaders in fin-tech, PYPL has always focused more intensely on peer-to-peer transactions while SQ put more of an emphasis on consumer-to-business transactions.
* Twitter Inc on Tuesday named Sarah Personette as chief customer officer to oversee the social media platform's global ad sales, global content partnerships and revenue operations. The company has been making a big push to increase revenue lately. 
* **\*\*Current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***
* Salesforce (CRM) target raised by Evercore from $290 to $300 at Outperform. Stock currently around $244
* Crowdstrike (CRWD) target raised by Truist Securities from $250 to $300 at Buy. Stock currently around $252
* Facebook (FB) target raised by Argus from $385 to $410 at Buy. Stock currently around $349
* Hess (HESS) target raised by Wells Fargo from $98 to $104 at Overweight. Stock currently around $87.50
* Paychex (PAYX) target raised by Citigroup from $1095 to $121 at Buy. Stock currently around $107
* Shopify (SHOP) with two target raises. Stock currently around $1464
   * Loop Capital from $1400 to $1600 at Buy
   * Royal Bank of Canada from $1500 to $1700 at Outperform
* Exxon Mobil (XOM) target raised by Wells Fargo from $67 to $72 at Overweight. Stock currently around $63

2021-07-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Would it be better to automate or manually select the securities in my Roth IRA portfolio? Title. I threw this on the PF sub but wanted to ask your thoughts here, too.

I'm 18 and banking with Wells Fargo - my money has a lot of time to sit. Because of that, I suppose I'd be more comfortable with risk, but sometimes I get FOMO: maybe I'll miss out on a better ETF, stock, etc. that an algorithm would have picked up on. (As for indexes, I don't have the kind of money to buy more than 4 shares of S&P directly lol. I was more so contemplating and comparing all the ETFs that track an index/mutual funds, for example. And obviously there are so many of those.)

I also have the option to mix automation and manual trading and delegate a certain amount of money to each type of trading per year. What to do?"
2021-06-30 21:28:44,stocks,"Automating your investments generally means paying a fee. You are probably better off just buying some vanguard etfs, chances are that's what the algorithm will do and it will probably also do some rebalancing for you periodically. Which you can also do yourself. Check https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/list#/etf/asset-class/month-end-returns

I would probably just dump the $5k into their dividend ETF since this is a Roth account or their S&P 500 ETF."

2021-06-30 23:09:07,stocks,"When you mean automate you mean they select your portfolio for you and just set it on auto buy once a month? If I was talking to 18 year old me, I‚Äôd say select an etf that is diversified and aggressive growth with high quality companies. Set it on auto buy appropriate for your income. Not sure what etfs you have access to but I use fidelity and love their blue chip growth fund and contra fund in my retirement accounts. Pretty sure there are etf versions of those. Good luck!

2021-06-30 21:56:04,stocks,USA and tech heavy but not unreasonable
2021-07-01 00:00:00,stocks,"What's up with IPOs and how did I shoot myself in the foot? Ok, so, I only started actively investing in April of this year and only $25 a paycheck, because you know, don't invest more than you can stand to lose. I check the Nasdaq's IPO calendar every so often and saw LegalZoom just waiting to be picked up today. I'm not very analytical in my approach to stocks at the moment because there is so much to learn/know, and even then it's a bit of a crap shoot.

So, I saw LZ on robinhood this morning with a price of $28.00. I put a limit order in at 9AM for a few shares at $28.00 because it wasn't actively being traded yet. So I check in a short time ago to look at something else and see that the order wasn't executed and the price jumped to roughly $36.

Can someone kindly explain to me what happened? If the initial price listed was $28.00, then why wasn't it executed at $28 when it was open for trade?"
2021-06-30 20:09:34,stocks,IPO - It's probably overpriced
2021-06-30 21:51:52,stocks,"$28 was the IPO price--The price that LZ sold their shares to the institutions and accredited investors (usually over $1MM liquid net worth).

Once trading started, those institutions and accredited investors can sell their shares at any price they want.  Unsurprisingly, they were only willing to sell the shares at a much higher price, as noted in this CNBC article:*""The stock opened at $36.75 per share after an initial public offering price of $28 each.""*

To get access, you'd need to have a (large) account at one of the IPO underwriters/IBs  or maybe a broker (Fidelity, Schwab, etc) who may have shares allocated to them.

*(Also from CNBC: ""There were 14 underwriters, led by J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Barclays."")*"
2021-06-30 22:33:10,stocks,Change it GTC if you want it at that price.  It will fill in the next few weeks probably.
2021-06-30 23:41:54,stocks,"Only certain people get to trade an IPO for an hour or two before it opens on the market. The price can go up a lot in that time and pop even more when it opens to the public for the first day or week. You should almost never buy an IPO on the first day even if you have super confidence in the company and especially if you don't have additional cash to average down when it inevitably drops.
You didn't shoot yourself in the foot, you dodged a loss."
2021-07-01 13:05:16,stocks,You can now with PSTH.
2021-07-01 00:56:44,stocks,This is your answer.
2021-06-30 21:43:39,stocks,"When you see a price on a stock that only means it's the last price it was traded at or depending on the broker some other form, in case of an IPO it's what was determined from get go. That doesn't mean jackshit though as it reflects the past or a more or less made up reality (like bids+ask/2). 

If you see a stock that shows a price of 100$ and you buy 20 shares you will pay whatever another person is willing to sell for, and using a limit order mitigates risk. In theory on a market order and only 1 other person selling, you will pay whatever he puts up. So if that's 1k per share you pay 1k per share. Then the price will jump up to 1k instantly and trigger a lot of take profits that have no limit alongside them. Those will attempt to instantly sell due to this but since they are market sells the highest buyer will be chosen, meaning as the price was 100$ it will be below 100 (well, at least likely) and jump down.

Same reason why the entire squeeze story is to a big part made up. They make people believe when it shows 5k on a stock you get 5k. On a liquid market that's also likely, but not on an event that's so out of line and has only a single buyer."
2021-06-30 21:58:18,stocks,I think there‚Äôs a good spot to buy the dip if it‚Äôs a business you know enough about and not a cash grab like Krispy Kreme. Otherwise totally agree here.

\- compare my portfolio performance to broad indexes but take into account when and at what price I purchased stocks."

2021-07-01 00:00:00,stocks,"21 decisions to sell, got almost all of them wrong I've always suspected that one of the most costly mistakes I've made when investing has been selling prematurely, but I never dug through my data to determine if that was actually true.  So I decided to do that.  I went back over 21 separate decisions I've made to sell stocks over the past 12-18 months to see what happened in the months after the sales.

None of these were short-term trades, they were all intended to be long-term investments when I bought them but ended up deciding to sell.  Sometimes it was based on technical signals (new downtrends, violation of the 50 day moving average, price running up too fast and getting over-extended beyond the 50 DMA) but other times it was based on concerns about valuation.  Sometimes it was pure impatience, getting frustrated with a stock going nowhere and wanting to find a better opportunity.

Out of the 21 sell decisions, 18 of them turned out to be wrong in the sense that the price ended up higher than my sell price within the ensuing weeks and months.  In only 3 of the 21 cases did the decision to sell turn out to be a good one.  But the important thing is what I can learn from this to improve my decisions in the future.  Here are some observations:

1) A break below the 50 day moving average is a very unreliable sell signal, especially if the stock remains in a longer term uptrend.  Price dropping below the 50 DMA theoretically signals a change in the medium term trend, which could foretell the beginning of a longer term downtrend.  But in almost every case where I sold after the stock dropped below the 50 DMA, it reversed course within days and continued up.  The only case where this turned out to be a good signal was when the stock traded below the 50 DMA for several weeks.

2) Don't sell stocks based on concern about valuation.  Valuing stocks isn't an exact science; I'm not a professional and even professionals can have very different opinions about the fair value of a stock.  In every single case where I sold because I thought the stock got ""overvalued,"" it continued climbing.  This is where some of my biggest mistakes happened in terms of lost profits.  For example, I sold APPS last October for a 6x return at $32 only to watch it hit $100 within 5 months.

3) Selling when the stock dropped was always a mistake.  This overlaps with (1) because the drops typically coincided with a technical signal (breaking below the 50 DMA or breaking a support level), but every time that happened the stock reversed course soon after.  Unless the selloff reflects an underlying change in the long-term prospects for the business, you should be taking advantage of drops to buy not sell.

To be fair to myself, some of these decisions could have turned out to be correct if I moved the money elsewhere and saw better returns than if I had left the money where it was.  But the results clearly show that premature selling is a costly mistake."

2021-07-01 03:26:32,stocks,"Yesterday I found a virtual portfolio of my stocks from 2017 that was virtual but mimick/copy the exact real portfolio I had on IB. 

I was shocked.

I sold S&p at 2900 thinking it was at an ath and would never cross 3000.

I sold Nvidia at 160 after the 40% drop it had for the sales that didnt match expectation

I sold Plus500 at a - 40% for accounting fraud  when now it has fully recovered. 

I sold 60 eth at 300$ thinking they will never get anywhere and they got to 4.200 a few months ago.

It was sad but also eye opening. I picked up great assets, I just had to be more patient and wait a few years. 

The virtual portfolio was still intact and the return was 600%. Sadly it was only virtual as real assets were gone üò≠üò≠. Eth is the one that hurts more. Could have been life changing"

2021-06-30 20:19:16,stocks,"I absolutely agree. In my own experience, selling has almost always tended to be a costly mistake. I bought a stock for a reason. When I bought the stock, it was never with the intention to sell. However, some time later, I almost always forgot the reason why I bought it in the first place and end up selling it and move on to the next shiny object.

I have since written down reminders for myself to only buy things I plan on holding for 10+ years and never sell it unless I have reached that goal."

I bought Ferroglobe (GSM) when it was 2.74 because it seemed a bit too down. #1 in silica and by-products that support battery and solar panel production. #2 was 25. Heavy debt they were paying off and depressed profits by the pandemic. They had a decent amount of cash to float them, a plan they developed, and worked things out. They are currently over 6, and they supply needs for solar energy.

I also bought into jabil (JBL). Used to work for em 10 years ago, so I knew what they do. They developed sanitizing robots, and their stock went from 42 in april to over 55 now."

Blue line is average excess return (over an S&P index fund) 1-8 weeks after I sold  
Red line is average excess return (over an S&P index fund) over the last 8 weeks of stuff I'm still invested in

Limitations:

1. Timelines are different, since I'm looking at the most recent 8 weeks for stuff I'm invested in, and random 8 week periods for stuff I sold over the last couple years
2. Ignoring size of trade.  
3. Ignoring dividends 
4. Outliers can affect average a lot with small sample sizes.

2021-07-01 03:48:13,stocks,"I'd be interested with the results if you added a time dependent parameter to your analysis. For a simplistic example if after a chart dips below the 50-DMA only sell it if after 5 trading days it still remains below for instance. Setting up multiple parameters for selling or buying is a huge hedge against false signals and reversals.

Also in my experience a reversal signaled off of a false signal ends up some of the strongest indicators of price direction in my experience. It's almost exciting to me when a signal has clearly failed because it's been my confident experience this most reliably indicates price will move significantly in the reverse direction more so than any other form of TA analysis."

2021-07-01 08:23:02,stocks,"Sure, but what surprised me was how often it would drop below the 50, sometimes on a very strong move, and then rebound and reclaim it.  I suppose that's a feature of stop-losses and institutions entering orders below the 50 to capitalize on those stop-losses."
2021-07-01 08:31:20,stocks,"If you're an active trader and you're very good at nailing those exit and entry points, sure.  But if you're a long-term investor there's no point in selling if you're just going to buy back in (aside from the tax implications).

I actually did that with APPS, my biggest mistake.  I bought it a while back at 5.09 and watched it run strongly in the early COVID growth move.  I thought it had gotten way overextended and overvalued, so I sold it at \~23 with the plan to buy back in after a pullback.  Well it never pulled back, so I ended up buying back in at \~25 and then sold again later.  I would have been much, much, much better off if I just held the damn thing from the beginning."

2021-06-30 21:29:13,stocks,"Yep, in a bear market you buy stuff and it goes down. You buy more to average down, and it goes down even more. It keeps going down for two or three years. The most beloved stocks with the best potential and the best profits end up dropping by more than 50%.

That's what happened after the dot-com bubble burst, and it's what will happen when the Fed stops printing money. Everyone has become used to every dip being bought up violently in a week. Like the October 2020 correction - the market dropped hard for 2 weeks, and then snapped back and rallied past that point in one week in early November. When the fed stops printing money, those types of super fast snapback rallies will not happen anymore. The money just won't be there."

2021-06-30 22:51:51,stocks,"Yeah it's hard to watch your stocks tank I bought alot of hyped up stocks like NIO for example in JAN-Feb and they all started tanking. In May I decided to put some stop losses on my plays and buy cheaper they all hit my stop around  March 4-7 then everything bounced back I learned a valuable lessen not to worry to much about the ebbs and flows of day to day if you are in good company they can bounce back I decided not to sell my AMD during that period and I'm finally up 10% on it after 6 months. 

Then from April 26th to may 16th alot of my stocks where tanking and I didn't even worry I was down to about 1% gains for the year on the 16th and was feeling pretty bad but I decided not to sell since last time it was disastrous and now I'm up 20% on the year today at close.

It's hard starting out but a good saying I learned from thestockguy he's a streamer I watch is "" if your learn from your mistakes they are investments"" 

I also trade alot more since I'm pretty impatient aswell but I use the 2 account system 1 for degen plays and 1 for long term that  I won't sell till I need the money."
2021-07-01 06:35:41,stocks,"Exactly.  Just because you missed on on potential gains on something you sold doesn't mean you didn't make something, or even more, with what you bought.  I was upset with myself for selling AMD at about $83 and it's almost $94 now, but I made about 70% of that missed gain in what I replaced it with.  On one hand, I'm upset at selling too early, but on the other, I shouldn't be that upset since I still made good money."

2021-07-01 08:46:38,stocks,Wouldn‚Äôt this be the ideal strategy when you‚Äôre worried about a stock being overvalued as you say in your second point. The trailing stop loss would let you pick up on any remaining tailwinds and lock in a profit you were definitely comfortable with.

Absolutely.

A win is a win.  That's what I keep repeating to myself like a mantra.  As soon as I hit my target, I am out.  If it's an option, I don't care if I have another week or two before expiration.  That's just a gift.  I get the gift of time back so my money isn't locked up.  If I think a play still has legs, open a new contract."

If I felt like my decision was good, I bought more on the way down. If things went green, even though I get all cocky about it, I would evaluate my choices from a different perspective, and sometimes sell some to reap the gains, just in case."

Or did something change of which you were not aware (which begs the prior question)?

I invest and I trade.  I am clear on which is which but sometimes my confidence does get tested and I have to check myself.  Sometimes I just take profits and violate my own rules - I‚Äôm human and sometimes want mine now.  Working on getting better at investing but it ain‚Äôt easy."
2021-06-30 20:02:53,stocks,"That's certainly true but we're on reddit here, not some old stockbroker. Here short term is hours or, at best, days. Long term is weeks or, on rare occasions, months.



Many users love to say they'll hold whatever's crashing for ""years"" because they believe in it...only to sell days later. Unless we're talking strictly Bogleheads I'd say holding for months makes OP a long term investor by reddit standards"

2021-07-01 00:11:28,stocks,"It's a big profession, with a lot of different specialties. I got lucky and after working in a large bank trust dept, landed a job with a mid-size RIA so I got to wear a lot of hats and see many sides of the business. I also kept going to school and earned two masters and a CFA, not because anyone forced me, but because I just like learning about this stuff, but I tend to error on the academic side.

Firgure out a niche that you love and just read everything you can get your hands on. Read critically, there's a lot of self-serving BS out there. Read things you disagree with and make sure you're not wrong in what you believe. It's hard to give general advice because there are so many paths you could take.

Finally, as one of my mentors once told me, ""always remember, in this business, if you are right half the time, you are still doing way better than average."""
2021-06-30 22:50:31,stocks,"I don't think that's the right lesson.  

1. If you're selling it and leaving it as cash, it's probably a mistake long term since the market tends to beat cash.

2. If it's just being reinvested in something else, you need to examine opportunity cost.  Odds are you're just exchanging one appreciating asset for another, and the amount you're gaining or losing is just the difference between their ROIs.  

3. You don't ""lose"" when something you sold goes up.  You only lose when something you own goes down."

I currently own 8,000 PAVMZ warrants in my traditional IRA purchased at $0.75 each. Each warrant allows me to purchase one share of PAVM at a price of $1.60; the warrants expire in 2024. From what I can tell, there is no cashless exercise provision.

While I‚Äôm currently enjoying the fact that my warrant purchase has provided me with a 535% return (as of today), I‚Äôm trying to work out my strategy when the warrants are either called by the company or when 2024 arrives, whichever comes first. I am bullish on PAVM. 

Let‚Äôs assume that PAVM goes to $10 a share, and PAVMZ reaches $8.40 at the same time. The way I see it, I can either a) pay the $12,800 to exercise the warrants and ride with 8,000 shares of PAVM stock at $1.60, or b) sell the warrants for $67,200 and buy 6,720 shares of PAVM.

NVDA might be growing for many years, but risk seems getting higher and higher. If it gets ARM, and it isn‚Äôt a top ARM computer/chip provider(Apple would be), the debt (buying ARM) would drag NVDA.
Its GPU for graphics is leading, but graphics GPU alone does not sustain high-flying stock price. Just be cautious!"

Fundamentally competition helps them reduce their capital expenditures, all else equal. And it's not equal right now, AMD chips use less power and are faster. AMD is going to continue to gain share and the recent add of capacity at TSMC will accelerate that.

Sure weather events, or supply disruptions can account for short term grain or lumber price action but my thesis is that inflation is here to stay. The increase in money supply, decrease in money velocity, debt to gdp which ties the feds hands for meaningful rate increases leads me to believe that transitory inflation is wishful thinking."

2021-07-01 07:31:29,stocks,"I don't blame you, the concept of robotic process automation (RPA) is simple but what the technology actually does is not well understood unless you're in the industry. The goal of RPA is to essentially replace human workers that perform repetitive/rule based tasks. Think of office tasks like HR hiring, firing, moving positions, salary increases, etc. 

The concept really is that simple, take a repetitive task and you automated every step that the human did. The automation is quicker, more reliable, and can work 24 hours a day. This is a simple use case, the more complex use case is to use it for interconnecting systems that normally wouldn't talk to each other. My company has found great use in this, for example take software ""X"" that can only output a file to a local directory. That file then has to be uploaded to software ""Y"" which is completely unrelated to X. Previously a human would have to manually upload that file, but now with RPA we can write code to interact with the file system and upload it to the desired portal. You can do this without RPA but you would have to use different technologies and probably a few days worth of work whereas I can do this in minutes with RPA.

One last nugget that not many see, the inherent nature of this RPA technology is to want to utilize it MORE. You want to find more automations because that means more savings. This translates to more licenses and more purchasing of services. Once a customer is hooked on RPA they will never go back and they will continue to look for more automations which translate to more and more sales for the automation company. It's a software that will LITERALLY upsell itself. 

I hope that helps you understand, as I mentioned I think UI Path is a bit overvalued at the moment but consider the only other public company I can think of in the space which is blue prism. I personally believe their technology is superior and will win out in the long run."

2021-06-30 22:24:48,stocks,I wouldn't say endemic in that case. Endemic means that they are native to a location and only live in that location.
2021-07-01 04:21:54,stocks,"I mean, they're certainly aggressive and I see a future for AR. Maybe they're onto something with their strategy.

What I believe, though, is that these things are mostly decided by the first company to figure out *how* to use the technology, not create the technology from scratch. I'm sorry for bringing up Apple again like a broken record, but that's what they do. There's been MP3 players before the iPod, touchscreen devices before the iPhone ([oh boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton)), smart watches before the Apple Watch, wireless headphones before the AirPods... Even Android came out *after* iOS. So I'm not sure what facebook is all about with being ""first"". 

What matters is being the first to pitch a mature hardware product with a viable use case. Meeting my family for dinner isn't one, IMO. I have video communication on my smartphone but I text people, because it's a better form of communication for most cases. 

What I see for AR is actual productivity increases. A literal 3D desktop that lives in your glasses. That's a monumental UX challenge, one that hasn't been figured out yet. And I don't feel like facebook understands this, they're all about locking down their ecosystem and making 3D avatars... I don't think that's what will sell people on AR. I rather see an office environment, something rather dry."

 >The Newton is a series of personal digital assistants (PDAs) developed and marketed by Apple Computer, Inc. An early device in the PDA category (the Newton originated the term), it was the first to feature handwriting recognition. Apple started developing the platform in 1987 and shipped the first devices in August 1993. Production officially ended on February 27, 1998. Newton devices ran on a proprietary operating system, Newton OS; examples include Apple's MessagePad series and the eMate 300, and other companies also released devices running on Newton OS.

2021-07-01 09:33:54,stocks,"I actually do agree it often matters who is first to figure out a use case, but I think quest 2 has that figured out. They sold 5 million of them. They are first to market with a viable use case. Gaming was always how you got the headset in the house. Facebook is likely selling these at a loss so its pretty much a country wide tech demo sponsored by them.

Facebook is pushing hard for industrial use of the headset, I think they see the same thing you do. They've purchased a couple 3d modeling companies recently, likely to work on some sort of construction app. The industry uses for real estate and construction are already being explored. My GF's new apartment had a vr tour for showingns. Eventually theyl be able to take blueprints and reconstruct a house, so you can actually see what a house will look like before its built. FB is throwing every possible use at the wall and seeing what sticks.

Apple doesn't scare me for a couple reasons. First is they are way behind, and don't seem to really care. Second, they don't have the same corporate  vision for the space. I know that in 5 years FB will still be pushing VR heavily and investing in the space. In 5 years Apple might just be doing ai cars, iPhone 35 etc. They have not demonstrated the same commitment."

In fact the *closest to a real shortage* was during the 90s since manual cameras used a notable amount of silver for their film. With digital cameras taking over solve reprice tanked and stayed low for years since the supply has been ridiculous much higher since a major business died more or less over night. Even all modern tech today doesn't use close to as much...and won't for a foreseeable future.




Diversifying is never bad so buy physical in some way and hold, given enough time you'll make a profit. That said silver as a *store of value* is very overrated, as we saw during the Corona-crash. Gold went to the moon and silver went to...a nearby hill. The low value of silver makes it a poor choice, a mere 10k of silver means no less then 11-12kg physical metal.

Second best is letting someone else store it for you, physical backing. You'll pay a small premium for the service but it's the safest and most efficient way for a trader.

2021-06-30 23:34:00,stocks,"I understand, what your getting at is that the ""inefficiencies"" of democratic style governments. 

&#x200B;

There are people who argue that democratic governments are very inefficient and the larger it gets the more the cracks start to show. They argue that having a longer term leader at the top something equivalent to  China or Russia is more efficient because things get done much faster without delay. Instead of arguing over funding this or that, the leader at the top would just make the best decision within days instead of weeks or months. 

&#x200B;

Me personally, I prefer democratic governments because I like that they are slow moving and fair to all the citizens. If you are not careful you have a country like China or Russia or North Korea where just a few at the top benefit and hold unlimited control over every citizen forever.  In the USA we have the concept of freedom and equality. 

 In the long term are democracies the best? Maybe not. They tend to fail miserably.  But for my short lifetime that I spend on earth here, I want to live in a democracy where I can feel like I have a free life (even if it is an illusion)."

A couple of my favorite right now:


RDFN: I think they will remove realtors and the way real estate is bought/sold. I know Z and OPEN is more popular in this category, but having experience with all 3 via real estate investing, I think RDFN is better than the other 2 and is the one undervalued now.

>Corsair had a ridiculous year and only recently went public

Logitech had an even better year. They also have a wider audience in gaming, enterprise and the general public. Corsair is strictly gaming and already have large market shares in the products they sell.

They are also trading at a similar P/E, if Corsair had a 20B market cap their P/E would be insane. The one thing that could justify something like that would be insane growth but they're not even outgrowing Logitech right now and Logitech even offers dividends.

Besides, the eventual return to normal from COVID might affect both companies negatively in the short term.

It's good you have conviction in their future but there is plenty of bear case for Corsair that you should consider. 20B evaluation for Corsair right now would be absolutely outrageous. Imo they are at about fair price right now."

As I said, if you have **equal** conviction. Of **course** they won't perform the same, that's literally the point. You can have equal conviction over all of them but you can still be wrong.

By holding 5 stocks you have 5 stocks than can underperform or even go to 0 by holding 6 stocks now you have 6 stocks that can underperform and/or go to 0, not much of a difference, in fact you just introduced more risk by having an extra stock that can go bad and cripple your portfolio while reducing your potential returns at the same time.

Yes there is no reason. 5 is not much better than 1 the same way than 8 is not better than 5.

>Everyone should pick their single highest conviction stock and dump everything into that right?

No, most people should avoid picking individual stocks and diversify as much as they can because most people are bad at picking stocks. Only people that are good at picking stocks would be better picking their single highest conviction instead of going for 5+."
2021-07-01 19:24:35,stocks,"By extension you are saying there is no risk reduction associated with going from 5-6 but there is one in an etf with a 100 holdings so you are looking at a a graph with an asymptote, sudden jump in risk reduction that seems highly unlikely and contradicts every academic paper i read on the subject most show a symptomatic risk reduction upto 40 holdings, afterwards the risk reduction per additional holding declines and starts aproaching 0 i have a degree in CS so im not unfamilar with math myself."
2021-06-30 21:13:55,stocks,"That's where you're wrong.  Adding a stock definitely helps diversify no matter how small your portfolio is.  Even more, actually.  Adding a stock to a 1 stock portfolio diversifies the portfolio by 100%.  Adding a stock to a 2 stocks portfolio diversifies by 50%.  In OP's examples adding a 6th stock to a 5 stock portfolio diversifies it by 20%.  That's a lot.

Never underestimate the power of diversification.  If one of your holdings goes to zero then it makes a huge difference whether your portfolio is 3 stocks vs 5 stocks."

I'm also holding a bunch of my assets in cash, treasury bonds, commodities and other assets. The idea is that when stocks go down, some of these other assets will go up.

 Thirty-five basis points may not seem like much, but it made a huge difference because of the trillions of dollars involved.""

DNUT debuted today and they had to price it way below the initial estimate of $21-$24/sh."

2021-07-01 13:58:26,stocks,"There are some big missing points within your comments. Ulrich Kranz was never supposed to be CEO and had no experience as a CEO. He was only CEO because Krause stepped down after a lawsuit. It was always temporary.

&#x200B;

To say there are only two reasons a founder would leave is that there is fraud or that they were ousted is just wrong and narrow viewed.

Obviously its pure speculation but did you ever think maybe there is some kind of apple connection with Canoo? (I know unlikely but there have been 2-3 apple connections in the past year and it is a bit strange) Or even more likely - Kranz got Canoo where it needed to be with his skillset and then wanted to move onto something new? The guy has like a million shares in Canoo he obviously still wants the company to be successful.

Dont see why everything has to always automatically be negative...

To be clear, it is entirely possible he was ousted, but to say it with such certainty and no actual facts is not helpful for people looking for quality info. This just sounds like repeats of baseless reddit posts always with no info. Show me where you see a real internal feud that is not someone reading into it."

2021-07-01 10:03:51,stocks,If you see a short squeeze starting to happen you can call and take them off loan or enter a GTC sell order at a really high limit price ($100+).  That puts more pressure on the squeeze but you enjoy the interest payments in the mean time!

2021-07-01 14:18:19,stocks,I did.
2021-07-01 16:49:19,stocks,"It depends if you buy into the naked short and billions of synthetic shares conspiracies.  I call it a conspiracy because there is no definitive evidence of billions of synthetic shares or naked shorting. Numbers in the FTDs and off exchange trading may suggest it, but its hardly evidence that more than the float is shorted by millions or billions of shares.  If it did turn out to be true, then mathmatically, sure...its possible.  But you have so many obstacles in the way that I doubt anyone in retail ever sees that kind of money.  IE when gamestop had its squeeze, all of a sudden clearing house issues and blah blah blah.  

Full disclosure, I hold XXX AMC shares from May and I am hanging onto them because the SI continues to climb and I think it has a potential to see tripple digits in the near term. I will re-evaluate my position if SI drops or it legs up to the 100s."
