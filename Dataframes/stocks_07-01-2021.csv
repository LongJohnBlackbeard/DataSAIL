7/1/2021 19:52,stocks,In the wise words of my old roommate. If you buy that stock you're f*****g that chicken I'm just watching the feathers fly.
7/1/2021 19:41,stocks,"It's worth the investment. If we can pull them away from the clutches of Citadel, thats a win for everyone. The only problem is RH's PR is pretty badly damaged. They're going to forever be known as the GameStop killer. If they take action to repairing that damage, I can see people forgetting about it and using the app again."
7/1/2021 19:47,stocks,You think them getting more money is what will convince them to be ethical?!
7/1/2021 19:50,stocks,Maybe. Maybe not. Businesses do business things. Going public will at least help keep a light on their practices.
7/1/2021 19:28,stocks,Perfect post. D NUT BUY! I am impressed with the brazen bag passing by JAB.
7/1/2021 19:54,stocks,"Okay but if KK offers every shareholder a free donut and announces an offering the day after, I‚Äôm in."

7/1/2021 19:40,stocks,"My grandpa was an early investor in them and made out nice, probably around 20-25 years ago. I read up on them not too long ago because I was curious why they weren‚Äôt public anymore, and it was basically because they tried to expand too quickly and it ruined the company arch. By selling their donuts in grocery stores it became less of a novelty and it‚Äôs kind of just a good brand with not too much upside now. Had no clue they had an IPO til just now lol, but yeah don‚Äôt buy with any high hopes."
7/1/2021 19:45,stocks,I remember these Jokes and scandals.. $10 would be too high in my estimates.. I am waiting for Petsmart and Panera to go public again
7/1/2021 19:26,stocks,But but donuts‚Ä¶

7/1/2021 19:42,stocks,"They need to come out with some new products and expand their menu. Adding food coloring and calling it a seasonal donut is not a new product.

Breakfast sandwiches, sausage & cheese kolache... jesus how about even a basic classic baked cinnamon roll (not their cinnamon donut).

Sticking to ""the classics"" only works when your product doesn't accelerate diabetes in your clients."
7/1/2021 19:40,stocks,I never understood the hype behind Krispy Kreme
7/1/2021 19:39,stocks,I‚Äôd rather buy $DEEZ
7/1/2021 19:48,stocks,Unfortunately i was waiting Capital to list it on UK market cause it was easy 17 to 22 price range money.. and later just wait for the opening for short... i know the donut doesn‚Äôt worth even $5 but hey we are here to make money... unfortunately Capital screw up again... they listed Chinese truck ipo but not donuts üòÄ
7/1/2021 19:50,stocks,Not to mention all the people that are still working from home not buying donuts heading into the office.
7/1/2021 19:32,stocks,Just waiting for their morning veggie and CBD donut to rope in all the malnourished millennials and zoomers.  Maybe they can even make it transgender to drive all the cops away.
7/1/2021 19:58,stocks,"I saw the topic and was like, wasn't Krispy Kreme public at one time.."
7/1/2021 19:33,stocks,Their donuts are trash.
7/1/2021 19:25,stocks,How come I can't buy puts on them? Anyone have issues with this?
7/1/2021 19:59,stocks,It‚Äôs not a legit investment it‚Äôs a meme stock..I bought in today for fun and I am selling at my target
7/1/2021 19:53,stocks,"Or, you wait until they IPO, let the stock tank if that's what you think is going to happen and then you purchase the discounted shares because the reason a legacy company would IPO is because they want to raise capital - why do they want to raise capital? Maybe they have, you know, some kind of business plan that they need some cash for. Maybe the plan will prove to be genius. That's stocks."

7/1/2021 19:40,stocks,But it helps‚Ä¶ if you have plenty of demand for your product you can lower your margins and still be profitable while killing the competition
7/1/2021 19:50,stocks,You can only lower margins if you have them in the first place.
7/1/2021 19:41,stocks,"That only works if you‚Äôre a prudent and fiscally responsible businessman, you could have all the sales in the world and still be broke if you can‚Äôt manage your finances. Same as you could have barely any sales but post record profits if your spending is under control."
7/1/2021 19:49,stocks,Sales are more important than cost control. With good sales you can always get financing and figure out how to control cost later. Just look at how Amazon rose to the top after loosing money for 20 years

How do donuts become anymore cheaper?"
7/1/2021 18:20,stocks,"It's a single trade of 174 volume that settled at 58.63.

7/1/2021 18:00,stocks,Step 1: Reconsider.
7/1/2021 17:43,stocks,Try this question in r/DayTrading
7/1/2021 17:55,stocks,"Learning to read pre-market moves and volume increases is probably one of the more important things about day trading to learn. The thing about your post is that you said ‚Äúdaily swings of $1-$3.‚Äù $1-$3 can be a 20% move for one stock and .5% for another. And you said ‚Äúswing‚Äù obviously knowing it goes both ways. Reliably earning X amount daily in trading is impossibly difficult. To successfully day trade you have to be extremely patient, extremely selective, extremely strict on your bankroll, and extremely ungreedy. Once you master that, you‚Äôll win more than you lose. Before even attempting to day trade I would recommend taking months and years to work on swing trading. If you really want some passive income and have a decent bankroll - selling covered calls is a great start (you really only stand to lose possible gains and realized gain taxes)."
7/1/2021 17:55,stocks,"The larger your account is, the easier it will be to make a profit. If you have $1,000, you‚Äôd need 20% gains every day. $10,000? You‚Äôd need 2% gains every day. Also yes try the r/DayTrading mentioned below.

Edit: these figures are based on the $200 a day target."
7/1/2021 19:15,stocks,"Unless your connected, or have great awareness/ability to track the markets your gonna lose"
7/1/2021 19:08,stocks,Step 2: Don't.
7/1/2021 17:51,stocks,thanks!
7/1/2021 17:24,stocks,Don't look at it
7/1/2021 17:25,stocks,"It comes with time, you get used to red days.  If your money is in quality companies and ETFs...it will grow.  Just not every day, unfortunately."
7/1/2021 17:45,stocks,"Most people are telling you to ignore short-term volatility, and I think they‚Äôre generally right. 

However, if you‚Äôre concerned about your losses so far you may want to reassess your investing strategy. Do you have a process for screening stocks and diving deep into the ones you‚Äôre interested in? Do you have a fair grasp on a company‚Äôs financial statements and can identify trends in their revenue, profit, free cash flow, shares outstanding,  etc.? Do you have a qualitative sense on the future plans of the company and how they‚Äôre executing that over the next few years? 

These are the kind of questions to ask and the subject matter you should be researching before investing in a stock. I‚Äôm not saying you have or haven‚Äôt done these things, but short term losses early in your investing career can be an opportunity to grow and learn more about the stock market. 

As you continue to develop and fine tune your process over time, I think you‚Äôll grow more confident in your portfolio and be willing to endure the short term rumblings of the market."
7/1/2021 17:28,stocks,"You sound young and even if you‚Äôre not, you have many cycles ahead of you. Over the long haul, stocks will outperform all other asset classes more than likely. Trying to time the market is very tough. Try picking back to back exactas at the track. Pick good solid stuff and ride it out. Don‚Äôt get to euphoric when it‚Äôs high or despondent when it‚Äôs low."
7/1/2021 18:04,stocks,IMHO the secret to profit in the stock market is the iron stomach.
7/1/2021 17:46,stocks,Zoom out.. don't look. Think it will come back up eventually! I hope..or else we have bigger problems.
7/1/2021 18:42,stocks,"gets easier with time. after what i went thru past 5 yrs in investing, mild sell offs here and there dont bother me one bit. 

huge sell off end of 2018, then another one in 2019, then the covid crash in 2020, and we just had another monster tech sell off last month due to that ""inflation scare""

7/1/2021 17:45,stocks,"Focus on other things in your life, and just keep adding to your positions. If after a couple years, it's not looking good then make it whatever changes you need."
7/1/2021 17:48,stocks,"I started trading back in December and I haven‚Äôt sold one stock since I purchased them. I think it‚Äôs two main reasons - you only invest in companies you believe and that has good potential and you only invest money you are willing to lose. 

Even if you get only get a profit of $100 be happy. Don‚Äôt get greedy too quickly. If you can sell 10 stocks for a $100 profit each you have $1000. That is a small sum to begin with but just stick to it and slowly the more money you make, the more you invest and the more your profits grow."
7/1/2021 18:03,stocks,"You need to distant yourself from your invested money. Cannot be looking at it like it‚Äôs your pocket money. Unless it is your pocket money.. then Don‚Äôt invest it.

7/1/2021 17:45,stocks,"I asked the same thing a few weeks ago and people here were super nice giving their advice. And to be honest I‚Äôve been down on most of my positions for some time, but this week I‚Äôm already green on total gains on most of them.

My best take out - don‚Äôt check your portfolio at all. If you want to understand how the market is doing in general - check main indexes - Dow, Nasdaq and sp500 at the opening and after market is closed, so you can understand the general perspective without the need to check your own portfolio. Come back in 1-1.5 months to Check your account and you will be pleasantly surprised:))"

7/1/2021 18:16,stocks,When you have been investing for a while you eventually disassociate from your day to day portfolio performance. If you can‚Äôt stomach a red day here or there you are over-leveraged.
7/1/2021 18:20,stocks,Just think of red days as opportunities to buy more
7/1/2021 18:29,stocks,"I'll tell you right now, unless you are thinking about adding more to your portfolio or are involved with daytrading, constantly looking at how the market is doing specifically with your own stocks is unhealthy. You don't want to be reactionary. Your due diligence should have been done before you purchased any stocks you currently own.

7/1/2021 18:42,stocks,"If you can't stomach the down days, you are either wrong about your risk tolerance or you didn't properly understand the risk involved when you entered your position. Do your homework about what you hold. 

""Down"" is always a possible direction. You have to decide before you enter how far down is possible, how far you're willing to tolerate, and how long you're willing to wait before it comes back up. 

More homework is to know more about the direction of the company. For my major YOLO plays, I'm not at all concerned about a day's red movement. As long as no news materially impacts the direction or performance of the company, then deep red days are buying opportunities. 

* One of my positions was red by $over $8K a few weeks ago. I kept following them and didn't see any valid reason why it was down, so I kept buying. I don't expect its significant movement to begin for another couple months, and it should take more than a year. (It's back up to almost even now.) 
* Another of my positions doesn't allow for that. It's a play I'm in because I expect earnings at the end of the month, combined with the outlook for the rest of the year, to move the stock upward by mid- to late-August. If this ever reaches any more than 5 or 7 percent below where I've bought, then I can only assume I missed something or the market has fundamentally changed its valuation of the company and it's time to get out. 

In both of these cases, red days with no news don't bother me in the least, because I have a firm understanding of my timeline and my tolerance for fluctuation in the meantime."

Certainly not perfect or infallible but decent for sure."
7/1/2021 17:37,stocks,">It's easy for dishonest firms to buy a position and later go on news shows, like CNBC and Cramer, to tell people they should be buying the stock, too.

I avoid IPOs like the plague. if it's a good company, it'll still be a good investment in a year. if it's a bad company, that'll be exposed in a year. 

as for analysts, to quote from *Big Money Thinks Small* (2017), by Joel Tillinghast (manager of FLPSX at Fidelity)

>By shutting out refuting evidence, we become vulnerable to overoptimism that our chosen stocks will flourish. Wall Street encourages this tendency because anyone can buy a stock, while only owners can sell. Buy recom- mendations far outnumber sells. For estimates of a company‚Äôs earnings more than a year out and long-term growth rates, reality chronically falls short. **Declining earnings are rarely forecast but often occur.** This does not apply to predictions of the next two quarters, which, if anything, are slightly low. **Companies and analysts tacitly collude to create quarterly ‚Äúupside surprises.‚Äù** (p. 21)"

7/1/2021 18:12,stocks,"For price targets, try to find the DCF models analysts use to get their price target. See if their numbers (discount rate, multiples, growth projections, etc.) are sensible and match up with how you view the company."

 If you want to do the research and maintenance that a portfolio of specific holdings would require, go for it. There's nothing wrong with that.

7/1/2021 18:04,stocks,"I agree with your premise, OP. 

Buffet recommends picking roughly 7 companies that are phenomenal businesses, giving you the best probability of outperforming the market. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook fit this description.

It‚Äôs just a matter of having the proper industry knowledge so you know where the industry is going and if these companies will have a relevant, growing position in society moving forward. 

If you know what you‚Äôre doing you don‚Äôt need to diversify. Diversification is protection against ignorance which is why it‚Äôs recommended most people index invest since they won‚Äôt put the work in."

Not saying these things will happen but if you concentrate in the biggest market caps and something bad happens, you‚Äôll take a huge bath. Whereas if you have a good deal of these but also diversify more then one crisis hurts less.

Also this portfolio will outperform ETFs in the short run now because tech stocks seem valued very high even compared to a lot of other stocks now. That could change at some point."

historically speaking you are wrong. many of the too big to fail companies in the past decades... well, failed. 

perhaps the landscape has changed and the current big tech will remain but thats a bit of a gamble. tech has had an absolutely nutty decade but will it continue?

buying spy/qqq/whole market is easy, reliable, has a strong history of long term performance."

Main reason I'm not ALL in on spy is that I think there are overvalued companies, and don't want to own them. For example, I dont like that nvidia would make up like 1% of spy.

7/1/2021 18:57,stocks,"to quote from a podcast interview with Rob Arnott: 

>At the very top of the list, we did a paper called ""Top Dogs"" that looked at the largest market capitalization stocks in each sector, in each country, and the worldwide top dog, which today is Microsoft. What we found is that the top dog in any sector--and this is a global phenomenon; we tested it in eight developed economies around the world--the number-one stock in each sector on average underperforms by 5% per year compounded over the next 10 years relative to its own sector.

7/1/2021 17:54,stocks,"Because it's more likely that one of those companies does down than the entire economy. And also because market growth tends to be driven by a handful of stocks (like 2 or 3) percent, while most stocks underperform the market. So your choices will probably underperform the market. 

The thing is, these companies can be great companies and be successful but underperform their prices. A great company is not that good to own-- and will probably underperform the market-- if it is priced like a great company. Buying index funds gives you a good chance at capital appreciation in the long run, and for the reasons I just said, probably a better chance than those big companies. On the other hand, index funds seriously protect your downside versus owning 10 stocks.

Another way of looking at it: if you want to really outperform the market, it doesn't make much sense to choose a handful of US mega-caps, since their performance has a massive impact on indexes already. So if you expect them to do well, and you invest in the SP500, and you are correct that they will do well, you already caught most of that upside, just with much less downside. If you really want to outperform the market, then, try to focus on companies with massive growth potential (yes, Apple has growth potential, but 10x?? no way) or with seriously low valuations."
7/1/2021 17:09,stocks,Index funds will always be limited returns. And it‚Äôs very easy to see which co‚Äôs will be safe with more upside
7/1/2021 18:02,stocks,"That‚Äôs why you invest in companies with phenomenal leadership - one of Buffet‚Äôs key investing rules. Big tech is very well ran, there isn‚Äôt any material anti-trust risk currently (hint how I said material, there‚Äôs perceived risk which is different)."
7/1/2021 17:15,stocks,"In the case of tech companies the landscape is much more different now than it was 10-30 years ago. A lot of these large companies consolidate  newer less established ones as well as diversifying into many sectors. 

Maybe I'll have to look at the numbers more, but from a very shallow perspective it seems that the top 10 companies now are more robust to failure and would perform better in the long run"
7/1/2021 18:02,stocks,This is the right answer.
7/1/2021 17:38,stocks,"For my own knowledge can you please provide some examples of the too big to fail companies you've mentioned?

My reasoning is that large companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon have diversified revenue streams that you can't just classify them as just tech companies. To the point where they  almost seem like ETFs themselves (if that makes sense). Compared to other businesses who aren't as diversified and therefore much more likely to failure."
7/1/2021 19:27,stocks,"Yep, look at HP."
7/1/2021 19:46,stocks,"And thats wrong....

7/1/2021 18:01,stocks,"Makes no sense.

If tech continues to outperform, then it will 3-5x the market since it makes up 20% of the S&P in its current form."
7/1/2021 17:22,stocks,"20-30 years is just a long time to still be at the top and outperforming is all I‚Äôm saying. Things are different now but there‚Äôs no guarantee that it will be the same. Like I said, I think they will continue to do well but in the long term it‚Äôs risky. As long as OP continues to reevaluate year after year, great. But I‚Äôd be hard-pressed to say it‚Äôs a good idea to only invest using this methodology."
7/1/2021 17:51,stocks,"Thinking that ‚Äúthese times are different‚Äù is overly simplistic. Circumstances change over time, yes, but it‚Äôs historically always been difficult to imagine how a top company in the world will begin to stagnate and underperform expectations at their peak. As others have stated, it‚Äôs inherently more difficult to grow the bigger you become. 

Just be careful about taking a snap-shot perspective on the market and assume current trends will continue over extended periods of time."
7/1/2021 19:33,stocks,"Hewlett Packard. It was the largest tech company in the world then a few bad mistakes and tanked. Your thought process is not wrong but there is no way to predict future. Also AIG tanked as well in 2008. You can't compare now and 2008 but things can go south and it can tank fast. Always put a stop loss if you are investing in tech stocks. Good luck. 

Just fyi, I have Amazon and apple stocks in my portfolio."
7/1/2021 18:50,stocks,Sears. They even had an exclusive deal with (arguably) the best line of hand tools in the country and they still went under.
7/1/2021 18:00,stocks,"Sad that you‚Äôre being downvoted and no one is responding to you. Cowards.

They probably think 2021 is the same as the dot com crash"
7/1/2021 18:13,stocks,"Economic calculation problem not only affects socialist countries it affects every central planned economy, including large monopolistic corporations. They will eventually reach a point where they are so large that smaller specialized companies will outcompete them because they can gather market information more efficient with less bureaucracy."
7/1/2021 18:14,stocks,"1) if tech continues to outperform, that does not mean that it will perform at 3x the market, that means it will perform no kess than a hair over 1x. 

2) op didn't say anything about big tech, they mentioned 3 companies, 2 were tech, sector vs market is a different conversation than 5-10 concentrated stock positions vs market. 

3) the whole point of what I said is that you can't predict what will outperform what. and the premise of your point is that you can, which is wrong. 

4) even if tech performs as well as you think it will, there is no predicting which tech companies account for that performance. could be apple and microsoft, but it could be like biotech and AI. There's no telling, which is why you buy index funds, which guarantee exposure to outperformers. Some people buy tech index funds instead of tech companies for the same reason I suggested broad market funds over any individual companies."
7/1/2021 17:59,stocks,It‚Äôs not about thinking ‚Äúthis time is different‚Äù. It‚Äôs about  realizing that big tech as of today has a higher probability of outperforming the market currently than not. Based on their business models. It‚Äôs important to look at individual businesses and reaching an intrinsic value on their stock price.
7/1/2021 18:58,stocks,"Correct me if I'm wrong, wasn't most of Sears revenue from their brick and mortar locations? My question was referring to large companies that failed who were similarly as diversified as Microsoft or Amazon"
7/1/2021 18:28,stocks,"1. 3-5x in terms of total returns assuming the top 10 market caps continue to outperform the bottom 490 companies over the next decade (this is too optimistic admittedly. But compound growth is killer if the business continues to rapidly expand year over year. It would also make up more of the S&P as well though to be fair, which favors index investing in terms of optimal risk-reward). 

2. OP was talking about the top 10 companies by market cap which is all big tech other than Johnson & Johnson, and Berkshire Hathaway. They named Microsoft, Apple, and Visa off-hand. 

3. I Hate this crystal ball argument, of course the future is impossible to 100% predict. That‚Äôs why you pick financially healthy companies with great growth prospects and economic moats. You invest in companies that give you the highest probability of outperforming the market. It‚Äôs obvious a company like Microsoft is likely going to outperform a mid-cap company such as Texas Roadhouse. Just as how I can‚Äôt guarantee I won‚Äôt be alive tomorrow. But I have a higher chance of living if I pay attention while driving a car vs texting while driving. 

4. You don‚Äôt just invest in one company. You invest in a handful of individual stocks that you expect to have a high probability of beating the market (Buffet and Lynch recommend 7-15 roughly). People should only do this if they know what they are doing. The average person should stick to indexes if they are not willing to do the research of course. 

I‚Äôm not disagreeing with index investing as much as I want to highlight that beating the market isn‚Äôt this absurdly, low probability phenomenon people want to believe that it is. OP has the right premise for a high probabilistic chance to beat the market."
7/1/2021 19:30,stocks,"I'm not sure. They were just the most recent example of a company that was ""too big to fail"" that I'm aware of. In the 80s they were the largest retailer in the United States. You went there for everything, clothes, hand tools, tires, appliances, camping stuff, workout equipment; they were the Amazon of their day. How could a juggernaut like that fail?"
7/1/2021 19:59,stocks,3 is where you won the argument. Its also worked for me in exactly the way you describe over the past two decades. His response below displays he doesn‚Äôt understand company financials.
7/1/2021 18:39,stocks,"Beating the market isn't rare, but doing so over the long run on a risk adjusted basis is. It sounds like you get that. My issue is with number 3: picking profitable stong moat high growth business as a rule will not be highly successful. The reason is that companies like that are super expensive to invest in. People often think about investing in companies in a manner that divorces them from their price. Great companies are often not great investments. Even if they perform well as a company (which is easy to predict, as you say) it does not follow that they will perform well as a stock. The tech bubble from 20 years ago is a great example of that: Microsoft was a great company back then (and there was occasion to project it forward), no doubt, but not a great investment considering its price. Would you rather pay a PE ratio of 1 for texas roadhouse or 1000 for microsoft? An obnoxious example, but illustrative nonetheless: you're investing in a company for a price, not in a vaccuum, and the price you pay determines the quality of the investment, not the performance of the company. Better to own bad companies at good values than good companies at bad values. Relating this to OP, they might end up doing the second of these (not saying that those are at bad prices, just that they could be)."

7/1/2021 16:26,stocks,"Not that I could find, maybe someone else has an idea of the valuation ball park for the IPO.

As of right now, a quick Google search shows Robinhood has a market cap of $11.7 billion, but that will obviously change as the IPO approaches"
7/1/2021 16:32,stocks,"I think I read somewhere today that 1st qtr revenue was around 500m, so 11.7b would be a steal. I‚Äôd guess maybe 20-30b at time of IPO? 

Personal opinion - great time for Robinhood to go public. Last year has been amazing for the company‚Äôs growth, and next 3-6 months should continue the trend. Saying that, at some point all of these brokerages will make excellent short candidates. All of them have grown massively with the recent bull market, but it‚Äôs not sustainable."

If you play the stock market without understanding what you're doing, you're going to learn the hard way about risk tolerance and emotional investing. The best ways to master those facets involve spending more time actively investing than you have left before you need to pull all your money out. 

You say moderate risk-reward, but imagine trading sideways for a few months, tanking 20-25 percent, then six months later, you've only recovered half the ground, leaving you down ten percent with only a couple months to go. What does that do to your plans for the van?

7/1/2021 19:28,stocks,"PLTR is still priced at 38x sales. For context AMZN is 4.13, AAPL is 7.04, hell- even TSLA is 18.17.

PLTR might do well in the next year, but it could EASILY fall by 50% even with good YOY growth. That‚Äôs because PLTR‚Äôs price is almost entirely being bolstered by market sentiment rather than current fundamentals and the fundamentals have a LONG way to go to catch up. If there is any indication that PLTR will slow growth, this kind of valuation will crater.

Say what you will about it‚Äôs future potential, but there is literally nothing moderate about the risk of holding PLTR for the next 12 months."

RH got a lot of people to own their first stock at cost (via paying them a stock) which came out of VC funding most likely, and now Fidelity is going to benefit from that promotional effort due to all of the people RH brought into the market who've now transferred over to them. That number is in the millions of users per quarter that RH paid to acquire, and then lost to a better-funded competitor with broader capabilities. Additionally, the business model itself (PFOF) is under scrutiny. Fidelity can survive and probably not even lose income if PFOF gets made illegal tomorrow, RH would be dead in a month. 

These are not things that lend themselves to a successful investment. A good trade? Maybe, maybe not. I would not trust the numbers they are putting out even as far as a day trade goes for the IPO. Insiders are trying to cash out fast and will have no hesitation to leave buyers holding the bag."

7/1/2021 18:58,stocks,It can depend. If a 1.5% dip was not expected then their short term investment theory may be invalidated so they dump it. For example you may look at previous patterns and think the stock will jump 10%  over a week. But if it instead dips by a certain amount then your stock analysis may be off or incorrect. You aren‚Äôt sure where it will go and don‚Äôt want to baghold so you dump.

If you go into a purchase planning for a decade plus hold, like its ridiculous to back out because of normal day to day fluctuations immediately after purchase. But there's certainly been comments and posts in the vain of ""I saw red and slammed the sell button."" 

But yes. If we zoom down to much shorter time scales, it can make a lot of sense to dump after being down 1.5%. I swing trade on the side and often exit a trade at a loss."

- 7.5% CAGR (compounded growth rate, useful for calculating long term expected growth but useless for short term averages) this is usually where the 8% comes from

- 10% average growth (mean of all YOY growth figures, useful for benchmarking year to year but not suitable for compounding calculations) this number even more so than others is heavily variable based on the time range used since the range is massive (like -50 to +40) and it's a simple mean.

If you want to take some out you could take out  the original investment so you just have house money left.

Otherwise trimming it back down to the $100 you want to have invested sounds fine.

I've done both of those for different reasons. Sometimes I take my original investment out and sometimes I trim it to a certain dollar amount.

If you want to still own ford in 3-5 years then it probably doesn't make sense to take anything out. If it was just something you saw value in that you were always planning to sell when it was priced better then maybe take profit."

Selling almost everything would mean you either have lost belief in the company's future, you feel it's overvalued, or you feel that there is a better opportunity elsewhere for your money. But why sell if you don't need the money in the near term and you have a firm belief in the stock and where it's at currently? At the end of the day, trimming a little bit off your position to lock in some profits won't hurt you, just don't look back at it later with regret. Hindsight is 20/20.

You can increase your position in that way without investing more money.

Usually people wait for a stock to go up and then pull out their original investment amount to reinvest somewhere else. This would leave you with 85$ of free Ford stock that you just sit on forever or let it grow and pull it out later."

source: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/business/dealbook/robinhood-fine-ipo.html

___

Robinhood clears the decks for its I.P.O.
Robinhood racked up another big fine yesterday, this time from the financial industry regulator known as FINRA. It‚Äôs the latest blow to the online brokerage, which has faced a series of accusations of misleading and marooning customers. But the company sees an upside to its latest legal run-in, too: It believes it has resolved lingering issues enough to move forward with its long-anticipated I.P.O.

FINRA hit Robinhood with a $70 million fine, the regulator‚Äôs largest ever, for a host of sins, including giving customers wrong information about trading on margin, failing to properly determine whether customers should have been approved to trade options and not properly shoring up its technical systems to avoid a series of outages between 2018 and 2020 that led to losses for customers.

That‚Äôs on top of previous fines, including a $65 million one by the S.E.C. in December for misleading customers.

And the hits may keep on coming. Lawmakers, who pummeled Robinhood‚Äôs C.E.O., Vlad Tenev, during a hearing in February, want tougher penalties: ‚ÄúRobinhood won‚Äôt clean up its act with slap-on-the-wrist settlements,‚Äù Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted. ‚ÄúOur regulators need to show some backbone to hold Robinhood accountable.‚Äù The company still faces several pending suits and investigations:

Massachusetts‚Äô top securities regulator sued Robinhood earlier this year, seeking to bar the company from operating in the state because of its aggressive marketing tactics.

The S.E.C. is still reviewing the company‚Äôs role in the January meme-stock rally.

Robinhood is a defendant in dozens of potential class action lawsuits from retail traders arising from trading restrictions during the meme-stock frenzy. The cases were consolidated into a single case in South Florida and divided into four parts, including ‚Äúthe Robinhood tranche.‚Äù Next month, the plaintiffs must file a single combined complaint for each of the four claims ‚Äî and it could drag on for a long time.

But the, uh, good news for Robinhood is that it‚Äôs moving ahead with its I.P.O., with the brokerage set to publish its prospectus imminently, DealBook‚Äôs Michael de la Merced and Erin Griffith report for The Times. Settling the FINRA investigations appears to have been the final legal hurdle that the company wanted to clear before ‚Äúflipping‚Äù its hitherto confidential I.P.O. document. (Keep your eyes peeled for the rundown of the company‚Äôs legal issues in the document, which could run to novella length.) If all goes to plan, expect Robinhood‚Äôs own shares to begin trading before the August doldrums."

It's no wonder it came up in a case study of my international business class, and as a IB major, I believe that companies like these have a huge advantage. With massive supply chains, and integration into multiple markets, stocks like these are both flexible and capable of huge earnings growth, as their dominance in larger foreign markets allows them to slowly integrate into more specialized markets.

Their PE ratio reflects this as it is trading just over a ratio of 10, but earning around 17 in it's 5 year average. A ratio of 10 is generally reasonable regardless of industry, and it's also ahead of it's dividend yield average, currently yielding at 2.57% 

With this international diversity, risk of political barriers to earnings are lower when so much of its sales are driven by foreign markets. 

Their balance sheet is also balanced with the company having a current ratio of about 1, but no huge concerns with long term debt. The company is neither under nor overleveraged in my opinion, and still has time to take advantage of cheap fed interest rates in the US

If you want a stock whose earnings is less affected by US markets, consider adding WHR to your portfolio."

There have been situations when I‚Äôve been invested in a stock and have watched the bid/ask price closely only to be confounded by the ask price‚Äôs actions. There will be situations when the ask price will refuse to budge over the last price sale. Sometimes even staying below the last sale for quite some time.

In the situations in which the ask price stays at the last sale price, it will just stay there even while quite a few sales at that price are being done, until eventually of course when a last sale price is lower and closer to the bid price, at which time the ask price just simply drops.

I understand the ask/bid price is based off supply and demand, but logic says when demand is there at that current price, ask for a little more, I just don‚Äôt get it!!  This has happened to me on stocks that were allegedly being heavily shorted, but I wasn't sure if that would play into it.

7/1/2021 0:00,stocks,"Connecting the Dots: My High-Conviction Bet on Paysafe (PSFE) It was evident that PSFE had finally found bottom last week.  For months, we saw all the tell-tale signs of market manipulators expertly shaking out retail shareholders with order flow, short volume, massive block trades and 13F‚Äôs showing institutions steadily loading up.  In this context, just as PSFE was to be officially added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 indexes, it seemed a little suspicious that Paysafe was suddenly being hyped and trending on WallStreetBets.  I had to wonder if this was an engineered event to generate more liquidity since market makers were clearly running out of sellers right when they had to fill a lot more institutional orders.

That‚Äôs all just monkey brain theory that ultimately doesn't matter because my plan is to hold PSFE long-term.  There is a clear strategy with this company that will take some time to come to fruition and I want to be in on the ground floor, before all the rosy ER‚Äôs come in.  With a fintech that does roughly as much transactional volume as Square and, despite recent reports, has similar growth to PayPal, it‚Äôs no surprise that institutions want to accumulate at levels so low that the stock is almost completely de-risked from a long-term perspective.

The comprehensive DD below is for investors with a longer view who may have been caught in the recent hype. Know that you‚Äôre not alone. We saw the same thing right after CNBC‚Äôs Jim Cramer called Paysafe, ‚Äúthe ultimate stock for this moment‚Äù and market analyst Steve Grasso repeated his calls for it go to ‚Äú$45/$50 and then settle in before moving higher from there.‚Äù  After initial spikes, deep-pocketed short-sellers methodically crushed retail holders, eventually bringing the price down to where it was last week.

But informed short sellers knew they couldn't push too far because that price was really not far from the price paid by noted fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 10 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares) and Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares).  A price probably lower than paid by Wells Fargo‚Äôs several funds (12 million shares) and even by Blackstone when they raised their initial stake of 123 million shares to a total of 160 million shares.^(1)  Also, it‚Äôs worth noting that, since they all decided to invest, Paysafe has created significant value including securing new revenue streams in the US iGaming market and expanded partnerships with Coinbase, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, and Microsoft among others. ^(2)

With a presence in 120 countries, Paysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor: #1 global leader in iGaming, #2 global digital wallet, #4 globally in integrated merchant processing. Ever since private equity groups Blackstone and CVC took Paysafe private, they‚Äôve been going through a major restructuring to reduce risk, increase margins and profits. It's because they are still very much in the middle of that process that I like it so much as an investment opportunity. Here are a few key points:

&#x200B;

* In 2017, private equity groups Blackstone and CVC raised their bid five times to ultimately to take Paysafe private for $3.9 billion.^(3)  Blackstone says their typical investment term is ‚Äúupwards of 7-10 years‚Äù ^(4) which aligns with the investment time-frame implied by an inside source close to those negotiations who said, ‚ÄúThere is a fundamental change in the way we pay for goods and services, away from the cash and cheques of our parents‚Äô age,‚Äù adding that the private equity firms ‚Äúhave a decade-long thesis that this shift will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.‚Äù ^(5)
* Under Blackstone/CVC‚Äôs stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). Last year, due to Covid-related brick-and-mortar business and sporting event closures, along with their long-standing strategic decision to exit specific high-risk Asian revenue channels, 2020 revenue stagnated.  This is the reason they recently reported only 5% YoY quarterly growth.  In their Q1 ER, management noted that, without those channel exits they would have reported growth in the ‚Äúmid to high teens.‚Äù  But even if you include 2020‚Äôs stagnant growth, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal‚Äôs current projected growth. ^(6,7)
* A few months ago, Paysafe was brought public through a reverse merger transaction with acclaimed deal maker Bill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity. The deal paid down $1.2 billion in debt and gave Blackstone/CVC about $5.6 billion in cash and shares.^(8)  The fact that Blackstone's recent 13F shows they bought back 37 million shares, combined with statements from them and Paysafe's board, indicates that they did this deal, not for a mere 44% gain on a four year investment, but because Bill Foley is an extraordinarily successful and well-connected deal maker who has a proven track record for generating exponential growth.
* Inorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe‚Äôs strategy going forward.  Bill Foley, now Chairman of Paysafe and a major shareholder, is a proven M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena.  Foley took Fidelity National Financial from $3 million market cap to $10.8 billion. Yeah, that‚Äôs and ‚Äúm‚Äù and a ‚Äúb‚Äù.  Over just the last five years, Foley grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).  Through his proven M&A playbook, Foley also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion market cap. That‚Äôs a 36x return.  He says  ‚ÄúThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.‚Äù ^(6,9)

**Deleveraging, increasing margins and profit**

* Paysafe recently confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 projections of $1.53 billion in revenue, $930-$970 million in gross profit, double-digit growth and expanding 30-35% EBITDA margins, and $103 billion in transactional volume.  Paysafe‚Äôs already strong $362 million in 2020 free cash flow was reported to be on track for 29% growth in 2021.  Notably, their multi-year projections don‚Äôt include growth from their ""active M&A pipeline"" and their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR).
* Q1's earnings disappointed some because, as part of their restructuring, they had $90 million in one-time non-recurring expenses associated with the merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. The company noted: ‚ÄúResults included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.""
* Take away the $90 million in one-time expenses and, rather than reporting a $49 million loss, the company would have reported $41 million in quarterly net profit, thereby beating all analyst estimates. All signs indicate they are on track to beat estimates going forward, although I have noticed a few platforms raising those estimates recently.
* In addition to paying down $1.2 billion in debt, an improved Moody‚Äôs credit rating has enabled the company to refinance roughly a billion at a 1.25% lower interest rate, with an option to reduce it another 25bp.^(10)  Foley says: ‚ÄúOne of the keys to this transaction and value creation for our shareholders is the reduction of Paysafe‚Äôs leverage ratio to 3.6x Debt/EBITDA.‚Äù  Notably, this Debt/EBITDA ratio is far better than the majority of their fintech peers, and the resulting improved margins stand to make it better still.
* The combined effect of overall recent debt management will be a savings of around $92 million annually.  This secures higher margins, increased cash for M&A and higher profits which, in my view, will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.
* As part of their restructuring to cut down on operating expenses and further increase margins, Paysafe has recently forged agreements with Snowflake and AWS as they move to cloud-based integration for easier migration between their platforms, easier cross-border payments and planned expansion into global banking as a service, having identified a $58 trillion TAM.

**Highly competitve**

* Unlike other payment processors, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion ‚Äúunbanked‚Äù globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.  Just yesterday, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.
* In various segments, Paysafe has recently expanded their partnerships with FOX bet, Roblox, Fortnight, Coinbase, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Draftkings, Spotify, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, BetMGM, Ceasar‚Äôs, and Pointsbet among many others.
* \#4 globally in integrated merchant processing, Paysafe‚Äôs proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted ‚ÄúBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution‚Äù, ‚ÄúPayment Processor of the Year,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBest Payment Method.‚Äù
* They are #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted ‚ÄúBest Digital Wallet‚Äù for ‚Äúbest consumer take up‚Äù, ‚Äúmost innovative technology‚Äù with ‚Äúgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.‚Äù
* People are usually more likely to leave reviews when a payment platform doesn‚Äôt meet their expectations. That said, Trustpilot rates Paysafecard as ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe‚Äôs digital wallet Skrill as ‚Äúgreat‚Äù (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews). ^(11)
   * By contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as ‚ÄúAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as ‚Äúbad‚Äù (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as ‚Äúbad‚Äù (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as ""bad"" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews). ^(12)

**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.""** \- Bill Foley

&#x200B;

* Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter, due to managing risk and a very complex regulatory landscape. Paysafe‚Äôs advantage here is a large aspect of its MOAT, as discussed below.  Paysafe is often an integrated back-end payment processor so most don‚Äôt realize they are using it but they are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion in the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting.
* Bill Foley says, ""It‚Äôs going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else‚Ä¶we‚Äôre seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that‚Äôs headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We‚Äôve got a wide landscape we can attack. It‚Äôs pretty exciting‚Äù
* In his letter to investors, fund manager Dan Loeb said, ‚ÄúWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.‚Äù
* Compass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso, who initiated coverage with a $19 price target, noted, ‚ÄúPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,‚Äù adding, ‚Äúwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.‚Äù ^(13)
   * Recent headlines since Del Grasso wrote that:

&#x200B;

* Every analyst covering Paysafe rates it as a ""Buy"". A few quotes :
   * RBC Capital 5-star analyst Daniel Perlin: ‚ÄúWe believe PSFE offers a unique combination of digital wallet capabilities, accelerated cash conversion for consumers who would otherwise be out of the ecommrece loop, and integrated payments, all focused on specialized & complex end-markets, which creates a competitive moat and pricing power.‚Äù ‚Äúrecent underperformance is largely due to the complex nature of PSFE‚Äôs business and the FTAC II transaction‚Äù and adds his view that Paysafe offers one of the best combinations of services in online payment space: ‚ÄúPSFE has created a unique two-sided network enabling merchants to accept online & in-store payments (in specific niche verticals), while also offering consumers a digital wallet & eCash solution, which converts cash-heavy users to digital users. We believe it‚Äôs this combination that enables PSFE to generate superior take rate economics vs. peers.‚Äù ^(14)
   * BMO Capital, 5-star analyst, James Fotheringham: ‚ÄúPSFE is a global leader in iGaming (online betting related to sports, poker, and other casino games, as well as lotteries and bingo). Indeed, 36% of PSFE‚Äôs revenues are from global iGaming. That is far more than for any of its peers.‚Äù iGaming deposit volumes in the U.S. will grow ‚Äúat more than five times the rate of growth elsewhere in the world‚Äù with a ""5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of between 40% to 55%."" ^(15)
   * Evercore ISI analyst David Togut 'praised Paysafe for its ‚Äúrobust risk management operation,‚Äù and its high rankings in several key performance indictors globally, including cash network, stored digital wallet value, and amount of partnered independent merchants.' ^(16)

**MOAT:**  **‚Äúrobust risk management operation‚Äù**

So why does Paysafe dominate iGaming and why how is it able offer eCommerce services to the 1.7 billion globally who can't even manage to have bank accounts or credit cards?

Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter. CEO Philip McHugh from transcript : ‚ÄúWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it‚Äôs hard to copy.‚Ä¶We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It‚Äôs a real strength of ours. We‚Äôve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we‚Äôve upgraded the team, we‚Äôve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players‚Ä¶we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can‚Äôt do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we‚Äôre not only talking about take rates and comps, we‚Äôre talking about revenue-generation, we‚Äôre talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That‚Äôs a really, really powerful position to have.‚Äù ^(9)

&#x200B;

**Valuation:**

A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.

* Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin,  mid to high teen EBITDA growth, and $362 million in free cash flow (now on track to increase 29%),
* By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.
* Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.
* The group's collective growth rate of \~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account their current expansion into US iGaming nor do they factor in their ""active M&A pipeline.""  Foley is apparently known for under-promising and over-performing.
* As noted above, Paysafe was growing 28% CAGR pre-Covid, but taking into account last years slow down due to Covid-related business closures and strategic channel exits, it grew at 18% CAGR, a rate on par with PayPal's projected growth.

Given all the above factors, it seems fair to look at Paysafe's potential price based on an average of peer multiples:

Paysafe‚Äôs share price with average of sector peer multiples:

* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09
* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91
* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

More realistic price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100

* EV/EBITDA ratio : **$50.75**
* EV/Rev ratio : **$44.64**
* EV/FCF ratio : **$44.18**

**Average : $46.52**

In a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe‚Äôs conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better financials than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate. Either the entire field has to come down or Paysafe has to go up.  While I don't necessarily agree with his time frame, market analyst Steve Grasso's call for ""$45/55"" may actually be quite reasonable.

7/1/2021 11:01,stocks,"TLDR, but from my perspective -  Grasso said it‚Äôll triple, SPACS fell out of favor, this hit a clear bottom, and it‚Äôs not a SPAC anymore. All I see is limited downside and significantly more upside. And it‚Äôs a good business. It‚Äôs a buy."
7/1/2021 10:56,stocks,Holy shit that is a lot of text
7/1/2021 16:37,stocks,"Great company, have a position myself.

Some bearcases: 
- giant float 
- stagnant grow (but they are fixing that with SPAC combined team and cash made by SPAC) 
- competition 
- unclear about the esports industry and its potential"
7/1/2021 16:26,stocks,"Waiting for the lockup period to end, to increase position.  Nice company and already making $."

7/1/2021 11:03,stocks,Sounds about right.
7/1/2021 11:00,stocks,"Yeah, I like to compile most of my DD in one place so it's easy to reference.  Though it might be helpful to others."
7/1/2021 16:47,stocks,"Good points. Not sure if you read the post but I'll respond to each point.

* The large float definitely makes it hard to move the stock but it also makes it attractive to institutions seeking larger investment vehicles for their capital.  The problem is that they'll keep the price down for as long as they need to load which is typically a slow process.
* So far stagnant growth has only been last year, affected by Covid and exiting high-risk revenue channels in Asia.  28% CAGR prior to that. 18% CAGR inclusive of that which is on par with PayPal's projections.
* They do very well against competitors in their niche verticals because they can mitigate risk and handle diverse regulatory requirements better than most. See section on MOAT
* Sportsbetting/iGaming is expected to be their strongest growth segment going forward and this is where they are currently dominant globally with first mover advantage in just about every country."
7/1/2021 16:35,stocks,"Which lockup are you concerned about? The one that had people worried was private equity lockup, which by most counts already ended either last Friday or this last Monday.  4/29 marked 20th trading day above $12 after merger. 60 days thereafter was June 28th.

PIPE lock up is much less of a concern right because we are not much higher than where they bought in."
7/1/2021 11:36,stocks,"If my dumb brain is correct. Warrant holders can be forced to redeem them if the stock price trades above a certain level, 18$, for a consecutive of 20 trading days. If you don‚Äôt convert them to ordinary shares, they will expire worthless."
7/1/2021 11:09,stocks,"Plus it just got a bit of a WSB pump. I‚Äôve been considering a position since it bottomed in the 10‚Äôs. This might just be the post that gets me to dip my toes in. Still a chance it heads back to the 11‚Äôs, but in a few years I see at least 3x."
7/1/2021 19:42,stocks,RemindMe! 1 month
7/1/2021 11:59,stocks,"That's about right. You'll have 30 days to convert once they are called.  But that will be a good problem to have as warrants will be worth a minimum of $6.50 if commons are trading at $18.  A 90% gain from the current warrant price.

I expect they'll want commons to get well above $19 or $20 before they call in warrants.  I'm hoping they don't call them in until common are in the $30's at least.  There are many insiders holding warrants so it is in there interests as well."

7/1/2021 0:00,stocks,"Understanding Enterprise Value Almost everyone considers P:E when buying stock in a company, but have you considered their [EV/EBITDA](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072715/what-considered-healthy-evebitda.asp)? One is not necessarily better than the other, but It can be very helpful to consider a companies Enterprise Value.

Say you were considering buying 2 cars, and they both cost $30k. But one has $2000 cash in the glove compartment, and the other had $2000 in unpaid parking tickets in the glove. That would be important information to you, right? If you only look at market cap and not Enterprise Value (EV), you are ignoring what's in the glove compartment.

Consider 2 companies with a similar market cap, say INTC ($226.7B) and CSCO ($223.4B). If you just look at their market caps, you might say they are close enough (1.5% difference) that you will just directly compare their income statements. But Cisco has $29.4B in cash and only $14.5B in debt, so when you buy their stock, you are also buying some of their cash reserves. This is included in the Enterprise Value (EV) which is $223.4B+$14.5B-$29.4B=$208.5B

Intel has $23.9B cash and $36B debt, so their EV is $226.7B+$36B-$23.9B=$238.8B

So when you consider their cash and debt, Intel can be considered 14.5% more expensive than Cisco instead of 1.5%.

It's not always the be all end all, but it can be very helpful to look at Enterprise Value when you are comparing stocks."
7/1/2021 13:04,stocks,"I almost use Enterprise Value to EBITDA but it dpeens on teh type of company. For ex, there's no point in using EV to EBITDA for a bank. They are tradionally priced on earnings and book value, plus now revenues a little.  But for asset heavy companies or industries that take on a lot of debt sometimes you want to look at the company independent of the effects of financing considerations and how they depreciate their assets."
7/1/2021 9:49,stocks,Just one data point among many you should consider. And I don't know shit.
7/1/2021 9:47,stocks,Businesses that focus on ebitda are crooks
7/1/2021 13:23,stocks,"For younger tech companies, I quite like EV/GP since they reinvest a lot of profits into R&D so looking at EBITDA is kinda meaningless"
7/1/2021 9:53,stocks,"As an investor it's certainly an additional tool,  as long as you look hard at the depreciation value which companies generally don't value correctly. If a ceo or cfo focuses on it,  stay clear"
7/1/2021 10:04,stocks,"You should be looking at these numbers for every company, not just the ones who tell you emphasize them. EBITDA is flawed, but it is a decent measure of how much cash business operations are bringing in. That's a helpful number as long as you are aware of what is being excluded from it."
7/1/2021 14:00,stocks,"what's GP? gross profits?  R&D you might be better off just looking as a percent of sales... technically, a market approach is gonna undervalue a company like a tech company with high early stage intellectual property.  They are just plain difficult to value i have to admit..."
7/1/2021 10:20,stocks,"Depreciation is not included in Enterprise Value or EBITDA.

Depreciation is subtracted from EBIT so that number can be fudged. It is added back into EBITDA so it is not a part of the number.

EV is just market cap - cash + debt. Non-cash assets that would depreciate are not included."
7/1/2021 13:23,stocks,"all i care about is earnings

EAITDA"
7/1/2021 14:28,stocks,"Definitely an important number. I would say that EBITDA can give you a better look at how the business is performing compared to its peers, since it shows how much money they make purely from business operations.

But higher net earnings are really the end goal so I see where you're coming from."

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know when meme stocks such as this will crash, but we probably do not have to wait too long, as I believe the retail crowd is fully invested in this theme, and Wall Street has jumped on the coattails,‚Äù Burry told Barron‚Äôs via email. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of new money available to jump on the bandwagon.‚Äù
 
I know meme stock investors love to quote Burry, so I‚Äôm curious to see their thoughts now that he has turned on them."
7/1/2021 12:23,stocks,It‚Äôs really no secret that meme stocks can crash at really any given moment‚Ä¶. Mostly everyone that‚Äôs invested knows the risks.
7/1/2021 9:38,stocks,"He went from saying entire market crash to going for meme stocks crash. Which any average person can say and has been for weeks about stuff like AMC,GME, etc. Seems like he wants to be proven right with meme stock crash to then use that for his full market crash fear mongering."
7/1/2021 9:48,stocks,"This guy analyzed Burry's track record and says it hasn't been very reliable. Not sure how this applies to meme predictions though.

7/1/2021 9:59,stocks,Michael Burry has been wrong a lot more than he has been right. He predicted WW3 and a global collapse years ago and none of it happened.
7/1/2021 9:52,stocks,"Maybe.

But he also says index funds are a bubble and are just like CDOs. To an extent, he's right that they're essentially CDOs, but how many millions of people and trillions of dollars rely on index funds for investing and retirement? That would require almost everyone to stop investing in them or even pull money from them and buy equities directly. I don't ever think that will happen.

Dude has lost a lot of money in shorting and bubble fear. That's why he buys barron land for water rights (or some bullshit) that no one cares about. He got it right once and now everyone gives him too much attention."
7/1/2021 9:37,stocks,Burry lost against SPY in the span of 15 years. Good luck following some clown noone cares bout.

++++GameStop Releases First Quarter 2021 Financial Results +++ 06/09/21
Net Sales Grew 25% to $1.3 Billion Appoints Technology Veterans Matt Furlong and Mike Recupero to CEO and CFO Positions, Respectively GRAPEVINE, Texas, June 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME ), today reported results for the first quarter ended May 1, 2021

GameStop is the epitome of value investing: Gaming revenue beat sports and movies combined in 2020 and expected to grow from 150B to 300B in the coming years. 

-0$ in debt 

-Raised 1.1 billion dollars from selling 5M shares (225$ average price)

-Added to the Russel 1000

-Top Growing stock in the last 52 weeks (up 4,900%) no stock comes even close to competing. 

-Ryan Cohen (ex Chewy Founder) was just elected Chairman of the board. 

-GameStop just elected a new CEO coming straight from Amazon. 

-Many executives on the board come from Chewy and Amazon. 

-GameStop Announces Multi-year Strategic Partnership with Microsoft (GameStop will also upgrade its e-commerce site as part of the partnership.)

-Recently entered the NFT space. 

-Worldwide media attention and known brand even overseas. 

-Heavily shorted: Melvin Capitol and Citadel both have open puts on the stock. Short squeeze is a very real topic for discussion. 

-Huge Institutional Ownership: 39,671,973 - 56.73% owned by institutional entities. BlackRock owns the most shares in GameStop (9,217,335 shares)
and hasn‚Äôt closed their position, they are holding and are up over 900% on their positions. They provide stability to the market, hence not dropping below 100$ and 200$ easily. (BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, with over $8 trillion in assets under management as of January 2021. BlackRock operates globally with 70 offices in 30 countries and clients in 100 countries)

-Full integrated social media presence. 

-Millions of power up rewards members and enormous fan base. 

-The only brick and mortar retail company dedicated exclusively to gaming. 

-Focus on customer services and providing excellent products and service. 

-Gaming consoles and now PC consoles make up a large portion of GameStops income.

Being debt free is unusual for brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Walmart Inc. and Best Buy Co., which have billions in long-term obligations. Some stores hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic actually borrowed additional funds last year to survive. GameStop finished its last fiscal year with $755.3 million in lease obligations, according to the company‚Äôs annual report."
7/1/2021 9:59,stocks,A broken clock is right twice a day
7/1/2021 9:39,stocks,"Apart from the original $WHACKD.
When those at risk of exposure start buying to burn it then the price will go up exponentially like nothing we have seen before."
7/1/2021 11:04,stocks,It will fluctuate
7/1/2021 9:50,stocks,"I think it would be different if burry said it by tweet. But since yahoo finance has been telling me to forget amc and forget Gamestop since January, and has not stopped telling me to forget Gamestop, I think they have a narrative that this fits into. And I wouldn't be surprised if the quote bury gave was reworded before being published. If you truly believe yahoo is right, then take a short position on meme stocks, I dare ya."
7/1/2021 9:49,stocks,ü§° = Burry
7/1/2021 16:29,stocks,The point is that it's not investing; it was pure speculation.
7/1/2021 18:32,stocks,"Or maybe he's saying the overall market will crash and that the meme stocks would be the most exposed because of how volatile it is? I mean, you're trying to draw reference to something that has no secondary meaning."
7/1/2021 9:50,stocks,It‚Äôll be just funny to see the meme crowd act like he‚Äôs a clown now when they‚Äôve been worshiping him for the past 2 months.
7/1/2021 11:59,stocks,A global collapse did happen........ but just for a few days. Then the governments decided to fuck over everyone else to save our portfolios.
7/1/2021 11:57,stocks,I doubt he lost a lot of money. He took a shitliad of bullish position in march 2020 then shifted to shorting tesla in 900$ and the coin when it was around 60k. Say what you want about the guy but he sure as hell isn't losing a lot of money.
7/1/2021 9:42,stocks,Kind of what I expected to here. Meme stock investors were quoting him like no other but as soon as he says something like this he knows nothing.
7/1/2021 12:03,stocks,"Gaming performing better than movies and sports is not why GME is up over 5,000%.

Also, with everything reopening, look for people‚Äôs entertainment dollars rotating back into live entertainment and other non-‚Äúsitting at home‚Äù activities. 

Sorry for not drinking the Koolaid, but GME is much more likely to go down than up in the next several months. At best, it‚Äôll trade sideways."
7/1/2021 10:58,stocks,"Gaming revenues were indeed great in 2020. What you fail to mention is that Gamestop's revenues have been on a decline every year since 2017. 2020 should have been their year but their sales were even lower than 2019! That alone should say a lot about how badly the company was managed. Let's see if the new management can turn it around, but saying that GME isn't a meme stock is pure bullshit"
7/1/2021 10:46,stocks,Movies and sports took a big dive and gaming an increase because of the pandemic. These conditions are once in a lifetime and says absolutely nothing about the future of GME.
7/1/2021 12:37,stocks,Lmao stop it. Even if GME continues to impress it's the king of meme stock. There's literally a feverish movement of you guys spilling into every corner of Reddit don't act like it's not a meme stock.
7/1/2021 9:41,stocks,It takes some massive cognitive dissonance to act like he‚Äôs not referring to GME. Even if you believe it‚Äôs a good investment.
7/1/2021 9:51,stocks,"Telling someone they have to short a stock if they think it‚Äôs overvalued is such a lazy thing to do and just signifies you have no response. 
 
You have to be insane to think he didn‚Äôt actually say this and the media is just making it up."
7/1/2021 12:41,stocks,"So funny seeing the ""then short it!"" Comment everywhere these days. Like you all had a powow and agreed it was the ultimate comeback.

If you're so convinced you own the float, why are so many of you trying to convince doubters to short?"
7/1/2021 16:40,stocks,"Exactly, if you made a significant gain in a short period on a stock like AMC just get out now, you‚Äôve already won."
7/1/2021 11:00,stocks,The meme stock pumpers will have to change their narrative once again and make him out to be a shill / villain / lizard person.
7/1/2021 11:57,stocks,Maybe it‚Äôs different people saying those things.
7/1/2021 15:39,stocks,They‚Äôre gambling and emotionally invested so it makes sense. Nothing illogical about what he‚Äôs saying and has said
7/1/2021 11:15,stocks,"You‚Äôre speaking of the retail stores revenue not their e commerce which is up way more than 400% YOY. Should we compare gaming to its brick and mortar or it‚Äôs online sales? If you exclude e commerce sales then‚Ä¶ umm what are you doing? They have a deal with Microsoft since 2020 to reinvent themselves into e-commerce. GameStop is the epitome of value investing, due to gaming revenue crushing movies and sports combined. ThTs UfC too."
7/1/2021 17:16,stocks,Anything worth swing  or day trading is a meme or pump n dump.theres trading and investing.dont know why ppl get so pissed about meme stocks it's a way to make money just like options.instead of the long term 10% a year investing.nothing wrong with that if your happy making less or need a safe bet for retirement.
7/1/2021 19:03,stocks,"GameStop has revealed a few things: It is executing ‚Äústrategic de-densification efforts‚Äù (i.e. closing 12% of brick-and-mortar stores this quarter), according to the company‚Äôs earnings report, and opening a new fulfillment center in Pennsylvania to ship out its products. The two new executives from Amazon (as well as newly elected chairman and former Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen) should better understand e-commerce, but calling this a ‚Äúdigital transformation‚Äù‚Äîas GameStop has repeatedly done‚Äîmight overstate the effort. Closing stores and improving shipping can only get the company so far as an e-commerce strategy."
7/1/2021 19:40,stocks,"It‚Äôs what you say it is, but memes don‚Äôt hire CEOs from Amazon.. you are a meme"
7/1/2021 10:13,stocks,"The man has autism, doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt know his world. This is the world of deep value stocks, time will show that gaming revenue will grow by 400% in the next few years. Most people are speculating on stocks that are not independently influenced by the pandemic and it‚Äôs many variants. And Tesla thrives during a pandemic, because their company is based around renewable energy and the future of transport. Tesla is a trillion dollar company. Many missed it, I hope you don‚Äôt miss both of these."
7/1/2021 10:28,stocks,"It‚Äôs the top performing stock in the last year, by a long shot, up 5,250%! It‚Äôs a good investment because it‚Äôs #1 and not affected negatively by the pandemic."
7/1/2021 11:50,stocks,"he didnt say they made it up, he said they might of reworded it. That shit happens all the time."
7/1/2021 11:48,stocks,"Do you think that's what he said word for word? A man that speaks in riddles, just goes ahead and says meme stocks are gone crash?. Ok man, you believe what you want to believe. I'm gonna go ahead and believe that nothing we hear from msm is 100% accurate."
7/1/2021 13:38,stocks,"I'm not trying to convince anytime to do anything. If you believe you're right, make a move on it.

Inaction doesn't do anything."
7/1/2021 12:10,stocks,Different people say and think differently? Get the fuck outta here
7/1/2021 11:52,stocks,"Assuming everything you‚Äôre saying regarding the e-commerce pivot comes true, wouldn‚Äôt this make GME a growth stock, not a value stock? It‚Äôs not a a store of wealth holding intrinsic value, it‚Äôs pivoting into a new space hoping for large growth that hasn‚Äôt yet materialized but bulls believe will. The bet is on its growth. Something huge and established would be a value stock, like Walmart or something."
7/1/2021 17:34,stocks,"Listen in very simple terms, while most publicly traded gaming companies had growth in 2020 vs 2019, Gamestop did not. Whether online or through their stores, they did not catch the wave that should have made them increase their sales. That's a very basic bear case, using Gamestop's old model of business of course though. That's why I'm saying perhaps bew management can turn things around, but if you look at Gamestop's annual earning reports over the past 5 years, it isn't a pretty picture"
7/1/2021 12:09,stocks,"Remindme! 3 years

Tesla is not a trillion dollar company. Your connection from them thriving during the pandemic because they use renewable energy makes no sense. And anyways,  pandemic is over. 

If gme revenue grows by 400% in the next couple years, they will generate 20 billion in revenue.They also have about 2 billion in assets and 1 billion in liablities (they do have debt idk why people say they dont). Needing to grow 400% to have revenue of of current market cap, and having a low book value is not a great spot. Gme as more than a squeeze play is really iffy."
7/1/2021 10:23,stocks,Not sure what his autism has to do with anything.
7/1/2021 12:00,stocks,"It was a good investment BEFORE it went up 5,250%. Once something over-inflates, it is no longer a good investment. 

It is priced as though the company has already successfully pivoted to a new business model with strong earnings (neither of which is true)."
7/1/2021 12:04,stocks,It‚Äôs a direct quote from an email he sent. Lol
7/1/2021 13:46,stocks,"Who says avoiding GME is inaction? I'm still researching and investing the same money every month. It's well known that you can be right about a price movement but wrong about the time frame and still lose out.

I'm not even saying you're wrong. Personally, it's all too much for my risk tolerance and I accept that I've missed out on massive gains that some have made. I just think ""why don't you short it then"" is a lame comeback and I've seen it all over Reddit, so it's clearly the new thing to say."
7/1/2021 19:01,stocks,"Fortunately, GameStop isn‚Äôt locked into many long-term leases. The majority of them expire within the next two years, giving the company flexibility to walk away from poor-performing locations.

7/1/2021 12:33,stocks,Also even successfully turning the company around and becoming profitable isn't a guarantee that it can ever reach the value it's currently priced at.

The company said it completed its voluntary early redemption of $216.4 million of its 10.0% senior notes due 2023."
7/1/2021 12:20,stocks,"Physical stores are assets not liabilities lol. Gme has 627 million of long term debt and 1.3 billion in current liabilities. That you think stores they own is part of that total is really concerning. Have you looked at their balance sheet?

Their partnership with Microsoft is them using a shit ton of Microsoft products and services. This may help the business, but its not like Microsoft is invested in GME lol. I read the press release and its basically gme saying they bought a bunch of Microsoft stuff. You know who else does that, every company on earth.

Edit - just realized first you called stores liabilities cause you go in there all the time, but then you said they were closing them all anyways. Which is it Regardless? Regardless of ur mistake about calling them ""liabilities"" this is another nonsensical point."
7/1/2021 13:41,stocks,Not sure what the point is of that copy/paste comment.  Just because it doesn‚Äôt have long term debt doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a good investment.
7/1/2021 13:08,stocks,"You‚Äôre wrong, they recently paid of all debts on hand. Not sure where you are getting your information from, you‚Äôre definitely not up to date, you didn‚Äôt even know they had a partnership with Microsoft. Damn. I was asking you what debts they had, you seem to think the stores are debts.."
7/1/2021 14:00,stocks,It means you‚Äôre wrong and you don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre talking about. Now comes another excuse of why you missed out on the dips
7/1/2021 13:33,stocks,"Bro, you literally called stores liabilities. Thats a debt.

I said you were wrong, stores are an asset. These are not opinions, these are textbook terms.

Go to fuckin yahoo finance and look at their balance sheet, and tell me if the 216 million they paid off covers ALL of their liabilities

Please explain what the Microsoft partnership accomplishes. What do you think it does?"

The last period where central banks pursued similar policy was after the 08 crash, if you look at the charts from this period the recovery was a bumpy road around a year after the we reached bottom there were fairly significant market corrections in most the U.S markets (Nasdaq, SP500 etc) of around 10% or over, and a similar trend a year after again! We‚Äôve had an unusually long bull run how much longer can this go on? Markets are at an all time high but the economy hasn‚Äôt even recovered yet. Long term macro we will of course see growth but at some point before the end of the year there will be a correction, what are your views on this?"

7/1/2021 9:56,stocks,"What are you talking about? Basically No one predicted the recovery and boom we have had. Not even the biggest perma bulls predicted this.

7/1/2021 9:48,stocks,I surely do.  They will announce a crash 2 weeks in advance.

7/1/2021 11:48,stocks,Entire markets and of course entire nations collapse all the time. It‚Äôs not inconceivable that the stock market could completely collapse. Another possibility that is far more likely than considered is a crash worse than the Great Depression that could take decades or a lifetime to recover from. Such a crash would take common stocks back to being considered a risky fringe investment vehicle like they were during and immediately after the Great Depression. The stock market is not the safe free money people think it is right now.

7/1/2021 0:00,stocks,"Investing Advice So since.last November.I have started to put my savings into stocks. At first I was playing around with lots of penny stocks and having an even number of wins and losses.

But now I feel I would like to invest my money in some company/ETFs that I can really set and forget and maybe put money into some riskier growth areas.

At the moment I have money in Apple, AMD, Microsoft be it very small positions.

Then I have some money in riskier stocks but ones I believe will be go up over the next few years and these are companies I do believe in. I canrlt name them or my post gets deleted.

I can afford to add a few hundred ¬£ each month but want that money to now go into less speculative stocks.

I've been reading on here and have heard people mention stocks like MU, AMAT and TSM.

ATM all my safe stocks are in tech companies but I would like to diversify and that's why I am looking for advice.

Many Thanks."

7/1/2021 11:10,stocks,"I personally like APPL, MSFT, and AMD, although only have stock in AAPL atm since I needed to liquidate MSFT shares for another investment. 

Overtime, you will gain more confidence and ability to identify individual companies, and I prefer them over ETF's since ETF's imo are the epitome of 'diworseification' the idea that too many random companies will result in an average return. 

Trust your instincts, but be careful to slowly scale up your risk tolerance overtime as your confidence slowly scales up. The worst thing to do in stocks is to outsmart yourself."

7/1/2021 19:06,stocks,"Im the opposite. Over time, i invest more in ETFs than individual stocks. 



Why? Because i become wiser and learn that people rarely outsmart the market. 


>	too many random companies will result in an average return.



Stock picking usually results in **lower than average returns**. The evidence for this is out there.



>	Trust your instincts, but be careful to slowly scale up your risk tolerance overtime as your confidence slowly scales up



Dont trust instincts/emotions, thats how you lose money. Trust logic and numbers."
7/1/2021 9:23,stocks,Are there any stocks in any specific sectors you'd recommend? So I can go and do my own research on them.
7/1/2021 10:27,stocks,"Lots of embedded value, SPARC warrents are a new concept on the market, no opportunity cost but rights to nav price for a future merger. I beleive in the team running the show, pershing square. If you were to buy now you would be getting on before the record date l (late july early aug), meaning you would receive umg shares (great value and growth), psthr shares ( a smaller spinoff spac that has an extended timeline), sparc warrents ( tradeable rights to a future, potentially 10 bil dollar, acquisition), and additional psthr warrents. There's a comprehensive breakdown on the daily discussion at r/psth.

The most tangible part of this at the moment is UMG. Universal music group is a behemoth in the industry with great potential for more growth. 

I sold a substantial portion of my shares recently after learning the rough timeline sothat I could get into a short term trade. I plan to fully reinvestin psth before the record date, hopefully with added capital."
7/1/2021 19:20,stocks,"If that works for you, then good on you for finding the investment an investment vehicle that suits you. 

I'm not 100% anti-ETF, I just like to bring balance to the discussion and remind people to review individual stocks in ETF's because some ETF's you might want to steer clear of if too many individual companies are no good."
7/1/2021 9:40,stocks,"You could invest in sector ETFs so it gives you exposure. e.g. xlf for financial.    
Ark has some funds doing some sectors e.g. arkf for finance.

It has stocks in buckets of each sector and sorted by size for the bigger ones.

Probably some good picks right now are energy, construction, finance, but I don't know personally.    
Energy should be up today as oil demand rising and price going up    
    
Regarding those you mention I'm in MU. It's selling off after earnings as CEO and others can sell openly now so often it creates pressure. but had a nice beat and future forecasts 10% above analyst expectations and I can see going to 90 in the next month personally with new price targets of 110-130 for the year."
7/1/2021 19:24,stocks,"Im not using myself as an example. Im using millions of data as an example.

The Shanghai-headquartered EV maker delivered 8,083 vehicles in June, up about 116% when compared with year-ago numbers, and also reported a 20.4% jump from May, when sales were hurt due to the volatile chip supplies.

This is the highest number of monthly deliveries posted by Nio ever.

EV pretty much has the same hype as cars had in the early 1900s when they first came out. Few manufacturers are still arround, very few in fact. Car stocks is too competitive and their margins are slim as f.

Imo if you're comparing NIO to any company other than Tesla you're comparing apples and oranges, hell NIO even steals Tesla's creative properties, rips their website, etc. Honda doesn't even have a till electric vehicle"
7/1/2021 14:06,stocks,"That's a flawed comparison though. You can't just compare units for units. If NIO were geared up to sell 5 million cars a year by 2030 but at much higher margins than Honda, it would make sense that people had started taking their money out of Honda and into NIO.

That said, that's clearly not the case here. NIO very well may sell 5 million cars a year by 2030, but I've seen nobody explain why they would be able to sell them at higher margins. Therefore, at best it would make sense for NIO to also be valued at 55 billion, minus 10-20 billion for the uncertainty of them having to prove that they can actually sell 5 million cars a year."

7/1/2021 10:18,stocks,"Then don‚Äôt invest in them. Don‚Äôt know what to tell you. They are legitimate competition and their shares haven‚Äôt even split, whereas companies like Ford that have been around forever have. $60 is going to be nothing in 10 years after the shares have split once or twice and the company is giving the EV market a run for their money since they are some of the first and only legitimate competition. That‚Äôs my opinion anyway"
7/1/2021 10:56,stocks,"Shares splitting does nothing. All that matters is market cap, and what percent of that you're buying.

If I had 200 bucks and put 100 in one pile and 100 in another I haven't created any value."
7/1/2021 14:09,stocks,"I'm genuinely trying to understand where the valuation comes from. All I'm getting in response are flawed arguments or people going 'tHeN dOn'T iNvEsT iN tHeM oMg1!"".

I very well would like the bull case for NIO to be true because I DO want to invest in them. Like I said, they seem like a great company long term. Just not at this valuation, unless someone can explain me what I'm missing.

Also, wtf do the stock price and stock splits have to do with anything? They're literally irrelevant for valuations and say nothing about a company. You think they're going from $90B market cap to a few hundred because ""$60 dollars isn't a high stock price?"" If that is your argumentation you really shouldn't be investing."
7/1/2021 12:26,stocks,I agree. But shares splitting is representative of all those things. It‚Äôs a quick way to point out how far along Ford is and that each of their $60 shares aren‚Äôt equivalent.
7/1/2021 14:12,stocks,"Look man. I'm not a perfect investor. This is how I'm looking at it and I was in at $1500 when shares were $32 and I'm doing really well with it and have high hopes for the future. Sounds like you've done your research and made your decision. So don't invest my man. Don't invest in companies you don't think are worth your time. I've been trading for just 3 years and I don't know everything nor am I claiming to.   


You're obviously getting heated about this and I'm sorry my advice isn't what you were looking for. Don't know what to tell you outside of that."
7/1/2021 14:18,stocks,"I'm the one getting heated? :'D

Again, I DO think NIO is worth my time. I'm just trying to figure out why people think it's worth $90 billion. To make sure there's nothing I'm missing.

So far all you've given back to me is ""I bought low"", ""I think the share price will increase"" and ""the company will do well in the future"". What are the fundamentals why you think this company is worth well over $50B (which is roughly where you bought in at)? 

> I'm doing really well with it and have high hopes for the future.

Hope isn't a strategy, and putting money into a stock based on hope doesn't make you an investor, it makes you a gambler. I just want to know why you think their profit margins and earnings will be high enough to justify a significantly higher valuation than $90B."
7/1/2021 0:00,stocks,"Looking at british petroleum. Confused on its name It's description is confusing me. On RH it states British petroleum for BP. Which is obv. But on tos, ticker BP says BP ADR sponsored. And on market watch it says BP PLC ADR.

They are all the same right? Why is it named differently?"
7/1/2021 5:51,stocks,"They are all the same. Officially the company is called BP plc with headquarters in London. So all shares of $BP are traded as ADR (American Deposit Receipt) on a 1:6 ADR ratio. This means for every 1 share of BP from the NYSE, represents 6 shares of BP on the LSE (London Stock Exchange).

tl:dr BP = BP ADR Sponsored = BP PLC ADR. Actual ticker is BP.:XLON or BPAQF:OTC Pink"
7/1/2021 8:25,stocks,"ADR is an American Depository Receipt, it is a certificate issued by a bank representing a specific # of shares. It allows foreign companies to be traded on US exchanges.

- Currently age 5, want to cash out when they are 18
- Purpose is to give them cash for use on life stuff, NOT college. They already have 529s and college will be fully funded. 
- I want higher risk than SPY or a fund that merely tracks 
- It‚Äôs about $10k to invest. 

Ideas

- ARKK - yes it‚Äôs been hammered but the high growth over 13 years HAS to be good right? 

- XLK - very FAANG heavy 

- something like ARKG where 13 years is enough time for genomics to really boom

- Would a consumer cyclicals like XLY grow enough? 

- Maybe iDrive?

7/1/2021 6:58,stocks,Their is a reason everything is compared to S&P. That being said you can set all kinds of fund accounts on Fidelity or others and select you level of risk for the investment. I would not ever put my money in arkk long term.

People saying not to invest right now due to ATHs are forgetting that even when buying at ATH then a crash happens you still, unless timed perfectly, will have gains.  You're investing for 13 years and not a short 6-12 months.  This shouldn't be a concern.  I also agree that you should go with a custodial account to prevent the gift tax.  You are allowed to gift a certain amount of money a year before it is taxed, but idk what that amount is.  Probably best to confirm with a tax advisor or googling your state tax laws along with federal.

7/1/2021 0:00,stocks,"Let's talk Oil I've been following SG ETC WTI +2x Daily Leveraged Collateralized (OIL2L.MI) for quite some time now, and I have noticed an interesting prospect. 

&#x200B;

The stock was created in 2017 and was priced at 47 Euros, which was the price of Oil at the time. 

During 2020 it was grouped at 1 to 100 when it was worth a fraction of the price due to the price of oil tanking over the pandemic. 

If the value of the stock is actually tied to the value of oil, today the stock should be worth 7800 euro, whereas the stock is trading at around 380. 

Would it be a good idea to invest, given the price is so much lower than its actual value?"
7/1/2021 5:47,stocks,"Ignore past performance, it‚Äôs irrelevant. It‚Äôs a leveraged fund. It is future WTI development that is meaningful to this stock performance.

The only reason to invest now in the fund is if you think WTI oil will continue to increase. If it does, you can expect that for around every 1% increase in WTI, this fund will grow by 2%. However, it‚Äôs also not usually recommended to hold leveraged funds for long periods due to time decay."
7/1/2021 7:59,stocks,Use a starting point of June 2020. When the oil prices had the big fluctuations early 2020 it crashed many of the ETFs/ ETCs. They didn't have the proper safety hedging in place. Most should have fixed that problem now.

I like to monitor it since I kinda know how the company works from the inside and it's interesting to match it to the ticker performance. Anyway, it was slowly growing this year until it reached $18. Then yesterday they've announced a stock offering of 10 million shares. Usually that decreases the stock price, and that happened indeed, there was a sharp drop to $15. Today they've announced the price of the offering, it's around $15 per share, so it seems that the market reacted correctly. Yet for some reason it caused the SP to spike almost 25% to $19. Why?

* \[...\] This trend is increasingly dividing the country by racial lines.

 it's a great company, comparable companies stocks are in the 150 range if not even higher, so I don't see any reason why it wont get there.

sometimes it has dips or gets stagnant for a while so if you're really concerned you can try to time it but I didn't buy more at $80 because I thought it would drop back down to the mid 70s and now it's at $94"

For some it‚Äôs a better long term investment to buy stocks in the clean energy sector they know they are going to hold for 20-30 years. I think a lot of the investors will shift out of oil and into clean energy in the next 10-20 years as oil loses more and more of the energy sector."
7/1/2021 12:42,stocks,"While I don't hate Cathie, that's definitely one that she got wrong.

She said ""she'd be surprised if she ever saw oil above $70 again"" and I randomly guessed that it'd be at $80 in the summer earlier in the year.

Having said that, there are too many people that are looking for $100 oil, so that is probably not going to happen, a lot like how TNX to 2% probably ends up not happening (at least in 2021, that is on this front)."

7/1/2021 12:58,stocks,"Fundstrat's Tom Lee said yesterday that he thinks AMZN could pop 20% before the end of the year.  

Long periods of consolidation on upward trending stocks almost always end with a large and abrupt movement upwards.  And considering what AMZN has done previously in these situations, coupled with its amazing earnings reports, theres no reason to think it wont do that."
7/1/2021 17:20,stocks,"1. Low volume is completely meaningless until it means something. I've seen crying about the volume for seemingly almost a year now. It's simply not meaningful at all though until a September 3rd, 2020 like day happens.

2. In the last 12 months, the S&P is 10 out of 12 on being green on jobs Friday. The first time where it was not happened during the fastest Nasdaq correction in history in September, and the second time was when Trump caught COVID.

There are a couple reasons why jobs Friday=higher could end up not playing out this time, but based off recent history, the lean should probably be toward it posting a 7th straight up day."
7/1/2021 17:21,stocks,"I am very bullish but stopped buying calls on Monday. Market has felt weird the past few days and I was surprised by the $2 increase today. Bought a few puts but should've stayed cash probably, I honestly have no idea"

7/1/2021 13:11,stocks,"Needless to say, if there's a dip on jobs Friday tomorrow, it'll be the first one I can remember happening outside of when that Nasdaq correction started in September.

Like, I wouldn't completely rule it out (a major miss could cause concern about wage inflation and a blowout could cause concern about tapering), but if you go by what's been happening, there probably won't be.

Edit: Well, there was one in October but I believe that day had another issue."
7/1/2021 10:09,stocks,"That's biotech trading.  Company dumps everything in a failed product or something with no promise, announces they're shifting their efforts into something with promise, several large holders announce a price target reduction that is still higher than the current price, everyone throws a party and the stock rises.  

Personally do not think ALT is worth much more than the current entry price short term.  Long term it is a pure gamble on a successful Phase 1/2 or licensing deal."
7/1/2021 11:55,stocks,"Using margin isn't a bad thing unless you abuse it (like a credit card).

Fidelity only offers a Reg-T (2x leverage) so using 50% buying power is equivalent to an unleveraged cash account.

You will receive a margin call *only if the total holdings exceed 2x the account value*.  When this happens you can either (a) deposit money, (b) sell a long holding, or (c) close a short position.

However margin can become expensive if your *cash available goes below zero and you need to borrow cash*.  These short term loans are roughly $3 daily interest per $10k borrowed.  

Again this only applies to accounts with a negative cash balances."

7/1/2021 18:24,stocks,"Market often over reacts. And then corrects itself.

The big fish sell off on news like this just to buy in lower. If you sell or your stop loss gets triggered you lose.

At this rate $3700 would be a miracle, and even at that level it‚Äôs a colossal disappointment.  The fact remains, every day and week and month that goes by proves me right about this stock.  Dead money, no momentum, huge disappointment."
7/1/2021 10:27,stocks,"Lol.  The fact that it‚Äôs still at the current level is a joke.  At this rate, even a 10% run won‚Äôt be nearly enough.  Not when you consider what you could have made in Google or Shopify or Nvidia or PayPal or Microsoft or countless others.  This has been a terrible investment.  You referencing downside protection, but failing to mention it has no upside momentum whatsoever.

You bought the stock after a massive rally of 70% and now youre pissed you missed out.  Thats whats actually going on here and its apparent to everyone.  Sell the stock on move on buddy.  You just look dumber and dumber every day you post complaining about it"

Be happy that you didn't lose your money and probably even made a little cause AMZN is close to ATH rn. That's why you don't invest all you money in one company. Every time people tell you to sell you have an excuse. Now you say you cannot sell because everything else is ATH. I told you to sell a few months ago when everything was cheap but you had another silly excuse that you cannot sell cause you're under water.... sure.

7/1/2021 10:48,stocks,"Again, misleading numbers.  Doesn‚Äôt take into account 6.2% in a month, 10.5% in the past 3, because it had sunk so much.  You always fail to mention that it hit its ATH in July of last year.  Then dropped over 10%.  Then ATH again a few months later, then down 12%, then ATH again a few months later, then down 10% again.  I believe it has hit $3500-ish 5 times now in 12 months, and immediately sunk afterwards.  So gaining 6.2% when you were already down 10% isn‚Äôt impressive."
7/1/2021 11:02,stocks,Purely speculative.  There is no legitimate source to suggest that a split is coming.

7/1/2021 11:00,stocks,"Don‚Äôt be greedy?  My expectation wasn‚Äôt 50% in a year, but certainly more than 7%.  I mean shit, my dividend ETF has given me more than that.  You guys always pivot when discussing Amazon‚Äôs current performance.  What I do or don‚Äôt do with my money is a separate topic.  Let‚Äôs stick to Amazon‚Äôs performance in the last 11 months.  It‚Äôs flat and highly volatile (mostly to the downside).  No one said a year ago that it would be this flat.  Numbers didn‚Äôt suggest it either.  Every earnings report is amazing, yet it drops hard immediately after.  Same with Prime Day.  On at least three occasions in the last year, the general consensus was that you needed to load up on more Amazon, because the next big run was imminent.  So the numbers are amazing, the forecast is amazing, and the general consensus is that it‚Äôs amazing.  Yet the result is pathetic."

7/1/2021 0:00,stocks,What is your thought on PSFE and SOFI? What is a better investment option? What is your thought on these two companies? What is the better option in investing and what‚Äôs your justification? Both of these companies are in financial sector with a promising outlook but which one stands out better?
7/1/2021 8:18,stocks,I own both but I have 10X the amount of SoFi vs PSFE.  SoFi has a way larger target market and has had positive EBITDA for the past 3 quarters in a row.  SoFi also has Galileo that gives them a strong B2B play as well that already has 70M accounts.
7/1/2021 12:09,stocks,"SOFI is down near the lower 2x stddev 20 day Bollinger band, so if you're investing short-term, it looks like a great buy."
7/1/2021 14:35,stocks,"SOFI was one of the rare SPACS that increased its value after the merger. The recent hype started after panic selling on PIPE lockup news dropped the price below $20, which is the same entry point I had been waiting on for a while. I'm guessing other people were waiting too since the price held firm despite heavy selling pressure.

PSFE has been the opposite. People forget PSFE was hyped hard after merger, and did nothing but lose value ever since aside from a week or two of random blips. Their guidance after earnings was poor and the market doesn't like the current outlook.

I had shares of PSFE at $14 and sold at $12-13 after seeing the writing on the wall although I made a lot selling cc when the IV was high. I hold a few hundred shares of SOFI and am not selling regardless of how low the price goes due to so many upcoming catalysts like earnings and the bank charter."
7/1/2021 17:50,stocks,SOFI will just have to go up.
7/1/2021 5:07,stocks,I'm riding in both plays.   Long term hold for me so I'm adding anytime it's below my average.  Long term 3-5 years

7/1/2021 14:31,stocks,"Then I would suggest looking at what SoFi HAS done, solid growth in successive quarters, profitable now, expanding user base, acquisition of Galileo, etc etc. It has catalysts on the near horizon as well, strong EBDITA.

The problem is the current prevalence of hard drugs, especially in the party scene combined with the illegality and criminality related to it. At most festivals and some clubs (especially dance / techno), you can actually get your XTC checked for free, and going to a festival, you can expect that most people will be using XTC. Lots of people sell it as well.

With the rise in prevalence of drugs, we‚Äôve seen a rise in more vicious criminality as well. Parties who are pro-legalising hard drugs argue that legalising it would decrease the amount of criminality related to it. Which is also the reasoning for why weed was legalized.

While the sale and usage of weed is legal, the cultivation is not. Shops are only allowed to have a very small inventory in their shop, and growing weed is not allowed‚Ä¶ so, where they buy their stuff is illegal.

It is definitely a very weird tolerance construction, and a difficult problem to solve.

7/1/2021 0:00,stocks,"The Bear Case for Summer: A crash in the next 4-8 weeks? Hello everyone. I present a bear case for the summer. 

I've noticed people beginning to think about the risk of an imminent crash lately on various finance and, uhh, stock-gambling subreddits. What stocks to buy in case there's a crash? Where is safe in a crash? That sort of thing. Take a look around, do some searches for 'crash' or 'bubble', you'll see it. A change in the mood. I track about 10+ finance forums every day, and I keep seeing it coming up every single day on daily threads and topic posts.

Of course, there are always people worrying about downside, the risks, and there are always people yelling the market is about to crash, perma-bears etc. ""Scared money don't make money"", and a stopped clock is right twice a day.  Why might this time be different? 

The backdrop
=====

The market is presently doing well following the idea of the 're-opening play' in addition to the free money fountain of central bank programs and government fiscal stimulus. However, I think the delta strain is going to prevent re-openings lasting more than a few weeks, and I think sentiment is going to turn sharply on that. 

Delta can often break past vaccines, unfortunately, and it spreads like absolute wildfire among the unvaccinated. Regardless, the EU and USA are opening up anyway! Given the R0 of 6 of delta, we should see very rapid spread when mask mandates, lockdown restrictions are removed, and people are socialising like crazy in the Summer of Hedonism. 

I would expect by end July to mid-August, delta will be causing very big problems pretty much everywhere in the world; it's established and spreading in 80+ countries already. Other strains are also a problem and we may see new variants of delta or entirely new strains showing up in the next 2-3 months. 

Do you think delta is the most deadly or infectious variant of covid we'll ever see? 

Consider: it's already about 2.5x faster spreading, more infectious in younger adults, more likely to cause symptomatic disease, new symptoms that can cause it to be misidentified, it has reduced the protectiveness of vaccines noticeably. If you look at the death/infections rate in covid-naive unvaccinated populations like Taiwan, it's potentially a lot more lethal too. That's how much covid 'improved' itself in the 12 months that constituted the bulk of its spread so far, and right now it's spreading (and getting lottery tickets to improve itself) in more people than ever. 

If it's not rapidly eliminated and has another 12 months to circulate, mutate, and continue getting stronger and work around vaccine antibodies, how bad might it become? Are state & national governments in the EU & US & Japan etc taking actions that would eliminate covid before it gets any stronger, or taking actions that will likely allow it to continue to spread and develop?

The Bear Case
=====

My key argument: Central bank and government stimulus programs were timed and globally synchronised on the assumption of the re-opening play throughout this summer. Taxpayer funds and central bank willingness/effectiveness may be exhausted should this continue another year - or two. Does anyone think life around the world will be back to 'business as usual' by the end of summer? Or will it be still 'the end of the beginning' as delta begins to reach the people that alpha failed to reach? The liquidity trap for central banks is also a real concern as printing continues and rates stay close to zero, added to uncertainty about the security of income in many sectors. 

The number of doses of vaccine given worldwide is about 2 billion. The number of doses required to fully vaccinate the world just once is about 16 billion. Will covid continue to circulate and improve? What about new animal strains (remember the mink in Denmark?). What will happen to the stockmarkets and consumer demand in emerging markets with low levels of vaccination? 

Even if covid magically disappeared overnight in the developed world - and it won't - how can the US & EU stockmarkets do well if most of the world is still being ruined by covid and new dangerous strains continue to emerge? 

Now consider: A CAPE10 PER of 38? - 38! good lord! (https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) - Government debts globally hitting dangerously high levels vs GDP in most developed countries? A struggling global supply chain? Stalled, chaotic re-opening plans? This re-opening can't afford to fail, but as delta arrives perfectly timed with summer re-openings and incomplete vaccination, how can it succeed? 

The world is already struggling where delta is well established this month.  https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/weekly-trends/#weekly_table . Some countries where delta is well established already: Russia, Indonesia, Bangladesh. Some countries with highly successful vaccination programs: United Kingdom, Israel, Seychelles. Sort by 'weekly case change' or 'weekly death change', ignore the small countries. Those are 'weekly' figures. Extrapolate out 6-8 weeks. 

For discussion: What do you think is going to happen here? How do you think governments will respond? How do you think the market will respond? 

Other examples
====

Consider: Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, China, New Zealand, were successful in holding back covid for 15 months. But delta sneaked past all their defenses. Now they are engaged in various levels of restrictions to try and stop it. If they can't keep it under control, how are countries with low rates of vaccination and limited/nonexistent restrictions ever going to manage? 

And then we get into the economic costs of continuing to push hard on burned out healthcare systems, the economic costs of long covid, the economic costs of permanent damage to economies  (businesses that went bust and won't ever re-open - hospitality, tourism etc). A lot of businesses can survive a bad year. But it's been 18 months now struggling like this. How many of these businesses can survive 2, maybe 3 terrible years? How much of the economy can we afford to lose before we have a really serious crisis on our hands or permanent economic damage?

Too much like feb 2020
======

To me the whole situation today rhymes far too much with the sentiment and backdrop in February 2020. A deadly strain spreading. Market hitting new highs. Too many big countries not taking it seriously, Asia & ANZ making a serious desperate attempt to stop it spiralling out of control.

The main difference with the February 2020 scenario? We're starting from a far, far, far higher point of stockmarket valuation (the SP500 is not just 'expensive', it's at the 2nd highest point of valuation ever, per CAPE10, and the highest ever in terms of broker margin, buffett ratio). 

The investor backdrop is bubbling hyper-bullish sentiment and outright gambling on most forums, manias and pump/dumps erupting multiple times a day, and bearly [!] an inkling of bearishness. Yet we're going forward from here with companies AND consumers AND governments AND central banks that have taken a balance-sheet beating for the last 15 months. We're looking at a far more deadly strain of disease that spreads faster, hits harder. We're looking at governments that have already burned out the political support and willingness-to-suffer of their populations.

This is not a recipe for success. This is a recipe for March 2020... on steroids. 

Some counter-arguments against my case
=========

> ""The vaccines are effective and will bring covid to a halt"". 

By definition, disease with a natural R>3 will continue to circulate even if vaccines are 66% effective against infection and 100% of the population is fully vaccinated. Contrast: The R of delta is around 6, the effectiveness of one of the best vaccines (AZN) is around 60%, and barely a handful of countries will have fully-vaccinated rates above 50% by the end of summer. 

> ""Well, OK, vaccines won't stop it, but they will stop people dying of it. That's what matters. We don't lockdown for 20000 flu deaths/year.""

What we are seeing from delta is that AZN & PFE/MDNA vaccines are **extremely** effective at preventing death generally, though less so in older people or immunocompromised people. I have read that a fully vaccinated 80 y/o has about the same chances vs covid as an unvaccinated 50 y/o, but I don't have the source to hand right now; sounds about right though. 

Vaccines aren't nearly so effective at stopping someone spreading covid to vulnerable members of their family. While vaccines have a wonderful effect in reducing hospitalisations too, delta hits hard and spreads fast, so hospitals are already beginning to get quite busy again as a result. The problem is that this means regular hospital operation is going to be affected. If you have a hospital full of ultra-hyper-contagious-but-not-deadly plague, you can't be doing regular surgeries etc. So people will unfortunately die from that, from delayed surgeries etc, specialities on hold to help out in the covid wards. Flu has an R around 1.5 and it slams the hospital system hard every year. An ongoing (and worsening into the end of the year) slamming of the hospital system with a mostly-non-lethal-but-still-needs-oxygen/vent disease, that spreads between wards with an R of 6, that is a different matter. There's also the issue that e.g. teachers, retail, dentists, doctors, hospital staff are simply exhausted and emotionally burned out from dealing with this. The systems are under a huge amount of pressure as it is even today. It isn't realistic to expect governments to keep saying 'tough shit', all the public 'ignoring' covid all around, while these sectors crumble under the pressure.   

> ""Regardless of whether it spreads, or whether people are dying, no matter how bad it gets, governments will simply not lock down again. End of story.""

We saw in Sweden last year that if governments fail to enact a lockdown, a large part of the public will do it themselves anyway. And many businesses cannot operate at full productivity if workers keep falling ill and ending up long-term sick or in hospital, even if those workers remain alive. Many businesses cannot profitably operate on 30-50% custom. Ultimately, democratic governments cannot force you to go out and get slammed by a deadly plague providing you have enough money in the bank to avoid it. The retail & hospitality economy will not prosper if the only people out shopping/eating/holidaying are those unable to afford the luxury of hiding at home from a massive covid outbreak.

Random things

Remember, whether it's 1987 or 2020, you don't get a warning before the rug gets pulled from under your feet. A trip down memory lane. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ES4uVEcXsAEqZkT?format=jpg&name=4096x4096 . https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51829852 . Not that long ago, really?

Also - ""Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy"", the sage wrote. But what does **greedy** look like? Does it look like 'my stock is worth $1m/share'? No. **Greedy** looks like this: smart, sensible, sane people saying things like 'well OK, sure this market seems pretty weird, idiots being stupid, but the music's still playing, and I think there's still time to skim a quick 5-10% and get out before it all falls apart. There will be a bit of warning before shit hits the fan; I'll run for the exit when I see it'. 

The steamroller has arrived, it is right there, towering over them, but still their eyes are on the pennies on the ground, even though they know they ought to know better. But it hasn't started squishing ... yet. Then the moment arrives, and the door for everyone to get out is...  so very narrow. Painfully mixed metaphors but you see my point. 

Finally

Disclosure; I am now completely out of the market.

Some further material for thought:  https://www.gmo.com/europe/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/

A closing note: every day, the next major stockmarket crash always gets one day closer. It's like the theta decay on a long-dated option whose expiry date is a secret. Hardly there at all for months or years, the signal lost in the noise, then suddenly, it arrives, it's the day, and everything is gone at once. 

Stay safe everyone, get your vaccines, and don't catch the plague. The zero-th rule of making money is: be alive to enjoy it.

p.s. If you think what I've written is wrong/stupid fair enough but  don't downvote this purely because you are currently long in the market and don't like seeing bearish sentiment. I would very much welcome thoughtful & evidence-based criticism of what I'm presenting here. I would love to be wrong about this."

People will just live there lives spending money at this point and everybody will either get exposed and develope antibodies or they'll die, but people are going to go out to beaches, restaurants, sporting events and concerts regardless. There's no way people will tolerate another lockdown in my opinion. Even the governments seem over it. Overall the next 3 or 4 quarters will be steadily up, until rates start getting more and more talked about getting tweaked.

I have hedged against the moratorium ending in the United States tho. I'm targeting commercial real estate puts prioritizing small and mid caps. Mostly puts around a November expiration at give or take -7%."

7/1/2021 19:37,stocks,If you don‚Äôt know when or why then this is useless. I think the world will end. Don‚Äôt know when but someday it will.
7/1/2021 4:59,stocks,I completely agree.

7/1/2021 18:57,stocks,"you're taking it out of context. OP implies that a warning would be a clear crash signal which you trust enough to act on. It doesn't matter who the source of the warning is -- the point is, if you think you have a comfortable amount of time to skim profits before the alarm goes off, you probably will get fucked"
7/1/2021 14:00,stocks,Indubitably
7/1/2021 13:27,stocks,How can you say that?!! You will only survive with a 99.999% survival rate (if you‚Äôre below 50). Don‚Äôt you care about the risk?
7/1/2021 4:24,stocks,"Well, let's see. The only thing that might moon the market is the idea of stimulus and low rates. But rates are already low and stimulus has been stimmied to the point of a liquidity trap beckoning. Meanwhile, entire sectors are going to be obliterated if we get another year or two of this. How is the market going up if whole sectors get wiped? I don't see it.

I want an argument and something to go with it - a model, some history - not 'X will happen because I want X'."
7/1/2021 5:59,stocks,"> We have a tech/hype stock bubble like 2000

cant think of any big tech name that didn't have blowout numbers and have fantastic guidance

>We have a housing/debt bubble like 2008 

just because houses have gone up in value doesnt mean its a bubble lmao. inflation has literally gone up

>We have a covid crisis newly evolving like March 2020

we definitely don't. this is just a straight out lie lmao. and the reason why the market crashed in 2020 was because of uncertainty. the government was completely blindsided from covid and had no idea what to do. companies had no idea what the fuck were going to happen so everyone sold in fear. if theoretically everything happened again, the market wouldn't care because having literally experienced this a year ago, the government would be able to take effective action with its newly gained experience

>We have a general mania like 1929

if every media outlet for the past year has been saying we're going to crash guys! next week is the week!, i wouldn't necessarily say everyone is too bullish"
7/1/2021 6:25,stocks,"We don‚Äôt have a tech bubble like 2000. Not even close. Tech is too expensive in my opinion but it‚Äôs not on the same level as 2000. 

And the COVID delta is pretty speculative still. 

What we do have is massive fiscal and monetary stimulus. This is more like to cause asset price inflation than a crash, isn‚Äôt it? Isn‚Äôt there a huge risk in being in cash and watching runaway inflation eat away your cash, while inflation causes share prices to skyrocket?

Just playing devil‚Äôs advocate. I look at the CAPE10 and it scares the shit out of me‚Ä¶"
7/1/2021 5:03,stocks,"The Stock market at this point will only react to what the Fed will do. That is the dominant topic at wallstreet. 

Furthermore: Tech is, in opposition to 2000, not a bubble. The top tech companies, which make most of NASDAQs weight, have substantial business now and are valued high, but not insanely. 

Housing is driven by interest rates and bought by institutional investors, such as REITs. no bubble here. 

Covid is not the narrative. Wallstreet anticipates the end of the pandemic and the reopening story. 

My thesis is that we will have a 10 to 15 % at max correction anywhere near the future, but nothing serious. Also, its hard to predict the time, so I will keep some cash to get in cheap when it happens."
7/1/2021 7:43,stocks,"The Nasdaq had a pe of 175 in 2000 when interests rates were also much higher. Doesn‚Äôt seem equivalent.

7/1/2021 5:12,stocks,"Thank you for stimulating this discussion. I believe we‚Äôre all moving past covid a bit prematurely. That said, the science points to a more controlled endemic as it pertains to the delta variant. Not ideal, but from my amateur understanding will levy much less shock to all markets relative to the COVID-19 pandemic, due to less market disruption as we RE-chart previously uncharted waters with a less indomitable adversary (given the existence of a vaccination that is very effective against variants and the global ‚Äúreadiness‚Äù for another outbreak). We will hopefully be able and more willing to adapt to safety protocol etc after the pandemic). If we assume that the overpriced sectors you mention are indeed that then a correction will occur regardless. But i believe market participants will react with less risk aversion if delta grows compared to the pure shock and uncertainty in 02/20. I agree with you that the worst case scenario is very bad. From what I‚Äôve read though it still seems draconian. And yes, if the worst case proves true, we‚Äôre pretty fuckd."

7/1/2021 9:51,stocks,The whole point of locking down was to give relief to hospitals. Since the vaccinated population don't clog up the hospitals there's pretty much no reason for another lockdown anyways.
7/1/2021 16:29,stocks,"I think any major steps toward a ""lockdown"" - curfews, capacity restrictions for businesses, masks for vaccinated its done. Civil unrest will dwarf what we've already seen. Therefore, I don't think lockdowns we've seen are coming back, unless hospitals are on the brink of being over run - which seems unlikely in the US."
7/1/2021 19:36,stocks,"that is taking the situation at face value. he explained what he sees between the lines, if you don't see it then you don't see it. 

min wage growth is happening quickly, and people are also voluntarily leaving the workforce. fast wage raises = less hiring to save money and small businesses suffer, leading to sustained unemployment when these people finally try to go get a new job because no one can afford to hire

economy is superficially improving, done so by money printers going full blast and adding to debt and budget deficits. 

FED already bumped the date up once, some people including myself are thinking it comes 2022 rather than 23. 

housing market is overpriced to these younger families because boomers are driving the price up, also many people with student loans are ineligible for mortgages due to debt-to-asset ratio, and the renting market isn't doing much better, and lumber is insanely overvalued. my neighborhood decreased in value by $3k/house on avg over the past month after 25k jump on avg in prices, so could be the start of the end imo. 

even with vaccines, the delta variant could and probably will still lead to shutdowns on some level. 

When the gov't stops stimulating retail and individuals and starts bailing out only big banks and businesses, that's when the money dries up for families and they stop spending, and possibly default on their debts.

I do agree the market itself will probably be fine until rate hikes, but insiders will know first. Insiders always know first."

7/1/2021 9:54,stocks,"Yep. Can't time the market. Imagine pulling out early this year and missing out on 15% gains

I also don't think we will ever see a long term bear market. The American retirement system now consists of the workforce passively contributing to the stock market every paycheck. 

Not financial advice"

7/1/2021 10:26,stocks,"Housing isn't fully an inflation thing. It's a supply demand thing more than anything. Minor correction seems quite possible there, but certainly not '08 situation. 

In addition, as interest rates rise it will slow the housing markets. People buy what they can afford for monthly payments. I don't think that's a ""crash"" situation, more like nerfed future appreciation for a while. I wouldn't be surprised to see housing prices as a whole stagnant for a few years, as the interest rate rise will offset inflation of fed does it right.

Some of the runup is certainly inflation, as you correctly identified."

I agree here though. That's my entire point. It's a load of cobblers."
7/1/2021 5:14,stocks,"> That said, the science points to a more controlled endemic as it pertains to the delta variant.

Are you looking at worldometer's coronavirus stats?

50% weekly growth in multiple massive countries with working vaccines is not controlled! That's how you get your economy zeroed out. Last year at this time covid practically disappeared. Now it's gone hyper-exponential compared to the worst part of last year; the only thing masking that is a low starting point.

Belgium, Indonesia, Bangladesh, South Africa, Mexico, Thailand, Tunisia, Cuba, Myanmar, Mozambique, Zimbabwe.

And most worrying; UK, Israel. Wait till you see Delta set in, in 2-3 weeks time, in the EU and USA. It is going to be an absolute SHIT SHOW.

The market broadly is on a CAPE10 of 38. That's the second highest in all of history.

Popular investing platform Robinhood has agreed to pay nearly $70 million to the financial industry regulatory authority (FINRA) to settle allegations that the brokerage caused customers ‚Äúwidespread and significant‚Äù harm on multiple different fronts over the past few years. That is the largest financial penalty ever ordered by the organization, a non-government entity authorized by Congress to oversee hundreds of thousands of brokers across the U.S. Specifically, FINRA‚Äôs investigation found that millions of customers received false or misleading information from Robinhood on a variety of issues, including how much money customers had in their accounts, whether they could place trades on margin and more.

The inaccurate information cost customers more than $7 million, FINRA found, and Robinhood is required to pay restitution to affected users. Other allegations addressed in the settlement include that Robinhood approved risky options trades for thousands of users when it should not have and did not do enough to prevent system outages in March 2020 that adversely affected millions of users. Robinhood has invested in improving the platform and is building out its customer service team, Robinhood spokesperson Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay writes to CNBC Make It in an emailed statement about the settlement.

‚ÄúWe are glad to put this matter behind us and look forward to continuing to focus on our customers and democratizing finance for all,‚Äù she says. Robinhood was launched in 2014 and attracted millions of customers, many of them first-time investors, with its easy-to-use app and industry-changing commission-free trades. But it has come under fire multiple times in the past few years, most recently during the GameStop rally earlier this year when it restricted trading. FINRA‚Äôs investigation found that Robinhood‚Äôs customer service issues go back much further. Between 2018 and 2020, for example, Robinhood failed to report tens of thousands of customer complaints to FINRA that it was required to report, the organization says.

FINRA also alleges that Robinhood has ‚Äúnegligently communicated false and misleading information‚Äù at different times since September 2016. Those misleading and false statements had hurt customers financially, FINRA found. The report also referenced the tragic story of a customer with details matching that of 20-year-old Alex Kearns, an investor who died by suicide in June 2020 after Robinhood showed a negative cash balance of $720,000 in his account. FINRA found that his balance was inaccurate, and that the value of his position was half of what the account displayed. While Robinhood has offered options trading since December 2017, FINRA says it has ‚Äúfailed to exercise due diligence before approving customers to place options trades,‚Äù relying on algorithms, rather than people, to approve customers for the risky investing move.

‚ÄúAs a result, Robinhood approved thousands of customers for options trading who either did not satisfy the firm‚Äôs eligibility criteria or whose accounts contained red flags indicating that options trading may not have been appropriate for them,‚Äù FINRA writes. Finally, the company failed to supervise the technology it uses to provide its core services between January 2018 and February 2021, resulting in a series of outages and systems failures. One of these outages occurred on March 2 and March 3, 2020, during extreme market volatility. FINRA says these outages cost certain individual customers tens of thousands of dollars. Robinhood did not admit nor deny the charges, and it still under investigation by the SEC. On Wednesday, the company published a blog post to highlight the changes it has implemented to address customer concerns."

I hate to say it but real brokerages will make you know they're a real brokerage.

They're practically anti-dividend, don't support any type of IRA, report completely false stock metrics pretty often (this is \*bad\*), and offer almost no research that isn't from Morningstar... you can't put real money into a company like that.   


What bites me, is I defended them for a little while. How does a brokerage not know what a REIT is? Isn't that scary? How can they misreport stock metrics like it's no big deal? No phone number?

7/1/2021 7:41,stocks,"First off,








>Robinhood users and force-sold their GME shares?





I have never seen anyone back this up on Reddit or otherwise. A Verge article that talks to a total of 1 person doesn't prove anything. Also, closing a trader's positions if they are using margin or implementing a strange option strategy is common practice by every single broker when markets get crazy. It is allowed and not illegal in any way. If they sold off actual shares and there was actual evidence of it happening to people then you may have an argument.







Second, 





>are you unaware that Robinhood turned off the buy button for Robinhood users









This also isn't illegal. And, Robinhood literally had to do this due to not being able to meet the new margin requirements set by the DTCC hours prior. Legally, all brokerages must clear their trades through a clearinghouse. So, either Robinhood breaks the law and doesn't clear their trades or it has to stop people from buying to lower the requirements. Pretty obvious choice and easily the right thing to do.






The point of the clearinghouse is to secure both sides of the trade. If a brokerage doesn't use a clearinghouse then there is a risk of you buying/selling a stock and getting nothing in return if the counterparty can't complete their side of the trade."

That doesn't matter at all. DTCC margin requirements aren't going to change based on who is doing the clearing. 








>Many other self-clearing firms (e.g. Fidelity and Vanguard) must have also been given the new collateral requirements from DTCC, yet they did not restrict GME or AMC buys.








Because collateral requirements are specific each brokerage based on the DTCC's risk calculations and the trades being done on each specific brokerage. If Robinhood's userbase was more active in trading GME and the other meme stocks during this period then the percent increase in the collateral requirement would reflect that and be much higher than other brokerages.






Robinhood had cash on hand for any potential increases in colleterial. They just didn't have 10x the typical requirement. And why would they? This type of increase in collateral is exceedingly rare and most brokerages probably haven't ever faced it."

TL;DR tickers: TSLA, ARKX, ROKT, UFO, INTEQ, IRDM, ASTS

We can‚Äôt invest in Starlink, and I wish we could. I‚Äôm looking for stocks & ETFs to benefit from Starlink and Starship. I am holding $TSLA IPO, and that‚Äôs good stuff.

First the ETFs. $ARKX. Kind of some out of the box choices, but it is clearly built around Starship being a big deal in coming years. Space will be much cheaper. I also have $ROKT & $UFO. Those aren‚Äôt geared around Starlink, but I want to own space stocks.

$GOGO. They sold their commercial aviation division to Iridium ($INTEQ.) The bankruptcy court approved INTEQ buying the division. I bought some INTEQ on the cheap, even though I know better than to buy a stock while in bankruptcy. (INTEQ is a huge government and military space server provider with lots of assets in orbit, btw.) Anyway, GOGO now only services private jets.  With no space assets and a dominant position for cell data, they could greatly benefit from Starlink.

While looking for Starlink plays, I found some stocks that seem to be outside of the reach of Starlink.

$IRDM. Iridium does old school sat phones. Pretty amazing for data emergencies if you are at sea or hiking on a mountain. These are places Starlink cannot cover well.

$ASTS. These cats are trying to send normal cell signals from satellites. Best I can tell, the tech looks legit. If it works, it will be very valuable. In fact, it will kill $IRDM, probably. I do not know if it will work, so this is a gamble. Worth the gamble, I think.

If you saw someone saying 'yeah there's a steamroller coming but I've still got time to pick up all these pennies on the street in front of it' you wouldn't say they were fearful. You would say they were insanely greedy.

If these people were 'fearful' they'd be dumping their stocks at any price and buying puts. But they're buying calls and yolo-ing into the dumbest stuff you can imagine.

Not only that, if you waited for the crash and there is one, getting in at the bottom is almost impossible to make it worth it. Buy high quality stocks. If there is a crash, add more to them. No use in worrying if there going to be a crash or when. I‚Äôve been hearing about a crash since 2011 when markets recovered from the financial crisis. I do think that the speculative market is going to crash but not the stock market any time soon. The crashes happen when it‚Äôs least expected.

Physical removal during evictions, like in 08, are still done by police right?

Doesn't seem evil they are training an eviction squad while sheep clothing a last month help extension on evictions? 

Major indexes have taken a hit, banks are going insolvent? (Credit suisse)

Major whales like Blackrock are guarding against inflation wildly with massive property buying in Canada and the US AT 15% above asking? (Back to RRPs)

New financial laws being implemented every week after years of nothing?

Even Warren buffet took out puts on treasury bonds (our central collateral system now) because of massive bond and etf shorting?

If those seem like the signs of a healthy economy to you, then idk what to tell you

But hey, POTUS had an important meeting with the treasury, sec and other financial high members, very all of a sudden, and said ""our economy is strong"", im sure anyone who survived 08 knows what that means

So be greedy if you want, why not?

Massive inflation knocking, market crash looming, corporate housing over leveraged, and junk bonds with etfs massively shorted... gotta try to survive somehow right?"

Dotcom surge took hundreds of companies along for a multiyear ride that involved hundreds of billions if not trillions (when you include private investment rounds, ipo's, and the peripheral moves in s&p and Dow higher over the same period).  The SPAC trend was getting a lot closer to this mania than the hype/meme stock move.   

Housing itself is getting too hit, but do we have 30 years of increasing volumes if mbs products and cdo build up that is about to totter over.  It is certainly likely rising, but I doubt it has reached systemic (insurance and reinsurance company levels for potential trillion dollar of balance sheet holes)."
7/1/2021 19:00,stocks,"Don't forget due to inflation there are rising wages en masse. Just got a job for $14/hr, $15 after 90 days when normal pay is $12, because of voluntary workforce exodus. 

Sure, large businesses can keep up. They can raise wages, cut a few positions, and barely raise costs, match inflation. Small businesses, who nearly went under from first pandemic, cannot afford wage raises without cutting more positions than viable, or raising prices to the point no one wants to pay. Then, we get deflation and lay-offs on smaller scales. Deflation hurts big corp pockets, so then they start laying off too, since they can't lower wages or raise prices. 

With the mortgage rates, second mortgages/vacation homes are at all-time highs, so when these layoffs come, how soon do the defaults on debt start? 

Unless gov't steps in and breaks the knobs on those money printers to keep em spewing 24/7 to bail out the economy, which will just contribute to more debt and taxes and such, I don't see a pretty ending to this situation.

On top of: possible second wave of pandemic and the dismissive attitudes of the people who matter. ""We have the foresight, hindsight, and general knowledge of economy to prevent such a major depression from occuring again"" seems like ignorance to me, ignoring the very real possibility that they don't know what the fuck they're doing and just going ""this seems like the best choice"" it is still a new situation, new circumstance, something not experienced in this way, and people are saying we know how to prevent it from getting worse?? Sounds like pouring random fluids on a fire and hoping one is water.

To be fair, I'm bullish in general and don't see anything major developing til mid 2022 when I expect rates to rise, I don't like feeling like a ""doomsdayer"" and I'm not saying a crash is imminent, it just seems like it is a very real probability that people are underestimating.

I think it would be worse than 2008, but not worse than the great depression. My bearish TA view on DJI is correction June 2022, bottom 2025, recovery 2027."
7/1/2021 15:07,stocks,"Yes, that is certainly one way of viewing things.  To be honest, I think the unfettered anything goes markets of the 1980s through 2000s are the culprits.   Too many future years of income were pulled forward while selling the benefits of just in time supply chains to reduce costs and gutting the productive capacity of the economy through offshoring and outsourcing to lower costs as ways to boost earnings and justify the higher valuations.   Then, the higher valuations necessitate, and are built upon, liquidation tactics and business plans to turn a profit.  

Technological change has played a large role as well.  Think of just one example-- moving from LPs to tapes to Cds then to mp3 players.  The three former all required basic materials and manufacturing for production, stores and sales people,  transportation jobs for moving to stores, and furniture at home for storage.  The manufacturing required machines/tools/consumables/maintenance, which all in turn had their own networks and needs. Vinyl, cardboard, plastic, resins, paper, artwork, and (shrinking) liner notes all turned into a download.  Enormous amounts of production, transportation, and sales jobs/infrastructure/capacity wiped out.   

You do the same to 100 other businesses and you have hollowed out the economy.  Think about all the capacity surrounding camera and film that has been wiped out-- plastics, chemicals, packaging, papers, developing companies, photobooks and storage, etc.    Initially the benefit was that it was cheaper, less materialistic, less bulky, more portable.  Then, just cost-- look at how cheap it is to stream instead of buy.  It is cheap.  It has to be-- wages across the country have not moved in nearly a decade.  And why should they?  Inflation has been low because of technology-- the technology that cuts your expenses has capped your wages as well.    

I AM NOT saying the old ways were ""better"" or should be brought back.   I am just calling attention to how much employment and production there used to be when download and streaming companies were not trillion dollar enterprises and millions were employed at living wage and better with multiple employer paid benefits.  We had millions of people producing tangible, exportable, goods.  Now we make sandwiches, clean hotel rooms, and wait tables as a ""core"" section of the economy, for less than living wages. 

Oh well.  I am sure the buggy and wagon manufacturers felt the same too.  It just seems like they actually had a boom of jobs and opportunities on the horizon.  We are steadily reducing ours."

Mass run away inflation wipes out debt fueled commodity debt anyway

The trick is not to over leverage so much that you get repossessed.  The trick is to maintain those commodities and assets after and through whatever crash while having your debt wiped out.   It's the poor man's guide cheat code.  Most if not almost always it doesn't work .. but if it actually happens and you make it work, well that's a hell of a cheat code"
7/1/2021 8:35,stocks,"That part makes sense, I will give you that, however it is incredibly unlikely debt will ever be wiped out en masse outside of widespread bankruptcies and asset seizures.  Inflation will help you pay down your debt over time, but a crash like this would be the most deflationary event to ever occur. 

  It is hard to get past him saying the reason there will be crash is because of huge amounts of debt, ie debt is the root of our current/future demise.  Then to quickly add that he has always been heavily leveraged and does not see the point of people wanting a debt free life.   If that is beneficial, the benefits come to a halt in a deflationary crash.  You might have your debts cleared in a bankruptcy, but where would your customers and income come from on these assets if the entire system just experienced the worst crash in this history of the world?  You will be in the soup line like everyone else because.

Two separate lines of thought, and two different timelines (pre and post crash), that do not line up."

Take the remaining 44k and put it into a different account and buy the aristocrats....companies that have a stellar record with paying their dividends and going up....Microsoft is on that list.  Every year transfer the max contribution for your Roth.  The dividends will compound your growth and allow you to buy other shares.  Inside the Roth buy REITs (real estate investment trusts). They pay dividends at higher rates and do so monthly.  Again you will never pay taxes on this money and it will be there for retirement.

What about a bunch of media companies like Viacom getting their cables cut right under their noses?  Invest in companies that will continue to innovate and last until you‚Äôre 70.  The ones you picked are far better than the average S&P 500 company, and their valuations are all reasonable.  I would bet my life Microsoft outperforms the S&P 500 for the next 20 years (won‚Äôt be hard to do either, 8-9% is so much lower than Microsoft‚Äôs long term earnings growth potential).

Whatever you do, don‚Äôt look for big dividends now.  Dividend stocks are for retired people looking for fixed income - means the company has thrown in the towel in trying to redeploy capital for growth and thinks it‚Äôs better off giving it back to shareholders.  You‚Äôre too young of a shareholder to invest in these types of companies.

Think about what products you love and cannot live without, and what product people 20-30 years from now won‚Äôt be able to live without.

Personally, I‚Äôm a huge fan of companies like Unity that will be crucial in 20 years when VR is a huge part of our daily lives, or companies like Lemonade that‚Äôs upending an old industry, or companies like Shopify that‚Äôs the best in its class in an industry with unlimited TAM."

TL;DR GME is on sale, and it's looking like a potential run up to 1200 as it's baseline, on fundamentals alone.

BMY was on sale earlier, but I exited my position at 67 for gme shares and SOFI calls.

The dividend stock becomes like a wife, or husband.  Maybe you're not acting an A$$, out at the Roxburry, each night anymore, YET at least you lie down decently at night, next to your spouse, or significant other, and you know who the heck you are, or are not, with the morning light!

Brittish American Tobacco(BTI), ORC, OCCI, OXLC, HTGC, or my all time favorite, CLM.  GLO, GLQ, and GLV, or the Clough Closed End Funds, have super discounts, as their share prices hover below their Net Asset Values, which equals sweet highway robbery to closed end fund management company junkies.  Other good divs are: T; IBM; Broadcom; INTC; WELL; PEAK; MAA; SUI: SAN; NHI; O; STAG; ECC; NMFC; PSEC; ANLY; AGNC; PSEC; Pennymac; MIC; BRK.B; Brookfield; MAC; SPG; and if AIV ever cooks up their dividend again.

Crypto is NOT for me.  I hate the tax issues, and if I ever did it I would hold it long, like for years, possibly decades, since taxes $UCK.  These whippersnappers have this naive, vague, unsyllogistic, view, like Capin' Jack, or whatever, that they can just hack an oilfield pipeline, a turkey factory, whatever, and just get away with it by tracing crypto, as what they stupidly see as some 'anonymous drug payment system,' which is anything but.

They have never heard the term, 'block chain.'  Duhhhhhhh?  It is a friggin chain, people.  And its a taxable one, at that.  Crypto is BLOCKCHAIN.  IT is NOT anonymous.  If you want to do a crime, and get paid, get paid trans via a cash stacks jam packed briefcase somewhere, or get paid in gold bars, copper, silver, or paladium.  Don't get paid in crypto, since it is a chain, a chain that can be certainly traced via the 'block chain.'  If the IRS can trace it don't think their cousins, the FBI, CIA, or NSA, have no ability to.

REIT stocks, and closed end funds(CEFs), or closed end management companies, sound like they'd be matches made in Heaven for you.

If you want a blindfold go Growth, Momentum, EV, or Meme stock.  Or, throw it into crypto, like Ethereum, and forgot you even knew about it.  If you jump off the crypto high dive, then stay in it.  Don't sell.  Don't sell until you have well enough to pay a long-term gains tax on your crypto profits.

Hey, at least if it goes down, or just stays level, which Div stocks have Not been doing as of late(they've been going UP under Biden), you still get your dividend, quarterly, or monthly.  That's enough money that the DIV could pay a rent, pay some bills, or just buy some groceries, or fund some decent partying at home, for goodness sakes!

50K is a sweet A$$ed monthly, Or even quarterly, Gividend, if you stop to scratch your head and think about it for a sec.

See, all these young, crypto, whippersnappers have no foggy clue that each time they buy, and then sell, crypto at a profit, they therefore incur a short-term capital gain, and that that is taxed.  The level it is taxed depends upon their income level.  Now, if they hold the crypto for at least a year, then they only pay the smaller, long-term, capital gain on the profit.  I'm not sure whether you can deduct crypto losses as a short-term, or long-term, capital loss, or not?

Same thing, when people buy, or sell, stock, outside of retirement accounts, they incur one of four things: short-term capital gain; short-term capital loss; long-term capital gain, or long-term capital loss.

There is an old tradition on Wall Street called, 'Widows and Orphans Dividend STocks.'  Those were conservative stock that men would buy to financially protect their wives and kids, especially with all the extremely lethal world wars going on back then, and the lessons of the Great Depression.  These were rock solid, juicy, dividend stocks, which paid out divs reliably, and which either went level, a little down over time, or slightly up.  Picture the arch-opposite of mood swings and volatile growth or momentum shock stock.

Get a widows and orphans stock, one that you study first.  Look at one day, five day, one week, one month, six months, YTD, one year, five year, and MAX stock charts on it.  Feel comfortable with this one.  The best of both worlds is to find a unicorn widows and orphans stock you never have to touch, which oddly combines a bit of growth, with a tad of momentum, with a deep and prolific dividend that's always paid out and doesn't skip or disappear.

If you still doubt, pick up the phone, or email, and simply leave a message for your broker's secretary to have them call you back, or shoot out an email to them, and ask them their opinion on what stock they feel is best with 50k.  Be SURE to tell them, 'I want to pick this completely self-directed.  I'm tired of actively managed, fully diversified, funds I can't grab the steering wheel on.'

Oh, I almost forgot to mention.  Divs are taxed, but at a lower rate than anything as abserdly high as short-term gains, or even long-term gain.  They send you a convenient, easy to comprehend, 1099-DIV tax form, and if you use either Turbo Tax, H&R, or Intuit, its seamlessly easy.  No worries, and it just takes a little bit off of your refund, or adds a little to your taxes, but Nothing like outright gains costs.

Best of Luck, and May the Stocks be With You!

Google search, or [MSN.com](https://MSN.com) search, 'Highest Dividend Stocks to Buy Today.'  Best of luck.  'But would you have any Grey Poupon?'  


Load up on a dividend stock that's so high you'd trust it like a spouse, or significant other, or soulmate, or best battle buddy, and then pop the cork to that five years old bottle of Merlot, or your favorite beer, or that bottom shelf Vodka, Gin, or Rum, that you mix with some Cranberry, or Pineapple juice and Coconut shreds, and Coconut juice.  


Then, wake up the next morning, and Google your Rambo dividend stock, which you'll notice doesn't cliffhang, doesn't Airborne Ranger parachutte outta  a C-130, and allows you to sleep at night, like a trusty Rottie, Pitt, German Sheperd, or Dobberman.

7/1/2021 3:34,stocks,"Not investment advice. 

To reduce your risk it can be better not to invest a large lump sum all at once, but drip feed it in, say invest 2k a month over 2 ears. That way if there is a correction in a few months, you don‚Äôt eat a huge loss right up front, but can deploy the rest of the cash to take advantage of it. 

I would personally steer clear of that mutual fund. Those management fees suck up all your alpha. 

I would join seeking alpha and start reading their articles, join some of their stock picking services - even just for a trial - and get their ideas."

They have plans to build an LNG plant in Lake Charles, LA and it is staring to look extremely promising that it will happen.

If you wish to invest 50k into stocks, atleast invest 10k across each stock. Less than 5 stocks is a big risk. Ideally you should invest 50k across 10 stocks but i have already determined that you would not do that.

Also no way you can be assured of guaranteed returns even if you invest in the best companies of today. Yes its likely you will get good returns but there is no such thing as a guarantee in stock market.

Also, in my opinion you can look to invest 25k into US stocks and 25k into another country preferably a developing economy like India, Brazil, Singapore, or even a developed country like Japan via a mutual fund because I believe these countries will show better growth than US in future."

E-commerce: Amazon 
Cyber security: Crowdstrike 
Medical: JNJ

Automotive: Tesla or you could just go with a legacy carmaker

But we are already at all time highs and while it can go higher, it might take decades to see it‚Äôs way to gains through what might be to come(ie inflation, rising rates, geopolitical issues etc.)

Others say buy FAANG +M. Maybe they throw in PayPal or NVDA. These are great companies that make up a huge portion of the indexes and are great companies. However my only issue here is that they aren‚Äôt really a diversified group. Rates go up they all get hit. Money won‚Äôt be cheap forever and look what‚Äôs happened with cheap money in the last year or so. Also no one knows what regulations will come over several years to this group. Maybe nothing but maybe something.  

Still others push you to dump it all in crypto or gamestop or palentir. All huge potential upside and huge potential downside. Don‚Äôt do this. You want relative certainty your money will be there when you check back in several years.  
 
The best answer lies in all of these to be honest. 
Have an index fund. 

Own a few of the big guys. AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT

Find some a group of diversified names that are solid companies. JNJ, POAHY, REGN, DIS, INTC, AMD, DISCA, BOA, MS

Have some plays for the future. CRWD, TAN, LIT

And finally a bit of crypto. Make it a smaller percent of the portfolio but have some in there. 
Bitcoin, ethereum and maybe cardano. 

These would be my picks. They all have a purpose here other than the all too common ‚Äúyo these have been nuts to own until now‚Äù logic i see so frequently here. There are definitely others that would make this list as it is in no way definitive, but I think it would do pretty well. Also if tech gets hit you won‚Äôt lose half, so there‚Äôs that."

I only threw MS in there as it seemed like you wanted some financial exposure. If you're flexible ditching a financial I would put nvda back in there. However MS does have a really attractive dividend.

The reason I like AZN is because it is a very stable healthcare company with a diverse line of breakthrough medicines and it has a decent dividend.

With a long-term timeline, dividend investments will be huge, especially if it's money that you don't need.

However this is only based on your original outline of picking 3 stocks. With 50k to work with I would recommend diversifying a little more-- putting 30-40k in those three, then with the remainder spread it out among some more speculative (not AMC or GME) names.

Agreed with this comment, will just add some color and my own 2 cents:

* **VOO** is S&P, so you get 500 biggest companies in the US
* **VTI** is broad based US so you get those 500 biggest plus the remaining \~3,000 companies in the US. This is about as close to holding the entire US equity market as it gets.
* **VT** is one I would add. It's like having VTI above plus the rest of the world. This is about as close to holding the entire *world* equity market as it gets (US 55%, Rest of World 45%).

If it was me, I'd go VT and chill."

7/1/2021 7:32,stocks,"I completely agree with this. There are any number of ETFs that will generate more stable returns than individual stocks. I‚Äôd also recommend diversifying more. You‚Äôve selected 3 stocks, 2 of which are in the tech sector.  That puts your money at significant risk in the event of a downturn in a specific sector. 

I‚Äôm on mobile right now and can‚Äôt find the link, but there are any number of calculators that will break down recommended asset allocation (large cap, small cap, emerging markets, bonds, etc.) for a given age, risk tolerance, and retirement target. Check one of those out, then do some research on ETFs. I personally use Vanguard for my retirement vehicles, but there‚Äôs lots of other good ones out there."
7/1/2021 7:59,stocks,"I'll just add to this since it's the top comment. 

On top of 2.5% being way too high, it's also not tax deductible. The fee you would pay a broker to trade for you would be less and would be tax deductible. 

If you are looking to get into some stocks, aside from ETF's you should be dealing with an advisor who works for an independent firm. This means they do not have any of their own proprietary products."

Investors lose more money waiting for a crash than they would during the crash itself. The next bear market could be a year, 5, or 10. Leaving all that money sitting because you think you can get a discount based purely on speculation is silly.

Follow the process, buy the stocks, forget them for 1 year, sell your losers before the year is up to claim the tax write off, check the new list, sell all of the other stocks unless any are on the new list (in that case just add to your position) and rinse and repeat every year.

But that's a good point. More general advice would be to first use the money to pay off any high interest debts and maintain an appropriate cash emergency fund.

Another comment mentioned use of a Roth IRA. Another good idea to consider where the money will be invested relative to tax liability and accessibility as needed.

Finally your point about appropriate distribution. Again, not enough details were communicated to really comment on OP's situation. Based on age,  a stock heavy portfolio isn't a terrible idea, but it is worthwhile to review different investment classes, including associated returns/risks, and decide on the approach right for you."

6/30/2021 23:43,stocks,Wealth preservation vs. growth. Not everyone has the same financial objectives.
6/30/2021 23:43,stocks,"3 reasons. 1. I have huge positions in many of high beta high alpha mid cap tech stocks. MSFT acts as a somewhat non correlated hedge in my portfolio. as an example, back in May, some of my mid cap tech stocks got sliced in half due to that ""inflation scare"". MSFT was barely down in that tech sell off. 2. Cap gains and re investment risk. there is always a risk that i sell a winner with huge cap gains tax and invest into a new stock that may not pan out. 3. I tend to let my winners run for long time. excessive trading is what kills most retail investors. 

i actually have much more than 100k in msft. i feel good with my asset allocation tho. it has worked just fine past 5 yrs."

AMD specialises in gaming, data centres, cloud computing and they‚Äôre at the cutting edge of semiconductor technology with their 5nm Zen 4 Ryzen and EPYC CPUs not too far off in the horizon.

TSM are a good choice because they are the fabrication(or fab) making the semiconductors not just for AMD but for a lot of fabless companies including NVDIA, QQOM and Intel.

Edit: Also, TSMC is the largest semiconductor foundry in the world so it‚Äôs a fairly safe bet."
7/1/2021 12:17,stocks,"Watch them and as they drop 25% + from their ATH‚Äôs it‚Äôs usually a decent entry point. Most of these you can get 25% + off their highs multiple times throughout the year.

7/1/2021 0:07,stocks,"Based on the sentiment of mainstream media and people who don‚Äôt care to do research on them yes game-stop seems to be incapable of making big money moves but you are wrong.  This company cleared all debt, raised 1.8 billion after share offerings, have a better than expected quarter, replaced George Sherman with Matt furlong as CEO, who was an amazon director, and the purchase of a giant warehouse that well obviously means they are serious about being an online retailer like amazon and dominating the tech market.  They have expanded from just selling games to selling digital games(meaning it‚Äôs not gonna aim to be a brick and mortar store like many believe), computer hardware (some prebuilt but you could build a pc out of GameStop‚Äôs store), and candy? The most intriguing part is there interest in developing an nft market that is expected to be revealed on July 14th.  I‚Äôm only speculating here but should they develop nfts for cosmetic items and digital copies of games it leads to a huge online resale market.  When you buy a copy of a game from GameStop digitally it will I assume Carey an nft key that will identify it as the exact copy purchased by you but what if you wanted to buy a copy that was played by snoop dog and could be proven by its nft key.  Also imagine being able to trade cosmetics with nfts so you could trade your basic loot box reward for your friends ultra rare armor piece or whatever.  Imagine GameStop hosting auctions for nfts? That‚Äôs very plausible and something I have no doubt they can pull of with all the digital centric experts on the GameStop team.  I am also excited about their interest in streaming.  Twitch at this point is soft core porn so they could definitely make a platform focused on gaming and well if they need to acquire big names like dr. Disrespect or ninja I mean they have the cash to do so."

I think GameStop is going to revolutionize digital gaming. Currently if you buy a game digital, it's done deal. No re-selling, trading, giving your game to a friend, relative. GameStop has dropped hints that they are entering nft space. If games were sold with an NFT backing it? Or you could create an NFT character that can travel thru all gaming worlds. The possibilities are endless, I believe the team involved is going to create things I could never have imagined. 

I'm genuinely excited for the future of gaming with how GameStop is taking charge."

I have 75500 to invest into a TFSA.  I was thinking of putting it all into VFV.TO.  This is long term.  Would you suggest I put it all into this ETF or should I spread it around in a few.  Also is there a point in scaling in or just all in buy?"

I still do it, to protect my sanity if I'm using a huge position. It really shouldn't matter tho"
6/30/2021 22:16,stocks,"The ETF spreads it around for you. Unless you want to specialize.

Although people will tell you it is statistically better on average to put it in all at once this is not correct. An individual is subject to unfavorable market fluctuations shortly after they buy. If you have a 10 year time frame take about 20% of the time to average in, hold and 20% of the time to average out. That would be 2 years averaging in, hold, the last 2 years to average out. It's like insurance, it might cost you a little in missed returns but it might save you a lot. If the market happens to crash then throw it all in.

6/30/2021 22:13,stocks,"Ok let me run an example and you tell me if i'm right.  I have never wrote call options before.  So I can buy around 550 apple shares with $75500.  lets say I write contracts worth 500 shares.  That's 5 contracts. Say the contracts are worth 2.02 with Jul 9th expiry. I would get $725 for the contract.  If the price stays below share price + option price per share, the contracts become useless and i keep the shares and the contract fee.  If it jumps up say $10, my shares are taken away at what I paid for them and i keep the money for the contracts $725.

2 downsides: if the stock goes up a lot i miss out on the profit.  

If it crashes I'm stuck with the bags.

You choose the strike price. 
You can get 500+ shares
 $148 OTM calls are .45
.45x 100= $45 
5 contracts = $225 premium.  Deposited into your account.  

If shares hit $148, you get paid $148 per share.  An $11 per share increase in 10 days going with July 9 expiry.  $5,100 in 10 days. Now you can do same thing except take that your starting with 80,000

If price goes to $158, you get $148 and the gambler gets the stock at a great price. 

Pick a strike price you would be happy with, and a stock you would be happy keeping long term 

TFSA is all tax free

Do this for a few months, $$600 per month for 24 months.  Adds up. Plus you still have the stock, which hopefully is growing.

So let me try again with an example:

I buy apple today at 136.92.  So i can buy 551 shares.

Looking at the options, I choose a monthly at $143 strike price.  For easier math I can write 5 contracts.  The contracts sell for $750.

I get to keep the $750 whatever happens correct? and if the price sky rockets and the call gets exercised i would still make (143 - 136.92) per share? + $750?"

# Risks

The company is witnessing inflation related to raw materials. During January and February 2021, commodity costs grew to its all-time high. The company is encountering supply-related challenges with respect to some of the products including OSB, plywood, lumber and particleboard, thereby leading to the price hike.

Although the demand for single-family residential housing remained very high, the company faced troubles meeting those demands due to labour and material-availability constraints.

The company witnessed volatility in the lumber market throughout 2020. Being a nationwide supplier of building material, the company is very susceptible to fluctuations in market prices for such commodities.

7/1/2021 0:00,stocks,"Question: If we get super high inflation/hyperinflation‚Ä¶ Question: If we get super high inflation/hyperinflation‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt stocks just adjust prices to match that new currency level eventually? Ie if we have a $100 stock and we have money devaluation of 50%, won‚Äôt that stock go to $200 because in efficient markets that company will just adjust its prices to collect more money for its products or services? I understand there will be a lag time in this happening but won‚Äôt that generally be the final result? Anyone know?"
6/30/2021 20:12,stocks,"To an extent yes. Germany, especially in the early stages saw fabulous market gains during the Weimar hyperinflation of the 20‚Äôs. Zimbabwe and Venezuela had similar experiences. 

So yes nominal stock prices would rise, but you still wind up poorer as a practical matter. Inflation eats up those 100% paper gains, and the government will be collecting tax on those gains even though you are no better off.

In addition hyperinflation is damaging to companies. Uncertainty, difficulty financing, needs for greater working capital, among other things does real economic damage to companies so not only are you paying taxes on a 100% gain that isn‚Äôt really a gain at all, the companies you own are also worth less.

It‚Äôs just an ugly situation nobody wants. All you can really say is that holding stock is much better than holding cash which is about the worst thing you can have."
6/30/2021 21:27,stocks,"Not really with hyperinflation. You really only get that if things have gone to shit, and if things have gone to shit your stocks aren't going to do well. 

Hyperinflation isn't even remotely on the table. Interesting thing to think about but that's it."
6/30/2021 23:47,stocks,"As someone who lives in a country haunted by past
of severe hyperinflation, owning stocks (and its prices for the matter) will be the least of your concerns"
6/30/2021 22:11,stocks,"Hyperinflation is defined as 50%+ in one month. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs likely, but we are coming out of decades of super low inflation, which probably has a lot to do with deflation in consumer good prices from China. Right now, even moderate inflation is jarring to a country used to no inflation. If it sticks around,‚Ä¶. Buy silver and gold."
6/30/2021 23:28,stocks,"True hyperinflation affects different assets differently. If you think that your paycheck will buy alot less, you will tend to only buy the necessities. So, food and energy see the biggest price increases. Stocks will probably increase, but goods and services will increase more. So, in real terms, value of stocks will decrease compared to goods and services."
7/1/2021 1:37,stocks,How fast can you sell your shares so you can eat? How fast can everybody else? What does this do to share price? Hooe you sold first! This is what haopens to the stock market during true hyperinflation. Giddyup
7/1/2021 4:06,stocks,"You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what determines stock price that is fairly common in the current market I would say.  

Stock price is based on earnings.  It is not intrinsic value that is inflation hedged.  Most stocks do not increase earnings with inflation dollar for dollar.  Even if they did, there are many factors including revenue, costs, risk premium that all are going to change with inflation.   The last one I mentioned is the most important.  As when there is sustained inflation, the expected return will absolutely rise, and this will always bring stock price down.   So not only do stocks have to match inflation dollar for dollar, they actually have to beat it on a percentage basis in terms of ROI in order to break even in an inflationary environment."
7/1/2021 14:45,stocks,"I am interested in the real answer to this too. It is my understanding that hiking interest rates is impossible due to the already astronomical government debt, meaning there is no ammunition against high inflation. Since the money expansion continues in order to inflate their way out of the debt while pumping the economy, it could really only mean inflation in the short to medium term. This translates to stocks and real estate being smart holds unless I am missing something critical."
6/30/2021 22:24,stocks,Enough with hyperinflation posts ffs
6/30/2021 20:03,stocks,We wont
7/1/2021 1:22,stocks,"In fact, they will adjust price more rapidly than just about anything else. We're seeing the inflation in the stock and housing markets already, it will level off a bit as equilibrium is achieved. 

So yes, they will. But we won't see hyperinflation. We wouldn't see hyperinflation even if the government printed the $30T we owe tomorrow. The stock market would 10x and so would houses, consumer goods would slowly catch up, but it wouldn't be barrels of money for a loaf of bread. Don't get me wrong, it's a horrible idea, but it wouldn't end capitalism as we know it."

7/1/2021 2:25,stocks,This needs to be higher. Equity as an asset class has negatively correlated *real* returns with inflation delta. Ppl haven‚Äôt seen inflation in so long they apparently only comprehend nominal returns.
7/1/2021 15:09,stocks,What was your experience with hyperinflation?
7/1/2021 7:26,stocks,"Like in the 70s when wage increases masqueraded as real increase, but they were eaten up by inflation.  The more I keep seeing about wage increases now, the more I'm terrified of another wage price spiral."
6/30/2021 20:30,stocks,No way the market is forward looking. The fed has to remove eight trillion from their balance sheet. No way that is priced in.
6/30/2021 21:59,stocks,Some companies have little debt and i expect them to rocket rocket rocket. Look at FB balance sheet. It‚Äôs pretty clean aka no debt
7/1/2021 12:20,stocks,"For most of us real inflation was well before our time. To have been in the market when we had the last one you would have to be in your mid 60‚Äôs. The only asset class that did well was energy. That in turn has a couple issues 

1. The conditions in the 70‚Äôs had some extenuating factors unrelated to inflation that made energy attractive

2. there are specific trends today related to renewables that make energy less attractive.

I don‚Äôt have much that acts as a good inflation hedge, but I do own LIFZF which is a Canadian iron ore royalty trust. The attraction there is as iron prices rise so do your payments, but company expenses don‚Äôt tend to rise in tandem so you don‚Äôt have the negative effects of inflation on employee wages, working capital etc.

I would be buying energy royalty trusts as a hedge except there is that big picture trend of moving away from oil and natural gas. 

There really isn‚Äôt a good answer here other than to stay away from cash if you really think hyperinflation is coming. The problem is asset valuations are at nosebleed levels so if we don‚Äôt get hyperinflation you risk a crash to more reasonable prices.

Pick your poison."
6/30/2021 20:18,stocks,"So imagine you have something like European Union except is more close and everything is kinda regulated. This much production goes here that much production goes there. The countries in USSR ( Soviet Union or how ever u call it) is like a brick wall. And in one moment u start taking out bricks from that wall and in one moment the system collapse. I ain‚Äôt a pro Soviet Union. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. My parrents were ok. They were the ppl who got green cards straight after the collapse of the Soviet Union so we were kinda ok. But all the rest were boom nothing. Imagine a factory that produces tomatoes. This factory sells to 5 countries tomatoes. The factory has 1000 employees. There is no private sector. Everything is government sector. In one moment a union collapse and every country is for itself. You can‚Äôt find investors. You can‚Äôt pay salaries because u don‚Äôt sell the products because no one works for free. The country starts printing more and more money and etc. And from there u get the inflation. After that is hyperinflation. Then there is bankruptcy. I remember just gonna give u the example of bulgarian currency fliped in us dollars. Today the bread costs $0.45 tomorrow becomes $1 after 5 days $10 after thar they change the banknotes from 1 5 10 20 50 100 to 1000 5000 100000 20000 100 k. And one bread becomes 1000. Prices continue growing( now its private sector) money continue getting zeros on the back in one moment. The country decides to take a huge loan for 30 yrs. sell all government properties ( factories) to private foreign investors who actually bankrupts them for loans. From there you get the unemployment cause there is no where to work and then the loan which the country took makes to cover the major sectors. At this time 1 years passed. The government already agrees on deals to open borders with other countries. Usa comes gives a shit plan which will not work but same time gives green cards like french fries and gets the ppl they need for projects they didn‚Äôt knew ( don‚Äôt get me wrong things which the west didn‚Äôt knew the east knew and the opposite). Ppl start going abroad sending money to their parrents. Usa Canada and etc were in the fastest economical growth( 90s). Salaries were huge for those ppl. $1 was equal to 5 bglev. ( now $1 is equal to 1.50 bglev) u get the country joining EU. nato. U don‚Äôt need to feed 180 k army of ppl cause u are in NATO and EU so u reduce it to i think 10 k now. Most of barracks are shut. No government production. Everything is privatised. So businesses starts moving. That‚Äôs the experience of hyperinflation. In American way is never gonna happen. Similiar like ours was the british economy crash i think in the 70s when two ppl split a job per week or something. My history memories about their crash is blurry. I studied but wasn‚Äôt the same. U see u have one thing called federal bank. Guys your currency is leading currency ( at least another 20-30 yrs). U say ( your government‚Äôs ) say INFLATION HYPERINFLATION... and in the end they print more money stability for5-10 yrs and yet another crash and another debt and another printing... etc etc. Usa had hyperinflation but non of us were born. The population was way smaller. Organise crime was bigger.. so listen when USA says hyperinflation i just smile üòÄ and say... yeah... 4% hyperinflation. Google hyperinflation eastern europe and u will understand. Also forgot to mention PRIVATE BANKS was the buggest issue because the central bank of Bulgaria guarantee those loans from the private banks that took the money from european banks and world bank and they just withdrew the banks and bankrupted... i remember the number till today first 500 and later 2000 PERCENT
Now we are still the poorest EU member ( if North Macedonia joins EU they will be the poorest üòÄ) but we are one of the biggest outsourcing countries in IT and Finances after Check Republic for Europe. Together with Romania. We are good in IT and finances for some reason but government is worse then your theatre with Biden and Trump üòÄ
And for finishing- u can‚Äôt prepare. U have to have two things physical to survive GOLD AND SILVER. Not investment ones. Actual ones. Cause gold is always high price in hyperinflation

- Legislators trying to freeze prices (which is an obviously stupid idea), and leads to:

7/1/2021 0:00,stocks,"Making money by inverting negative sentiment created by stock bashing and trolling This works particularly well for penny stocks which are more prone to rapid sentiment changes and price swings.

I found a trend. I tested it out. It actually worked out well for me several times now. But it‚Äôs a really difficult strategy to execute.

My theory was that you can identify a good entry point in a stock based on a negative change in online sentiment which is NOT correlated to company news and updates or market performance etc.

I believed that if the online sentiment changed to a negative one overall without there being an underlying reason, that it was a good sign that people shorting the stock were anxious to keep the price down and others were bashing it online to get a better entry point.

My theory is that the bashing behaviour doesn‚Äôt occur at random. It occurs strategically.

If people know the share price is going to go up in the mid term and want to keep it quiet to get a better entry point there are going to be some people who attack the stock online to try to bring the price down to give themselves more time for a lower buy in point.

If people have been shorting a stock and need time to exit their positions as they are anticipating a rise in share price they will be inclined to do the same as well.

So, in a way, online stock bashing could be seen as an inverse indicator of the current overall expectations of the actual future share price.

Here‚Äôs how the strategy works. Use websites that provide indicators of stock sentiment on social media. Pick out companies which have recently had strong negative sentiment. Figure out if there is a valid reason for the change in sentiment based on publicly available information about the company.

If nothing has changed in the companys underlying performance and they were in an uptrend before the negative sentiment began, begin to investigate the nature of the online sentiment.

Go on Reddit, Stocktwits or Twitter and actually read through all the comments you can find. Check to see whether or not the negative comments are baseless.

If the sentiment of the stock online is negative for a good reason, such as anticipating a logical negative outcome, then stay away.

If the comments bashing the stock are baseless and can‚Äôt be backed up by logic, fact or reasonable predictions then you probably have a winner.

Unfortunately this strategy can be stressful. You have to read a lot of negativity. You have to think critically and have extensive knowledge of how the market and businesses work. You have to be able to discern bullshit and emotional statements from logic. You have to be able to tell the difference between genuine criticism of a company‚Äôs performance and false criticism which can sound logical but often skews the facts to try to generate a negative view of the company. But those types of statements won‚Äôt stand up to solid research on the company.

If a stock is being heavily attacked online using flawed logic and emotional statements and there are no red flags about the company other than a recent change in share price caused by the above bashing and trolling behaviours then you probably have a good buy in point as the stock will now have an unfair lower price point caused exclusively by bashers.

If you strongly believe this is the case and there is no discernible grey area after solid investigation, just buy the stock. Ignore websites that give price targets as those are always generated based on existing numbers including the dips caused by bashing.

You have to be willing to hold until the bashing behaviour subsides or until the company‚Äôs performance proves them wrong. Once it does and investor sentiment returns to the norm you will gain by the artificial price suppression being lifted. In addition, companies being bashed like this usually have something going for them so you can capitalize on their progress at the same time.

I guess you could say this strategy basically takes advantage of trolls and bashers and uses the price suppression resulting from their online behaviour as leverage to amplify your gains."

7/1/2021 0:00,stocks,"100% of school buses could be electric within 15 years: Lion Electric VP Add the funding from the ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù bill and the buses should start rolling!

Electric school buses may be the next wave of EVs to hit the commercial market, one executive within the industry says.
Patrick Gervais, Lion Electric (LEV) VP of marketing and communication, discussed the progress made with electric vehicles on a Yahoo Finance Live segment Tuesday afternoon.
‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a really good intention to electrify 100% of school buses within the next couple of years,‚Äù Gervais said. ‚ÄúWe could feel the hype all across the United States. I mean, we‚Äôve delivered buses in New York, in Minnesota, all across the country.‚Äù
The infrastructure bill, which is supported by President Biden, is expected to provide an additional $15 billion to electric vehicles infrastructure. Under the framework of the bill,  $7.5 billion is to be allocated to schools and public transit organizations to help convert to electric buses.
Gervais noted that a transition to electric school buses would have a plethora of benefits besides a reduction in carbon emissions. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no noise pollution, so it‚Äôs more quiet and the kids are more calm and more concentrated when they go to school,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThese are the kids and the people of tomorrow [who] will drive electric cars in the future.‚Äù
Currently, less than 1% of school buses are electric. Over 400,000 school buses drive over 3.5 billion miles each year, according to a Bellwether Education Partners study. The transition to electric buses will take initiative, but with the right moves, Gervais said, the entirety of the US school bus fleet could be electrified in 10-15 years.
Abroad, electric vehicles have sparked the interest of consumers of late ‚Äî 11% of the 11.6 million new cars registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and Britain last year were either fully electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Meanwhile, EVs and plug-ins accounted for less than 3% of new car sales in the United States.

6/30/2021 23:04,stocks,"There's really 2 questions here to determine the timeline.

1) How long does a school bus typically last before it needs replaced?

2) How long will it take for battery tech to improve & come down in cost enough to make it economically viable (by 'economically viable' lets say equal in purchase price to an ICE school bus without government subsidies)

While I'm very bullish on EV's and how fast the tech will kill off ICE vehicles in the new vehicle market due to pure economic reasons (imo EV's will be the majority of new vehicle sales by 2025, or 2026 at the very latest), I think 10 years is too aggressive a target to replace ALL school buses on the road. To be honest I think 15 years may be a stretch for 100% of the school buses to be replaced as well. Buying a new fleet of school buses is expensive, it makes sense to try to stretch the life of ICE ones as long as you can. Not to mention we're only just now getting the first BEV semi and pickup trucks on the road, so chances are there's going to be next to zero EV adoption of school buses in the next year or two."
6/30/2021 20:24,stocks,if you account for food co2 production and food burned needed to go X distance. food is very inefficient at transportation. lets say a moped can get 100 miles on 1 gal of gas... to walk 100 miles would require 10 pounds of food which is a lot more co2 emmisoins and expensive than 1 gal of gas.

7/1/2021 0:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, June 30, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 30, 2021**

*Please Note: Apologies for not sending the Daily Recap out yesterday, I was having technical issues on my end. Thankfully, all the issues were resolved, it's full steam ahead.*

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after hitting record highs for many consecutives days. In short, stocks continue to hover near record highs. Market participants are encouraged a stronger-than-expected gain on private payrolls and tempered inflationary fears. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Q2 earnings season and incoming economic data. 

Today, ADP‚Äôs June private payroll report showed private payrolls increased faster than expected[.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adp-june-private-payrolls-jobs-market-pandemic-economy-recovery-121542029.html) This underscores the ongoing economic recovery with the US economy reporting its sixth straight monthly increase in employment. Job openings rose by 692,000 versus the 600,000 expected. Consumer confidence has also risen and pointed to Americans' increased propensity to spend, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index racing to its highest level since February 2020. 

David Lefkowitz, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Equities, said ‚ÄúIf you look at what's really been powering the economy and powering the stock market, it's been the fact that there's been so much fiscal stimulus poured into the economy. What's really crucial though is that a lot of that fiscal stimulus has actually not been spent this year. It's sitting on the balance sheets of consumers."" I totally agree. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. Now that the economy is reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, I expect saving-laden consumers to step out and spend big this summer after enduring social distancing guidelines for more than a year. 

Today marks the last trading session of the second quarter of the year, so I thought it would be useful to take a look back at the performance of different assets since March. Year-to-date through Tuesday's close, the S&P 500 has increased 14.3%, the Nasdaq by 12.7% and the Dow by 12%. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a year-to-date peak of 1.77% in March but is on track to end the quarter yielding just under 1.5%. The West Texas intermediate crude oil rebounded by 23% as demand for energy picks up. Digital currencies, on the other hand, had a very difficult quarter, with prices sharply down across the board compared to the beginning of the quarter. 

**Highlights**

* Pending home sales were up 8% in May month-on-month, helping reverse April's 4.4% drop, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. This brought the pending home sales index to 114.7, or the highest reading for the month of May since 2005. 
* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi (DIDI) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company sold 316.8 million shares to raise $4.4 billion, making it one of the largest initial public offerings of a Chinese company in the U.S. since Alibaba's (BABA) $25 billion listing in 2014. Trading began trading at $18, roughly 29% higher than its $14 IPO price, though throughout the session the stock lost most of its IPO gains. 
* General Mills (GIS) said it is raising prices across nearly all its grocery categories by around 7% due to higher costs for ingredients and labor. 
* Ford Motor (F) said it will be forced to cut output across more than a half-dozen U.S. factories in July due to continued pressure from the global shortage in semiconductors.
* PayPal (PYPL) is intensifying competition with Square (SQ) by launching its own physical card reader to put in stores. While both are undisputed leaders in fin-tech, PYPL has always focused more intensely on peer-to-peer transactions while SQ put more of an emphasis on consumer-to-business transactions.
* Twitter Inc on Tuesday named Sarah Personette as chief customer officer to oversee the social media platform's global ad sales, global content partnerships and revenue operations. The company has been making a big push to increase revenue lately. 
* **\*\*Current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***
* Salesforce (CRM) target raised by Evercore from $290 to $300 at Outperform. Stock currently around $244
* Crowdstrike (CRWD) target raised by Truist Securities from $250 to $300 at Buy. Stock currently around $252
* Facebook (FB) target raised by Argus from $385 to $410 at Buy. Stock currently around $349
* Hess (HESS) target raised by Wells Fargo from $98 to $104 at Overweight. Stock currently around $87.50
* Paychex (PAYX) target raised by Citigroup from $1095 to $121 at Buy. Stock currently around $107
* Shopify (SHOP) with two target raises. Stock currently around $1464
   * Loop Capital from $1400 to $1600 at Buy
   * Royal Bank of Canada from $1500 to $1700 at Outperform
* Exxon Mobil (XOM) target raised by Wells Fargo from $67 to $72 at Overweight. Stock currently around $63

I'm 18 and banking with Wells Fargo - my money has a lot of time to sit.

(As for indexes, I don't have the kind of money to buy more than 4 shares of S&P directly lol. I was more so contemplating and comparing all the ETFs that track an index/mutual funds, for example.

Ok, so, I only started actively investing in April of this year and only $25 a paycheck, because you know, don't invest more than you can stand to lose. I check the Nasdaq's IPO calendar every so often and saw LegalZoom just waiting to be picked up today. I'm not very analytical in my approach to stocks at the moment because there is so much to learn/know, and even then it's a bit of a crap shoot.

So, I saw LZ on robinhood this morning with a price of $28.00. I put a limit order in at 9AM for a few shares at $28.00 because it wasn't actively being traded yet. So I check in a short time ago to look at something else and see that the order wasn't executed and the price jumped to roughly $36.

Can someone kindly explain to me what happened? If the initial price listed was $28.00, then why wasn't it executed at $28 when it was open for trade?"

6/30/2021 21:51,stocks,"$28 was the IPO price--The price that LZ sold their shares to the institutions and accredited investors (usually over $1MM liquid net worth).

Once trading started, those institutions and accredited investors can sell their shares at any price they want.  Unsurprisingly, they were only willing to sell the shares at a much higher price, as noted in this CNBC article:*""The stock opened at $36.75 per share after an initial public offering price of $28 each.""*

To get access, you'd need to have a (large) account at one of the IPO underwriters/IBs  or maybe a broker (Fidelity, Schwab, etc) who may have shares allocated to them.

*(Also from CNBC: ""There were 14 underwriters, led by J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Barclays."")*"
6/30/2021 22:33,stocks,Change it GTC if you want it at that price.  It will fill in the next few weeks probably.
6/30/2021 23:41,stocks,"Only certain people get to trade an IPO for an hour or two before it opens on the market. The price can go up a lot in that time and pop even more when it opens to the public for the first day or week. You should almost never buy an IPO on the first day even if you have super confidence in the company and especially if you don't have additional cash to average down when it inevitably drops.
You didn't shoot yourself in the foot, you dodged a loss."
7/1/2021 13:05,stocks,You can now with PSTH.
7/1/2021 0:56,stocks,This is your answer.
6/30/2021 21:43,stocks,"When you see a price on a stock that only means it's the last price it was traded at or depending on the broker some other form, in case of an IPO it's what was determined from get go. That doesn't mean jackshit though as it reflects the past or a more or less made up reality (like bids+ask/2). 

If you see a stock that shows a price of 100$ and you buy 20 shares you will pay whatever another person is willing to sell for, and using a limit order mitigates risk. In theory on a market order and only 1 other person selling, you will pay whatever he puts up. So if that's 1k per share you pay 1k per share. Then the price will jump up to 1k instantly and trigger a lot of take profits that have no limit alongside them. Those will attempt to instantly sell due to this but since they are market sells the highest buyer will be chosen, meaning as the price was 100$ it will be below 100 (well, at least likely) and jump down.

Same reason why the entire squeeze story is to a big part made up. They make people believe when it shows 5k on a stock you get 5k. On a liquid market that's also likely, but not on an event that's so out of line and has only a single buyer."

7/1/2021 0:00,stocks,"21 decisions to sell, got almost all of them wrong I've always suspected that one of the most costly mistakes I've made when investing has been selling prematurely, but I never dug through my data to determine if that was actually true.  So I decided to do that.  I went back over 21 separate decisions I've made to sell stocks over the past 12-18 months to see what happened in the months after the sales.

None of these were short-term trades, they were all intended to be long-term investments when I bought them but ended up deciding to sell.  Sometimes it was based on technical signals (new downtrends, violation of the 50 day moving average, price running up too fast and getting over-extended beyond the 50 DMA) but other times it was based on concerns about valuation.  Sometimes it was pure impatience, getting frustrated with a stock going nowhere and wanting to find a better opportunity.

Out of the 21 sell decisions, 18 of them turned out to be wrong in the sense that the price ended up higher than my sell price within the ensuing weeks and months.  In only 3 of the 21 cases did the decision to sell turn out to be a good one.  But the important thing is what I can learn from this to improve my decisions in the future.  Here are some observations:

1) A break below the 50 day moving average is a very unreliable sell signal, especially if the stock remains in a longer term uptrend.  Price dropping below the 50 DMA theoretically signals a change in the medium term trend, which could foretell the beginning of a longer term downtrend.  But in almost every case where I sold after the stock dropped below the 50 DMA, it reversed course within days and continued up.  The only case where this turned out to be a good signal was when the stock traded below the 50 DMA for several weeks.

2) Don't sell stocks based on concern about valuation.  Valuing stocks isn't an exact science; I'm not a professional and even professionals can have very different opinions about the fair value of a stock.  In every single case where I sold because I thought the stock got ""overvalued,"" it continued climbing.  This is where some of my biggest mistakes happened in terms of lost profits.  For example, I sold APPS last October for a 6x return at $32 only to watch it hit $100 within 5 months.

3) Selling when the stock dropped was always a mistake.  This overlaps with (1) because the drops typically coincided with a technical signal (breaking below the 50 DMA or breaking a support level), but every time that happened the stock reversed course soon after.  Unless the selloff reflects an underlying change in the long-term prospects for the business, you should be taking advantage of drops to buy not sell.

To be fair to myself, some of these decisions could have turned out to be correct if I moved the money elsewhere and saw better returns than if I had left the money where it was.  But the results clearly show that premature selling is a costly mistake."

I sold Nvidia at 160 after the 40% drop it had for the sales that didnt match expectation

I sold Plus500 at a - 40% for accounting fraud  when now it has fully recovered. 

I sold 60 eth at 300$ thinking they will never get anywhere and they got to 4.200 a few months ago.

It was sad but also eye opening. I picked up great assets, I just had to be more patient and wait a few years.

6/30/2021 20:19,stocks,"I absolutely agree. In my own experience, selling has almost always tended to be a costly mistake. I bought a stock for a reason. When I bought the stock, it was never with the intention to sell. However, some time later, I almost always forgot the reason why I bought it in the first place and end up selling it and move on to the next shiny object.

I bought Ferroglobe (GSM) when it was 2.74 because it seemed a bit too down. #1 in silica and by-products that support battery and solar panel production. #2 was 25. Heavy debt they were paying off and depressed profits by the pandemic. They had a decent amount of cash to float them, a plan they developed, and worked things out. They are currently over 6, and they supply needs for solar energy.

2. Ignoring size of trade.  
3. Ignoring dividends

For a simplistic example if after a chart dips below the 50-DMA only sell it if after 5 trading days it still remains below for instance. Setting up multiple parameters for selling or buying is a huge hedge against false signals and reversals.

Also in my experience a reversal signaled off of a false signal ends up some of the strongest indicators of price direction in my experience. It's almost exciting to me when a signal has clearly failed because it's been my confident experience this most reliably indicates price will move significantly in the reverse direction more so than any other form of TA analysis."

I actually did that with APPS, my biggest mistake.  I bought it a while back at 5.09 and watched it run strongly in the early COVID growth move.  I thought it had gotten way overextended and overvalued, so I sold it at \~23 with the plan to buy back in after a pullback.  Well it never pulled back, so I ended up buying back in at \~25 and then sold again later.  I would have been much, much, much better off if I just held the damn thing from the beginning."

That's what happened after the dot-com bubble burst, and it's what will happen when the Fed stops printing money. Everyone has become used to every dip being bought up violently in a week. Like the October 2020 correction - the market dropped hard for 2 weeks, and then snapped back and rallied past that point in one week in early November. When the fed stops printing money, those types of super fast snapback rallies will not happen anymore. The money just won't be there."

Then from April 26th to may 16th alot of my stocks where tanking and I didn't even worry I was down to about 1% gains for the year on the 16th and was feeling pretty bad but I decided not to sell since last time it was disastrous and now I'm up 20% on the year today at close.

It's hard starting out but a good saying I learned from thestockguy he's a streamer I watch is "" if your learn from your mistakes they are investments""

7/1/2021 6:35,stocks,"Exactly.  Just because you missed on on potential gains on something you sold doesn't mean you didn't make something, or even more, with what you bought.

As a long-term investor, if you had the conviction to purchase the stock, what changed?  How well did you understand the company, its prospects, its management and its market before you invested your money?  Or did something change of which you were not aware (which begs the prior question)?

I invest and I trade.  I am clear on which is which but sometimes my confidence does get tested and I have to check myself.  Sometimes I just take profits and violate my own rules - I‚Äôm human and sometimes want mine now.  Working on getting better at investing but it ain‚Äôt easy."

Firgure out a niche that you love and just read everything you can get your hands on. Read critically, there's a lot of self-serving BS out there. Read things you disagree with and make sure you're not wrong in what you believe. It's hard to give general advice because there are so many paths you could take.

1. If you're selling it and leaving it as cash, it's probably a mistake long term since the market tends to beat cash.

2. If it's just being reinvested in something else, you need to examine opportunity cost.  Odds are you're just exchanging one appreciating asset for another, and the amount you're gaining or losing is just the difference between their ROIs.

While I‚Äôm currently enjoying the fact that my warrant purchase has provided me with a 535% return (as of today), I‚Äôm trying to work out my strategy when the warrants are either called by the company or when 2024 arrives, whichever comes first. I am bullish on PAVM. 

Let‚Äôs assume that PAVM goes to $10 a share, and PAVMZ reaches $8.40 at the same time. The way I see it, I can either a) pay the $12,800 to exercise the warrants and ride with 8,000 shares of PAVM stock at $1.60, or b) sell the warrants for $67,200 and buy 6,720 shares of PAVM.

7/1/2021 7:31,stocks,"I don't blame you, the concept of robotic process automation (RPA) is simple but what the technology actually does is not well understood unless you're in the industry. The goal of RPA is to essentially replace human workers that perform repetitive/rule based tasks. Think of office tasks like HR hiring, firing, moving positions, salary increases, etc. 

The concept really is that simple, take a repetitive task and you automated every step that the human did. The automation is quicker, more reliable, and can work 24 hours a day. This is a simple use case, the more complex use case is to use it for interconnecting systems that normally wouldn't talk to each other. My company has found great use in this, for example take software ""X"" that can only output a file to a local directory. That file then has to be uploaded to software ""Y"" which is completely unrelated to X. Previously a human would have to manually upload that file, but now with RPA we can write code to interact with the file system and upload it to the desired portal. You can do this without RPA but you would have to use different technologies and probably a few days worth of work whereas I can do this in minutes with RPA.

One last nugget that not many see, the inherent nature of this RPA technology is to want to utilize it MORE. You want to find more automations because that means more savings. This translates to more licenses and more purchasing of services. Once a customer is hooked on RPA they will never go back and they will continue to look for more automations which translate to more and more sales for the automation company. It's a software that will LITERALLY upsell itself. 

I hope that helps you understand, as I mentioned I think UI Path is a bit overvalued at the moment but consider the only other public company I can think of in the space which is blue prism. I personally believe their technology is superior and will win out in the long run."

What I believe, though, is that these things are mostly decided by the first company to figure out *how* to use the technology, not create the technology from scratch. I'm sorry for bringing up Apple again like a broken record, but that's what they do. There's been MP3 players before the iPod, touchscreen devices before the iPhone ([oh boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton)), smart watches before the Apple Watch, wireless headphones before the AirPods... Even Android came out *after* iOS. So I'm not sure what facebook is all about with being ""first"". 

What matters is being the first to pitch a mature hardware product with a viable use case. Meeting my family for dinner isn't one, IMO. I have video communication on my smartphone but I text people, because it's a better form of communication for most cases. 

What I see for AR is actual productivity increases. A literal 3D desktop that lives in your glasses. That's a monumental UX challenge, one that hasn't been figured out yet. And I don't feel like facebook understands this, they're all about locking down their ecosystem and making 3D avatars... I don't think that's what will sell people on AR. I rather see an office environment, something rather dry."

 >The Newton is a series of personal digital assistants (PDAs) developed and marketed by Apple Computer, Inc. An early device in the PDA category (the Newton originated the term), it was the first to feature handwriting recognition. Apple started developing the platform in 1987 and shipped the first devices in August 1993. Production officially ended on February 27, 1998. Newton devices ran on a proprietary operating system, Newton OS; examples include Apple's MessagePad series and the eMate 300, and other companies also released devices running on Newton OS.

7/1/2021 9:33,stocks,"I actually do agree it often matters who is first to figure out a use case, but I think quest 2 has that figured out. They sold 5 million of them. They are first to market with a viable use case. Gaming was always how you got the headset in the house. Facebook is likely selling these at a loss so its pretty much a country wide tech demo sponsored by them.

Facebook is pushing hard for industrial use of the headset, I think they see the same thing you do. They've purchased a couple 3d modeling companies recently, likely to work on some sort of construction app. The industry uses for real estate and construction are already being explored. My GF's new apartment had a vr tour for showingns. Eventually theyl be able to take blueprints and reconstruct a house, so you can actually see what a house will look like before its built. FB is throwing every possible use at the wall and seeing what sticks.

Apple doesn't scare me for a couple reasons. First is they are way behind, and don't seem to really care. Second, they don't have the same corporate  vision for the space. I know that in 5 years FB will still be pushing VR heavily and investing in the space. In 5 years Apple might just be doing ai cars, iPhone 35 etc. They have not demonstrated the same commitment."

In fact the *closest to a real shortage* was during the 90s since manual cameras used a notable amount of silver for their film. With digital cameras taking over solve reprice tanked and stayed low for years since the supply has been ridiculous much higher since a major business died more or less over night. Even all modern tech today doesn't use close to as much...and won't for a foreseeable future.




Diversifying is never bad so buy physical in some way and hold, given enough time you'll make a profit. That said silver as a *store of value* is very overrated, as we saw during the Corona-crash. Gold went to the moon and silver went to...a nearby hill. The low value of silver makes it a poor choice, a mere 10k of silver means no less then 11-12kg physical metal. That's not very easy to move, especially not if you have larger sums.

Second best is letting someone else store it for you, physical backing. You'll pay a small premium for the service but it's the safest and most efficient way for a trader.



Least secure and most BS is buying papers. Not backed when whi hits the fan or your commodity explodes, decent for a short term volatility-play but not worth it long term since the risk of getting fooled is to high."
6/30/2021 23:58,stocks,"No, that falls apart when people can ask for delivery. Inventories drop too low, and issuing unbacked shorts becomes a massive risk, that the other side of the trade asks you to pony up bullion you don‚Äôt have and won‚Äôt take cash."

7/1/2021 8:34,stocks,"People don't ask for delivery.

Even when the US was on ""the gold standard"" the reserve requirement was only 25%. There was always way more cash than the government could have given out. And then they just made it illegal to ask, or to own any gold that wasn't ornamental or numismatically collectible.

6/30/2021 23:34,stocks,"I understand, what your getting at is that the ""inefficiencies"" of democratic style governments. 

&#x200B;

There are people who argue that democratic governments are very inefficient and the larger it gets the more the cracks start to show. They argue that having a longer term leader at the top something equivalent to  China or Russia is more efficient because things get done much faster without delay. Instead of arguing over funding this or that, the leader at the top would just make the best decision within days instead of weeks or months. 

&#x200B;

Me personally, I prefer democratic governments because I like that they are slow moving and fair to all the citizens. If you are not careful you have a country like China or Russia or North Korea where just a few at the top benefit and hold unlimited control over every citizen forever.  In the USA we have the concept of freedom and equality. 

 In the long term are democracies the best? Maybe not. They tend to fail miserably.  But for my short lifetime that I spend on earth here, I want to live in a democracy where I can feel like I have a free life (even if it is an illusion)."

>Corsair had a ridiculous year and only recently went public

Logitech had an even better year. They also have a wider audience in gaming, enterprise and the general public. Corsair is strictly gaming and already have large market shares in the products they sell.

They are also trading at a similar P/E, if Corsair had a 20B market cap their P/E would be insane. The one thing that could justify something like that would be insane growth but they're not even outgrowing Logitech right now and Logitech even offers dividends.

Besides, the eventual return to normal from COVID might affect both companies negatively in the short term.

It's good you have conviction in their future but there is plenty of bear case for Corsair that you should consider. 20B evaluation for Corsair right now would be absolutely outrageous. Imo they are at about fair price right now."

As I said, if you have **equal** conviction. Of **course** they won't perform the same, that's literally the point. You can have equal conviction over all of them but you can still be wrong.

By holding 5 stocks you have 5 stocks than can underperform or even go to 0 by holding 6 stocks now you have 6 stocks that can underperform and/or go to 0, not much of a difference, in fact you just introduced more risk by having an extra stock that can go bad and cripple your portfolio while reducing your potential returns at the same time.

>Everyone should pick their single highest conviction stock and dump everything into that right?

No, most people should avoid picking individual stocks and diversify as much as they can because most people are bad at picking stocks. Only people that are good at picking stocks would be better picking their single highest conviction instead of going for 5+."
7/1/2021 19:24,stocks,"By extension you are saying there is no risk reduction associated with going from 5-6 but there is one in an etf with a 100 holdings so you are looking at a a graph with an asymptote, sudden jump in risk reduction that seems highly unlikely and contradicts every academic paper i read on the subject most show a symptomatic risk reduction upto 40 holdings, afterwards the risk reduction per additional holding declines and starts aproaching 0 i have a degree in CS so im not unfamilar with math myself."
6/30/2021 21:13,stocks,"That's where you're wrong.  Adding a stock definitely helps diversify no matter how small your portfolio is.  Even more, actually.  Adding a stock to a 1 stock portfolio diversifies the portfolio by 100%.  Adding a stock to a 2 stocks portfolio diversifies by 50%.  In OP's examples adding a 6th stock to a 5 stock portfolio diversifies it by 20%.  That's a lot.

Never underestimate the power of diversification.  If one of your holdings goes to zero then it makes a huge difference whether your portfolio is 3 stocks vs 5 stocks."

I'm also holding a bunch of my assets in cash, treasury bonds, commodities and other assets. The idea is that when stocks go down, some of these other assets will go up.

To say there are only two reasons a founder would leave is that there is fraud or that they were ousted is just wrong and narrow viewed.

Obviously its pure speculation but did you ever think maybe there is some kind of apple connection with Canoo? (I know unlikely but there have been 2-3 apple connections in the past year and it is a bit strange) Or even more likely - Kranz got Canoo where it needed to be with his skillset and then wanted to move onto something new? The guy has like a million shares in Canoo he obviously still wants the company to be successful.

Dont see why everything has to always automatically be negative...

To be clear, it is entirely possible he was ousted, but to say it with such certainty and no actual facts is not helpful for people looking for quality info.
